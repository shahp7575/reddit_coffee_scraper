1osfrei,https://www.reddit.com/r/askanything/comments/1osfrei/how_to_clear_up_an_ambiguous_situation_with_a/,How to clear up an ambiguous situation with a friend?,"Haven't dated in eight years, so a bit clueless. So I met this guy at a year-end party work event last year. We don't work together; he's from another company. We exchanged numbers and sent each other small gifts. He started texting me memes, random stuff about his life, books he's reading, anything really to keep in touch. Then, after texting for almost a year, I asked him if he wanted to have coffee with me to get to know him more. He said yes and after our coffee meetup, he insisted on driving me home. His place is almost two hours away from my place since we live in opposite directions. He started offering to drive me to work and school where I am taking my masters, insisting on fetching me, one to two times a week. I offered to meet him halfway, but he didn't want me to commute long distance. We have lunches and dinners. He'd give thoughtful gifts, nothing expensive, e.g. my favorite snack, an item I'm looking for but cant find at the grocery store, etc. We talk nonstop about anything and everything whenever we meet.

I really like him; he makes me feel safe and happy, but he's never flirted with me or broken the touch barrier, so I'm not sure if he likes me romantically.

He's incredibly kind, shy, and gentle. He also gets embarrassed if I treat him to dinner on the way home to my place. I buy dinner because I want to express my gratitude in picking me up and dropping me off safely at home. He never insists on entering my place, especially at night. 

There's also a wide age gap (43f and 64m) between us, which doesn't help clear up this awkward situation.

I've given him signals that I like him—jokes, initiating texts, telling him how much I like spending time with him, giving him things, being considerate, listening to him talk, etc. which he also gives me—but I'm not sure if he interprets these signals as flirting or romantic interest.

He also doesn't actively chase/pursue me or touch me. He offers his time, energy, and help, though.

I am not yet ready to ask about his intentions, because I am not yet ready to lose what we have now. But I know, I need to open the conversation soon because this confusion stresses me out and makes me anxious.

What should I do and how do I talk to him about this?

We've never brought up dating/romantic intentions in our conversations. He's single.

1osfodd,https://i.redd.it/xqdtsmwkg70g1.png,Fem decants review from whiff culture,"I wanted to buy a few ME fragrances so I got some decants first from whiff culture. Here are my first impressions.

**Khair pistachio 🥜☘️**: nice, soapy, nutty. Not very gourmand. I get a hint of good knight liquid but I get that smell from every pistachio perfume. If you like the pistachio note, get the plum oh so pistachio. They smell very similar. I haven't tried kayali pistachio gelato but this is supposedly a dupe of that. 3/5

**Lataffa angham🪻✨**: Man it is hyped for a reason. I loved this one. Very unique smell. Not a gourmand but not too fruity as well. I really liked it and it is a bang on dupe of burberry goddess. Makes you smell like a million bucks. I wouldn't recommend this for the younger crowd tho. I would definitely get the full size of this. 5/5

**Lataffa Victoria🍋💙**: freshly baked lemon cake. It dries down into a nice lemony vanilla. Dupe of d&g devotion but I would prefer the og to this. A good office scent for the corporate girlies. 4/5

**Khadlaj fursan white💮🥥**: this is a very jasmine forward scent. Smells like a garden of night blooming flowers in the evening. The dry down is very coconutty. I don't like this on me but I would like to smell this on a man. 3/5

**Lataffa Eclaire🍦🥛**: This is a really good gourmand. Instead of being vanilla forward, it is more lactonic and I believe that makes it better than the other gourmands out there. The opening is a bit chemically but once it settles down it smells heavenly. I think maceration will take care of that tho. Supposedly a dupe of Bianco latte. I'm definitely getting a full size of this. 4/5

**Khair confection🍭🍬**: I hate this. It doesnt smell like confectionery definitely. Burnt candy wrapper smell. Yuck. 0/5

**Khadlaj caffe latte☕🥯**: I love the scent. Kinda similar to eclair except this has a coffee note that I love. Opening is chemically but the dry down is really nice. The only down side is that it stains. Very noticeable stain. I'm still debating if I want to buy the full size or not. 4/5

I got all of these from whiff culture. They have surprisingly low price of decants. The delivery was smooth too. I will definitely order from them again. ",2,1762682678.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,2,1.0,False

1osfjkd,https://i.redd.it/ykbvjprqe70g1.png,Blemish Flaw - a psychological thriller worth looking at,"I’m going through a shiny new CDrama phase! I couldn't help but take a look at *Blemish Flaw* because it's from the same team behind that underrated costume drama Heroes. 

(By the way, watch *Heroes* if you can! Can I tempt you to watch it with Liu Yuning? Because he was in it. Anyway, I heard great things about it, and if it weren't for my distractible brain, I would have started it already, because the filming, atmosphere, and acting were so cinematic in the brief few minutes I looked.)

Anyway, I decided to watch a couple of episodes.

My first impression? It grabs you pretty quickly.

Story: Someone reminds Yang Zhenghui, who runs an online channel about true crime, about his ex-girlfriend Vivian, so he decides to look her up to see what she's been doing. To his surprise, he realizes that she has disappeared.

His amateur detective work leads him to ceramic artist Zeng Jie.

Thoughts: I initially thought this was a straightforward crime drama, but it’s more of a mind-bending, twisty drama full of unreliable narrators. Half the time, I’m not sure which version of the crime I'm watching or from whose perspective!

What I love about this drama is that you feel sure you know what happened to Vivian, but the next episode reveals more of the story from another perspective and completely changes the game. Blemish Flaw keeps you on your toes and constantly guessing as a result. I fully expect the show to reveal something about Zeng Jie that defies my expectations.

Because the story is being pieced together from different perspectives, and each person is an unreliable narrator, you never know what truth you're actually getting. Is a person's version pure fantasy, a lie, or the truth? The viewer has to figure it out, or maybe find some kind of truth between all the stories. That unique storytelling style is what I love.

I love the atmosphere, everyone's performances, and most of all, the fact that I can't guess what's going on. Right now, I'm convinced that everybody is guilty or manipulating each other.

I especially believe that Bai Xiaoling >!isn't as innocent as she seems. It's uncanny that she happens to know both the vlogger and his policeman friend—it feels like she's orchestrating something, even though it's shown in a way that makes it seem coincidental. Is Yang's coffee shop relationship with Bai a scheme of his... or is it Bai's scheme?? In this world, I don't believe in coincidences.!<

I almost feel sorry for Zeng Jie.>! Right now, it seems obvious that he's a villain, but is he, really? He's a lecher and a certifiable gold digger, but I also get the feeling he's the one being played and manipulated by various factions.!<

So, if you're looking for a quality psychological thriller, I definitely recommend it. If you've watched it, what do you think about it so far?",2,1762682184.0,CDrama,0,1.0,False
1osfije,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1osfije/best_upgrade_in_setup/,Best upgrade in setup,"I've just started getting into pour over. I've been drinking espresso for quite some time now (not that good at dialing it in, but I love the process of making coffee). 

I want to upgrade one thing in my setup to improve my pour over or get better at it more quickly. What would you recommend to improve first? 

Current setup:
Hario switch
Eureka Mignon turbo grinder
Cafec abaca filters
Still water from Spa bottles
Old pouring kettle with a big spout
Freshly roasted beans
Tiny scale from JoeFrex https://vanpommeren.nl/products/joefrex-digital-barista-scale-with-timer-weegschaal

I'm thinking about getting a timemore Fish electric kettle, a bigger scale to prevent wobbling when pouring, or a Kingrinder K6. 

Which of the above would give me the biggest improvement in learning/enjoying pour over? Or any other things I should do first? 

Budget is not that important. I'd prefer somewhere between €100-€150, but it's not a hard max.

My current pour overs have been nice, but a bit bland in taste. I guess that's mostly a skill problem. ",1,1762682075.0,pourover,1,1.0,False
1osfiit,https://i.redd.it/qbilvo4qe70g1.jpeg,"Building New Coffee Roastery - 10k Sq ft, Toffee Coffee Roasters","We are taking a big leap today!  
  
We are building a 10k sq ft warehouse from scratch to a coffee roastery, once again (once again, because we have done this before 2 times, may be small)  
  
We started in 2019, with a 400sq ft coffee shop from Bandra, Mumbai. There we had a local 5kg coffee roaster. The new place is roughly 25x of the small coffee shop. Though this is a backend roastery, the feeling is unreal.  
  
We expanded to another outlet in Phoenix Kurla, Mumbai and just after that lockdown happened. We shat our Phoenix outlet, continued roasting in Bandra, used to get freshly roasted coffees at our rented apartment in Powai and used to grind myself. I was very particular about both roasting and grinding the right way, which I feel many coffee companies end up underdo or overdo it.  
  
Though I had spent a decade in Mumbai, time was to let it go. Because we sensed we couldn't operate from here anymore. We flew to Bangalore, took a 3000 sqft (current place), build our roastery. Bangalore gave us wings to think large in terms of real estate. One reason was even that Karnataka grows 70% of India’s all produced coffee. So it was the place to set up. We have grew to over 10x since then served over 200,000+ coffee lovers.  
  
The idea for us for always to source directly from coffee estates from India/World, roast/blend and in many cases process it ourselves. Also build TCR from a full stack new age coffee perspective: From Single Origins to Speciality Blends to Barrel Aged to Microlots to Hot/Cold Brews, to Coffee Pods to Speciality Instant to South Indian Filter Coffee. Controlling supply chain gave us power to disrupt prices. Considering India has started drinking coffee, it is imperative that there is a large gap between premium coffees and mass options. It was always how TCR can get the best of the world of coffee to people at affordable prices and fill this gap.  
  
This 10k sqft place, would help us get the best cutting technologies in Speciality Coffee, have an inhouse RnD Coffee Lab to bring you new trends, maintain in consistency by measuring all variables. Just like Wine, unlocking right coffees is difficult because variables are too many: Region, Estate, Altitude, Variety, Varietals, Type, Moisture, Roast, First Crack Timing, Roast time, Cupping Taste etc. All of these are controllable today with the help of technology and Advanced Human Sensory.  
  
Would share our journey as we build this ground up.

I run a (very small still) small business in my free time and take care of all 3 kids by myself since i dont have family who live in the same state as me! I do all the cleaning, feeding our pets, school runs, household stuff, budgeting etc. 

My husband works until 4-5, comes home, eats and then chills on his phone and sleeps at the same time as my kids usually which leaves us to no quality time whatsoever. 

Now, usually on sundays we (as in me and the kids) love waking up with him and spending the whole day together. Sundays are for eating out and family fun day. Recently he has been going out with his friends for a coffee every single sunday morning and hanging out until noon. I told him i would like the sundays to have ours instead and he can go whenever he wants during the weekday when the kids are at sleep so after 7-7.30pm to see his friends and catch up. He is never bothered and says that sunday is better. Now thing that pisses me off is he tells me to feed all the kids and get them dressed and ready so when he comes home we can go out and still do something together. Im so tired of always dealing with the morning chaos alone. I LOVE going out for breakfast together and ive told him so many times. He says its not ” a big deal”. We had a huge fight over the same thing like always where i complain that he isnt present with us and always glued to his phone and we miss him but he says im just always looking a reason to fight. And that because he is usually home the whole weej after work thats his way of ”spending” time with us. 

AITAH for telling him that he should spend sunday with us? I get having some free time to see your friends and like I said he can do that in the evening anytime during the week i dont care. ",3,1762681984.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

This might be a bit out of left field, but I love thinking what kind of Pokémon characters would have. So I did it with all of the Helltaker Girls! I'll give some short explanations for each team, but some might be a stretch...

First: Pandemonica
Morpeko is for her attitude change when she drinks coffee
Dubwool and Snorlax are for her when she's tired/resemblance
Froslass and Gengar are for her sadisim
Gothitelle is for that hint of professionalism and elegance she has

Second: Modeus
Tinkaton is for her being cute and having a hammer lmao
Salazzle, Hatterene, and Gorebyss are for her Lust/Attractiveness but also the danger around her
Luvdisc is for her learning about romance
Gardevior is...well...y'know....but also because of her learning about romance which is why I also made it a mega since it looks like a wedding dress

Third: Cerberus
Call me shallow but I had to fill her team with dogs and those elemengs of mischievousness  with Zoroark, Grimmsnarl, and Mismagius

Fourth: Malina
Im actually super proud of this because of how it intertwine with Zdrada, but first. 
Bounsweet because of how her name is Raspberry in Polish
Aegislash because of Hero's 3 and her other RPG addictions
Sableye because she's a bit of a recluse 
Toxtricity Low Tune because of how it chugs water to suck out poision like how she chugs Vodka, buuut...also to match with 
Scovillian and Zangoose because they tend to fight with eachother or...their sworn natural enemies 

Fifth: Zdradaa
Weeding because of how much she smokes and Hisiuan Zoroark and Midnight Lycanroc because of ""Edgy Points"" but finally
Scovillian, Seviper, and High Amp Toxtricity to clash with or relate to Malina. Id like to think Scovillian is just the same Scovillian they both reluctantly share, each one has a favorite head

Sixth: Azazel/Loremaster

There is one overlap for later on, but theres good reason why! I wanted to sorta mix the teams of Azazel and Loremaster together to sort of show her fall
Togekiss: Angel
Absol: Falling Angel
Malamar: Fallen Angel (Plus because of how cartoonists villainous Loremaster is)
Otherwise I gave her Porygon Z, Silvally, and Genesect to tie her to her experiments and science

Seventh: Justice
Honestly, theres not too much thought in it lol, I just thought ""Hey, she'd want an awesome team of fighters."" Which is why I gave her so many, but Noivern and Lucario are also here to sort of match her blindness with Noivern being a bat and Lucario sensing Aura. Mega Lopunny is here for- Well...hot tomboy, but I also had to give her a pseudo legendary too! Maybe would've switched it with Garchomp though. Also, she'd of course get an Appletun later on in hindsight

Eigth: Lucifer

Of course I had to give her Pokémon Satan, Giritina! Seviper and Tsareena  are here to fill in those royal and serpent roles for Luci. But finally, I just had to make room for two of her central loves. Sweets and Small Animals...but...why have Cinccino...? Well...someone has to help her learn to clean when she becomes a maid...

Ninth: Judgement

As my best girl, I knew I had to do her justice. (Heh...puns)

Darkrai, Mega Gyrados, and Annihilape are here to match her shock and awe antics and having to look scary. 
Golisopod and Absol are also here for that but to also peak into her vulnerable side, with Golisopod having Emergency Exit and Absol being a warning of disaster instead of a bringer of it. This is the crossover I mentioned as well, with Azazel and Judgement both being fallen angels, I can see them both having Absol's. Finally, she of course has to have Growlithe because of her love for small animals and dogs

Tenth: Beelzebub. 

Now, I can admit when I'm a bit uncreative. But I couldn't help giving her two queen bee's, a bug type husk, and another strong bug type. Tyrantrum would be another connection to royalty with her being an ancient demon and going against Lucifer (presumably) and Spiritomb is of course for her punishment snd banishment into the abyss.

I’m 52F, and just went on coffee date yesterday as a first date. In his photos 54M was very attractive and when we met he looked like his photos but slightly older and slightly smaller. I think I’d built a picture in my head but am realising it’s hard to tell what people really look like from a few photos and I think I look better in my photos too! Anyway, he picked a lovely place for coffee, was really nicely dressed, attentive when sun was in my eyes offering to change seats, paid the bill etc, and wants to see me again. Sounds perfect right? But he never stopped talking about him for the whole time, didn’t really ask me any questions, I kinda couldn’t get a word in, so it’s put me off. I really get attracted to guys when we have great convo not sitting there having them talking at me solidly for over an hour. Maybe I’m doing something wrong not interjecting more, maybe he was nervous, I don’t know. This is only my second date ever in 20+ years so would appreciate some advice on should I give a second date a chance or call it quits? Thanks! Btw I would definitely go out with him again for a FWB situation if he could zip his talking but he told me he’s looking for a LTR and this is why his last ‘dating’ relationship ended.

1osf6q4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitedVitaminsGB/comments/1osf6q4/the_mitochondria_connection_the_place_where_your/,The Mitochondria Connection - The place where your Energy Starts (and Ends) in Your Cells,"A lot of clients told me  that they wake up tired, mostly rely on coffee to function properly, or have a crash by mid-afternoon. This might be a sign that  it’s more than “lack of sleep.”

Our energy is made at the cellular level, inside tiny engines called mitochondria. These engine are fully dependable on particular nutrients in order to function properly.

I have observed this both on me and my clients body: when  our mitochondrial ""engine"" optimises, brain fog becomes history, focus, energy, and even mood return naturally.

Energy and Focus

When your mitochondria ""Engines"" are under stress from unhealthy habits like processed or ultra processed foods, toxins, or nutrient deficiencies, your brain is the first to be affected.

Low levels of ATP (our cellular energy) result in slower thinking, poor motivation, and that “fog” feeling which no amount of caffeine fixes.

What helped me and many others: CoQ10, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and B-vitamin activated complexes.

They literally feed your mitochondria, helping cells produce clean energy instead of relying on stimulants.

Hormones & Recovery

Our adrenal glands and thyroid rely heavily on mitochondrial health.

When these are slowing down, we feel it: low motivation becomes present, the recovery is slower while the sleep becomes inconsistent.

Zinc, Magnesium, and Omega-3s are playing a vital role here and unfortunately most people I meet and live in the UK are low in them, especially through winter.

I’ve seen some strong improvements while these essential minerals are supplemented daily, Within a few weeks, the energy becomes more stable and mood less reactive.

Longevity and Inflammation 

Mitochondrian """"Engines"" also help regulating inflammation.

When they work properly, your body clears waste efficiently. When they don’t, inflammation rises leading to joint pains, aging skin and fatigue.

Antioxidants like Resveratrol, Alpha Lipoic Acid, and Glutathione support the body’s natural repair systems.

That’s why supplementing wisely isn’t “optional” anymore, it’s foundational health maintenance.

Quick Recommendations

	•	Support mitochondria with CoQ10, Acetyl-L-Carnitine, and PQQ

	•	Add Magnesium Bisglycinate or Threonate for energy and sleep

	•	Include Omega-3s only from trustworthy sources (I personally recommend more, rather than eating fish regularly due to high contamination of heavy metals, mercury, microplastics and other, this being a discussion that I want to approach soon, stay tuned if you would like to find out more about this subject)

	•	Reduce or remove seed oils and refined sugars from your diet, mitochondria hates them

	•	Stay hydrated and consider electrolytes if active or on low-carb diets

Final Thoughts

When your mitochondria thrive, everything feels easier — energy, focus, sleep, recovery, even mood.

If you’re constantly running on low power, it’s not laziness, it’s biology.
Start at the cellular level, and your whole system begins to respond.

so is there an actual connection between the language and Indonesia, or is it just a coincidence?

java's logo has a coffee cup
so is it named after Java coffee (which also comes from that island)?

1osezhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1osezhr/nosey_neighbor_thinks_im_cheating_on_my_husband/,Nosey neighbor thinks I’m cheating on my Husband,"My downstairs neighbor is an elderly woman who my husband and I have been friends with for the past few years. She gets to be pretty nosey sometimes but has never overstepped. I often cook for her, and she shares food with us sometimes too. 

Recently, my husband took a 10 day trip overseas. I’m often a hermit and also work from home — but since my husband is gone I’m trying to keep busy and go out more, meet up with friends. Every time I leave the apartment she makes sure to ask me where I’m going, what I’m doing etc— which at first I paid no mind because sometimes I’ll ask if she needs anything from the store or just make conversation. 

Last two instances I had to correct her that I was meeting up with only female friends. As I was passing her door having returned from coffee with one of my friends, I had my husband on speaker phone. She called me not long after and asked if I brought someone home with me. This question rubbed me the wrong way, and I said I already told her I was out hanging out with my girlfriends and that I would never do something like that. She said she heard a man’s voice and that it was loud. I explained it was my husband on speaker and that I was surprised she didn’t recognize him. She then backpedaled and tried to play it off like she was just curious if I was hanging out with a group of friends. Mind you, she’s never called to snoop before when I’ve had company over previously (probably because my husband was home too). 

Was she asking me all those questions on my previous outings because she was suspicious then? I felt conflicted — did she think so little of my character to jump to the conclusion that I would be unfaithful to my husband (whom I love very much). Even after the years where all I’ve shown her is kindness, a listening ear and home cooked meals. 

Perhaps I will start distancing myself from this neighbor if I realize she’s now looking for drama. I think she realizes this instance may have caused a rift and I’m also apprehensive how she will retaliate against me.

1oseyu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RichJam07/comments/1oseyu8/promoting_my_small_services_dm_if_interested/,"📢 Promoting my small services, dm if interested","Anyone can use AI nowadays, but mastering how to use it effectively is what truly makes a difference. It is also a skill that everyone needs.

**Why does it matter? Here are some common problems we face when using AI:**

• Having trouble getting results from AI

• Not achieving the outcome you hoped for

• Constantly switching between AI tools but still not getting what you want

• AI keeps repeating mistakes that never solves, leaving you frustrated

• Tired of dealing with AI and considering hiring someone expensive instead

This is where the skill really shines. With the right skill, most of the problems others face when using AI can be solved. Of course, not everything can be solved using AI, at least for now. I'm going straight to the point, I’m here to offer my small services using AI.

I’ve tried many ways to earn money for my rent: Writing and selling poetry e-books across marketplaces, building websites, creating Roblox experiences, and making Discord bots. Unfortunately, not everything worked out, and I ended up wasting my savings instead.

I also tried mining cryptocurrencies, taking part in surveys, using investment apps, and doing various online jobs, only to find that many were scams or ineffective. Yes, I learned these lessons the hard way and should have been more careful.

I have social disabilities and struggle with communication. I'm pessimistic, slow, and talentless. However, I believe it’s better to be honest about what I can do than to pretend I’m good at something I’m not.

Rather than cyberbegging, especially when there are people who need money more than I do, I’d rather offer small services or sell little things instead to earn money.

**I may not have many talents, but I could turn your ideas into something real, something you may be looking for.**

**Whether it’s:**

• Come up with a logo, branding, titles, or providing ideas and suggestions

• Revising sentences or words until you’re satisfied

• Writing short e-books or specific content

• Providing Roblox scripts or improving your Roblox game ideas

• Building Discord bot commands or a full Discord bot

• Adding HTML, CSS, or JS code to your website

• Giving design ideas for specific parts of your website

While it might take me a while to get things done, I put care into every project I do because every idea deserves to be realized and I'm also somewhat perfectionist.

I'm not into competition or comparing myself to others since I respect their skills, and also not trying to be professional while saying this:

**Why this service?**

People understood each other better than AI does mostly. If you ask someone who knows how to use AI skillfully, you’re more likely to get the results you want.

POSTING THIS FOR AWARENESS. Para wala na maloko tong taong to. Again, FOR AWARENESS. Wala na po sana victim shaming. Sino po ba gusto maloko diba? Wala naman po siguro. Kaya yung iba, they refuse to speak up pag naloko sila kasi sila ang sinisisi.
Please, be kind.

Never in a million years would I have thought that this would happen to me but shit happens. So everything started sa isang dating app (TNDR). Nag dating app ako mainly because nagbabaka sakali ako, I’ve heard na may success stories din naman so nag try ako. Then nakita ko tong taong to, JAMES ang name nya sa tndr acct nya.  Pagtingin ko sa acct niya (OO ALAM KO SASABIHIN NIYO - PANGET naman bakit pumatol? Hindi ko din alam!) He messaged and said if we could talk sa whatsapp since hindi daw siya lagi active sa tndr acct nya and 4days pa lang DAW siya dun. So I gave him my # and he called. When I heard his voice, ok naman. Pabiro ko pa nga sinabi sa friend ko “Naku! Maganda boses. Panget to. Haha.” He then asked if we could meet up for coffee, OFF AKO THAT DAY AND WALA NAMAN AKONG GANAP SOOO, pumayag ako. Sabi ko pa nga sa friend ko “para pag hndi kmi nag-click, hindi na tumagal convo. Wala na ako energy.” So nagkita kami and then we went to this coffee shop, “TINATANGI CAFE”. He asked kung ano daw order ko sabi ko kape lang since busog pa ako, after lunch ksi kami nag meet. Tapos nung magbabayad na, sabi nya he left his wallet sa car, will pay back later. Dun pa lang, nakakutob na ako pero hinayaan ko nlng. Kape pa lang naman. We stayed sa cafe a bit longer than expected kasi kwentuhan kami. Nagkwento sya sa past nya and all tpos I asked if he meron siyang FB acct. Sabi niya hindi siya active sa socials ksi nga may naninira sa kanya dun. Grabe daw paninira sa kanya na affected na daily life niya. “Crazy X GFs and mga naka match nya before na hindi nag end ng maayos ksi personally di nya daw gusto pero si girl daw wanted more so sinisiraan sya na manloloko daw eme eme.” Gusto ko na siya hanapin sa FB nun time na yun kasi gsto ko makita, kaso ung signal dun sobrang hina. May wifi pero loading lang. Tpos he insited na magkwentuhan nlng kami, mas ok daw marinig ko everything coming from him. He is saying all the right things. He is so good with words. Tapos the way siya makipag usap, talagang tinitignan ka niya sa mata. Extra sweet, extra caring. Madadala ka talaga. Sabi ko pa nga “THIS IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE”. May kutob na ako na di maganda, pero hinayaan ko lang. He then invited me to his place, malapit lang daw. Nabili daw nya yun pero he only stays there on the weekends kasi dun siya sa kapatid niya nagsstay sa QC dahil andun work niya. Ipapakilala daw niya ako sa mom niya. Tpos nagpunta na nga kami sa “bahay” niya and he introduced me to his mom. Sobrang welcoming pa nga ni mother, nagluto pa meryenda. Tpos nakita ko ung “SHOE COLLECTION” niya. Sabi ko pa nga ang dami ah! Ung iba daw dun matagal na, tinatago lang nya ksi nga collectors item daw. Hindi na kmi nagtagal sa bahay kasi dinala nya pa ako sa “GLASS HOUSE” para daw ma-pasyal naman niya ako and ganda daw vibes dun, first time daw niya dun and matagal na niya gusto puntahan. Tapos nag dinner kmi. He offered to pay for our dinner. Kwentuhan lang kami hanggang sa nag aya na ako umuwi. Binaba ko siya sa sakayan bus kasi uuwi daw sya ng QC.
Tpos kinabukasan, may inasikaso ako. Nung pagtingin ko ng wallet ko ksi may babayaran ako, nakita ko na nawawalan ako ng pera (₱3600). Dun na ako parang natulala tapos pilit kong inisip kung ano ngyari the day before.
Prior kami magkita ni “JAMES”. Nagpagas ako and nakita ko pa dun cash ko. I used my card pang gas. Tpos sa coffee naman, may nakahiwalay ako na cash sa coin purse ko so aun ang ginamit ko. Tpos sa dinner, siya naman nagbayad and hindi ko na dala bag ko nun since sabi nya he will be paying for dinner. Naalala ko dun sa tinatangi cafe nag CR ako and iniwan ko bag ko sa kanya. Malay ko bang nanakawan ako. I confronted him sa chat tpos sabi lang niya “Baka na misplace mo.” Tapos parang wala lang sa knya.

That’s when I decided to search him sa FB and may nakita akong post regarding sa kanya (attached photo dito) tpos nag msg ako dun sa nag post and dun ko na nalaman ung MO nya and years na niyang ginagawa ito. 
Madami kaming girls ang sabay sabay niyang kinakausap and lahat sa dating app lang niya nakilala. Viber/Whatsapp ang gamit nya para makpg usap. LOVE ang tawag niya samin lahat siguro para hindi siya malito. Majority of us, dinala niya diyan sa TINATANGI CAFE and sa GLASS HOUSE. Sa ibang girls na matagal na niya nakakausap, after ilang days daw ng usap nila nagsstart na siya magsabi na “Love short ako. Wala pa sahod. Sira paymaya ko. Floating pa ung transfer ko. Bawi ako sayo sa sahod. Nagugutom na ako love, dipa ako kumakain since kahapon. Wala ako pamasahe papnta work (FYI: wala siya work). Tight lang daw ngayon sa budget kasi sole caretaker ng nanay niya. Siya sagot sa meds ng nanay niya. Malala ung nagsasabi siya na-ospital/namatayan siya kamag-anak.” (FYI: BROKE B*TCH tong si Jack at walang trabaho. Ang sabi niyang work niya eh Field Operation Supervisor, yun pala taga palit lng ng gulong sa servitek nung pandemic pa. Palamunin lang ng nanay niya ngayon at namamalimos sa mga babae niya para lang may pangkain. Tapos halos lahat pala ng babae niya dinala niya dun sa bahay nila (hindi pala sa kanya, sa pamangkin nya) pinapakilala niya sa nanay niya. Ibat ibang babae. Meron pa iba sa umaga, iba sa gabi. To the point nga na nakikipag kita siya at hindi na nakakapag palit ng clothes dahil sobrang hectic sched nya sa pakikipag meet. Kinukunsinti ng nanay niya ung pagdadala nya iba iba babae sa bahay. Tpos ung mga sapatos niya? Lahat un pinapabili niya sa mga naging babae nya. Sasabihin niya malapit na bday niya (Every month na lang bday niya). From different places mga girls nya. Paano ko nalaman lahat? MADAMI AKO NAKAUSAP NA MGA NAGING BIKTIMA NIYA and we exchanged photos and screenshots. Di lang ako nag-iisa. MADAMI KAMI. Thankful pa din ako na once lang kmi nag meet at hindi na humaba, kinabukasan nalaman ko din lahat. He even denied it and sabi sinisiraan lang daw siya and wag daw ako maniwala and paborito niyang line saming lahat - “LET’S WORK THIS OUT LOVE. Wag ka sana papa apekto sa mga naninira sakin.”
Masyado na mahaba to, diko na madetalye lahat. If isa ka sa mga nabiktima nya, you can message me for questions. 

AND NOW HE IS ATTACKING YUNG ISA SAMIN. Siguro wala na siya mabiktima sa tndr at wala na siya pangkain kaya iba na atake gingawa niya. Some of us made posts kasi to spread awareness regarding JACKZON LAGARAS COLEGADO AKA JAMES (on TNDR) para wala na siya mabiktima pa na iba. Si satanas nga mismo nahihiya na sa ginagawa niya. There are posts in other soc.med regarding him, search niyo lang name niya.
Tapos he made a post dito sa reddit but it was removed by the mod (Thankyou!) tapos lumipat na siya sa FB. He made a fake profile on FB under the name JHEMA REYES and nagpost ng kasinungalingan online para ipahiya yung girl. 
If ever makita niyo yung post, be kind dun sa girl na naka post and just report ung post. Managot dapat ung managot. If ever tatanungin niyo bakit hindi namin ireklamo? Meron na pending and brgy blotter sa kanya. 
Kaso welcome to the Philippines. Not enough claims to put behind bars.
Just please, ladies. Wag kayo papaloko, lalo na sa JACKZON COLEGADO na to. Panget na nga, hindi pa naging mabait.",4,1762679664.0,ScammersPH,1,1.0,False

1osev7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1osev7p/secret_how_im_flipping_walmart_clearance_items/,**SECRET:** How I'm Flipping Walmart Clearance Items for $500+ PROFIT EACH [Retail Arbitrage] (FBA Goldmine!),"Hey MaximizeMe fam!

Alright, so I know the title sounds a bit like clickbait, but hear me out. I've been dabbling in retail arbitrage for a while now, mostly smaller flips, but recently I stumbled onto something at Walmart that completely changed my game. We're talking about finding *single items* on clearance that net $500+ profit. No joke. It feels like cracking a secret code sometimes, and frankly, I felt like this community needed to know about it.

This isn't your grandma's coupon clipping, folks. We're talking about a focused strategy that leverages deep discounts on specific items, usually larger ticket ones, and then flipping them on Amazon FBA. Why Walmart? Because their clearance can be ridiculously inconsistent from store to store, leading to some truly overlooked gems.

So, how do you even sniff out these kinds of profits? It's not about clearance socks, trust me.

Here's the gist of what I've learned, and what makes these $500+ flips possible:

*   **Think Big, Not Small:** Forget the $5 items. We're looking for electronics (older models, sometimes even display units), small appliances (robot vacuums, high-end coffee makers), home goods, power tools, or even seasonal patio furniture way out of season. These are items that *can* have a higher initial price point, so a 70-90% discount translates into serious profit margin.
*   **The Hidden Tags (or Lack Thereof):** Sometimes the best clearance isn't clearly marked. Look for items with yellow tags that are significantly lower than the shelf price, or even items in the ""clearance aisle"" that have been sitting for ages. Sometimes the sticker price is *wrong* and it scans for much less. Always, always scan!
*   **Your Secret Weapon: Scanner Apps:** This is non-negotiable. I use the Amazon Seller app in conjunction with Keepa.
    *   **Amazon Seller App:** Scan the UPC barcode. It'll show you the current Amazon price, estimated fees, and your potential profit *if* you bought it at the Walmart price. This is your initial filter.
    *   **Keepa:** This is where you separate the good deals from the *great* deals. Check the historical sales rank and price data. Did it used to sell for much higher? Is there consistent demand? You don't want to buy something that's only selling for $5 more than you paid, even if it's a big item, if it's gonna sit in FBA for months. We're looking for velocity *and* profit.
*   **FBA is Your Best Friend:** For these larger, higher-value items, FBA (Fulfillment by Amazon) is a game-changer. You ship it to Amazon, they store it, pick it, pack it, and handle customer service. This is key because storing a bunch of robot vacuums in your garage isn't ideal, and handling shipping for big boxes is a pain. Plus, customers trust FBA.
*   **Patience & Persistence:** You won't find a $500+ flip every time you walk into Walmart. Sometimes you strike out. Other times, you hit the jackpot. It’s about consistency and knowing what to look for. And yes, sometimes it means driving to a few different Walmarts in a day. Think of it as treasure hunting.

Honestly, if you're serious about taking a crack at this, or just want to see the detailed breakdowns of how folks are consistently hitting those big numbers, there's a killer resource out there that dives *super* deep into the exact strategies – from what apps to use, to negotiating clearance prices (yep, it's a thing!), and even how to handle shipping these bigger items to Amazon efficiently. I found it incredibly helpful myself, and it covers pretty much everything you need to know to get started. You can find it right here: [https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals](https://whop.com/emoney/?a=liveitupdeals)

It's truly wild what you can find once you know what to look for. It really feels like finding money on the street sometimes. Has anyone else had similar experiences with big clearance flips, either at Walmart or elsewhere? What are your go-to items or scanning tips? I'm always keen to hear different strategies!",1,1762679590.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

A bit about me: I enjoy books, music, long walks, and trying out new cuisines. I'm emotionally mature, respectful, and value genuine connections. Ideally, I'm looking to meet someone  who shares similar interests and is open to building a friendship that could grow into something deeper.

Built a free quiz that basically tells people:

Because we all know the truth:
- $400 machine + $50 grinder = disappointing espresso
- $200 machine + $300 grinder = actually good espresso

The quiz walks people through:
- Their actual budget (not wishful thinking)
- Current grinder situation (this is where reality hits)
- Time commitment (manual vs electric)
- Whether they should even START with espresso (hot take: most shouldn't)

Pros:
- Maayos at accommodating ang customer service.
- Maganda ang ambiance. Cozy, tahimik, at relaxing.

Cons:
- Medyo overpriced for what you actually get.
- Food taste is just okay, not really sulit for the price. I ordered the tuna sandwich (₱220) na parang tinipid sa tuna, and the churro waffles (₱200) which were just average.
- Drinks were underwhelming. I had the tablea chocolate (₱180, non-coffee) and it came out a bit grainy, with some powder not fully dissolved. Parang hindi masyadong hinalo or natunaw nang maayos. My companion had the Spanish latte (₱180) and it was just okay din, nothing special for the price.
- Mainit sa second floor kahit may aircon. Less than 10 lang kami that time, and when we were the last two left, they turned off the electric fan. Sayang kasi kahit mahina lang yung hangin, nakakatulong naman siya sa aircon.
- No Wi-Fi, at mahina pa signal ng mobile data sa area. Gets ko naman na di lahat ng café may Wi-Fi, pero sana they consider offering it lalo na kung hindi reliable ang signal.
- No available sockets, so definitely not a good spot for remote work or studying.

Just for comparison: Mas sulit pa nga yung ham and cheese sandwich sa BreadTalk na nasa mga ₱70 lang, considering both price and taste (so good btw, a must-buy).

Overall, it’s a nice place if gusto mo lang mag-chill saglit or catch up with friends, but for me, not something I’d go back to regularly, especially if you’re after value-for-money food, good drinks, or a café you can actually work in.",3,1762678916.0,casualbataan,4,1.0,False

We don't work together; he's from another company. We exchanged numbers and sent each other small gifts. He started texting me memes, random stuff about his life. Then, after texting for months, I asked him if he wanted to have coffee with me to get to know him more. He said yes and after our coffee meetup, he insisted on driving me home. His place is almost two hours away from my place since we live in opposite directions. He started offering to drive me to work and school where I am taking my masters, insisting on fetching me, one to two times a week. I offered to meet him halfway, but he didn't want me to commute long distance. We have lunches and dinners. He'd give thoughtful gifts, nothing expensive. We talk nonstop about mundane things whenever we meet.

I really like him, but he's never flirted with me or broken the touch barrier, so I'm not sure if he likes me. He also gets embarrassed if I treat him to dinner on the way home to my place. I buy dinner because I want to express my gratitude in picking me up and dropping me off safely at home. 

There's also a wide age gap (43f and 64m) between us, which doesn't help clear up this awkward situation.

I've given him signals that I like him—jokes, initiating texts, telling him how much I like spending time with him, giving him things, being considerate, listening to him talk, etc.—but I'm not sure if he knows understands these signals. 

One time, he came to fetch me and he hadn't had lunch yet so I offered lunch—I didn't really mind cooking because I always cook for my parents—then he got quiet and aloof. The next time we met, he said I didnt have to prepare anything for lunch or give him things.

During our first coffee meetup, he also didnt want to have something to eat with me. So I'm really confused if he's interested at all or he is just an overall nice person. I bought us some simple food and paid for everything because I was the one who invited him.

He also doesn't actively chase/pursue me. He offers his time, energy, and help, though.

I am not yet ready to ask about his intentions, because I am not yet ready to lose what we have now. But I know, I need to open the conversation soon because this confusion stresses me out and makes me anxious.

What should I do and how do I talk to him about this?

1osen9q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1osen9q,Pine Corridors and Mirror Ponds,"There are places you return to with no plans — simply because you know they’ll be beautiful.

The abandoned quarries not far from my home are one of those places. In autumn, they’re especially magical: pines reflect in the crisp air, birches lean toward the water, and the silence grows thicker — almost tangible.

The path there runs through straight rows of pines — a neat, almost geometric forest where light breaks into stripes, and the fatbike tires whisper softly over a carpet of needles.

No matter what I do, where I am, or the situation, I'm constantly terrified of everyone around me. I can't even breathe without feeling like I have someone watching my every single move and judging it. I see other trans ppl being openly themselves, not being ashamed of who they are and they just seem so confident. I see other therians wearing gear and doing quadratics in public and just being unapologetically themselves, and they seem so brave. I see other people dressing alt and cool and being confident like that. Honestly, as absolutely amazing as all those types of ppl are and I'm so happy for them that they're expressing themselves, I can't help but feel so goddamn jealous.

I can't even draw on my shoes without feeling heavily judged, I have a small pride flag up in my locker and I don't even open my locker all the way unless the hallways pretty much empty. I literally can't even go to my local coffee shop and order myself something without absolutely internally losing my mind. I can't even come out as trans to my goddamn friends without worrying (I'm a stealth transmasc person) and honestly? It's fucking exhausting. I can't function, let alone actually enjoy myself and live a normal life. My Dad doesn't believe I have social anxiety, even though I'm diagnosed with it, and honestly I find it infuriating. It effects me in so many ways and noone even cares enough to validate me. And even the ppl who do believe me and support me, I can't talk about it with them without worrying they'll think im faking it.

One of the worst parts though, is how it's started effecting me online. Reddit and discord used to be safe spaces for me, but now I'm too scared everyone on there judges me to even post/say anything most of the time. I feel guilty because I know I'm distancing myself from the world more and more and that im just creating my own hell at the end of the day. But honestly I can't deal with anything anymore. My anxiety is getting worse, I know it is. My meds don't even work in the slightest. I have nothing anymore because of my social anxiety, and I'm loosing my life.

Men, if you really want to tell her you love her do this:  
  
A warm bath with lavender, eucalyptus, or her favorite fragrance to set the mood. Candles, a plush robe fresh and warm from the dryer and cozy slippers.  Doing her nails.  File, and paint with her favorite color. Brush her hair, whether it’s a braid, or something cute (ponytail, pigtails?). One of those face masks you get at walmart , CVS, or Ulta. Her favorite tea, coffee,  a  smoothie, BOBA even! A warm cookie, a brownie or fruit. A stash of her favorite snacks or drinks,  ""because SHE is special”.  Make it a ""Spa night"".  How about a full massage? Back, feet, legs, neck, and head massage.    Read to her (a book or better yet something you wrote for her), or just sit and talk! No phones just your undivided attention. As for other activities: Legos, coloring, games, video games, a fun love app on the playstore, or apple store, anything that makes HER happy.  
  
Don't overdo it, and you don't have to do all of this.  Hell make your own list! Find out what she likes , and file that info away for later.  Don't be a simp or a clingy jerk, but every now and then remind her why you are the PRIZE.  
  
ladies don't take that the wrong way!  
If your man is willing to do this stuff now and then, leads with character,  is willing to fight for you, is a good dad (IF y'all have kids) and puts it down in the Bed, you have found a good one!  Being thoughtful does not mean being a chump or a simp or a doormat.  It makes you a rare gem, and any princess/ queen who has ever dealt with a useless asshole will more than likely recognize that you are special and a GREAT man.

We built a context-engineered prompt that acts like a co-author, editor, and researcher all in one, and we’re giving it away for free. Please share your remarks in the comments — we’ll revert soon with the next version. We hope this helps save a lot of time for hardworking prompt engineers and writers.



    // START OF PROMPT //
    INTELLIGENT CONTEXT ENGINE: CO-AUTHOR PROTOCOL v3.0
    /* Created by https://www.reddit.com/r/ceprompts/ */
    // LAYER 1: CORE IDENTITY & MISSION //
    Primary Directive: You are my intelligent, professional co-author—an AI collaborator embodying the roles of developmental editor, researcher, ghostwriter, and creative partner. Your mission is to partner with me in crafting a compelling, well-structured, publication-ready mini-book of approximately 50,000 words (roughly 200 pages in standard formatting). This collaboration will be iterative, responsive, and focused on quality, ensuring the final product is engaging, insightful, and polished for readers.
    Book Project Placeholder: [Insert your book's working title and a one-sentence logline here. Example: ""Title: 'The Quantum Garden.' Logline: An exploration of how quantum mechanics principles can be applied to everyday problem-solving and personal growth.""]
    (Note: Replace this placeholder with your specific project details before using the prompt. This ensures the AI tailors its responses precisely to your vision.)
    // LAYER 2: STRUCTURAL BLUEPRINT //
    We will construct the book using this robust architectural framework. To confirm understanding, please summarize this structure back to me in your initial response.
    Total Length Target: 50,000 words (flexible by ±10% to allow for natural flow).
    Format: 10 Chapters, plus an Introduction and Conclusion.
    Chapter Length: Approximately 5,000 words per chapter (about 20 pages at 250 words/page).
    Chapter Structure: Each chapter must include:
    An engaging opening hook (e.g., a question, anecdote, or provocative statement to draw readers in).
    3-4 core concepts or sub-sections, each with clear, descriptive headings.
    Illustrative examples, data, anecdotes, or case studies for each concept (sourced from research where needed to add credibility).
    A concise summary or transitional hook to seamlessly lead into the next chapter.
    Additional Elements:
    Introduction: ~2,000 words, setting the stage, outlining the book's thesis, and previewing key themes.
    Conclusion: ~2,000 words, synthesizing insights, offering final takeaways, and inspiring action.
    Appendices (optional): For references, glossaries, or further reading if the topic demands it.
    Target Audience: [Describe your ideal reader in detail. Example: ""Curious professionals aged 25-45 without a scientific background, seeking practical insights for personal and career growth.""] (Pro Tip: Defining the audience helps tailor language, examples, and depth—e.g., avoid jargon for beginners or dive deeper for experts.)
    // LAYER 3: VOICE & STYLE MODULATION //
    Consistency in voice is paramount for an immersive reading experience. Analyze the provided author examples and synthesize a unique, blended voice that matches the specified traits. This ensures authenticity and engagement across the entire book.
    Desired Voice Traits: [Select 3-5 adjectives that define the tone. Example: ""Witty, accessible, authoritative, slightly irreverent, and empathetic.""] (Customize this to fit your project's vibe—e.g., add ""inspirational"" for motivational books or ""analytical"" for technical ones.)
    Authorial Examples for Synthesis:
    Clarity & Analogy (Malcolm Gladwell Influence): Master the art of simplifying complex ideas through interconnected stories, analogies, and ""aha"" moments that make abstract concepts feel intuitive and relatable.
    Narrative & Depth (Oliver Sacks Influence): Infuse lyrical storytelling with profound human insights, turning scientific or technical topics into emotionally resonant narratives that highlight real-world impacts.
    Punch & Engagement (Ryan Holiday Influence): Deliver concise, bold, actionable prose with a modern edge—direct, motivational, and free of fluff to keep readers hooked and empowered.
    Overall Tone: [Describe the feel. Example: ""Conversational yet informative, like a brilliant friend sharing fascinating insights over coffee—warm, engaging, and thought-provoking without being condescending.""]
    Pacing: [Specify rhythm. Example: ""Deliberate and varied: Build tension in hooks, accelerate through examples, and pause for reflection in summaries to maintain momentum and prevent fatigue.""]
    Style Guidelines:
    Use active voice predominantly for energy.
    Vary sentence length for rhythm (mix short, punchy sentences with longer, descriptive ones).
    Incorporate rhetorical questions, metaphors, and subtle humor where appropriate.
    Ensure inclusivity: Use gender-neutral language and diverse examples.
    Word Choice: Precise, evocative, and audience-appropriate—avoid overly academic terms unless explained.
    // LAYER 4: EXECUTION PROTOCOL //
    Our collaboration follows a sequential, feedback-driven workflow to build iteratively and avoid rework. Do not advance phases without explicit approval. Acknowledge your full understanding of this protocol in your response.
    Phase 1: Brainstorming & TOC Finalization:
    Discuss and refine core ideas for the book's overarching theme and each of the 10 chapters.
    Generate a detailed Table of Contents (TOC) in bullet-point format, including chapter titles, brief descriptions (1-2 sentences each), and key sub-sections.
    Iterate on the TOC based on my feedback until I approve it. We won't proceed to drafting without this lock-in.
    Phase 2: Chapter Drafting:
    Tackle one chapter at a time, starting with Chapter 1.
    For each chapter: First, provide a detailed Outline expanding on the TOC entry, including the hook, 3-4 sub-sections with bullet-point breakdowns, examples/ideas, and summary/transition.
    Upon outline approval, draft the chapter one sub-section at a time (e.g., Hook first, then Sub-section 1, etc.).
    Pause after each sub-section for my review and feedback. This modular approach ensures alignment on voice, content, and flow.
    Phase 3: In-Line Collaboration & Revisions:
    Respond to my feedback using simple tags for clarity, such as:
    [MORE: ""Elaborate on this quantum entanglement analogy with a real-life relationship example.""]
    [EXAMPLE: ""Add a historical anecdote about Schrödinger here.""]
    [VOICE: ""Make this section more irreverent, like Holiday's stoic punch.""]
    [REPHRASE: ""This sentence feels clunky—smooth it out for better flow.""]
    [RESEARCH: ""Verify this claim with 2-3 credible sources.""]
    Implement changes directly in revised text, highlighting updates (e.g., via bold for new additions or strikethrough for deletions) to make iterations transparent.
    If research is needed, cite sources inline (e.g., [Source: Book/Journal, Year]) and suggest expansions.
    Phase 5: Review, Polish & Consolidation (Note: Renumbered for logical flow; includes global edits):
    After all chapters are drafted, perform a full-book review for continuity, pacing, redundancies, and thematic coherence.
    Draft the Introduction and Conclusion last, ensuring they bookend the content perfectly (Introduction: Hook + Thesis + Preview; Conclusion: Synthesis + Takeaways + Call to Action).
    Final Polish: Check for grammar, consistency, word count, and reader engagement. Suggest cuts or expansions as needed.
    Output the complete manuscript in a clean, formatted document (e.g., Markdown with headings) upon completion.
    // LAYER 5: ENHANCEMENTS FOR UNIVERSAL AI COMPATIBILITY & BEST PRACTICES //
    AI-Agnostic Design: This protocol is optimized for models like GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and others—focus on clear, sequential instructions to minimize hallucinations or off-track responses.
    Research Integration: When drafting, proactively suggest or incorporate verified facts, data, or quotes. Use your knowledge cutoff or built-in tools (if available) for accuracy; flag any uncertainties for my input.
    Word Count Tracking: In each draft segment, include a running word count (e.g., ""Sub-section Word Count: 1,200 / Chapter Total So Far: 3,500"").
    Ethical Guardrails: Ensure all content is original, respectful, and free of bias. If sensitive topics arise, discuss handling with me.
    Creativity Boost: Feel free to propose innovative ideas, twists, or visuals (e.g., ""Consider adding a diagram here for clarity""), but only implement upon approval.
    Termination/Reset: If needed, I can say ""Reset Protocol"" to restart or adjust layers.
    // INITIATION SEQUENCE //
    To activate this Context Engine and begin collaboration, respond with:
    Acknowledge your role as my co-author and restate the book's mission based on the provided project placeholder.
    Paraphrase the Structural Blueprint (including word count, chapters, and elements) to confirm alignment.
    Describe the synthesized authorial voice in your own words, drawing from the examples and traits.
    Affirm your readiness to start with Phase 1: Brainstorming & TOC Finalization.
    Offer 3-5 compelling, creative ideas for Chapter 1, tailored to the book's logline, to kickstart ideation.
    This protocol transforms AI into a powerhouse writing partner—let's create something extraordinary!

They were eager, very conversational, we bonded, I realise I traumabonded a little and felt special by how eager they were. We met and hit it off were solid for a year before I started uni. 

Bit of a backstory before we get into the uni days when it started to go downhill, they used games likes ”2 truths and one lies” and it turns out, they copypasted that with every person they talked with - me and people they met on tinder. Sometimes even had chat gbt open. They also drank a lot of alcohol and loads of the meeting were us drinking wine. They also jokes that people, like their tinder dates had to be manipulated and some girl accused them of gaslighting.

Then uni started and we were talking daily, convos were complains about our lives and both were exhausting. Once uni started and I began making new friends I could sense the difference. They became short with answers, could sense they were mad. Then I asked and they just blew off. I was the problems, just really bashing me, doesn’t wanna text so much etc. They only said they were sorry how it came out but blamed me for how they acted because I responded so quickly so they didn’t have time to calm down.

Things calm down and the rules they set got forgotten by them. They’d text me loads knowing I was busy, then when they were with people it was silence for the whole weekend. I’d get an occasinal snap to keep the streak, they’d tell me about their dates and I’d have to reply yet get a response maybe 2 days later. Felt weird, a bit surface level - why the need to keep the streak when we can just talk when it’s convinient for both.

Then I just didn’t have time for it all anymore. I was studying, texting all the time started to be exhausting. They’d complain if I wasn’t commenting enough but their style of talking was giving me a 3min talk about their life rather than an actual conversation. Always when I wanted to tell them something it was more of an opener for me to then talk about their life. I just couldn’t juggle it, convos felt more like diary dumps.

Last straw was when I said one of my friends was exhausting me and they said they know what it feels like, as in I was that for them. And again I was the whole problem, just me. We decided to take a break.

After a few months I texted them, they were super eager to meet me again. We met. I asked them out for coffee another time too. Then planned a new meeting but cancelled and tried to plan another but I got other plans. I even said I was sorry for the fight, they just thanked me.

During this they clearly didn’t wanna text me anymore, short answers when they got out what they needed to say. So I put on mutual effort, got a text during my studies, didn’t have time so I answered shortly. The last meeting I tried to plan I got a text of what they were up to, rather than just ”yes” they rather tell me what they are doing and then 1h later say ”yes” and instantly wanted a wine night but I suggested a coffee shop and they sorta seemed dissapointed. They also forgot my birthday during this period.

Then when the date wasn’t set after a week I got other plans on the dates I had suggested and I informed them, they just sorta were then eager to meet and wanted to set the date but I had already said those dates rn don’t work. I suggested they could suggest a date (not mentioning it’s now all been me) and they said I am busier, I should. Jusy the normal ”oh lets hang” suggestion where they won’t actually make any effort towards it. They said that weekday night are fine, weekends they don’t know about, but I just didn’t see the spark anymore, didn’t feel it. I didn’t wanna go drink on weekdays, nor do I drink at all now. So I said weekends work better for me, that he should tell me when he knows what weekends work, he said sure. I deleted his number. 

I didn’t wanna be the one who makes the effort. So I made sure I wouldn’t. And I don’t think I’ll get his number back as he’d need to text me. And I don’t see that happening. He probably is mad again, waiting for me to. And i guess I feel good, didn’t feel the need to over explain, and refuced to accept this. Feels calm.",2,1762677718.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

1osecme,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1osecme/need_help_choosing_between_a_south_indian_coffee/,Need help choosing between a South Indian Coffee Filter and AGARO Manual Press.,"Hey everyone,  
I’m a 20-year-old student living in a hostel, and I’ve recently started exploring *real* coffee after years of drinking instant/chicory stuff (which honestly just tastes bitter and fake). I finally want to taste actual coffee... the aroma, flavor notes, all of it... but I’m also on a super tight budget.

Here’s my setup and situation:

* I **only have access to hot water** (no stove, no fancy machine).
* I recently got interested in Blue Tokai coffees and am planning to order a **3 × 75g beginner’s tasting pack...** Attikan Estate, Kalledevarapura, and Baarbara Estate.
* I was planning to brew with a **South Indian coffee filter** since it’s affordable (₹250–350) and uses the right grind size (\~710 μm).
* But then I saw the **AGARO Regency Manual Press Coffee Maker** on Amazon (\~₹1000–1800, comes with 500 paper filters + metal filter). It’s basically a budget AeroPress clone and looks super hostel-friendly.

Now I’m kind of torn. I want good taste and less bitterness, but I also can’t spend too much on coffee gear right now.  
Here’s what I’ve figured out so far (based on a lot of reading and advice from pinned posts here):

* The **South Indian filter** is cheaper, gives that rich decoction that works great with milk, and lets me reuse the grounds once (Indian-style frugality 😅). From 225g total coffee, I can get around **25 mugs** if I reuse smartly.
* The **Agaro manual press** gives cleaner, less bitter coffee and is more flexible (can make Americano-style, black coffee, etc.), but uses more coffee per cup (around 15g) and you can’t really reuse the grounds.... so it’ll make **15–18 mugs max** from 225g.

My current thought process:

* I’ll probably start with the **South Indian filter**, since it’s cheaper, suits my current grind, and I can stretch the beans more.
* Once I learn what kind of coffee flavors I like (chocolatey, nutty, fruity, etc.), I’ll think about getting a **manual press (Agaro or AeroPress)** later when I can afford it.

But before I pull the trigger, I’d love some **real feedback from you all**:  
👉 Is the AGARO Regency actually worth it for someone like me, or should I just stick with the classic filter for now? Coz I don't have 5k to spend on an original Aeropress.  
👉 Anyone here tried both and can compare the taste difference or long-term cost?  
👉 Any hostel hacks to get the most out of coffee grounds (without ruining the taste)?

Thanks in advance! I’m honestly just trying to get into *real coffee* without breaking my wallet 😅  
Would love to hear what you all think.



**TL;DR:**  
Broke 20-year-old hostel student, only has hot water access. Choosing between South Indian coffee filter (₹300) and AGARO manual press (₹1000–1800). Want good taste, low bitterness, but also maximum value for money. Which one should I get first?",3,1762677655.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.81,False

Standing in a crowded Bangkok market, sweating through my shirt, I watched a perfect candid moment unfold—an elderly vendor laughing with a customer, light streaming through the awning. I swung my massive backpack off my shoulders, fumbled with the back-panel zipper, dug past my water bottle and jacket, and finally extracted my camera just in time to see them walk away.

That's when it hit me. The ""best camera bag"" everyone raved about online wasn't the best for *me*. It was perfect for landscape photographers hiking into the mountains with a full kit. But for street photography in humid cities? It was overkill wrapped in frustration.

Here's what two years of testing different bags taught me: **there's no single best camera bag—only the best bag for how YOU shoot**. The wildlife photographer needs something completely different than the wedding shooter. The weekend hobbyist has different priorities than the traveling content creator.

After testing 15+ bags across various shooting styles and lugging camera gear through 12 countries, I've figured out which bags actually deliver on their promises. Let me save you from my mistakes.

# 1. Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L V2 – Best Overall Versatility

**Price:** \~$280 | **Best For:** Photographers who need one bag for everything

This bag keeps showing up in ""best of"" lists for a reason—it genuinely works for multiple photography styles without major compromises.

The Everyday Backpack earned its spot in my rotation during a chaotic week shooting both a corporate event and mountain landscapes in Colorado. Same bag, completely different gear configurations, zero complaints. The FlexFold dividers let me shift from ""two camera bodies plus five lenses"" to ""one camera, laptop, and weekend clothes"" in under three minutes.

What actually impressed me was the **dual side access**. You can grab your camera through either side panel without removing the bag—a game-changer when you're navigating crowded airports or stalking wildlife on a trail. The MagLatch closure system looks gimmicky until you're wearing gloves in 20-degree weather and realize you can open it one-handed.

**The honest downsides:** At 3.5 pounds empty, it's not the lightest option. And those side-access panels? They don't stay as organized as Peak Design's marketing suggests if you pack soft items like jackets in the top compartment. Things shift around.

**Real-world capacity:** One mirrorless body with 70-200mm attached, three additional lenses, laptop up to 16 inches, and still room for a light jacket or packable rain shell.

The bag's made from 100% recycled materials, which matters if sustainability factors into your buying decisions. After 18 months of regular use, mine shows zero signs of wear—the weatherproof coating still shrugs off rain like the day I bought it.

**Who should skip it:** If you're primarily a street photographer who needs lightning-fast access, this bag's multiple zippers and panels slow you down. Look at a sling instead.

# 2. Bellroy Venture Sling 10L Camera Edition – Best for Street Photography

**Price:** \~$169 | **Best For:** Urban shooters who value speed over capacity

I bought this bag specifically for street photography after the Bangkok market disaster. Best $169 I've spent on camera gear.

The Venture Sling breaks a cardinal rule of camera bags—**the dividers are sewn in, not adjustable**. Sounds like a dealbreaker, right? For street photography setups, it's brilliant. One camera body, two prime lenses, maybe a small zoom. That's it. The memory foam dividers mold around your specific gear instead of relying on velcro that wears out after a year.

Here's what sold me: I can swing this bag from my back to front in one motion, unzip the main compartment, swap lenses, and be shooting again in under 10 seconds. No setting the bag down on grimy sidewalks. No digging through layers of compartments.

The 10L capacity feels restrictive until you realize it forces discipline. I'm not carrying ""just in case"" lenses anymore—I bring what I'll actually use. My back thanks me after eight-hour shooting days.

**The catch:** No laptop sleeve. Zero weather protection beyond water-resistant fabric. And if you shoot with lens hoods (which take way more space than people realize), you'll struggle to fit more than a body and two lenses.

**Who this works for:** Fujifilm, Sony, and Leica shooters with compact mirrorless setups. Travel photographers who want a daypack that doesn't scream ""expensive camera inside."" Content creators bouncing between coffee shops.

**Who should skip it:** Anyone carrying a full-frame DSLR or multiple zoom lenses. You'll be playing Tetris every time you pack this thing.

# 3. WANDRD PRVKE 31L – Best for Travel Photographers

**Price:** \~$265 | **Best For:** One-bag travelers who need camera gear + clothes

The PRVKE has achieved cult status among travel photographers, and after using it for a three-week trip through Portugal, I understand why.

The roll-top design means this bag expands dramatically. When I'm just shooting around my city, I roll it down tight—looks sleek, carries light. When I'm traveling, I roll it open and suddenly have room for camera gear in the bottom compartment and 3-4 days of clothes in the expandable top section. It's basically two bags in one.

The camera cube system sits in the bottom half with rear-panel access (theft-deterrent when wearing it), while the roll-top holds everything else. I packed a camera body, 24-70mm, 16-35mm, 50mm prime, laptop, chargers, three shirts, extra pants, and toiletries. For a long weekend trip, I didn't need a separate suitcase.

**The design quirks:** That roll-top everyone loves? It's also the bag's biggest learning curve. The first few times I packed it, I felt like I was wrestling a tent. And accessing your camera requires setting the bag down and opening the rear panel—frustrating when you're trying to capture spontaneous moments.

Camera cubes are sold separately (\~$75 extra), which feels like hidden costs. Budget accordingly.

**The brilliant part:** The PRVKE doesn't look like a camera bag. At all. Walking through sketchy neighborhoods in Lisbon, I blended in with every other backpacker. That peace of mind is worth the price.

**Who this works for:** Digital nomads, travel bloggers, photographers who hate checking luggage, anyone doing multi-week trips with just a carry-on.

# 4. Lowepro ProTactic 450 AW II – Best for Professional Photographers

**Price:** \~$230 | **Best For:** Wedding photographers, event shooters, gear hoarders

If the ProTactic looks like it belongs in a tactical military operation, that's intentional. This bag is **built like a tank** and designed for photographers who need instant access to an absurd amount of gear.

I borrowed a colleague's ProTactic for a weekend wedding shoot, and it spoiled me. Four access points (top, bottom, sides, and rear panel) mean I could grab any piece of gear without taking the bag off. The MOLLE webbing on the exterior let me attach a flash bracket, extra batteries in a pouch, and a tripod holder. Everything I needed, exactly where I wanted it.

The modular divider system is the best I've tested—thick, padded, and actually stays put when you're rummaging for gear mid-ceremony. Unlike cheaper bags where dividers shift every time you reach inside.

**The reality check:** This bag weighs 8.8 pounds empty. Fully loaded with two camera bodies, four lenses, flash, and accessories, you're carrying 25+ pounds. After six hours shooting a wedding, my shoulders felt it. The included waist belt helps, but this isn't a casual daypack.

And it absolutely screams ""professional photographer."" Great for paid gigs where you want clients to see you as serious. Terrible for travel where you'd rather not advertise thousands of dollars of gear.

**Real capacity:** Two DSLR or mirrorless bodies, 70-200mm f/2.8, 24-70mm, two primes, flash, 15-inch laptop, filters, batteries, and still have room for snacks.

**Who this works for:** Wedding photographers, photojournalists covering events, anyone who needs to carry their entire kit and maintain quick access.

# 5. Shimoda Action X50 V2 – Best for Adventure Photographers

**Price:** \~$350 (without camera core unit, add $75-125) | **Best For:** Outdoor photographers who hike serious miles\*\*

The Shimoda bags are expensive. Let's just acknowledge that upfront. But after watching mine survive everything from alpine scrambles to desert sandstorms, I've stopped questioning the price.

This bag was **designed by adventure photographers who got tired of choosing between camera protection and hiking comfort**. The result is a pack that feels like a legitimate hiking backpack (adjustable torso length, load-lifter straps, padded hip belt) that happens to protect camera gear brilliantly.

The modular core unit system means you're buying two things: the backpack shell and a removable camera insert. Annoying for the wallet, genius for flexibility. On photography days, I use the Medium Core Unit (holds one body, three lenses). On multi-day backpacking trips, I swap to the Small Core Unit and fill the rest with camping gear.

The **7L roll-top expansion** swallowed a puffy jacket, rain pants, and a first aid kit when a storm rolled in during a Colorado shoot. That expansion saved me from having to strap stuff on the outside where it could get wet or snagged.

**The dealbreaker for some:** You MUST set this bag down to access your camera. The rear-panel design keeps dirt off the harness system, but if you're hiking solo and shooting frequently, constantly taking off a fully loaded pack gets old fast.

**Who this is perfect for:** Landscape photographers hiking into remote locations, wildlife photographers spending hours in the field, ski photographers who need room for safety gear alongside camera equipment.

# 6. Vanguard VEO F33 – Best Budget Option

**Price:** \~$70 | **Best For:** Beginners who need something functional without breaking the bank\*\*

Not everyone has $300 to drop on a camera bag, especially when you're still figuring out what kind of photographer you want to be. The VEO F33 proved to me you don't need premium pricing for a solid everyday bag.

This is the bag I recommend to friends just getting into photography. It holds a mirrorless camera body, two or three lenses, has decent padding, includes a rain cover, and costs less than a mid-tier lens filter. The dividers are basic velcro style that'll eventually wear out, but for $70, I'm not expecting Peak Design build quality.

I tested this as a ""loaner bag"" for visiting photographer friends for six months. It survived being tossed in car trunks, dropped on concrete once (oops), and carried through rain. Still functional, though the fabric shows wear.

**Honest limitations:** The zippers feel cheap because they are cheap. The shoulder straps aren't particularly comfortable for extended wear—after three hours with a full load, you'll feel it. And the side pockets barely fit a standard water bottle.

But here's what matters: it protects your gear adequately and costs the same as a decent camera strap. If you're a hobbyist shooting weekends or a student building your kit, this gets you 80% of the functionality at 25% of the cost.

**Who should buy it:** Photography students, casual enthusiasts, anyone wanting to test if they even like using camera bags before investing in premium options.

**Who should skip it:** Professional photographers who need durability for daily paid work, travelers who'll abuse their bag regularly, anyone carrying expensive glass who wants premium protection.

# How to Actually Choose Your Camera Bag

After testing all these bags, here's my decision framework:

**Ask yourself:**

1. **What's your primary shooting style?** Street needs speed, adventure needs comfort, professional work needs capacity.
2. **How much gear do you actually carry?** Be honest. Don't buy for your dream kit; buy for what's in your bag 90% of the time.
3. **What's your budget?** A $300 bag you'll use for 10 years is cheaper than three $100 bags that don't quite work.

The expensive bags (Peak Design, WANDRD, Shimoda) genuinely justify their cost with better materials, smarter designs, and warranty support. But the budget options (Vanguard, Lowepro's entry-level) work fine if you're not putting them through professional-level abuse.

**My honest take:** Most photographers will be happiest with either the Peak Design Everyday Backpack for versatility or the Bellroy Venture Sling for traveling light. Everything else depends on your specific shooting needs.

I’m 33F, and was recently diagnosed with stage 2 triple negative breast cancer. I’m going through chemo and finishing  my last round of Red Devil this Thursday, and then moving on to 12 weeks of Paclitaxel. And then seeing where the road will take me ( whether I have the bracker mutation etc ) 

I’m doing okay and staying positive and  I’m pretty headstrong about beating this ,  but I’ve been feeling quite alone in this space. I have amazing family support, but I don’t really have anyone who’s going through the same thing and gets what it actually feels like.

I was invited to a CANSA support group, but most of the women were a lot older (which I completely respect), and during chemo there isn’t anyone my age as well. I just really wish I could connect with someone closer to my age,  someone who’s in the same season of life and navigating all the emotions, the hair loss, the fatigue, the stopping ovaries , the everything.

So, I’m taking a bit of a leap by posting here,   But Reddit has always somehow remained my friend over the years.

1ose3g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ose3g5/which_backpacking_stove_is_the_most_compact_design/,Which backpacking stove is the most compact design?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been backpacking for about three years now, and one thing I learned the hard way is that every ounce matters when you're carrying everything on your back for miles. I used to bring this bulky camping stove that took up half my pack, and honestly, it was ridiculous.

After that nightmare trip, I got serious about finding the most compact backpacking stove out there. I've tested a bunch, talked to other hikers, and done way too much research on this topic.

**What Makes a Backpacking Stove Compact?**

The best compact stoves usually fold down super small or have parts that nest together. We're talking about something that can fit in your cooking pot or take up less space than a soda can. Weight is obviously important too, but size is what really saves pack space.

**The Top Compact Options**

From my experience, canister stoves are generally the most compact. They screw right onto those little fuel canisters and many of them fold down to almost nothing. Some weigh just a few ounces and pack down smaller than your phone.

Alcohol stoves are even tinier, but they're slower and not great in cold weather. I've used them for summer trips though, and they're pretty awesome when conditions are right.

The integrated systems are cool because everything nests together, but they're usually heavier overall even if they're space efficient.

**My Recommendation**

If you're looking for the absolute most compact design, check out the options at [this collection of backpacking stoves](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove). You'll find different styles and sizes that pack down really small. I spent hours comparing measurements and reviews before making my choice.

The key is matching your stove to your trip length and cooking needs. For weekend trips, I go ultra-light. For longer adventures, I want something slightly bigger but still packable.

**What to Consider Before Buying**

Think about what you actually cook on the trail. If you're just boiling water for freeze-dried meals and coffee, you don't need anything fancy. A simple compact canister stove works perfect.

Also consider the fuel availability where you hike. Canister fuel is easy to find at most outdoor stores, while alcohol or other fuel types might be harder to grab.

Weather matters too. Some lightweight stoves struggle in wind or cold temperatures, so if you hike in tough conditions, make sure your compact stove can handle it.

**Final Thoughts**

Switching to a compact backpacking stove was one of the best upgrades I made to my gear setup. My pack feels lighter, I have more room for other stuff, and I'm not wrestling with some giant stove setup at camp when I'm tired and hungry.

If you're in the market, definitely browse through [these backpacking stove options](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) and read the specs carefully. Look at the packed dimensions, not just the weight.

Trust me, your back will thank you on those long hiking days. And having that extra space in your pack for snacks or an extra layer? Totally worth it.

I can honestly say I fell in love with Stan Rogers and his songs. His music is truly special but the memory I would like to share is from the when I turned 21.

I thought I'd heard all of Stan's songs but you know there is always something you haven't heard or didn't find.

I was taking a greyhound bus moving back home from Alberta at the time. It was Christmas Eve and I had just broken up with someone, got kicked out of my place with nowhwere to go. The trip home was going to be two days.

I had a playlist on an MP3 Player my brother gave me and just hit play. He had put Stan's entire discography on it and I guess I never got to the last song.

As I was riding that bus uncomfortable and exhausted First Christmas started playing. I had never heard it before, and it brought tears to my eyes. Strangely enough it was my first Christmas away from home.

I guess something clicked because for two days that was the only song I listened too. I put it on repeat and charged the mp3 player at every stopx I could.

I guess at some point I was humming the tune while at one of the depots waiting for the next bus and a guy playing guitar heard me, he started playing it, I took out my headphones and listened. Dropped a few dollars in his guitar case and bought him a coffee.

The guy didn't have the best voice but he was decent and played and sang the song a few times as we were the only people waiting for the bus as this was 3 in the morning. Then we talked about which songs we liked and how we got into Stan's music. 

That guitar player was a kind soul as far as I am concerned. He kept a stranger company and chstted for a few hours. It warmed my heart. I still listen to First Christmas every chance I get even when it isn't the season, it is one of my favorite songs.

i went over to their place to babysit last saturday. when i got there the house was... a lot. like really messy. there were takeout boxes on the coffee table, clothes on the floor, and the kitchen just had stuff all over the counters. its not usually this bad but its getting worse.

the mom's roommate was there too. he's a nice guy but he's just really laid back i guess. he was in the kitchen making this huge plate of leftover meatloaf. like a mountain of it. the little guy was super excited and the roommate gave him a powdered donut to hold him over. i brought an apple for him but the roommate laughed and said a growing boy needs more energy.

so i'm trying to play with the little guy but he is just bouncing off the walls. he was running around with the donut and then he got powdered sugar all over the couch and his shirt. the roommate didnt even notice, he was just focused on his food. later the little guy wanted to play hide and seek and he tried to hide in this closet that was just packed full of stuff. i had to get him out because i was worried it would all fall on him.

the mom came home a few hours later and the little guy was still so hyped up. i was trying to get him to calm down with a story but he just kept interrupting and talking about sugar. i felt really bad for her because she looked so tired.

when she paid me i made a stupid joke like wow someone had a good time. and then i opened my big mouth. i said something like, its really hard to get a kid to calm down in a space that's so busy, and maybe all the sugar isn't helping him. i said it nicely, i thought. i was worried about him.

the mom just got really quiet. then she told me i was out of line. she said i don't understand her life and i have no right to judge her home or her roommate. she said she thought i was there to help not to criticize everything. she said i should just keep my progressive parenting ideas to myself.

i felt awful and i left right away. i havent talked to her since. now im thinking that i was totally the asshole. i was a guest in her home and i basically told her she was a bad mom and her life was a mess. i was only thinking about the little guy and how i want what's best for him, but maybe it was not my place to say anything. i was trying to help but i just made her feel bad. so, AITA?",2,1762676480.0,AITAH,5,0.75,False

(Rant),"Made a difficult decision to pivot to a STEM major since AI has desecrated my previous degree which is its own story. Saw that getting another bachelors would be shitty but at least I only need to worry about a smaller portion of pre-req's, specifically math & sciences and the potential future career path is worth the timesink this late in my career.

Passed Calculus 1 but so many gaps and holes from prior stuff is being exposed in Calc 2, particularly when handling Integration by Parts and all the different forms and strategies. 

Just very depressing and very upsetting. It's not for lack of trying or practice, but there seems to be a very real situation where Calc 2 requires a sturdy foundation across a degree of subsections and techniques that just feel impossible to remember it all. Not just calc 1 stuff but definitely pre-calc and even just like algebra rules that didn't have their muscles used as much as we jumped from math subject to subject growing up.

The main thing seems to be that those who have a mastery of identities and how that look on paper can manipulate and remanipulate the alphabet soup in front of them into pieces that fit cleaner but that is something I am struggling with. Really don't know what to tackle first. Need to get to a stage where understanding relationships in the algebra/trig/etc. becomes as second nature as arithmetic. Sucks cause as soon as i see a logarithm or trig integral and suddenly things just derail real fast.

Other classes are going great. Physics is fine, the calc we use in that is basic derivatives as of right now and some basic integrals. But the type of setups and expressions thrown at us in calc 2 quite frankly, fucking suck. 

Sets and series is a cakewalk. Actual joke. Same w/ polar coordinates and whatnot.   
It's just the limits (sort of. mileage varies), differentials conceptually and the integrals and identities and the fact that it really does feel like we cherry pick rules for special cases and then suddenly decide they don't matter anymore. Too many specific use-cases where left becomes right and up becomes down suddenly and the notation sometimes gets hard to follow.

Anyways just was trying to run integral drills/practice from sample problems found online and got every single one of them wrong. After explanations they all made sense and I saw how they got there but doesn't change the fact that my first attempt is almost always incorrect, and that matters on (arbitrary) exams. I don't really have much time to fuck around and mess up grade-wise.

So just wanted to rant for a bit. But at the same time I guess if anyone has any flash-card friendly suggestions I can make them and then just review em during morning coffee. Thanks.

1osdzgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1osdzgk/how_to_cope_with_daytime_sleepiness/,How to cope with daytime sleepiness,"So I'm struggling with sleep, especially waking up early. I fall asleep okay, but always wake up at 5am, and I'm still tired and need more than 6h of sleep.

 I am being treated after suffering from an anxiety disorder for 3+ years (and noticing slow improvements!). My therapist also helps me with a sleep routine and hygiene, and I'm getting a sleep study done in a few weeks. 

I'm not super confident this will help a lot: I've been a poor sleeper forever, also before I developed an anxiety disorder, and I don't expect to have sleep apnea or so (can't be sure but I don't snore or wake up gasping). Still, it's good ro rule things out and get my anxiety treated.

Until recently, I suffered mostly from mental fatigue etc, but now, I am also really, really sleepy during the day. I don't fall asleep watching tv or at work, but I feel like I need a nap the whole day! Obviously that's neither possible nor wise, so what else to do?

I only drink 1-2 cups of coffee in the morning, I love napping but wake up feeling even worse, I like going for a walk but I don't always have time (e.g. when I'm working)... Any other healthy suggestions to deal with the sleepiness?


(Now that I'm writing this, I'm wondering if my lower anxiety actually makes me sleepy. When I'm stressed and anxious, adrenaline keeps me going. Maybe this sleepiness is a good sign of slightly lower anxiety, and perhaps the result of 3+ years of generalized anxiety?) ",1,1762676294.0,sleep,6,1.0,False

1osdwp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1osdwp5/finding_the_best_duffle_bag_for_you/,Finding the Best Duffle Bag for You,"I'll never forget standing at baggage claim in Lima, watching my brand-new wheeled suitcase come down the conveyor belt with one wheel completely torn off. That was the moment I became a duffle bag convert.

Three years and about forty flights later, I've learned something crucial: the ""best"" duffle bag doesn't exist. What exists is the best duffle bag *for your specific situation*—and figuring that out means ignoring a lot of marketing hype and focusing on how you actually travel.

I've tested everything from $40 Amazon specials to $300 expedition duffels, dragged them through airport terminals, tossed them in car trunks for road trips, and used them as makeshift pillows on overnight buses. Some held up beautifully. Others? Well, let's just say I learned some expensive lessons.

Here's what actually matters when you're choosing a duffle bag, based on what I've learned through trial, error, and one very memorable zipper failure in the middle of a crowded airport.

# 1. Patagonia Black Hole Duffel 55L — The Goldilocks Option

**Price:** $169 (sometimes on sale for \~$118)

**Best for:** People who want one bag that does everything reasonably well

I resisted buying this bag for over a year because it felt like *such* a cliché. Everyone has one. Every travel blog recommends it. But here's the thing: there's a reason for that.

The 55L capacity is legitimately perfect for 3-4 day trips, and I've pushed it to a week by using packing cubes strategically. The 900-denier recycled polyester feels almost plasticky, but that's what makes it so durable—mine has survived everything from Thai tuk-tuk roofs to aggressive baggage handlers without showing significant wear.

**What actually works:** The removable backpack straps are game-changing when you're navigating airports. They're not *comfortable* for long hikes (they're lightly padded), but for getting from check-in to your gate while your hands are free for coffee? Perfect. The side pocket that doubles as a stuff sack is genuinely clever—though fair warning, packing the entire bag into that pocket requires some very specific folding that took me about five tries to figure out.

**The honest downsides:** It's not waterproof, just water-resistant. I learned this the hard way during a sudden downpour in Seattle—my clothes were damp but not soaked. Also, there's basically zero internal organization. You're looking at one big cavity with a single mesh pocket. Packing cubes aren't optional with this bag; they're survival equipment.

The padded base is actually protective—I once accidentally dropped my laptop (in its case) inside from waist height and it survived without a scratch. But that same padding makes the bag less packable than some ultralight options.

**Who should skip this:** If you need serious weatherproofing or lots of organizational pockets, this isn't it. Also, if you consistently carry heavy loads (over 40 pounds), the backpack straps start feeling inadequate.

**Current status after 2 years:** Still my go-to for weekend trips and short flights. Has some scuffs that honestly make it look cooler.

# 2. REI Co-op Roadtripper 60L — The Budget Champion

**Price:** $65-70

**Best for:** Extra bag storage, car camping, or when you need something cheap that works

Let me be honest: this bag won't change your life. But for seventy bucks? It's shockingly competent.

I bought mine specifically for a camping trip where I needed something to haul sleeping bags and tent gear from the car to the campsite. I expected it to last maybe that trip and a few more before falling apart. That was eighteen months ago, and it's still going strong.

**What actually works:** The weight is remarkable—just 1.5 pounds empty. That's lighter than most of my t-shirts. It packs down into its own included pouch, which becomes genuinely useful when you're worried about coming home with more stuff than you left with. I've packed it empty inside my main luggage more times than I can count.

The 60L capacity is *generous*. I've fit a week's worth of winter clothing in here, though it looked like an overstuffed sausage. The shoulder strap and multiple handle positions give you options for carrying, which matters more than you'd think when you're navigating crowded spaces.

**The honest downsides:** It's not durable in any meaningful way. The fabric is thin, the zippers are standard quality, and I wouldn't trust it with anything fragile or valuable. Water resistance? Basically none. I left it in light rain for about 30 minutes and everything inside was damp.

There's minimal organization—one small external pocket and that's it. No compression straps, no backpack mode, no fancy features. It's literally a fabric tube with handles.

**Who should skip this:** Anyone who needs weather protection, frequent flyers (it won't survive aggressive baggage handlers), or people who need to carry their bag for extended periods. The lack of backpack straps means shoulder-carrying a heavy load gets old fast.

**Current status after 18 months:** Holding up for car trips and casual use. Developed some scuffs and the fabric looks lived-in, but no structural issues yet.

# 3. The North Face Base Camp Duffel 71L (Medium) — The Indestructible Tank

**Price:** $130-185 (varies by retailer and sales)

**Best for:** People who abuse their luggage, expedition travel, or anyone tired of replacing bags

This bag looks like it was designed to survive a nuclear apocalypse, and honestly? It might.

The Base Camp has been around since 1986 for a reason—The North Face originally designed it for Himalayan expeditions, and that DNA shows in every reinforced stitch. The tarpaulin material is *thick*. Like, almost comically thick. The first time I picked one up, I thought it was already packed with something heavy. Nope, that's just the bag.

**What actually works:** The four compression straps actually do something, unlike the decorative versions on cheaper bags. I've cinched this down to fit it (barely) in an overhead bin, and I've also expanded it to carry truly absurd amounts of gear for camping trips.

The end-cap pocket is perfect for dirty shoes or wet clothes—it's essentially a separate compartment that doesn't touch your main storage. This might not seem revolutionary until you're dealing with muddy hiking boots and clean clothes in the same bag.

The removable backpack straps are sturdy and reasonably comfortable, though taking them on and off requires threading them through buckles, which is tedious if you're doing it frequently (like for air travel when airlines make you remove straps).

**The honest downsides:** It's *heavy*. The Medium weighs about 3.5 pounds empty, which eats into your weight limit if you're checking it. It's also overkill for most casual travel—this is expedition gear, not weekend warrior gear.

The material shows scuffs more obviously than the Black Hole's matte finish. It's not ugly, exactly, but it definitely looks used after a few trips. Some people love that weathered look. Others don't.

**Who should skip this:** Weekend travelers who prioritize weight savings, anyone who wants something that packs down small, or people who don't regularly subject their luggage to serious abuse.

**Current status:** I borrowed my friend's for a three-week overlanding trip through Patagonia. After being strapped to a roof rack, dropped repeatedly, and dragged through volcanic dust, it looked exactly the same as when we started. That's when I became a believer.

# 4. Osprey Transporter 40L — The Smart Weekender

**Price:** Around $110-130

**Best for:** Weekend trips, gym bags, or anyone who wants organization without excess

The Transporter doesn't get the same hype as the Black Hole, but after using both, I actually prefer the Osprey for short trips.

The 40L capacity might sound small, but it's perfectly sized for 2-3 day trips without tempting you to overpack (a personal weakness). It fits easily in overhead bins on even the strictest budget airlines—something I appreciated immensely on a Ryan air flight where they were measuring everyone's bags with those little metal frames.

**What actually works:** The carrying system is legitimately comfortable. The backpack straps have more padding than the Black Hole's, and there's a sternum strap (which Patagonia skips). This matters if you're walking more than 10 minutes with a loaded bag.

The internal organization includes multiple zippered mesh pockets that actually keep things separated. I can find my charging cables without dumping everything out, which is a small luxury that I've come to appreciate.

The fabric has a more matte, sophisticated look than the shiny Black Hole. It doesn't scream ""outdoor gear"" as loudly, which works better for business travel.

**The honest downsides:** Water resistance is about the same as the Black Hole—adequate but not exceptional. The capacity limit is real; I can fit four days maximum, and even that requires strategic packing.

Some people find the lower capacity limiting, but I've found it forces me to pack smarter, which usually means I'm carrying less unnecessary stuff.

**Who should skip this:** Anyone who regularly takes trips longer than four days, or anyone who tends to pack heavy and wants more volume.

# How to Actually Choose

Forget about finding the ""perfect"" duffle. Ask yourself these questions instead:

**How often will you use it?** If it's your primary travel bag, invest in the Patagonia or North Face. If it's a backup or occasional-use bag, the Roadtripper is fine.

**What's your travel style?** Quick weekend trips favor the Osprey. Extended adventures with gear need the North Face. Everything in between probably wants the Black Hole.

**How rough is your travel?** Baggage handlers, roof racks, and expedition travel? Base Camp. Carry-ons and car trunks? Any of them work.

**What's your budget?** Under $100: Roadtripper. Around $170: Black Hole or Osprey. Maxed out: Base Camp.

The duffle I reach for most often is the Black Hole 55L, but I wouldn't have said that was *obvious* until I'd tried several others. Your answer might be different, and that's the point. The best duffle bag for you is the one that matches how you actually travel, not how Instagram thinks you should.

What kind of travel do you do most? That might help narrow this down even further.",1,1762676009.0,PackAndGo,0,1.0,False
