I feel weird as this is my first post as a long time lurker. Basically I'm querying in batches but I got all rejections. Starting to think there's something wrong with this QL. I desperately need your help!

I tried to keep my synopsis under 500 words (as that was the most guidelines I received). Please be brutally honest because I've tricked myself into thinking I have an amazing query letter and I indeed need some reality check! Here's the query letter:

Dear (Agent),

I'm reaching out to submit my debut YA Thriller, NO SAINTS AMONG US, which is complete at 100,000 words. It follows four teens bound by deadly secrets who must overcome their differences and work together to clear their names after being framed for murder. I would position the novel alongside works such as ONE OF US IS LYING by Karen M. McManus and A GOOD GIRL'S GUIDE TO MURDER by Holly Jackson.

When 17-year-old Charlotte Rhodes is found dead at a party in Bath, police zero in on four suspects. Each has a hidden connection to her and a motive they'd do anything to keep buried.  
**Stella Faye Santoro,** once Charlotte's best friend, knows betrayal all too well. After Charlotte stole her boyfriend and made their fallout a public scandal, it’s no surprise she’s the prime suspect.  
**James Everett,** basketball captain, built his reputation on talent. Or so everyone believes. Charlotte knew he was using performance enhancers to stay on top. Worse, he knew about her affair with the coach.   
**Juniper Warnock,** Charlotte's academic rival, kept her family's skeletons locked away. Until Charlotte uncovered her father’s ties to a money-laundering scheme. Leverage she didn’t hesitate to use.  
**Leonardo Towns** loved Charlotte, blinded to her flaws. The night she was killed, his emotions got the best of him, leading him to destroy evidence. His guilt runs deeper than anyone suspects.  
The four suspects form a fragile alliance, bound by a shared determination to protect their secrets. But as they dig deeper, they begin to realise they might not be so different after all, and might even need each other to survive.

*\*Please note that this novel contains depictions of an eating disorder.*

The novel is an upper YA thriller/mystery, best suited for readers aged 16-22. While firmly in the YA category, I believe its tone and depth make it engaging for both teen and adult readers.

I'm 26 and live in London, where I work in marketing. I'm originally from Türkiye, so I'd like to think my writing is like a well-brewed cup of Turkish coffee: dark, intense, and best enjoyed with a side of secrets. I studied Media and Visual Arts in university, which gave me a strong understanding of storytelling and how to craft scenes with a cinematic edge. *No Saints Among Us* will hopefully be my debut!

**Synopsis:**

When 17-year-old Charlotte Rhodes is found dead at a party in Bath, the city is left in shock. Charlotte wasn’t just admired, she was feared. Beautiful, magnetic, and dangerously skilled at uncovering secrets, she thrived on control. But someone wanted her gone. The police quickly identify four suspects, with their main target being Charlotte’s ex-best friend, Stella Faye Santoro. After Charlotte stole her boyfriend and publicly humiliated her, Stella’s life collapsed. Now, with her reputation in ruins and a relentless detective closing in, she has a choice: clear her name or be branded a murderer forever. The only way to prove her innocence? Working with the very people who might have killed Charlotte.

James Everett, the keeper of her secret. Juniper Warnock, the academic rival. Leonardo Towns, the lover rejected. They all had a reason to want her dead. As if being suspects wasn’t enough, the detective shows up at school, again and again, dragging them out of class like criminals. The rumours spread fast. The whispers turn to stares. And just like that, the entire school turns against them. Then the threats begin. Anonymous notes. Warnings that someone is watching. But while the others find theirs at school, Stella’s note is left inside her home. A silent message: Charlotte’s killer isn’t done. The four of them are running out of time. The threats escalate, their pasts catching up to them faster than they can outrun them.

A month after the murder, Stella sees her little sister waving at a stranger. Only, she isn’t a stranger. Her name is Palmer, the one who left the notes. Before Stella can warn anyone, Palmer gets her into her car. Palmer is Charlotte’s half-sister, the result of their father’s brief affair. While Charlotte basked in their late father’s legacy, Palmer was erased. She had four years to plan. Four perfect targets. The car ends up in a crash. Palmer is caught. But how did she get away with it for so long? Because the detective knew the truth all along. He destroyed evidence. Manipulated leads. Let Palmer walk free. Not for justice, but for love. Palmer’s mother was the woman he had spent his life obsessed with. And for that, he didn’t just betray his badge. He betrayed them all.",1,1740658488.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

## unpacking the Thule Subterra 25L Features: A Detailed Examination

To truly understand the thule Subterra 25L backpack, we need to dissect its features, evaluating their functionality and value proposition for each target audience. Let's break it down:

**Dimensions and Capacity:** As the name suggests, the Thule Subterra 25L boasts a 25-liter capacity. This is where the Thule Subterra 25L dimensions become crucial – is it truly spacious enough for your needs? For travelers, the 25L capacity generally fits within carry-on size restrictions for most airlines, making it a convenient travel companion. Though, heavy packers might find it limiting. The specific dimensions are crucial for ensuring compatibility with airline regulations and overhead bin space.

**Laptop Compartment:** A key feature for digital nomads, students, and professionals is the dedicated, padded laptop compartment.The Thule Subterra 25L laptop compartment is designed to protect laptops up to a certain size (typically 15-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro). The level of padding, ease of access, and any additional security features (like a false bottom) are critical considerations. Is the laptop compartment easily accessible when going through airport security? Does it provide adequate cushioning to protect your valuable device from bumps and drops?

**Organization:** The Thule Subterra 25L features a variety of pockets and compartments designed to keep your belongings organized. This includes internal pockets for smaller items like pens, chargers, and cables, as well as external pockets for quick access to water bottles, phones, and other essentials.The presence of organizational features is a major selling point. How intuitive and useful are these pockets? Do they cater to the specific needs of different users?

**Material and Durability:** The durability of a backpack is paramount, especially for frequent travelers and outdoor enthusiasts. The Thule Subterra 25L is typically constructed from durable, water-resistant materials like nylon or polyester. The quality of the stitching, zippers, and other hardware also contributes to its overall longevity. Considering the Thule Subterra 25L price, is the material quality commensurate with the cost? Does it offer enough protection against the elements and everyday wear and tear?

**Comfort:** Carrying a fully loaded backpack can be taxing, so comfort is essential. The Thule Subterra 25L backpack features padded shoulder straps and a back panel designed to distribute weight evenly and provide ventilation. The adjustability of the straps, the presence of a sternum strap, and the breathability of the back panel all contribute to overall comfort. Is the padding sufficient for heavier loads? Does the ventilation system effectively prevent sweating?

**Design and Aesthetics:** The Thule Subterra 25L design is frequently enough described as sleek and modern, with a minimalist aesthetic that appeals to both professionals and casual users. It's typically available in neutral colors like black and gray, making it versatile enough to suit various styles and settings. Aesthetics are subjective, but the design should be functional and visually appealing. Does the backpack look professional enough for the workplace? Is it too generic or does it stand out in a positive way? The Thule Subterra Backpack 25L black color option is a popular choice for those seeking a versatile and understated look.

However, if they need to carry bulky samples, the 25L capacity might be insufficient.

1izeayw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1izeayw/xcaret_arte_7_night_stay_review/,Xcaret Arte 7 night stay review,"Myself and my partner are just back from a 7-night stay at Xcaret Arte from the UK, and found everyone else’s posts extremely helpful in our planning, so here is a review of our own. Overall we had an amazing time, this is a mind-blowing incredible resort. 

Our arrival was pretty smooth - we flew into Cancun airport late afternoon and found the shuttle bus quite easily to take us to the hotel. When we arrived someone took our luggage and we were asked to join a group of others checking in, and we were all given a brief tour of the hotel and taken to the reception of Casa Artistas. We weren’t supposed to be staying in Artistas but were told we could check-in there anyway for our room in Diseño or Piramide. During check-in we were asked if we were celebrating anything and we told them we were celebrating both of our birthdays and both of us completing our PhDs. We were offered a promotional price to upgrade to Artistas which we declined, and then they ended up offering us the upgrade for free because of our celebrations and because we’d travelled such a long way and it was our first time in Mexico! We were given an ocean front room with a gorgeous view and obviously could then take advantage of all the Artistas perks - butler service, access to the Artistas rooftop pool, access to Kibi Kibi etc. so that was fantastic. Nobody asked us about the timeshare/membership during check-in or at any other point during our stay and if they had, I can’t imagine they wouldn’t have politely accepted a “no thank you” when that worked for absolutely everything else we were offered that we didn’t want. 

Food - we were super impressed by the food overall. I’m kinda side-eyeing any reviews which say all the food was bad or that they didn’t enjoy any of it because there are so many different options at the resort. Sure we didn’t love everything, and there were things we tried that we disliked, but it’s all-inclusive, so we could always just order something else or go to the mercado buffet if we were still hungry and there was loads of food we loved. We went to all of the restaurants on the Arte side except Cayuco and Apapachoa. Our faves were probably Tah-Xido and Chino Poblano, but we also loved a lot of the stuff at Mercado and ate there a lot. Kibi Kibi was also great for breakfast especially. We also ordered food a couple times at the artistas rooftop pool which was great, and the cafe does great iced coffee. In terms of drinks, the cocktails are maybe not the strongest, but you can always ask for a shot on the side. You can request your drink to be made with a specific brand of alcohol and it’s no problem. We only went to the speakeasy once as we’re early to bed, early to rise people on holiday but it was a good vibe and a cool concept. 

My one critique would be that my partner has allergies to some nuts and it was a bit of a mixed bag how well this was accommodated. The host and wait staff at every restaurant asked about allergies every time, but it was then handled inconsistently when it came to actually ordering and understanding which things had nuts in. She had a great experience at Chino Poblano for example - the dishes on the tasting menu which had nuts all had a nut-free equivalent that were still delicious and planned out and allowed her to still enjoy the experience. But at Mercado, nothing is labelled for allergens, and the staff didn’t always know what was in the food. I think we would’ve been concerned about eating there if her allergies were more severe. On the other hand some servers were almost over-cautious and wouldn’t serve her any nuts (even though she’s only allergic to a few) or anything that would be cross-contaminated (when her allergy is only for actually eating).

Parks/activities - we did Xcaret, Xplor, Xenses, and Xenotes, and that felt like a really good mix between the activities and time at the resort since we were only there 7 nights. We knocked out Xenses and Xplor on the same day because it was raining all day so we wouldn’t really have enjoyed time by the pool anyway, and at Xcaret we did the activities we wanted to do (including Sea Trek which was incredible and worth the extra cost) in a morning and were back at the resort by lunch. Xenotes was our favourite even though we are a bit scared of some stuff - we avoided the cliff jumps but did everything else and it was all really manageable and fun. It was also totally fine to opt in or out of each of the activities, plenty of people in the group didn’t want to do some of the scarier stuff and it was completely OK. In general the parks and activities are all really well managed in terms of locker access, clean facilities, ease of getting around - I worried it would feel a bit manic/stressful but it wasn’t at all and it was easy to just concentrate on having fun.

Service - pretty much everyone we interacted with was super nice and friendly and accommodating. We mostly used our butlers to help with reservations e.g. they booked sea trek for us and then rescheduled it when it got cancelled because of wind. They also sent the hotel doctor to our room after I fell down a couple of stairs on our rainy day at Xplor (wet stairs + wet crocs = ouch). They could book kayaks for us on request for the lagoon which was great - the lagoon is such a beautiful feature of the resort and it was great to be able to kayak and swim in there if we were fed up of sitting by the pool. We spent a lot of time at the Artistas rooftop pool and the staff there are great, they’d move us to a cabana as soon as there was one available, they are always checking to see if you want to order another drink or need extra towels etc. We also both did the hydrotherapy at Muluk Spa and I got a hot stone massage and a facial - the treatments have to be booked directly with the spa, we did it in advance of our trip over email and asked them what packages they had available and they had different combos/prices that weren’t listed on their website. It is expensive but it was my birthday so it felt worth it, and I would recommend as it really was a lovely spa and great treatments again with super friendly staff. We didn’t bring a lot of cash for tips (and we actually didn’t see anyone tipping when we were there) but we did leave $2 per day for housekeeping, $10 for our xenotes tour guide, and then $30 for our butlers. We brought USD because we couldn’t get pesos. Other than on the xenotes tour there was never a direct ask for tips and we never felt weird about not tipping or like it was expected. 

Overall we had such a great time and would encourage everyone to take negative reviews with a pinch of salt and not to worry, it’s an incredible resort and you’ll have an amazing time. Sure, there were a couple of things that weren’t completely perfect, but ultimately this is a huge resort run by a lot of people and it’s easy for things to go wrong sometimes and not everything will please everyone. The resort itself is so beautiful and there’s so much to see and do, and it feels like everything is set up to maximise your enjoyment and comfort and quality of life during your stay.

She got a call from her boss who needed to see her right away to discuss something so she had to bring me along; he was at his hangar. We drove out there with me tossing Cheetos out of the sunroof and watching them fly away. Their meeting got boring pretty quickly so I started to wonder around. I stopped to watch a guy taxiing his plane into his hangar. When he saw me watching he stopped and got out. He asked me if I was interested in planes and offered to let me finish moving it into the hangar. He put me in the cockpit and although I know now he was controlling it somehow he made me feel like I was actually doing it. When we got the plane inside we sat down, split a 7-UP and talked. There was a book/album on the coffee table he wouldn't let me look at. We eventually split ways and by the time I made it back to my mom's friend her meeting was over. It never occurred to me to ask his name. When I got home I told my mom the story and got the usual parental platitudes of ""that sounds fun"", etc. A little later I was watching TV and a commercial came on advertising 'Unforgiven' and I shouted ""that's the guy I met"" and my mom freaked out explaining to me that I had met a movie star. She was much more interested in the story after that.   
  
I think he was just happy to interact with someone that had no idea who he was. I suspect the book/album I couldn't look at was something that would've shown who he really was.",4,1740658226.0,self,1,1.0,False

1ize8nu,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1ize8nu/looking_for_some_encouragement/,Looking for some encouragement,"Hello all 

I saw a job interview on 8th January on LinkedIn, applied next day and got called by the hiring manager for a coffee meet up the following day. That was fast! It was an incredibly great interview. She found my profile great, told me I did study the company well and we spoke about a lot of other things. Both our partners are French so we even had some personal conversations. She told me that I might be called for a second round of interview with her boss (country director) soon. I sent her an email 3 days later to reiterate my interest to work with the company and made some points to express why I fit the bill. She didn’t reply.

21 of January no news and I though may be I haven’t been selected , what is there to loose, I’d send her a message to ask where is my application at? She replied immediately telling me that they have decided to hold the second round after the Chinese new year holidays (I am based in Singapore). She writes to me on the 4th February to let me know if I could come the next day to see her boss. I was suffering from 102 degrees fever but I said yes. I was extremely dizzy and feverish but still made it. The lady I met asked me a few question but her boss from the very beginning looked hostile. As though he was forcing himself to be in the room. (He is danish). Very reluctant in asking question and very cold. 30 minutes in the interview he took his phone and left the office and 10 minutes later the lady thanked me for the time and told me that the next round will be with the global sales director and I need to give her about a week to let me know. When I left , her director outside was on phone , no thanks no bye and I found this incredibly rude. 
10 days later I ask her if was being considered for the third round? This was on February 18th. She replied to me on February 24th that her boss still didn’t give any feedback to her so she doesn’t know if I am going on third round or not. 
Today - February 27th I receive this as message :

<<<< Hi N, I got the update from the 2nd interview that unfortunately your profile is not successful to go for next round interview. some feedback from the interview: we recommend you could slow down your pace and listen more, dont interrupt others when they are expressing. my VP shared that in a number of topics that you stepped into the conversation that we started and just took it sideway. We thank you for your time and effort, and wish you best of luck looking for future opportunity >>>

I just don’t get how a person who met me for 30 minutes write such a negative feedback. I am having a hard time with this rejection as I don’t remember really cutting them when they were speaking. I am a diagnosed ADHD but with my pills I have slowed down way more than before . Not to forget I was sick that day.
Clearly the boss has a say in the recruitment more than the lady but what I don’t understand , almost three weeks of working side by side , she couldn’t get a feedback for me? I am feeling so discouraged and my confidence has taken such a hit. 
Need some words of encouragement and motivation.
Thanks

The rain hit the pavement in slow, steady drips, washing away the filth of the city, but not the corruption. Ethan Ashford stood outside the crime scene, gripping the cigarette between his fingers. It had been years since he’d set foot in one of these places—too many memories, too many ghosts. But here he was, dragged back into the game he swore he’d never play again.

Detective Harper, an old colleague, stood next to him. She sighed. “I didn’t think I’d see you here, Ashford.”

Ethan exhaled, watching the smoke twist into the night. “Yeah, well… neither did I.”

Inside, the penthouse reeked of blood and expensive whiskey. The body of **Daniel Kessler**, CEO of Nexus Tech, was sprawled across a glass coffee table. The scene was too familiar. The same positioning, the same twisted grin. Ethan knew it well.

Harper flipped through her notes. “You see it too, don’t you?”

Ethan nodded. “It’s a copycat.”

She frowned. “Copying what?”

“My last case.”

Harper blinked. “The one that got you benched?”

“The one that got my partner killed,” Ethan corrected, his voice flat.

The air turned heavy. Harper hesitated. “You think this is personal?”

Ethan crouched beside the body, studying the thin line across Kessler’s throat. “I think whoever did this wants me to know they’re still out there.”

A buzzing sound cut through the tension. Harper checked her phone. “Forensics says there’s something you should see.”

The lab was cold, sterile, nothing like the warmth of a whiskey glass at midnight. Ethan leaned against the counter as the forensic tech, a young woman named Carla, slid a bag across the table.

“We found this in Kessler’s mouth.”

Inside the bag was a single playing card. The **King of Spades**.

Ethan felt a chill crawl up his spine. “Son of a bitch.”

Ang usual ko na inoorder sa Starbucks ay: “VENTI white chocolate mocha with vanilla cold foam and tre extra caramel drizzle”, which costs ₱275 pesos.

Nasatisfy needs ko nitong Zus. Mas maganda rin ambiance sa loob ng ibang Zus Coffee branches dahil sa pline-play na music. 

Here are my reasons why I agree na Zus Coffee na ang next na Starbucks:

• Unique Flavors at saka Transparent sa nga ingredients na nakalagay.

• Affordability

• Sustainability efforts

I am kinda entering the midlife crisis. I've been into cars since childhood. Used to read several car magazines regularly for years, participating in car forums, talking about cars over coffee breaks, enjoying karting etc... But I found myself in a situation where my desire for new cars is inversely proportional to my financials.

In 2023 I decided to buy a new Tesla MY, primarily because it seemed to offer a new unique experience and still was quite practical. Experience is indeed unique but over time it no longer excites me, but I still have to bear with some small drawbacks like upholstery feel, weird looks, quite basic soundproofing.

I looked at a couple of used BMW IX today and the day before, it feels better, but I am still unsure if it is worth the premium for me, I did not fall in love with it. A bit concerned about its vegan leather.

Could you advise what else to look at? I do not have a hard budget limit, but I would hate seeing my car depreciating by 100000 a year, so probably looking for something used within 300k.

I'd like to have an EV/PHEV for immediate response to throttle pedal and for the ability to start cooling the interior via mobile app ahead of departure without those gas emissions.

I have a charger at home, and my profile is many short trips within Dubai daily. And I have another ICE SUV for longer trips, so range is not an issue.

Feel like my ideal car could be Cayenne E-hybrid, but Porsche has been struggling to introduce mobile connectivity locally.

Any recommendations, thoughts? Thank you!

The place has poor air quality, and after my shifts, I started experiencing headaches, nose irritation, chest heaviness, and later stomach issues.

I have previous experience at another coffee shop, so I already know how to make coffee, but this store had a different way of doing things. Still, no one even took 10 minutes to explain their setup, how their coffee stands worked, or to show me around. I had to figure everything out on my own.

When I mentioned the mold smell to a coworker, they just said “Everywhere in this country is like this.” Another coworker told me I’d get used to it. And when I asked manager ( who is all the time feeling bad and goes home early) about this situation , I got response that she is not the owner and cannot do anything . And that they are waiting for renovation maybe this year , but she does not know if it even will happen. 

I haven’t officially quit yet—I called in sick, but I already have a resignation message drafted. I just don’t know if I should send it because the job market is brutal right now, and this is the only place that offered me a job.

The [newly magical](https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsPlayStories/comments/1iym241/not_so_berry_straud_descendants_gen_10_ep_4_a/) Skye woke up the morning of xir birthday in a cold sweat, a lingering feeling of weakness and exhaustion clinging to them.

Xir long experience with nightmares didn’t make them any easier to deal with. Taking a page from xir nightly yoga sessions, xe focused on xir breathing until it steadied. The gentle purring of the fuzzy familiar at the foot of their bed calmed xem even further as xe gave her a tight hug.

“So kiddo, big day” Luigi commented with a smile over breakfast. “Last day at Cooperdale and then your birthday party tonight. You ready?”

Skye frowned as xe suddenly realized that moving to The Bay meant xe would no longer have these daily meals with xir parents to help prepare xem for the day. Xir dad’s naturally cheerful nature had always been the perfect foil for Skye’s naturally gloomy one, while Elyse was prone to the same melancholy thoughts that regularly plagued xem. “Dad?” xe finally asked “How do you manage to be so happy all the time?”

Luigi patted xem on the arm. “Honestly, finding the bright side has always come naturally to me, but I have bad days, too. I think the secret is focusing on what makes you feel good and letting go of things that don’t serve you. It’s easier said than done, but it’s a goal that gives you a head start on joy.”

“That seems reasonable” Skye agreed, thinking on their near future and how they could start putting that good advice into action as they ate.

Doing well in school had long been something that brought Skye joy, and that morning xe discovered all xir hard work had paid off handsomely.

As soon as xe arrived Skye found a note in xir locker directing xem to see the principal. Xe immediately started to fret, wondering what xe had done wrong. *Did I forget about a school project? Were the pictures I took at the Cheerleading tournament to risqué!?*

When xe finally entered her office, Principal Early’s big bright smile put xem at ease. *Surely, she wouldn’t look that happy to see me if I was in trouble!*

“There’s my star!” she greeted xem “sit down, I’ve got wonderful news. The final stats are in for this semester, and it is my pleasure to tell you that you are our class Valedictorian – congratulations! You’ll need to prepare a speech to give to at graduation, but I don’t expect that to be a problem for you.” Skye could only manage to stammer out a stunned thanks as xe wondered what xe should say.

Skye was due at the paper for the last day of xir internship after school but xe squeezed a coffee meeting with Uncle Cullen in before xir shift.

Xe was dreading this conversation, but knew it was the right decision. “I’ve had a fantastic time helping you out with your blog” xe began “and thank you so much for the opportunity… but I feel like its time for me to move on. I’m hoping to transition to full-time work at the paper after today, and once I age up, I’ll be eligible to sign up with an agency as a freelance photographer, which I’ve always wanted to explore. I hope you understand.”

“Well, that makes this easy” Cullen smiled “I came here planning to tell you that I’ve decided to take the blog into semi-retirement. Angeles wants to see the nation and I’m going to shift the theme to a casual travel vlog. I was going to offer you an interview with my firm if you were interested, but it sounds like you have other plans.” The elderly sim rose to give his nephew a big hug.

“I’ll miss working with you. Good luck today, but don’t hesitate to call me if your plan runs into any snags, OK?” Skye nodded, returning their now frail seeming relative’s tight embrace before rushing off to finish out the final day of xir internship.

Skye’s interview went as well as xe’d hoped. “You’ve done great work here,” Ms. Baker told xem, “and we’d love to move you to a full-time position.”

“That would be fantastic!” Skye grinned as one of the biggest pieces of xir adult life plans fell into place. “Thank you!”

“My pleasure” Sigrid smiled “Its obvious that you love the culinary arts. I don’t have an opening for a dedicated food critic just now, but George is planning to retire as soon as he ages up and his job is yours assuming you keep up the good work. For now, we’ll keep you rotating around the whole local culture beat, filling in wherever we need an extra hand. Sound good?”

Note: these experiences aren’t cheap but 100% worth it!

1) Marbled and Fin - exceptional, exceptional restaurant. We thought the meal was a 10/10, blew Hall’s out of the water. Hall’s is the old school steakhouse that used to be the SPOT but seems to be losing its luster. Last time we were here we thought the quality had significantly decreased. 

2) Caviar Bar at Zero George  - what a cool experience! You get to eat delicious caviar and sit on the porch and bask in the beauty of an old Charleston home. It was Condé Nast’s top things to do in Charleston. 

3) Thoroughbred Club - have a drink at the bar in the Charleston place.  

4) HomeTeam Nachos - get the brisket on them. Woah. We think going to Sullivan’s island is fun so we usually go to that location, plus you can usually run into Shep from Southern Charm there. 

5) La Patesserie at Hotel Bennet has the best coffee & French pastries. Also excellent place to work. 

Ok I’m done. Enjoy Charleston!!

1ize13u,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ize13u/cured/,CURED!,"Hi Everybody,

I've been dealing with GERD for more than 15 years. I've tried everything, from tums to famotidine to PPIs (which I can't take, because they cause major stomach discomfort for me.) I like to eat and drink. I love coffee, spicy food, big meals, beer, wine, cocktails, cheese, chocolate: the good stuff! But I also try to be healthy and follow a keto / paleo diet as much as possible, keeping the grains and sugars to a minimum. But in general, I'd have probably 4-6 alcoholic drinks a week, and 3-4 nice (i.e. unhealthy) meals.

Anyway, after a recent trip to Mexico with family, I reached a breaking point with heartburn. The night before we left I was up all night wandering around the resort looking for tums. I eventually had to wake up a security guard to open the hotel store so I could buy some. It was embarrassing! I also was very worried about what all the reflux was doing to my throat / esophagus.

I was at the point where I was thinking maybe I should consider one of the surgeries, like fundoplication or something. But I talked to my brother-in-law, who is very into natural medicine and healthy living. He said before I consider surgery or even medicine, I should try going on a very strict elimination diet. He said try cutting out all grain, sugar, dairy, and alcohol for 6 weeks. So I figured I'd go for it. I also figured I'd try to help it out by not eating before bed. One around 10am and one around 5pm.

My friends, after \~2 weeks of this, I am CURED! My reflux has completely vanished, and I'm feeling great. Sleeping amazing. Stomach feels supple and healthy. I can't believe it!

It's of course a sacrifice. No wine at dinner. None of the foods I love like pasta, dessert, etc. I have still kept drinking coffee, which was a big trigger before, but I seem to be able to tolerate it. But feeling healthy and full of energy is totally worth it.

I'm 43, and I have two kids and one on the way. I feel like I've reached the point in my life where feeling good outweighs the thrill of having experiences with food and drink. So I think this may be a permanent change for me. But I'm writing this for others who are struggling. If you haven't tried a strict elimination diet (like Whole30) try it for a month or two. It feels really good to know that just eating healthy can get this condition under control.

Octopus Energy has won several awards, including the **uSwitch Energy Supplier of the Year 2023** award, and the **2023 Which? Recommended Provider Award.** They offer some of the best customer service, competitive prices and a lot of innovation.

**Energy Tariff’s**

Octopus Energy offers a range of energy tariffs, they have traditional tariffs available alongside a whole host of newer, more innovative tariffs.
If you are looking for a more traditional tariff, then Octopus currently have two available for new customers:
* **Loyal Octopus 16-month fixed:** This is a 12-month fixed rate tariff (currently only available for existing customers). It comes with 100% renewable electricity and no exit fees.
* **Flexible Octopus:** This is a variable rate tariff with 100% green electricity. No exit fees but the unit price could change over time.

Alongside these more traditional tariffs, Octopus has some more innovative tariffs available too:
* Outgoing Octopus
* Octopus Go
* Agile Octopus
* Octopus Tracker

If you are willing to switch to a non-traditional tariff, then the [**Octopus Tracker**](https://octopus.energy/smart/tracker/) tariff is generally considered to be the cheapest tariff available from any supplier

Octoplus is Octopus Energy’s new rewards scheme. It officially began in October last year, but it only launched some of the rewards in February 2024. 

It’s for customers with smart meters for making the grid greener. You can get access to free energy, get free coffee and discounted cinema tickets and earn “Octopoints” to spend on days out or exchange for account credit.

Lately, I got to review more than 10 different mug warmers, so I figured I’d share my findings to help anyone looking for one. If you like sipping coffee or tea at your desk but hate when it gets cold too fast, a mug warmer can be a good option. I decided to focus on mug warmer pads, and not the electric mugs which are less for desk and more relevant for on the go (also more expensive)

# What to Consider Before Buying:

* **Temperature Control** – Some warmers offer multiple heat settings, while others have a single temperature.
* **Auto Shut-Off** – A safety feature that turns off the warmer after a set time to prevent overheating.
* **Cup Compatibility** – Works best with flat-bottomed cups, but some support various materials like ceramic, glass, or stainless steel.
* **Heating Surface Size** – Larger surfaces can accommodate different cup sizes.
* **Design & Build** – Waterproof, durable, and aesthetic designs add convenience and style to your desk.

# Best Mug Warmers for Your Desk:

* **SEALON SLM02 Coffee Mug Warmer** *(Best Budget)* – Simple and stylish with three temperature settings and auto shut-off after 4 hours. The waterproof heating plate makes it easy to clean and durable.
* **SWEETFULL Coffee Mug Warmer** *(Best Value for Money)* – Features three temperature settings (105°F, 130°F, 180°F), a large heating panel, and a waterproof surface. Auto shut-off after 4 hours for safety.
* **KitchekShop Coffee Mug Warmer** *(Best with Timer)* – Offers four heat levels (131°F-185°F) and a timer that can be set from 1 to 12 hours. Comes with a stylish coaster for added convenience.
* **House Gem Mug Warmer** *(Best for Customization)* – Includes a 4-hour auto shut-off and a customizable timer (2-12 hours). The large heating surface ensures even warming, and the waterproof plate makes cleaning easy.

Check out this page for [more mug warmer pads](https://requiremints.com/guide/best-mug-warmers-pad/), there are helpful filters to find the right one for your budget and needs.

This has been so helpful so far this year to have a colour-coded tracker. Based off the temperature blanket idea I've seen on various crochet-related pages. DK yarn, 5mm hook, 2 rows of 14st double (single in US terms) crochet for each day. Forgive the scrappy edges and yet to figure out how to tidy up looped ends. Considering using alphabet beads or something to mark the months passing, new meds starting etc.

  
I'm also keeping track on a word document to share on video calls with the prescribing doctor.

Between the teal hook and yellow yarn is the period without new preventative (Aquipta/Quilpta/atogepant). I can see that it's helping I think. Less 5+ for sure. Two bad spells of attacks so far this year when I didn't have my preventative - felled probably by having a bad cold, then staying with family and drinking coffee instead of tea. Good evidence hopefully for being able to swap from private, out of pocket prescription to an NHS one when I see a neurologist in November.

  
Anyone else interested in trying this or having a go?



Key:

purple - red day, migraine pain level 5+, trouble functioning, having to retreat to dark room.

dark teal - orange day, migraine pain level 1-4, bothering me but can get on with life.

light teal - yellow day, no migraine pain but other symptoms - feeling of pressure in temple, fatigue, fog.

white - clear day, no migraine symptoms.

purple+dark teal mix - migraine with obvious aura, rare for me.

Now the hard part. You’ve got to plan something fun. So, what are your options? Try these five queer date ideas that just might help you land a second date.  
  
1. **Go to a Game**

Do you both have a shared love for the local sports team? Head to the nearest arena, ball park, or stadium and take in a game. It’s fun. It’s laid back. The two of you can bond over shared joy or frustration depending on the final score.

2. **Drag Brunch**

There are a few good reasons to pick this option. First, it’s a drag show with breakfast food and booze. What could be better than that? Also, like the saying goes, “Never waste a Friday night on a first date.” Even if things don't turn out, you’ll have the rest of your day to recover and go out with your friends later. 

3. **Bowling**

Corny? Maybe, but hear us out. It’s an activity, so you won’t feel pressured to keep up the conversation the entire time. But, it’s laid back enough that you can relax and chat between frames. Also, if you want to eat and drink on the cheap, you really can’t beat beer and nachos at the local bowling alley.

4. **Board Game Cafe**

Do you like to get your nerd on over DnD, Settlers of Catan, or a combative game of Uno? Bring your spirit for competition and your love of gaming. We love this fun alternative to bars or coffee shops because it adds something fun and interactive to the experience.

5. **Art Museum**

Get some culture as you connect with your newest mutual. Museums have such a cool vibe, and you can really get to know a person by seeing the art that resonates with them. Don't forget to grab lunch in the museum cafeteria or find a spot nearby to enjoy a picnic.

You have so many options! Why not impress your date by planning something thoughtful that shows you care. It’s one of the best ways to stand out in a sea of cookie cutter dates.",1,1740656608.0,u_Taimi_Queer_Dating,0,1.0,False

Nobody ever reaches out just to catch up over coffee or to genuinely see how I’m doing. The only time I get invited to things is when someone else ditches them last minute or when they need a favor. It’s like I exist only when I’m useful, but the moment I don’t serve a purpose, I’m forgotten.

You are welcome to [https://www.reddit.com/r/LudhianaCoffeeHouse/](https://www.reddit.com/r/LudhianaCoffeeHouse/), the community where we stay fit, stay caffeinated, and stay slightly obsessed with coffee.

**What’s the vibe?**

* **Weekend Runs**: Join us for real runs where we sweat it out so we can *earn* that post-run coffee. (Okay, fine, you don’t *have* to run to drink coffee, but it feels more heroic that way.)
* **Coffee Chats**: After the run, we geek out over brewing methods, share cafe recommendations, and argue about whether oat milk is a crime against humanity.
* **Fitness + Caffeine = Happiness**: Because nothing boosts mental and physical health like endorphins *and* espresso.

[$250],"I was ready to pull the trigger on a DF54 tonight when I realized it was now backordered until at least the end of March. I was gifted a used Breville DuoTemp Pro from a friend a few weeks ago and my old shitty $50 Cuisinart grinder isn’t just isn’t making an enjoyable cup of espresso most of the time. I am a grad student, so my budget is in the $200-250 range. I was pretty set on the DF54 but 5+ weeks of waiting is deterring me. It’s been frustrating not being able to fully dial in since even the finest grind setting is pulling sour shots. I am considering the eureka mingon manuale or baratza encore esp, but neither are as enticing as the DF54. I’m considering the DF64, but I really need to think about justifying twice the cost unless it’s truly twice the grinder. That being said, practically speaking I would rather buy a $400 grinder that will meet my needs for the foreseeable future than spend $200 on a grinder I am not happy with. I’m still not sure that’s in my current budget though. 

TLDR: should I
A. Chill out, drink drip coffee, and wait for DF54 restock
B. Stop overthinking and just get an alternative grinder because I’m tired of espresso tasting like it was filtered through satan’s ass
C. Save up, drink drip coffee, and convince my wife that the DF64 is truly twice the value and will be used for twice as long ",2,1740656215.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

1izdn5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1izdn5h/the_perfect_husband/,The Perfect husband,"My husband (M 34) and I (F 31) have been married for about 2.5 years now. Ours was an arranged marriage, finalized in July 2022. We first met about six months before the wedding when he and his parents visited my home. That initial meeting went well, he came across as intelligent, well-mannered, and responsible. My parents and I were quite impressed, not just with him but with his family as well.

He had a lot going for him, above-average looks, strong educational qualifications, and a well-paying job for his age. He had already bought a flat in the city (on loan, which he was managing himself), and his parents, both retired Class 1 government officials, had a stable financial background with pensions and multiple residential properties. Everything seemed right on paper, and more importantly, we genuinely liked each other.

With my parent’s approval, we decided to move forward. Over the next few months, we met regularly for dinners, coffee dates, long drives spending quality time together to understand each other better. Each meeting reinforced my decision to marry him. He was smart, kind, and thoughtful, and we shared similar views on career, family, and life in general. Our personalities aligned well, making the decision even easier.

During one of our conversations, we opened up about our past relationships. He told me he had one serious girlfriend back in college, but they broke up after graduation, and he had been single for the past eight years. In return, I shared that I had been in relationships with three guys before him (though, in reality that wasn’t the full truth).

As the wedding date approached, we both got busy with shopping and preparations, though we still made time to talk every night. The wedding itself was grand yet balanced, expenses were shared, and there were no gifts, dowry, or demands. After the celebrations, we moved into his flat, as his parents felt it was best for us to start our life together in our own home.

The first week of marriage was incredible. We were inseparable, growing closer physically, emotionally, and mentally. Every night, I made an effort to wear my best lingerie for him, which he absolutely adored. He was over the moon, and our sex life felt passionate and exciting. A week later, we left for our seven-day honeymoon in Bali. Unfortunately, he fell sick on the second day and remained unwell for the rest of the trip. Sex was out of the question, but he insisted I explore the island on my own while he rested in the hotel. When we returned home, it took some time for our intimacy to return to normal as he was still recovering. Over the next two months, life settled into a comfortable rhythm. Our sex life, which had slowed after the honeymoon mishap, gradually picked up again; from once a week to a more frequent 2-3 times a week.

Then came an unexpected surprise, we discovered I was already two months pregnant. Despite taking precautions, the news caught us off guard. However, the initial shock quickly turned into joy, and both our families were equally thrilled.

For the next five months, my husband was nothing short of amazing. He took complete care of me, always attentive and patient, handling my hormonal changes, mood swings, and body aches with unwavering support. However, this phase inevitably impacted our intimacy, reducing our sex life back to once a week.

In my seventh month of pregnancy, as is customary for many Indian women, I moved back to my parents' house for delivery and stayed there until our baby turned three months old. These five months created a significant gap in our physical relationship. There was no intimacy at all. Though he visited regularly and was a doting husband and father, the distance left me feeling a bit frustrated.

Once I returned home, life had shifted drastically from the time we had married just 11 months earlier. With a newborn, demanding jobs, household responsibilities, and a constant stream of relatives visiting to meet the baby, our sex life had come to a complete standstill.

This pattern continued for the next few months, with sex becoming almost nonexistent, and my frustration growing with each passing day. I confided in my girlfriends about it and started initiating intimacy more often, hoping to rekindle our connection. While he did respond to my advances, our encounters were brief and unsatisfying for me. His lack of enthusiasm and stamina only added to my frustration.

Despite this, I was certain he wasn’t having an affair. His phone was always unlocked, and I had checked it a few times, only to find nothing suspicious. He worked from home, and from 9 AM to 7 PM, he was right in front of me, busy with work. After that, he spent time playing with our daughter, helped me with dinner and tidying up, and we would take evening walks together before ending the day watching Netflix in bed.

Everything else in our life was perfect; he was a loving husband and a devoted father but the lack of intimacy was starting to take a toll on me. At times, I found myself growing irritated, frustrated, and even a little desperate. In an attempt to lighten my frustration, I would tease him with playful but crude remarks, joking about how I had never gone this long without an orgasm or how his dick seemed to have only one function (peeing). Sometimes, I’d even throw in exaggerated comments like needing to find a boyfriend. But instead of taking it seriously, he would just laugh it off, dismissing my words as harmless jokes. His reaction only made me feel more unheard, adding to my frustration.

I'm still unsure whether this was a calculated decision or simply a moment of impulsiveness driven by frustration and desperation. But at some point, I found myself responding to the memes my ex-boyfriends used to send me on Instagram. What started as harmless replies quickly escalated. Within a week, casual conversations turned into flirtatious exchanges, which soon evolved into explicit chats.

Last night, I told my husband I was going out for a much-needed girls’ night, leaving him at home to take care of our daughter. He didn’t question it, he never did trusting me completely as he kissed me goodbye and told me to have fun. But in reality, my plans were entirely different. Instead of meeting my friends, I went to see one of my exes. The anticipation had been building for days through flirtatious texts and suggestive conversations, and by the time we finally met, the tension between us was undeniable.

The moment we were alone, things escalated quickly. The way he looked at me, the way his hands explored my body, the way he made me feel desired, it was something I hadn’t felt in a long time. Every touch, every whisper, every kiss sent shivers down my spine. It wasn’t just about the physical act; it was the thrill, the excitement, the escape from the routine of my everyday life. For hours, we indulged in passion, completely lost in the moment. It was intoxicating, exhilarating, everything I had been craving but had denied myself for so long. I felt alive, desired, and completely free from the frustrations that had been eating away at me for months.

By the time it was over, my body was exhausted, yet a part of me didn’t want to leave. But I knew I had to. So, I gathered myself, fixed my hair and makeup, and left, heading home to the life I had momentarily stepped away from. As I walked through the door, my husband was fast asleep, our daughter peacefully tucked into her crib. Everything was exactly as I had left it, as if nothing had happened. Yet inside, I knew everything had changed.

1izdmng,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1izdmng/help_me/,help me,"Good morning everyone, I'm writing this post partly to vent, but mostly to ask for advice on how to deal with what's happening to me. I'm 38 years old, and for about three weeks now I've known that the woman I still consider my partner has been cheating on me for about eight months, and maybe she's still doing it, but let's take things one step at a time.

We've been together for 16 years, 10 of which we lived together. We've had our ups and downs, but I thought nothing serious. In recent years, due to various family and financial problems, we started arguing very frequently and with very heated tones, but despite everything, we were still in sync on many things. In the last two or three years, let's say since I got the new house, I've withdrawn into myself and started to care less and less about her. I didn't want to ask anyone for help, I had to get out of it on my own, or at least that's what I thought. The fact is that during some arguments I told her that I didn't feel anything for her anymore and that she could leave. I never really gave much weight to what I said until now. Over the months we drifted further and further apart, and last September after an argument she left for two weeks. She then came back saying she had family problems and couldn't stay there, I told her she could stay with me, convinced that the idea of leaving was a passing phase. It was a tough few months, and after the holidays, I started trying to mend the relationship. I don't know what happened to me, but spending the holidays alone made me realize how much I had hurt her and that despite everything I love her madly. On January 27th, after writing her a long message on WhatsApp telling her how important she was to me and that I had been a fool all this time, I desperately wanted to find a photo she had sent me, so since I couldn't find it on my phone I searched her old phone.

I turned white as a sheet when I saw things I never wanted to see, I had proof of her betrayal in my hands and the first date was June 2024.

Of course, you'll say that we broke up in September, but the evidence was from June, I died inside, especially because it happened with a mutual ""friend"". I called her and the only thing I could say was ""are you really with him?"". She understood immediately, she left work and came home to talk.

I may be a fool, but even before she crossed the threshold of the house I decided to forgive her. She probably didn't expect this reaction from me, so she was stunned when she heard that I love her and want her to stay with me.

We talked a lot in those days, and even though she was talking to me she kept writing on her phone. We had agreed that it was better for her to go to her parents, but she kept procrastinating. One evening the following week, after another message sent to him, I completely lost it, I snatched the phone out of her hands and told her that if she didn't let me read the chat I would keep her phone until I saw her at the door with her bags. Which is what happened.

Two days later at 5 am she came home drunk and freezing because she said she had fallen asleep in the car. I let her in, warmed her up, and the next morning we talked again.

The following Friday I invited her to see a concert, we went together, we danced, laughed, joked, cried, rubbed against each other, then we went home and fell asleep.

The next morning I told her again to come back and she kept saying I don't know.

Sunday morning at 8 am I found a call from her, she had gotten drunk again, made a mess, told me she had called both me and him and other friends but no one answered, that she had gone to the bar in town where a friend of hers gave her the keys to her house to go to sleep there. In the afternoon she came by the house, told me she was a fool, that she couldn't handle herself, that that morning she had actually only called me and that she felt relaxed and calm at home with me. We took a shower together and went out.

The next day we had an introductory meeting for couples therapy (even though we're not a couple at the moment) with two similar but different goals. I wanted to fix everything, she wanted to figure out what to do because she feels lost and wants to understand how we got to this point.

During the meeting we clarified some points, I understood what had pushed her away and what had made her suffer, and she told me she doesn't know if she wants to come back because she's afraid everything will go back to the way it was before.

A week goes by and it's Valentine's Day. I stupidly send her flowers, writing on the card whatever happens you're important and I thank you for the good times we've had together, I later learned from a friend that she didn't like them and that she felt ""trapped"".

Now, the town is next to Milan, but since we've lived together so far we have mutual friends and acquaintances, so we see each other often whether we want to or not.

On Saturday I asked her to come over for coffee, yesterday she wrote to me and came over and we talked all afternoon. She told me she doesn't know if she should say yes or no because sometimes she thinks about him...

In the evening we went to see a light and sound installation, as soon as we entered the first installation I was about to turn around and leave, it was beautiful but too, too romantic, and turning around I saw her in tears, I hugged her and she said ""it reminds me of Holland, we were so happy then"".

I always try to talk to her to ""convince"" her, but she keeps telling me she doesn't want to think about this now, that she needs her time.

Let's be clear, I love her and I want her to come back to me, she tells me she doesn't feel the same way she used to, but that she still feels affection, I asked her if it's the same affection you feel for a brother and she said no, more.

I'm only in the 4th day of no contact and i'm going crazy.... help me!",1,1740655766.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

For the next five months, my husband was nothing short of amazing. He took complete care of me, always attentive and patient, handling my hormonal changes, mood swings, and body aches with unwavering support. However, this phase inevitably impacted our intimacy, reducing our sex life back to once a week.

In my seventh month of pregnancy, as is customary for many Indian women, I moved back to my parents' house for delivery and stayed there until our baby turned three months old. These five months created a significant gap in our physical relationship. There was no intimacy at all. Though he visited regularly and was a doting husband and father, the distance left me feeling a bit frustrated.

Once I returned home, life had shifted drastically from the time we had married just 11 months earlier. With a newborn, demanding jobs, household responsibilities, and a constant stream of relatives visiting to meet the baby, our sex life had come to a complete standstill.

This pattern continued for the next few months, with sex becoming almost nonexistent, and my frustration growing with each passing day. I confided in my girlfriends about it and started initiating intimacy more often, hoping to rekindle our connection. While he did respond to my advances, our encounters were brief and unsatisfying for me. His lack of enthusiasm and stamina only added to my frustration.

Despite this, I was certain he wasn’t having an affair. His phone was always unlocked, and I had checked it a few times, only to find nothing suspicious. He worked from home, and from 9 AM to 7 PM, he was right in front of me, busy with work. After that, he spent time playing with our daughter, helped me with dinner and tidying up, and we would take evening walks together before ending the day watching Netflix in bed.

Everything else in our life was perfect; he was a loving husband and a devoted father but the lack of intimacy was starting to take a toll on me. At times, I found myself growing irritated, frustrated, and even a little desperate. In an attempt to lighten my frustration, I would tease him with playful but crude remarks, joking about how I had never gone this long without an orgasm or how his dick seemed to have only one function (peeing). Sometimes, I’d even throw in exaggerated comments like needing to find a boyfriend. But instead of taking it seriously, he would just laugh it off, dismissing my words as harmless jokes. His reaction only made me feel more unheard, adding to my frustration.

I'm still unsure whether this was a calculated decision or simply a moment of impulsiveness driven by frustration and desperation. But at some point, I found myself responding to the memes my ex-boyfriends used to send me on Instagram. What started as harmless replies quickly escalated. Within a week, casual conversations turned into flirtatious exchanges, which soon evolved into explicit chats.

Last night, I told my husband I was going out for a much-needed girls’ night, leaving him at home to take care of our daughter. He didn’t question it, he never did trusting me completely as he kissed me goodbye and told me to have fun. But in reality, my plans were entirely different. Instead of meeting my friends, I went to see one of my exes. The anticipation had been building for days through flirtatious texts and suggestive conversations, and by the time we finally met, the tension between us was undeniable.

The moment we were alone, things escalated quickly. The way he looked at me, the way his hands explored my body, the way he made me feel desired, it was something I hadn’t felt in a long time. Every touch, every whisper, every kiss sent shivers down my spine. It wasn’t just about the physical act; it was the thrill, the excitement, the escape from the routine of my everyday life. For hours, we indulged in passion, completely lost in the moment. It was intoxicating, exhilarating, everything I had been craving but had denied myself for so long. I felt alive, desired, and completely free from the frustrations that had been eating away at me for months.

By the time it was over, my body was exhausted, yet a part of me didn’t want to leave. But I knew I had to. So, I gathered myself, fixed my hair and makeup, and left, heading home to the life I had momentarily stepped away from. As I walked through the door, my husband was fast asleep, our daughter peacefully tucked into her crib. Everything was exactly as I had left it, as if nothing had happened. Yet inside, I knew everything had changed.

Combine it with Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge. Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts´.",1,1740655544.0,awakened,2,1.0,False

Is it a good sign?,"I \[21F\] play in a band, i met him \[23M\] through a trip - he is the best friend of the bassist. After the trip, he invited me out. We had several dates, but i felt our conversations are dull and dead ends many times, despite the physical attraction i had for him. I had to say no to him, i liked me alot at the time. Then we stay friends for the next 1 year.

About my background: i’m a designer, really curious about the world, thirst of knowledge, love to talk and have long, deep conversation with people about anything. I used to date artistic guys, who can talk with me for hours about things, and made me feel like we can do anything together - but after sometimes go by, they always avoidant and lost the feeling and break up with me. I realize i was attracted to avoidant and charming men, i get used to fast and butterflies relationships. I listen more than i see the true actions of people, naive and too easy to believe people. My topics i care about: art, social problems like women rights, philosophy questions,… I like reading books and listen to yapping videos about a specific topic and podcasts that 2 human talk about things.

About his background: he’s an architecture, really good at math, chemistry and physics at school, but not a type of so obssess and really interested in those subjects, just really good at it. He thinks more in a practical way, thinks about solving problems in daily life, he is truely a problem solver. He is not so curious about things that dont serve him in practical ways, not the kind of asking questions about everything in life. He does have some of his interest that he really dives deep into: coffee, satorial dressing, and playing guitar and listen to music. He is really responsible in many things, and work hard at work, pursue more and higher, has knowledge about finacial. Really calm and stoic, in the way that i find many older people can not keep calm and solve problems like he does.

After one year of being friends, i observe him as a human, not a potential lover. We had other bf/gf during that time but not too long period of time. We share a great dark humour, can joke many things with each other. I still find him attractive, really like the stoic trait of him. I ask him sometimes about buying a motorcycle (he is really interested in this topic also), and i finally buy a new one for traveling (i’m really interested in traveling). I always find him attractive, but i just thoight that “nah, he can’t be my boyfriend” because i have only one type of “being interesting” kind of person: conversationalist, curious like me, have to care about art, have to be hard to guess, have to be adventurous, have to be like this like that,… I used to had such a narrow view about interesting humans.But 5 months ago, he asked me out for normal coffee talking. I talked much more than he talks, but i did find myself really comfortable near him, and when i sat next to him, i had to write to my journey 5 A4 pages to convince myself not to like him, because i felt the chemistry so strong! And for the next two months, we hanged out every sunday, but its kinda on and off feeling i had, same problem 1 year ago that he is a quite dude and i felt like i had to carry the conversation. But the trust rising up, and we spend time on doing different things besides just talking: going to galleries, going out coffee with the whole band,… I like him, but he doesn’t fit my “type” of interesting person. I do find him cute and really menly to me (i really like Johnny Depp and he has the same style and trait like Johnny Depp too. Also looks like my dad - had beard and “hairy” features). I keep observing him, and really admire his calm and solving in many problems. We do like jokes too. I think i had great time, but not like the “so so interesting guy”. One time i confronted him about this: Are we friends or something more? I dont like being this way. What will other friends in the band think about this? That day we promised to keep space between us, but we a bit drunk and kissed each other and huged each other dearly. I likeed him, but just felt off a bit about the talking thing. But after that day, we couldn’t keep promise, and going out more and more! And we confronted about our feelings for each other, and had sex for the first time. And things went on, 2 months after the first coffee we confronted feelings and had sex, and 1 and a half month after first sex, we are official bf and [gf. At](http://gf.At) first, i felt really frustrated about the situation. I hate to cary the whole conversation, and we had long silence times. I had to talk to him about it, i send a long Notion note for him: what is so amazing about this relationship, and the need for deep coversations and explore the wolrd of mine. I believe at that time i didn’t understand fully of my need, just know that “ah, this person wants to talk more”. I thought about this problem so much that i felt i was going to explode (i’m a panic and overthinking person). 3 months from the day i sent him that note, after days and hours i told him in details about what i talk to other conversationalist friends (he listens carefully), finally yesterday i said he understood the need of mine now. He said he was worrying that he is not interesting enough for me, that he is not a “knowledge guy” to speak to me. I said to him now after meeting you and the band (the guys in band share a dark humour too, and they all have normal works at daytime not related to art, not a dreamer like me and taught me many interesting things about life - changed my point of view about “interesting” of mine), i saw other important traits in a human, and love is so much more than just vibing in conversations. I said he calms me down by his wise advise after listeing carefully to my problems, is the sweetest guy i have ever been with, despite being a logical guy, he is still a very emotional and loving guy. This point suits me well, because i am a very emotional person, i feel like he can understand deeply at times i break down and cry about things. And why i dont love those conversationalist friends? And all the “knowledge old guys” i have met? Because love is so much more than those surface things! We almost cried last night through video call.

The best thing is, i saw a progress. For some times, i “scratch the right spot” of him, and he gives me his points of view about topics i dont usually talk about. He really wants to talk, but naturally he listens more. He only joins on topics that he knows about. I can teach him how to make questions about everything and keep the conversation flowing, even in topics we dont know. I can choose a randow topic to start, because he said he finds it hard to just start randomly.

But i’m just worry about it, and he also. We do need more time to understand each other more. I will be happy if anyone can share their similar stories, and advices for me. I truely want to fight for this relationship, i think it’s worth it.

He really wants to talk, but naturally he listens more. He only joins on topics that he knows about. I can teach him how to make questions about everything and keep the conversation flowing, even in topics we dont know. I can choose a randow topic to start, because he said he finds it hard to just start randomly.

**Why Am I Feeling So Drained?**  
  
You’re late to the office or hospital or school or collage or any place where you wat to go. You’re chasing a packed bus or a metro, barely noticing you’ve been drenched in sweat. All of a sudden, you feel lightheaded, your legs feel wobbly, and there’s a strange wave of exhaustion hitting you. You took the bottle of water from your bag and gulped a long sip of water, but it doesn't seem to help much. What's happening?  
  
There’s a huge chance your body is screaming out for electrolytes - The essential minerals that keep your energy level stable but don't come with bottled water. And this is where [**Electral ORS Powder**](https://www.electral.co.in/products.php?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=ORS+Powder&utm_term=ors&utm_content=Electral+ORS+Powder) (Oral Rehydration Solution) comes in. it's not just about drinking water but about replenishing what your body has lost. Maybe it's due to extreme heat, long workouts, sickness or even fasting. It's true that dehydration leads to weakness and ORS is the quickest way to bounce back.  
  
**How Weakness Creeps up on you?**  
  
**Dehydration**   
After spending hours outdoors or commuting without sufficient water intake, your body starts losing fluids, leading to low blood pressure, fatigue and dizziness. Electral ORS helps by restoring the lost sodium, potassium  and glucose, ensuring your body absorbs water more effectively.  
  
**Post workout fatigue**  
Ever felt completely drained after an intense workout or a running session. Sweating excessively causes a drop in energy resulting in loss of electrolytes.  
  
**Weakness due to illness**  
Fever, diarrhea, or vomiting can rapidly deplete essential minerals, making you feel weak and dizzy. That’s why doctors often recommend ORS during stomach infections or viral fevers—because it helps your body retain fluids and recover faster.  
  
**Fasting & Low Energy Levels**  
Ever skipped meals or fasted and suddenly felt sluggish? It’s because of low electrolyte levels. A quick glass of Electral ORS can help stabilize your blood sugar and keep you feeling active without breaking your fast.

[ORS Powder for energy](https://preview.redd.it/b827z6a11ole1.jpg?width=1255&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a5245c5584af7e3b47ce38a7b5b81bc65c18e99)

WHO-recommended formula for rapid hydration and energy restoration, making ORS the most effective solution when you’re feeling drained. 

**When to Take Electral ORS Powder**

·        After workouts or outdoor activities. Intense workout results in dehydration and muscle cramps

·        During illness or fever. High fever sometimes can lead you to vomiting, diarrhoea

·        While traveling: Long flights, road trips, and humid climates can leave you exhausted.

**The Bottom Line -  A Simple Fix for Everyday Weakness**

Weakness can hit when you least expect it. The good news? It takes just one glass of Electral ORS to get back on your feet. So, the next time you feel drained, don’t just grab a random energy drink or coffee. Give your body what it really needs—instant rehydration with Electral ORS.

Here is the progress. Is it a good sign?,"I \[21F\] play in a band, i met him \[23M\] through a trip - he is the best friend of the bassist. After the trip, he invited me out. We had several dates, but i felt our conversations are dull and dead ends many times, despite the physical attraction i had for him. I had to say no to him, i liked me alot at the time. Then we stay friends for the next 1 year.   
  
About my background: i’m a designer, really curious about the world, thirst of knowledge, love to talk and have long, deep conversation with people about anything. I used to date artistic guys, who can talk with me for hours about things, and made me feel like we can do anything together - but after sometimes go by, they always avoidant and lost the feeling and break up with me. I realize i was attracted to avoidant and charming men, i get used to fast and butterflies relationships. I listen more than i see the true actions of people, naive and too easy to believe people. My topics i care about: art, social problems like women rights, philosophy questions,… I like reading books and listen to yapping videos about a specific topic and podcasts that 2 human talk about things.  
  
About his background: he’s an architecture, really good at math, chemistry and physics at school, but not a type of so obssess and really interested in those subjects, just really good at it. He thinks more in a practical way, thinks about solving problems in daily life, he is truely a problem solver. He is not so curious about things that dont serve him in practical ways, not the kind of asking questions about everything in life. He does have some of his interest that he really dives deep into: coffee, satorial dressing, and playing guitar and listen to music. He is really responsible in many things, and work hard at work, pursue more and higher, has knowledge about finacial. Really calm and stoic, in the way that i find many older people can not keep calm and solve problems like he does.   
  
After one year of being friends, i observe him as a human, not a potential lover. We had other bf/gf during that time but not too long period of time. We share a great dark humour, can joke many things with each other. I still find him attractive, really like the stoic trait of him. I ask him sometimes about buying a motorcycle (he is really interested in this topic also), and i finally buy a new one for traveling (i’m really interested in traveling). I always find him attractive, but i just thoight that “nah, he can’t be my boyfriend” because i have only one type of “being interesting” kind of person: conversationalist, curious like me, have to care about art, have to be hard to guess, have to be adventurous, have to be like this like that,… I used to had such a narrow view about interesting humans.But 5 months ago, he asked me out for normal coffee talking. I talked much more than he talks, but i did find myself really comfortable near him, and when i sat next to him, i had to write to my journey 5 A4 pages to convince myself not to like him, because i felt the chemistry so strong! And for the next two months, we hanged out every sunday, but its kinda on and off feeling i had, same problem 1 year ago that he is a quite dude and i felt like i had to carry the conversation. But the trust rising up, and we spend time on doing different things besides just talking: going to galleries, going out coffee with the whole band,… I like him, but he doesn’t fit my “type” of interesting person. I do find him cute and really menly to me (i really like Johnny Depp and he has the same style and trait like Johnny Depp too. Also looks like my dad - had beard and “hairy” features). I keep observing him, and really admire his calm and solving in many problems. We do like jokes too. I think i had great time, but not like the “so so interesting guy”. One time i confronted him about this: Are we friends or something more? I dont like being this way. What will other friends in the band think about this? That day we promised to keep space between us, but we a bit drunk and kissed each other and huged each other dearly. I likeed him, but just felt off a bit about the talking thing. But after that day, we couldn’t keep promise, and going out more and more! And we confronted about our feelings for each other, and had sex for the first time. And things went on, 2 months after the first coffee we confronted feelings and had sex, and 1 and a half month after first sex, we are official bf and [gf.At](http://gf.At) first, i felt really frustrated about the situation. I hate to cary the whole conversation, and we had long silence times. I had to talk to him about it, i send a long Notion note for him: what is so amazing about this relationship, and the need for deep coversations and explore the wolrd of mine. I believe at that time i didn’t understand fully of my need, just know that “ah, this person wants to talk more”. I thought about this problem so much that i felt i was going to explode (i’m a panic and overthinking person). 3 months from the day i sent him that note, after days and hours i told him in details about what i talk to other conversationalist friends (he listens carefully), finally yesterday i said he understood the need of mine now. He said he was worrying that he is not interesting enough for me, that he is not a “knowledge guy” to speak to me. I said to him now after meeting you and the band (the guys in band share a dark humour too, and they all have normal works at daytime not related to art, not a dreamer like me and taught me many interesting things about life - changed my point of view about “interesting” of mine), i saw other important traits in a human, and love is so much more than just vibing in conversations. I said he calms me down by his wise advise after listeing carefully to my problems, is the sweetest guy i have ever been with, despite being a logical guy, he is still a very emotional and loving guy. This point suits me well, because i am a very emotional person, i feel like he can understand deeply at times i break down and cry about things. And why i dont love those conversationalist friends? And all the “knowledge old guys” i have met? Because love is so much more than those surface things! We almost cried last night through video call.

1izdf0s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1izdf0s/my_story_with_gastritis_so_far/,My Story with Gastritis so far.,"Hey all! 

Here to share my story with Gastritis so far, hope it’s useful to someone. Otherwise, maybe it’ll at least be a little therapeutic to me. 

I’m 26 years old. I mostly work night shifts. My diet has always been generally ok, besides consuming at least one energy drink and cup of coffee per day, and I’ve always been pretty active. Not a drinker, at all really, but I’m thinking this story may have started with a wedding in September in which I had binged way too much to drink on an empty stomach. It probably doesn’t help that I’m a cop, and so my eating schedule varies so much depending on calls. I used to eat a large breakfast before shift, mostly fast during, and then have a small dinner before bed. I can’t do that anymore without painful bloating. 

I first noticed symptoms in October which gradually increased from annoying in November, to life debilitating in December. These mainly presented themselves as constant 10/10 nausea and a dull constant 4/10 pain on the left side of my abdomen. I could hardly do anything because I felt like throwing up. There was some delay in figuring out the cause, a newly discovered abdominal lipoma just below my left ribs led to a misdiagnosis of a hernia before scans cleared that up, but eventually we narrowed down that the pain was my stomach. 

In January, I was tested for Celia’s Disease and H. Pylori. Both tests were negative. The doctor then advised me it was likely a stomach ulcer or gastritis and put me on a PPI to see if it made a difference. By February, my symptoms seemed to have cleared up completely besides some minor discomfort in my stomach. I stopped the PPI and celebrated the next day with pizza and a cup of coffee. 

Big mistake. 

It was like instant acid reflux. My stomach has never hurt so bad. Back on PPI for a week now, and I’ve only partially clawed back that progress. They seem less effective this time. I’m so nauseous all the time, but at least the pain and discomfort has decreased after learning here I needed to stop with the caffeine. Now I’d say I’m at 5/10 nausea and 2/10 pain. Who knew coffee - my safety blanket - was causing so much of the trouble.

Almost out of PPI’s and not sure if I should go to the doctor again for more, or just wean myself off and focus on bland dietary changes. I’ll probably try the latter, before doing the former if it gets worse again. The doctor said if it continued, they were going to do a gastroscopy. I’m kind of scared of that. Also, these PPI’s seem to be making me more constipated and bloat easier…which seems to be a problem in its own right. 

I ordered some of the supplements recommended in here to try when they arrive. I also bought some Matuka honey and have been drinking it dissolved in hot water. That and a warm bath before going to sleep have been a lifesaver. Though, I’m still struggling to get enough rest. 

Hope you guys are doing well.

This shit sucks my dudes. 

Hopefully someday soon - the left rib pain, the nausea, and the gurgling tummy will go away.

1izdeff,https://www.reddit.com/r/vajrayana/comments/1izdeff/adhd_medication_and_practice/,"ADHD, medication, and Practice.","Hi, 

Thank you for taking the time, firstly. 
I am a long time practitioner who has come to realize I have ADHD as someone in their early thirties. I didn’t realize I’ve been self medicating for it for most of my life since I was 14 with drinking copious amounts of coffee every day up till now. I realize now that coffee is not a good means to deal with this, but feel extremely hesitant to talk to a doctor about medication even though I know it could change my life tremendously. I am just seeing if anyone else is a practitioner working with an ADHD diagnosis and how their teachers view western medicines such as ADHD medicines.

One of my teachers spoke out against antidepressants, but said some people really do need them. Some teachers have said medication can be like glasses for your eyes, why would you feel badly or ashamed about needing them? For background, I was a heavy daily drug user from 14 years old doing lots of cocaine, acid, mushrooms, weed, uppers, downers, and whatever I could get my hands on until senior year when I went through an extremely traumatic life situation and found the dharma to take refuge in instead of drugs and a chaotic lifestyle.

Studies now show that brain development with early heavy drug use contributes heavily to certain mental disorders and I very much relate to that. My brain didn’t develop the right receptors properly to work with natural neurochemicals because of my heavy cocaine use as a kid, for example. I was on antidepressants for 10 years but I stopped taking them almost two years ago because I felt immense shame and guilt around them, like I was a fake practitioner for taking a drug that distanced me from my emotions. I am worried about other medications that could have a seriously positive impact on my life in a relative sense, but I feel afraid they might impact my ability to embody the dharma fully because they’ll act as a veil and crutch. But I yearn to just feel like I can get through my day doing basic tasks others seem to have no difficulty with around me, and keep my dharma practice consistent as well.

I don’t have access to any of my teachers at the moment due to logistical constraints but am reaching out to one who is both a Chinese Medicine and Tibetan Medicine practitioner to hear their opinion. I just thought this could be a beneficial inquiry in this sub not just for myself, but for others also struggling with these issues on the path.

I apologize for my long windedness and any way my inquiry comes off as naive or unclear. Thanks again to the greater Vajra Sangha here.",2,1740654841.0,vajrayana,2,1.0,False

This makes me wonder- why such a big difference if the seller in Amazon is the brand itself?

Some explanations:
1. Website premium? Are they charging extra for direct sales while giving discount on ecom like amazon?
2. Quality difference? Is the product sold on Amazon from a diff batch, older stock or a lower quality variant?
3. Unfair pricing? If both products are same, why charge loyal customers more?

Also, Rs 972 for 210g of protein seems expensive compared to other clearn protein brands. Are we just paying for branding?

1izddra,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhysicalProductMgmt/comments/1izddra/passive_tech_vs_active_tech_which_is_better_for/,Passive tech vs Active tech - which is better for physical products?,"Mind you - this is a personal definition i use to help identify what works and what doesn't.

In the world of consumer products we usually have two ways to tackle a very specific pain point through innovation.

Active tech and passive tech.

  
Active tech are components that actively need energy to solve a specific problem

For example: say that you want to come up with a way for a mug or bottle to hold onto a surface of a table to prevent spillage 

active component would be a motorized base that creates a pressure difference that allows said mug to hold onto the surface. 

This would require - moving parts (motor), active power supply (battery) and electronics to regulate.

inconvenience would be to charge the mug or bottle before use.

convenience is a suction that will rarely fail when using.

But naturally one would realize the expense per product that comes with adding so much complication to solve a simple problem as opposed to the following passive approach 

https://preview.redd.it/fvl915prtnle1.png?width=183&format=png&auto=webp&s=4ec3a60f0f41967ec82692740658fd4981d28314

passive technology - that uses no external power source to solve a specific pain point. this could be mostly mechanical (analogue) but one could also achieve the same through material science.

Outcome can be unreliable sometimes and may not be as great as active tech. 

for example: suction power of a active solution will be much higher than passive. but as long as its within the boundaries of what is needed it would be fine. 

If the passive suction is enough to get the job done why would you need to over engineer a mug than can have the suction power to lift a table.

lets call this - **boundary of practicality.**

so would this mean that passive will always do the job? 

for the same consumer product let us now try and solve another problem - warming up a cup of tea.

https://preview.redd.it/42wgol4munle1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=d746f2f1679f60670b97b7823a918c5272924fe7

This uses induction current to pass through a base active circuit which will heat up the liquid inside the mug. the base has a battery as well allowing the mug to continue heating up its liquids even when its off the charging plate.

this concept of heating the liquid is very difficult to achieve through passive tech. one can argue about using passive insulation but that will only provide a sustainable way of keeping something warm but warming up actively.

is the self heating mug expensive? definitely 

is it a need? - very subjective 

but the underlying truth is that a passive solution will not work in this case. 

to help understand what to select will boil down to one thing - is your problem going to solve a volume driven idea?

you cant scale active technology very easily. it is expensive.

if volume is not a concern and you are tackling a niche market - hence active will work.

But you dont always need squeeze as much active technology onto a consumer product to gain the attention of the market.

there are plenty out there that works just fine by performing around passive concepts.

you need to be creative in ways to achieve the same if not better experience passively.

for this you need to first understand the pain point. 

sometimes customers think they need something until it is presented to them.

if the problem can be twisted around a passive solution you might be able to gain attention in your own unique way while pushing volume driven concepts.

Because at the end of the day consumers are overwhelmed by every aspect having to be included with active components so why bother remembering to charge your coffee mug before making coffee if you can find a way to prolong open mug insulation so much so the duration of the warm coffee it is within the **boundary of practicality**

I always find him attractive, but i just thoight that “nah, he can’t be my boyfriend” because i have only one type of “being interesting” kind of person: conversationalist, curious like me, have to care about art, have to be hard to guess, have to be adventurous, have to be like this like that,… I used to had such a narrow view about interesting humans.But 5 months ago, he asked me out for normal coffee talking. I talked much more than he talks, but i did find myself really comfortable near him, and when i sat next to him, i had to write to my journey 5 A4 pages to convince myself not to like him, because i felt the chemistry so strong! And for the next two months, we hanged out every sunday, but its kinda on and off feeling i had, same problem 1 year ago that he is a quite dude and i felt like i had to carry the conversation. But the trust rising up, and we spend time on doing different things besides just talking: going to galleries, going out coffee with the whole band,… I like him, but he doesn’t fit my “type” of interesting person. I do find him cute and really menly to me (i really like Johnny Depp and he has the same style and trait like Johnny Depp too. Also looks like my dad - had beard and “hairy” features). I keep observing him, and really admire his calm and solving in many problems. We do like jokes too. I think i had great time, but not like the “so so interesting guy”. One time i confronted him about this: Are we friends or something more? I dont like being this way. What will other friends in the band think about this? That day we promised to keep space between us, but we a bit drunk and kissed each other and huged each other dearly. I likeed him, but just felt off a bit about the talking thing. But after that day, we couldn’t keep promise, and going out more and more! And we confronted about our feelings for each other, and had sex for the first time. And things went on, 2 months after the first coffee we confronted feelings and had sex, and 1 and a half month after first sex, we are official bf and gf .At first, i felt really frustrated about the situation. I hate to cary the whole conversation, and we had long silence times. I had to talk to him about it, i send a long Notion note for him: what is so amazing about this relationship, and the need for deep coversations and explore the wolrd of mine. I believe at that time i didn’t understand fully of my need, just know that “ah, this person wants to talk more”. I thought about this problem so much that i felt i was going to explode (i’m a panic and overthinking person). 3 months from the day i sent him that note, after days and hours i told him in details about what i talk to other conversationalist friends (he listens carefully), finally yesterday i said he understood the need of mine now. He said he was worrying that he is not interesting enough for me, that he is not a “knowledge guy” to speak to me. I said to him now after meeting you and the band (the guys in band share a dark humour too, and they all have normal works at daytime not related to art, not a dreamer like me and taught me many interesting things about life - changed my point of view about “interesting” of mine), i saw other important traits in a human, and love is so much more than just vibing in conversations. I said he calms me down by his wise advise after listeing carefully to my problems, is the sweetest guy i have ever been with, despite being a logical guy, he is still a very emotional and loving guy. This point suits me well, because i am a very emotional person, i feel like he can understand deeply at times i break down and cry about things. And why i dont love those conversationalist friends? And all the “knowledge old guys” i have met? Because love is so much more than those surface things! We almost cried last night through video call. We love each other.  
  
The best thing is, i saw a progress. For some times, i “scratch the right spot” of him, and he gives me his points of view about topics i dont usually talk about. He really wants to talk, but naturally he listens more. He only joins on topics that he knows about. I can teach him how to make questions about everything and keep the conversation flowing, even in topics we dont know. I can choose a randow topic to start, because he said he finds it hard to just start randomly.   
  
But i’m just worry about it, and he also. We do need more time to understand each other more. I will be happy if anyone can share their similar stories, and advices for me. I truely want to fight for this relationship, i think it’s worth it. We met each other’s family already, and his family is really sweet and wholesome to me, i see a future with him.",0,1740654599.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False

Additionally I have had past relationships (which in themselves have fucked me up) and also was a bit of a stoner early on in my adult life, recently I have managed to turn my life completely around, home, car, decent job, only addiction I have left is to coffee.

For a long time I have had feelings for her, wanted to take of and protect her, but only recently did I stop explaining it away as my trauma talking or its cause I was high.

However around the same time we started to hang out again she has started dating this guy that’s over 10 years older than her, which add to a pile of reasons I don’t like him, but in the interest of supporting her and being a good friend will always offer a different point of view because I want her to be happy.

Only I’m concerned I am justifying his behavior to her at times because I’m too afraid to tell her how I feel and losing her, or worse she feels the same way and I can’t be the partner she deserves

She had just moved into a new apartment, excited to start fresh, and the living room was the first to be furnished.

She had spent hours scrolling through online stores, picking out the perfect couch, coffee table, and a couple of elegant chairs. They arrived the next morning, delivered straight to her door, and as she unwrapped the plastic, she couldn’t help but feel a little giddy.

The couch was soft and inviting, with plush cushions she imagined sinking into after a long day. She eagerly flopped down onto it, testing it out with the enthusiasm of a kid jumping into a pile of leaves. But just as she settled in, she heard a creak—and then a loud snap.

Amberlynn froze. The couch shifted under her, and she felt a sharp lurch. With wide eyes, she looked down to see a deep indentation where the frame had buckled beneath her weight. The upholstery was fine, but the structure had betrayed her.

""Great,"" she muttered, standing up and inspecting the damage. A small piece of wood had cracked beneath the cushion.

Not wanting to admit defeat, she quickly moved on to the coffee table—a sleek, modern piece she thought would be the perfect addition. She set her drink down on it while reaching for her phone. As she leaned forward to check a message, she accidentally bumped the table, sending it rocking.

Before she could react, the table wobbled one last time and—CRASH—it tipped over completely, the glass top shattering into tiny shards across the floor. Amberlynn stood in stunned silence for a moment before sighing.

""Well, at least I'm not bored today,"" she said, already plotting how to salvage her furniture situation. This new place might have its challenges, but it wouldn’t break her spirit—or, in this case, her furniture.",0,1740654076.0,Amberverse__,2,0.18,False

1izd6fn,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1izd6fn/drifting_in_stillness/,Drifting in Stillness,"The house breathed around her—air conditioning humming, floorboards creaking in the distance, the faint rustling of wind against the windows. It was alive in the way a home should be, filled with warmth and movement, but Valyria felt none of it. She sat curled into the couch, her body heavy, her limbs lax, as if gravity had become too strong for her alone.

Her gaze drifted over the living room, but nothing truly registered. The folded blanket draped over the armchair. The half-drunk cup of tea on the coffee table, the liquid inside gone cold hours ago. The dim afternoon light filtering through the curtains, casting lazy golden patterns on the floor. It was all there, familiar and real, but she felt as though she were watching a painting of her own life rather than living inside it.

She should get up. Should gather the laundry, reply to messages, make dinner before the kids started asking what they were eating tonight. Should, should, should. The word echoed inside her like a demand, but her body refused to obey.

A deep breath filled her lungs, but it didn’t feel like it belonged to her. She ran her fingers over the fabric of her leggings, tracing the texture as if to remind herself that she was real, that her body was here, even if her mind was not. But even that felt distant, like touching something through layers of silk.

She could hear the children playing down the hall—soft giggles, the rhythmic thud of little feet against the floor. That sound, at least, reached her in some small way. It was tethered to her, even through the haze. She knew she would answer them if they needed her. Knew she would move if necessity forced her to. But right now, sitting here, lost in this stillness, nothing else seemed to matter.

Her phone buzzed on the cushion beside her, the vibration rattling against the fabric like a distant echo. She glanced at it, her vision slow to focus. A message. Probably from Ronan. He would be checking in, asking how her day was going.

She should answer. Should type out a quick I’m fine, just tired. He would believe it, because she said it so often that even she almost believed it sometimes.

But the thought of lifting her hands, of forming words, felt impossible.

She closed her eyes instead, willing the moment to pass.

She wasn’t sad. Not really. Not in the way that brought tears or aching sorrow. It was something else—something hollow. Like she had stepped outside of herself, watching her life through glass, able to see everything but unable to feel it.

She missed feeling.

Missed the way warmth used to settle in her chest when Ronan kissed her before leaving for work. Missed the way the kids’ laughter used to be enough to fill her heart. Missed the quiet joy of sipping tea and actually tasting it instead of just drinking it out of routine.

When had it changed? When had everything begun to slip just far enough away that she could no longer hold on?

She didn’t have the answer.

All she knew was that she felt lost in a life she had built with her own hands. And the worst part?

RPW is like dummy account sa facebook pero community siya, idk how to explain properly lol.

So last month, naa koy naka chat sa rp and same rami taga butuan. Nag chika mi, talkative kaayo siya then nangayo siyag pic nako, gihatagan sab nako. And a few mins after nag send siyag pic niya bisan wako nag ask and gi unsent dayon niya, and nag pa as if rako na wala ko ka kita sa pic kay na unsent na. Gwapo siya, 10/10 ang face card. After long conversation naa toy day nga nag kita na jud mi, we did the ✨deed✨, after ato abi kog wala na or anything wala nako nag bother ug contact pa niya. Nag chat gihapon siya and ask me if pwede ba daw mi mag FWB, ni sugot ko. After class, gina sundo ko niya and adto mig mga resto and coffee shops here in BXU. Usahay mo sneak out kog gabie and mag magic mi, after namo mag magic naa jud na always after care like kisses and lambing with food. 

So for me he is 10/10 jud. Until nawala ra siyag kalit, dili na mo chat pero at the same time wako naka block , nabastos lang ko sa part na walay explaination why na abot sa ingato kay nag S paman mi, bago palang. Daghan kaayo kog pangutana na need nako ma tubag para maka move on ko, pero karon ni gaan naman sab, naa lang part sa akoa na sayangan ko. 


kabalo ko asa siya nag work or asa ilahang balay, plate number sa iyahang car, real name niya and all, kung tuyoon pwede nako siya ma adto and ma istorya pero wala nako na buhata kay di sab sila basta basta here sa BXU and di nako gusto mag dunggag problema pa just for a D!CK.


Gusto lang nako ipagawas dinhia akong gibati na why man jud ingato ang ending? Mura ug mga bata nga di kabalo mo communicate sa feelings. 

Pero grabe no, tinoud jud diay nang ingon sa tiktok na last meet theory something. Kay bisan unsa ka gamay sa Butuan and malabyan nako iyahang work place wala man iyahang car sa gawas, or wala man lang mi nag sugat somewhere bisan sa kagamay sa Butuan. 

tbh, nag mahay ko why nakipag ✨ pako sa iyaha, Im not saying this kay wala nami contact karon. Pero we hit it raw man gud, its a difficult game biya kay delikado na ang Butuan ron grabe ka taas ang HIV cases and we hit it raw. Di biya jud ko mag raw unta pero nag pasalig man siya na di ra pang one time and kami rajud mag ✨, diko gusto mag ka sakit oy kay what if ingato na jud to siya always naay girl tapos walay protection.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. 

I assume an appropriate approach is a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined as \`gestalts´.",2,1740652603.0,nonduality,2,1.0,False

A few months ago I was taking fluoxetine, and before that I drank a lot of coffee. Coffee made me nervous at the moment, but then it went away. I loved the high it gave me. Then when I started fluoxetine, coffee made me 300 THOUSAND TIMES WORSE, I started shaking, nausea, chills, feeling faint...
Then it was time to stop fluoxetine and I haven't taken it for at least 3 months and when I drink coffee around 11 in the morning, I try to have had breakfast before so it doesn't affect me as much. But now the problem is not that it affects me so much, it's that it doesn't affect me UNTIL THE AFTERNOON/EVENING ARRIVES, I mean, coffee feels good to me all day, but then, the afternoon arrives and I feel the same effects as when drinking coffee with fluoxetine but delayed, could you say? I don't feel as if the coffee had an effect on me later, as if it was stored in some part of my body and wanted to come out to bloom in the afternoon, I feel nausea, dizziness, vertigo, a feeling of fainting...
I stopped taking it for a while and this stopped happening to me, but nevertheless I want to know what causes the effects of caffeine in my body to be delayed for SO MANY HOURS!!! 
Of course the fluoxetine did something to my body, because suddenly the coffee makes me feel so bad, I had never had these symptoms when drinking coffee AND LESS IN THE AFTERNOON, delaying

Hi!

Posting here  because I am feeling stuck in my journey, and could use some insights. 

Last time I was at my goal weight was just a few years ago (2021 or so). Unfortunately, I had some health issues that contributed to a gain of about 10 Kg, but they have been fixed as of some months ago.  

My diet is pretty decent, and I try to aim for 100-115 g of protein/day, as well as 5 servings of fruit/veggies. I usually go for a 1500-1800 Kcal allowance, depending on my activity that day. Have been advised against going lower than that, because that would be detrimental to my activity level. I use a food scale and a tracking app. No liquid calories. I drink my coffee black and drink little alcohol (no more than 4 drinks a month - that's a glass of wine or a beer). 

I'm physically active. I lift weights 3/4 times a week, surf 1/2 times a week, and I also run 2/3 times a week, with at least 1-2 rest days. I average about 20K steps/day. This activity is unrelated to fat loss efforts; I do these things because I enjoy them.

Sleep is decent (7-8 hours).

I have taken bi-weekly body measurements, and they have generally been going down since I first started taking them (1 year ago) but they aren't very accurate- my waist can vary from day to day just because of constipation or whatever, etc. 

I am somewhat muscular, but I can see I have got some fat to lose. At a minimum, I'd like to get back to a healthy BMI, and go down a clothing size (so I can wear some of my favourite pants again).

In spite of all the above, I have always been hovering at the same weight of 70 Kg for several months (lost 3Kg last year, but that was it). Blood tests are fine, nothing weird going on with my thyroid.

So, this is where I am at. 

Anyone going through something similar? How did you manage to get ""unstuck""? ",1,1740652453.0,loseit,3,0.67,False

The supplier assured me it would fit, but I ran into issues with water leaking/spraying between the portafilter and the machine.

After troubleshooting on my own, I took it to a local coffee roaster, and they pointed out that the connection points might be the problem. Interestingly, if I use the basket from the new bottomless portafilter inside my original group handle, everything works perfectly.

So, I think I need a bottomless group handle that has slightly longer locking tabs to create a better seal. Does anyone know of one that would work for a 53mm portafilter?

However, someone in the tech industry invited me to join their small SaaS startup. Their product is scheduled to launch later this year, and it’s a AI-powered lead generation tool. To be honest, I’ve never had much knowledge about this type of tool. After having a cup of coffee with the founder, I could sense their confidence in the product, but I still have doubts about whether joining such a startup team is the right choice. 

I’ve already done some research on lead generation tools and learned that there are existing options available, such as Leadfeeder, LeadsRebel, and LeadsNavi. While I can’t provide detailed insights into the product, I would say it will be somewhat similar to LeadsNavi, which tracks visitor IPs on clients’ websites and captures some details. The startup’s product may offer a slightly broader range of features at a lower annual price (but the monthly plan will be higher than the competitor). From a marketing perspective, I think it might work if they could target an actual pain point. However, since I’m not very experienced with the tech side and am new to SaaS, I’m wondering if this kind of tool is still a good direction for a startup.

Saw my gyno after a few weeks of suffering and found out I was positive for ureaplasma and that it showed up on my annual exam for the past two years. they knew and never told me; only saying I had a small overgrowth of “normal flora” but not to worry since I wasn’t having any symptoms. I was shocked at the negligence and how nonchalant she was describing ureaplasma. She only gave me a z pack but I ended up getting 2 weeks of doxy from push health after reading up on this thread and got my partner treated as well. 

I finished treatment 2 weeks ago and I’m slowly feeling better more every day. I had a herx reaction and my symptoms got worse the entire time I was on antibiotics. I ate lots of kimchi/probiotics and took biofilm disrupters and d mannose to supplement. My pain levels went from unbearable everyday to 1/10. My only symptom now is frequency but it’s reached a homeostasis that’s pretty manageable. I started pelvic floor therapy this week since I’ve been struggling with hypertonic pelvic floor long before my ureaplasma symptoms started. My new urogyno only found slight vaginal atrophy upon doing imaging which might have contributed to the frequency and pelvic pain. I’m going to take topical estrogen to help with that. I’m too scared to start drinking coffee again I had to detox because it was so irritating. At what point did any of yall survivors feel comfortable again drinking caffeine? It makes me soooo irritated but I’m suffering without it :( ",1,1740651804.0,ureaplasmasupport,0,1.0,False
