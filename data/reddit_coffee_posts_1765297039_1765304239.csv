1pietf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pietf9,Please share 🙏🏻,"Hi Everyone this is my dog Oreo, I'm in the Rochester area. I need to get my dog seen at the vet he is 10yrs old almost 11 yrs old, I had him since 6 weeks old he is my best friend and my service dog! He has bumps on his sides that have gotten bigger in the past couple months and the vet wants to run some tests to figure out what type of bumps he has growing, He also started coughing Friday night which is not good cause a cough could mean so many things, But other than the bumps and the cough he does and acts everything as normal.

don't have all the money for it right now because Im not able to work right now, But I do have a couple of ways Im trying to raise money. I make homemade dog treats, body scrubs, lip scrubs and lip glosses. I also have some things for sale like a Michael Kors Purse and a vacuum, Keurig Coffee Maker. I also set up a GoFundMe if anyone would like to donate there

Feel free to message me if you any questions or want more information.

The vet was able to give me an appointment Dec 16th so I have until then to raise the money, they said I can always come back another time if needed but my Oreo don't like the vet so I would love to try to get it all done at once it will also save me money from having to pay the fee just for him to be seen.

Here is my link: https://gofund.me/5b52b71f8
I'm half way to my goal I'm so close, even if you can just share this link please 😊

If you can donate or share the link I will be very appreciative and happy to share updates with you when he does get his tests done.

I can sign up for a few programs to help me after I get a list and prices for all the treatment he needs but I need to get him to the vet first to get the tests done to see what the next steps will have to be

I will happy keep anyone update on what's going on with him! 🙏🏻",1,1765304191.0,Rochester,0,1.0,False

UPDATE: I literally was at the venue maybe 6 hours per day, for five days total. I walked around the whole place and could NOT find Letterboxd 😭 They weren’t there at all HAHAHA

To be honest, I didn’t even think of this possibllity. I was SO sure LB would be there since they’ve been going to other Indonesian film festivals, and the LB Insta *does* follow JAFF’s Insta but alas… didn’t happen, and my mission failed.

But that’s okay. I got these nails for myself, mostly. I just thought this mission would be a fun and fulfilling extra bit but I guess it just wasn’t meant to beeeeeee 🥴

1piepfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1piepfu/where_are_their_hobbies/,Where are their hobbies?,"I (21f) can’t think of a single hobby my parents have that is either not work-related or they don’t try to brag about excessively.

My father has spent thousands on very fancy coffee equipment and he buys really good coffee beans. Yes, he makes really good coffee, but that’s not good enough for him. He and my mother have to brag that it’s “the best coffee they’ve ever had,” with only the coffee shop that roasts his beans and a few other coffee experts coming close. This isn’t some wholesome affirmation either, they mean it literally and have a superiority complex about it. When I’m home and use their coffee machine, they hover over me and give unsolicited criticism if I don’t make my coffee exactly the way they think is right. It’s ridiculous. It’s all his fragile ego has. 

My mother is orthorexic (I suspect, not diagnosed) and obsessed with her physical health. She has effectively banned many foods from her house over many years and severely judges anyone who eats, especially if it’s carbs, past a certain hour. She always goes on walks and does pilates workouts. If she can’t walk outside, she uses a stationary bike. This is great and all, but she has a worse superiority complex about it than my dad about his coffee. She brags about it every day and always includes numbers, like how many steps or how long her workout was.

If I ever go to the gym less than 3-4 times a week, or don’t walk every day that she does, she makes her judgment very clear. I think my mother has forgotten that she used to shame me for working out and even took away my dumbbells at some point because she was worried I would hurt myself or become “too big.” One time I came home from school while I was taking a weightlifting class and excitedly told her I had deadlifted a new PR, and she reacted very harshly. And she’s always criticizing my dad when he doesn’t do some ab workout or whatever else she wants in his regiment. Definition of a cardio bunny/almond mom and luckily the obsession hasn’t rubbed off on me. 

I think that doing something just for enjoyment without virtue signaling or bragging must be lost on them. ",1,1765303900.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

Bio

Meet Billy, an energetic and affectionate pup who greets everyone with tail wags, happy wiggles, and plenty of charm. He loves attention from people and happily soaks up all the pets he can get.

He’s a sweet, enthusiastic dog who’s ready to share his big heart with someone who appreciates his joyful spirit.

I need help building a daily schedule I can stick to. what’s an example of yours?,"I have issues with planning. Every day feels like a crapshoot. How do I break myself out of this mindset??? 

I keep thinking “this is the only time we can do whatever we want” in regards to schedule but the truth is that we’d all be a lot happier on a schedule.

What is your schedule like? I don’t want a crazy strict schedule, but I think I need things like “8:30am workout and check emails (ymca.) 11am is lunch at home, 12 is nap/quiet time” and “Monday is laundry day, Tuesday is floors” - no matter what.

Why do I have such a hard time with this?

I got up at 5am this morning. Had coffee on the couch. Avoided laundry sitting in a basket. We got out for a grocery store run and ended up at library storytime because it seemed more fun and now we still have to go to the grocery store.. we left storytime and baby fell asleep on the way home. Threw naptime out the window to do anything at home.

I pride myself on being pretty careful free and flexible, but it’s just not doing us any favors at this current time in my/our lives .

	The commencement speaker finishes his speech, and the master of ceremonies informs everyone they can turn their tassel to the left. I hugged my best friend, Brianna, and turned my tassel left. I look up in the stands and see my family and friends cheering and waving. My class exited to the lobby, and I spotted my family. I run into my mama’s open arms and step back to give her a good look. 
She has tears in her eyes. “Congratulations, baby girl. I can’t believe my babies are growing up.” She looks at all my siblings, and my dad comes up behind her and wraps her arms around her waist. 
He leans down and kisses her cheek. “We are a great team. I’m so very proud of you, Nadia.”
My dad unwraps his arms from my mom’s waist and gives me his special bear hug. Next in line is my brother Alex, who will graduate from Washington State next year. Alex wraps his arm around my shoulders. “I’m proud of you, sis. Sorry, the Seattle Storm deal didn’t work out.” 
Wrapping my arms around him, I say, “Thanks, it still stings, but things could be worse.”
Noelle is next, and then Seamus, Aniyah, and their children. We all walk towards the cars, and Aniyah hands Seamus Jr to my brother Alex, who walks by Seamus Sr. 
She leans into me. “I’m so proud of you, sis. I’m serious, Ms. Future pharmacist.”
With a smile, I give her a big hug. “Thank you for everything. If you ever need me to pay rent at the condo, I can.”
She shakes her head. “No. You can stay in the condo rent-free for however long you need. We want to make sure you have nothing to worry about.” We get to the car, and she looks around. “Don’t mean to worry you, but where is Nathan?”
I shrugged my shoulders. I can deal with Nathan later and determine why my boyfriend missed my graduation. 
My dad whistles, and we turn to him. “Everyone meets at Seamus and Aniyah’s for the party.”
Aniyah gives me one last hug before I get into the backseat of my parents’ SUV with my siblings. When we arrived, my sister had done a fantastic job decorating. As I looked around, I saw my friends and other family members starting to arrive. I tried to enjoy the party but kept looking at the door, waiting for Nathan to walk through. I walk over to the couch on the far side of the living room and open my unread texts. Brianna plopped beside me.
 “Hey girl, what’s up? You’ve been distant since graduation.”
 I looked over at her. “Nathan didn’t come and won’t answer my texts.” 
She hugs me. “This is your day. Don’t let him bring you down. Down, you can worry about him tomorrow.”
“Easier said than done.” Glancing back at my text messages, I see he opened and read them.
Brianna grabs my phone. “That’s enough of the asshole today. We just graduated from college, and your sister organized an amazing party.”
She holds out her hand. I grab her hand, and she leads me back to the party. The party continued, and I almost forgot Nathan didn’t attend my graduation. The front door opens, and Nathan smiles with a bouquet in hand. 
He greets my family and friends before joining me at my side. He leans down and I give him my cheek, which doesn’t go unnoticed by Aniyah.
“If you could excuse us, I think I see one of my twins up to no good. It was nice for you to show up, Nathan.” She places her arm in the crook of Seamus’s elbow and walks away. 
I smile a little at the slight shade. I turned to Nathan. “Can we talk in private?”
I don’t give him a chance to respond before I pull him outside to the balcony. “Where were you?” 
He rolls his eyes, and it pisses me off further. “Work kept me late today, babe. I’m so sorry. I was with an important client, so I didn’t have time to text you. He stepped closer and leaned in, and I placed my hand on his chest to stop him. 
	“You could have called or texted me this morning and told me you couldn’t come. I’m sure you weren’t with your client all day.” 
He sighs and runs his hands through his hair. “What more do you want me to say? I fucked up and I can’t go back to change it. Please don’t make a bigger deal out of this.”
I take a deep breath to hold back tears, and he leans in and kisses me, and I allow him. He wraps his arms around my waist, deepens the kiss, and I lean closer. He breaks the kiss, kisses my neck, and whispers, “I’m sorry, baby, I am. Let’s go back to your place and let me show you how sorry I am.” 
I fake a smile. “I think there is something you can do to make it up.”
He smiles, takes my hand, and leads me back to the party. We continue to mingle, and I pretend everything is okay, but I can’t keep going through this cycle. The party winds down, and my family, Nathan, and I stay to help Seamus and Aniyah clean up.
Aniyah and I are cleaning the kitchen when she looks over my shoulder. “So why did Nathan miss your graduation and half of your party?”
I set the rag down on the island, leaned on it, and sigh. “He said it was because of work.”
Aniyah raises an eyebrow. “Do you believe him?”
I shrugged my shoulders. “Who knows what the truth is? I don’t think I honestly care about his excuses anymore.”
Aniyah reaches out and touches my hand. “Don’t stay in a relationship longer than you should. I don’t know everything happening in your relationship, but I can tell you this: Seamus wouldn’t dare miss my graduation and show up late to my party.”
I place my hand over hers. Before being with Seamus, she was in a toxic relationship, and now she’s concerned about me. I am sure my family would understand if I talked to them about my relationship, but I feel ashamed of the situation. My dad was always an excellent role model as a husband and father when I was young. It embarrasses me to think I stayed with Nathan, the opposite of my father. Nathan comes into the kitchen and wraps his arms around my waist.
I school my expression and smile. “I think it’s time for us to leave. Thank you, Aniyah, for the party. I’ll text you later.” 
She weakly smiles at me as Nathan guides me to his car and opens the door for me. It’s a short car ride back to my condo and an even shorter elevator ride. After the elevator opens, I quickly remove my heels, and Nathan does the same. He walks to the kitchen, and I head over to the couch.
“Do you want some wine?”
“Sure, thank you.” 
He enters the living room with a glass of wine for me and a scotch for himself. His hand found its way to my thigh when I sipped my drink. “I’m so sorry for missing your graduation, but it’s not like it will be your last.”
With my lips pursed, I respond. “It may not be my last, but it was important to me, and you missed it.”
He gulps his drink and sets it on the coffee table. “I didn’t mean to miss, and I’m sorry I belittled your graduation. I know things have been difficult this year, and I’m sorry. I promise things will get easier once I get established at work.” He scoots closer, and I place my glass on the coffee table.
“You have been saying that for the last year, and it seems like everything has been getting worse. I feel you don’t value me or this relationship.”
Instead of responding, he kisses my neck and hands down my back. “I do value this relationship and you.”
I push his chest, but he doesn’t stop. “Don’t you want me to make it up to you?”
“Nathan, please stop. We need to have this conversation.”
He runs his hands up my dress and traces his knuckles through my folds. “Are you sure you want to stop this?”
He nips my throat, and I moan. We need to have this conversation, but this feels so good. Nathan stops and takes off his shirt, and I bite my lip. “I thought you would like this view.” He leans back in to kiss me, and I turn my head.
“I’m sorry, Nathan. I can’t do this anymore.”
He sits back and runs his fingers through his hair. “It’s fine. We can finish this later.”
“No, Nathan, we can’t finish this later. I can’t keep doing this with you.”
“Wait, you’re breaking up with me?”
“Yes, this year has been shit, and today was the final straw.” I look up at his face, and his face is turning red.
“I can’t believe this. You want to throw away 3 years because I missed a graduation because of work.” He gets up, puts his shirt on, and paces in front of the couch. 
“It wasn’t just because of the graduation, it’s canceling on dates, it’s going hours without texting me back. It was cheating on your coworker the year before. I honestly think you are still seeing her.” Tears form in my eyes as the words leave my mouth. He apologized for cheating and said it’s stopped, but with all that has happened, I don’t think so.
“How many times do I have to apologize for that.” He reaches down, grabs his glass, and throws it across the room, and it shatters as it hits the wall. “I’m not fucking her. I don’t want her. I’ve done everything I can to prove I’ve changed, but you won’t let it go.”
	“Get out.”
	“What?”
	“You heard me. Please get out; you are already mad and throwing shit. Nothing is going to get resolved tonight.”
	He sat down and ran his hands through his hair. “I’m sorry for throwing stuff. I’m sorry for missing your graduation. I’m sorry that I haven’t been the boyfriend you deserve.”
	He stood up, walked over to me, and pulled me into a hug. I take in his scent, and tears stream from my eyes.
	I pull back and look up at him. “I’ll leave tonight, but I want to talk about this. I don’t want us to end like this.”
	“Neither do I, but we’re going in circles.”
	“Let me help you clean up the mess at least. “
	I nod, and Nathan helps me clean up the glass, and he leaves without another word.
Me: Hey, girly pop. Want to go out tonight?
Brianna: I thought you would be with Nathan.
Me: Not tonight. We got into it. I don’t want to talk about it tonight.
Brianna: I’m coming over
Me: Thank you. 
I sit down on my couch and scroll through the many congratulations messages and the Facebook photos my family has uploaded. I hear my elvator door ping and Brianna walks in with a bottle.	




	“I picked this up. I figured you might need a pick-me-up, and Jack always helps.”
	I smile at her. “That sounds lovely. I have Coke in the fridge.”
	Brianna follows me to the kitchen and we mix drinks and turn on music.
	  “Some of our lovely classmates have sent me some places where college grads get in for free.”
	She does a shimmy and heads into my room. I laugh, “Well, let’s get going.”
	She goes into my closet, and comes out in a short purple dress with a high neck and a low scoop in the back. “This will look beautiful on you. Why haven’t you worn this before?”
	“I purchased it for a date with Nathan,” I explain with a shrug, “but he canceled at the last minute, so it’s been sitting in my closet ever since.”
	She throws the dress at me, goes back into my closet, and pulls out a dark red pantsuit. “Can I wear this?”
	I stand, take off my dress, and begin putting on the purple dress. “Sure, it probably looks better on you than it did on me.”
	She slips into the tailored pantsuit, its fabric hugging her form perfectly. I take a moment to observe her, noticing how the material accentuates her figure in a way mine never could. I’m tall with an athletic build, some curves, but Brianna is of average height, with thick thighs and a curvy silhouette that commands attention.
	I whistle. “Damn girl, you can keep that pantsuit. It looks so good on you.”
	She smiles and twirls and looks me over. “And you clean up nice, little lady. What are you doing with your hair?”
	I look in the mirror, and I currently have my curls up in a slick back ponytail. “Maybe keep it like this?”
	She looks me up and down and then checks her phone. “Let me refresh your curls, and then we are good.”
	After she fixes my curls, we head out and call a Lyft to a club. As promised, we got in for free. We entered the club filled with pulsating music and lively energy. Brianna grabbed my hand and led me to the bar, where we ordered tequila shots and took them back. 
	One of my favorite songs starts playing, and I grab Brianna as we head to the dance floor. I sway my hips to the rhythm, letting the music carry me away, when suddenly, a pair of hands settle on my hips. The person pulls me closer, and we begin grinding in sync with the beat. As I turn to catch a glimpse of my mystery dancer, his face flickers into view through the strobe lights. Hazel eyes, brown skin, a well-maintained goatee—he’s slightly taller than me, around six feet. His muscular arms and solid build immediately draw my gaze. 
I give him a small smile, and he smiles and leans close to my ear. “I have a section. Do you want to join me?” 
“I have a friend with me. Can she come?” 
He looks over my shoulder and sees Brianna, and he nods. I grab Brianna’s hand, and we follow the mystery guy up to his section, which is secluded by curtains. When we enter the section, another mystery guy is sitting on a couch. The section is lighter, and I glance at the mystery guy again - he looks even hotter in the light. Brianna and I take a seat across from the mystery guys.
 The man who invited us to the section ordered a round of shots before he spoke. “Welcome, ladies. My name is Javier, and this is my best friend, Isaiah.”
I smile. “Thank you for inviting us up. I’m Nadia, and this is my bestie, Brianna.”
The server comes back with rounds, and Brianna and I grab ours, and we cheer with the guys and take the shots. 
Isaiah speaks this time. “What brings you two here?”
Brianna leans in. “We just graduated from UW today.”
“Congratulations, ladies. I graduated 10 years ago.”
Brianna and I exchanged looks and smiles. 
Brianna’s song comes on, “This is my song. Come dance with me, Nadie?”
“My feet are hurting.” I look over and notice Javier whispering to Isaiah, and Isaiah stands.
“I can come to dance with you. If you allow me,”
Brianna giggles, “Well, come on, I don’t want to miss it.” She grabs Isaiah’s hand and leads him out of the section.
Javier gets up, and I thought he was going to the bathroom, but he sits next to me.
“Is there a reason you moved closer to me?”
“I wanted to hear you better. So, what did you graduate with?
“Chemistry and you?”
“Business administration. I don’t say this often, but you are beautiful.” 
My cheeks heat at the compliment. It’s been a long time since I flirted with anyone else. “Thank you” 
He stretches his arm along the back of the couch. The server comes back, and I hear him order a bottle, and the server leaves again. 
I bite my lower lip without meaning to, the bass from the song thumping beneath my feet. Javier’s eyes flick down for a split second—quick, respectful, but definitely noticing.
I look away, pretending to focus on my drink before setting it on the table. The music shifts into a smoother rhythm, something warm and familiar that loosens the tension in my shoulders.
Javier pats the spot beside him—closer this time.
An invitation, not a command.
I hesitate for half a heartbeat, then move over, settling next to him with just enough space between us to pretend it’s intentional.
“That dance wore you out?” he asks, a teasing smirk tugging at his mouth.
“A little,” I say, brushing a curl behind my ear. “Or maybe your friend’s tequila did.”
He laughs softly, his arm draped casually along the back of the couch, close enough that the heat from his skin gathers at the nape of my neck.
The server walks away just as the music shifts, the beat flipping into something smoother, richer—Latin, rhythmic, the kind of song that makes your body move before you even realize it.
Javier’s head lifts slightly, a smile tugging at his mouth.

“Oh, I know this one,” he says, tapping his fingers to the opening beat. “You ever danced bachata before?”
I laugh. “Uh… no. I barely survived high-school prom.”
He grins, slow and warm. “Come on. I’ll show you.”
He stands and offers his hand, palm open. It takes me a second to decide, but curiosity—and maybe the tequila—nudges me forward. I place my hand in his, and he gently guides me a few steps from the couch, still inside the privacy of the curtained-off section.
“Okay,” he says, positioning himself in front of me. “Bachata is simple. It’s all about the rhythm. Four steps.”
He taps his foot lightly.
“One… two… three…”
Then he lifts his hip slightly.
“And four.”
I try to copy him, but end up doing something closer to a confused side shuffle. I wince. “I think my feet just filed for divorce.”
He laughs, a deep, warm sound that sends a flutter through my chest.
“Relax,” he murmurs, stepping closer but still giving me space. “Don’t think. Just follow me.”
He places one hand lightly at my waist—barely there—his touch warm but respectful. With his other hand, he gently takes mine, guiding it onto his shoulder.
“Now,” he says softly, “let me lead.”

The music wraps around us, soft and rhythmic. He moves first—slow, deliberate steps—and I follow, my body aligning with his naturally. After a few tries, I start finding the rhythm, letting the beat settle into my hips and legs.
“There you go,” he murmurs. “See? You’ve got it.”
“No,” I tease, “you’re just patient.”
“Patience is a virtue,” he says, “and right now, it’s paying off.”
His thumb brushes lightly along the back of my hand. I don’t think he meant it to—it feels more like a reflex than a flirtation—but it sends a quiet warmth up my arm.
We move in slow circles, the world outside the curtains fading behind the sway of our bodies and the soft hum of the guitar. Our hips don’t touch—just the occasional brush of knees, the whisper of fabric, the shared warmth of two people learning each other’s rhythm.
For a moment, I forget everything else.
Nathan.
The argument.
The ache in my chest.
All I feel is the music… and Javier’s steady presence guiding me through it.
When the song ends, he pulls back just a little, but his hand lingers at my waist—light, unsure, as if waiting for permission to let go.
“You’re a quick learner,” he says.

“And you’re a good teacher,” I reply, breathless in a way that has nothing to do with dancing.
We both stand there for a moment too long, the silence warm and charged, before he finally lets his hand fall away gently.

It's a 14-minute documentary about a grape variety called Tarrango that most of you have never heard of. And honestly, a year ago, neither had I.  
  
But the story kept nagging at me: Australian scientists designed this grape in 1972 for Australian conditions. It worked. We loved it. Then we sent it to Britain to see if it was actually good. When the UK market moved on, we abandoned it.  
  
Now the climate crisis we were warned about has arrived, European varieties are failing in our arid areas, and this grape we designed specifically for this moment? Less than 50 hectares planted nationwide.  
  
With the help of Brown Brothers, we ended up making our own Tarrango just to understand it properly. Got to interview Dr. Peter Clingeleffer who helped create it. Blind-tasted it with sommeliers, journalists, wine professionals. The whole journey.  
  
It became a film about cultural cringe, climate change, and whether we can believe in ourselves.  
  
I'm really proud of it. And nervous about putting it out there. But here we are.

A pattern I’ve noticed: **most couples argue about the same few issues**, but because everything feels “in the moment,” we don’t realize it’s a recurring theme or a pattern. We react to symptoms, not root causes. 

You can quickly free form type into chat: small frustrations (“felt unheard in our planning convo today”) or positive moments (“he made my coffee exactly how I like it”). The app analyzes text and extract positive/negative sentiments, topics, and shows trend of each topic - bringing data to otherwise subjective ongoing discussions. The chat assistant could help rephrase things or how to approach conversation but this would need training model by family therapists something for next iteration. 

I’d love feedback from this community:

1. **Would you find something like this useful?**
2. **What else would you want it to do (or not do)?**
3. **Would you log both positive and negative moments—or only when things go wrong?**
4. **Would reviewing weekly insights with your partner feel helpful or stressful?**
5. **Anything about this idea that feels off or unnecessary?**
6. **Would you want this to be personal tracker, or add partner?**

1pieaxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1pieaxc/job_search_confidential_the_underbelly_of_the/,Job Search Confidential: The underbelly of the labor market at the dawn of AI,"I’m one of those sickos who genuinely get energy from talking to people. I was raised on “be of service first” (still unpacking that). So I talked to 81 job seekers in a week. Then 101 in 10 days. And then, as my doctor and pharmacist can attest, I had panic attacks that landed me in the emergency room. Even the Type-A overachiever, teacher's pet, honors kids are not okay anymore. And if those people are cracking, what does that say about everyone else?

I’m still doing 15-minute calls for free (up to 418 now) because the only better use of time I can think of is building small-farm housing communities so we have somewhere sane to exist when everything goes sideways.

I’m calling it:  
,  
**“The Modern Hunter: Frontlines of the Job Search in the Age of AI.”**

Because a “good job” is the modern woolly mammoth. And as Head of Partnerships at Huntr, I’ve looked at 500k applications, 250k job postings, 55k resumes, and talked to hundreds of people, while the one industry that *actually* boomed for 20+ years, tech, has a midlife crisis into a slow-motion face-plant.

It wasn’t even physically exhausting to meet with so many (shout-out to coffee and chocolate-covered raisins), it was emotionally brutal. Listening to people who did everything “right” slowly unravel because they sent 200+ applications and got silence.

You might think it’s cringeworthy that I threw myself into this like some self-appointed reporter of career misery, fine. But I’m hearing from people who were told their whole lives that if they hit the right milestones, an outcome would appear. Spoiler: it’s not appearing. This is bad.

I’ve talked to brand-new grads. I’ve talked to mid-career people. I’ve talked to retirees who planned their entire futures around a “safe job that lasts,” only to watch it evaporate. There is a real-world unraveling happening.

And the thing is that 90% of those I talk to have terrible resumes that they are spraying out and not making any changes to as they get rejection after rejection. What is it about job searching and dating apps that makes people's analytical brains turn off? So I'm doing what I can, and I'm addicted to people telling me when it's working. Someone messaged saying they got 4 interviews after meeting with me for 15 minutes (for free), after months without getting any interviews. The dopamine hit I get from that keeps me scheduling these calls and trying to convince my employer that they help us with marketing. 

The only better use of time I can imagine?  
  
Building beautiful housing on a small farm and making life resilient around basic need: Food, shelter, community. All of my money is going to go towards realizing this ultimate dream rooted in the truths I believe in. But I don't have enough cash for land and to build the agroforestry community full of bioconstructed housing of my dreams, so I keep opening the laptop.

Some days I feel manic. Like I’m seeing something obvious while everyone walks around pretending it’s fine. My friends and family are tired of hearing me rant, so here I am. Is this really it? Is this the best we've got? How do we all get out of bed and act like normal is okay? But I can't do much to change the system (yet). 

  
So what do I do?  
  
I hunt the modern woolly mammoth with people. One call at a time. Because a good resume can turn into a good interview and into a job, which can mean the world to their family.   
  
I start every call pretending it’s my first time hearing that someone who did everything “right” is now 30 days away from losing their house, despite searching every day, despite 4.0 GPAs, despite awards, internships, and glowing references.

Meanwhile, I was that over-validated kid, too. Honor roll, dean’s list, scholarships, “you’ll always land on your feet,” etc. Now I’m realizing that an entire generation was handed the same script. We thought we'd be alright if we just got the gold star.

And maybe the reason I’m still employed is that my job happens to be helping people navigate a dysfunctional system, which feels like a glitch.

That’s the rant.  
  
The only systemic solution I can offer is to build resilient communities around farms so we can either wait out the apocalypse or live in a post-AGI utopia where our lives turn toward being stewards of life and creating abundance for our children to enjoy. But this dream takes money.   


So I'll keep helping people with their job search, I'll keep ranting, and I'll keep trying my best. ",2,1765302986.0,rant,0,1.0,False
1pieae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1pieae3/agnes_tachyon/,Agnes Tachyon,"You don’t understand. No, really, you don’t. You think I like Agnes Tachyon because she’s “funny” or “quirky”? Pathetic. You think I enjoy her because she’s an eccentric scientist horse girl who talks to herself about data points and experiments? Laughable. Agnes Tachyon isn’t a character; she’s a metaphysical event. She is the unrestrained manifestation of scientific mania, the divine spark of human curiosity wearing a lab coat that’s probably been stained with twenty-seven unclassified substances. Every time she shouts “EXPERIMENT SUCCESS!” my neurons light up like a supernova on a caffeine IV drip.

She’s not just smart ;she’s insanity weaponized into progress. She’s the embodiment of the phrase “What if the collective will to progress was a scientist and also a complete lunatic?” The way she runs, no, charges across the turf like she’s chasing the Higgs boson itself; it’s not racing. It’s a collision of intellect and instinct, a thesis defended at terminal velocity. The other UmaMusume are running for glory; Tachyon is running for truth.

And the voice. My God, the voice. Every line she delivers sounds like she’s on the verge of discovering time travel through sheer force of will. It’s manic, it’s ecstatic, it’s like she’s constantly on the edge of a scientific breakthrough or a total mental collapse; and the beauty is, she doesn’t care which. Her laugh isn’t just laughter. It’s the sound of the universe briefly losing track of its constants because Tachyon decided to disprove one.

Her interactions? Don’t even get me started. Watching her torment poor Manhattan Cafe with “experimental coffee blends” that may or may not cause temporary enlightenment is like witnessing alchemy between entropy and elegance. Tachyon is chaos incarnate, and Cafe is the quiet void that somehow keeps her grounded. Together, they’re the yin and yang of existential academia; the scientist and her haunting muse. Every time Tachyon invades Cafe’s peaceful bubble with a new “hypothesis,” I can feel the cosmos tremble.

I tried to live a normal life once. I really did. But every time I hear the word “experiment,” I flinch. My YouTube recommendations are just scientific documentaries, espresso machine tutorials, and Tachyon race replays in 0.25x speed so I can analyze every micro-expression. I can’t even boil water anymore without screaming “CONTROL THE VARIABLES!” My room looks like a fusion of a mad scientist’s den and a racing memorabilia shrine — test tubes filled with coffee, sticky notes with illegible equations, and at least three framed screenshots of Tachyon grinning like she’s about to break causality.

She is ambition unchained. She is intellect without fear. She is Agnes Tachyon; the scientist who didn’t just chase knowledge, she became it. And I? I’m just her willing test subject. Inject the data. Brew the hypothesis. Collapse the waveform. If she told me to drink liquid entropy for “research purposes,” I’d already have the glass halfway to my lips.

So next time someone calls her “just another energetic Uma,” I want you to remember this: Agnes Tachyon doesn’t run races. She runs the laws of physics. Every victory is an experiment completed, every loss a necessary variable. She is chaos, caffeine, and cognition distilled into one trembling, divine form. And I am hopelessly, irrevocably, and scientifically in love with her. I am her eternal Guinea Pig.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to test a hypothesis about how many Agnes Tachyon acrylic stands a single human desk can structurally support before collapsing into a singularity. For science, and my undying love.",2,1765302955.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

I was with a friend this morning having coffee and she said that I seemed off and sad and I said it was because a post I did in a sub on reddit got a lot of upvotes but then the moderator permanently banned me for not following the rules.  
And so then I was down on myself and felt like no matter what I do it is wrong.

She said she thinks me ruminating is an ADHD thing and I should probably just be proud and ""collect"" bans. LOL.

Matthew is my son. Up north he could sleep until dawn, but here he screams each night. He screams now.

I throw off the covers and slip on sandals to walk to Matthew’s room. The hallway is lit by starlight, unfiltered through stinging cold air of the desert. What had I been dreaming about? Some maritime thing, hook and tackle and pierced lips. Blood on my hands. I lick my lips.

Matthew’s door is open, the bed empty. It is darker in his room. I see him standing at the window, drapes parted only enough for his head to sandwich between them. He screams against the window, which frosts up and clears again like a heartbeat in time with each breath.

“Matthew!” I shout. I rush over and pull his shoulder to look at me. His eyes open and I watch bloody veins retreat from his waking eyes, which close again as he faints in my arms. I start to slap his cheeks gently, ululating his name to prise him back to consciousness. I stop when I glance outside.

A shape rises from a crouched position twenty paces away, its edges so black as to appear cut out from the night. I recognize it, somehow. It disappears.

I rock Matthew, who snores. I sleep.

When I wake I am still in Matthew's room. But he is gone.

I rub my eyes to adjust them to morning. I walk out into the hallway, and stop when I round a corner to the kitchen. 

Matthew sits at the island, scooping cereal into his mouth. Metal clanks against teeth. Slurping, crunching, breathing. Behind him his mom holds a mug of coffee, its aroma acrid. Her mouth forms a smile below deep grey eyes that once were blue. They look right at me, but focus on a point beyond my head. 

""M-Matthew—""

The mouth's lips curl up. It snarls.

""Matthew, come here,"" I whisper. ""Come here right now.""

He stops eating and lets the spoon fall back into the bowl. He looks up at me. It's my son's face, his eyes. Matthew. He wouldn't have understood had I told him. It is better to come from a broken home than to live in one. I had to, for us. 

""It's alright,"" said Matthew, as if by looking at me he could dive into my mind and surface the truth. His eyes narrow at me. A bit of milk spittle seeps down his chin.

Since then I’ve always kept an extra pair of pants and shirt in my work locker. These babies have saved me a few times since. I have spilled a whole cup of coffee on myself, those came in handy. And just the other night, I squatted down and ripped my pants… again. Side note I have also seen my coworkers gotten poop and other unspeakables on their scrubs at work, which only solidified my habit of keeping an extra pair. Luckily we work in peds now so not so bad. But honestly, it’s nice having that security. I can just laugh and go change. And I don’ t have to rely on those awful paper scrubs.

I am able to pull a few good shots here n there but I just keep getting the feeling it’s off of “not good enough”. I’m finding it doesn’t taste all that different from the shops and figuring out my own preference matters more. For example I almost don’t hate sour/acidity, a tiny bit is nice and I like strong shots but if I wince or grimace after I taste it’s probably not truly good.

I’m wondering if the Opus just sucks that much. I’ve figured out the retention issues but it’s just a huge pain in the ass to dial in any beans. One medium roast is 2.7, another is 3.5. I shudder to think at what dark might be.

So now I’m just thinking maybe I get a Kingrinder K6 and just wait until I can afford a DF54. The 1Zespresso looks great but if I’m going to spend that much, then about $50 isn’t a big deal.

But then I start thinking, if I’m willing to spend $99 on a K6(after spending $80 on Opus) why not be done with it and get the DF54.

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball spectacle where the underdog is so under that they’re wearing a “I ♥ Long Shots” T-shirt to the game. The Colorado State Rams (-22.5) are favored by a margin that makes the “David vs. Goliath” story look like a *tie game*. Meanwhile, Dartmouth (+22.5) is so overlooked, they’re basically the sports equivalent of a squirrel trying to hump a fire hydrant—entertaining but not exactly a championship strategy.

**Parsing the Odds: A Math Class You Can’t Skip**  
Let’s start with the numbers. Colorado State’s home record (4-1) and offensive fireworks (84.8 PPG) make them a statistical titan. They shoot 12.4 threes per game—imagine if your morning coffee had 12 shots. Dartmouth, on the other hand, allows just 73.0 PPG, but their road record (1-2) and second-half struggles (they held Bucknell to 17 second-half points last game) suggest they’re more of a “slow start, desperate finish” team.

The implied probability of Colorado State’s -110 to -120 odds? A 99% chance to win. Dartmouth’s 21.0 odds? A 4.7% chance, which is about the same as me correctly guessing that your favorite color is… *checks notes*… “blue or green or something neutral.” The spread (-21.5 to -22.5) is so lopsided, it’s like betting on a grown man wearing a fanny pack to beat a toddler in a sprint.

**News Digest: Injuries, Comebacks, and Shoelaces**  
No major injuries reported for Colorado State, which is surprising because their star player, Josh Pascarelli, recently survived a 26-point performance without tripping over his own shoelaces. Meanwhile, Dartmouth’s Brandon Mitchell-Day is the team’s rebounding beast (8.9 RPG), which is impressive considering he’s competing against a Colorado State squad that probably eats rebounds for breakfast.

- Ambitious — chasing dreams, not situationships.  
- Can switch from deep late-night conversations to stupid memes faster than Wi-Fi drops.

- Has a kind heart and a fun soul.  
- Knows how to laugh through life’s drama instead of starring in it.  
- Values growth, connection, and partnership over power struggles.  
- Enjoys sarcasm, coffee, and travel (bonus points if you can roast both beans *and* people lovingly).

- Conversations that actually go somewhere.  
- Supportive partner energy with a sprinkle of dad jokes.

1pidwyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/1pidwyo/my_experience_spending_10_days_in_a_traditional/,My experience spending 10 days in a traditional yoga Ashram in the Czech Republic,"I’ve just completed a 9-day intensive program in an Ashram in Northern Czech Republic and thought I’d share the experience for anyone interested in traditional yoga outside of India.

**Background:** 26F. I’ve been practicing meditation on and off since I was 18. Last year, I completed a 10-day Vipassana retreat. I’m healthy, relatively strong and flexible. I've gone through CBT therapy. No major addictions, though I rarely miss my one cup of coffee a day.

I doubled down on my practice this August after learning more about Eastern concepts of the mind (shoutout to Dr. K/HealthyGamer for rejuvenating this interest). I liked the concept of going to an Ashram for personalized guidance from a guru but thought India was the only option. I eventually found an Ashram in the Czech Republic founded by a Guruji from the Nath tradition and booked the intensive program.

**The Philosophy** The program is based on the assumption that **you must master the body and nervous system to be able to master the mind and become spiritual.** You cannot bypass the physical aspect. For that purpose, we practice Asanas, Pranayama, and Meditation.

While the ultimate goal is non-duality, that is far down the road, so we focus on building the foundation.

**The Schedule** My first day was 1:1 with Guruji. For the remaining 8 days, I practiced alongside one other student.

* **07:00 – 08:00:** Meditation and mantras (started late due to winter/not wanting to shock the body).
* **08:00 – 09:00:** Asana and Pranayama.
* **09:00:** Breakfast.
* **09:30 – 12:00:** Theory (Q&A, philosophy) + some meditation/breathing techniques.
* **12:00:** Lunch.
* **12:30 – 15:00:** Break/Optional self-work.
* **15:00 – 18:00:** Asana and Pranayama.
* **18:00:** Dinner.
* **18:30+:** Self-work and rest.

**The ""Diagnosis""** On day one, Guruji ""diagnosed"" me by watching my asanas and interviewing me about my health and life. Early on, he told me I have a **fragile nervous system by birth, but a very strong and hard mind.**

He explained this is a difficult combination because my mind tries to force my body to do things it physically cannot handle. This hit hard. It was relatable, but painful to hear from a stranger. The first two days were a struggle; I really wanted to go home. Eventually, I stopped fighting it. I realized my previous practice was just ""bypassing"" uncomfortable things to chase feel-good experiences.

**Cleansing (Shatkarma)** Traditional yoga involves cleansing techniques. We did:

* *Basti* \- Enema - I did this twice during the program.
* *Dhauti:* Drinking salty water to induce diarrhea; drinking salty water and vomiting.
* *Neti* \- Washing sinuses.

The goal is to remove ""rubbish"" stuck in the intestines, stomach, and nose. I’m personally skeptical of the medical benefits, but I committed to the process. I approached it as an exercise to overcome mental blocks, especially around vomiting. I was proud of how I handled it.

**Food & Accommodation**

* **Food:** Vegan, no sugar, organic (they grow their own veg), and herbal tea only. No caffeine. My mind got very annoyed by the lack of texture and variety, even though the body had exactly what it needed. I skipped the optional coffee to break my attachment to it.
* **Ashram:** Simple, very clean, and fresh (built 2-3 years ago). I had a private room/bath, though sleeping in the hall is a cheaper option. Since it was winter, I mostly stayed inside, taking 1-hour walks in the nearby hills during breaks.

**The Tradition** The Nath tradition is neither Hinduism nor Buddhism. They don’t believe in a personalized God; when they chant to Shiva, they refer to the consciousness inside everyone. Yoga here is about re-connection with that consciousness through ""psychological death."" It is ascetic and stoic—preaching that you should give up any desire you have in this world and any wish for pleasant experiences.

**Guruji** is a Czech native who 20+ years ago travelled through India searching for a complete tradition. This way, he found Naths and developed himself in this path. He is straightforward, hardworking, and kind—he doesn’t push you past your limit, but he also won't sugarcoat what he thinks. Because he is European but directly studied the tradition and became a part of it, he has a unique ability to explain complex Eastern concepts to a Western mind. 

**Summary** This was a tough experience by design. However, it gave me techniques to work with at home for at least the next six months up to a year.

I disagreed with several of Guruji's takes about the world, but I don't think you need to agree with a teacher 100% to learn from them. While I found the tradition's asceticism (giving up all worldly possessions) too extreme for my life, I focus on the practical application. My goal is to use these techniques to master my mind and body, without losing the joy of living or my desire to make a positive impact in the world.

If you are curious about an intense yoga retreat and aren't repulsed by the cleansing techniques, I recommend checking it out. Guruji adjusts the program to the student, but beware - **this is not a spa.** Without my prior interest in these concepts and some previous self-work, this would have been much harder.

I really need to make an effort to eat before taking an hour walk or my stomach will hate me and refuse to be obedient. hahaha 

You be nice you belly you!

Well overall I need to take nutritional notes to effectively determine what caused the stomach ache. 

I can say my brain believes it was the bread and jalapenos. 

Though overall I probably wouldn't like eating it alone with sausage or cheese. The sausage grease would hurt my stomach. So maybe a better idea is simply to eat white rice, avocado, and roasted pork with some hot sweet sauce. Yum. 

:)) add some veggies too. 

I need to figure out my fiber, calcium, and protein minimums so I can adjust my food intake as well as finger out what causes my inflammation. I notice white rice only makes me slightly bloated but not really. So I think white rice is solid. The things that bother my stomach that I am aware of is

Wheat

Whole grains

Oatmeal depending on how it's made

Dairy (lactose intolerant)

**I'm surprised they said Pineapple because it actually calms my stomach. So I might just continue drinking and eating it.** 

Chocolate makes me feel fatigued 

Soda can make me feel fatigued if its dark soda. Light not so much dark yes. Root beer is kinda okay. Occasional drink. 

Onions hurts my stomach

Bell Peppers sometimes hurt my stomach. 

Maybe it was combining it with onions. 

Potato chips or potato makes me bloated 

**Yams, sweet potato are good**

**I crave so badly fruit and meat.**

**I know they said not to eat high natural fruit sugars but without those sugars I tend to loose lots of energy and even become faint so I don't think that's a good Idea.**

I love coffee and hot chocolate so maybe I can find an alternative to those two. 

I think a sweet hot tea would be solid with a side of gluten free cookies? Not sure how to find that maybe oatmeal cookies. I'll figure it out. 

I love ice cream and my daughter is allergic to nuts so i gotta figure out what to replace it with. 

Tummy still slightly hurts. 

I'll be looking for a best replacements for milk and fiber.

Not a pro trader here. I'm that guy with a weekend gig slinging coffee, who's been messing with presales on the side through the last two market swings.



What got me to ape in harder than planned? Breaking it down real quick:



1. I've stalked every Solana meme that's popped off lately (PONKE, BILLY, GIGA, MICH, WIF, POPCAT. PEPE the usual suspects). Big takeaway? The real moonshots happen post those first 2-4 solid CEX listings. $SOLF's got 4 already in the bag pre-presale end (Coinstore cranking $130-150M volume daily stands out). Team's dropping lines about 50 exchanges after launch, and it feels like straight strategy, not vaporware.



2. The presale's gaining traction as the market perks up, loving the steady vibe. When I bought yesterday, it was hovering around $155k raised; now it's pushed past $156k. That's a cool $1k+ in under 24 hours, even with the crypto world half-asleep. Feels like whales dipping in low-key, especially after that BONK whale rotated $10k worth straight over, per the fresh updates.



3. The theme's gold, unforced hilarity. ""Fart Simpson"" had me chuckling out loud, and it's catching fire organically: TikToks blowing up to 33k+ followers, X chatter where peeps are cracking up just saying it. Way better than those cookie-cutter animal memes that scream ""trying too hard.""



4. Locked $6M liquidity from day one? That's a presale beast mode move. Keeps the launch sniper-proof and dump-resistant, unlike the bloodbaths I've seen on most Raydium drops – sets the stage for those clean, viral pumps.



5. Devs are actually building, not just promising. Dropped an alpha version of ""Adventures of Fart Simpson"" in TG that's rough but ridiculously fun, and Fartchan's launching tomorrow as the go-to spot for degen vibes. Plus, that 1,000-piece free ""Fart Legends"" NFT drop with top-buyer whitelists? Turning this into a fun competition. Tired of presales ghosting on utilities; these folks are sharing previews and links nonstop.



6. Price is a steal right now. Nabbed mine at $0.000203, with the next phase hiking to $0.000250. Basically front-row seats before the crowd rushes in.



I'm just your average weekend hustler who tosses a grand or two at 5-7 presales per run, and yeah, most end up as tax write-offs. But this one's got that rare ""why didn't I max out?"" energy the setup's too spot-on for the next PONKE/WIF-level ride.



Not pushing anyone to YOLO the savings, but if you're eyeing a Solana meme coin presale where it's still dirt-early yet everything's clicking... this could be your ticket.



Let's ride to $1B cap or whatever comes, bag secured, and I'm hyped to hype it up.

1pids35,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/1pids35/can_i_ever_be_friends_with_my_therapist/,Can I ever be friends with my therapist?,"
There is a lot of discussion about transference in a romantic context and people falling for or being sexually attracted to their therapist. My situation is a little different. 

I have been with her for three years now and she has helped me with most of my issues. There are still some remaining but it's getting to the point where I am not getting as much value out of her as a psychologist anymore - certainly not to be paying her $200 per hour. I do still value her input and perspective but the relationship is becoming more familiar and less clinical. 

Very early on she established a boundary that she would never ever see me outside of the office in any context because it was unethical and she could lose her license. This came up in context of me telling her my wife was jealous of her and her saying my wife has nothing to worry about. However, that was before we spent so much time together. 

Since then we have really clicked. Our discussions come so effortlessly. We had a session for three hours once and we could have kept going. She is still pretty guarded about disclosure but over the years some things have slipped out and everything I have learned makes me like her more as a person. 

However, I am not paying her to be a surrogate friend. That's way too expensive. We talked about termination since I don't need her as much as I did before and she said she would be available to me professionally as long as I want her to be. 

What I wanted to ask her was if she would be willing to meet me occasionally (say once every other month) for coffee or something. I am afraid the answer to that would be no and with that I will lose a person in my life I really enjoy spending time with. If I was wealthy I'd pay for sessions forever but they are a big expense for me and she knows that because I have told her. 

Is there any way a therapist will remain in contact with a former patient in a social context? I said friends in the title but I don't really mean that. I don't expect us to Christmas shop together or for her to come to my birthday party or anything like that. I'd just like to keep her up to date on my life and also hear a little about hers. For example, I know she has a very sick daughter and I'd like to know how she is progressing. 

Is that totally unrealistic? If I ask her that and she slaps me down I think I will be really hurt although I know that's a likely outcome.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **BYU vs. Clemson: A Jimmy V Classic Showdown Where the Cougars Should Outshine the Tigers**

The 2025 Jimmy V Men’s Classic at Madison Square Garden—a venue so legendary it makes the phrase “March Madness” feel like a warm-up—hosts a clash between BYU and Clemson that’s equal parts basketball and theater. Let’s break down why the Cougars are the smart bet to light up the scoreboard here.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Mostly)

BYU enters as a **5.5-point favorite** (-238 moneyline), while Clemson (+195) offers a tempting underdog angle. Translating that into implied probabilities: **BYU is favored at 70.4%**, and Clemson’s 34.2% chance feels like a bargain if you think the Tigers can pull off an upset. The total is set at **150.5 points**, with slightly better odds on the under (-110 vs. -110).

BYU’s case is bolstered by their **fifth-ranked offensive efficiency** and a starting five that’s the NBA’s equivalent of a five-star Yelp review. Star freshman A.J. Dybantsa, a potential No. 1 overall pick in 2026, is a one-man wrecking crew: 19.4 PPG, 54.4% shooting, and the ability to score 25 on UConn. Clemson, meanwhile, has lost to Alabama and Georgetown by a combined 11 points—like a underdog movie that keeps getting a last-minute plot twist it can’t overcome.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Legacies, and a Side of Utah Nostalgia

BYU’s only blemish? A shortened rotation due to injuries, including sixth man Dawson Baker’s season-ending ACL tear (a tragedy for Baker, a free-agent signee for the New York Knicks, who now has time to perfect his bench-press form). But their starting five—led by Dybantsa and preseason All-Big 12 guard Richie Saunders—is as reliable as a coffee machine in the morning. Coach Kevin Young, who’s turned BYU into a national contender, calls this Madison Square Garden trip “humbling,” though it’s hard to feel humble when your team’s ranked No. 10 in the AP poll.

Clemson, under Brad Brownell, has an intriguing offensive spark thanks to transfer RJ Godfrey (12.1 PPG) and 6’11” Carter Welling (10.6 PPG). But their defense? Let’s just say they’re the reason Alabama’s fans started a GoFundMe t

two days ago i walked into my fall semester lecture… and there he was at the front. my stomach dropped so hard i almost threw up. he saw me and went ghost-white fumbled the entire intro and kept staring at me the whole time
after class he texted from a burner number: “coffee shop across campus. now.”
i went. he was a wreck. told me his hinge had old pics and he listed his job as “consultant” because professors arent supposed to hunt for students on dating apps. he’s tenured. married. has a 4-year-old daughter. the “grading” excuse? his wife thinks he’s always working late. he swears he had no idea i was his student until i walked in
he begged me to keep quiet, said if this gets out he loses everything. then told me these past 8 months were the happiest of his life… and that he’s in love with me 🥹
here’s where i became the villain:
i told him im not stopping. im obsessed. i looked a married father in the eye and said i dont care about his wife or his kid and i’ll keep my mouth shut if he keeps fucking me like he has been

Now, let me brag a little and explain why I chose to buy in at the time.

1.The charts were basically screaming at me: Buy now!

MSFT at the time showed:

https://preview.redd.it/yowweye5r76g1.jpg?width=815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=27b45e54e4bac9770821099a46c766efdb451ffd

Bollinger Band compression → Big move brewing

MACD momentum strengthening → Buying pressure arriving

RSI divergence → Price makes a new low but RSI refuses to follow

This triple-signal pattern even impressed my wife, who said,

""Hmm, it looks like it's really going to go up.""

She doesn't trade at all.

2. Microsoft isn't just a ""tech stock""; it's the foundation of AI infrastructure.

While others are still debating which AI startups will win,

Microsoft already:

has Azure (a money-making machine),

is betting on OpenAI,

has integrated AI into its entire ecosystem,

has stable cash flow, and

its CEO doesn't engage in questionable practices.

In the AI ​​gold rush, they're selling the tools.

Why wouldn't you buy?

3. Excellent risk-reward ratio.

My entry points: Clear stop-loss level; ample upside potential; near 3:1 risk-reward ratio. Even if it weren't Microsoft, I would have made this setup.

But since it's Microsoft?

I clicked ""Buy"" with the same composure as drinking my third cup of coffee

https://preview.redd.it/x8aiy2kbr76g1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1493fb96bfc09ae9ba524ad81876bffcf4b32df4

4. Institutional funds were clearly accumulating positions quietly at that time.

Trading volume, blockchain transactions, a gradual upward trend... typical signs of large investors.

No insider information needed, just the ability to read the charts.

5. Microsoft is a company that won't do anything foolish.

Some companies are like a 22-year-old romantic interest: chaotic, impulsive, and unpredictable.

Microsoft is more like a highly reliable elementary school teacher: stable, dependable, and doesn't mess around.

I like this kind of quality when dealing with large sums of money.

In short, this deal went very well...

I didn't predict the AI ​​era, but the metrics are up to par, the logic is sound, and the risk-reward ratio is excellent.

Just follow the rules.

Now is the time to casually say, ""I told you so."" Lol

1pidkax,https://www.reddit.com/r/e46/comments/1pidkax/how_annoyed_should_i_be/,How annoyed should I be.,"I recently had a power steering pump failure in my 2001 325i wagon. I had asked several vintage bmw owners for mechanic recommendations at a car's and coffee event and brought the car to a guy who's name came up more than once. He replaced several hoses including one high pressure line and the pump itself with OEM parts. The bill was almost $2k. 

Then a week later I noticed the pump was whining again and that I had a leak. I returned it, he kept the car for over a day, replaced an o ring and test drove it. I picked it up, no charge, and by the time I got home, 20 miles, the PS reservoir was empty again. 

Brought it back in, I left it with him for 2 days and demanded he make sure it was fixed. Again, an o-ring and test drive. When I picked it up this time the cabin filled with a new smoke smell once it was up to temp on my way to work. That smell has reoccured several times since. 

It's now 3 weeks later and it's sprung yet another leak, another empty reservoir and lose of power steering until it was refilled. At this point I'm worried about the health of the new pump having run dry a few times. 

Is this system more complex than I can imagine? Each time he only replaced an o ring not a failed hose, why weren't those all done the first time?!? He doesn't provide a loaners or even an uber so I'm out hundreds just on travel alone.  At this point I'm considering issuing a charge back on my credit card but would like advice before I scream at the guy. ",2,1765301397.0,e46,1,1.0,False

Dandelion: associated with liver-supporting preparations involving leaves and roots.

Chicory: roasted root documented as a coffee substitute during shortages, noted for inulin content.

Wild Rose (rosehips): referenced as a source of vitamin C in preventative and dietary contexts.

Burdock root: present in established culinary practices such as Japanese cuisine (gobo), indicating routine cooking rather than exclusive herbal use.

Cattail: young parts and roots identified as edible, with roots adaptable to flour-like preparations.

Plantain: contains protein and dietary fiber, used as a direct food component in simple preparations.

Wild Lettuce: linked to traditional analgesic applications within herbal literature.

These observations reflect practical knowledge of wild plants in earlier subsistence environments and point to resources that could be utilized when conventional foods are limited.

#Finding a Spouse in the World We Actually Live In

Some Realistic Strategies for a Culture That Thinks Marriage Is Optional

Proverbs says, *“He who finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord.”* That verse carries two assumptions: a good spouse is a rare blessing, and you actually have to **look**. Jewels don’t jump into your pocket. They’re mined. Another assumption is that if it’s good to find a wife, it's also good for a woman to be found by a godly man.

That search used to be hard enough. It’s even harder now. Most older Christians give advice drawn from a world that doesn’t exist anymore: one untouched by social media, pornography, delayed adulthood, broken homes, and the casual sexual chaos that now passes as normal. The landscape has changed. The old paths are still true, but the terrain they run through is different.

Before I deal with the terrain, I want to tell you a quick story.

#The Way It Used to Be

I met Emily in 1998 at a Bible study I was teaching. I was a senior in high school. She was a freshman. Neither of us remembers the first time we met, which tells you something about “love at first sight.” We weren’t each other’s type. But one night she cried in group because classmates were mocking her for becoming a Christian. The sincerity of her faith and her natural beauty hit me at once.

Unbeknownst to me, she’d already noticed me too.

We became fast friends and wrote each other letters, actual letters, for months. When I finally told her I was interested, I also told her something else: *“I’m going into ministry. I’ll probably be broke, gone a lot, and disliked. If you can’t imagine that life, let’s stay friends.”* I figured that would end things. It didn’t.

Our parents were involved. Our church supported marriage, children, and homemaking. There was no social media. I didn’t have internet porn in my past. We married young; she was nineteen, and the internet had played zero role in our relationship.

Almost no one gets that combination today.

And that’s my point.

#The Tsunamis

Think of culture as a coastline hit by a century of tsunamis: feminism, the sexual revolution, no-fault divorce, birth control, abortion, high-speed internet, smartphones, and social media. Each wave crashes in and then drags everything back out to sea, reshaping the landscape. The coastline after a tsunami is still the coastline, but it’s not the same place.

That’s where you’re trying to find a spouse.

If you act like nothing has changed, you’re going to get tossed around. So here are **three major challenges** you must navigate and **one mindset** that makes the whole task survivable.

_____________________________________________________

#1. The Danger of Delaying Marriage and Rushing It. 

Marriage is normal. It’s the way God designed men and women to build homes, raise children, and fill the world with image-bearers. Singleness has a purpose, but Scripture assumes most people will marry.

Yet today marriage is happening later and later. Median ages have climbed by close to a decade over the last 70 years. Fewer people marry at all. Porn use is rampant. Sexual history is a mess. Even in the church, there is drift.

Paul said, *“It is better to marry than to burn,”* and the Westminster Larger Catechism even warns against delaying marriage unnecessarily.

But here’s the balancing truth: rushing marriage is just as foolish.

People talk as if marrying at sixteen was once normal. It wasn’t. Through most of Western history, women married around nineteen to twenty-two, and men in their mid-twenties. “Very young marriage” was never the historical norm; it was the exception.

J.C. Ryle warned that thoughtless marriage is one of the most fertile causes of misery. That was true then and now.

So don’t drag your feet. But don’t sprint blindfolded either. You need maturity: emotional, spiritual, financial. Exceptions exist, but you don’t build your life on exceptions. Getting shot in the head isn’t always fatal, but you don’t make it a strategy.

#2. The Danger of No Standards—and Impossible Standards

Modern dating, especially dating apps, teaches people to filter potential spouses as if ordering a custom product:

* He must be 6’2”

* She must be under 25

* He must make six figures

* She must have red hair

* He must love the same niche hobbies

Pretty soon there’s no one left.

Pornography has only made the problem worse. It trains you to expect a bespoke fantasy instead of a real human being. The more particular you get, the smaller your pool becomes.

Have standards. But hold them with a loose hand.

Maybe the brunette twenty-seven-year-old who loves the Lord would make you an excellent wife.

Maybe the 5’10” junior salesman making $50k will grow into a strong leader and provider.

You’re not looking for a museum piece. You’re looking for someone with whom to build a life.

Ladies: consider a man if he’s godly, masculine, and respectable.

Men: consider a woman if she’s godly, feminine, and warm.

If you’re waiting for a spouse who checks every box in your fantasy list, you’re not wise; you’re delusional.

#3. The Danger of Gnostic Christianity, and Reductive Biology

The Bible holds body and spirit together. We’re not angels trapped in meat nor animals trapped in instincts. We are embodied souls.

Two modern errors wreck dating:

***Gnostic Christianity***

This treats the body as unimportant. It’s the “all that matters is the heart” crowd. They ignore physical attraction, health, femininity, and masculinity, as if these things were irrelevant or unspiritual.

***Biological Reductionism***

This treats man like a machine built for appetites. “If it feels good, it’s natural. Go with it.” That mindset built the porn industry.

Both are lies.

Character matters. But physicality matters too. Men and women are drawn to traits that align with the creation mandate: beauty, strength, competence, and fruitfulness.

It’s not shallow to desire a spouse whose body, manner, and abilities fit the work God gave husbands and wives. Calvin put it bluntly: he wanted a wife who was virtuous, obedient, thrifty, patient, and able, and yes, he cared about beauty, but within its proper place.

Spiritualize everything, and you become weird. Materialize everything, and you become a fool.

__________________________________________________________

#The Mindset You Need: A Heavenly Perspective

Marriage is a blessing, but it’s not ultimate. If you make marriage your identity, you’ll become clingy, anxious, and unattractive.

If Christ is your center, you can approach dating with joyful steadiness instead of desperation. That steadiness looks like strength. It feels like gravity. It reads as confidence.

An eternal mindset gives you the peaceful swagger you need in the search.

#Sharpening the Axe

Ecclesiastes says that if the axe is dull, you have to swing harder. Wisdom sharpens your edge. Finding a spouse takes a lot of swinging the axe: emotionally, socially, spiritually. If you do it foolishly, you’ll wear yourself out and hurt yourself in the process.

So here are a few sharpened tactics: lean, clear, and doable.

**1. Become the kind of person someone wants to find**

Attraction isn’t random. Men want feminine beauty, warmth, responsiveness, and the industriousness Scripture praises in Proverbs 31. Women want masculine strength, competence, leadership, confidence, and direction commended throughout Proverbs.

You don’t need to be perfect. But you do need to be **growing**.

Become a man with a mission. Become a woman capable of multiplying a shared mission. Strengthen your body. Strengthen your character. Strengthen your skillset. Quit assuming someone should love you “as you are” when even *you* don’t want to stay as you are.

**2. Interact with many people**

Courtship models built for intact families and early marriage don’t translate cleanly to a world of delayed adulthood, broken homes, and high mobility. You don’t need a father’s permission to grab coffee with someone while you gauge interest.

Operate in stages:

* *Interested but not exclusive* — low pressure, exploratory

* *Interested and exclusive* — intentional evaluation

* *Engaged* — mutual confidence, with community affirmation

This keeps things clear without turning every cup of coffee into a covenant.

**3. Interested is interesting**

People are drawn to those who show actual curiosity: about them, about the world, about life. Ask questions. Pay attention. Don’t stare at your phone. Don’t treat people like interview candidates. Be human.

**4. Have fun**

Joy is attractive. Seriousness without joy makes you look brittle. Lighten up. Do things that actually bring delight. A miserable person is hard to date.

**5. Catch someone on the way up**

Finished products don’t exist. The people you envy as “complete packages” got married early enough that they could grow into those roles with their spouse. Find someone with potential and character, and build a life together.

__________________________________

#Get Started

You don’t need the perfect plan. You need motion. Start anywhere. Sharpen what you can. Don’t obsess over every flaw like a producer who spends ten hours adjusting a single track. In the final mix of marriage, a lot of individual imperfections fade.

Strike out. Look for the good thing God commends. And pursue it with wisdom, steadiness, and confidence rooted in Christ, not in your own performance.

That’s how you find a spouse in an age that’s lost its mind: not by panic, not by fantasy, but by faithfulness and clarity in the middle of the rubble.",4,1765300713.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False
1pid8y9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antinatalism/comments/1pid8y9/advice_for_lonely_also_vegan_antinatalist/,Advice for lonely (also vegan) antinatalist.,"Hi guys, due to a combination of being vegan antinatalist and talking about it on social media, I'm very lonely. 
So, I've been trying to make new friends and today after a class I went to, I invited a few (non vegan parents) out for a cup of coffee. 
I got cornered by one of them who is, for want of a nicer way of saying it, a complete and utter baby freak (although, in fairness, all of them were going on a bit). 
So, she's showing me pictures of her grandchildren, now normally I nod along for a while (avoiding any praise of course) and, if when it gets to the point where they are refusing to register my non interest, I try and lighten the mood by saying something like ""I'm not maternal at all, and (laughingly) they all look like Winston Churchill to me, but I'm sure they're sweet to you"", and if that doesn't work, I start talking incessantly about my dog. 
But this woman decided to talk about absolutely nothing but babies. How she used to be a childminder and was telling me stories about that. 
At one point I just went silent, staring at the table as I'd completely run out of non committal responses to her soliloquy and she still didn't take the hint. 
I've completely given up on trying to get people to even mildly consider going vegan or holding antinatalist views. 
But I don't know what to do about friendships. It seems either a choice between socially excluding myself, or having the stress of having to pretend to be interested in something I find morally repellent.

We've removed dozens of posts these last few days/weeks about a specific question: ""How can I improve in a very short time span,"" often worded differently like, ""Bruh how can I get better, I turned 18 and my life is done,"" or some such.

Youths of Reddit, are you guys okay? Please help us understand because it is very perplexing.

Art is a lifelong passion and endeavour, its not something that you need to get ""good"" at within a 2 week time frame. Sit down, get comfortable (put some music on, your favorite show, open a window, whatever), think of every line you draw or every brush stroke you make. Enjoy it. There is no rush.

I'm assuming this has something to do with the fast-paced nature of social media likes and dopamines but please, let's discuss this in the comments while I grab a second coffee.

There is no supplement for ""getting good"" in a short amount of time. There are shortcuts, yes, and there are ways to paint or draw faster but this all takes time, effort, and skill. Even the shortcuts take time because they are developed by artists who already know how to draw, paint, render, etc.

Everyone is holding a silver plate in their hands at all times: You must remove a thing off your plate before you fill it with another, so to speak.

Anyway please stop making these posts and just relax.

I’ve been experience fatigue and it’s really ruined my gym life it’s so frustrating. Sometimes I’ve found myself going to the gym and just quitting mid session because it’s like treading through water. And there’s a clear distinction in the tiredness it’s not muscle soreness from exertion it’s just bodily fatigue making every rep exhausting. 

I have had two or so weeks off from the gym. I had the flu for a week then I just put it off for the next week. I decided today I had to go. I went to sleep at about 3.30am. I woke up at 11 ish. Made coffee, and a nice sandwich full of protein and then chilled and then went to the gym at about 3.45pm. I’ve downloaded the HEVY app trying to give myself some consistency. I start by doing 40kg squats. I found it very easy but the by set 3 it was like such a physical and mental effort to do the reps. I then went to incline chest and honestly it felt like I was pushing against someone pushing back the weights were heavy but that was not the issue. It feels like something internally. I went to do some flys and then I just had to call it a day. 

It’s so frustrating!! I am on the waiting list for a sleep apnea consultation. I had a test and I’m waiting to talk to a doctor about my results. For the last 2 months I haven’t been working and my sleep schedule is ALL over the place. Ranges from 1.30am (that is early for me. To anywhere up to 4am. Doing nothing exciting or important just on my phone. I usually get 7-8 hours sleep a night regardless of when I go to bed as I have nothing to get up for ever.

I've been in Bangalore for the better part of a decade now and life has been pretty interesting. I've met a lot of fascinating people, both online and offline. My work is pretty interesting, so thats something I'm grateful for.  I was in a pretty great relationship that lasted quite a bit.  All in all, life has been pretty great.

A few years ago, I was someone who's daily routine was just my work and my apartment where I'd just sit on computer/whatever gaming console I had at the time, watch a whole lot of content,  a few phonecalls to my school buddies once in a while, and a series of very dumb and sometimes serious conversations with myself.  I was someone who decided to just remain single for the rest of my life.  I had become so used to it, and I used to really like spending time with myself.

But life had other plans, and I met someone and things just happend, and we broke up. I was prepared to go back to being single and I assumed it would be just like riding a cycle, and I could  go back to my old ways. But over the last four years, a lot has changed, as it inevitably would.  People would move on with their lives, and phonecalls and meetups with friends are few and far inbetween.  I mean, I don't know why I'm surprised, its only natural. So life is lonliner than it used to be. But it is what it is.

But besides the loneliness, I realized how much I actually missed that connection  I had in the realtionship.  I know it's obvious to most people, but I guess I was dumb for thinking I could get over it.

So, I'm looking for someone to chat with throughout the day. We can talk about anything from the existential dread of a Monday morning to the best places to find good biryani in this city. To  talk about mindless scrolling, a sounding board for bad jokes, and maybe, just maybe, someone to meet up with for a coffee or a beer.  
If it grows into something meaningful and long term, that would be amazing.

A little about me: I'm 33, work in research and also on a startup (I know, shocking), and have a slightly unhealthy obsession with sci-fi movies and shows. I'm also a pretty decent cook and can whip up a mean biriyani/pasta.

so far i have not noticed any weakness or fatigue like my father was afraid i would and have had quite a decent amount of energy especially considering i haven't been able tobget much sleep lately due to getting up early for work and staying up late working on final projects. my first lift one day into this diet was quite normal. my second lift 5 days into this diet i felt like i had extra energy and minimal soreness after, which is surprising since i haven't been working out much recently and took a couple month hiatuses and only started back a few weeks to maybe a month ago. after eating a fruit meal sometimes it almost feels like i get a touch of euphoria and mood improvement. 

so far i have had two negative effects. the first being digestive issues. but they have already started to get better after one week but have definitely not gone away yet. the second is hungar. fruit makes you feel full quickly i assume because of the fiber, but then dosent keeo you full long, I assume because its not calorie dense like the foods were used too. i definitely have a bit of weight i can lose right now but for this to work long term i am going to have to eat more. does it get easier to eat more in one sitting over time or do we have to force feed or use more juice/smoothies.

Elaine tries to rig a ""mistletoe bump-into"" w/ a cute guy. Jerry's GF knits a horrible sweater. Kramer gets addicted to sugar & gains 50lbs","Susan is flying out to visit family in Seattle. George initially has to stay in NYC for work before Steinbrenner gives him time off for the holidays. George doesnt tell Susan & plans to spend the holiday in isolation. He can avoid his family & social obligations, won't have to buy gifts due to not seeing people, and gets to spend that money on himself and just veg out for a few weeks. ""Susan thinks I'm busy at work...my parents think im 3000 miles away. I got it made, baby!""

He first sees a boy on the street with a screeching mother, whose father is berating him for wanting a doll. He follows them & finds them eerily similar to his own childhood family.

He then gets stuck in an elevator with a couple with a beautiful woman who looks like Susan and a bald stocky glasses wearing man. He eavesdrops on their conversations and finds how similar it is to he & Susan, and how horrible the man is. They're in the midst of a divorce due to the man refusing to ever meet her halfway or spend time with her family.

He then meets an elderly bald man who is clearly single and poor/cheap, alone in a coffee shop, hitting on women significantly younger than him. The man sits across from him and rambles about his life as a former Mets employee, who always dreamed of being a city planner and laments his failures.

Elaine has a very attractive neighbor in thr building. The super hung up mistletoe randomly throughout the building. Elaine vaguely knows the guys schedule and tries to schedule meet cutes to bump into him under the mistletoe while getting laundry/checking mail/etc.

Unfortunately for her, a different guy (the mannequin guy? A rick moranis nerd type?) Has the same idea with HER as the target.

Meanwhile Jerrys GF, an aspiring fashion designer, knits him a god awful sweater. The material, color, design, fit, etc are all awful. She insists on him wearing it everywhere. He makes it a part of his bit and she dumps him then takes him back - if he keeps wearing it and agrees to pitch a line of her sweaters to Elaine since she works for the Peterman catalog.

Kramer gets a discount on a massive amount of old Halloween candy and eats nothing but it. Then with Christmas season, girl scouts are making the rounds and he buys tons of their cookies

He gains an extreme amount of weight and seems to age. His hair turns white and he stops taking care of himself and grows a thick white beard as well. he gives up on dressing up and wears a red robe and red sweatpants 24/7

Jerry and his GF guilt Elaine into mentioning the sweaters to Peterman who insists she try it out herself.

Elaine has a successful run-into with her cute neighbor...then he sees her sweater, visibly grimaces and makes an excuse to leave

Kramer runs out of cash and tries to get the scouts to give him cookies for free. They refuse even though they suspect he is Santa Claus. George runs into (and doesnt recognize) Kramer on the street as an angry Kramer desperate for a fix is demanding candy and treats from people eating on the streetn and pointing at everyone and calling them ""naughty"" and ""putting them on his list"" when they refuse.

George has what he thinks is a wild eyed crazy Santa look him in the eye and say ""NAUGHTY BOY"".George flees, Three Musketeers in hand

Upon getting home he flashes back to all the people he met plus Kramer. The phone rings and its Susan, asking how work is and if he thinks he'll make it.

George pauses, checks the TV guide, sees Spartacus, and says ""Not this year, babe""",5,1765300211.0,RedditWritesSeinfeld,1,1.0,False

We do not live near his parents or two of his siblings, including his sister - they're in another state. We have been NC with his parents for the last 5+ years and low contact with his out-of-state brother. I have maintained a decent relationship with his sister throughout that whole ordeal and keep in touch with her but have not seen her in person since before the plague times due to the plague, distance, family chaos, etc.

I have switched jobs recently (I'm a nurse who works in research) and will be doing some intermittent work travel to where they live and would love to have coffee/lunch with my SIL and her hubby/kiddo while I'm in town. I miss her - we missed her wedding because of the plague and she's got a toddler I haven't met yet but want to because he's so stinking cute. I'll only ever be in town for 18 hours tops, but I don't want anyone else in his family to know that I'm in town. I have zero desire to see them/engage with them because they'll re-hash all the reasons we went NC/LC with them and I'm not interested in doing that, especially while traveling for work. I don't want to put my SIL in the middle of anything but I'm not sure if I would be the asshole if I asked her not to tell her parents/brother that I'm in town if I call her and let her know I'm coming and want to see her.

My husband's family is complicated. There's a lot of stuff they all definitely need to unpack in some serious prolonged therapy and I don't know how my husband turned out reasonably normal. Telling one of his family not to tell anyone else something is almost guaranteed to have the rest of them knowing anyways within a day along with some bonus thoughts and feelings about you wanting to keep a secret from the family. 

There have been a lot of changes in the family in the last few years that were kicked off by my husband and I going NC with his parents. The brother and sister that live by his parents initially did not take it well or understand. His brother who lives by us totally gets it, so that's nice. We subsequently went LC with the out-of-state brother and my SIL started to understand what happened as her relationship with my MIL/FIL started to evolve/change as she moved out/got married. I know that my SIL has her own issues with my MIL/FIL but I'm not entirely sure what the state of the out-of-state family is and at this point, I'm too afraid to ask, partly because it would restart the age-old conversation of ""why don't my children talk to me"" courtesy of my MIL.

I am acutely aware that asking my SIL to hide that I'm in town from my BIl and MIL/FIL is simultaneously reasonable (because it's none of their business) and unfair (because it's not her responsibility to deal with me being NC with them). I don't want her to feel like she has to hide anything. I'm not asking her to never tell them that I was in town, it's not like I'm her dirty little secret. I just don't want them to know until I am already gone. I don't need my MIL showing up unprompted to coffee/lunch to try and fix things with me (which she would do).



So WIBTA if I asked my SIL not to tell her family that I'm in town when I'm there for work and want to see her?",2,1765300191.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,1,1.0,False

In the beginning of last year we and our friends group decided to go to Disneyland to celebrate our graduation if we graduated. We did go but Rose didn’t want to go I was ok with that because I thought that she felt bad and was sad because she didn’t graduate but after that she started to ignore us ( me and the all groupe) . Since July I have only seen her 2 times , one in the mall and the other time I went just next to her house to get to see her. When I suggests to go out she always say yes and then I will messages her about it and suddenly she can’t and have something to do. It happened 6 times and honestly I’m tired of that and I know she lie because last week we were supposed to go to a coffee shop and surprise surprise she had a wedding to attend and she forgotten🤡 but she forgotten that she had her Snapchat localization on and to my surprise ( I’m not surprised) she was home all day , didn’t know her home was a wedding venue .

Please read my story with hypertension.,"I have had a juvenile onset of hypertension and that was due to extreme stress, very strict Indian parents who used to beat me, obesity and junk food on the regular + soft drinks everyday + depression and self harm. Docs measured it at the clinic when i was 17 at 150/100 on a regular but i wasnt concerned at all. 2 years later in college i decided to add meds as i was smoking and drinking a lot and my bp was well controlled on a combination of telmisartan 40 and amolodipine 5.

I got the urge of getting healthy back in the pandemic and decided to quit all my bad habits and lost around 40 kgs and decided to go to the doc who measured my bp to be 100/60 and he said it was too low and decided to remove my bp meds. I thought I had ""cured"" high bp but soon i started getting headaches and the doc then added telmisartan 40 to lower a bp of 140/90 which was taken in office. I continued drinking once a week, albeit it was heavy binges but my marker remained fine. In office readings ranged from anywhere between 120-130/80 and doc said it was great. Once I got hammered in amsterdam and had a splitting headache and thought it was due to severely high bp but i went to the hospital and they checked my bp and it was 127/76! After a night of very heavy drinking and smoking and coffee + idk how many vodka red bulls lol. Perfect! However I used to lift everyday.

I came back to my home town and I drank with my gf and then the next day had the same headache again and went to the hospital. BP was 140/90 and i guess it was fine after binge drinking 8 beers + smoking however here is the bad part. I suddenly felt a weird skip of the heartbeat and developed tachycardia and had my first panic attack with a bp of 200/100!. The nurse rushed to get the ECG machine and ECG was fine. Doc referred me to the cardiologist and i became paranoid thinking that this could strike anywhere. At the cardiologist i became seriously worried and my bp started reaching new highs and was measured at 145/92 and she added an evening telmisartan 20 mg dose however i developed a severe panic disorder and decided to start measuring bp at home. I used to freak out over 130s as well which i considered to be normal before. Then after 130 it used to be 140 then 150 then 180 and then i used to rush to the hospital. The doc also added amlodipine but it started giving me a RHR of 90!!

I decided to keep measuring my bp all day and kept having daily panic attacks. I started testing everyday and got 5 echos, TMT, ct calcium scan, 300 ECGs, countless blood tests, MRIs, CTs, etc

However soon it started dawning on me that it might be a panic disorder so i went to the psychiatrist who started me on paroxetine. I soon started getting better and went to work for a month. During this time i quit my job. I stopped thinking about my BP but developed a severe case of costochondritis which kept making my chest feel terrible. I came back from work and started measuring my bp 200 times a day. Before a 130/80 at the hospital used to make me feel fine for 6 months but now i realised that i needed to get on top of this.

It has been 2 years i have been trapped in this. Sometimes my bp is high. Today I checked in the morning and it was fine at 116/77 but then continued rising after my telmisartan dose and reached 135/80 and in the evening i continued measuring and it was 170/109 on the Omron machine. I immediately rushed to the doc and he measured it manually and it was 155/70 in the mercury machine; a far cry from the 109 diastolic. I came home and measured it and it was 130/80 and then 123/73 and then after walking it was 118/76 on the left and 127/76 on the right arm. However in the evening it becomes high. It also seems high until i check. Once I check it starts going down.

Day before at the doc the first reading was 164/80 and then second was 142/80 all within a minute and he said that diastolic matters more. My cardiologist doesnt check my bp in her office and said home readings are more valuable.

Im very scared. Idk if this is anxiety or actual hypertension.

Sometimes when i feel very cold I start getting very cold clammy hands and then my bp becomes high and my body contracts.

My RHR is 45 hence I cant add any beta blockers. I am pretty active and exercise a lot everyday. Lifting + 12-15k steps.

However my bp is so labile that i can get a reading of 150 and 130 within 10 seconds of each other. The cardiologist said its not possible but i have seen this with the mercury machine that i have at home too!!!!

Yesterday I measured my BP 200 times-

I follow the instructions and use one spoon provided, then I have exactly the same reaction as on the video. The coffee machine makes a sound as if it is working and nothing comes out.

I have cleaned the machine too and am completely lost why nothing is coming out and the coffee just goes into the dispose tray. 

No issues using the coffee beans.

1picw17,https://i.redd.it/b43toeoim76g1.jpeg,"Why Young People Are the Loneliest Generation, And What We Can Do About It","If you’ve ever felt lonely, even while surrounded by people online, you’re part of a growing reality that a lot of young adults don’t talk about openly.

New data shows something surprising: loneliness isn’t just an “older people” problem anymore.

In fact, **18-35-year-olds are now reporting some of the highest levels of loneliness** across all age groups.

This isn’t a small shift. It’s a warning that our generation is disconnected in ways we don’t always notice… until we do.

Let’s break down what’s really going on, and more importantly, what we can actually do about it.



# The Shock: Younger People Are the Loneliest Generation

Recent findings reveal a major change: While older adults still experience loneliness, **nearly 70% of young people report feeling lonely** regularly.

Compare that to just a few years ago, when loneliness numbers were much lower, and especially lower among young adults. So what changed?

# 1. We’re “connected,” but not connected

Our generation is always online. We text. We scroll. We comment. We react.

But digital interaction isn’t the same as emotional connection. You can have hundreds of contacts and still feel like no one really knows you.

# 2. Life looks different now

More young adults are:

* Living alone
* Moving for work
* Drifting from childhood friendships
* Delaying long-term relationships

Nothing is wrong with these choices, but they come with emotional gaps that aren’t often discussed.

# 3. Our social environments are fragmented

Most cities, workplaces, and communities are age-segregated. Younger generations rarely interact deeply with older ones, and that removes a layer of support that humans used to rely on.

# 4. The pressure to “look fine” is exhausting

Social media tells us to be busy, successful, booked, thriving, and unbothered. But behind the curated aesthetic, many people feel alone… and feel like they’re the only one who feels that way.



# So What IS Loneliness, Really?

Here’s the twist: You can be physically alone and feel peaceful, or surrounded by friends and still feel lonely.

Loneliness isn’t about the number of people around you. It’s about **whether you feel understood, supported, and genuinely connected**.

It’s about:

* Having someone you can open up to
* Feeling safe to be yourself
* Knowing someone actually sees you

That inward feeling of disconnection is what more young adults are reporting than ever before.  


# Why This Matters (More Than You Think)

Loneliness is emotional, but it has real-world effects.

Long-term loneliness is linked to:

* Higher stress
* Anxiety and depression
* Trouble focusing
* Poor sleep
* Physical health risks

For many young adults, these symptoms show up quietly. You don’t always realize the root problem is loneliness, because you feel “busy,” “tired,” or “burnt out.”

But the real issue might be deeper: **you’re missing a meaningful connection.**



# What Young People Actually Need: Real, Human Connection

Not more followers. Not more likes. Not more group chats that no one responds to.

What we need is **real friends**, people who make us feel understood.

This is where solutions need to evolve. Because right now, most social platforms don’t help with loneliness… they make it worse.

Currently, most social platforms exacerbate loneliness rather than alleviate it



# What You Can Do Right Now: Small Moves, Big Impact

Here are simple steps that actually help with loneliness (and no, none of them are “get more followers”):

# 1. Reach out to one person today

A quick message. A “thinking of you.”A “want to catch up this week?”

One real check-in can reopen a connection you didn’t realize you needed.

# 2. Prioritize depth, not quantity

You don’t need 20 friends. You might only need one or two people who *get* you.

# 3. Don’t wait for big plans

Coffee.A walk. A 10-minute call. Small hangs build real bonds.

# 4. Try meeting people around shared interests

It lowers the pressure instantly, and it’s one of the easiest paths to genuine friendships.

# 5. If you’re struggling, say it

No dramatic speech needed.Just something like: *“Honestly, I’ve been feeling a little disconnected lately.”*

You’ll be surprised how many people quietly feel the same.



# A Final Reminder: You're Not Broken, The System Is

Young people are the Loneliest Generation. If you’re in your 20s or 30s and feel lonely, it doesn’t mean you're behind, or failing, or missing something everyone else seems to have figured out.

Society changed. Technology changed . Our lives shifted. **But our emotional wiring didn’t.**

Humans still need warmth, consistency, and belonging.

And we can build that, together.",1,1765299916.0,Socialode,0,1.0,False

Money isn’t everything but without my job we would not be able to afford our mortgage, daycare, etc. so it is vital that I am showing up and making a good impression at this job that I started a freaking week ago. 

My spouse is in education, but are admin, so they technically have off on snow days but may have a few emails to answer here and there. 

We are on our third day of daycare being closed for snow in the last week. I wake up at 6-7 am, shower, let out the dogs, start coffee, answer a few slacks / emails, get the baby up and dressed, and do activities with him for an hour or so- color, songs, books, blocks etc. put dinner in the crock pot. My lovely husband lays in bed “answering emails” until at least 9 am, then claims he is up and I just need to let him know what I need for help… ok cool.

When I finally voice that I need his support with the baby,  the TV turns on, it’s a snow day fine.
I bring out my AirPods and watch the movie with the family while I am chugging through training HR videos. I go to take a bathroom break and when I come out 5 min later my toddler is chewing on a crayon and my husband is letting him?! Says it’s not a big deal, compares it to how I let him explore climbing at times and he wants us to be more cautious?! 

I just sometimes hate that I signed up for a situation with a low earner who doesn’t always pull his weight and has a shit attitude, makes me not a kind person and tired, so tired.

1pict48,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1pict48/please_someone_help_me/,Please someone help me.,"I have had a juvenile onset of hypertension and that was due to extreme stress, very strict Indian parents who used to beat me, obesity and junk food on the regular + soft drinks everyday + depression and self harm. Docs measured it at the clinic when i was 17 at 150/100 on a regular but i wasnt concerned at all. 2 years later in college i decided to add meds as i was smoking and drinking a lot and my bp was well controlled on a combination of telmisartan 40 and amolodipine 5.

I got the urge of getting healthy back in the pandemic and decided to quit all my bad habits and lost around 40 kgs and decided to go to the doc who measured my bp to be 100/60 and he said it was too low and decided to remove my bp meds. I thought I had ""cured"" high bp but soon i started getting headaches and the doc then added telmisartan 40 to lower a bp of 140/90 which was taken in office. I continued drinking once a week, albeit it was heavy binges but my marker remained fine. In office readings ranged from anywhere between 120-130/70-80 and doc said it was great. Once I got hammered in amsterdam and had a splitting headache and thought it was due to severely high bp but i went to the hospital and they checked my bp and it was 127/76! After a night of very heavy drinking and smoking and coffee + idk how many vodka red bulls lol. Perfect! However I used to lift everyday.

I came back to my home town and I drank with my gf and then the next day had the same headache again and went to the hospital. BP was 140/90 and i guess it was fine after binge drinking 8 beers + smoking however here is the bad part. I suddenly felt a weird skip of the heartbeat and developed tachycardia and had my first panic attack with a bp of 200/100!. The nurse rushed to get the ECG machine and ECG was fine. Doc referred me to the cardiologist and i became paranoid thinking that this could strike anywhere. At the cardiologist i became seriously worried and my bp started reaching new highs and was measured at 145/92 and she added an evening telmisartan 20 mg dose however i developed a severe panic disorder and decided to start measuring bp at home. I used to freak out over 130s as well which i considered to be normal before. Then after 130 it used to be 140 then 150 then 180 and then i used to rush to the hospital. The doc also added amlodipine but it started giving me a RHR of 90!!

I decided to keep measuring my bp all day and kept having daily panic attacks. I started testing everyday and got 5 echos, TMT, ct calcium scan, 300 ECGs, countless blood tests, MRIs, CTs, etc

However soon it started dawning on me that it might be a panic disorder so i went to the psychiatrist who started me on paroxetine. I soon started getting better and went to work for a month. During this time i quit my job. I stopped thinking about my BP but developed a severe case of costochondritis which kept making my chest feel terrible. I came back from work and started measuring my bp 200 times a day. Before a 130/80 at the hospital used to make me feel fine for 6 months but now i realised that i needed to get on top of this.

It has been 2 years i have been trapped in this. Sometimes my bp is high. Today I checked in the morning and it was fine at 116/77 but then continued rising after my telmisartan dose and reached 135/80 and in the evening i continued measuring and it was 170/109 on the Omron machine. I immediately rushed to the doc and he measured it manually and it was 155/70 in the mercury machine; a far cry from the 109 diastolic. I came home and measured it and it was 130/80 and then 123/73 and then after walking it was 118/76 on the left and 127/76 on the right arm. However in the evening it becomes high. It also seems high until i check. Once I check it starts going down.

Day before at the doc the first reading was 164/80 and then second was 142/80 all within a minute and he said that diastolic matters more. My cardiologist doesnt check my bp in her office and said home readings are more valuable.

Im very scared. Idk if this is anxiety or actual hypertension.

Sometimes when i feel very cold I start getting very cold clammy hands and then my bp becomes high and my body contracts.

My RHR is 45 hence I cant add any beta blockers. I am pretty active and exercise a lot everyday. Lifting + 12-15k steps.

However my bp is so labile that i can get a reading of 150 and 130 within 10 seconds of each other. The cardiologist said its not possible but i have seen this with the mercury machine that i have at home too!!!!

If you’re running the classic discovery - > demo flow (n mainly for mid-market), this is stupid simple but stupid effective.

Add a small tiny call with your champion between discovery and the demo - they call it bridge call. Takes zero effort but your demo conversion rate will look rigged.

I usually just ping my champion a couple days before the demo:

‘Hey, got 10 mins? Wanna run you through my demo plan real quick, just making sure it matches what you had in mind’

If they ghost you, that deal was already on life support, good to know early. But if they’re a real champion, they usually say yes immediately.

And that’s where the fun starts, outside the committee room people finally talk like humans. I’ve had champions literally hand me the cheat codes like what to show, how to pitch their own team,who’s gonna block, what objections are coming, which competitors are lurking etc.

Do this right and it’s borderline unfair how much advantage you get.

1picpqu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1picpqu,[Routine Help] - *pls help* Skin Never Recovered After Medical Grade Routine,"**SKIN DOWNLOAD:**  
My acne showed up in my 20s, and I’ve basically been on Spiro since 2012. It helps a ton, but I still deal with redness, inflamed breakouts, closed comedones, texture, the whole mix. A few notes below on my general skincare approach! 

* I really try not to fall for trendy skincare or cult products, I’m extremely skeptical by default, I don't have Rouge status at Sephora! 
* I have a dermatologist and I do like working with one, but I get frustrated with the “redness? okay here’s another pill… have you tried Accutane??” approach
* I do believe acne is often a sign of something internal, I eat pretty healthy, I’m dairy-free, and I’m planning to work with a naturopath next year to do full hormone + gut testing. (I also get chronic yeast infections, which feels related.) I do what I can for gut health, bone broth before coffee, Coconut Cult, etc.

**THE SKIN ROUTINE THAT MADE MY ACNE WORSE : (((**  
I moved somewhere warmer \~3 years ago and my skin went from “not great” to “ah shit.” Makes sense, more heat/sweat = more breakouts, so I decided to see an esthetician. Before I moved, I had a Glowbar membership and my skin looked the best it ever has, so I figured why not.

This esthetician had me on medical-grade everything and it unfortunately wrecked my skin. I was double cleansing with a glycolic acid cleanser 2x/day. I thought I was “purging” and it would get better, I'm afraid it never did. Three months in, no improvement, so I quit.

And honestly, my skin has never bounced back...

**WHERE I'M CURRENTLY AT:**  
I stopped working with an esthetician and only stuck with my derm. For the last two years I have focused on a gentle cleanser (Vanicream) and using tret + Azelaic acid 15%. About a year ago we switched to adapalene because I just could not get past the tret purge. And that’s exactly how I feel overall: like I never get to the “glowy retinoid skin” stage, just stuck in irritation mode.

It’s been three years and I still don’t totally understand what’s going on...

I lurk this subreddit constantly and wonder if I’m dealing with a damaged skin barrier, but in addition to redness and closed comedones, I also have blackheads in the cheek area and deal with skin texture, so I am in this loop of: am I cleansing too much? or too little??

To make it extra fun, I got micro needling done in June and have had closed comedones in those areas ever since, pretty sure that was another mistake...

At this point, I'm super paranoid: I won’t buy anything OTC unless it passes an acne-check. My barrier feels compromised, but I won’t buy heavy “barrier repair” creams as they typically have oils that don’t pass the acne-check, and anything that isn’t “non-comedogenic” freaks me out. A few reccos from this sub + my thoughts:

* LRP Cicaplast Blam B5+ for skin barrier repair, scared to use this due to these ingredients: Shea Butter
* I have seen that some folks can’t tolerate Vanicream, because of the “fatty alcohols"" (cetearyl alcohol) (\*cries\*), now what do I do? I thought this was the most tolerated / gentle stuff on the market!! 
* I have removed a morning cleanse as a lot of folks recommend this, but I do work out in the AM so I will use micellar water for cleansing in the AM
* I'm interested to try J or K beauty as I have heard they are more gentle, any reccos that pass the acne-checker? [https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/](https://acneclinicnyc.com/pore-clogging-ingredients/)

**CURRENT ROUTINE (still on Spiro 50mg/daily):**  
**AM**

* Warm water in the shower (micellar water if I work out in AM)
* Vanicream moisturizer
* Azelaic Acid 15% (\~3x week)
* EltaMD sunscreen

**PM**

* Micellar water
* Vanicream gentle cleanser
* Vanicream moisturizer
* Adapalene (3x/week)

I'm so discouraged at this point and feeling so stuck, would love to hear your feedback/reccos, thanks a TON! ",1,1765299545.0,SkincareAddiction,3,1.0,False
1picpix,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1picpix/th_she_called_herself_precia_when_she_worked/,[TH] She Called Herself Precia When She Worked,"She called herself Precia when she worked. 

A name that derives from Praecia, a high-class Roman courtesan. Soft enough to sound exotic, memorable enough to stay on a man’s tongue.

However, three years ago or another life, perhaps she would be a nurse, teacher, or a man’s wife. But nobody controls their destiny as much as we would like to believe. Things change; so do lives change. Sometimes for the better. Often for the worse.

This is Precia’s reality; in a Marriott hotel, room 46. Layering a sparkly red lipstick, she stands in a black silk gown that hugs her curves, the high slit revealing just enough. Enough to make a man pause. Her beauty; sharp as a knife, with high cheekbones, a small nose with big, luscious lips, and eyes the colour of dark honey. She wears Chanel No. 5, something warm but smoky. And Precia’s final touch, not to reveal the entire face as waves fall over the side.

She looks at herself one last time adjusting anything that needs to be perfected.

What makes Precia, Precia?

Only one thing:

Men think they choose her.

They never do.

She notices the twitch in their jaw, their eyes sidling in their confidence, and the hunger behind their politeness. She reads a man. She understands them. And that’s what makes her dangerous.

Precia know how to play the game: a smile across the table, perhaps a glance to keep them tamed, a couple of sensual words dropped in a glass of wine. Always and always in small dose of ecstasy that keeps men’s obedient.

She has a story, however, like many other women. And like many other women, she never reveals it.

What shaped her into this?

Betrayal, most likely.

The first man who lied taught her everything about love. That neither compassion, nor trust, nor love protects the sanctity of a young girl. Because in losing control once, she learned the truth that shaped her. Whoever holds the power decides who bleeds. She vowed never to be powerless again. From then on, she remains in the shadows, with mascara and red lipstick on as her armor.

She knows the world now too well because she was thrown into it.

Thrown into mad man’s world in which sex is the doorway.

But for Precia, the confession is the truth.

Her strength lies in understanding men so profoundly that she sees them from a perspective no polite society would ever dare articulate. Some confessions must be spoken over wine, over cigars, in the dim light of a hotel room far from the world, but always close enough to feel its weight. 

—
Three knocks on the door.

It was her regular client, a middle-aged Arab man steps inside, smell of oud and coffee followed. Two inches taller than Precia, with wavy salt-gray hair, even salty, thicker eyebrows, a neat beard, and dark brown eyes that softened when he smiled. He hugs her, and Precia hooks a finger around his tie, guiding him toward the bed before pushing him gently onto it. She pours two drinks, hands one, and settled on his lap.

They laugh, talk, kiss.

Slowly, the room shifted toward intimacy.

The Arab goes harder and harder, one position after another, different screams with different moans where blurred into a playful night until it ended with the Arab loud growl filled the room. Reality is, the detail of the act never matter, neither to her nor to him. For him, it was a momentary forgetting. For her, it was the doorway to his truth.

So, Precia cuddles the Arab man as he lights a cigarette. His hands trembles. She know why: his thoughts always returns to his wife and son. “You’re better than a doctor,” he remarked. “You understand need and pain.”

She didn’t flinch at his brokenness. He speaks freely with some guilt about his wife, who no longer looked at him, about his son, who couldn’t be reached, about the emptiness that followed from the office to bed. His phone buzzed with emails after emails. He ignores them.

Untouched. Unspoken. Unseen.

“It’s truly a curse to be an old man, believe me,” he laughs, his eyes and thoughts are somewhere else.

“I am here for you. Anytime.” Precia replies.

Precia listens without judgment. Sometimes that’s all a man needs. They are about feelings too fragile to reveal to a wife, too heavy to reveal to a friend, too shameful to reveal to a son or daughter. They fear being seen as weak. So, they seek a stranger with whom they can share how they feel, and the feeling of having to stay invisible.

Someone who will not remember their tears.

In those dimly lit rooms, after one man confession and then another. Precia realized the stark reality that very few others do:

Vulnerability is what men fear most, yet crave the deepest.

So the red clock ticks – ticks – ticks – senselessly without a thought, and without a pause until the Arab left.

When the door closes, Precia’s reflection caught in the mirror, half comforter, half confessor; as heaven and hell had collapsed onto her head, then to her heart. Her eyes drifted far beyond her own reflection; witnessed more truth behind those closed doors than most people ever would in the light. As the makeup comes off, slowly by slowly, layer by layer, she sees a woman who is neither a hero nor a villain, but a something far more dangerous. A woman who understands men deeply, perhaps too deeply at times.

Because men confess to her, everything to her.

Their infidelities,

their ambitions,

their fears,

their memories.

Under the illusion of her affection, they return again and again for the same ecstasy, the same false love, the same version of her that never existed to begin with. Once, a client whispered, “I know you don’t love me.” She remembers how he added, with the desperate conviction of a madman, of dog clutching a bone, “but I love you enough for both of us.”

So, what makes Precia, Precia?

Precia stands naked, staring at herself with emptiness,

the way one stares at an empty vase.

She is a myth curated by men who believe in her.

The woman who sees them, desires them, fixes them.

Men return, one by one, ready to spill their secrets, their memories, their stories; addicted to the illusion of ecstasy created by Precia.

But Precia desires only one thing:

Control.

And she is very good at getting it.

Because some men created monsters,

and never realize it until too late.",1,1765299533.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

I was hoping to get some input on installing a pair of la marzocco swift ceramic burrs (made by ditting) in a DF64. This is my first burr swap and I am curious if these burrs are compatible. 

  
The concern comes from my understanding that Ditting burrs generally spin counter clockwise besides a select few burrs, such as the lab sweet, which I've seen been succesfully installed into DF64s. Based off the directionality shown in this burr, it seems like the DF64 motor would need to be reversed for it to be compatible.

This leads me to 3 questions: 

1). has anyone succesfully installed ditting burrs that spin CCW in a unmodified DF64 before? I have not seen any examples in my research online. 

2). Is there a relatively safe procedure to convert a DF64's motor polarity? 

3). Are there any suitable Burr alternatives for traditional italian style syrupy espressos besides the SSP HUs?  I primarily make milk drinks and use medium roast coffees, sometimes a light coffee.

coffee 💛🐾

📍Location: Paws & Pause, Sector 70, Noida

Hi everyone,
I'm sharing this with a lot of hope.

Coffee was once an old, malnourished street indie dog who could barely walk. When I found him, he was tired, in pain, and completely alone. Taking responsibility for him wasn't easy; I'm a student and I also look after local strays, but leaving him on the street in that condition didn't feel right. 💔
Somewhere, I've made peace with the fact that his rescue was meant to be a part of my journey and destiny.

He's battling osteoarthritis, pressure sores, and multiple lumps across his body. He's on medication to slow the growth of cancerous lump cells and needs regular vet attention.

So, at Paws & Pause, he receives 2x physio, 2x infrared therapy, 2x eye cleaning, 3 meals, medicines, grooming, emergency vet visits, and full support every day. I'll keep sharing updates for transparency

I visit him every weekend, and I keep all updates, bills, and videos in a Drive folder for complete transparency.

Monthly expenses for Coffee:
• Boarding & daily care (Paws & Pause):₹5,000
• Medicines: ~₹2,500
• Vet + ambulance (as needed): ~₹2,000
• Total monthly need: ₹7,500-10,000

Thank you for taking the time to read Coffee's story. He can't speak for himself, but he feels every bit of kindness. Your support gives him dignity, comfort, and the warmth he never received in his younger years.

📅 Date of current emergency: 15 December
2025
💸 Amount needed now: ₹8,000
🧾 All receipts & updates:

I have attached a QR in the post and drive link, to support coffee. I don't need a single donation. All contributions go directly to Coffee's care and love. All bills will be shared with every donor. Please add ""For Coffee"" in the transaction note.

If you'd like to support Coffee monthly, you can do so through BuyMeACoffee; I would be forever grateful.🙏

I don't know exactly how to explain this other than saying that I feel completely devoid of emotion other than irritability.  I can't seem to cry for some reason.

For example, next time you have a coffee or tea, take a **sip-by-sip pause.**

The Unavoidable Hallmark Movie Trope Checklist:

* **The Big-City Executive/Overworked Businesswoman:** She's got a $300,000 job, a penthouse apartment, and an engagement ring from a bland finance guy named **Chad**. But wait! She's forgotten the **TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS/LOVE/LIFE** and needs to be rescued by small-town charm. Her job often requires her to travel to a place without good cell service.
* **The Impossibly Charming Small-Town Single Parent/Baker/Carpenter:** He's ridiculously good-looking, an expert at making hot cocoa, and his job is something wonderfully artisanal, like crafting miniature wooden carousel horses. His dialogue is 80% folksy wisdom and 20% gentle teasing. He has a kid who is wise beyond their years and is the main matchmaker.
* **The Contrived Plot Device That Forces Interaction:**
   * **The Car Breaks Down:** Always, always in a charming small town named Hollyton or Evergreen Falls.
   * **The Family Inn/Bakery Is Failing:** And only the city girl's marketing expertise (which she conveniently has, despite being a corporate lawyer) can save it.
   * **The Snow/Weather Event:** A perfectly timed blizzard traps them together in a cozy, overdecorated cabin.
* **The Mid-Movie ""Almost Kiss"" Interruption:** They are staring deeply into each other's eyes, the ambient Christmas music swells... and then the kid walks in with a plate of cookies, or the annoying best friend from the city calls. **Every. Single. Time.**
* **The Third-Act Misunderstanding:** Around the 75-minute mark, one character overhears a highly fragmented piece of dialogue (""...going back to the city..."" or ""...don't need this small town...""), assumes the worst, and runs off into the snow/rain/perfectly manicured main street. The lead must then race to a town festival/tree lighting/cookie contest to profess their love right before the credits roll.
* **The Completely Unnecessary ""No Phones Allowed"" Rule:** They're forced to talk to each other and look at twinkling lights instead of scrolling Instagram. The horror!
* **Every Single Supporting Character Is A Delight:** The mayor, the diner owner, the old lady at the craft store—they are all overly invested in the leads' burgeoning relationship and offer zero conflict.
* **The Climax is Always a Festival:** Tree lighting. Gingerbread competition. Town Winter Gala. The moment of true love is always immediately followed by applause from the entire community.

# Why It Drives Me Nuts (But I Still Watch)

It's not just that the plots are predictable; it's that the characters have zero self-awareness.

**The City Executive:** She needs one weekend in a town with $2 coffee and a lack of Uber to realize her high-powered career and fiancé are hollow. Is career success really the villain here?

**The Charming Small-Town Guy:** His only flaw is that he sometimes works too hard at his quaint, non-profit job. He's *too* good. Give the man a messy divorce or a crippling fear of carousels! *Something!*

I just want one Hallmark movie where the city girl realizes she genuinely loves her job and her fiancé, and the charming baker is actually a secretly bad dude who is using the family inn for a money laundering scheme.

**Anyone else feel like they're watching the same movie over and over, just with different sweater-clad actors? What's your most hated (or secretly loved) trope?**

Let's commiserate!

1picjo5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Bushey_IT_Change/comments/1picjo5/challenges_of_implementing_it_change_stakeholder/,Challenges of implementing IT Change – Stakeholder Buy In,"Following on from our article that identified the **SEVEN** challenges to implementing IT Changes, this is the first, exploring the challenges of Stakeholder Buy In, we will also share some real world experiences of gaining support from Stakeholders/Sponsors in an IT Change. 

The issue that IT Departments have when implementing IT solutions is that too many see the change as an IT change and do not see the bigger challenge and that this involves the business. IT is after all a services department servicing a customer – the Business, and so an IT Change is in effect a Business Change and needs to involve Stakeholders in the Business. 

**Bridging the Gap: Stakeholder Buy-In in the Project Delivery Process** 

In the intricate dance of project management, stakeholder buy-in isn’t just a nice-to-have – it’s the rhythm that keeps everything in sync. Without it, even the most promising projects can stumble and lose their way. Gaining that genuine support, however, often feels like navigating a maze filled with unseen obstacles. 

*We recently undertook an IT Business Change project where the primary stakeholder/ sponsor, the CIO (name and company withheld for obvious reasons), was initially engaged*

*but became isolated from the project. As a pre-requisite of all projects, we produced a detailed proposal laying out our project process, delivery requirements, all the deliverables, outcomes and timeline. The CIO signed up after our sales presentation and we moved to the Project Kick Off Stage (the CIO was not present and had nominated one of this Management Team to represent him) – our Project Governance was presented including the Brief, Scope, Project Schedule and Communications Plan (replicating our proposal). At the end of the meeting, we asked for the Sponsor’s/Stakeholders (now the stand in Sponsor) permission to proceed on the basis of our presentation and documentation. This was duly provided, and we proceeded to implement our Governance structure (regular meetings and regular bi-weekly progress reporting etc. etc.). The Project was a six-month assignment. The project was progressing well and on target until it came to the implementations stage and the local tech team didn’t know how they should implement (this was a documented and agreed pre-requisite of the customer). The CIO called our team into a meeting to understand where we were with the project and then started to ask where deliverables that were not in the Scope were and had never requested were. He became very animated and when he had finished talking he closed the meeting (the last time we ever spoke to him).* 

*After the meeting our Project nominated stand in Sponsor was shocked and apologised – he was fully aware of the situation. There was a full review of all our documentation which stood up to back our delivery promises.* 

*The CIO (ex-Consultant and Project Manager) had not attended any of the Stakeholder meetings held although invited preferring to send his Managers in, we did have a good relationship with all other managers (technical and business). Even dedicated meetings for him were cancelled at the last minute. We published regular reporting, but, we sent SharePoint links to the documents on the Project SharePoint site – but we later learnt that he had not been set up with access.* 

*All of our deliverables were delivered (apart from those that required the organisation’s technical team intervention), we were later to find out key systems which we had been promised were implemented, had not been and there was several months work (including additional costs) to be undertaken to get the platform ready.* 

*We undertook our post meeting Lessons Learned review and it was interesting the key items raised – obviously –* 

*1.    Needed improved communications with the Sponsor* 

*2.    We needed to understand where (in his mind) we had not delivered to his expectations.* 

*3.    Why did the sponsor not have visibility to the regular updates and progress to plan?* 

*Outcomes are that we have now implemented changes in our IT Change process to improve communications with the sponsor and ensure they are informed of progress (both verbally and with clear documentation) and whether they have any comments/directions in return.* 

Back to the IT Department and IT Change – we see most projects fail because either, the Project Manager – 

1.    does not have the experience, knowledge, or confidence to speak to the business stakeholder 

2.    does not have the gravitas to speak to senior business leaders 

3.    is too IT centric and so does not identify business stakeholders as key to the project 

4.    does not understand the key steps in Change Management 

**Engaging Stakeholders – The Hidden Challenges of Securing Buy-In** 

Stakeholders come with diverse perspectives, priorities, and concerns. They’re executives looking at the bottom line, team members juggling workloads, clients with specific needs, and end-users seeking solutions.  

One major hurdle is overcoming the resistance to change. Let’s face it – change can be unsettling. It disrupts the familiar and introduces uncertainty. When stakeholders aren’t convinced of the value a project brings, doubts festers. Key stakeholders stop attending meetings, sending in more junior staff who are not briefed of the project.  

**The Fallout of Missing the Mark with Project slippage** 

Neglecting to secure stakeholder buy-in isn’t just a minor slip-up; it’s a fault line that can trigger earthquakes throughout the project lifecycle. Without buy-in: 

* **Project Objectives Become Blurred**: When stakeholders aren’t aligned, the project’s goals can become a moving target. Conflicting agendas emerge, pulling the project in different directions. 
* **Project Resources Drain**: Lack of support can lead to delays in decisions, causing timelines to stretch and budgets to inflate. 
* **Project Team Demotivation**: Teams sense when the backing and management support is weak. Morale dips, productivity wanes, and that innovative spark dims. I think we have all seen projects go this way in our careers. 

Ultimately, the project risks being shelved – not due to a lack of potential, but because it couldn’t secure the necessary support to thrive. The main reasons for these were that he original business case was not water tight. 

**Turning the Tide to poor engagement** 

So, how do we overcome these challenges? 

It starts with **authentic engagement**. Early and open communication lays the foundation. Instead of presenting a finished plan, involve stakeholders in the ideation phase. Make them co-creators rather than just approvers. This investment in the process builds ownership and enthusiasm. 

Empathy plays a crucial role. Step into their shoes. What keeps them up at night? 

How does this project alleviate their pain points or help achieve their goals? Addressing these questions head-on turns sceptics into advocates. 

We always provide an introduction to the Project but deliberately leave out the detailed how, so we can engage stakeholders in contributing to how they would like it to work in the departments. It also enables Stakeholders to ask questions which we can answer with detailed explanation, providing confidence in the team’s ability to deliver. 

**Looking Forward changing the way we work** 

With our changing world of always on culture – use of collaboration tools can help – understand how the stakeholder would like to keep engaged, do they use email, chat Apps, collaboration tools, SMS…. 

Remember our CIO above, I noticed that he spent all his time on his smartphone rather than his PC – he said early in the discussions at the coffee machine that he prefers working on the smartphone than his PC and our project needed to include the smartphone solution as a key deliverable. 

Our Project Managers need to consider the impact of organisational culture. Cultivating an environment that values transparency and open dialogue which makes the stakeholder engagement a natural part of the process rather than a hurdle to overcome. 

**Beyond the Horizon – How we communicate** 

The one key item I learnt many years ago is telling the story. 

I have never been one for presenting other peoples slides as I do not know their story, and lets face it PowerPoint slides are rarely interesting, but a good story teller is. 

Story telling gains buy-in. Sharing narratives that highlight success, lessons learned, and personal impacts can resonate more than data sheets and projections. People connect with stories – it’s in our DNA. 

Additionally, addressing the “what’s in it for me” factor can shift perspectives. When stakeholders see tangible benefits – for themselves and the broader organisation – their support becomes intrinsically motivated. 

**Final Thoughts** 

At its core, every project is a human endeavour. It’s not just about deliverables and deadlines; it’s about people working together towards a shared vision. Securing stakeholder buy-in is about building relationships founded on trust, respect, and mutual benefit. 

If you’ve faced challenges in this arena, you’re not alone. It’s a complex facet of project management that continues to evolve. 

Remember, every challenge is an opportunity in disguise. By prioritising stakeholder engagement, you’re not only paving the way for project success but also fostering a culture that values collaboration and shared achievement.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

Fast forward to now and I had never felt so tired or low on energy in my entire life. My mood drained the usual. Anyways I was screened again and sure enough persistent low. My GP said my FSH was normal so she suspects it to be testicular related which I had already theorised (more on that shortly). But she wrote on my specialist referral secondary hypogonadism? That doesn’t really make sense right? Anyways as to why I do believe it is primary and testicular related is the fact that my balls have not had a good life. At age 15 I had emergency torsion surgery the ball survived but i’ve had intermittent referral and nerve pain since. That was over 10 years ago now (26). The sensitivity issues I had over that never really went away. I then developed a benign epidermal cyst which whilst is purely an incidental find is quite large and doesn’t help. Then a varicose vein formed on my scrotum too which I believe is what took my levels from somewhat affected to this recent crash. The truth is now since that initial surgery I probably have had issues producing adequate amounts of T in theory. I developed gyno as a teen around the same time too; of course something that didn’t go away either. I am not unfit or overweight now but I wouldn’t say my lifestyle is incredibly healthy either. mostly due to the inclusion of alcohol and bad sleep. Now that I have a somewhat clear picture of why things the way they are my question is whilst I wait to see a specialist is there anything that can help raise my T in the meantime if the issue is in my scrotum? And what is it classed as primary or secondary?

Few notes.
- Haven’t seen an endocrinologist yet.
- aside from gyno look good not as fit as I used to be but no issues with that side of it. 
- fitness is good; 
- I do smoke on and off (cigarettes) and I do drink coffee every day. 
- I get a lot of sunlight i mean heaps for half the year. Take K2 + Vitamin D, fish oil and milk thistle also scoop of magnesium per day in my water bottle. 

I play sport still but haven’t been going to gym because my recovery seems so much slower. Things like jumpers knee and such showing up which I never had before.

Most of us grew up learning about flirting from sitcoms, rom-coms, or worse, TikTok “dating coaches” who think negging is a personality. In 2025, flirting isn’t just confusing, it’s a minefield. From reading signals to navigating text-based banter to avoiding creepy behavior, everyone seems either way too aggressive or paralyzed by the fear of rejection.

I’ve seen it again and again among friends, colleagues, and online communities. People either overshoot (and come off weird or pushy) or they undershoot (and end up in the friendzone forever). This post is the result of deep dives into relationship psychology, behavioral science, top dating podcasts, and lots of painfully awkward Reddit stories. The goal: help you flirt better respectfully, confidently, and without making it weird.

Let’s cut through the BS advice and get into real, data-backed flirting tools that work in today’s culture.

Here are 10 flirting dos and don’ts you wish someone taught you sooner:

1. Mirror their vibe, not your fantasy  
This might sound simple, but a lot of people screw this up. Don’t treat flirting like a performance. If they’re giving you dry, one-word replies, that’s not a green light to double down with more effort. Psychology researcher Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down in her book Captivate. Mirroring someone’s energy and pace builds trust quickly. Flirting is like jazz. It’s not about what you say, it’s about how much you’re picking up their tempo.

2. Don’t overthink your opener  
Forget clever pickup lines. Just making an observation or asking a casual question is good enough. A study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that “simple, direct openers” produced better results than witty or sexual ones. “Hey, I like your jacket,” beats “Are you Google? Because you’ve got everything I’m searching for.” Every. Single. Time.

3. Make eye contact, but don’t stare like a serial killer  
According to Dr. Monica Moore, a psychologist at Webster University, eye contact is one of the strongest nonverbal flirting cues. But there’s a fine line. A conscious, comfortable gaze = flirty. Intense, unbroken eye contact = unsettling. Aim for 3–5 seconds of eye contact with a smile, then break it. Rinse, repeat.

4. Don’t flirt with everyone like it’s a rehearsal  
Flirting isn’t just a game or social experiment. It affects real people with real emotions. Be intentional. In “Come As You Are” by Dr. Emily Nagoski, she explains how arousal and attraction are context-dependent and how random flirting can trigger confusion or discomfort. Don’t use people to test your charm upgrade. That’s how you get labeled creepy.

5. Know the right balance of teasing  
Playful teasing is fine. Mocking someone’s insecurities, hobbies, or serious interests is not. Research from the University of Kansas found that “shared laughter” and “playful teasing” can increase attraction only when it’s clearly mutual. If they’re not laughing with you, they’re cringing at you.

6. Don’t text like a customer service bot  
Too many people flirt over text by being either boring or creepy. Cut the dead conversations like “Hey,” “wyd,” or “how’s your day” with no follow-up. Texting is your chance to show personality. Use voice notes, memes, quirky questions. The best flirting feels like improv. Think of it like a fun game, not a job interview.

7. Body language matters more than you think  
Want to double your flirting skills instantly? Work on your posture. A study from the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin showed that open, expansive body language makes people appear more attractive. Crossed arms, looking at your phone, nervous fidgeting? Major turn-offs. Stand tall. Face them. Use your hands when you talk. Simple, powerful.

8. Don’t “fake it till you make it” with confidence  
True confidence doesn’t mean being cocky. It means being comfortable with yourself, rejection and all. Therapist and podcaster Esther Perel says it best: “Confidence isn’t being told yes all the time. It’s knowing who you are when someone tells you no.” You don’t need a 100% hit rate. You need resilience.

9. Listen louder than you talk  
Most people don’t listen, they wait for their turn to speak. In flirting, active listening = instant attractiveness. Ask follow-ups. Be genuinely curious. According to the Gottman Institute, curiosity and attentiveness are key predictors of long-term romantic success. You’ll stand out just by giving a damn.

10. Don’t mistake friendliness for flirting  
This one’s huge. Be careful with your assumptions. Just because someone is smiling or making eye contact doesn’t mean they’re into you. Dr. David Givens, a behavioral scientist, explains in his research that many “flirting signals” are misread because we project desire where it doesn’t exist. Always test the waters gradually, not with instant intensity.

Now for the tools to actually help you level up your flirting skills:

1. App: “Paired”  
This daily app sends you conversation starters, flirty games, and relationship-building questions based on research from Oxford and UCL. It’s like Duolingo for emotional intimacy. Crazy helpful whether you’re dating or in a relationship. Easy to use, not cheesy.

2. App: “Monaru”  
This one blew my mind. It uses AI to help you remember little details about people like their birthdays, names, and preferences. Want to flirt better? Show that you remember the type of coffee they like or their favorite band. It’s the micro-gestures that matter. Monaru helps you do that without relying on your faulty memory.

3. App: “BeFreed”  
An AI-powered self-growth app built by Columbia grads and ex-Google engineers, BeFreed turns expert books, interviews, and research into personalized audio podcasts matched to your goals. You can tell it what you want to improve like social confidence or dating skills and it creates a structured, adaptive learning plan tailored to you. You can even choose how deep or short each episode is, and switch between calm or smoky voice styles. It recently went viral on X and honestly, it’s a no brainer for any lifelong learner.

4. Book: “Attached” by Dr. Amir Levine and Rachel Heller  
A New York Times bestseller backed by decades of research at Columbia University. It explains why some people play hot and cold while others get clingy. After reading this, you’ll stop taking mixed signals personally. This is the best book I’ve ever read on understanding the psychology behind attraction and dating patterns. Seriously, it changed how I approach everything.

5. Book: “Models” by Mark Manson  
Not your typical “how to get dates” trash. This one focuses on authenticity, emotional vulnerability, and self-respect in dating. It slaps hard if you’re sick of all the manipulative garbage online. Probably the most down-to-earth flirting book out there. An insanely good read.

6. Book: “Captivate” by Vanessa Van Edwards  
She’s a behavioral investigator who’s worked with Google, MIT, and the FBI. This book will make you feel like a social hacker. Full of practical scripts, body language decoding, and chemistry-building hacks. One of the best books to help you become more magnetic in any room.

7. Podcast: “Where Should We Begin” by Esther Perel  
Each episode is an unscripted, anonymous couples therapy session. You’ll learn more about real flirting dynamics, emotional connection, and relationship repair in one episode than a whole season of Love Island.

8. YouTube: The School of Life  
Massive, visually pleasing educational content about relationships, love, and attraction. The videos unearth how our childhood patterns affect our flirting and romantic styles. Especially good if you're into introspective stuff.

9. YouTube: Charisma on Command  
This one breaks down social dynamics in movies, interviews, and real life. Ever wonder why some people have magnetic personalities? This channel dissects that in easy, digestible ways. A goldmine.

Flirting isn’t just about being hot. It’s about being present, authentic, and fun. It’s literally learnable, and way more about psychology than looks. The sooner you get good at this, the more confident and respectful you become, inside and outside of dating.",2,1765298188.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

Feeld is a mess, I get it.

I get wanting to know if someone hasn’t been on in days or weeks but I think this is just adding to overall dating anxiety. 

I recently matched with a guy. My only flag on the profile was something along the lines of “I’ve only met women that want a one night stand”. I’m on several apps, I avoid anything that references “does anyone actually want a relationship anymore?” OLD sucks, and everyone has to be an adult and manage their emotions and reactions. Well I logged in this morning to 3 messages. 2 from midnight and one from a few minutes before I logged on. Basically the first was a lot of questions, which is fair to find out compatibility followed up by another message about feeling free to ask questions back. Then, not even 7 hours later, “are you still there? Still interested?”  I’m pretty sure he saw my profile said Active Today when I really had been on last night. And even then, let’s allow 24 hours for a response, especially if you are asking questions about likes and desires. It’s a little too much for my brain before coffee. I did reply and said 7 hours wasn’t really enough time to respond. He did apologize but the luster had worn off.

For some background on her, She pretends to be mistreated, she walks around angry and ready to start a fight with anyone, and most of us are scared of starting a problem and don’t talk to her or have to walk on eggshells. She is just an extremely reactive person. While i’m still a full time student i’m looking to move out because it has become too much.
Even the other day I was having tea I didn’t realize I had grabbed “her” mug and she comes down yelling and screaming at me that she can’t have her morning coffee anymore, we have a whole shelf of mugs…

Anyways you get the point,
So last night I had opened the window a crack to let some air circulation throughout our room as the heat just pushes to an extreme amount.
I had it open for not even five minutes. She wakes up at 6 to an alarm and immediately starts screaming DONT TOUCH MY WINDOW IM FREEZING(we have one window that can open that happens to be closest to her)
I immediately said sorry and nothing else but she continues talking on and on for ten minutes about how i’m not doing anything and I sleep all day… which is quite literally so far from the truth but she keeps saying she has stuff to do and how productive she is till the point my mom had to come in and remind her we had neighbours and stop screaming. She then goes turns on this big ass light 6AM mind you, starts getting ready and she’s like i’m going to pilates. First time I ever seen her do something like that ever, It’s funny how she was tryna convince me that she’s more productive when she does one class of pilates ever… Anyways she gets home maybe two ish hours later and I was in and out of sleep but i wake up to the sound of tiktok on a speaker. I was already expecting this as she acts like a child but like are we serious? I was like “is there a reason you have to do that on speaker” she responded with to annoy you. SHES TURNING TWENTY THREE IN A FEW WEEKS 
sorry i’m rambling cuz it’s constantly a problem 

I could go on about how abusive she is and how she gets too but honestly i’m more pissed about the petty shit cuz it’s so unnecessary

I don't usually write something like this..But i want to do it for the first time so here we go.

From November 20th to November 27th, I spent seven unforgettable days in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. I didn’t expect this trip to impact me and my life the way it did, but it truly became one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.

My dad and uncles who was Ex Saudi peoples used to warn me ""those peoples are theif theyll scamm you be careful..""etc... starting from my Visa process to landing in ALG airport it was a roller-coaster of emotions on how to handle things. 


I landed on the airport without knowing either arabic or English..and no idea how to reachh to places here...it was just me and my ""hasbunallahu wa ni'mal wakeel ""

But...

From the very moment I stepped out of the airport i started getting people who were sent by god to take care of me..First guy was Fakher..an airport staff kind enough to help me find the cheapest way and easiest way of transport....he was so happy to know that I was a solo traveler and took pictures anol..then I went to a cafe next to the airport.. had some coffee...the owner of the cafe...that gentleman refused to take my money when he understood i was a traveler. Then I asked him how to reach my destination..just to double confirm the best way.. After seeing the map location..without wasting a second he stepped out of the cash counter and took me to the metro station and helped me get tickets and talked to the metro pilot to take care of me....and this pilot... he came to me before every station stops to tell me ""don't get out... this is not your station"".

Then after reaching at Agha station found 2 young guys who is doing MBBS...may Allah make the great doctors and gave the good health.. so these 2 young guys ..... they helped me get to my AIRBNB... and literally got me food.... like bruh . I am 25 year old grown ass guy...and these young guys are making sure am comfortable here...one guy was from Sahara...and the other was from west ..Not telling their names... .. and the also  came next day on Friday.. to show me around...  and again offered me buy me food... I insisted...and they let me pay half...but they said something """"We are only letting you pay half because also don't have money, just FYI if we were working or if you were with anyone who has a job they'd never let you pay.."" and these 2 showed me around... my 3 days plan.. they helped me finish in one day.. from grand mosque to Hamma to the War Monument....everything....such sweet guys.

I am a guy who never likes when someone pay for me. I always make sure to give my part of zakat and generous to my best. I never expected so much love from people who barely knows me. I was restricting myself from accepting things for free cz i don’t want to take things for granted...

And on the next day.. i met someone else... a lady...oh my dearest sister...i hope you are doing great.. and may you be among those people who are  dearest to Allaah. Such sweet woman.... she decided to show me around and buy me food and spent the day with me...she is the kind of person who will become a great mom...AND ..AND... SHE MADE ME LOCAL SWEETS....yes...she literally made it for me..and have it to me on the last day.. i call her my lost sister..🤣🤣..she really is God's favorite child....

Each day I'd get getting someone to accompany me... and the very moment they comes to know i am tourist... BOOM... instant love and hospitality...

Oh dear Algeria, you have suffered alot in the past. The history melts my heart each time hearing the 
Story of torture. May you cherish again..

I know alot of Algerians don’t like guest..especially a guy from india... but thank you for taking care of me... from Fakher to the homeless old woman who blessed me...

I will never forget you..

Although someone really broke my heart...but it is okay.... maybe in another life (if there is any)they don't break mine again.... or may i get reunited in aakhira with them..until then..you take care...


Once again... Thank you for your hospitality.... I will come back ..but next time i will make sure I will open up something that will bring wealth to the struggling youth in this country. 

May Allah protect you all.♥️

1pibwoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Ok_Fall_8916/comments/1pibwoq/how_automation_simplifies_retail_operations/,How Automation Simplifies Retail Operations (Without the Headache),"Running a retail business today feels like you’re managing a hundred moving parts -

#  💻 Checking online orders

#  📦 Updating stock

#  📠 Balancing accounts

#  💬 Answering messages

By the time you finish one thing, another needs your attention.  
 You’re not short on motivation - you’re short on hours.

The real issue?  
 **Too many tools, not enough connection.**

Your systems don’t talk to each other, so you’re stuck doing the talking - one manual update at a time.



⚙️ 1. The Problem: Retail Tools That Don’t Work Together

You’ve got your POS for sales, an Excel sheet for stock, a CRM for customers, and an accounting app for finances.  
 Individually, they work great.  
 Together? Chaos.

You copy data from one place to another, hoping you don’t make a mistake.  
 You spend more time *managing tools* than managing your store.

When your systems don’t connect, you don’t just lose time - you lose clarity.



⏱️ 2. The Hidden Cost: Decisions Made Too Late

Imagine you’re running out of a top-selling product, but your sales app and inventory tracker aren’t linked.  
 You only realise you’re out of stock *after* customers start asking for it.

That’s not just a missed sale - it’s a missed opportunity.

Automation solves this by giving you **real-time visibility**.  
 When data updates automatically across systems, you can act fast - restock early, catch trends, and keep customers happy.



💡 3. The Shift: From Manual to Effortless

Think of automation as your silent team member - the one who never forgets, never sleeps, and never makes a typo.

With connected workflows, every action triggers another automatically:

* A sale updates your stock  
* A customer receives a thank-you email  
* The data syncs to your accounts  
* A report generates automatically  

It’s like running your business on autopilot - but you stay in full control.

The shifts are 8 to 12 hours long and I’m standing basically the entire time with other light physical activity involved. There is also a lot of walking involved in my commute— over an hour total per day. I don’t even eat much in a day because I don’t really have the money or time to do so. I don’t calorie count but there was a stretch of about a week where I was eating next to nothing every day (I know it’s not healthy, but I didn’t have a choice). 

I am motivated to lose weight and am trying to do so, but my schedule doesn’t really allow for time to go to the gym, and since my daily grind is so tiring I don’t even have the energy for it / it would only make my workday worse. 

Hopefully one day I’ll be able to get back into the gym and develop a more healthy exercise routine. For now, though, why is it that constant  moving / walking / low calorie intake is not budging my weight at all? What can I do to my daily life to help me reach my weight loss goal (when I have barely any free time)? For context, I am overweight and used to live a more sedentary lifestyle that caused weight gain. Why is this change to a very active day-to-day routine not impacting my physical health? 

edit for more info about the food I eat in a day: I usually have a black coffee at breakfast time, a bowl of (broth based) soup for lunch, and something like a sandwich at the end of the day. I don’t feel like it’s overboard, just very basic “get through the day” type food. For the period of time that I ate ‘next to nothing’ that I mentioned, that was literally like… a few oreos a day (unhealthy, I know, but it was just the only food I had in the house at the time and I was working so much)",0,1765297706.0,loseit,23,0.38,False

My getting stuff done time falls during his sporadic naps and after he goes to sleep for about 2 hrs. 

Here are a few things I do but I want to hear from other moms and get more ideas! It feels impossible to accomplish even half of my tasks without doing this. 

- pumping while doing an upper body work out - allows me to be up right and pump 
- pumping and vacuuming
- stroller walk and audiobook to learn and educate myself on baby development 
- squats with baby during a wake window here and there 
- go to bed with no dishes
- baby wear while vacuuming but he only lets me do about 30 mins a day and sometimes I’m spending it doing other stuff - tidying up in general, wrapping Christmas gifts, etc 
- having my morning coffee while I give him his first bottle  

I still struggle to get a full pump session in, work out, and keep a tidy house. I do manage to eat but I am always scarfing food down which is fine. I’d like to find ways to get stronger and more physically fit and also keep my house cleaner and more tidy. 

Going to the gym or having a dedicated hour to myself just not possible at this time. My husband works late a lot, and it’s important to us that we eat together, so I’m usually starving when he gets home and need to eat and THEN would have to go work out at 8pm and that really screws with my sleep.

1. The charts were basically screaming at me: Buy now!

MSFT at the time showed:

https://preview.redd.it/ykppjwp2e76g1.jpg?width=815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46260e2d8fafad6a345cf72094530fa632eafb50

Bollinger Band compression → Big move brewing

MACD momentum strengthening → Buying pressure arriving

RSI divergence → Price makes a new low but RSI refuses to follow

This triple-signal pattern even impressed my wife, who said,

""Hmm, it looks like it's really going to go up.""

She doesn't trade at all.

2. Microsoft isn't just a ""tech stock""; it's the foundation of AI infrastructure.

While others are still debating which AI startups will win,

Microsoft already:

has Azure (a money-making machine),

is betting on OpenAI,

has integrated AI into its entire ecosystem,

has stable cash flow, and

its CEO doesn't engage in questionable practices.

In the AI ​​gold rush, they're selling the tools.

Why wouldn't you buy?

3. Excellent risk-reward ratio.

My entry points: Clear stop-loss level; ample upside potential; near 3:1 risk-reward ratio. Even if it weren't Microsoft, I would have made this setup.

But since it's Microsoft?

I clicked ""Buy"" with the same composure as drinking my third cup of coffee.

https://preview.redd.it/el7i4cmje76g1.png?width=3000&format=png&auto=webp&s=57825197723da7e4196961391a5745a4110e9ae3

4. Institutional funds were clearly accumulating positions quietly at that time.

Trading volume, blockchain transactions, a gradual upward trend... typical signs of large investors.

No insider information needed, just the ability to read the charts.

5. Microsoft is a company that won't do anything foolish.

Some companies are like a 22-year-old romantic interest: chaotic, impulsive, and unpredictable.

Microsoft is more like a highly reliable elementary school teacher: stable, dependable, and doesn't mess around.

I like this kind of quality when dealing with large sums of money.



In short, this deal went very well...

https://preview.redd.it/08glgg68f76g1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3367c63792c09d8b232acfab443a4d243bb62ae4

I didn't predict the AI ​​era, but the metrics are up to par, the logic is sound, and the risk-reward ratio is excellent.

Just follow the rules.

Now is the time to casually say, ""I told you so."" Lol

Hi everyone,
I wanted to share my experience because maybe someone out there can benefit from it or at least feel less alone.

My first panic attack happened about five months ago. That day I had two coffees and an energy drink, and honestly I didn’t expect that mix to hit me so hard. After a while I suddenly felt like I was going to pass out. My heart started racing, my breathing got fast, and I felt a kind of fear I had never experienced before — it really felt like I was dying.

I went to the hospital, did some tests, and they told me everything was fine. But my mind couldn’t accept that.

After that first attack, the panic kept repeating for a few weeks, and then slowly started to fade. But afterwards, I began to get intrusive thoughts and random fears that didn’t feel like they belonged to me. Any word I heard or read would get stuck in my head for no reason — even the word “suicide” stayed in my mind for a whole week just because I had read it somewhere, even though I have nothing to do with that topic.

During that period I was also preparing to move abroad, and I eventually moved from Morocco to Spain. But even after arriving here, the fear was still around me and I was trying to adapt.

With time things got better. The strong panic attacks stopped, and only mild intrusive thoughts stayed, much less than before.

Until today…

I was about to sleep, and I started thinking about my childhood — what I lived through, how I grew up… I went too deep into my thoughts, to the point where it felt like my mind couldn’t think anymore. And suddenly, out of nowhere, the same feeling as the first attack hit me: a strong wave of fear, rapid heartbeat, and that sensation of “I’m about to collapse.”

The attack didn’t last long, just a few minutes, but it was intense and brought back memories of the very first time it happened. I got out of bed, walked around the house, moved a bit, and it started to calm down.

Now I still feel a bit scared, and of course these questions keep coming to my mind:
– Why did it come back after 5 months?
– Is this normal?
– Should I see a doctor, or should I just continue facing it on my own?

I’d like to hear from people who went through something similar — how did you deal with it and how did you overcome these kinds of panic episodes?",1,1765297303.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

1pibmec,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pibmec/just_a_man/,Just A Man,"CW: >!Terminal Illness, Themes of Suicide, Loss!<

Reflections in the corner of my eye bore the shape of my tormentor. Always in the corner, always waiting. Most visible in the reflection, be it a mirror, or one of my father's polished shoes. I saw *It* in the tears my mother shed at my father's funeral. I saw *It* in the consoling eyes of my aunt when my Mother left us. I witnessed *It* in my daughter's, too, when my wife joined them.

I did not realise until the morning of September 2nd, almost two years ago now, that I was being assailed.

I walked down those stairs as I always did. Muttering and cursing, especially as I missed the final step and caught myself by the banister with a hand ever lined with age. My slippers were still there, which, at the time, was a rarity, but not altogether a concern. Lucy liked to grab one and sleep with it. I gave little attention to the discrepancy, and proceeded into the kitchen, flicking the kettle on and pouring the cheap instant powder into my cup. I did not bother to dirty a spoon; I had always preferred to pour straight from the container. Neither did I let a kettle boil all the way; my mother said it was bad luck. Not that she had been particularly lucky, in the end.

My wife always commented on my superstitions. I put up with it, what with her beauty. She had always been beautiful. Even her name had been. But, I could not recall it so early in the morning. Things often escaped me, even then.

I lifted the kettle, yawned, and poured; my groggy state made me miss the cup once or twice, but the brunt of the water made its way onto the powder. That acrid burned coffee drifted into my nose in coils. I sighed, deeply, letting the mere suggestion of caffeine re-invigorate me. I held it up, blowing the drifting vapour, and passed into the living room. As usual, my eyes went straight to the sofa. An old thing, with deep indents where I usually sat, and absolutely no signs of life on the other side. It also looked undisturbed, which was a nice surprise while it lasted. Lucy liked to steal cushions when she was lonely.

‘Morning, Lucy,’ I’d groaned, looking over to the corner. Curled up, as ever, had been my dog. She lifted her head, and it was with that low, pained whine that I realised something was wrong. My heart sank, but at that point I did not despair. I approached her, smiling, and offered the back of my hand; she licked it, weakly, offering that same smile of bared teeth she had learned as a puppy, before replacing her head on her bed. *It* was in her eyes.

I reasoned she may have been tired. I called her a good girl, and scratched her ear, before moving over to her dish and dropping in a cup full of her food. With that familiar clang, every other morning, I had needed to chastise her for rushing before I said to go.

She did not even twitch.

I brought the bowl toward her. ‘Too lazy for that now, huh girl?’ Lucy had lifted her head, sniffed the bowl once, and then let her head drop back down to her leather bed she so loved to gnaw. ‘Please… please. Don’t do this to me,’ I’d whispered, crouching down to kiss her snout, an action I detested for its lack of hygiene. She licked my face, but it was a laboured movement.

I got her lead and wasted no time in taking her to the car. I thanked God she was strong enough to stand and walk; ‘perhaps it’s just a queasy stomach,’ I’d thought, ‘I’m being stupid.’ I had even played with the idea of taking Lucy for a walk, a quick one, up to the woods and beside the cliff, just before taking her to the stuffy vet. I’d decided against it, in the end, but had promised Lucy a long, long walk, if she promised to get better.

The drive to the vet had been undramatic. I’d been tapping my hands on the wheel, periodically checking on Lucy. She was very well behaved; God, I wish she hadn’t been. I wished she had chewed through the remaining seat belts that had not yet suffered her wrath, I wished she’d have stuck her head forward and licked my face.

But she didn’t.

The Vet was sympathetic. Told me how it was after a fairly quick scan. She even teared up a little. My dog was not old, but too old to risk an operation. Apparently it would have been hurting Lucy long before today. She just hadn’t shown it. Dogs could be brave companions.

It’s not a nice thing to witness, and not a nice thing to describe. The room was square, and my Lucy had laid down on a bright blanket. The Vet asked me if I was ready. I said I was, and told Lucy she was a good girl and that I loved her. I held her head so that she saw I was there. I needed her to know I was there. I sat there with her, and held her head until it faltered, drooped, and went limp.

My parents had not been enough. My wife had not been enough. Cancer had decided it needed my dog, too.

Everyday I wake up, see my slippers undisturbed, and remember Lucy. Her hair is not yet gone from the carpets, her scent still lingers but is fading by the day, and each morning I go to move her bed I stop myself because she'd be upset.

I called my daughter a week after Lucy went. She was as distraught as I was, and worried for me, of course. An older man alone in a house too big, and too quiet for him. Ella is calling more often. A small benefit to poor Lucy's passing. It seemed to remind her that I was a human being, too, not just her father. But that's not important.

No, it was the month after Lucy died that I have to talk about. Because that's where it began. Where it, became *It*, and I knew I had never been alone in this house.

Halloween. All the lights were off, and the home undecorated for the first time since I moved there. I can be forgiven, I think, not wishing to celebrate. I did leave a bowl of sweets out, though, to satiate the masses, or one greedy child. I considered watching a scary film out of tradition, but my living room felt so empty without Lucy.

I got an early night. I didn't sleep, exactly; I lay there, staring at the white ceiling, streetlight dancing across it, wondering why I had never let Lucy sleep in my bed. Grief did that, I supposed; made you regret all the decisions you made, all the time you spent elsewhere, all the declined walks and rest days. All the times you went away, and used a kennel. All the times you chastised them, or made them whimper.

It was sometime after that I found myself in the day room. Crackling fire, room dusted and swept. When did I do that? When did I light the fire? A fragrance burned from a candle that haemorrhaged money with each second it remained lit.

Lucy lifted her head to me, eyes sparkling in the firelight. I wasted no time in showering her with kisses and calling her a good girl. I said I was sorry for not taking her on that final walk, and I offered to take her there and then. But, it was clear she was too comfortable in the fire's heat.

I scratched her belly as she rolled onto her back, her legs kicking with joy. I laughed, smiling for the first time in that long month.

Then, I saw her. Sat near the corner, too far for the fireplace to fully illuminate but enough to make out her silhouette. She was smiling at us, and I smiled back. There was something wrong, I knew that, something off. It was my wife, of course; the thought that she had been dead for five years now did not seem to disturb me.

She did not say anything. Perhaps because I had forgotten her voice. That unnatural smile bore the signs of a distant memory, a faded photograph that once bore such love.

Playing with Lucy, I didn't noticed the dark hallways that did not seem to be empty, or the fading light of the fire, despite its ample fuel. I was with my dog again; why would I care about the dying light? I could feel Lucy's fur beneath my fingers for a long time after I was plunged into darkness. All I could do was frown at the smile in the corner, and tell Lucy how much I loved her. Those hands on my shoulders, so familiar, yet so warped. Slithering down me like liquid, yet solid all the while.

*It* was saying hello.

I woke up, crying and sputtering, that ache of losing Lucy all over again ripping my heart in two. Eyes burning, I rolled over, wiping them in my pillow. In truth, I was grateful; I had been allowed to see my dog again.

It felt like a gift from God. Another meeting on the night where the ""gap"" between the living and the dead was bridged. A meeting with my dog, a chance to apologise and remind her again how much she was loved.

*It*, though, made me wonder if the dream was a gift from God, or one of his fallen sons?

In the light of day that notion seemed ridiculous.

The headaches started after that. I left the house, at first, to beat away the agony. My feet took me on that well trod path up to the woods. There was no force tugging at my arm, no burn in the palm where the energetic dog had once pulled ever forward. No disturbance or pause while Lucy sniffed at a leaf, or tree trunk. I remembered the morning after Halloween with a clarity I wish I could forget; not for what was to come, or the feeling of being watched.

But for the reminder that I never took Lucy here before her last sleep.

Fallen trees, held up by steeled ivy, lined the mushed leaves. Sentinels to an old man's tears. I felt it within, beside the hollowness. Anger.

But also clarity. A clarity that came with that stabbing pain in my temples.

*It* was there, in the corner of my eye. *It* watched, *It* waited. I was next. *It* wanted me now.

I broke my hand that day. Fractured bones I didn't know I had. The pisiform and distal ulna, apparently. The tree bore only the traces of my skin and blood. A great arcing thing, with orange leaves still clinging desperately to the branches.

*It* wanted me.

I noticed *It* everywhere after that. After the X-ray of my arm, there was an impression, nothing more. The slight sheen on the doctor's badge, cheerfully reading ""HI, MY NAME IS"" emblazoned on a cheap, yet polished, metal. I could only see *It* at certain angles, but that was enough to know I was not deluded.

I realised now, in my memories, that I had been seeing *It* all my life.

When I was a child, I begged my mother to take the mirror out of my room. In the corner, adjacent to my bed by quite a distance, though ever present. Each time I lay on my back, every time I opened my eyes, I saw *It*.

Amazing, how a child's fears are so often dismissed. How the dark shapes are nothing more than the imagination playing tricks. How an adult can look back on their fear and laugh.

But *It* wanted me.

'Nothing to be worried about.' I have heard that every year, routinely, from the Doctor. Every year I think I am doomed to that final laugh. At that point, it was four months after Halloween, and my hand was almost completely mobile. My headaches were worsening, but I knew if I said anything I would be forced to wait for hours to get a scan.

I thanked the Doctor. When was *It* going to take me? *It* grew larger, ever encroaching. Surely *It* would make a move soon?

'Coward,' I remember whispering as I walked beside the hospital. *Its* form shook in each dark window. I thought *It* was angry. I know now that *It* was simply laughing.

Ella called me the day after that. December 5th. A shaky voice. She had gone for something likewise routine, apparently. Amazing, how sweet a Doctor could be. How kind, and helpful they are, when explaining something. They said they had caught It early. They said that was good. That *It* could be beaten.

I sat in my room, staring at the mirror from the corner of my eye. *It* returned my gaze. Perhaps *It* was expecting fear, perhaps *It* was expecting me to move. A cruel visage deserves no fear. I would not be afraid. How dare *It* try and take her.

I made sure to sleep on my back, every night, and keep the mirror firmly in my peripheral. I would fall asleep looking at *It*, in a bed *It* emptied. I would awaken, each morning, to the terrible form. I would smile at *It*.

I would not be afraid. I would not be anguished. I would be strong.

I made my coffee. I took my walk. And I plotted. I plotted, and schemed. Let me become Brutus, Judas, Machiavelli. Let me bask in the idea of defeating *It*. Every morning, I would take my walk. Lucy's absence never went unnoticed, but her memory brought a smile rather than a tear. *It* would fail.

That defiance remained for a few months. Never again did I dream of loved ones. I dreamed only of darkness. But *It* lay within, standing before me. An unseen hand against either cheek, pushing as if a vice.

I laughed. My waking hours were worse than any torture *It* could muster in the realm of dreams.

The whirring of the clippers still echoes in my ears. Ella's hair, once so bright and luscious, covered my floor. She had wanted me to do it. I managed without crying, even though Lucy's bed still remained in the corner of my eye. *It* was there, too, of course; in the reflection of a picture of Ella, on her thirteenth birthday, playing with Lucy.

'Beautiful,' I smiled at her eyes. They still twinkled, though *It* was within the green sheen.

'Cover girl worthy,' she put the hat on, for the first time. Knitted, in a vile shade of yellow. One of her mother's laziest efforts. 'Don't forget my appointment tomorrow. Make sure to write it down, please.'

'I'm old, not senile.'

'Could have fooled me.'

Ella's friends raised money, and ran, as they always did in these circumstances. In this time, I couldn't help but feel bitter. They made my daughter's suffering a personal achievement for themselves?

Looking back, I was harsh. They just wanted to help. They wanted the same as me; they wanted *It* dead.

I lived my life in rage, and in love. Love, when I was with Ella, who suddenly seemed willing to spend time with me. Rage, every other waking second. I went to the Hospital with her for every appointment. She wasn't meant to drive, just in case.

There was one corridor I spent most of my time waiting. It was designed to entertain children, yet it bore my darkest steps. The bent mirrors and warped images. I followed, back and forth, while they saw to my child, earning strange looks from nurses and HCAs, and all the assorted visitors. *It* walked beside me. Like an old friend. Like we were Comrades.

Ella put up with my moods. The scans had been good. The radiation was beating *It* back. *It* was getting smaller, and they believed they were out of the woods. So close.

'You hear that,' I remember whispering that night. 'You're losing.' *It* seemed to swell in the reflection. Like a strange indignation. I smiled.

*It* punished me with headache after headache. I forgot small things, at first. Like to pick up hand-soap, or to take my vitamins. I missed my influenza vaccine.

It took me a few weeks to realise I could no longer recall my wife's name without straining. *It* continued to mock me every time I rose. No longer did it need reflections; *It* remained stuck in the corner of my eye.

I didn't care. *It* had lost. My Ella would be okay.

Pride goes before the fall. Oh, how I wish the fall had been my own; the pride certainly had been. Ella had warned me against peaking so resolutely, so confident in *It's* defeat.

*It* spread. From primary, secondary, tertiary. Bone, to breast, to lung.

That stench of cleanliness. That pristine Doctor. She had been in the hospital for two weeks. A last ditch effort, they said. Maybe there was a chance of recovery. But I saw *It*, and knew that mortal men were not yet prepared for such a demon.

And, I was right.

Ella and I cried, discussing the plans for the after. She wanted a funeral that was colourful. I told her that was ridiculous, and she laughed. The laugh was still hers.

'You have to, it's what I want.'

'You won't get a say,' I said. I burst into tears as soon as I said it. She comforted me, laughing.

'I'll be with mum. I'll even walk Lucy until you come to take her back.'

'That'll be the day. You never walked her,' I said, smiling. 'You never got up in time.'

'Just shows you how serious I am.'

A week later, the pristine doctor returned, carrying his clip-board scythe, and notes on his doomed patients. He was there to explain a device they had set up. A box, with a lot of components, that led to my daughter's arm.

'This helps with the pain,' the doctor said. 'The Morphine varies in strength. I have to warn you that it will make you less and less... lucid. It's meant to take away all the pain you're feeling until you...'

'Until I die?' Ella said, with a small smile.

'Yes,' the doctor nodded. I saw through the sadness in the doctor's eyes. He was too used to this to truly care. He could not afford to be anything but detached.

'Will I know?' Ella had said, voice tinged with fear and shaking that threatened to break her brittle bones.

'No.'

'Dad?' She looked at me. I nodded, and took her hand. I did my best to hold in my tears. Her friends were there, all trying to do the same to varying degrees of success. 'Don't leave. Not until I go.'

'I won't.'

'Promise?' She looked so afraid in those moments.

'I promise.'

The box was switched on. Ella could converse with us all, for an hour or so after.

'You should find yourself a jacket, dad,' she said. 'It's cold in here. Make sure to get him a jacket, he never takes care of himself. Where's that nurse, she seemed nice. She'll get you a jacket... Maybe two... Mum would have knitted you such an ugly... No sense... Weather is nice though... I'm glad it isn't rain... I can't stand the rain...' Her head had begun to falter. It soon drooped. Then, she slipped into sleep.

They reduced my daughter to ash a week later. Ella would have loved her day. So many colours, so many memories.

I smiled and hugged all of my daughter's friends when they came up to me. I could no longer recall a single one of their names, but had the fortune of remembering their support for Ella. That was all I needed.

I finished my daughter's last wishes. I overlooked the handing out of her items, and I gave her friends everything she had owned and left at her family home. I stared at a small container of her baby teeth for hours.

I retained only two remnants of her brief adult life; the ugly hat, and a vial of her perfume.

Then, I was left here, alone in my house looking at her urn.

I could feel *It*. Gnawing, and looming. *It* had won, and *It* wanted the grand prize. I had been tenderised, and beaten. I saw *It* in all the immensity of the abyss, for what it truly was. Black in the corner of my eye. *It* wanted me. *It* desired my heart, my blood.

I took in a final breath of Lucy's scent, now so weak it was surely my imagination. I picked up my daughter. I left the house.

*It* followed me. *It* got closer, encroaching on my retinas. I walked. I walked, through the woods. I stopped, as Lucy would have, at each tree. Life really was beautiful; the rain that drips from the leaves, the soil that holds writhing worms beneath dazzling wild-flowers.

I kept on walking. I followed the path, the same path I always took. Where else would it have ended?

*It* had taken everything. *It* would take no more.

The salt met my nose, and I smiled. The wind buffered my skin, and the cry of gulls sang above. I scattered my daughter atop that dazzling cliff. Ella loved the sea.

I placed my feet right against the edge.

I had loved this life. I had loved those in it.

*It* crept up, curious, and filling my peripheral like two dark hands about to cover my eyes.

'They lived. You can't take that. You can't take the impact they left on the world, you can't take the impact they left on me. You can't even survive without us. You are *Nothing*.' I clutched the ugly hat to my chest.

*It* trembled, and withdrew slightly. I could see the majesty of the water far below, the startling blues and greens. For all that beauty, Ella's eyes would have rivalled it with ease.

I am no Machiavelli. I am no Brutus. I am just a man.

Funny, that word: just. There was no just about it.

*It* seemed confused. As if the growing dark should be striking fear into my heart. But, why would I be afraid? I was going to walk my dog.
