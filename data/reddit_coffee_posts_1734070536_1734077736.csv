After seeing countless brands burn money on market research to figure out who else might buy their product, I've noticed a really simple way that works better -- collaborating with influencers, or observing their posts.

These methods cost way less than traditional market research and give you real-time feedback from actual potential customers.

Let me break down what I've seen work:

**1) Cross-Language Testing**

Find an influencer type that works well in your main market

Look for similar influencers in other languages/regions

Watch how different cultures use your product differently

Example: Our coffee thermos marketed for ""morning commutes"" in the US became popular for ""picnic wine"" in France. We usually use the getsaral app to find influencers quickly.

**2)  Controlled Testing**

Send products to different types of influencers (like 5-10 in each category). Keep follower counts similar so you can compare properly.

Watch the comments and see which type of influence got you the most sales. Their audience is your new target market.

*I've got some email templates that worked really well with influencers when doing outreach. Let me know in the comments if you want them.*

**3) Multi-Platform Observation**

Watch how the same product discussion changes across platforms - each one has its own little community with different needs.

For example, when we looked at matcha influencers, Instagram mainly reached wellness and health folks, Twitter had all these writers using it as their work drink, and on TikTok, it was mostly students using it for study sessions. Same product, but each platform's influencers naturally attracted completely different customers.

1hd7klp,https://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/1hd7klp/for_the_first_time_in_26_years_i_am_excited_for/,"For the first time in 26 years, I am excited for Christmas. ","This will be my first Christmas without my parents / grandparents/ siblings, my first Christmas with my husband and is also incidentally promising to be the best Christmas of my life. 

I got married in August. I (26-27F) met him (25M) last year but we didn’t spend last year’s Christmas together as I flew back to my home country. This is going to be our first one together, just the two of us. 

We were originally planning to travel to either his home country or mine for Christmas but because Canada Post has been on strike for a month now we never received our PR cards in time (sigh) so we are unable to leave the country. I was initially bummed about is but now I just feel like this was a blessing in disguise. 

In all my life so far, my Christmases with my family have ranged from « meh » to horror story straight out of r/AITAH. I never had a « good » Christmas, meaning that I could remember as a happy moment. At best it was boring. Usually it was disappointing. Worse ones have been extremely tense or sad. I was always either in bed at 8 or crying all night or both. 

Ive never understood the « Christmas spirit » or the whole excitement for Christmas particularly as a young kid. I was always very bitter and disillusioned about the whole magic of Christmas (insert vomit here), felt it was just commercial bullshit. I never ever looked forward to it, more to January when all that sentimental hypocrisy would finally be over. Advent calendars ? Forget it. Cards ? Was compelled to write them. Presents ? Didn’t really care, knew they would be disappointing. Family? What an ordeal. 

Until this year. 

Starting from November, I have felt this huuuge rush of excitement in my heart imagining what I’d put together for my husband’s presents. What’s more, I got overwhelmed with curiosity about MINE !!! Now the wait is just killing me and I am almost crying of happiness every time that he forbids me to go to our storage unit downstairs cause I know he got stuff hidden there. 

I’ve spent countless hours researching and imagining the best possible presents, crafting some of them, wrapping them, decorating them, writing cards. I just can’t get enough of candles, decorations, Christmas cookies recipes, all that cheap commercial crap that was making me vomit all my life is now just making my eyes tear and my heart melt.

I came up with an idea for an Advent project to do together, I bought 48 cute Christmas gift labels and everyday we’re both writing down something we like about our life or each other and sticking it on the wall in our room. On Christmas morning we’ll read all of them together. Just seeing our wall getting covered with these stupid Santa stickers fills my heart with joy every instant. 

I’ve spent weeks testing and perfecting recipes for our Christmas dinner. We have planned everything for our Christmas day, going out for a walk to our favorite coffee shop, snow fighting, snowman building, making and enjoying our dinner just the two of us, then Church and cuddling, and the next morning opening our stickers and presents. Does it sound like the most disgustingly cliche feel-good Christmas movie to you? Yup, that’s absolutely the gist. 

Speaking of those Christmas movies… they used to disgust me so much (and they still do, ugghhh) but for some weird reason I just can’t seem to get enough of them. Every night, yes, every single night we are watching a different one. My husband is laughing at me and at my supposedly educated artistic taste. 

It’s been more than a month now that I just - can’t - wait - for - Christmas. I am genuinely overwhelmed with joy at the thought of that day just the two of us at home. I am crying of happiness just writing this. I guess that’s what Christmas was supposed to be about all along, right? Real, true, faithful (and sometimes cheesy) love.

","Tara would’ve given her life at that moment to have another hour in bed. Unfortunately, it wasn’t what the God’s decreed as a good trade. For that, she’d cancelled her phone’s alarm, dragged herself into the shower, dressed, and now her electric toothbrush was drowning out the rapping on the bathroom door, though it did muffle the voice flowing through.



She couldn’t understand them, but she got the gist.



“*Oming*,” she called back with the brush to the back of her throat, looking lazy-eyed in the cabinet mirror where her brown hair ran long either side her face, and her blue school shirt messily sitting about her shoulders. As she spat and ran the tap, she buttoned up and corrected her hair’s centre parting to the side, sourcing a stray clip to push one side of her bangs behind her ear.



She paused to consider makeup. She had some and it was all good quality, but she pursed her lips at the thought of being stuck before a mirror for half an hour. Rather, she trudged on out, taking the stairs to her immediate left opposite three bedroom doors, and went down into the open plan kitchen-cum-living room decorated rather sterile with mute blues, warm greys, and largely contemporary style. It was spacious, with a corner sofa before a wall-mounted television bathed in light from the bay window. Tucked off to the other side of the front door was their small kitchen with a round breakfast table cluttered in cups, a cafetiere, and baby toys.



“Ah! She hath risen!” Mum said from the kitchen table, her hair naturally wavy but set it into even tighter curls that morning. She was already dressed in her office attire with full make up and jewellery, looking devilishly official for a woman of forty. Still, she scowled as she struggled to get her one-year-old son, Momo, into his high chair. He trilled and squealed as he kicked his chubby legs.



“She wasn’t in there that long,” her step dad said from the table where he was eating breakfast, his Indian accent a delicate touch on his sophisticated speech. He sounded educated, but he still did those little head wobbles as he asked, “Did you even wash?”



As Tara swooped by, she dropped a kiss on his temple. He hummed as if knowing she was buttering him up.



“Kinda,” she said. As she passed mum, she instead gave her a kiss on the lips, which made Mum blink hard. “Needed some lippy,” Tara said as she slapped her lips together. “Couldn’t be bothered to get my gel stick.”



Mum scowled, but it was another voice from off into the conservatory at the back of the living room that said, “You’re fifteen. You don’t wear make up!”



“Good job, Dad,” Tara said, looking at him whilst feeding bread into the toaster. “You’re getting really good at throwing your voice.”



James, her 21-year-old brother, came around the corner with a bemused expression. Wearing his usual gym clothes and his hair slicked back, he drove many of the girls wild, until he opened his mouth at least. All he seemed to do was lecture people, which made him perfect for his career as a personal trainer.



“You need to get your priorities in order,” he said, glancing at the clock as he slid on his fitness watch.



“Talking about priorities,” Tara said as she slid the barely brown toast onto her plate and sat between Mum and Dad. “Jad wants to book the train tickets today. I’m good for that, right?”



Mum had just managed to get Momo’s bib on when she paused at that statement. The exchange of looks between her parents said it all, but it annoyed her more when they then glanced to James like he was some sort of deciding factor. Before he could weigh in, she said, “Oh, don’t bother then. It’s only been planned for the last three months, it doesn’t matter.”



“*Ta*!” James snapped at her snarky attitude.



“James,” Mum whispered.



Tara rolled her eyes at their weird family dynamic, but it was Dad who leaned in, looking at her with his puppy dog eyes. “Think you might be able to push it back into August? I know it’s a month late for your birthday, but-”



“Don’t molly coddle her,” James said. “We haven’t got the money. The train alone is nearly two hundred pounds return and we’ve got too many outgoings as it is.”



She huffed, wishing she’d never asked as she pushed the last bit of toast into her mouth.



As Tara tidied away her plate, Mum said, “We promise. August. At least then it’ll be the school holidays.”



She said through a full mouth, “Yeah, then the tickets go up to three hundred. It’s fine. Don’t worry about it. I’ll just stay home.”



James shook his head as if disappointed, but a beeping sounded and everyone instinctively checked their phones.



“It’s mine,” Tara said, opening her texts as she pulled her schoolbag from beside the front door to the kitchen island. “Just school.”



“Why is school texting you?” Mum asked, as if it sounded suspicious.



“Reminder for maths revision at eight thirty, that’s all.”



James shot a look at the clock. “It’s quarter passed now!”



“Chill! It’s revision. They don’t even call the register for those,” she scoffed, but he snatched his keys from the counter near the front door and said, “Bag, coat, now! Mum, tell her!”



When Tara turned to them both, expecting to get some back up at his domineering attitude, Dad simply lost himself in his cup of coffee whilst Mum crossed her arms as if unimpressed.



“Revision’s important!” Mum finally said.



Tara threw her hands in the air. “They’re *mock* exams!”



The chilly morning wind rushed in after James swung open the front door. “In the car, now. I’ll go to work early if it means getting your privileged backside to school.”



She was almost about to argue. *Privileged*? When she can’t even afford a birthday trip to Brighton, of all places?



She controlled her outburst with some mindful breathing and grabbed her coat. “Suppose I’ll see you guys tonight, then.”



Mum called, “I’ll be home around six! Momo’s with the sitter until then. Have a lovely day! Study hard!”



Mum continued even after the door was closed and they were both standing in the sunny London street of terraced houses, packed with cars and alive with bird song and airplane rumbles. James’ car was just outside, green and shiny, second hand but in good nick, with race car stripes and ergonomic seat covers. He had the engine going before she’d even sat down, and away they went by the time she buckled up.



“Honestly, you need to get a better grip of things,” he said as he checked his mirrors and signalled to leave the end of their street, joining a busy road of cars, busses, and far too many cyclists. She ignored him as she scrolled on her phone. Not like that shut him up.



“Mum’s working day and night at the office and at home to get this new partnership. Dad’s working seven days a week just to keep the practice running. I can’t even move out since I’m paying into the mortgage as well!”



“Mum’s splitting the equity with you, though. It’s not a sacrifice.”



He smiled as if he could snap, but was restrained as he said, “You have no idea what you’re talking about. Don’t just repeat random bits that you hear through closed doors.”



“Or what?” she asked nonchalantly, looking at him. As they came to a stop at the lights, he made sure to look down at her. She held his stare until she couldn’t anymore and stuck her tongue out instead.



“Nice,” he said sarcastically as they pulled away. “Real mature.”



She pulled open her bag and rummaged around inside, but made sure to say with some attitude, “I’m not allowed to wear makeup but I’m supposed to act mature?”



“Acting mature is how you learn to *be* mature. Plus, you end up looking like a clown.”



“Oh shoot, I left my keys…”



He slapped the steering wheel. “None of us are home until late, Tara!”



She shrugged. “I’ll hang at Jads.”



“You will not! He’s a full-grown man!”



“He’s seventeen and lives with his grandma…”



He almost lost control of the car as he fiddled with the keys still in the ignition. Eventually, he freed something and threw it at her. A house key. “Don’t lose it.”



“You know, maybe life would be a bit better if you weren’t such a goon.”



“For who? You?” he asked as he pulled up outside her school, a large white building of four wings and a glass dome, new and shiny with loads of students pilling through the towering metal gates of the parking lot. “Why don’t you actually study for once instead of spending all your free time busking like a hobo in the park with your stupid friends. You know, actually give us a reason to be proud, Tara!”



“The hell? We’re not *busking*!” she snapped as she threw the door open. “No lie, you’re a bit of a prick.”



“Don’t give me that! I saw your report. You’ve flunked nearly every lesson. What’s Mum going to say when she finds out next month when the results go live online?”



“Well,” she said as she slipped out. “You can just tell her on my birthday. Then at least one of us can have a surprise,” she said before poking her tongue out once more and closing the door. He continued to purse his lips as he watched her head towards school, though the traffic around him forced his return to the road.



She had intended to not look back but couldn’t help it as the anxiety won. She’d hidden her reaction well, but her heart was thumping knowing James had seen her report. With how sassy she’d been, she wouldn’t be surprised if he told Mum tonight about their *wayward* girl. Of all the Edingsons, she was by far the least academically successful. Even Momo at just thirteen months was advanced for his age. Tara would be lucky to scrape a C in most of her classes this year. 



She stopped in the school parking lot and pulled out her phone as kids streamed by. The text back from Jad was in all caps as he reacted to the news that her Brighton trip was over.



*‘YYYYYYYYY?’*



She replied, ‘*Mum says we don’t have the money. whatevs, I’m going, money or no money*. *Sick of being held back when hitching’s free. Get me?’*



As soon as it sent, the three dots appeared to show that he was typing.



*We can be Queeeeens on the run!*



She wanted to laugh, to love the idea of just being out on the road, no timescale, no burdens, but something loomed that made the back of her stomach feel heavy. Even when she closed the app to expose the home screen of her and Jad posing in rockstar attire – a moment that lived on as one of the best times in her life – something ominous fell over her. It didn’t help that her eyes landed on the red car parked several rows over, covered in final-notice parking tickets with large yellow clamps on the wheels.



Huffing as she forced her phone into her bag, she hurried inside.",1,1734076874.0,writers,1,1.0,False

How to stop pressuring myself?
I’m 21 years old and currently studying in university. I’ve never had any work or part-time experience. just helping my father job when free or selling coffee for my parents business. But it feel like I’m not appreciated it much because it’s not from my effort it’s from my parents effort. I feel not appreciated it much if it’s not from my own hard work effort. I’m not satisfied with the money I get from parents gave me from doing the job because it’s not from my own effort. I usually just go through my days without much thought. One day, I saw a story on social media from a friend (outside my university) about working a good-paying job while studying. yes lots of stories I saw was all about that. They’ve even done temporary work before their internship. But I haven’t done anything about this. Just spent time at uni for study party and sleep and doing the job at home. This made me feel really down about myself. Concerning in the future about finding some work because I have no experience.

I don’t usually compare myself to highly successful people, but I do compare myself to hardworking people —those who study and work at the same time or do extra jobs when free. They seems pretty cool to me that they got money from their really own effort while studying. My family is very supportive they said “Chill you will eventually work once you graduate as you desired”, but I constantly feel this pressure in my head. It’s like I can hear voices saying that people see me as someone who just relies on my parents. I feel like I can’t continue living like this and need to learn how to endure challenges and doing something for my parents at age 20.

I’ll graduate next year, but I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything. How can I start taking small steps without overwhelming myself? If there’s something wrong with my mindset, please advise should I quit the social media stuff? ",2,1734075523.0,howtonotgiveafuck,6,1.0,False

One concern I haven't resolved is the genre. It has strong aspects of a suspense or thriller, and that's its beating heart, but it's woven with a strong thread of the literary, nodding almost to Kundera. Crossover is too vague (perhaps). It's also too plot driven for it to be considered contemporary. So idk. Does upmarket work? Help here would also be appreciated.

Dear \[Agent’s Name\],

When OMON raids a small production studio in Saint Petersburg, filmmaker Artem faces a choice: flee to safety or risk everything to protect a documentary that could expose the cracks in modern Russia’s carefully maintained facade. Across the Atlantic, his estranged brother Nikita, a struggling actor in New York, receives a letter that pulls him back into a country, and a relationship, he thought he’d left behind. 

*The Weight of Forgetting* (66,500 words) is an upmarket work of literary suspense that explores identity, loyalty, and defiance in the face of authoritarian control. Through the lens of two brothers’ intertwined journeys, it explores the toll of authoritarianism, the erasure of memory, and the power of art to challenge societal decay.

In Saint Petersburg, Artem and his irreverent producer, Dasha, must navigate a world where their art has made them targets of the state. As their hard drives are confiscated and their movements watched, Artem’s conviction is tested against the growing threat to his freedom. Meanwhile, in New York, Nikita finds himself grappling with his heritage in an industry quick to reduce people to headlines. When the brothers’ lives collide, they must confront the political and personal divides that have shaped and fractured their worlds.

Blending the emotional resonance and moral complexity of Anthony Marra’s *A Constellation of Vital Phenomena* with the taut suspense and geopolitical intrigue of Olen Steinhauer’s *The Tourist*, *The Weight of Forgetting* offers a poignant exploration of resistance and remembrance in an era of repression. Its nuanced commentary on the intersection of the personal and the political will resonate with readers of character-driven fiction and socially conscious narratives.

**First 300**

The paper factory had been abandoned for decades before it found new life as a cultural hub in the Petrogradsky District, a small island just outside the center of Saint Petersburg. Now, its brick walls housed artists’ studios, dance companies, and tech startups, with a trendy cafe on the top floor serving pour=overs to creatives who paid more in rent than the building’s original workers earned in a year. Artem had always found the place ironic—a symbol of the city’s half-hearted embrace of modernity—but he liked the quiet it offered after hours, long after the cafe had closed and the startups had switched off their monitors.

He pushed open the production studio door where he worked with Dasha and dropped his backpack beside a desk cluttered with empty coffee cups and hard drives. The space smelled faintly of dust and burnt wiring. A glance at the clock told him they had less than two hours before the building’s night guard did his rounds.

“Export ready?” Dasha’s voice broke the silence, clipped and businesslike as usual. She was leaning over a monitor, her face illuminated by the blue glow of the timeline she’d been scrubbing through.

“Just finished,” Artem said, pulling out a chair. “It’s uploaded, sent, and out of my hands. Let’s hope Yandex pays us this time.”

“Good. Then let’s see the masterpiece.” Dasha gestured toward the monitors. “Red Hope, right? Still sounds like an espionage thriller to me.”

“Working title,” Artem said as he powered up the editing rig. “Lock the door, will you? I don’t want a repeat of last week.”

Dasha rolled her eyes but obeyed, throwing the deadbolt and leaning her weight against the door for good measure. “Bolted. Want me to wedge a chair under it too? Maybe build a barricade while I’m at it?""",2,1734074894.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

For context: I moved to New York City after college, I’ve been here for almost three years now, I got a degree that I don’t use and I’ve spent my first year bussing tables and walking dogs, now I managed to land a steady job working nights as a hotel receptionist.  I’m deeply depressed, I barely go out besides my job and I’m just an incredibly pessimistic and anxious person, all in all. I have felt incredibly lonely and isolated ever since coming out of college and I just couldn’t find my footing.

Anyways, two years ago I was dragged to a Halloween Party downtown. I was this shy fresh-out-of-the-suburbs kid in the corner of the room, scared to death to interact with any of these cool and hip kids. This girl (My friend) saw me and saw that I was bored out of my mind and talked to me, I was just so amazed by how she carried herself, she was and is so inventive, free-spirited, zany and incredibly beautiful. We exchanged numbers but she was so out of my league that I thought nothing of it. To my surprise, some weeks later she asked if I wanted to get coffee, we had a lot of good talks, we realized we were in similar stages of our lives (Both out of college and new to the city, she was also in and out of jobs and working in a creative area)

In the first months we began talking a lot, she told me that she had been in a long term relationship before and it had ended badly. I know she was hurt and troubled by it so I didn’t bother her much with it. She had been struggling with depression since high school and it was evident as she would disappear for weeks at a time. I began to really fall for her during these vulnerable times, I’d go visit her and make sure she was okay. She told me she didn’t do dates and was trying to work on it. I thought that was okay as it really did not bother me then as I couldn’t fathom us together.

We’ve become really close, we have shared a lot of late night calls over the years, I’ve been to her aparment countless of times, she has cooked for me, she even let me stay at her place for a couple of weeks last year because some issues I had at my place. She has helped me through some family issues I’ve had and encouraged me to pursue my writing (I had written a lot in college but had abandoned it.) and I helped her build up the courage for her to go back to art school.

We have kissed a handful of times, but have never slept together and always avoided talking about it afterwards. We manage to talk about anything about our lives, the most insignificant details but not the fucking huge elephant in the room.

It’s not all cupcakes and rainbows though, we have had a few real ugly fights, where we have said horrible things to each other.

I swear there are a lot of this moments where we both don’t say anything, we sit by her window, we don’t say much, we just look at each other and I just feel like things will be alright.

In all the time I have known her I’ve never talked about her to my close friends or family. I’ve met some of her friends at her birthday party but it really does feel like we our both separate bubbles in each other’s lives.

We are in a status quo, a complete impasse. Sometimes I feel like she’s waiting for me to ask her out whilst I’m also waiting for her to do the same. I still feel like that would be out of character for her, she’s really decisive and doesn’t like wasting time, so I feel like she would’ve said something by now.

In the past year and a half, she began to do a lot better, she loved art school and had gotten a job at a boutique she really liked, she suddenly wanted to do all these things like for me to go with her and her friends to Rhode Island. Whilst she was soaring and excelling I really began to hit a new low, I didn’t go out, didn’t take care of myself, my best friend moved away, I had gotten fired from a job and my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer. I began seeing a therapist and tried working through my depression and suicidal ideation.

She noticed and began visiting me more frequently, sometimes she brought me food, left me notes ,everything. I really began to push her away.  She expressed her frustration with me because I don’t go out of my comfort zone and my apartment. (I know she is a 100% right). I could never be the type of guy to kiss her affectionately in the street, to show that in public. I could never afford to buy her expensive dinners or go with her on holidays. I’m not the guy that’s in relationships, I’ve never been in a serious adult relationship and it’ll show. I’m still this immature manchild. I have always been insecure about our age difference given that she’s two years older than I am.

I’m incredibly proud of how she has prevailed through many ups and downs in her life but I can’t help but feeling like she keeps leveling up in her life whilst I’m going down.

She’s just so great and doing so much better in her life now, and I don’t really want to ruin that.

Despite all of this, she is always on my mind, I can’t get her out. I am in love with her.

I hate feeling like this but I just keep waiting to somehow fuck our dynamic up or for her to suddenly realize how there is no need for her to keep hanging around me and it’s kind of turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I'm not sure if I should pursue a relationship with her. I want to but I don't know if it's for the best. That’s the problem and dilemma I have been dealing with for the past months I can’t see a good outcome either way, I know that If I don’t ask her about it I’m just going to be miserable and kick myself for it and I will inevitably distance myself from her as it’ll be too hurtful to be around her. On the other hand, I know that if I tell her and let’s say she tells me she wants to have a relationship with me, we’ll have it good for a while but we will be ignoring the fact that we are both ill equipped to handle a long term relationship.

I just feel like I’ve met her at a wrong time in my life and I’m too young for it to go right, I know I have a long ways to go and I have to clean myself up before I can do anything.

She’s the best person I’ve known and even though she doesn’t like to admit it, she is fragile and sensitive, I really don’t want to ruin or complicate things for her and I feel as if my perspective on this is skewed, I need your help on whether I should bare it all out to her or hold my peace.

1hd6sx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1hd6sx4/living_in_bangkok_on_mhcol_budget/,living in bangkok on m-hcol budget,"wanted to share what kind of lifestyle a medium to high cost of living budget (let's say, US$2k to $4k per mo by international standards) affords in bangkok. 

most posts i see about bangkok are optimized towards lower budgets. that's great, and i've lived fine on less than $1k-1.5k/mo myself. but it took me a while to figure out how to best use a more flexible budget to really upgrade my day to day. hopefully this helps anyone else in a similiar situation.

## Accommodation: $700-800/mo (2x-3x that for serviced apartment option)
If you're willing to sign a 1-year lease, $700-800 is more than enough to get a 1br apartment that is 

1. within 5 min walking distance of a BTS/MRT station, 
2. higher build quality, and 
3. relatively central. 

I cannot emphasize points 1 and 2 enough. 

living very close to (ideally connected to) a BTS/MRT station will make or break your experience. Idc if you love walking around (I do too normally); you will not in Bangkok. It's the difference between being sweaty and feeling gross all the time versus feeling like an actual human being. Please, please prioritize LOCATION above all else.

as for build quality, a LOT of condos here are shit. They may look nice in the brochures and airbnb galleries, but in-person they are falling apart, infested with creatures, or worse. Good news is that not ALL condos are like that, but you will need to be choosy and pay VERY close attention to detail to find a good one. A $700-800/mo budget should be more than enough for that. 

If you're willing to live a bit farther out, rents drop dramatically. I chose to live in Ekkemai, which is plenty far away from the ratchet areas (like Asoke and Nana, where I wouldn't live even if you paid me), but still quite central. on nut and punnethewi (near true digital park) are also popular.

If you're not willing to sign a long-term lease, most hotels and serviced apartments offer special monthly rates. This should roughly correlate to 2x-3x the monthly rent of what you'd pay for a comparable condo. I'm paying ~$1,800/mo (after rewards/cc cashback net ~$1,600) right now in a building where the condo side goes for $700-800/mo.

Some might find the serviced apartment premium worth it for the month-to-month flexibility, not having to worry about utilities (which can run $200-300/mo easily with electricity), and other nice things like daily housekeeping. 

I don't recommend booking an AirBnB in Bangkok without seeing it in-person first.

i also have no interest in the ""super luxe"" mandarin oriental/four seasons/ritz serviced residence noise. after a certain point, you start paying more for nothing.

## Food: $450-800/mo

when i first came to bangkok, i had this naive illusion that i'd eat street food all the time. at first i did, with generally mid results—and one bout of the absolute worst food poisoning of my life. 

if you're planning to live here long term, do as the locals do, and eat at malls. 

the food courts at large malls are fine, and will generally give you decent quality meals at street food prices (with much lower risk of food poisoning). 

but the best value i've found are at the more popular sit-down restaurants usually located in a separate area. here, you can generally expect to pay 2-4x what the ""street food"" version of a dish would cost, but for MUCH, MUCH higher quality. and all things considered, it's still relatively cheap by international standards. 

examples:

* Thong Smith boat noodles (150-300b/$4-9 depending on options)
* Boon Tong Kee chicken rice (130b-300b $4-9 depending on how much chicken you want)

look for places that are packed, and then go during off peak hours. don't be a snob like me and dismiss a place because it's a chain. here, being a ""local"" chain is a good sign that the place is good enough to be successful. 

most of my other meals are at saladstop, getfresh, bowlito (better chipotle) and the like. the basic yuppy diet, i know. this starts at ~$6 but goes up to $10-12 for me because i load up on proteins and extras. i usually order this on grab, which frequently offers discounts to get my avg price per meal <$10, closer to $7.

then there's the random supermarket prepared food meals, which usually cost <$1-2, discounted later in the day. you can also get high quality precut fresh fruit for $1.5-$3/pack (pomelos!!!). 

i eat out all the time, without optimizing for budget, and i don't spend more than $15-20/day most days. still, i leave extra room in my budget for the times i want to eat out at a nicer restaurants (avg $30 per meal) with friends, etc.

people say western food is expensive, and yea i guess they are at fancier restaurants, but you can also get two pizza hut pizzas delivered to your door for under $10. and they're actually good, like it's the 80s or something (or how i imagine it was back then). 

## Coffee + Co-working: $120/mo

if there's one thing that surprised me, it's the price of coffee. seems like the going price for espresso at nicer cafés in central areas is 100b ($3+) which is not inexpensive. i've seen prices down to 50b, but at that level quality starts to vary. still possible to find a good cafe at that price point, just have to look.

the annoying part is that i prefer filter coffee, which tends to be more expensive because that's not really a thing here. so filter coffee usually means fancy pourover coffee, where 150-200b will give you a tiny ass cup of weak church coffee with an annoying tasting note lecture that idc about. i just want to taste caffeine!!! 

funny enough, the best ""value"" i've found is the filter coffee at starbucks reserve. this is usually pourover (with beans that are not burnt to shit), but brewed strong and served in gud amurican portion sizes. this runs ~145 baht for a tall ($4.5), which is more than i'd spend at home, but not _that_ much more given how crazy expensive everything has gotten worldwide. i hear the same pourover costs upwards $12 in SF nowadays. 

i don't pay separately for co-working, so i just roll the coffee cost into coworking spend. it works out. 

i also frequently get the packaged black coffee at 7/11 (roughly $1-1.5 per bottle), but you need to look for one that isnt packed with sugar or artificial bullshit. best i've found is UFC black, but that seems in short supply. 

you can also get the black coffee at café amazon (cheaper version of starbucks) for like 50b, but it tastes like jet fuel. good, and sometimes needed, but not for me every day lol. 

## Transport: $50/mo

tbh i don't track this closely, but seeing as how my typical BTS trip costs ~$.60 and i take it at least a few times every day, $50/mo sounds right. if your schedule allows (i imagine this applies to most of us here) avoid BTS during peak hours, which is roughly 8-10am and 5:30p-7:30p. 

what i DO NOT do is take grab. at least, i try to avoid it as much as possible. 

it's true grabs are cheap: maybe $3-9 depending on where you're going. in fact, you may be tempted to break rule #1 and say, sure i don't need to live close to public transport because i'll just grab everywhere. 

### NO!!

first, it'll take at least 15-20min for the grab to get to you, esp the cheaper options. also, do NOT underestimate bangkok traffic. fr it once took me ONE HOUR to go two BTS stops on sukhumvit, what would've taken 2min by BTS, 30min walk. 

plus, even the best-kept grabs tend to be a bit damp and dank (inevitable when running AC all the time in humid climate), and being stuck in that in traffic is NOT a good experience. but for me idc if i'm getting picked up in a bentley; sitting in traffic drives me insane. 

i only take grab to the airport (even then, i prefer the airport rail link if i don't have too much luggage) or special occasions. 

## Fitness: $500/mo

this is my splurge.

i go to virgin active, which costs $150/mo (or more accurately, every 4 weeks) for 12-week minimum contract, $100/mo for 12-mo minimum. va is generally regarded as the best (chain) gym in bangkok, but they tend to invest in things i don't really care about: sauna, classes, pool, salt room (??), and so on. in terms of pure functionality (equipment quality, platform availability), i'd say va is good, not great, and highly variable based on location.

however, va membership is worldwide, so i can use the gyms in singapore when i'm there (where the same membership would be 2x+).

i also do olympic weightlifting pt at a super well-equipped gym for roughly $50/session, 2x/week. this is the bulk of my monthly expense. it's taught by someone who has competition experience, not someone who's taken a weekend crossfit class. this would easily cost me upwards 2.5-3x back home, where i just wouldn't be able to swing it. here, i can make it work. 

also you can buy pretty good milk protein shakes for $1.5 at 7/11, grocery stores (sunshine dairy is best). idk if this is fitness or food spend but now you know.

## Other (mostly health insurance as American 🥲): $500-1000/mo

yea i'm paying about $350/mo for shitty american health insurance. i've been dragging my feet on finding an international alternative because most of the premium is tax deductible for me, but i should figure this out.

the other stuff is just misc for subscriptions, toiletries, etc. i don't really track this, just giving an idea of how much you might expect to spend.

what i don't spend much money on anymore is alcohol/going out and short trips since i've found a nice routine here in bangkok. but when i do drink, alcohol isn't nearly expensive as it used to be because the gov dropped most of the tariffs recently.

## All in: ~US$2-4k ish 

hope that gives you a good idea of how you can live in bangkok on $2-4k a month. this is obviously way above median local salaries, but more or less what you can expect to spend for a relatively modest lifestyle in most cities in the US (excluding higher-end lifestyles in vhcol areas like sf, nyc), more expensive parts of europe, and outliers in asia like singapore and hong kong.

i'd always written off bangkok as too hot, crowded, chaotic, and so on, but the thing about bangkok is that it's big enough that you CAN find exactly what you're looking for if your budget is flexible enough. for me, that was:

1. living a relatively quiet but central neighborhood,
2. where i wouldn't have to deal with traffic (so living close to public transit),
3. eat healthy meals for relatively cheap, and
4. focus on fitness.

i was pretty far into the process of relocating to singapore, but decided to give bangkok another shot on a whim since i'd gotten 5-year visa (dtv).

With clever furniture choices and decor ideas, you can make the most of your compact space while maintaining a chic, inviting aesthetic. From multipurpose designs to stylish accents like [ceramic vases](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/ceramic-beige-vase-l) and [wall decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/wall-hanging-decorations), here are the best **space-saving furniture ideas** to transform your small apartment into a cozy and organized haven.

# 1. Multifunctional Furniture: The Small Space Essential

Invest in furniture pieces that serve multiple purposes. Not only do these save space, but they also add versatility to your home.

* **Sofa Beds:** Perfect for hosting overnight guests while saving floor space during the day.
* **Ottomans with Storage:** Use them as extra seating, a coffee table, or storage for blankets and books.
* **Drop-Leaf Tables:** Ideal for dining or working; these tables can be folded down when not in use.

# 2. Compact Dining Solutions

Dining areas often feel like a luxury in small apartments, but they don't have to be. Here’s how to make it work:

* **Bar Chairs for Dubai Apartments:** Sleek and stylish [bar chairs Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools) are perfect for creating a modern dining nook. Pair them with a slim bar-height table for an intimate dining area that doesn’t overwhelm your space.
* **Foldable or Extendable Dining Tables:** These allow you to scale up for dinner parties and fold down for daily use.

# 3. Outdoor-Inspired Indoor Seating

Small apartments benefit from versatile, lightweight furniture that can be easily moved around. **Outdoor stools** are an excellent choice:

* Use [outdoor stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/adelia-bar-stool) as extra seating when entertaining guests.
* Their compact size and durability make them great for indoor use, too.
* Choose stylish designs in neutral tones or bold colors to complement your interior.

# 4. Vertical Storage and Wall Decorations

When floor space is limited, think vertically! Walls are a goldmine for storage and decor opportunities.

* **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Use them to store books, display decor, or even house plants.
* **Wall Decoration:** Add personality with framed art, mirrors to reflect light, or woven wall hangings for texture.
* **Pegboards:** These functional pieces can hold everything from kitchen tools to office supplies while doubling as a decorative element.

# 5. Stylish Storage Solutions

Maximize storage without compromising style by incorporating dual-purpose furniture:

* **Beds with Built-in Drawers:** Utilize the under-bed space for storing clothes, bedding, or seasonal items.
* **Ladders for Hanging:** Leaning ladders can hold towels, magazines, or even throw blankets in a compact, chic way.
* **Ceramic Vases with Hidden Storage:** Some modern **ceramic vases** come with compartments, offering a unique blend of decor and functionality.

# 6. Create Zones in Open Spaces

Define separate areas within your apartment without using bulky furniture or walls:

* Use rugs to mark different zones, such as a living area and workspace.
* Opt for open shelving or slim dividers that allow light to flow through while delineating spaces.
* Add **ceramic vases** or plants to visually anchor corners and create a natural separation.

# 7. Outdoor-Inspired Spaces Indoors

If you don’t have access to a balcony or patio, create an indoor “outdoor” vibe.

* Incorporate **outdoor stools** and small bistro tables for a casual, relaxed look.
* Use greenery and **ceramic vases** to bring nature inside, adding vibrancy to your space.
* Opt for light, weather-resistant furniture that can double as both indoor and outdoor seating.

# 8. Optical Illusions with Mirrors and Lighting

Mirrors and lighting can make a small apartment feel more spacious:

* Hang a large mirror opposite a window to reflect light and create the illusion of more space.
* Use pendant lights or wall-mounted fixtures to free up valuable floor and table space.

# Final Thoughts

Living in a small apartment doesn’t mean you have to compromise on design or functionality. With smart furniture choices like **bar chairs**, **outdoor stools**, and dual-purpose pieces, you can create a stylish, organized home that feels spacious. Add personality with **ceramic vases**, thoughtful **wall decoration**, and a mix of greenery to complete the look.

Dating is super mechanical if you're using dating apps, obviously. You can have chemistry with someone you meet on an app, but it's rare and different. People are mainly looking for one of two things, casual hookups/short term or a long term stable/healthy relationship. I've never been in that type of short term/casual relationship but I hear they tend to be based off of attraction. Meanwhile the 'good' people you meet for a long term relationship you just don't really feel for.

You go through dating with all these expectations and hangups and sometimes reluctance. ""Oh he's a good person and communicative and understanding etc but just don't really feel that spark"" or ""Oh I'm attracted to him but he's a toxic asshole"". Either way, it's never that emotionally deep because it's missing the other facet.

When did having both go away?

I remember my first relationship as a teen. Upon seeing him the first time, I felt this sense of comfort and peace around him WITH these gut-wrenching butterflies I almost threw up in his bathroom the first time we kissed. It was so electric and just all night. We'd handwrite each other love letters, would go into each others' jobs and drop off treats and kiss each other on shift. I would write about him in my journal every night. We would always text each other hearts and sweet nothings, I miss you's. He had a special box with reminders of me where he would save random scraps from the places we went to and photos he printed and decorated his room with paintings I made. We NEEDED to see each other every day. He'd drive hours in the middle of the night text my saying he just wants to see me for a couple minutes before he had to go, and just park outside and come kiss me and hug for like ten minutes in the driveway and it was just so intense. I'd beg him to stay a little longer. At the same time, he was a caring sweetheart, amazing young man, and I wish him well. We did break up over a dumb argument and both tried to get each other back at different points but eventually it didn't work, and I was devastated but life goes on!

It was crazy in the best way. we did crazy things, and the entire relationship was a movie-like mix of sweet innocence and absolute fire. These memories aren't tainted. I still have my old journal from that time. We wanted to tattoo each other's names on our arms. GLAD I didn't do that...

Getting that flood of excitement when you hug or hold hands. Going to the park just to lie down on the grass and cuddle and laugh. Thinking about your upcoming movie date all weekend long. Making out for hours in the back room when you pick each other up from work.

Now? Everyone is 'too busy' and doesn't really emotionally invest as much. City life moves quick. Going to a coffee shop first date is seen as boring, stereotypical, interview-like. People operate on pre-determined social rules to give the same basic answers to the same basic questions. Everyone is too focused on themselves. Dates feel the same, outings are predictable. It's just another block in the daily schedule. *""Oh yeah, we're just seeing each other right now*."" And you can stop seeing each other, having already had sex and going on several dates and it doesn't even hurt after.

What happened? Is it just getting older or is *that feeling* a thing of the past?

I hate scrolling through dating profiles and it's just photos of people throwing up gang signs, smoking, showing off shirtless photos, parties. It's so jaded. I miss pure innocent love, where you get giddy just going on a walk. Writing love letters. Is it even possible when you aren't a teen anymore?

My fiancé and I just bought a house in South Minneapolis (!), so we'll be leaving our beautiful Howe/Longfellow area apartment in mid-late January. **You will likely start your lease in Feb.** 

While we haven't told our landlords yet we're leaving (want to close on this house first!), we'll likely be on the hook for rent until end of February unless we find someone to take over the lease.

The stats:

* $1600/month; we pay all utilities (gas, electric) minus water and trash
* 2 bed +1 sunroom that's being used as an office, 1 bath (with tub), 950ish sq ft.
* Built in 1923 – great bones and lots of character!
* One car garage included, along with free washer/dryer in basement (shared with upstairs)
* Enclosed front porch, backyard (which has ample space for entertaining)
* Sadly, no pets of any kind

Alls to say – we've had such an incredible experience living here. The place is super well taken care of. New appliances, great neighborhood (walking distance to multiple coffee shops, light rail, and the river), and a very professional landlord (this is her only property).

Whether you're sprucing up a living room corner or a balcony, here are some decor ideas to help you craft a cozy nook that’s stylish and functional.

# 1. Start with a Rug to Define the Space

A well-chosen rug acts as the foundation for any cozy nook. It not only defines the area but also adds warmth and texture to the space. For small corners, a [round outdoor rug](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/textiles/rugs/round-rugs) is an excellent choice. Its compact size and shape make it perfect for tight spaces while adding a touch of sophistication.

If you’re looking to buy premium rugs, explore the wide variety of **rugs in Dubai** for options that suit every style, from bohemian patterns to minimalist designs. Choose colors and textures that complement the surrounding decor and create an inviting atmosphere.

# 2. Add Comfortable Seating

A cozy nook isn’t complete without comfortable seating. Depending on the size of your corner, consider these options:

* **Poufs:** A versatile and space-saving choice, [pouf](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/textiles/poufs) are ideal for small corners. They’re not only comfortable but also double as footrests or additional seating.
* **Armchairs:** For a larger space, a compact armchair with plush cushions can make the nook feel luxurious.
* **Floor Cushions:** For a laid-back, bohemian vibe, layer large floor cushions or bean bags.

In small corners, every piece counts. Choose decor that doubles as storage, such as:

* **Storage Poufs:** These provide hidden storage for blankets or magazines while serving as a comfy seat.

Hey everyone! I just wanted to say that I had a really great experience at Kamol Hospital in Bangkok. I'm two weeks post-op and am very happy with my results. Dr Kamol was pretty straight to the point and I didn't spend heaps of time with him, however he answered all my questions when I did have my pre-op exam with him. If you're looking for a surgeon with lots of time for you and a good bedside manner I wouldn't recommend him, but I wasn't fussed about that. The results of the surgery were all that I was really concerned about and I think he did an incredible job. My incisions are nice and straight (which is what I requested) and have healed really well so far. Can't speak too much on my nipple grafts as they're still looking pretty crusty, but so far the healing is going great.

I'd say the highlight were the staff at Kamol. The nurses were incredible and so lovely. There were hardly any communication problems (I speak 0 Thai so I was expecting it) and if we couldn't understand we'd use google translate on our phones and it did the job well. I had my mum and my sister with me, which was a complete life-saver. I would highly recommended bringing someone with you if you can -- especially when travelling. We stayed at the K Garden, which is accommodation that's owned and run by the hospital. It's about a 3 minute walk from the hospital itself. The staff there were wonderful. Lots of food and coffee places in the area as well as supermarkets/corner stores. There's even a couple pharmacies nearby if you need to get any extra supplies post-op!

Over-all, I'd say my experience was pretty much perfect. Ideally I would've stayed in New Zealand and had the surgery here, however I was looking at around 36k here in Wellington, whereas I paid about 14k including flights and accommodation.

Just wanted to share a good experience with everyone and hopefully help if anyone is looking into getting top surgery at Kamol hospital. Any questions about my experience are more than welcome!",10,1734072790.0,TransgenderNZ,4,0.92,False

1hd6mvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyphonixYT/comments/1hd6mvm/king_john_sackadorian_the_story/,King John Sackadorian the story,"In the misty highlands of the kingdom of Eldranor, where dragons soared among the clouds and magic coursed through the rivers like a living force, King John Sackadorian ruled with grandeur. Renowned for his flowing golden locks that shimmered like sunlight, he was admired by his people not only for his fair leadership but also for his unmatched beauty. The King, however, harbored a secret pride in his hair, for it had become a symbol of his rule, inspiring songs, poems, and the adoration of his kingdom.

Unbeknownst to King John, a sinister figure named Tyler—a wizard fueled by a bizarre and twisted form of magic—was envious of his fame. Tyler derived his powers not from arcane tomes or mystical artifacts but from an endless supply of coffee creamer. His cottage in the dark woods was filled with jars of the enchanted substance, each more potent than the last. While others might scoff at his unconventional source of magic, Tyler’s powers were undeniable, and his heart burned with jealousy.

Tyler schemed for months, devising a way to topple the King. He brewed a spell infused with the bitterness of his envy and the sweet, volatile essence of his creamer. The spell would prey upon King John’s greatest weakness: his ego. One moonless night, Tyler crept into the royal city, cloaked in shadows, and cast his spell. The enchantment spread through the winds, whispering to the people that King John’s hair was a divine gift that made him invincible. As the whispers grew, so did the King’s pride.

The King began to change. His speeches became less about the welfare of his kingdom and more about his own glory. His council’s advice was ignored, replaced by an obsession with his reflection and the cheers of his ever-growing fanbase. Queen Sofia, his wise and compassionate wife, watched helplessly as her beloved husband fell deeper into the wizard’s trap.

Queen Sofia was no ordinary royal. She possessed a gift of her own: a collection of magical beans imbued with the forces of good. These beans had been entrusted to her by the Great Dragon of Aethercliff, who recognized her pure heart. Each bean held a unique power, capable of countering evil in its many forms. When she learned of Tyler’s malevolent spell, she resolved to save her husband.

Meanwhile, Tyler’s plan advanced. Using the creamer’s magic, he conjured a second spell—this one more insidious. One morning, King John awoke to find his golden hair falling in tufts. Panic spread through the castle as physicians and alchemists were summoned, but none could explain the sudden affliction. Tyler’s laughter echoed from his hidden lair, for he knew the King’s ego would shatter, leaving him vulnerable to corruption.

Desperate to restore his glory, King John called upon his people for answers. It was then that Queen Sofia stepped forward, her emerald-green eyes fierce with determination. “My King,” she said, “You have been ensnared by dark magic, but there is still hope. Trust in me.” Though hesitant, the King nodded, his love for Sofia flickering beneath the weight of his pride.

Queen Sofia planted one of her magical beans in the castle’s courtyard. From it sprouted a towering beanstalk that shimmered with golden light. At its peak, a single radiant fruit hung, pulsating with a warm glow. “This fruit,” she explained, “will cleanse your soul and break the spell, but only if you climb to retrieve it yourself. You must prove that your heart is stronger than your vanity.”

Though weakened and embarrassed by his baldness, King John took up the challenge. The climb was arduous, each step forcing him to confront his flaws and the pain he had caused his kingdom. As he reached the top and plucked the glowing fruit, he felt a surge of clarity and humility wash over him. When he descended, his hair had not returned, but his heart was lighter, and his spirit renewed.

Tyler, sensing his spell breaking, unleashed his fury upon the kingdom. Dragons darkened the skies, and storms brewed over Eldranor. But Queen Sofia, wielding the remaining magical beans, called forth allies: luminous dragons of light and loyal knights who rallied behind their redeemed King. The battle was fierce, and Tyler’s coffee-creamer-fueled magic clashed with the pure energy of Sofia’s beans. In the end, the wizard’s power waned, his jars of creamer shattering as the forces of good overwhelmed him.

Tyler was banished to the desolate Wastes of Gloom, his magic sealed forever. King John, though hairless, embraced his new humility and ruled wisely alongside Queen Sofia. Together, they restored prosperity to Eldranor, proving that true strength comes not from vanity but from courage, love, and the willingness to grow.

","For the past two years, i have had a friend named John (22m) one day, he told me he liked me. We remained friends even though he still liked me. He would fluctuate between saying it’s okay to hang out and not, but that didn’t really matter because we were in the same friend group and classes. 

The beginning of this year, John started dating this girl named Maria(21F). I was incredibly happy for him and wanted to be her friend badly. I only invited him to group events as he’s part of the group, and made it clear I was very eager to invite her and to become her friend. Staying in contact with him never really mattered to me but I love meeting new girl friends.

It started small. One day a mutual friend pointed out to me that Maria was wearing a necklace identical to mine. I thought that was cool and took it as a sign we’re meant to be friends since we have a similar taste. I tried but our conversations didn’t really go anywhere. 
Then I noticed after I posted a picture in a shirt I had just gotten, she posted a picture in that same shirt. I also thought that was a coincidence because I got the shirt at a mall and I never shop there always secondhand.
So I started shopping on Depop again, and this happened about four more times. Except I’ve become weirded out by it now because this is secondhand stuff you have to SEARCH for. I found out she was going through my Depop account and finding dupes of what I’ve bought or just straight up buying what’s on my wishlist. I was weirded out so I blocked her.

Well, after this I noticed no one in the group would talk to me so I unblocked her and confronted her. I told her sorry and that it made me uncomfortable. I told her I thought it was better to remove myself from the situation because I don’t want to affect her and John’s relationship in any way. 

First, she said I really hurt her feelings and she has self image issues. Then she apologized for being weird. She never said she would stop. I have her unblocked now and invited her for coffee, but I have a weird feeling, and now I have to watch every time she copies me. This has broken up the friend group I was in and she said she wasn’t doing it with malicious intent. But a recent development is that I’m an illustrator (i literally only have 100 followers), and she decided to make an art account. Every time i post something she posts right after, the same concept in the same style. I made a picture of birds with flowers on their heads, she made birds with flowers on their heads.

My therapist said maybe it’s BPD or Autism, could it be this? 

So I guess my question is… what do I do? AITAH for blocking her? Should I meet with her for coffee? Idk 

TLDR:
This girl (21f) dating my friend (22m) who used to like me copies everything I do, including my art. She buys exact duplicates of my clothes. This made me uncomfy so I blocked her and the boyfriend, which messed up my friend group. When i found out it messed things up I unblocked her and explained it to her and she told me she has image issues and I hurt her feelings, yet she continues to mimic everything I do including my art.

F-43 and M-46, 10 year relationship, Hard situation-love him, have kids with him but need the disrespect to stop. 

Good evening, I'd really appreciate some solid advice. I've been in a relationship with my ""fiance"" for 10 years. We have two kids together, who we both adore and love immensely. 
They are young, in preschool and lower elementary. It has been amazing being a family and raising the kids together, and experiencing all of the new things our kids learn and do. 

I work day shift, and fiancé works second shift. I did quit teaching after over 15 years in, took a leap of faith, and got a different job in corporate that I really enjoy so far. I've been there a few months now. *This is important because I wanted to make a positive change in my life and come home less stressed and more able to enjoy my own kids and also to see if this would improve things with my fiancé. 

Well I feel less stressed being done with teaching responsibilities, have more focus on my family, and feel more respected in my position. 

However. My ""fiance"" and I continue to butt heads and he tells me that I can't do things that I know I can do, and other people believe I can do, just to knock me down a notch. 
Example: ""I'm going to present such and such to a company so they can incorporate this into their routine."" He quickly responded with ""You can't do that, are you kidding?"" Then laughing like the thought is ridiculous. 

We both do our fair share of work, including housework, cooking, laundry, cleaning, taking care of the kids, etc. Which I really appreciate and make sure to show that by saying thank you and compliment his efforts. 

This is not reciprocated. He just expects me to have the house clean, lunches made, any laundry he started finished and folded, blankets we used that night folded, no dishes in the sink, dishwasher emptied, everything put away, spotless by the time he comes home. 
I make sure everything is cleaned up and looking good, coffee made up for when he wakes up and for my AM commute, and pick out clothes for my daughter who has school. This is after I get home and play with the kiddos, make dinner, read them stories, snuggle them up, and put them to sleep. 

He watches our son in the mornings, which saves on daycare. He gets less sleep because of this, but can nap in the afternoon when youngest goes to pre-K which helps. 
He usually gets daughter breakfast, packed up and ready for the bus. 
He doesn't get to see her as much since school has started, but makes up for it on the weekends by doing extra things with both kids. There's even sometimes I feel left out of my own family on the weekends. 

I love being with my kids and we as parents do all of these things because we love and care for our kids. I don't complain, and tend to be a cheerful person (except when I'm on my period, is what he says and I tend to agree.) 

What I don't understand is why he has resentment towards me. 
Most recently my littlest had his mitten pulled off accidentally from his car seat and it was in my car. I thought to bring it in three times last night and I forgot. My memory isn't the best, mostly because I have a ton going on, think in my head a lot, and have memory difficulties at times. 

Anyways he texted me this am when I was on my way to work asking if I remembered to bring in littlest’ mitten. I called him and said exactly that I remembered it three times last night and then forgot and apologized. 

It was a busy night, I took oldest kiddo to CCD,(we have different religions and different political views so getting her there is my responsibility ( I get that,)and they both needed showers as well. 

Fiancé had made a delicious meal which is very very appreciated especially on a hectic night, and we all expressed appreciation by videoing a thank you from each of us during dinner. 

Both kids have a plethora of hats, gloves and mittens and youngest who had mitten missing had two other warm pairs just waiting to get used. 

Anyways, fiance was on speaker phone with kids this AM listening when I said sorry I had forgotten. He said ""I figured, I already knew the answer to that."" In a rude and egotistical tone. 

Before I left he said the same with a different subject, something trivial. Like okay you poor thing.
I’m almost to work so  I drop my stuff off at work, drive back home, deliver the mitten, and kiss and hug my youngest before I start the drive back to work. Fiancé says, why’d you come all the way back? I said I want him to have his mitten and I don’t want to be labeled (like him thinking I’m a bad mom for forgetting his mitten.) He said “that’s not the smartest.” 

So I told him I’m disappointed the way he is talking to me and to stop doing it. And it’s not okay and you are doing it in front of the kids. He mumbled something I couldn’t hear but my youngest did. 

I do have a big heart, but also stick up for myself and the underdog and admit can get a bit fiery when it comes to my family/friends or standing up for what's right.

I put “fiancé” in quotes because we got engaged right before our second child was born (that birth story and the drama with fiancé is for another time, but the greatest blessing of it all was our littlest and I focus on that.) 
A year later we got in a fight, both said some shitty things, and he asked for the ring back. 
He then went downstairs, came back up and bent it and threw it in the trash. Said that's what our relationship was, trash. 

I didn't think we would make it after that in all honesty. I went to a lawyer and gave him papers to sign for some legal documents since we own a home together and have two kids together. He stalled for almost 60 days delaying signing the papers.

During this time I'm distancing myself from him, and he said he doesn't want this, he’ll agree to go to counseling for a second time, and he really wanted us to be together and be a family. 
I said okay, ate the 2k legal fees and things have been decent overall except the occasional fight and disrespect.

I do want to say it's not been the most pleasant relationship, but I do love him very much. And I want to be together as a happy family unit. I just think he can be controlling and belittling at times. I make sure to tell him ah hell naw most days he wants to be rude.

1hd6hqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hd6hqb/update_on_the_roommate/,UPDATE ON THE ROOMMATE,"Hey everyone, after some consideration I decided to text my roommate some ground rules. It’s 15 of them. One of them is she must have a job in 30 days or we will have a conversation. I did sugar coat it but I’m pretty sure she got the idea that no job=her ass is being kicked out. I texted her at 4am and I came home to my apartment…almost spotless. The cat tree was cleaned off and both my cats were on it just being cats. She folded all the laundry and put all her stuff away. I had a coffee table again. The only thing that didn’t make sense was that my pin on my keys was missing. I have one of those land yard for my keys and I have a pin on it. That my boyfriend gave me when we started dating. So it’s very special to me. I figured it fell off and that it would turn up once I was able to deep clean the whole apartment. Well that pin ended up in the bottom of my foot. I yelled “fuck!” Over and over again. I repeat words when I’m having intense emotions. My roommate ran to me and said what happened. I said there’s something sharp on my rug. She said she couldn’t see anything. Now the bottom of my foot was bleeding, not too bad just a some pinhole in my heal. I yelled “look under the rug.” There was my pin. I asked her how it got there and she said oh the cat was playing with it. I said don’t let it happen again. 

What ticked me off was I just spend 60 dollars on food and I made us both tacos. I asked her how the food was. To make conversation. She said “ehh could be better.” I looked at her and said “well I think it great that we have a good meal. Food is food.” She shut up and was quiet the whole night. Til I got up for some ice cream and wanted a granola bar. I got what I wanted and she asked if she could have one. I said sure. I looked at the box thinking I just got these a week ago, what happened? I only had one out of the 12 that were in the box. So I thought to myself okay she ate 11 of them. I went back to sit down and put on a crime show. She kept on talking while I was trying to watch the show. So I answered her questions and she was like ewww this is so nasty. Why is it so real. I said well it’s criminal minds, what do you expect? She apparently got “scared” and was saying that if someone was at the door begging for help she would let them in. I said “no, I would not do that, you do that and you out of this apartment.” I had to explain to her that in our area that’s the number one way the criminals get into your home. There’s a lot of crime in the town i live in. There’s a man going door to door asking to borrow a phone and is basically hurting people. I’m getting a camera to put outside my front door to watch my door when I’m away. I think she’s having people over when I’m not there. I have no evidence but it’s a worry of mine.

I am able to push down the deep loneliness I feel most of the time, but alas it has bubbled up once more. I’m a 20 year old woman with 3 friends who live states away. I have no friends at college. I like my coworkers, but we are not going to “hang out”. I have nobody to really talk to. To share my day with. To give gifts and bring a coffee. I’ve never been in a relationship, and it really hasn’t bothered me but it’s starting to sting a bit. My younger brother is going on dates, all my friends are occupied with their partners. After a while it makes you think it must be you who is the problem. Will I always just be a person who has to navigate the storm alone? Will I just always be the person helping others? 

I work at an elementary school. I care so deeply for people, and the kids I care for. I make cookies and bring them to work. I make little drawings for people. I ask about their family and friends. I try to be as kind as I can. Although I admit I am a bit of a sarcastic smartass from time to time. 

It all is just too much, and yet never enough. 

I wake up 
I get a coffee 
I drive to college 
I drive to the elementary school 
I go home 
I do homework 
I play some video games, or work on my quilting project 
I go to bed 

Truly it’s sad I look forward to getting my coffee. I know all the people who work there, and I get to say hi, and ask how they are. 

Does it get better guys? Maybe it is me, maybe it’s just the path I’m meant to walk. I don’t know, I just wish I felt more connected to the world around me. 

Thanks for reading. Please let me know how you guys got out of this hole if you were ever in it. Have a nice evening peoples. ( : ",1,1734071549.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hd6afs,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1hd6afs/i_sold_my_app_for_5_and_got_called_crazyheres_why/,I sold my app for $5 and Got Called Crazy—Here’s Why It Worked 👌,"When I launched my product this week, I made a decision that turned heads—and not in a good way.

A *$5 lifetime license* for an app that could easily charge a monthly subscription? People called it reckless, unsustainable, and flat-out stupid. But here’s the thing: **it worked.**

Within **days**, I hit my 50-user cap. My inbox overflowed with feedback, and word-of-mouth spread like wildfire. That $5 price point wasn’t just a deal—it was the start of something bigger.

Now, as I’ve raised the price to **$12 lifetime for the next 50 users**, I want to break down why this bold strategy paid off, what I learned from the skeptics, and how it’s shaping the future of my app.



# 1. Speed Over Perfection

I had zero email lists, no following, and an app hot off the dev press. The $5 offer wasn’t just about affordability; it was about momentum. For the price of a coffee, I got *50 users in days*. And these weren’t just any users—they were engaged, vocal, and passionate about improving the product.

# 2. Instant Community

People who bought in at $5 became more than customers—they became **fans**. They shared feedback, reported bugs, and even became unofficial ambassadors. They had skin in the game, and it showed. Every feature improvement since launch has been shaped by them.

# 3. Word-of-Mouth Marketing FTW

When you charge $5, people talk. “Wait, you’re selling this for how much?!” Reddit, Twitter, even DMs—I watched as my users did my marketing for me. The low price created a sense of exclusivity, like they were getting in on the ground floor of something big.

If you’re curious, the app is called [Fyenance](https://fyenanceapp.com/)—a personal finance manager built to be simple, affordable, and effective. 🧘💰



# The Next Chapter: Closing the Value Gap for Next 50

After much (much much much) feedback, I capped the $5 lifetime licenses at 50 users. For the next wave of adopters, the price is **$12 lifetime**, still an absurd deal if you ask me.

The decision to raise the price reflects the app’s growing value and the incredible feedback from the first 50 users. This price is locked in for the next 50 users, after which it will increase again as the app continues to evolve.

If you’ve been on the fence, now’s the time to jump in and get involved! 🫡

# But What About the Haters?

Oh, they came out swinging.

* **“You’re devaluing your app.”** Maybe. But here’s the thing: the *value* of software isn’t just the price tag—it’s the user base, the feedback loop, and the brand trust you build. And $5 achieved all of that, *fast*.
* **“It’s unsustainable!”** Sure, $5 isn’t a long-term revenue plan. But it was never meant to be. It was an *onboarding strategy*. Now that I’ve hit my 50-user cap, I can adjust pricing with confidence, knowing the app has been battle-tested.
* **“Only freeloaders will buy!”** Wrong. My $5 users are some of the most engaged and helpful customers I’ve ever had. They care deeply about the app’s success, and their feedback has been invaluable.

# Why It Worked

Selling at $5 worked because it created a story—a reason for people to click, share, and buy. It wasn’t just a deal; it was a conversation starter. And the numbers back it up:

* 50 licenses sold in less than a week at $5
* 90% of users provided feedback
* 3 feature ideas directly from early adopters now in development

# What’s Next

Now that the $5 era is over, $12 is available for the next 50 users. It’s still a steal, and this pricing may be a rare find as the app grows. I’m also considering an upsell premium subscription for power users in the future and planning exciting updates to keep the community engaged.



For fellow SaaS founders, here’s the takeaway: **Don’t be afraid to experiment.** Pricing isn’t permanent. Sometimes you have to zig when the market zags.

If you’re on the fence about bold pricing strategies, let me know your thoughts. Would love to hear what’s worked (or not worked) for you. 🙊



**TL;DR:** Selling my app, **Fyenance**, for $5 didn’t just bring in users—it created superfans, a feedback loop, and a springboard for future growth. Now at **$12 lifetime for the next 50 users**, it’s still one of the best deals out there for personal finance management.

Handbags are the most functional accessories; they can make or break your outfit. The right bag can help you elevate your look, while the wrong bag can take away the attention from your outfit. Knowing which bag to carry and on what occasion will make you look stylish and feel included. But we know it can be daunting to segregate bags by occasion as if we needed more than sorting them by outfits. This is why we have brought you a comprehensive guide on the types of bags you should use for different occasions: 

**Office and work meetings** 

When you're looking for a bag for office and work meetings, you should find something stylish and functional at the same time. Your ideal work bag should be spacious enough to carry all your essential items, like a laptop, notebooks, water bottles, and personal items. Here are the bags you can choose from: 

**Tote bags:** a leather tote bag is a perfect selection for the office. It is spacious enough to carry all your belongings and, at the same time, looks classy. 

**Satchel bags:** Try opting for a [satchel bag](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/sienna-blossom-carver-satchel-bag) for a more structured and polished look. These can also carry your tabs and notebooks. There is a slight restriction on carrying laptops.

**Quick tip:** purchase neutral colors like black, tan, and beige. They will go with every outfit and, at the same time, give a stylish and sophisticated look.   


**Casual outings and running errands** 

For casual outings or running your errands, you require a non-heavy bag that will carry your essentials. The bag should be functional and comfortable whether you're going for a quick bite, coffee, or grocery shopping. Here are our top picks: 

Crossbody bags are perfect if you want hassle-free shopping and outings, as your hands will be empty. You can also carry essentials like a wallet, keys, phone, lip oil, and other essentials. 

Hobo bags: if your best friends are jeans and a t-shirt for running errands, we suggest hobo bags. These are ideal for carrying your essentials and, at the same time,   give you a laid-back look, perfect for casual days. 

Quick tip: Here, you can experiment with the colors; don't stick with neutral colors, as it might convert your look into a formal one. 



**Evening outings and formal meets** 

If you're dressed up for a formal night, date, or dinner, you don't need to carry a bulky bag; you need something stylish and sleek. It should complement your outfit and help you complete the look. Here are our top suggestions: 

[**Clutch bags**](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/mandala-muse-circle-crossbody)**:** This is a classic evening bag, just right for carrying your essentials like keys, cards, phone, and lipstick. Choose something with embellishments or a metallic look per your style and outfit. 

**Mini bags:** These bags are gaining popularity now, and Hollywood celebrities are wearing them on the red carpet. These are just enough to carry your cards, lipstick, and keys. 

**Quick tip:** if you want a polished look, try matching your bag with your footwear or jewelry. 



**Weekend getaways**

No one wants to carry a big trolley bag on weekend getaways. It is a big time mood killer. You need a comfortable, compact, and sturdy bag that keeps all your essentials organized. Here is what you can choose: 

**Backpack:** Weekend backpacking calls for a stylish and functional backpack. These bags help distribute the weight evenly while keeping you comfortable and your hands-free.

**Large tote bag:** this will fit all your essentials for a weekend trip. The only drawback you can face is that it will keep things unorganized, as tote bags only have a few compartments. 

**Quick tip:** Choose a zipped tote bag to protect your belongings when traveling.   


Similarly, here are the bags you can choose for the following occasions: 

**Beach days:** beach totes and woven basket bags. 

**Concerts or outdoor events:** fanny bags or small crossbody bags.

**Shopping spree:** tote bags or shoulder bags.

**Gym session:**[ duffel bags](https://www.fabricakraft.com/products/sunbrella-voyager-duffel) or backpacks. 



Every occasion demands a different bag. If you understand which one to carry, your accessories game will always be on point. You must ensure the bag looks chic and functional, making it suitable for the occasion.

To make your outdoor living room feel cohesive, use an outdoor rug to anchor the seating area. Rugs not only add comfort but also introduce patterns or colors that enhance the ambiance. Arrange your **garden furniture store** finds in a way that encourages conversation and relaxation. For example:

* Place a sectional sofa around a fire pit for cozy evenings.
* Arrange lounge chairs with a side table for a reading nook.
* Create zones with rugs to separate dining and lounging areas.

# 3. Incorporate Plush Textiles

Soft furnishings like cushions, throw pillows, and blankets are essential for making an outdoor space feel like an extension of your indoor living room. Opt for weatherproof textiles to ensure longevity. Choose colors and patterns that complement your **contemporary furniture** for a harmonious look.

# 4. Layer Lighting for Warmth

The right lighting can instantly transform your outdoor living room. Use a mix of string lights, lanterns, and solar-powered fixtures to create a warm, inviting atmosphere. Pendant lights or table lamps designed for outdoor use can add a touch of sophistication.

# 5. Add Functional Decor

Decor items can serve both practical and aesthetic purposes. Include side tables for drinks and snacks, storage benches for extra seating, and multi-functional furniture pieces to maximize usability. Stylish planters with lush greenery or vibrant flowers can also add life and texture to your outdoor living area.

# 6. Embrace Nature-Inspired Elements

To maintain the cozy vibe, incorporate elements that connect your space to its natural surroundings. Wooden furniture, stone accents, and potted plants all contribute to a serene, organic feel.

# 7. Invest in Weather Protection

To keep your outdoor living room cozy year-round, consider adding shade and protection from the elements. Options like pergolas, umbrellas, or retractable awnings shield you from harsh sun or unexpected rain, while outdoor heaters or fire pits keep the area warm on cooler nights.

Feeling ko, nami-misinterpret ang pagiging mabait ko as ""flirting"". 
Feeling ko rin nakukulitan ang iba sa mga initiatives ko for a talk, a little walk, as a safe space. 
Or baka nagpapaka-naive lang ako sa iniisip nila. 
Basta ang intention ko lagi ay makatulong lang ng konti sa anuman na paraan, and maging safe space ng mga nakakakilala sakin. 

Context:
Aminado ako, pushy talaga ako minsan, pero sa very few superclose cof ko lang. Sa mga outer cof ko, hindi ako mapilit. 

There's just this girl I met in the wrong place and at the wrong time, bagyo kasi and lahat kami evacuees. 
For a few days, nagkakilala kami, exchanged contacts, nagka-usap ng mga kababawan hanggang palalim, nagkaigihan, ang kwento niya ay BFF niya yung isang girl na kasama namin minsan sa tambayan sa evacuation center... turns out jowa na pala yun ni girl (?) Yoko mag assume ng gender identity basta parehas sila female at birth. Turns out also na malapit lang din ang lugar ng mga pinagtatrabahuhan namin at tinutuluyan. Hahaha takteng bagyo yan. Wrong place, wrong time, wrong circumstances.

Confirmed naman namin both na may 'sense of connection' daw kami sa isa't isa 😅✌️ basta yun na, may thing pero hindi pwede at wrong timing. Pero for some time now, nagcha-chat pa naman kami, i can assure na walang flirting. Humihingi lang siya ng maliliit na pabor like pa-load, and nagbabayad naman agad.

Naka ilang coffee hangout na rin kami after work. Catch up ba sa mga nangyayare samin. Naging trauma dumpster din ako for a few times. Annoyed ako ng konti pero okay lang kasi I wanna help naman.

Ito lang kasi, the week before her bday, medyo nag-iba lang ihip ng hangin. Though parehas kami busy sa work. Na bother lang ako na parang di ko siya kausap sa chat hahahaha ang cold at very short ng usap namin. Then come her bday, nag-greet ako syempre, pero 1 day after na  nagparamdam or baka may dalaw idk with female hormones haha

Assuming lang yata ako na 'close' na kami. 🤣
Parang naa-attach na rin kasi ako powtek. Haha ayaw ko lang umamin. 

Ano po ba ma-aadvice nyo sakin? 
Should I keep this person as a friend and as is na lang bahala na si batman kung saan to papunta?
Should I stop talking to her habang di pa malalim ang attachment ko sa kanya? 

Ako lang po yata ang baliw dito. ",1,1734070885.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
