1gmc1we,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheatingconfessions/comments/1gmc1we/i_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_with_one_of_my/,I cheated on my boyfriend with one of my best-friends and I am terrified of coming clean,"Throw away account as i have never posted before. Also I apologize for if it is hard to read i am a terrible writer, and have always sucked at grammar.



Background Info: I (24F) have been friends with this guy (27M) since 2022. We worked together at the same level in our jobs and after just the first few shifts we had together we became (what i believed to be) best friends. Our friendship was a lot of joking with each other, picking on each other and after being friends for a while, and spending many quiet shifts together in hospitality We began opening up to each other and sharing deep details of our past and present. Opening up to people comes very naturally to me, as i have always been a bit of an open book and never kept stuff to myself. However it was always clear that he was a very closed off person and didn't open up to just anyone. I had never known a guy to be this open this with me, as i had never had close male friends, due to only working in a female dominated industry previously.

We grew closer for a while to the point we had talked about how much we loved and appreciated our relationship, and how, having a friendship as deep and honest as ours, was new to the both of us. 

Overtime we saw each other less, due to rising through the ranks at work, and work itself getting more stressful for the both of us... and the closeness we sharded and valued had sank. I don't believe it ever really left our friendship but things just weren't the same. We both got into relationships and the closeness stopped. We would still poke fun at each other and bicker, but stopped opening up to one another. 

After a few months of stress, my friend had hit a breaking point, at work, and handed in his notice. Before he was due to leave he asked to talk to me. He wanted to open up to me, one last time before he left, as it would have been our last shift together. 

He admitted that he had had feelings for me, but never said anything because of how much I meant to him as a friend. I told him that i had always suspected, but i never brought it up out of anxiety of being wrong and also knowing that realistically we were too different of people, and have always known that we wanted different things in life, so it wouldn't have worked anyway. This was not what i wanted to say though. I didn't just suspect he had feelings for me i knew he did and i did too. I just wanted to tell him, how much love i had for him and how much i loved our relationship, and for most of it, i wondered what it would be like if we did end up together. Instead i chose to bite my tongue as he was in a relationship and seemed happy and i was (and still am) in a relationship of my own with a man, i can genuinely see spending the rest of my life with. 

But about a day or so before he was due to leave, he retracted his resignation and ended up staying. I was very excited. I thought i was going to get to keep my friend in my life, but he ended up becoming colder to me overtime. It sucked

Around this time i was hitting a breaking point of my own, rather than leaving immediately i stepped down from my role to reduce my stress, while i looked for another job closer to my boyfriends city, and eventually i did leave. I had attempted to do the same goodbye but unfortunately never really got the chance. The final opportunity came when i visited to drop off my uniform and say goodbye to other friends i had missed.  However when i finally caught him and asked if we could sit down and talk, so i could say a proper goodbye, he blew me off, claiming he was busy. I think he knew what i was going to say but i was too hurt to care. I didn't even get a lousy generic goodbye.

 We saw each other here and there over the years and it was always cold, on both sides. I didn't end up staying at the job in my boyfriends city so took a job, in a pub, not far away from where we used to work. He also finally left, months later. 

Fast Forward to now: Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year and a half. He is my absolute world and we have a beautiful and strong relationship. My boyfriend has always known past with this guy, as i never saw a point in hiding it, and we have always told each other everything, from day one. 



A few days ago, a mutual friend from our old work, who had been living in her home country for the last 7 months, came back into town. During her visit she has been starting to make plans to move back into the country, this includes finding a 3 bed house, with the guy.

I started my day having coffee with her and catching up. We then moved locations to the pub i work at, as she was meeting a group of people from our old job (I was unaware of this and thought we had just moved locations to wrap up our day). Before I had realized what was happening in walks the friend. We sat awkwardly making polite convocation while several others arrived. The next thing i knew, out of no where, WE WERE BACK! we were bickering, and joking around. It was like no time had past, he then told me to drink up because i was joining them for the evening. We spent time catching up on our lives. I told him i am still with my boyfriend, i didn't ask much of his relationships as i had heard bits and pieces through our mutual friends and i knew he had been through a lot of pain over the past year (something he wouldn't want to talk about in a group). 

As we got drunker we spent most of our convocations talking about how much we missed each other and how much love ( Platonic love ) we still had for each other and how we wanted to start spending time together again. Then before our mutual friend left we started talking about the house they were going to rent, and how they needed someone for the third room, and as i am living like a bit of a nomad between several places at the moment ( none of which are a practical long term solution for me ) I asked how they would feel about me joining them and they both agreed with enthusiasm. 

This is when i fucked up. When our mutual friend left, we moved on to a club. We were both very drunk at this point, but my friend insisted he wanted to dance. So we went with several others from the group still with us. We got to the club and both tried to encourage the rest of the group to join us on the dance floor, but as the club was basically empty they didn't want to, but we didn't care, so we went to dance just the two of us. After a while it started filling up and we were joined by the rest of the group. As i didn't know the rest of the group, too well, and I'm not great at dancing and having fun in big crowds, i kept migrating out of the small dance circle they had created. My friend noticed this and called me over to the crowded bar we looked at each other and had yet another on of our "" Holy shit I've missed you"" moments, (that we had been having all night) and both went in for yet another big hug. This is when the energy between us shifted and we started kissing. It didn't take long for me to realize ""What the fuck am i doing"" It was like, I wasn't me in that moment, or at least i wasn't current me. Its like I was me from 2 years ago kissing the guy I'd had a crush on for months.  I snapped out of it, hugged him again and then ran to the bathrooms. I felt like i was going to be sick and/or wanted to cry.

After about 10 minutes i came out of the bathroom, to find out he had left. This is when my panic for what had just happened, turned into panic for him. I called him countless times, to no response, i left the club to try and find him but came up empty. I called him and looked for him for over 45 minutes ( This may seem excessive, but he's not the most reliable drunk, so i had cause for concern, especially after what had just happened ) before giving up and trying to accept he is a grown man and can get himself home, i messaged him an apology and a plea for him to let me know he got home safe, and then went home myself.

Conclusion: It has been a few days since this happened, and from what our mutual friend has told me, this has become headline news between the rest of the group that was there that night, spilling out into our mutual friend circle. From our, soon to be roommate, so far i have learned that i am pretty confident my friend doesn't even remember what happened ( which to be honest isn't the least bit surprising, as he has always had a terrible memory even when sober ). I know i need to tell my boyfriend and am praying to every deity that he can forgive me. I have spoken to him over facetime and told him all about the night minus the kiss. I am going to tell him but i know i can't do it over the phone, and due to us living over an hour away i can't see him until Tuesday at the earliest. As for the friend, I still plan on moving in with him and our mutual friend in January as it is more about logistics for all of us. All three of us will be meeting up tomorrow. So may be updating this post after that and hopefully again with good news after telling my boyfriend. 

Is there any advice on what i should say? Is what I've done as horrible as it feels? I know I can dramatize my life into my our psychosis of shame, and i know its not like we slept together and was just a drunken kiss, but because of the history, it feels a lot worse. Especially when i cannot get that kiss out of my head.

1gmbxnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/strange/comments/1gmbxnu/eerie_staring_children/,"Eerie, staring children","I wouldn't have made this post if it was a one time occurrence. It was odd enough the first time, but a second time too? I'm 20 now and both these experiences occurred over 5 years ago. 

For the first one I was at the airport with my mom and she had left me with the bags to go get coffee. I was scrolling through my phone and happened to look up to see a boy my age or younger staring at me. Instantly I had this feeling of dread, like I was in danger. Sure it could've just been because being stared at is not the most pleasant experience, but his stare felt truly soulless and creepy. It legit made me wanna pick my bags up and run which I had never felt before. Later on the plane I dropped something and when I raised my head after picking it up, I happened to gaze through the gap between the window and the window seat and he was right in front of my seat, with the same stare. Reached destination, was getting luggage and I saw him, all normal, no weird energy this time. But something in the way he stared as.. if there was no soul behind those eyes, I still remember it vividly.

Second experience was much shorter and less disturbing, but still odd nonetheless. My parents and I were traveling in Pattaya, and we were on a tuk-tuk I think it was called? It's a little truck that's open at the back, and has 2 long parallel seats. My family and I sit on one of it and opposite to us is another family. Right in front of me is this girl around my age who looked normal, except right from the beginning she was staring at me. The same stare, and it  gave me the same feeling of overwhelming danger and dread.

Both these times it was as if I progressively got more zoned out from the outside world and locked into their gazes, unable to look away. Both the times I had the most dreadful feeling engulf me.

A central concern is the idea that the democrats have largely abandoned young white men. And that this follows a larger cultural trend that  has dismissed young white men’s struggles and denigrates their successes. 

And, for me, an old white man, I’m trying to understand what has changed from when I was 18 in 1988. I definitely struggled, because I was an idiot. I suffered because I was foolish. I was broke because I couldn’t set goals and work towards them. My friends all seemed to be struggling like me, and then we matured and got our shit together more or less. 


At no point in my 20’s did I ever think about my plight as being anyone’s issue except mine. I never felt like I was culturally or politically disenfranchised. Honestly, I never thought about anything like that. I woke up and thought about coffee, sex, music, and beer. I voted democrat because it always seemed like the lesser of two evils. I voted for abortion rights because I knew women who needed that care. I voted for gay rights because I had gay friends. 
And that’s about as deep as it got for me. 

I never thought that I was being hurt by policies or cultural trends that gave opportunities to minorities and women. I was always interested in feminism and LGBTQ rights. I believed that affirmative action was needed to correct years of institutional racism. And I  was making shit money landscaping and living with two roommates in a rental house. I didn’t see rights or opportunities extended to others, as a loss for me. And I still don’t. 

So why do so many young  white men now, seem so injured by these same policies? There is no reason  that a young white man can’t go to college, or have a girl friend, or find good work. It’s hard. It was hard for me. But is it that much harder now? I just worked my ass off and things worked out. I just don’t understand how that’s any different for my demographic now. My demographic: blue collar white guy, high school drop out, blessed with some profound learning disabilities and a few compensatory skills.

**Found out my wife is cheating with my friend**

&#x200B;

Hi, I am the OP who posted this story a few weeks ago. You guys helped me so much during a really rough time, so I felt compelled to return and share what’s been happening with you guys. I had to create a new account to do so, as I no longer have access to my previous one. Update summary: I found a heck of a lawyer, divorce papers were drafted and I filed yesterday morning, and I told the OBS.

Before I get into the updates, here is the original post (scroll to Update 5 if you’re familiar with the story and want to read the most recent update):

My wife (30F) and I (32M) just returned from a long weekend camping trip with two other couples, friends we’ve known for years. We had a great time, but something happened the morning we left that I can’t shake.

We were all packing up, getting ready to head back home. I was loading our car, when I looked up and saw my wife and my friend. There were at the campsite, several feet away. She was bent over to pick something up, and in that split second, I saw him reach out and squeeze her hip, sliding his hand down to her ass. My wife quickly pushed his hand away, but she didn’t look upset. She was smiling at him - almost playfully(?) It all happened so fast, maybe a second or two, but it felt like I’d been punched in the stomach. I glanced around, but no one else seemed to have seen it. His wife was busy packing up their car, and the other couple was further away, chatting about the ride back.

The drive home was quiet. My wife tried making conversation, but I couldn’t focus. My mind kept replaying that scene over and over. When she asked why I was so quiet, I lied and said I was just thinking about work. The truth is, I was in shock. I didn’t want to bring it up. If I mentioned it, she might tell me I was imagining things, that I was being ridiculous. The rest of the day I felt like I was just moving on autopilot. I barely slept last night and can hardly focus at work today. My mind keeps racing, questioning every detail. Aside from what I saw, the rest of the trip was great and nothing seemed out of place. A part of me is wondering if read the whole situation wrong. But, the look on her face, that smile—it was too friendly, too casual for something that crossed a line like that.

I love my wife to death. We’ve been together since freshman year of college, and I’ve never had reason to doubt her. She’s my best friend. But now, for the first time, there’s this knot in my gut that I can’t untangle. I’ve never been the type to snoop. I’ve always trusted her completely. But right now, I’m sitting here, wondering if I should check her phone. It's password protected, so even if I wanted to, I don’t know how I’d do it without her finding out. This is eating me up and I know I need to do something about it.

WIBTAH to go through her phone? And even if I wanted to, how can I if it is password protected?

&#x200B;

**UPDATE**

&#x200B;

Found her iPAD - it didn’t have a password, so I got in and it is still connected to her phone. She has Telegram on it. They’ve been chatting on there. I am still going through the messages, but she is cheating. I am not falling apart yet, I’m trying to keep it together to make the correct next move without fucking this up. What do I do? Do I confront her when she gets home? Do I go to his house and confront him? Please help.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 2**

&#x200B;

Thank you all for your advice. I didn't tell her anything. I have locked myself up in my home office under the pretence of needing to catch up on work. She is not suspicious. I kept the IPad with me, she hasn't used in so long she won't even know it's missing. I took pictures of all their messages using my phone as a safety measure as well. They have been chatting for at last 8 months as far as I can tell. Telegram is their main communication channel it seems. They've sent each other nudes, sex messages, and making plans on making their relationship official after leaving me and his wife. I can't believe she would do this to me. From the messages, I saw she had sent him a sexy suggestive photo of herself on her way to the gym earlier this evening, and when she got back home, she started kissing me, wanting sex. I declined saying I needed to get work done.

I am confused right now and unable to think clearly, so I will follow the advice I am offered here: lawyer, gather evidence. I will work on those. I also saw several comments advising me to separate my finances from hers. We co-own the apartment we live in, and have joint bank accounts. My parents died in a car crash 2 years ago and left me a large inheritance, which she knows about. She does not have access to the money in that fund, is there anything I need to do to protect myself there if it comes to that point?

We don't have kids yet.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 3**

&#x200B;

I work from home sometimes and didn’t have any meetings this morning, so I spent it researching and calling lawyers. I have two consultations lined up for tomorrow, but the majority couldn’t book me in until next week.

I will tell his wife and show her proof as soon as I settle on a lawyer and get myself covered first. Once she’s been informed, I will give her time to get her affairs in order and secure a lawyer if that’s what she wants to do before I decide what to do next, such as confronting my wife.

I don’t understand how I’m feeling. I am not angry for some reason. More numb maybe. Sick and nauseous when I think of the messages I’ve read, especially the sex messages. I just feel like I am just doing the things that I need to be doing right now, but it’s almost like I am living somebody else’s life. I don’t know how long I can keep up the poker face without her noticing something is up.

Thanks for your messages and support.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 4**

&#x200B;

Guys, I am humbled by all the messages and advice I received. Not much has happened since yesterday. Just keeping myself busy with work and the gym. The anniversary of my parents passing is coming up in about a month and she obviously knows this so when she asked why I seemed off, I just told her I was thinking about them. I have consultations with several lawyers lined up - most next week, a few this afternoon. I will update after I settle on a lawyer and know what my options are.

&#x200B;

**UPDATE 5**

&#x200B;

I found a hell of a lawyer who managed to draft my divorce papers within days, which were filed this morning. I am in a no-fault jurisdiction, which meant all the evidence of the infidelity which I had gathered, can’t be used in court. The good news is that my inheritance is safe because I didn’t use the money for marital expenses. Our condo was a wedding gift, bought by both our parents (each side contributed 50% to the down payment) so one of us will have to buy the other out or we both sell it.

I called the OBS on Saturday and asked to meet her for coffee. I chose that day because, ironically, her husband and my wife had gone on an overnight trip together. I found out from their messages on the iPad. The lies they were going with were: my wife was staying at her sister’s for the weekend to help with the kids while her sister’s husband was away on a business trip and her husband was going away for a work-related project. The truth was, my wife and my husband were taking a trip out of town together and were staying at a hotel, all paid for by the Casanova himself. I showed her their messages on the Telegram app, pictures included, all of it. She told me she noticed him feeling distant and withdrawn a few months ago, she thought it was just work stress and had no reason to suspect he was cheating. Finding out that her husband was in fact cheating, and with my wife, who is also HER friend, came as a blow to her. We chatted some more and I gave her my lawyer’s number as she considers her options.

Sunday night, my wife returned from her “sister’s house”. She walked through the door and greeted me with kisses, saying she missed me.. after she had spent the weekend with her lover. Her ability to compartmentalize is almost diabolical. I sat her down and told her we needed to talk. I had the whole conversation recorded without her knowledge (following lawyer’s advice, I live in a one-party consent state). Here’s how it went:

I asked her to promise to be honest with me (“of course, baby” but she was nervous). Then I asked her a series of questions, do you love me? (“Yes”), are you happy with me? (“Yes, of course, baby”), have I been a good husband to you? Do I treat you right? (“Yes and yes. Wth is going on?”). Please humour me (“okay”). Have I ever done anything to hurt you, whether physically or emotionally? (“No, of course not. Wtf”), Okay.. so, if you’re happy with me, then why are you cheating on me? She stared at me in shock for a good minute and then immediately started denying it. This went on for a little while and then I just told her to drop the act because I found out the truth. Eventually, she broke down and admitted to kissing a guy who had been hitting on her at a bar during a night out with her girlfriend a few months ago. I don’t know why but at this point I started laughing because the whole thing was just absurd. She not only cheated on me, she had taken every opportunity she could find to cheat on me. I asked her if that was the only time she cheated. She swore up and down that it was the only time and that it was a moment of weakness, that she was drunk, and it had meant nothing.

I said nothing, I gave her my lawyer’s business card and said I filed for divorce (I hadn’t yet, I wanted to talk to her just once first to see if there was anything left of our marriage to salvage) and that if she wanted to reach me she should call my lawyer. She cried, begged, apologised and then when I started packing a suitcase, she shifted to gaslighting me, saying I was throwing away everything we had over a mistake. And the worst part of what she said was I had no one else in the world, why would I leave the only family I had left. This stung because I told her she was my only remaining family after my parents died and there was no one else I could depend on. Only for her to throw those very words back in my face. I left that night to a hotel where I am staying until I find a new apartment. Yesterday, I officially filed for divorce.

Edit: my responses to some of the comments:

I didn’t tell her that I knew about the affair after she said she kissed some random guy at the bar. She ended up finding out from her. The OBS confronted him and called her up as well and gave her shit. The OBS was really upset when I told her and couldn’t keep it in. I don’t blame her. He really did her dirty. Her mom is sick and she has been going out of town a lot to be with her and instead of supporting her, he had been using that time to get with my wife.

I didn’t because I was blindsided by her telling me she kissed a random guy at a bar. It may sound insignificant compared to the double life she has been leading with my friend, but in that moment I think I started realizing how badly she wanted to cheat on me and it came as a shock. I was too angry to say anything to her without blowing up in her face. So, I just left. It’s hard to explain, why. It just made more sense to leave than to try and find out why she’d been sleeping with my friend after I heard that from her.

When I left the house she kept calling me that night and leaving me messages. When the OBS called her the next day and also confronted her husband, she stopped trying to reach me. It’s been crickets from her since. And him too. I put two and two together because around the time OBS messaged to tell me she confronted him and called her, I stopped getting calls from my wife.

Edit: Thank you all for the support and messages.

**Update - 9 days later**

&#x200B;

Some updates from the last time I posted.  My wife was served the divorce papers last week. I am still at the hotel and close to finding a new apartment.

Last week when I left I forgot to take iPad with me. I picked it up when I went back a couple days later to grab clothes and other stuff.

Apparently, my wife had a fallout with her friend who was with her at the bar, accusing her of being the one who told me about her kiss that “hot guy”. Her friend is no longer speaking with her it seems.

After everything went down, his wife threw him out, and he’s been staying at his sister’s place. She and I have been talking, she found a lawyer and is filing for divorce. She has informed our few common friends about what’s been going on and they’ve all cut off contact with them.

Also, the asshole came by MY place and spent the night with my wife TWICE last week.

She has also been messaging her sister, who, it turns out, knew about the affair. My wife found a lawyer apparently and was complaining to her sister that her lawyer explained the asset division and confirmed she has no claim on my inheritance and that she thought that was “unfair”.

Now, here’s the gut punch..

All those conversations about finding an apartment together and becoming official have significantly cooled since my wife’s visit to her lawyer which I found odd. A few days ago I got a message from her asking if we could put a pause on the divorce proceedings. She said she loves me, thinks we’re being crazy about this, and that everyone deserves a second chance. She even hit me with I can’t live without you BS. If I didn’t have the iPad, I might have thought she was genuinely remorseful. But knowing what she’s been up to all week, I knew this only came after she realized she won’t be entitled to a cent of my inheritance. Honestly, that fucking hurt. I am following my lawyer’s advice, who told me not to respond.

The more I think about it, the more disgusted I am by her, my friend and her sister. The fact that her “change of heart” seems to stem entirely from her discovery that she won’t touch my inheritance is beyond disturbing. I always intended to use that money for a trust fund if we had kids, something I told her countless times. I didn’t touch it because it reminded me of the trauma of losing my parents. The level of disrespect she has shown not only me, but also now my parents, who loved her and treated her like a daughter.. I’m just glad they’re not here to see this.

I met up with his wife over the weekend, she’s my friend too, and she’s been going through a rough time, especially with her mom’s health issues on top of this whole mess. I told her about the messages. Long story short, she had been reconsidering the divorce after her husband tried to reconcile with her. But once I showed her the messages about my inheritance and pointed out how their messages have cooled, she saw things differently. She also shared something that struck me. Apparently, a few months after my parents passed, her husband had made a comment about how I was a “lucky son of a bitch” for inheriting their money. She confronted him then, shocked he would call me “lucky” after losing them, and he backtracked, claiming he didn’t mean it that way. At the time, she brushed it off, but now she is second guessing his motives. It seems far fetched, but it’s starting to sound like she thought she would get her sum after divorcing me and start a new life with him? Either way, their behaviour is despicable.

I have been trying to look after myself. I started therapy, I’ve been going to the gym almost obsessively, and trying to stay away from alcohol. I am trying so hard to put on a strong exterior, some of my friends have said it’s a little scary how “cold” I’ve been, but it’s the only way I can go about my day to day without losing my mind. The nights are very rough, I struggle with sleep, I sometimes drink to help me through it - I’m not proud, and sometimes, I cry myself to sleep.

Edit: I won’t be posting any further updates in the near future (unless something unexpected happens or in need of support which I would use a different sub for). I will only post another update once the divorce has been finalised, which won’t be for months. Thank you all for the advice and support.

*He might have gone after your wife only because of the money, too. I find it suspicious that your wife learns she can't touch the inheritance and now AP is wanting to reconcile with his wife. 🤔 Could be unrelated though...*

>OOP: I don’t know if that’s why they started the affair, but his wife and I both think that’s why he came crawling back to her. And the same reason she won’t reconcile with him.

**Accomplished\_Mud1658**

*OP, make an emergency testament in cause you passed away or if someone tries to do something. ""Oh, but she would never..."" Man, I worked at court. I'm very cynical. I saw a lot of spouses like you getting shot after lottery and inheritance.*

>OOP: Thanks for your comment.

>My lawyer handled all that when I showed them the messages. I can’t speak to the details, but my bases are covered.

**letMeHearYouSayMoo**

*Hello kind stranger.*

*I haven't gone through such stuff myself. I've just gone through breakups and this is a whole different ballgame. So my advice or whatever this is probably something to be taken with a pinch of salt.*

*Please be kind to yourself. Anyone else will be the same or worse. You've been kind to yourself all this while. There's nothing but time to heal this. You're already doing gym and started therapy, you're doing good. You'll change and are changing as a person. Be there for yourself, be kind. You would look for questions, how won't you? They aren't gonna be answered. There's no closure but their actions. Constantly meet your friends and family even if you aren't physically present there.*

*The last para. How won't you go through such stuff? It's so human. You got this.*

*There's one thing I would say, if you haven't shown the source of the messages to the asshole's wife. Don't. This is a very emotional thing she and you are going through. Since the divorce isn't finalised yet, this could be a backdoor for you to know what they're planning. Even unknowingly she or you might spill out where you get this much information, which is very crucial I figure? I'm unsure if this breaches certain legal areas, so consult someone who knows what's up.*

*Take care.*

>OOP: Hi,  
>  
>Thank you for your message. I’ve told his wife about the iPad - I had to when I told her how I found out about them. Anyways, she’s been good at keeping quiet about it as we both could benefit from knowing what they are up to.

I actually really liked my job, and my co workers. But fuck this for real. 

Number one, my coworkers would make plans in front of me. Like going to target, or getting dinner after work and I’d be standing there like: 🧍‍♀️

My manager pulled me aside and asked to talk with me, mainly wanting to discuss how I “watched” a football game on the work computer. I CHECKED THE SCORE WHEN A CUSTOMER ASKED ME TO LOOK IT UP.

I was sat down by my manager in the break room being “reminded” about these policies too. 

Such as: 
- no drinks behind the counter. 
- no phones on your person. 
- no breaks on a 7 hour shift.

Mind you: I had left my phone in my pocket because I figured being a store lead I was trusted to not sit on my phone, WHICH I NEVER  DID. I was great with customers, I’m an extrovert, and I love to work. 

I also happen to be addicted to coffee. Sue me hoe. I’m putting my ice coffee behind the counter to sip. 

I would have a snack in the back on my 7 hour shift days. Five minutes to eat a fucking granola bar. 

They also told me that I would be “written up” for violating any of these things. Also, frequently left passive aggressive messages through our messaging app clearly directed at me. Little things like “leaving trash bags connected in the bins” or “squeezing out the kitchen sponge after use”. 

Honestly, suck my left tit. What the actual fuck. 

I’m a college student with three years of management experience in retail. I managed two stores back in my hometown during the summers. 

I took my break, walked out and sent an email saying: “You can mail by check to _____”

I am a little hazy on what Star Port rating (I went for B) to have this attached too and also the tech and law levels.

I think the TL might be 11 and the law level on the world is maybe 3 but a 1 in the Startown where the local government doesn't want to acknowledge it even exists so it's pretty unregulated. Breathable atmo and near earth gravity. I haven't set it on any particular world but I think it might be off the standard trade routes.

Lastly thanks for all the great feedback and suggestions I got from my last post about what types of buildings to include, so many great ideas were listed there.

(68) Observation Platform

*Setting:*

  
  
Startown Delta  
The Startown and its Class-B downport are nestled within a vastly wide canyon filled with an alien jungle. The canyon is one of many that snake their way across entire continental regions on the planets surface. At their widest points they have towns or even cities built within them and each canyon eventually ""drains"" out into ocean sized salt flats.

Jungle Fog  
No water river runs through the canyon instead, every morning and evening a dense moisture ladened fog to rolls out through the caves in the canyon walls which are linked to a huge underground network of water filled caverns.

Above the canyons  
Imposing walls that climb hundreds of meters high shield the lush canyon foliage from a desolate, yellow desert above that stretches out across the majority of the planet. The salt-covered dunes above make a crunching sound underfoot due to the mineral crust.

EM Sand Storms  
The local star often produces flares that create huge rolling sand storms across the surface off the planet. The combination of the charged winds and the mineral salts in the sand cause impressive amounts of lighting within the sandstorms themselves. The result is large amounts of interference in the electromagnetic spectrum that cuts of local communications and heavily effects other electronic systems. Specially hardened shuttles and other flying craft exist but even with those its better to avoid the storms all together.

Automated Mining Facilities  
Hundreds of facilities across the desert are all owned  by a single corporation that has been given exclusive rights (once held by locals) to extract a local and expensive earth mineral called Exxonite. Due to a law that forbids all foreigners from mining the deserts, these facilities all had to be made fully automated. Even people doing repairs on the mining equipment are forbidden to touch the surface, instead having to circle above the facilities and direct humanoid robots to do the work instead.  
Repairs are numerous due to raids from local criminals and from the frequent sand storms.

Local Crime Lord  
Organised crime within the Startown Delta is controlled by an crime who take a cut of all illicit activities but is mostly hands off, using the Startown mostly for controlling smuggling in and out of the downport. It's also rumoured that he is in charge of the raids that take place on the Automated mining facilities, in fact many of the humanoid robots that get stolen from those facilitates look a lot like the ones that are used all over the place in Startown Delta.

  
  
*Local Customs:*

  
  
Salt Walkers  
Some traditional tribes still travel the deserts using the old ways, keeping the old traditions alive by moving from canyon to canyon on foot.

Salt Cubes  
One tradition still in use by people in Startown Delta that are descendants of salt walker tribes is the presence of a salt cube at family meals. Once given to ""preserve bonds"" with family and friends, its now purely ornamental and sits in a dish on the table next to the cutlery.

Mountain Clan  
A stoic people that even in modern times now (the clans have all disbanded) continue the habit of not speaking or ""breaking the peace"" of the morning until they have consumed food or drink.

Dont Look Into A Storm  
Salt Clan descendants still wont look up when a sand storm is over head, especially girls. They protect their eyes and avoid direct eye contact with lightning, once believing storms are sent to punishing arrogance, especially those who look up challengingly or yell into a storm.

Covering Eyes from trouble  
When things seem to be getting intense another custom is the gesture of putting your hand over your eyes for a moment as if to shield them from trouble. Also thought to originate with sand storms.",3,1731044770.0,traveller,0,1.0,False

My Honest Review and Results,"[Nagano Tonic Review](https://preview.redd.it/ai3j7pwk6mzd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a982c9f88b21729c2563106425e3eec0c0bf90c0)

When I stumbled across *Nagano Tonic*, I didn’t expect much. After trying countless wellness supplements that promised rapid weight loss and endless energy, it felt like I’d seen it all. But after reading up on *Nagano Tonic* and seeing its ingredient profile, I thought, “Why not give it one last shot?” What’s different about this tonic, I found, is its blend of ancient, natural ingredients that target weight management by addressing the root causes of weight gain: stress, metabolism, and even cravings.

Within the first week, I felt an unexpected surge of energy. Not the jittery, caffeinated kind, but a stable, steady stamina. I’d start my mornings with a glass of water mixed with *Nagano Tonic*, which easily became a refreshing part of my morning routine. That sense of sustained energy kept me productive throughout the day and helped me stay consistent with my goals without needing an afternoon nap or extra coffee.

By the second week, I noticed my cravings had mellowed out—a huge win for me. I didn’t have the usual urge to snack, especially on sugary treats, which had always been a struggle. This change wasn’t instant, but I realized I was naturally gravitating towards more balanced meals without forcing it. A blend of ingredients like ashwagandha and EGCG from green tea seemed to be doing their job, subtly supporting my body in ways I didn’t think were possible. My overall mood was better too, and that made sticking to healthier choices easier.

Then came the weight loss. After a month, my clothes started fitting better, and the scale showed I’d lost a noticeable amount of weight without a strict diet or grueling workouts. My body felt lighter, my digestion had improved, and I was even sleeping better—possibly thanks to the adaptogenic herbs that help regulate stress and cortisol. By month three, I had dropped nearly 20 pounds, a milestone I hadn’t reached in years, even when I was doing intensive workouts.

One thing I appreciated was that *Nagano Tonic* isn’t marketed as a miracle weight-loss solution. Instead, it targets sustainable health, blending natural superfoods like camu camu and mangosteen that work with the body to boost metabolism, lower inflammation, and support overall vitality. Unlike other products that left me feeling deprived or anxious, *Nagano Tonic* felt gentle but effective.

For me, *Nagano Tonic* has become more than a supplement. It’s a system that helped me restore balance in my body, naturally curb cravings, boost my energy, and support healthy weight loss. I didn’t have to make radical changes; I simply added this tonic into my routine. It’s safe to say that it’s been one of the best investments in my health journey.

The science behind *Nagano Tonic* lies in its careful selection of natural ingredients, each chosen for its unique contribution to metabolism, energy, and weight management. This formula draws on traditional ingredients, blending them into a tonic that supports the body’s natural processes to promote a healthier, leaner physique without extreme diets or workouts. Let’s dive deeper into some of these powerful components and how they work together.

One of the standout ingredients is **Camu Camu**, a superfood high in vitamin C and antioxidants. Known for centuries in traditional medicine, camu camu works by boosting metabolism and offering a steady energy lift without caffeine. Its antioxidants also help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are often underlying contributors to weight gain and sluggishness. This allows the body to process fats and sugars more efficiently, directly supporting weight loss efforts.

Then there’s **Mangosteen**, a nutrient-packed fruit rich in fiber, which aids in feeling full and supports a balanced digestive system. This natural fiber not only promotes satiety but also enhances digestion, helping the body process and eliminate waste effectively. Mangosteen is also noted for containing xanthones, which have anti-inflammatory properties. By reducing inflammation, mangosteen may help improve metabolic health, making it easier to shed excess weight and maintain energy.

**EGCG**, a catechin found in green tea, is one of the most well-documented antioxidants. EGCG boosts metabolism and aids in fat burning, as several studies have shown. By increasing the thermogenic effect (the rate at which the body burns calories to produce heat), EGCG can amplify calorie-burning even without exercise. Furthermore, it’s known to enhance the body’s resilience to oxidative stress, another factor in maintaining a healthy metabolism.

A unique aspect of *Nagano Tonic* is its use of **adaptogenic herbs** like **Ashwagandha** and **Panax Ginseng**. Adaptogens help the body adapt to stress by stabilizing cortisol levels, which are often elevated in response to stress and can lead to fat storage, particularly around the abdomen. Ashwagandha is especially beneficial in managing cortisol, which in turn can reduce stress-induced cravings. Panax Ginseng, on the other hand, enhances vitality and supports mental clarity by helping regulate blood sugar, which may reduce the likelihood of energy crashes and associated cravings.

Lastly, **Momordica Charantia**, commonly known as bitter melon, plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. Bitter melon has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to use sugars more efficiently for energy instead of storing them as fat. This is particularly helpful for those who struggle with blood sugar management or experience sugar cravings.

*Nagano Tonic* isn’t just a weight loss supplement—it’s a multi-dimensional health tonic that supports the body’s metabolic and hormonal systems holistically. By integrating these scientifically backed ingredients, it offers a natural path to sustainable energy, effective metabolism, and balanced weight management.

**4. Is it safe for long-term use?**  
Yes. *Nagano Tonic* is designed for sustainable, long-term use, combining ingredients that support general health, not just short-term weight loss. Its adaptogenic herbs, probiotics, and antioxidants contribute to ongoing well-being, which can be beneficial beyond weight management.

**5. Does it require diet or exercise to be effective?**

**8. How is it different from other weight loss supplements?**  
Unlike many weight loss products, *Nagano Tonic* targets root causes of weight gain, such as stress, metabolic health, and cravings. Its unique blend of adaptogens, probiotics, and antioxidants works synergistically, promoting a holistic approach to health.

1gmbjzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutisticAdults/comments/1gmbjzz/you_should_probably_try_quitting_caffeine/,You should probably try quitting caffeine,"Yes I know many people will hate me just for saying this but hear me out. I used to have bad caffeine addiction. I had 200-600 mg per day for about 15 years. I've also ""always"" been a person with bad insomnia and anxiety. I never even thought about quitting caffeine, it seemed impossible. I NEEDED it to function. I wouldn't be able to do anything without it.

A couple months back I started to realize how bad that sounds. If I said the same about needing alcohol daily, would that be ok? So I made up my mind and decided to try to quit. I first tapered down, then switched to decaf coffee and herbal tea.

The first day I had a headache. But after a couple days I realized I the constant anxiety had lessened considerably, and I would fall asleep in 15 minutes which is insane for me. Yes I was irritable, tired and had trouble concentrating, but these symptoms slowly got better until at 1 month they had vanished completely.

So turns out I wasn't just an anxious sleepless person, I was just sensitive to caffeine and addicted on it. Of course I still have some anxiety but it's much less common now and usually has some sort of reason.

So maybe, just maybe you should try it too. If I can do it, you can do it! It's tough at first but the possible benefits are life-changing. And if it doesn't give you benefits you can always go back.

Edit: Yes I know some people with ADHD use caffeine to self medicate. I have AuDHD and have noticed my ADHD symptoms getting worse after quitting, but it is still so much worth it for the lessened anxiety for me. That's why I think everyone should try and see which option is better for them.",1,1731044451.0,AutisticAdults,12,0.56,False
1gmbjgy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greyhairreversal/comments/1gmbjgy/i_reversed_my_grey_hair/,I reversed my grey hair...,"I am a 35 year old male, with frankly beautiful chestnut brown hair. Nearly everyone in my family (Mom's side) goes grey rather early, so genetics are not on my side. 

I was rapidly going grey 3 years ago while helping my father who was dying from cancer, which naturally was a very stressful experience. I can recall being in his bathroom and seeing just how bad it was getting, cursing in disbelief...just another brutal part of life it seemed. 

Prior I was already slowly going grey, but this experience absolutely accelerated it to the point of alarm. My father passed and life moved on. 

Two summers ago I was out partying after a concert (dead and co at fenway) and I must have had 5 red bull vodka's that a friend kept buying me. Of course the next day I felt like absolute hell and the last thing I wanted was coffee, despite being a coffee lover (I'm a diehard cyclist...so cafe's are like church to us).

Well one day turned into two, then a week. And then a month. I decided I wanted to give up caffeine and in time it turned out to be the best decision I have ever made in my life. 

Years upon years of anxiety suddenly vanished. Social anxiety vanished. Sleep quality improved. Recovery from cycling improved. And most importantly I have nearly (95%) reversed my grey hair. The beauty of this is how having no anxiety continues to build upon itself making you more and more resilient to stress. I have never been so calm, centered or at peace with life in my entire existence, despite still working an extremely stressful job. Nothing bothers me anymore and I truly mean it. 

I am convinced cortisol is main cause of grey hair and I spent a lifetime filled with anxiety that did just that. 

I will never consume caffeine again for as long as I live. If I'm tired I eat real whole foods, namely organic fruit or fruit juice if I'm really dragging. Our body runs on glucose and caffeine is a completely fake version of ""energy"" that abuses our adrenaline system. Caffeine is literally a neurotoxin (that's obviously safe to consume) and our body reacts thinking we have been poisoned thus triggering the flight or fight system.

I cannot tell you how grateful I am for that one wild night out on the town and all those disgusting RBV's. ",5,1731044393.0,greyhairreversal,1,1.0,False
1gmbj63,https://www.reddit.com/r/ehlersdanlos/comments/1gmbj63/sensitive_to_everything_including_vibes/,sensitive to everything including vibes,"hi!! this is my first time posting here, and i normally don't feel very inclined to share the thoughts and personal theories i have. but my journey so far into becoming attuned with my own body and mind has been interesting and i wanted to see if anybody else has experiences/thoughts similar to mine! so i am 22/female, with adhd/somewhat overlapping autism symptoms. i am seeking a diagnosis right now, but i believe i have hED, although many of my symptoms are things i've experienced my entire life and never realized was a symptom to anything. i started to recognize them sometime after i got off birth control last year. about a year before, when i was 20, i was prescribed adderall to treat my adhd.
i began to process reality in a much more complex way for the first time, and soon found myself trying to understand my hormone cycle (i got an oura ring and started to track all of my mental and physical symptoms) and adjust my life the best that i could accordingly. i also recognize my brain is developing, and further life experiences yield further complexity to living. but all of these i believe have played a role in the acceleration of everything i have been learning about myself and how my life has changed since then. 

so anyway, i left my previous job (kfc, it was kinda brutal) this past april (2024) and then took a bit of a vacation of unemployment for a few months. in august i started a new job at this claw machine arcade and i love it, but the contrast of quiet and comfortable albeit brief isolation  made me very quickly aware of how comparatively overstimulating the whole world is. my job especially, which is accompanied with upbeat music playing out of each machine and bright LEDs everywhere. this compelled me to invest in a pair of those loop concert earplugs and blue-light blocking glasses, which proved exactly what i suspected when i noticed a dramatic difference in my anxiety, irritability, headaches, etc. when i wear these regularly. 

in addition, which this will all make sense in a bit when i explain the point of this, my skincare routine has led me to notice some...odd things about myself and how my skin operates. i read somewhere else that our pores are ""stretchier"" like the rest of our skin, thus the baby face. 
well i had a friend who i used to work with that has a few different autoimmune disorders (side note: if i never met her i honestly wouldn't have began to consider having one myself, because we had SO many strange crazy things in common that i had never before spent conscious time recognizing in myself alone. i don't know if she has ED at all, but i know she did have hasimoto's, psoriasis, and a few others) and i remember her telling me that a weird symptom she noticed was that if she consumed anything with food coloring in it, if she took a bath that day then her bath water would turn that color. i haven't tested this specifically on myself yet, but something similar that i noticed with myself is that for whatever reason, i start my skincare with an oil cleanser (takes off makeup and stuff then i wash with a regular face wash)...and i'm only assuming that this is connected to hED because i swear everything is lmao, but when i use that oil cleanser i feel REBORN. like it will remove everything from every pore on my face. and if i've eaten anything with a lot of spice of any kind that day or the last few days, i can literally smell it mix with the oil if i cleanse for long enough. there was one week where i basically only ate the same brand and type of frozen chicken tenders almost every day, and at one point it clicked in my head while i was doing my skincare that i noticed the same smell as whatever they're seasoned with. another instance: i am obsessed with this iced chai from a small coffee place in my area, and for a few days in a row i really drank a decent amount of them...doing my skincare, and suddenly i smell cinnamon. crazy. but in conclusion to this part of the post, my skin and body in general are just...sensitive. i spent so long scrolling through this community, and it has led me to realize SO much about everything i've ever experienced. why my hand never stopped hurting from taking notes (i wasn't just lazy!!), why i hold my pencil weirdly, why my lips are perpetually chapped without aquaphor, why even the slightest bit of friction makes me turn red, etc...so to break it down, whether it's all related to ED specifically or not, as someone with so many symptoms i've recognized that a huge underlying connection in every symptom is that we are sensitive to EVERYTHING. sound, light, physical touch, food, medicine, gravity, literally even air pressure.

as i wrap this up i want to also mention that i am a pretty spiritual person (not religious, just highly aware of the interconnectedness of everything and the energies that exist too) mostly due to trauma and experience and such, but also because i am empathetic and sensitive to those around me as well. that being said...all of this has really had me wondering, that if energy and ""vibrations"" are just as physical as they are mental/spiritual/emotional, and if our joints are more sensitive to pressure/gravity, and our lungs are more sensitive to air, and our skin is more sensitive to whatever touches it, and our ears are more sensitive to sound vibrations, and our eyes are more sensitive to light vibrations...doesn't it make sense that we would also be more sensitive to other vibrations? although these are mystical concepts and quite ambiguous, so we don't really understand how it all works, i definitely have a childlike sense of ""anything is possible."" there's a book i read a while back that stuck on me was called ""thought vibrations""...and it basically describes that much like every other form of vibration, thought vibrations exist as well and entangle us. like, have you ever had an idea, or thought about something, and then even if you don't say anything about it or forget entirely, someone else says it out loud around you sometime later and it's just way too specific and you're kinda like wtf. and, i can't speak for anybody else, but personally when i say i'm empathetic i am also anxious af and can't stand to be in a room full of people that are full of negative words or thoughts or feelings. which i'm sure that even non empathetic people can agree that being around somebody that is in a bad mood doesn't feel great, even if that feeling is only a little uncomfortable. 

i could go into even more depth on my observations that relate to all of this, but this post is long enough and i'm honestly just so curious to see if my crazy hypothesis has any tether to the real world lol.

so, has anybody else ever had a thought like this? or has anybody ever noticed anything similar that they are ""sensitive"" to, even if you think it would have nothing to do w ED?

thank u for reading!

So far I talked to several girls and some have eventually unfollowed me too on Instagram for no reason even though things were fine in person and with some there has been good conversation but things seem to be moving way too slow and the unfollowing has been making me feel worse. So I decided to ask out each girls with whom I had some conversations in person. I would ask them to either grab a cup of coffee with me or maybe come for lunch with me to this nearby Jack's Bar. With most of these girls I had some conversations for a few days to couple of weeks so I am definitely not asking out full strangers. It will just be a numbers game I guess and one would definitely say yes plus it would make me look more confident. What do you feel? Should I go for it next week?

There are other negatives I can pick at, but this one is the main problem that I believe most players can agree needs to be changed.

In my country, getting a cup of coffee is around $4-7 USD. Spending $100 for straight conversion to luxite, yields a little more than 40 pulls. And to hit pity for a new character is 180 pulls, characters that come out every 2 weeks. 

From a business standpoint if you’re targeting whales, it’s still not worth it for them. To get a 5 star character, from pulls alone is nearly impossible. Spending 200 dollars on the monthly summon packages (which give a better deal), I’ve gotten lucky enough to get 2 more copies of Auguste and that was considered really lucky. Because i won the 50/50 twice in around 80 pulls. I still need 200 shards which I’m happy to farm out, but thinking about it, you need at least 1000 or so dollars to hope that you can 5 star a character. Even for a rich whale, I doubt it’s easy to spend 2000 dollars a month on this game. 

The rewards from codes and mail is so small that it pisses me off. Just don’t bother giving us rewards if it’s not a ten pull because what’s the point? I could keep losing 50/50s over and over and I would need 180 150luxite to guarantee I copy of a character. It’s just no point.

Just give players more rewards, what is the downside? You want us to spend more and it would incentivize us a lot more if we thought we had a chance. But there is no hope. 

The devlogs are great, but I really recommend hiring a translator to help with the communication issue because from my point of view I haven’t seen that much evidence that players voices were heard on this, both from CN and global. 

I want this game to do well. But unless monetary incentives strategies change quickly, I can foresee a lot more players leaving because of how bad the gacha summon resources are.",15,1731044070.0,SwordofConvallaria,1,0.86,False

1gmbftg,https://i.redd.it/ph1s213k6mzd1.jpeg,How do I decide between using 3D or 2D for my product video?,"“To 3D or Not to 3D, That Is the Question… for Your Product Video!”

🔍 “Zooming in on 2D vs. 3D – Like, Really Zooming In”
Alright, picture this: You’ve got the next big product to hit the market. It's sleek, it’s cutting-edge, it's… a kitchen gadget? A tech toy? No matter! Now the BIG question is, should it spin around the screen in glorious 3D, or keep things simple with a 2D charm? Should we go full Inception, or keep it more Looney Tunes?

🎢 “The Roller Coaster of 3D Magic”
3D has that wow factor, right? You can make a product look like it’s about to leap off the screen and hand itself over to your audience. Plus, it adds depth (literally). Think of a sleek espresso machine twirling like it’s auditioning for a Marvel movie. You get to show every angle, every glossy curve, every hidden feature. But beware! 3D is like that friend who insists on bringing their entire camera setup to a picnic—it’s impressive but can take time, a bigger budget, and a director’s level of patience.

🎨 “Keeping It Real (Simple) with 2D”
Now, let’s look at 2D. It’s classic, straightforward, and gets right to the point. 2D is your friend who brings snacks, tells the best stories, and gets along with everyone. 2D is great for explainers, quick animations, and when you need to break down complex ideas without a lot of fuss. Imagine a cute animated hand pouring coffee into a cup. It’s clear, charming, and no 3D modeling is going to delay things by a month.

💸 “The Budget Buster or Saver”
If you’re balling on a budget, 2D is usually more affordable. It doesn’t require the same tech gymnastics as 3D. But if you’re going all out and want the cinematic glitz and glam? Well, then maybe 3D is worth the splurge. It’s like asking, “Do we want takeout pizza, or are we going for the full chef’s tasting menu?” Both can hit the spot, but your wallet might prefer one.

👓 “The Focus Factor – When It’s All About Detail”
Sometimes, your product’s all about the tiny details—say, high-end watch gears or intricate patterns. In these cases, 3D is like inviting your audience to look closer…closer…even closer. But if your product is simpler, you don’t need that magnifying glass effect. Let 2D keep things snappy and clean, especially for quicker platforms like social media.

🎉 “So, What’s the Verdict?”
If your product needs that “wow” factor, and you have the time and budget, go 3D. If you’re looking for something concise, fun, and a little lighter on the pocket? Stick with 2D. Either way, remember: the goal is to make your product unforgettable. Whether it’s a rotating masterpiece or a snappy animation, make it something your audience can’t scroll past.

My ex (35F) broke up with me (36M) 1.5 years ago a day after her birthday. We spent it at her family's house.

She broke up with me via text and wouldn't speak to me on the phone. Pure avoidant deactivation style at the peek of our relationship. I chased for a bit, but threw in the towel and began to heal.

Fast forward and I spent the last 1.5 years moving on. I'm in a masters program and doing great other than romance. My ex reached out to me and apologized last Tuesday. She seemed sincere. 

We exchanged texts and caught up and she seems to be in a better place. She said she hadn't dated at all since our breakup. She lives at home due the housing market and her lower earnings (she's a hairstylist).

She asked me out to coffee Sunday and we had a fun time together catching up. I was excited to see her, but my guard was up. She didn't know that, but it was. I was hesitant to accept the coffee date, but I'm glad I went.

She was more open and vulnerable with me. She seemed comfortable. Since then, she's been texty and invited me for a long hike (6+ hours) this weekend. I feel this would be a great opportunity to catch up more and feel her out. However, I'm a bit ambivalent.

I was discarded so quickly and out of the blue that I'm scared it will happen again. I believe her that she's worked on herself, however attachment is such an automatic trigger when it happens. She won't even know when it hits.

I also don't want to overload her with too many heavy topics. I just want to enjoy her company and see where everything goes. I'm finding my feelings for her coming back which is scary given our history.

Any advice for anyone who has been in this situation? I believe her to be an FA. Prior to me, she has a history of toxic partners. She acknowledged her poor choices and said she wasn't at a place to accept me because she didn't know how to. While I do believe her words, I'm not sure if she does if that makes sense. Again, attachment is automatic. 

Her family approved of me. I got along with them well. She met mine too, and I felt she was the one.

She was incredibly consistent and affectionate with me during our relationship until she wasn't. But she did acknowledge her shortcomings and apologize. I'm just not sure if her discard of me was entirely attachment based or due to her prior trauma (when we had started to date she had only been 3 months removed from a toxic relationship which involved a restraining order. I was unaware at the time).

She's been more flirty and eager to see me via text. I wouldn't call it love bombing per se as we have history. But I sense her excitement. I just don't know when the appropriate time is to have ""the future talk"" so she knows my boundaries. We have similar values, views for the future, and hobbies and interests. Everything is there, except the attachment/trauma question mark.

I forgave her a long time ago. If she has healed and won't leave me again, I'd be overjoyed to have her in my life. I'm at a place now where if I did bring up the convo and she ran for the hills I'd be at peace, but have some doubt that I made the wrong move by not taking things slow. 

On the other hand, falling in love with her again and being discarded I just can't have happen again. I have therapy scheduled for next week to discuss this all with my therapist as well.

Thank you all.",3,1731042798.0,attachment_theory,1,1.0,False

  Here's how it started, [im me M30] 3 years ago the person I truly loved and felt like actual family cheated on me and left me, took my dog too, she made me leave the house fast, I couldn't find a place that can take pets I had to live with friends for a year.. and she asked to keep her and have her together for emotional support. She was scared to live alone. Me I was loving her so I said yes.
   After some time I learned that our friends secretly hade her live in on of their apartments , the dog was living with her mother, and everyone was ghosting me. So I lost my love, my dog, and the self entitled ""best friends"".
   Some time later my childhood best friend out of nowhere stopped talking to me and some other people. Like switching a light. We suspect hes having trouble with drugs, but he lives to the other side of the country and cant find him.
   Then I made some friend, really good people but...  no connection, everyone found a relationship and stop going out. My other nest friend from school has a relationship too and works to much so we see each other once per month... I had 3 short ended relationships all that time. First after 2 months she told me we can't see each other because she was cheating on her bf all this time... next one wanted a poly and basically we all broke up with her because she was going out with 4 guys just fucking. Next one was a psycho, she was hitting me hurting me and talking really bad ti me..  
   I really want my old life back... I feel so alone.  I don't want to make new friend or new love. I know thats my only option and im trying,  but I'm a very difficult person now. After all that I have been so closed to myself and tired of everything, on top of that I fucking hate the world as it is... 
And on top on top of all that every second day or so I will see very vivid dreams with my friends or that im back with my ex that i so loved, or i see some random person that we get together and we love each other. And I wake up in this dark reality very early with only 15 minutes to get ready for work, and now actually I don't work and I expected for this to change but no. Before I even get a grasp of reality I start crying and my first thoughts is to kill myself, them I kinda get back on track and I make coffee and live another day in this painfully bad written theater, watching the show day by day...

1gmaz78,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyphonixYT/comments/1gmaz78/hyphonix_the_master_of_skipping_reddit_recaps/,Hyphonix: The Master of Skipping Reddit Recaps,"**Hyphonix: The Master of Skipping Reddit Recaps... Or So He Thinks.**

There’s a curious phenomenon that has been bubbling up in the streaming community, particularly in the Hyphonix realm, where John Sacadorian has turned Reddit recaps into his own personal version of an obstacle course. At first, it was subtle. The odd time skip here and there, a delay in addressing posts, an occasional disregard for the flow of the daily grind. But it has escalated into something far more... profound. John’s attempt to save time during his streams, all while navigating the chaotic sea of Reddit comments and memes, has somehow led to an intricate dance of procrastination that might be the very definition of irony.

For those of you who aren’t familiar with the premise of John’s streams—Hyphonix, the streamer behind the channel, frequently dives into Reddit threads, particularly those that his community members post. It's a staple of his content, a way to engage directly with his audience and react to the memes, the jokes, and the ever-evolving inside jokes that come from his fanbase. But, as it often goes with streaming, things never seem to go as smoothly as they are planned. 

### The 'Skip-Recap' Phenomenon

In an attempt to expedite the process, John, like so many streamers, began skipping certain posts during his Reddit recap sessions. At first, it was understandable. We all know how these recaps can drag on—meme after meme, post after post, thread after thread—leading to a long session that could easily stretch for hours. To ""save time"" (and perhaps avoid the perceived ""dead air"" or ""boring moments""), John would skip posts that didn’t immediately grab his attention or didn’t generate enough of a reaction. It was his way of streamlining, of “cutting out the fluff.”

But in his quest to “save time,” something rather ironic started to happen. The very act of skipping posts created a time loop of its own. In trying to avoid long pauses, John only prolonged the inevitable. The posts that he skipped would pile up, stack on top of one another, creating an even bigger backlog. The more he skipped, the more the backlog grew, like a snowball rolling down a hill—becoming more and more difficult to manage. In an attempt to save minutes, he’d end up with a backlog that would stretch his Reddit recap far longer than it needed to be. 

It became a classic case of ""effort paradox."" The more John tried to simplify, the more complicated it became. For every post he skipped, ten more seemed to appear, and suddenly, his attempt at efficiency only served to delay the inevitable. He was caught in a recursive loop of time-saving, and the result was that his recaps became longer, more chaotic, and even more convoluted. Time saved was time lost. 

### The Ego Trip

Now, let’s talk about John’s ego, which is, for better or worse, an integral part of his streaming identity. The thing about John Sacadorian is that over time, as his viewership grew and his popularity soared, his ego blossomed to match. That’s not to say it’s unfounded—he’s a talented, charismatic streamer with a strong following. But in recent months, there’s been an undeniable sense of... well, *overconfidence* creeping into the process.

It’s one thing to be self-assured; it’s another thing to believe that your way is the only way. In many ways, John’s attempts to “perfect” the Reddit recap became more about his personal brand than about what his community wanted to see. He became obsessed with the idea of efficiency, of doing things ""his way,"" but it came at the expense of actually engaging with the content properly. There’s a difference between optimizing for speed and sacrificing quality, and it seems like John may have crossed that line.

And the truth is, people are starting to notice. The once-engaging Reddit recaps have started to feel rushed, detached, and, frankly, somewhat hollow. The posts are being skimmed, skipped, and passed over, leading to a sense that John’s focus is elsewhere—his ego and desire for perfection making him less willing to slow down and connect with his audience in a real way.

### Enter Tyler: The Creamer in the Coffee

Which brings us to Tyler, the unsung hero, the true antidote to this problem. Tyler has often played a secondary role in John’s streams, sometimes hosting or managing elements of the show, but it’s clear to anyone who watches that he has something special about him. In contrast to John’s somewhat chaotic approach to streaming, Tyler is like a beautiful bottle of creamer poured into a cup of coffee—smooth, comforting, and perfectly balanced. 

Tyler has a knack for engaging with the content without overthinking it, reacting to posts with a refreshing sense of genuine curiosity, without the burden of trying to constantly ""optimize"" or cut corners. Where John might be skipping or rushing, Tyler would pause, appreciate, and dive into the nuances of what’s being shared. He brings a level of warmth and relatability that has often been overshadowed by John’s frenetic energy.

Now, imagine if Tyler were given the reins to the entire Reddit recap for a while. Maybe it’s time for John to take a step back and let Tyler host the channel, allowing him to bring his unfiltered, calm, and approachable personality to the forefront. Perhaps the recaps would return to the days when they felt more genuine—less about speed and more about connection. Tyler has an incredible ability to ground the content, to keep the conversation flowing without pushing it toward the “efficient” corners that John so desperately seems to gravitate toward. He has the perfect balance of spontaneity and composure.

Plus, let’s be real, viewers might find the dynamic shift refreshing. There’s something about Tyler’s energy that allows him to handle the chaos with a grace that John, in his quest for efficiency, often misses. It’s like when you’re sipping on your coffee, and you’re about to add that perfect splash of creamer—you know it’s going to elevate the whole experience. Tyler could be the creamer to John’s coffee, the one who smooths out the rough edges and brings the warmth back to the community’s Reddit recaps.

### A Time for Change?

So, let’s put it out there—maybe it’s time for John to let Tyler take the reins for a while. Maybe it’s time to focus on quality over quantity, on engagement over optimization, and on connection over cutting corners. The viewers, the community, and the content deserve a more holistic approach to the Reddit recaps—one where posts are not skipped, where the funny and absurdity is fully appreciated, and where the flow of the stream doesn’t get derailed by the endless desire to “cut out the fluff.” 

In the end, it’s all about balance. And in this case, the balance might just come from letting go of control, allowing Tyler to step into the spotlight, and seeing where the Reddit recap journey takes us next. Maybe it’s time for John to let the beautiful bottle of creamer pour itself into the cup and savor the experience.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fnhg5n/aita_for_cutting_off_my_daughters_college_fund/) **September 23, 2024**

I’m a single dad to my 18-year-old daughter, Emma. Her bio mom left us when she was young, and I’ve raised her with the help of my wife, who has been a wonderful mother figure. Recently, Emma started reconnecting with her bio mom, and I initially supported this, hoping it would be a positive experience.

However, it quickly became apparent that her bio mom hadn’t changed. Emma began making excuses for her and started exhibiting increasingly hostile behavior toward my wife. She would say things like, “Maybe I’ll just move in with my mom and leave you both behind,” and “You’re not my real mom anyway, so what do you care?” It escalated to threats where she implied she would ruin our lives if we tried to stop her from pursuing this relationship.

During a heated argument, Emma expressed her desire to move in with her bio mom. This was the breaking point for me. Feeling that I needed to set boundaries, I decided to cut off her college fund and told her she had to leave our home.

Since then, my family has been vocal about their disapproval. They believe I should have been more understanding and that I overreacted. Some even argue that I’m pushing her further away and harming our relationship permanently. They think I should have tried harder to support her rather than resorting to such drastic measures.

AITA for taking this step, or was I justified in cutting her off?

**Update 1:**

Thanks to everyone who commented on my original post. I didn’t expect to have an update so quickly, but a lot has happened in just the past few hours.

About five hours after I posted, I got a message from Emma asking if we could meet up. She suggested a nearby coffee shop, and although I was unsure of what to expect, I agreed to meet her.

When I arrived, I could tell right away that something was different. Emma looked exhausted and stressed, not at all like the confident person who left our home. She told me that her time with her bio mom had been a disaster. Not only had her mom treated her coldly, but she also demanded an exorbitant amount of money for rent—far more than Emma could afford. It became clear to Emma that her mom wasn’t interested in having a real relationship with her, just in using her for financial gain.

Emma was visibly upset as she apologized for the way she had treated me and my wife. She admitted that she’d made a huge mistake and asked if she could come back home. It was obvious she was genuinely remorseful, and she said she realized now how much we had done for her.

I told her that I’m willing to work on rebuilding our relationship, but it’s going to take time and effort on both sides. We discussed setting some boundaries and working through the issues that led to all of this in the first place. She agreed, and we left the coffee shop with a plan to move forward, one step at a time.

It’s not going to be an easy road, but I’m hopeful that we can heal from this and come out stronger on the other side. I’m still processing everything, but I’m relieved that Emma wants to make things right.

**Update 2:**

Hey everyone, I’ve got another update, and things have gotten even more intense since my last post.

A day after Emma and I reconciled, her bio mom showed up at our house. I didn’t expect her to come here, but she was furious, screaming about how I had “taken her daughter away” and how I was trying to turn Emma against her. She was completely out of control, and it quickly became clear that she wasn’t going to leave peacefully. I tried to calm her down, but nothing worked, so I had no choice but to call the cops.

When the police arrived, Emma was visibly shaken. As they escorted her mom away, Emma asked me to press charges. She was done with her mom’s manipulations and wanted to protect herself from any further harm.

While we were dealing with the fallout, Emma mentioned that her bio mom had access to her credit card. We decided to check her account, and that’s when we discovered something shocking—her mom had taken out $10,000 without Emma’s knowledge. We were both stunned and heartbroken.

After reporting the theft to the police, we started doing some digging of our own. We found out that Emma’s bio mom was drowning in debt. She’d been using Emma as a financial lifeline, which explained the outrageous demands for rent and the recent theft. She was desperate and willing to do anything to get her hands on more money.

We provided all the evidence to the police, and they’re now investigating her for fraud. Emma is devastated but also relieved that the truth is coming to light. We’re working with the bank to try to recover the stolen money, and I’ve hired a lawyer to help us navigate the legal process.

This whole situation has been incredibly tough on Emma, but she’s been strong through it all. We’re focusing on moving forward and rebuilding trust. I’m grateful that she came back home when she did because who knows how much worse things could have gotten if she’d stayed with her mom any longer.

It’s going to take time to heal from all of this, but we’re on the right path now. Emma knows she has our full support, and we’re committed to helping her get through this. I’m just glad we caught on to what was happening before it was too late.

**OOP on his wife’s role in his daughter’s life as a stepmom/maternal figure**

> **OOP:** my wife has been her maternal figure ever since she was 3 so she has a say in it and also the bio mom has never raised a finger in raising...i raised her and always gave her what she wanted to a certain extent though

**Commenter 1:** Yta you are in your feelings and not being understanding and a parent , you are upset because she’s rejecting your wife , you are disregarding her feelings when she says u loved your wife more instead of asking why does she feel like that , u may think your wife is this great person but she may not be to your daughter, you’re protecting your wife because your daughter is rejecting her , allow her space to navigate that relationship w her mom w/o u punishing her

> **OOP:** I have seen first hand how my wife treats my daughter...to be exact she did all the work for my daughter as my wife is sterile and would help in holiday hw maths and even hug her and my daughter would always praise her when i asked her if she had any problems with her

**Commenter 2:** Yes. You are being petty. She's an adult now and she wants to establish a relationship with her mom. For you to punish her for choices that have nothing to do with her college education is incredibly irresponsible and makes you just as bad as her mom.

> **OOP:** her mom abandoned her and never looked back until she was 18 obviously am compelled

**Commenter 3:** Just let her figure out that her bio mom is a piece of shit that's the best way to go about it

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fodzh9/title_aita_for_cutting_off_my_daughters_college/): **September 24, 2024**

Hey everyone, I’ve got another update, and this one has been extremely difficult for our family.

After we pressed charges and discovered the theft of $10,000 from Emma’s credit card, her bio mom started harassing us nonstop. It started with constant phone calls and text messages—both to me and Emma—begging, demanding, and threatening us to drop the lawsuit. She even began showing up at our workplaces. At my office, she caused a scene, screaming at the receptionist to let her in, calling me a “thief” and claiming I was “ruining her life.” Emma’s job wasn’t spared either. Her bio mom went there too, embarrassing her in front of her coworkers and even threatening to expose personal details about our family if we didn’t drop the charges.

We tried to block her out, but things came to a head when she showed up at our house again. This time, she was even more out of control. She started screaming and calling my wife all kinds of vile names, including a “nasty whore,” claiming she had “stolen” Emma from her. We tried to get her to leave, but she refused.

And then it happened—she physically attacked my wife. She shoved her into a wall and started hitting and scratching her. Emma and I were in complete shock. My wife was just trying to defend herself, but her bio mom kept coming at her. Seeing my wife terrified and hurt was my breaking point. I immediately called the cops.

When the police arrived, they arrested her for assault. My wife is now traumatized from the incident—she’s been struggling with anxiety and can’t sleep well, knowing that she was physically attacked in her own home. She’s seeing a therapist to try to deal with the emotional scars left from this nightmare.

Emma is devastated too. She never imagined her bio mom would go this far, and seeing her attack my wife has left her shaken. We’re doing everything we can to support each other, but the impact has been immense.

Now, with her bio mom in custody and facing multiple charges, including assault and harassment, we’re hoping we can finally find some peace. It’s hard to believe how far this situation has escalated, but I’m glad that, at least for now, we’re safe from further harassment. We’ll be taking legal steps to ensure a restraining order is in place moving forward.

This has been a painful chapter for my family, but we’re determined to get through it together. Thank you again for all your support during this time—it’s been a lifeline for us.

**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!Gaslighting, verbal abuse!< 

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/bOwazmqZow)  **Jan 29, 2022** 

So yeah like title says, we were both remote workers and decided that we could van life and see things while still working. We lasted about a month and last week he flipped out over the way I sipped my coffee and told me I had to leave. I thought he meant like we would pack up and figure out how to get me home. No he meant I needed to get out with all my shit in the middle of of a state park in New Mexico and figure it out. I was scared and pissed so I hurriedly packed everything and got out. 

A very nice older couple had heard the screaming and saw me with a pile of my stuff and asked if I needed help. I said yes and they said they would drive me to Albuquerque in their RV and we could figure out what would happen next. Well it turns out they are the sweetest people ever and We eventually came to the conclusion it would be easier for me to travel with them home to Kansas and Now they’ve allowed me to stay paying them insanely fair rent, food, etc… I just have to edit the wife’s book and help the husband with his guitar playing. 

Well it turns out in the hurry of packing I grabbed my ex’s watch That was his dads. I got in touch with him and told him
I was sorry, it was truly an accident and I had no intention of keeping it-how would he like me to get it to him? He said I needed to meet him in Utah. I said that was ridiculous, I could send it to him. He said that it was too valuable to trust to mail or fedex and needed to be hand relieved. I said I was in Kansas and not coming to Utah, but I would return the watch to his brother when I go home in march. He said no the “only” solution was for me to drive it to him. I said I didn’t even have a car. He said “you’re probably fucking half of Lawrence, use one of theirs.” At that point I blocked him. 

The watch is pretty valuable and has a lot of sentimental value and I will return it. It was my oversight that I have it in the first place. What are my obligations to follow his instructions to get the watch back to him? 

Edit: wow this blew up! For the people asking it is a lower end Rolex watch. It still has all the original box and even receipt when his dad bought it but it was well worn so he’s never been sure how much it’s worth, I guess a few hundred-maybe a thousand so I’m not sure. I’m not going to keep it or destroy it since it’s not mine in any way.

>You gave reasonable options. Let’s say he files a police report that you stole it. You have proof that you contacted him and asked where you could send it. He declined.

**nevertoomuchthought** 

>Dude sounds like a psychopath. Do not under any circumstances willingly meet up with him in person ever again. Don't let him know where you live. This level of douchery is a sign of something being very off and you don't want to be there again when he short circuits again. You were extremely lucky to have found the people you did. Who knows where you'd be if that had not happened. 

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/Z0OThBJQXL)  **Feb 6, 2022 (1 week later)** 

So I posted exactly a week ago. Link below but short story was I was van-living with ex boyfriend, he kicked me out after temper tantrum and I caught a ride with some awesome people. I discovered I has ex’s dads watch that had lots of sentimental value. I told him, asked where I should send it- he demanded I drive from Kansas to Utah and return it even though I don’t have a car. 

https://old.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/sfjjnf/exbf_and_i_were_vanlifing_across_country_he/ 

Well so lots of mixed advice but most people said best option was to contact his brother. Before I did that I decided to unblock my ex just to give him one more chance to give me an address where I could ship the watch.  

Actual text conversation: 

Me: hey, I’m sorry I blocked you. I just didn’t appreciate the insults but I want to get ur dads watch back. Can you let me know where to send it? I’ll pay for shipping no problem. 

Like less than 30 seconds later: 

Him:  I stashed the watch in your bag because I wanted to Prove to myself what an awful person you are and good job at proving me right again. 


I was like wow, so many people in the original said that he probably put the watch in my stuff as I was packing in order to force communication and force the opportunity to see him again. Well…you were exactly correct. I didn’t even respond to his text and blocked him again. 

I have no intention of keeping the watch so I decided now it was time to contact his brother (who, along with his wife has always been very nice to me). He was super appreciative and we spent a couple days going back and forth figuring out the shipping but the watch arrived to him on Friday and all is good. He even Venmoed me $1000 for being so honest, contacting him, etc… I make really good money so I told him it wasn’t necessary at all but he insisted so we agreed to donate it to a food pantry here in Lawrence.


But I’m still so creeped out thinking at the day when he kicked me out of the van and he was screaming at me, calling me all sorts of names he scheming to stay in touch with me. He was slamming all my stuff into bags but that was cover for him hiding the watch. The fact that it was so deliberate yet he thought of it so quickly is so scary to me. 

We got along so well before we left and he always seemed like such a great guy. I don’t know if the confined space of the van is too much for any couple or if it brought out a side of him I didn’t know was there. Makes me sad and scared at the same time…but relieved it’s over.

**pistachiopanda4** 

>>What I dont get is his logic that this would *prove* OP's a bad person. How the fuck was she supposed to know about the watch when you kicked her ass out in a state she didn't know about it until *after* she got to safety, possibly thousands of miles away? Like you thought she was just gonna be running back to you? Fuck that dude.

Story time - So earlier tonight my former best friend decided to leave me.

I have a hard time opening up to people and I have trust issues which I told her from the start. I also told her I was having a hard time emotionally today because of current things I'm going through and she decided to send me over a paragraph of why I can't be her friend, and I'm pretty sure she blocked me because I couldn't even send a message back. She was someone I stayed up till the next day on discord with just to make sure she was okay when she was feeling down or couldn't sleep. I always tried my best to cheer her up, even when I was feeling down. So now I'm just here, trying to get over it. I'd like to think she has grown as a person and doesn't need me anymore. Because it's hard for me to open up or trust people easily, this friendship meant a lot to me. My heart is like a little teacup and today a wrecking ball came through the cafe. I don't cry often but I might actually cry tonight. Thank you for reading and I hope you have a good night/day.

Alyssa Mercante, who was a Senior Editor, announced she’s leaving Kotaku.

In a post to X, Mercante wrote, “Work news: After exactly two years, I’ve decided to leave Kotaku and my role as senior editor. I am eternally grateful for Kotaku’s editorial team and all that they taught me during my time there. They are some of the best in the business, and I will be forever proud to have shared a masthead with them. They continuously fight to maintain the editorial pillars that make Kotaku great and hold onto their journalistic integrity in the face of increasing pressure to compromise that.”

She added, “It’s been a long few months, during which I’ve learned a lot about myself and my value as both a woman and a writer. This is the right decision for me. I have some things coming down the pike, so keep your eyes peeled.”

In a subsequent post, she claimed her decision to leave the outlet was made before layoffs were announced.

As for what Mercante has “coming down the pike,” YouTuber Hypnotic predicted she “will most likely be a DEI Consultant for SBI, the company she ran damage control for.”

Mercante did recently share that she was at Compulsion Games, which is located in Montreal, Canada, the same city where Sweet Baby Inc. is located.

Furthermore, Sweet Baby Inc. is consulting on South of Midnight, which is currently being developed by Compulsion Games.

Despite Mercante touting journalistic integrity in her post about leaving Kotaku, she infamously ran cover for Sweet Baby Inc. back in March and made it a point not to include the facts that Sweet Baby Inc. employees attempted to harass Brazilian gamer KabrutusRambo, get his Sweet Baby Inc. detected Steam curator list shut down, and get his entire Steam account banned.

Rather Mercante painted Sweet Baby Inc. as the victims and a harmless design company despite Sweet Baby Inc. CEO Kim Belair sharing in 2019 that employees at large AAA studios should terrify executives with social media cancel mobs.

She said during a Game Developers Conference, “If you’re creative working in AAA, which I did for many years, put this stuff up to your higher-ups. And if they don’t see the value and what you’re asking for when you ask for consultants, when you ask for research, go have a coffee with your marketing team and just terrify them with the possibility of what’s going to happen if they don’t give you what you want.”",2,1731041712.0,Games_Piracy,1,1.0,False

Here’s why:
	
1.	Building Trust and Credibility
Imagine being a customer searching for a product or service, and you can’t find anything about a company online. Feels suspicious, right? An online presence (website, social media, reviews) builds trust and makes your business appear credible and established. People are more likely to engage with and buy from a business that feels “real” to them.
	
2.	Reaching Your Audience
With billions of people online, there’s a massive opportunity to reach potential customers far beyond your physical location. Platforms like Google, LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook allow you to target specific audiences who might be interested in what you offer. The internet breaks down geographical barriers, giving you a much broader reach.
	
3.	Competing in the Modern Market
In virtually every industry, competitors are already working hard to be seen online. Ignoring online visibility essentially gives them an advantage. A strong online presence levels the playing field, helping even smaller businesses compete against bigger brands.
	
4.	Generating More Leads and Sales
Visibility drives traffic, which leads to more inquiries, leads, and ultimately, sales. Whether through SEO, content marketing, or social media engagement, online visibility helps you connect with people already interested in what you offer.
	
5.	Providing Value and Staying Top of Mind
When you’re active online, you have countless opportunities to offer value (tips, insights, solutions). This positions your business as a go-to resource, keeping you at the top of your audience’s mind. Plus, it makes it easier for people to refer your business since they know where to find you online.
	
6.	Adapting to Consumer Behavior
Consumers today research online before making buying decisions. If you’re not visible, you’re missing out on a huge chunk of potential customers who are looking for information and reassurance before they commit to a purchase.

The Bottom Line

Online visibility isn’t just about being seen; it’s about creating a brand that’s recognizable, trusted, and accessible. 

Whether you’re a local coffee shop or a global SaaS company, building an online presence is one of the most effective ways to grow your business and stay relevant.

I dont know what to do. Things are so bad right now. I have never been this desperate my whole life. 

(I will not say where I am from for safety reasons, please dont try to figure it out my paranoia is bad enough already thank you)

There is no help or support for autism here. There is nothing, only ABA and Autism Sp**ks-like mentality. And I will k**l myself before I subject myself to that, especially after finally finding freedom and ridding myself of all that medical psychiatric institution stuff I had to deal with my whole life. After living in pain for nearly 20 years and every single day being traumatic, being free has made me feel ok for the first time, but that means being alone with no support and it's starting to be unmanageable.

I am very present in the online autism community, on top of autism being a special interest for me, I educate myself and I try to know all there is to know. After 6 years I have a pretty clear understanding of everything related to autism, I wrote a 100 page presentation about it with just the basics, I know more than anyone in this place will ever know. I see all these people online getting help, whether it's the right help or the bare minimum, and I just feel helpless and desperate knowing I'm the one who cannot access that, I don't know how I will survive. I cannot feed or wash myself reliably, I have a job for 6 hours a week that I was able to score and keep only because I'm pretty much the only ""qualified"" (I'm not really even qualified for it) person in the area (basically only requirement is knowing english and mostly no one else does), but even that I fear I might lose any day. Even then it's not enough to keep me alive and not something I can do longterm anyway.

I was thinking if only I could get on disability maybe I could apply for a support worker. But that is looking more and more impossible the more I think about it and try to do it. I need to redo all my diagnoses and I need to reach a certain ""level"" of disability to qualify. I therefore need someone who actually knows what autism is and can diagnose it properly (especially cause the first time it didn't happen) and they can build a file with detailed and correct information on the help I need. Such person does not exist here. Everywhere is just ABA and people trying to beat you up in the hopes you'll turn allistic or at least force you to pretend to be. But let's say I magically found this person, I actually made it and applied for disability with correct information and unbiased screening. Support workers are just watered down nurses who didn't finish middle school and were stuck cleaning old people's butts in care homes. They cannot even treat old people fairly, but somehow they put them in charge of disabled kids. It's either that or again, the ABA therapists.

I grew up severely abuse and neglected, was in the system, obviously did not get adopted, mostly because in this country that's not a real thing. You hear every so often of parents murdering their children here it's just the norm, most people even defend them, so my situation was a joke in comparison. I aged out, managed to somewhat free myself and live alone for almost 2 years, but this is not a sustainable way of life, I am barely surviving and there is nothing to do about it. My friends struggle with their mental health and they got turned down from the only public service that exists because they do not have doctors working to be able to see patients. I don't understand why no one is talking about any of this, I don't understand how thousands of people can live like this and not be desperate. I understand privilege but this is something that affects every family at least.

I am completely alone, my friends are supportive in everything 100% and the reason I am still alive cause I get help from them, whether physically or mentally from afar. But they do not understand autism nor all the complex unfair realities around it. They do not understand that I cannot go to an ABA center, because I might wake up locked up with no human rights the morning after at worst, and with a life completely ruined at best. They think it's like trying a new coffee place that you can just not visit again if you don't like it, or at least they act like they think that. And while I wish it was that simple, reality is way scarier but no matter how much I explain it no one truly gets it. I don't know any other autistic people here so on this regard I am completely alone. And I don't know what to do. I don't know how I can live.

While in social services care I had therapy. I'm still seeing one of these therapists. First time round it didn't go so well, I actually even had a whole team of people. A social worker, the therapist, even a tutor (closest I ever got to a support worker). But as always the incompetence made it an inadequate service that made me feel worse and only prevented me from being able to do things, instead of helping. When I met with the therapist again just us, we both decided to give it a second try, at that point I had been completely alone for the the first time since entering the system and after trying a few private therapists I was desperate for any crumbs so I agreed to go back. It seemed to be going better but I guess I should have trusted my initial instincts...

I had ""episodes"" including pretty bad shutdowns that I hadn't had since I was a kid. So bad I almost ended up in hospital because of it. I trusted that I could open up and explain autism to this therapist as she presented pretty open minded, but every single time it was a slew of ""that can't be true!, I dont believe it"", ""I strongly don't agree with this"", ""it's a very strong position I think you're exaggerating"", ""no one is trying to do any harm to autistics, everyone just wants to help you including scientists"", ""where did you get this information from, did you make it up"" and many others, every time I tried to educate a clearly ignorant person on very real and very important realities that we face every day. But no matter how many facts I presented, there was always a reason to dismiss and not believe and excuse etc. I do not know how to have interactions with other humans, I grew up neglected, every interaction I had since I was born was traumatic, I do not know how to regulate emotions or feelings, being forced to discuss my human rights like this and the realisation that this is the only person I can talk to makes me want to die every time. Being scoffed at for not acting allistic or not meeting expectations only proves opposite of what she claims to be. Everytime I explain something she says she understands but then acts completely opposite or forgets having discussed it. Only starts treating me humanely when I've gone over my limits and I'm close to needing medical intervention, the everytime it's the same all over again. Almost as if she thinks I can turn the autism on and off, as if I don't need the same amount of patience, understanding and care at all times and not only when she has brought me over the edge, an edge that I very much not want to be near let alone pass. And yet everytime I have to go there fearing this time it's not going to be a shutdown but a meltdown and I'll hurt someone so bad I'll get arrested or killed (yes this also almost happened but it had nothing to do with this it was another time another context other people). Even my friends who do not understand autism are shocked and say I cannot be involved with people like this. They do not understand there is no one else. She is actually the best person I have ever met my whole life. I am lucky even to have her. If that's not saying everything you need to know to understand why I'm desperate...

I do not want to go back to feeling sick and being traumatised every day. I cannot survive like that, I can't even survive without all that, let alone with the additional struggles resurfacing after being relatively ok mentally wise for years. I cannot stop going, I know I would fall down the depression rabbit hole again, god knows what I'd do to myself, but going there means potentially regressing and erasing 10 years of progress that I barely survived the first time. This time around I wouldn't be so lucky, I wouldn't have the opportunities I had back then. I'm starting to feel panic and anxiety again. I had severe hospital level panick attacks for 2 years, it was the worst time of my life worse than anything, I cannot be like that again. Yesterday it happened. The therapy session was the thing that made me the sickest I have EVER been in my life. Yes it was worse than anything I had ever experienced. I was scared for my life. It is no one's fault is the worst thing. She is a good person, she doesn't know better, for some reason cannot listen. Will continue believing her opinions. I respect that even though I did not feel respected. I just don't know what to do, it's no one's fault, and no one can do anything about it...

Sorry for the long rant. I have never been this desperate my whole life. I also might be homeless soon so that also adds on to the struggles which may why I'm so stressed this time. It's 5am now I should probably stop anyway. Thank you if anyone made it to this point. Please be kind. No need for advice as there's nothing anyone can do about any of this.

1. Pa-sosyal daw yung mga taong bumibili ng vegetables, fish, beef etc. sa mall. The market is the cheapest place to buy these daw, and only those with extra budget will buy from the mall. I tried to explain that there is nothing wrong with buying from the grocery stores nor from the market. People have different priorities, and one family might think it is worth the price to buy meat kept frozen and away from flies etc. She dismisses this.

2. Pa-sosyal daw yung mga families that use serving spoons, since her family isn’t used to that 💀 . I told her there is nothing wrong sa nakasanayan ng family nya but she shouldn’t judge other families that have dining etiquettes. She got defensive and told me ako daw yung judgemental.

3. Pa-sosyal daw yung mga taong bumibili ng coffee sa Starbucks etc. She said may mura namang coffee na masarap like Nescafe 3-in-1. Mayayabang lang daw yung bumibili ng coffee na mahal tapos ang pangit pa daw ng lasa. I told her different people have different preferences. Some people will appreciate various coffees and it’s their money and their choice naman. She dismisses this.

4. Pa-sosyal daw yung mga families that ask people to spray on alcohol before passing their newborn child to be carried. This was really where we got a heated argument. She said wala daw puso yung mga taong ganyan since nakakasakit daw sabihan na mag alcohol muna bago hawakan yung baby. I told her parents will do anything to protect their children and why would she/they be offended if asked to do so? Diseases are rampant, we just got past covid, why is she still questioning other parents’ concern about the spread of viruses and bacteria? She said naging nanay naman din daw sya, okay naman daw kami ng kapatid ko. Yeah but yours is not the only way to raise a child.

There are a lot more cases of her having this toxic behavior and I have just learned to ignore rather than argue since she never listens or try to look at it from another perspective anyway.

I don’t know if anyone will actually see this, but I have to get it out somewhere before I implode. There’s this girl who’s so far out of my league it’s laughable. I see her all the time – in UMSU, around campus, sometimes even at the gym – and it’s like she’s this gravitational force.

She’s gorgeous, but it’s not just that. It’s the way she looks so focused while she’s studying, like she’s on a mission to change the world. And then, every now and then, she’ll laugh with her friends, and it’s the most genuine, happy sound in the universe. I don’t know her name, or her major, or even what year she’s in, but I’m convinced she’s literally perfect.

I’ve tried making excuses to get close to her – pretending I was lost just to ask her for directions, standing near her in the library hoping she’d notice me, even “accidentally” bumping into her once. She just gave me a polite smile and kept going, like it was no big deal. Which, of course, to her it wasn’t. But to me? It’s the highlight of my week.

I know, I know – this sounds pathetic, right? And yeah, it’s not like I’m entitled to anything from her, or that she owes me the time of day just because I’m in my feelings. But every time I see her, it’s like this mix of pure awe and total frustration because I know it’ll never be more than that. She’s on her own path, doing her own amazing things, and I’m just… here. Existing in the same place as her and being absolutely torn up about it.

I don’t know if I’ll ever talk to her, and even if I did, what would I say? “Hi, I’ve seen you like 30 times, and you have no idea, but you’ve ruined every standard I ever had in a relationship. Want to grab coffee?” It’s a joke. She’s the sun, and I’m just some asteroid floating around, hoping for a bit of her light.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you did. I just needed to vent because this girl has me feeling things I haven’t felt in years, and I don’t know how to handle it.",21,1731041200.0,umanitoba,55,0.71,False
1gman77,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1gman77/cabin_fever_part_1/,Cabin Fever part 1,"
  I am 19 years old and I've recently moved into a cabin in the middle of the woods. Being a teenager that worked a full-time job and on top of that just graduated high school, I decided it was time to start looking for my own place. Mostly so I could have my own independence and partially because I wanted to start drinking cold beer instead of the lukewarm Pabst box under my bed. Anyways, the place I found was about an hour away from my parents and very low rent which is exactly what I was looking for. After talking to the landlord through text, me and my girlfriend decided to go check it out. The cabin ended up being on the guy's property. It just wasn't in use so he decided he was going to start renting it to folk to pay for the property tax. The cabin was probably half acre away from his house so we wouldn't be in much contact which I took as a plus. The next week we decided the deal was too good to pass up on. Both of our parents reacted very excited to the news and helped us move in.

   At this time, I think it would be important to explain the layout of this cabin. The entrance to the cabin was off of a random left turn from a county road. Without knowing there was a turn you would have just thought the road was a straight drive until you got to the next stop sign. It's about a 5 minute drive into this thickly wooded path and then there was a cabin. The only door inside of the cabin was the front door. Everything else it's just an open continuous path from room to room until you reach the spiral staircase that leads to the basement. Anyways, what I'm trying to get at is that it's very far away from anywhere else and anyone else. It's been about 2 months since we've moved in and almost every single night I hear knocking at the door. My girlfriend rarely hears it which is crazy to me because the knocking has been driving me insane ever since we moved here. It's gotten so bad that I suggested we get a cat just so I can use the cat as an excuse for the weird noises I hear (which we ended up doing, my girlfriend has no idea that's why I wanted one) . After weeks of trying to convince my girlfriend that the knocking I was hearing wasn't just in my head. She finally took my side and we decided to tell the landlord to see if he had any solutions or answers. We drove down to his house and knocked on his front door. We explained the situation and he told us that 

“there was nothing in those damn woods and you kids need to stop watching horror movies. Unless you're coming here to give me the rent I suggest you leave my porch and don't come back with any of those silly ideas, you understand?””

Then he slammed the door.

Taken aback by the tone he was projecting, I went to go knock on the door again for an explanation of his behavior. As soon as I lifted my arm, my girlfriend stopped me, and told me it was obvious he wasn't in the mood for talking, and convinced me to drive us back. I feel like I was justified in being mad or at least entitled to an apology. I guess I was the only one that felt like that. Ever since that moment something felt off to me about the landlord. What in Sam Hill did I do to piss off this guy so badly and what kind of answer is “there's nothing in those damn woods.” I have no idea. All I did know is that it sure as hell felt like there was something in those woods and I'm the only person who's hearing, let alone acknowledging the damn thing.

   Despite being stressed out all the time because of this knocking situation, I managed to still get good sleep and maintain my job. Which is a blessing. Sometimes I feel like my job is the only way I can escape the constant knocking and humming I hear all day. Like I said earlier, I live an hour away from my job so closing on Fridays is always the worst. I don't get out until at least 12:30 and by that time all the fog that dissipates in the early morning starts to form on my hour drive home. The worst part about the drive home is that it's a single straight road with no turns or deviations, except for that one time there was a bomb threat. Besides that, it is a single straight shot state road that leads almost directly to my house until you have to turn to go into the woods. I wish there was some sort of left or right turn so I could make it a landmark on my late night drives. Instead, the road leads directly through a seemingly endless wall of cornfield. Not an unusual sight living in the Midwest, but I'll tell you after a 10-hour shift the Sea of Corn is mesmerizing in the worst way. The only switching of scenery is a single gas station run by some Indian family that's open 24 hours.

  At some point in the past week or maybe two I'm not quite sure, I've been getting home without remembering any part of my drive. Usually when I'm driving home I listen to a podcast or some music, maybe an episode of South Park (I know it's ridiculous and distracted driving but mind your own business.) but I don't remember doing any of that. I look through my Spotify no recent music has been queued up or played, none of the new episodes on my podcast were listen to, and I sure as hell don't remember what episode if any I was watching of South Park. After I realized this the next time I worked I was going to make sure I focused on what was going on. My fear is that I've started to sleep drive. 

  Sleepwalking has always been a problem for me. I was told that when I was a little kid living with my grandparents I was a big sleepwalker. I remember them putting extra locks on the door so I wouldn't get out but I would always find a way. I remember them telling me whenever they would check up on me at night and I wasn't on the couch I was probably out by the pond. For whatever reason 8-year-old me would walk out of the house, close the door and walk down to my grandparents pond. I never remembered this because I was obviously asleep. They would always bring it up at dinner whenever my mother came over to visit. I would always get embarrassed. I don't know why this feeling came over me. I just knew I was doing something wrong but I didn't know what. Apparently I never grew out of the whole sleepwalking thing. It's definitely tamed down. Now I just turn on the light, turn it back off and go to bed according to my girlfriend. The idea of being in that state while driving terrified me. Anyways the next day came, the shift ended and it was time for my drive home. I turned on my ignition and I woke up at the gas station. 

  Realizing that I'm 30 minutes into my drive and I don't even remember leaving the parking lot I start panicking. How the hell did I get here? Deciding I definitely needed a coffee and a splash of water in my face I took the keys out, shut my door and went inside. I got myself a 99 cent cup of coffee with one sugar and no creamer. I grabbed a Payday because it's the best candy bar of all time. I went up to the counter and nobody was there. Literally no one was inside the entire gas station. The office was right next to the entrance so I peeked over and the door was wide open, the computer unlocked with the seat completely empty. Realistically they were probably having a smoke break somewhere around the building but me being already on edge this definitely did not help. I just placed a $5 bill on the counter and walked out to my car. I mean I already poured the coffee. What else was I going to do? I threw the coffee down the hatch and the payday followed quickly after. After calming myself and letting the payday settle I continued on my drive and half an hour later I was home.
 
  I came to the conclusion that I was definitely sleep driving and needed to find a way to prevent this from happening. The next day I decided to bring an energy drink to work and crack it an hour before my shift ended. My hope was that I would be wired enough that I couldn't fall asleep. I clocked out and went to my car determined to not fall asleep this time. I put on Highway 61 revisited and left for the road. The energy drink plus a relatively slow day at work had me rejuvenated for most of the drive. Everything was going fine until about 45 minutes in, the album looped to the first song and then I saw a deer. After seeing its eyes reflect back to me I remembered to turn on my brights. My headlights lit up the infinite road ahead of me, the deer caught my attention again. The deer was eating some sort of roadkill. Its face was covered in blood with patches of fur hanging out of its mouth. For some reason, I slammed my brakes not sure if it was instinctively or if subconsciously I just wanted to get a better look. The second my brakes squealed against the road, the deer picked up its food and ran into the woods. I had no idea what to make of this. I could have sworn deer were herbivores or whatever the hell they're called. I mean, I guess I could have been wrong but something about that made me uneasy. Not knowing what else to do, I started up my car and started driving.

  The fear I swallowed in that moment must have made it to my gut. I was sick to my stomach the whole drive home. The second I got inside, I hit my mattress hoping that I would forget it the next day. I didn't. I felt like I was going insane if I decided to stay awake for my drive, I was in fear of what the road would show me. If I did fall asleep, the fate of me and the other drivers was determined on my muscle memory alone. I felt trapped. I couldn't stand being in that crazy house of a cabin where the knocking took over my surround sound. My only escape being an end of shift horror show I either couldn't or wish I couldn't remember. It was driving me mad. The fear consumed everything in my life. I couldn't go a second without wondering about the knocking. I told my girlfriend that the next night I worked, I was going to stay at my parents house because there was supposed to be fog that night and I didn't feel comfortable driving. Which was a total lie, but if I saw one more thing out of place, I was going to snap. My parents only lived 5 minutes away from my job, so making it there compared to my regular drive was nothing. My parents had a guest bedroom set up, cooked me some dinner and I went to bed. The next day I woke up at the cabin. My car wasn't in the driveway but at least the knocking stopped.

  My boyfriend has gone missing. This is the entirety of the journal he left on the kitchen table. Ever since we moved into the cabin, my boyfriend has been sleepwalking and I'm worried that last night he left the house. I'm posting this on here searching for suggestions or honestly anything. I'm not sure what to do, our living situation is illegal. For that reason, I don't want to call the cops yet I'll be posting my side of the story soon. Jacob if you end up finding this before I find you just come back, we can deal with this together. Me and Norman miss you. I was just scared. I love you.

The coffee at *Cafe Oasis* is always incredible. It wasn’t too bitter, and it wasn’t too sweet. It was just right. I took another sip and turned to look at my friend, Yuki. He was also smiling ear to ear and staring at his coffee dreamily.

“I’m sleepy,” he said.

“Me too.” I said, yawning.

We woke up at five in the morning to go see the rocket launch. There were still two hours before the launch so we decided to go drink coffee to wake up. There were plenty of other people in the cafe, but they might as well have gone to a sleepover. People were sleepwalking and some were even snoring on the floor.

“Are you excited to see the launch?” I asked.

“Yep! I’ve always wanted to see a real life rocket before.” Yuki’s eyes glittered with excitement (still a bit sleepy though).

“I wonder how big it will actually be–” BANG! Yuki was cut off by a huge crash from the door of the cafe.

Three gigantic grizzly bears wearing tailored suits walked stiffly across the cafe. Their muscles were so bulging that their suit seemed to rip at any moment. They had ear devices with the wire curling. What was most disturbing, was that there was a bulge in each of the grizzly bears’ suits: guns. 

By then, everyone in the cafe was wide awake, including me. The bears knocked the door off the hinges and were shoving people out of the way. They didn’t have to shove that many though, everyone backed off; some were even trying to find a place to hide.

“Where’s the penguin Yuki?” One of the grizzly bears yelled in his deep voice that shook the whole room. 

The temperature seemed to drop by a hundred degrees from his demanding voice and cold glare. No one dared to say a word. Everyone held their breath, darting their eyes to search for Yuki.

I looked over to my friend and found him shaking underneath the table. His eyes widened with absolute fear and he caught my gaze. He put a finger to his lips: don’t get involved is what he meant. I nodded and realized that was a mistake. One of the grizzly bears saw me nodding.	“Why did you nod at the table you twerp?” He asked in a menacing tone that made the hair on my back stand up.

“I thought there was something on my chin so I wanted to wipe it off without using my hands.” Even to me, this sounded ridiculous. I always sucked at lying. I felt my face heat up and heard some people laugh.

The grizzly bear who called me a “twerp” snickered at me and said, “People don’t usually wipe something off their chin by nodding, unless they were trying to nod.”

He glared at me and kicked the table Yuki was hiding under. The table sailed across the room and shattered a window. Yuki was shaking uncontrollably and his eyes were bigger than I ever saw. He looked at me with fear and he slowly stood up.

“Is your name Yuki?” The grizzly bear who’s been silent finally spoke in a threatening voice.

“Uhhh…umm…yes.” He fidgeted with his fingers rapidly and swayed side to side.

The bear that yelled when he entered stood behind Yuki so suddenly he would have teleported. In one swift movement of his arm, he chopped Yuki in the back of the neck and knocked him unconscious.

As Yuki fell forward, one of the bears held a sack for him to fall into. He put Yuki’s feet in so he was upside down. They tied a knot so the sack wouldn't open.

“Well, nice meeting you.” The bear said, and the three drove off in their black Corvair.

My heart was beating rapidly and I could hardly breathe. They just kidnapped my best friend in mere seconds and I didn’t do anything. I just stood here like a duck and watched it all happen. I was mad at myself for doing such a pathetic thing and I made a decision: I was going to save Kori. Turns out, this was one of the worst decisions I have ever made.

I'll try to be sure about maintaining her privacy as much as possible.

So here's the story, I met a girl in a very distinct, unexpected and random way, that's a whole different story, but turns out, after a month of talking to her, I realised she was a wonderful person, at least in my eyes. So wonderful that if I had known her before and irl, I think I would had fallen for her way long ago. But because I just got to know her around three months ago, and haven't met her irl yet, I haven't got those feelings.
Anyways, so the thing is, we aren't committed, I don't love her as a lover, nor does she, but, we talked a lot and now I feel like I'm kinda attached to her, a bit but yes. So because of studies, she has taken a break from using mobile itself, we won't be exchanging texts with each other for quite some time. She did say if she gets a chance to use mobile because of an fam function, she will definitely text me. And if she does, that would be great for me, but I'm concerned if that might affect her studies. She told me, the very same day she would be done with the exam she's preparing for she'll be texting me without wasting any time. Who could be more better than this damn girl. wow. I feel blessed and privileged.

Now, I wish she achives what she want but what I truly fear is that if she dont make a good score. Then it might push her in sorrow and might make her feel low. And because of it, she might take wrongs steps and if she chooses isolation from everyone and everything... it haunts me. 
I wish nothing like this to happen and wish everything would be great with her. 

I do want to start talking to her again, when she will be all free from the pressure of studies and exams. Want to know more about her, want to tell her more about me. Now all I can do is wish that she would be in mood to talk to me and she texts me one fine day. If she doesn't want it, that's allright too, all on her.
Never been out with a girl for a coffee, never even hung out with a girl. But if this one agrees to hang out with a fool like me, I would love to.

Alright wish me luck guys.

1gmaf52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Thailand/comments/1gmaf52/any_thais_here_that_can_help_me_understand_thai/,Any Thais here that can help me understand Thai driving mindset?,"I have visited, worked, and lived in Thailand many times since the mid-90s. Been driving a car and riding motorbike over here since 2000. Maybe getting older, become a better, less aggressive driver, finding some zen...I don't know, but since my wife and I returned a few months ago, I'm better able to deal with the traffic games and where I used to get a bit angry, I mostly laugh it off now..Hope my newfound attitude can last.

My question is when on the motorway, why do many Thais feel the need to crawl right up on your rear bumper at all times? I'm in the fast lane and going faster than the speed limit and clearly passing slower traffic. Not good enough. They feel like they need to push you out of the way. Turn your blinker on to let them know you'll be getting out of their way just as soon as possible? Not good enough, they get even closer. See them coming up in rear while you are approaching slower vehicles and put your blinker on early to let them know you'll be getting out of their way once they reach you? That's really not good enough. You can see them visibly speed up and get right up on your bumper.

See them coming up and you get over early before they can reach you? They'll keep a slow pace.

God forbid you don't put your blinker on early while you are passing the vehicle because once you leave a one-car gap, they'll squeeze in, pass you at hyperspeed and cut your nose off.

Coming back into Bangkok and staying in the middle lane while there is no traffic...That's not good enough. Many Thais will pass and then cut sharply in front... many times slowing to your speed after getting in front.

Speaking of slowing to your speed. Some of the drivers that go out of their way to pressure you and get past you in the most aggressive way will then slow down to the point you are passing them. Then they'll pass you back and do the same thing. Then they'll get into the slow down then speed up as you are passing them then slow down cycle. At that point, it's time to stop and get a coffee. 

It's absolutely crazy. At this point, I know how to eliminate most of the frustration and I've driven over here enough that I'm very rarely surprised by any unexpected situation.

The US has some pretty aggravated and clueless drivers, but I've never done anything that got a single person annoyed enough to tailgate me. Not once. It's a daily occurrence here that happens at least a few times for every hour on the road. 

Before any Westerners get upset, our next door neighbor is a retired Army officer. He and his wife have been super nice to us. She was warning us about Thai drivers yesterday when I was taking her and my wife to a market so I shared my thoughts with her and she could only agree and say they just don't care.  

I'm just curious about the mindset.

When I was in high school I was very much able to get out of bed and make it to school on time. I didn’t miss much school. 


Now as an adult I have to wake up between 4am and 520am to be at work between 5am and 630am. I don’t do manual labor, I work for 10ish hours a day and I workout multiple times a week. And I don’t drink. 

My problem is that every morning my alarm goes off it is the hardest thing to get out of bed and fully wake up. 

It’s borderline painful. I’ve called off work just to sleep all day. 

Once I get up and am at awake and go to work everything is great and I feel great.  

I go to bed around 9 and get 7-8 hours of what it feels like is good sleep. 

It’s affecting my work life now and I don’t know what to do or where to start. 

I get 7-8 hrs. 
I don’t drink. 
I exercise. 
I eat healthy 
My sleep hygiene is borderline perfect. 

I just CANT seem to get enough sleep it seems. 

Lately around 1:30-2pm I’ve been falling asleep at my desk or I’ll wait until 3 o’clock when I should leave work and take a 30 minute nap sitting up in my chair at work. (I have my own office.) 

I only have two cups of coffee in the morning but sometimes when I get sleepy in the afternoon I’ll drink a cup or two and I stilll basically pass out at my desk. ",1,1731039914.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

For the second date we had some ice cream/coffee and chatted and then we went to a movie theater where the seats are sort of a reclining sofa so we were cuddling and her head was on my chest and such, she placed her arm on my leg and such. 

After the movies we went to have some Tacos for dinner and here comes the parts that I want to bring here for discussion and would like to hear your thoughts on this.

1. On the way walking to the Taco stand, she asked me if I lived alone (here in Mexico not necessarily every male has moved from their parents house if you’re single). I said I did. 
2. She asked if I had to wake up early the following morning for work. I said I did, had a meeting at 7:30 so I had to be up really early. 
3. When we were done with dinner, on the way back while walking she said “thanks a lot of for the movie and dinner” while turning her head to me and proceeded to kiss me which I returned so we kissed and we were holding hands.
4. When we were at my car I continued to french kiss while grabbing her neck her maybe for a minute and then said “we’ll continue after I come back my trip” (because I have a trip this weekend and weekends are the only time we can see each other since she’s in Med School) then proceeded to drive her to her home. 

It was already 11pm so really I was just thinking of going to sleep. At the same time I wasn’t exactly sure if she wanted to have sex and didn’t want to disrespect her  or wanted her to feel like I was rushing it (she’s an ex Jehova witness and left her house and religion at 21 so I don’t think she started sex life at earlier ages as most people so I kind of was thinking she’s not the type to have sex that fast). But the following days I couldn’t help to think maybe she wanted me to invite her to come to my apartment. 

I just read a thread in this sub where a guy missed the sign that a girl wanted him to make a move and he didn’t and after that she lost interest. 

In my case she has not shown any loss of interest, in fact texting and engagement has increased. However, for my trip this weekend I was originally flying since friday but my flight changed to saturday so I suggested we watch a movie at my apartment (that’s a plan that was discussed during the date) but she said she has to study all weekend for her exams, which is true, but I can’t help to think that what if she kind of lost respect for me in the sense of maybe not seeing me anymore as the type she’d sleep with. 

I’ve had dates before where I take the girl to bed in the 2nd date because I take initiative and don’t give af about the outcome but this time I felt like I was too careful because I didn’t want to mess it up. 

Did she 100% wanted to have sex and I missed the hint? Would that be something that would make her lose respect for me?",0,1731039740.0,Bumble,1,0.5,False

What i meanbythis is i will nevermake you feel humiliated, especiallyin public. But you know you love the threat of unkown. That rush of givingme complete control.... I want to find a Sub who is willing to bargain money for my permission to go to the toilet. Or to watch me go to the toilet and wet and pee in places I'm shouldn't.

This could be us on video call together or exchanging messages and vids. Even better, we could meet up in person. 
Eventually the Sub starts to feel their bladder tingle and they tell me and I barely acknowledge them. Little jerking movements start and they start to grow antsy. I tell them to be still like a good boy/girl. The hold progresses and they know that they need to move. They beg me to let them go to the toilet but I just keep making excuses and saying no. Finally it's to the point they're going to wet themselves if they don't move to the toilet. They start offering me ways they can please me if I let them go. I say the only way they can get permission from me is by paying my Toilet Fee... We start bartering back and forth. They say 10$ and I smirk and say 50$ just to start walking and more if they want to make it into the bathroom. Imagine me settling for $$ and letting you go into the bathroom but making you stand in front of the toilet still squirming because you've paid to go into the bathroom. You haven't paid to open your pants, remove your underwear, or release your piss. I laugh while you're so desperate you can't think straight. Give me more $$ or you'll wet yourself. Everyone will see your wet pants and red face as you head back to the exit. You'll have to walk past so many strangers, all looking at you're soaked pants. Or you can give me what I want.

I looked on Amazon and they have these insert for cars without adjustability but it’s $25 per.   It’s a complete shit show just to have coffee with you in the car.   

Has anyone found a mug that slots in there perfectly that isn’t made by some trendy company that rapes you to have their product?  I’m thinking of just putting some high density foam DIY and call it a day.

Or the trader Joe's brand. I am picky. Anyways, I bought some Chobani yogurt cups (with fruit on the bottom) because the store was out of Fage and I love the Chobani coffee creamers, and trusted them to have good yogurt.

I was mistaken. This chobani yogurt is nasty. It has a foul aftertaste. It is not expired. I got multiple packs, and they are not expired, or texturally off, or anything. They just taste bad. I usually bring a yogurt cup to work or eat it for breakfast, but I can't stomach the taste of these. I tried to make smoothies with them, but the smoothie doesn't hide the taste. I made Greek yogurt cake, and that was okay, but I don't really need more cake in the house. I have 5 more little cups of this yogurt. 

So my question is, what can I make with this yogurt that a) is not cake and b) has enough ingredients/cooking going on to hide the gross taste? ",2,1731039377.0,Cooking,2,1.0,False
1gma46u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1gma46u/is_this_sexual_harassment/,Is this sexual harassment? ,"Tl/DR: My boss tried to approach me, when I was his employee, since day one in the interview. I'm not sure if his actions qualify for sexual harassment, hence the detailed rant..

I quit. But eventually met him again.

He's still interested, but only on bringing me back to his home and kissing me, on my cheeks, for a starter.

I'm confused. I needed to hear similar stories to evaluate the situation :) 

The long version. 

First interview, he asked if I was somehow engaged or have someone in my life. I laughed nervously, so did he. Then he brushed it off saying it's for the paper works and he needs to know if my situation is changing soon. 

Next round, he's like: I have only one comment.. You don't seem flexible. I didn't know where to put this remark.. 

First few days in work, he's extremely engaging and sweet. Casual baby talk. Like you sound tired.. Are you Okey? (I would be working from home, while laying on my sofa.. He would immediately catch my somehow different voice. Never did it again. I sit straight and watch my voice tone when he's kn the call). Or he would be like: are you sleepy? Are you going to sleep?.. With very very rugged and suggestive voice. It would be hard for me to remain collected and hang up without making my nervousness too obvious. 

Then he eventually calls me late at night. For some urgent work. We do it together. I'm as leveled and professional, nonchalant, as I can be. He texts me, next day: are you engaged? I like you. If you ever knew what I really want /need from you, you would block me. Or get angry.. Then somehow he brushes it off again, like he didn't mean it or he got confused..

Few days later. He calls. He's serious now. He's talking about an engagement perspective, and lays down his childhood, young adult life stories and family situation. And love / marriage history. He's not too curious about my life, or my preferences.. It was a him him him kind of lengthy call. 

I listened. Was very moved by the difficult episodes. I can be quite empathic. But having had dealt with harassment before this time, somehow I suspected this wasn't a genuine declaration of interest. 

It was just the usual ""I wanna get married"" episode that comes after a colleague / boss tries to seduce you into a relationship and you turn him down or act uninterested. They need to come up with the marriage excuse so it's not obvious that he wanted something else.. If his attempts are ever discovered or I happen to talk about this to someone else.. 

So. I was careful. I hang up. Saying few words like.. I'm flattered, thank you, let's take our time. Too soon for anything serious for now. Etc. 

Next day he's acting like nothing happened or was discussed. Ever. Next few weeks too. 

But he brings it up some day, again. Like.. Are you interested? And I back off, again. But this time, for a different reason. 

For one reason, I'm working with him. He's my boss. He has power over my career and position. So it felt so wrong.. I never did this in a working place. 

Second reason, I'm getting to know him and he's proving to be the most erratic, unpredictable, explosif and agressive person I ever worked with. It went into a fight or flight / freeze mode very quickly. And wasn't so sure that I want to have anything intimate with him. 

So.. We meet for the first time. After months of remote work. And.. He acts like he said nothing. Suggested nothing. Asked for nothing.. He's cold, distant. I act normal and professional, too. But expect him to bring it up at some level.. He doesn't. It was weird. 

Deep down I start to suspect it's a love bombing / devaluation scenario. Which means that not complimenting my appearance, not talking about feelings when he sees me, or future plans.. Is made to shake me away from my self-confidence. It's supposed to make me question my worth, my apparence, my mistakes that I probably made and that's why he's not interested anymore.. Doubt. Etc. 

I saw it. I understood it. I smiled. And I kept doing my work, as if nothing happened. 

But I'm sure that his techniques worked on other girls. Several other girls. I can see it in his love history. He has lots of victims. Somehow, he portrays himself as a victim, but he clearly loses nothing. It's the girls that are being used and discarded by him. Again and again. 

So.. I don't know what he has in mind, really, at this level. Probably he understood from my demeanor that I'm not interested, really. So he's taking away several advantages he once had given me. 

The title, power, respect, presence, he took it all. And he made me the ultimate scapegoat of the team. Suddenly I can't say / do anything right. He's constantly negative and demeaning. Never smiles. Never satisfied. It made me back off, slowly, until I eventually quit the job. 

It's not over. I start over a in a new job. Still not stable enough. But we're working in close regions. 

Meanwhile, I try to talk to him, make sure we're really ending in good terms and that I can have good references. He asks: did you miss me? And I eventually say ""yes. It's not like me at all, but yes.""

An attempt to ease his ego and make the rejection less painful for him. I also pretended that what drove me out lf the job wasn't his attitude but external factors. 

Final episode. A coincidence. I meet him. 

He's very happy, engaging, sweet, again. I'm my usual nonchalant cold, but polite and smiling. Inviting. 

We grab a coffee. He proposes again. Why don't we try to make it work out? We may get married.. If you have feelings for me.

I was like.. I'm not sure. You'll get bored, quickly. I'm not an interesting girl. And I bring the discussion back to our work situation and stuff.. I can tell he's not happy. He asks if I want to go. Yes. Let's go home. 

He's looking at me, in the car. I'm silent. I'm thinking. I don't trust him. I don't trust he's about marriage at all. It's just a carrot he's dangling to chase girls. It's easy to verify. 

I asked if he's willing to talk to my family members about us trying to get to know each other.. And he came up with an excuse not to do it. He wants to keep this secret. In my culture, this is very bad sign. 

He asks if I want to go home with him. I smile. ""Say that again, and I'm stepping out of this car, in the middle of the traffic.."" 

I think that me, accepting the ride home, gave him some hope? 

I'm ready to step out. He asks for a kiss. On my cheeks, eventually.. I already refused the first time he asked. This is a second. And my answer didn't change. 

It's a no. Somehow I knew one the kisses would land on my lips. Even with him simply standing by my side, I could feel his body's hit. I knew exactly what he wanted, and I knew it was just a passing secret adventure that he's aiming for. 

So. No. Even if he's not my boss anymore, and there is no power game.

He tries to attract me back to his company, though. With lots of fancy promises. And I smiled again. 

Why are you offering me all of this? :) life have taught me that nothing is ever free. 

He smiles. Doesn't deny it. 

Now the other side of the story.. The part that's confusing me. Is this sexual harassment? 

I mean.. He did back off each time I said no. Yet kept coming back again. I also wasn't totally against it, I just wanted this to be official and ""clean"". No games. And lastly, I did accept the coffee, the ride.. And kept talking with him as if everything else he's suggesting is just a bad joke that I'm dismissing with a smile. Taking the interest for a sweet compliment, nothing else. 

So.. What now?

I also like him. He's an attractive very rich young man. In Fifty shades Christian Grey fashion. So I would be lying of I say he's not attractive to me. 

I just stick to professional boundaries, and was offended by his misplaced advancements and bullying when I was working for him. Abuse of power. 

I also didn't like how he constantly checks for my feelings.. Like.. He wants to hear that I'm in love with him. I'd just smile and go. But my still being around, still thinking about this, the confusion, and asking him to get more serious.. Well.. He knows I'm not against the whole idea. 

I just feel humiliated that he's considering it solely as a side secret story, like I'm a cheap girl or something. 

So it's a polite no. Even if his image invades my imagination ever so often, after each encounter. He's wrecking my hormones. And I'm not experienced enough to even put a name on what I'm feeling..

What are your thoughts on this? Any relevant similar experiences would be very helpful.. Thank you. ",0,1731039374.0,UKJobs,7,0.43,False

I told the worker I was allergic to onions, and asked if the burritos had them, to which she specifically told me she didn’t know about one kind, but was sure the other kind did not have them. 

Alas, halfway through the burrito i noticed that there were indeed onions, and a bit less than an hour later i started vomiting, and here i am now still feeling horrible and covered in hives. If urgent care was open I’d go get seen so i could maybe have a lawsuit, im sick of people not taking allergens seriously even when i specifically point them out. As much as im glad that it’s not more serious, i almost wish my allergies kicked in instantly vs like 20 mins later just so they would realize how serious it is - i don’t go into anaphylaxis now but the more i trigger it the more likely that becomes. I feel like im being a drama queen but this kind of negligence gets people killed.",29,1731039334.0,ChronicIllness,12,0.9,False
