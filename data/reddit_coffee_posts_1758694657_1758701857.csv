1np6fsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1np6fsg/is_it_a_slow_burn_or_is_he_not_interested/,Is it a slow burn or is he not interested?,"I have been seeing a guy we’ve been talking for a month and have gone out 3 times. We’re both mid-twenties.

The first time we got coffee, went for a walk then went back to mine and played some video games.

The second time he came over after work and we went out for dinner then relaxed and watched some TV after.

The third time we did something a bit unusual and went for a sauna as we both live pretty active lifestyles and enjoy the health benefits of a sauna, we then relaxed at my place after.

At the end of the first time we hung out he hugged me. The second time we hung out I thought maybe he would kiss me but the night also ended in a hug, but this hug was tighter than the last one. The third time I thought for sure he would kiss me, I gave him the look but he went in for a hug again this one even tighter than the last, like he was squeezing me really hard.

Other than hugs there has only been a few instances of physical contact. One was while I was on the floor trying to crack my back and he put one hand on my arm and the other on my thigh closer to my knee trying to help. The other time he was on the floor with his feet on the couch and I was on the couch, he went to sit up and didn’t make it so I extended my hand and held him there so he could have some water, after he jokingly went to pull me over when he went to lay back down. Shortly after I relaxed and extended my legs and when mine touched his it was an instant game of footsies turned leg strength competition then he put my leg in a hold between his for a minute before letting go.

Not a day has gone by since we connected where I haven’t heard from him. He wishes me a good morning or good night, he tells me to drive safe everytime he knows I’m heading somewhere. We even chat throughout the day. We do use Snapchat as our main form of communication & we have the “bff” emoji. As childish as it sounds, it makes me think that I might be the only girl he is talking to and I’m not part of some “roster”.

We don’t overly give compliments to each other, he’s told me I’m pretty and called me gorgeous before and I call him handsome every now and then.He does send the odd video of him flexing his muscles and I just give respectful compliments as I don’t want to sexualize him since he never sexualizes me.

He drives 40 minutes or more depending on traffic or where he’s leaving from to come to my side of town to see me.

This might be a reach but a few hours before the second “date” he put a song on his Instagram notes that had some lyrics along the lines of “I like who I am when I’m with you”. I thought it might’ve been directed at me or about me. (Maybe I’m delusional here)

I did ask his intentions after the first meeting and he said he wants to get to know me and let things develop. However, I am used to being love-bombed and lusted over in all the other connections I’ve had over the last year & a half after leaving a long-term relationship (which also moved fast). So this connection has me over-thinking and questioning everything.

I’m so used to guys sexualizing me off the hop or making moves so quickly that I have it in my head that he must not like me if he’s not making any advances or saying anything sexual towards me.

So is he actually into me and this is some sort of slow burn? Do I just be patient & wait for him to make a move?

Any advice is highly appreciated

TL;DR: guy I’ve been seeing wants to get to know me & let things develop but I’m so used to things moving fast that I’m worried he’s not actually interested because he hasn’t kissed me after 3 “dates”.",3,1758701234.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

I had a steady job, friends, family - on the outside it looked fine. But inside I was falling apart, and by the time I admitted it, things were already bad. It's weird how fast it sneaks up on you until suddenly your whole life revolves around the next drink or pill.

What pushed me to finally get help was one night sitting in my car outside my own house, not wanting to go inside because I didn't want anyone to see me like that. That was the moment I knew I had run out of excuses. A few days later, I walked into Shore Point Recovery in Boston. I won't lie, the first days were brutal - detox felt endless, and facing everything I'd been avoiding for years was even harder.

The part that stuck with me wasn't just the therapy or the medical side, though. It was the way they made it feel like I had a shot at actually living again, not just surviving. Yoga, group talks, even something as simple as sitting outside without needing a crutch, it reminded me what ""normal"" could be.

Now I'm back out in the world, and the challenge is figuring out how to keep that momentum going. Massachusetts looks different to me now. I notice the little things, like walking past Fenway and not needing a buzz to enjoy it, or grabbing coffee and actually tasting it instead of using it to cover up a hangover. It's small, but it matters.

I'm writing this because I hope someone else in Massachusetts who's stuck where I was reads it and decides to take that step. It's terrifying, yeah, but so much better than living the same day on repeat. If you're even thinking about it, please know there's a way out",18,1758700724.0,massachusetts,1,1.0,False

Originally it was in small shops marketing it as a luxury product and selling it at an inflated price maybe 4 or 5 times more expensive than UK chocolate brands.

Then it started to show up in coffee and cake shops with pistachio latte's and pistachio cream muffins and cakes.

It's even now showing up in the cheaper shops like poundland , home bargains etc.

I think there was a bumper crop of pistachios last year that left them with such an abundance that the cabal thought it would have to come up with clever ways of marketing this abroad and get rid of the excess.

Because it was marketed at a high price people started buying it a lot in the cheaper shops when it had been reduced.

It stinks of conspiracy to me. 

Is it just the UK or has the pistachio craze gone global.

Him and his friend decided to buy the apartment together and help each other out. I didn’t move in until a year later. Now my fiance did need the financial help when starting out since he didn’t have much and housing prices SUCK and the RM needed help financially too with needing to pay child support. I was ok with it too since hes usually gone for awhile so we had the place to ourselves a lot. 


4 years later my fiance and I have worked together to be able to make our place more homey(buying a sofa, dishes, diner table,ect), will be getting married soon and will want to get our own house to start a family. Him…not so much. When he’s home he mostly stays in his room all day so he doesn’t make a mess other than in his room but going into his room it seriously looks like someone who has only been out on their own for a few months. Tv is on our old coffee table, we helped him pay for his bed frame, night stand we got for free from someone who was moving out and is using our old fans. That’s all he has other than a bunch of clothes and some sports stuff like a flag and some hats. Not even a dresser he just has clean and dirty piles. The only thing he has is his car which he barely got this year and he’s behind on payments. He eats out a lot, likes to buy nice clothes and a lot of his money goes to child support and other things the child wants. Child wants 80 dollar shoes and a 60 dollar game? Child will eventually get it. He has missed a few rents because of just not being able to pay for it despite him making more money than my fiance. 


With us getting married we thought this would be his “Oh I should really be putting my life together soon”. No. My fiance brought up how we plan on moving out and having a family and his response was for us to look for a 3 bedroom house so that he can have his own bedroom. What? I get it that child support does take a hit on you financially but at this point he should have been able to get up on his feet and afford his own place right? 


How should we break it to him that we when we find someplace else we would like for him to find his own place? He’s never done anything bad living wise (except little nit picks like leaving lights on or leaving clothes all over bathroom floor) he’s just in a tough situation and making poor financial decisions.

I'm being bitter someone else got the job I wanted.,"Some time ago I started an internship at a software company with another girl. At first, we got along fine, helped each other out, got coffee together, whatever. But pretty quickly I noticed she spent way more time chatting with people from other teams and hanging out than actually working. Meanwhile I was grinding away on real projects, trying to prove myself because that’s how I was raised. You work hard, you earn it.

I figured fine, her problem not mine. Our work will speak for itself right? If she wants to sit on her phone or wander around socializing go for it.

Fast forward, internship ends, company announces they’ve got one open spot and they’re choosing between the two of us. Guess who got it? Spoiler, it wasn't me.

I was crushed. I loved the team and I wanted that job so badly. But I told myself it's okay, she’s more social, maybe she ""played the game"" better. Fine. I’ll move on.

Then a few months later a friend at the company tells me she’s sleeping with one of the managers and they’ve just gone public with their relationship.

So yeah. Now I’m pissed. I feel like all my hard work meant nothing and the whole thing was a setup.

Йдеться про систему автоматичного розливу кави. Достатньо поставити стакан, натиснути кнопку — і машина сама наливає фільтр-каву.

Це рішення виглядає як крок у майбутнє:
	•	швидкість і зручність обслуговування,
	•	стабільна порція,
	•	відсутність «людського фактора».

Проте виникає низка запитань:
	•	Смак і свіжість. Як довго напій може залишатися у резервуарі перед розливом? Чи зберігає він свій аромат і баланс, адже фільтр-кава має оптимальний смак лише протягом перших годин після приготування?
	•	Емоції. Чи не втрачається той самий контакт із баристою, який часто є невід’ємною частиною візиту до кав’ярні?
	•	Досвід. Чи сприймають відвідувачі таку систему як «фішку» сучасного простору, чи, навпаки, як холодну автоматизацію без душі?
	•	Майбутнє кав’ярень. Чи стане це трендом в Україні, як у деяких закладах Австралії, чи залишиться локальною експериментальною історією?

I had tried matrimony apps before but kept running into the same endless chats, no real intention and mismatched priorities. I was not looking to date casually, I was ready to find a life partner. Luckily Vip shaadi idea came into my mind. Within two weeks, my matchmaker shared great profiles. I started having proper conversations with real people. The relationship manager genuinely got what I was looking for in a partner.

The biggest relief was that I didn’t have to keep sending requests and messaging people over and over. The people I connected with had already gone through my details and said yes. This saved a lot of time. I finally met my partner too. Both of us had aligned lifestyle and future plans. We met a few times over coffee, then with families, and eventually, it just felt like the right move.

We got engaged earlier this year and are planning a wedding soon. I still think about how hard it felt before, and how once things aligned, it all came together peacefully.",1,1758699558.0,u_No-Occasion-7899,0,1.0,False

I woke up to a bunch of puke from my cat who ate something, all good, my partner helped me clean it up and we still had time to have coffee together.

I went to a workout class which was super good and then I came back home, took a long shower and got ready for work after spending a few minutes snuggling my cat.

When I am done with work at 3-4 pm I will attend online dance class in my pole dance room - yeah I have a pole room because I can use the second bedroom for that instead of a kid's room.

I will then make a nice new recipe with my boyfriend and try new food.

Then I will play some video games and continue on to binge a show with my partner while we cuddle our cat.

Life is great. I don't ever want to have kids. I am so grateful for realizing this early enough! <3

1np5xmu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1np5xmu/not_using_mht/,Not Using MHT,"Hey there.  

I am just looking to see if there are people out there who aren't using MHT and are surviving.  I think i am doing OK but, you know how it is for women and just getting on with it when it comes to hormones/menstrual cycle  

I think i start perimenopause about 5-6 years ago: mad horny, erratic periods and baaaadddddd PMDD.  

Now, 46, my cycle can be very long - gone from average 24 days to having 50 day cycles, which would be a skipped period. I sometimes have hot blooms but they come and go.  

I have put on weight but my training intensity changed over the past 5 years and I have circled back to crossfit so I might see a change there.  But, I CBA dieting and it seems to require a lot more effort than it did 7-9 years ago.  My partner thinks I am amazing and adores me which contributes to the cannae be arsed with a calorie deficit. 

My sex drive has disappeared which has unsettled my partner  - we got together at the end of the mad horny phase and I feel bad for him.  He is very understanding and there's no pressure at all.   I fancy him and I am mad in love with him but there's nothing happening ""down there"". So I have to, not force myself but I don't know the phrase I am looking for, and once we get going it's fucking fabulous as always. 

Brain fog is more like forgetting a place name, or a certain word.  I am managing to complete a diploma in a brand new career with 1 mark off a distinction as well as learning the role itself. 

Itchy skin - occasionally but eczema prone so it's not unusual; tinnitus  - can be bad at times but had that my whole life as I am deaf.

I suffered from PMDD when I was ovulating and I am really reluctant to use MHT in case it comes back. It was so bad that I wanted to un-alive myself and knowing it was hormones and not real was a monthly battle that was exhausting.    I also CBA fighting the NHS for MHT and appointments and time off work (my current site is 50 mins from home so I would be limited to appointment times). 

I like the lighter periods and longer cycles. Hot blooms are manageable and pass.  The weight gain isn't a showstopper and I could just exercise patience and discipline and acknowledge that it might take longer.  The sex drive thing is manageable thanks to an understanding partner and me being open about how I am feeling/affected by perimenopause.  From what I see, MHT doesn't necessarily work and can take time to find the right balance.  

I do have vitamin D3 to take - Scotland and sunlight in winter means it's a necessity.  I train regularly  - crossfit, running and lifting weights and I enjoy these. My nutrition is good except I love chocolate a bit too much. I rarely drink alcohol now as it affects my sleep.  I have one coffee a day. I work outside and it's not stressful.  So I am ticking all the lifestyle boxes and I am grateful to be in this position.  

My mum had an uneventful menopause transition, she said she got a bit hot at times, her cycle got longer and periods lighter to the point they just stopped.  She did have THE RAGE though but she's a wee ginge and was like that anyways haha!  Maybe I am just going through a similar journey. 

This is probably a brain dump than anything else!   ",1,1758699126.0,Perimenopause,0,1.0,False
1np5xil,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1np5xil/culture_shock_at_new_job_should_i_be_more_social/,Culture shock at new job - should I be more social?,"
Hi all, I just started a new job and I’m experiencing a bit of culture shock. The office is really really lively - people chat, socialise, and generally seem very comfortable with one another. 

In my previous job, the environment was much quieter. People generally kept to themselves and only really interacted within their immediate teams. After two years there, that style of working became second nature to me, so this shift has been quite unexpected.

So I have a few questions:
1. In a company like this, should I be actively trying to greet and make conversation with people? We hot desk, so I end up sitting next to different people quite often. I’m just not used to initiating casual chats in a professional setting.

2. This might sound stupid, but how do people usually introduce themselves in a setting like this? I’ve never worked anywhere this social before. In the past, I only ever interacted in person with people I actively worked with. we all kinda ignored everyone else.

3. What do you do in situations like this? Do you try to socialise or just keep your head down and get on with work?

4. One specific thing that’s throwing me off a bit - a particular director has made an effort to talk to me a few times during my first 3 weeks, during and has even suggested we book time for a coffee chat recently. Once again, a very stupid question, but I’m not sure how to follow up. I’m worried I’ll come off as bothering her, even though she brought it up.

1np5tp4,https://i.redd.it/4ev4u41zd2rf1.png,"Fifteen Years, Then A Photo","For fifteen years, my husband Dustin and I were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it, the tech CEO and his devoted wife. Our life was perfect.



Then a text message arrived from an unknown number. It was a picture of his assistant's hand on his thigh in the suit pants I bought him.



The texts from his mi\*\*ress kept coming after that, a relentless barrage of poison. She sent photos of them in our bed and a video of him promising to leave me. She bragged that she was pr\*\*nant with his child.



He'd come home and k\*\*s me, call me his anchor, all while smelling of her perfume. He was buying her a condo and planning their future while I pretended to have morning sickness from bad scallops.



The final straw came on my birthday. She sent a picture of him on one knee, giving her a diamond promise ring.

So I didn't cry. I secretly changed my name to Hope, converted our entire fortune into untraceable bearer bonds, and told a charity to empty our house of everything.



The next day, as he headed to the airport for a""business trip"" to Paris with her, I flew to Portugal. When he came home, he found an empty mansion, divorce papers, and our wedding rings melted into a single, shapeless lump of gold.





Chapter 1

I remembered the first time Dustin touched my ch\*\*t. We were sixteen, crammed into the back of his dad's old Ford, fogging up the windows.



He was all nervous hands and shaky breaths, fumbling with the clasp of my b\*a like he was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.



I finally had to reach back and unhook it for him. He went beet red, even in the faint moonlight, and stammered an apology.



It was funny. It was sweet.



For fifteen years, he was the only one. The boy who couldn't unhook a b\*a became the tech CEO who graced magazine covers.



To the world, we were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it. Eliana and Dustin Powell. A brand. A testament to enduring love in a fast-paced world.



Our life was perfect.



Until it wasn't.



The text message arrived on a Tuesday. An unknown number.



It was just a picture, no words.



A woman's hand, nails painted a garish shade of pink, resting on a man's thigh. The hand was slender, young. Too young.



The thigh was clad in dark gray suit pants I recognized instantly. I'd bought them for him. Tom Ford. For his thirty-second birthday.



On the woman's wrist was a delicate gold bracelet with a single, tiny shark tooth.



I felt the air leave my lungs.



That bracelet. I'd seen it before.



On the wrist of Jami Salinas, his executive assistant. She'd flashed it at the company's summer party, her smile a little too bright, her eyes lingering on me a little too long.



My heart started a frantic, painful rhythm against my ribs.



It couldn't be.



But it was.



My first impulse was to scream. To throw my phone against the wall. To call him and demand an explanation for the image burning itself into my brain.



I didn't.



I took a deep, shuddering breath and forced the rage down. I stared at the photo until the details blurred, until the sickness in my stomach became a cold, hard knot.



Was any of it real? Our fifteen years? The boy in the back of the Ford? The man who ki\*\*ed me goodbye this morning?



The next day, I drove to the county courthouse. The building was old and smelled of dust and stale coffee.



I walked to the clerk's office, my steps even and measured.



""I'd like to file a petition for a name change,"" I told the woman behind the counter.



She looked up, her glasses perched on the end of her nose. ""For what reason?"" 



""Personal reasons,"" I said, my voice flat.



She raised an eyebrow, taking in my clothes, my bag. I was Eliana Powell, wife of a billionaire. Women like me didn't just change their names.



""Are you in danger? Is this related to domestic abuse?"" 



""No,"" I said. The lie tasted like ash, but it was a necessary one. This wasn't about danger. It was about erasure. ""I just want a new name."" 



""What name did you have in mind?"" 



""Hope,"" I said, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. ""Hope Tillman."" Tillman was my mother's maiden name. A name that belonged to me, and me alone.



The clerk typed for a moment. ""And you are currently Eliana David Powell?"" 



""Eliana David,"" I corrected her. I had never taken his name. It was a point of pride once. Now, it was a convenience. ""My legal name is Eliana David."" 



""The process will take a few weeks. You'll have to post a notice, attend a hearing."" 



""I understand,"" I said. ""Please begin the process."" 



She stamped the papers with a loud thud. Each stamp felt like a nail in the coffin of my old life.



Hope. A name for a future I couldn't yet see, but one I would build for myself, brick by painful brick.



The plan formed in my mind with chilling clarity. A new name. A new passport. A new life. Far away from here. Portugal. The Algarve coast. I'd always wanted to photograph the sea caves there.



I got the new social security card first. It came in a plain white envelope. Hope Tillman. It looked like a stranger's name.



I kept my old driver's license. A reminder of the ghost I was preparing to leave behind.



That night, I saw him on TV. He was at a charity gala, looking impossibly handsome in his tuxedo.



The reporter asked him about his success. He smiled that charming, public smile.



He held up his left hand, flashing the simple gold band I'd placed on his finger a decade ago. ""My biggest success is my wife, Eliana. She's my anchor."" 



The crowd applauded. The reporter swooned.



""She's the best thing that ever happened to me."" 



I watched the screen, my face a blank mask. The words meant nothing. They were just sounds, empty air. The man on the screen was a stranger performing a role.



My anchor. He was the storm, and I was the ship he was sinking.



The next morning, I took our wedding rings to a jeweler in a town an hour away. Not a fancy place, just a small, dusty shop run by an old man with a jeweler's loupe permanently attached to his eye.



I placed my ring and Dustin's matching band on the velvet tray. ""I want them melted."" 



A sharp pain shot through my hand, as if the ring was still there, burning my skin. I clenched my fist.



""Melted?"" the old man asked, peering at the rings. ""These are fine pieces. 18-karat gold."" 



""I know what they are,"" I said. ""Melt them. Together. Into a single, shapeless lump."" 



He looked from the rings to my face, his expression unreadable. ""Are you sure, miss? This is... permanent."" 



""Yes,"" I said, my voice unwavering. ""I'm sure."" 



He shrugged and took the rings to the back. I waited, listening to the hum of the polishing wheel and the frantic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.



An hour later, he returned with a small, gray velvet box.



Inside, resting on the white satin, was a lump of gold. It was ugly. Deformed. All the perfect circles and polished shine were gone, fused into an unrecognizable mass.



It was perfect.



He came home late that night, long after I'd hidden the small box in my closet. He brought me a bouquet of white lilies, my favorite.



""For my beautiful wife,"" he said, ki\*\*ing my cheek.



He smelled of her. That same cloying, fruity perfume Jami always wore.



I didn't pull away. I just stood there, a statue in his arms.



As he moved past me into the kitchen, I saw it. A faint red mark on his neck, just above his collar. A love bite. Sloppy. Careless.



Did you have fun at your ""late meeting,"" Dustin? I wanted to ask. Did you enjoy her young, eager body in your office?



But I said nothing. The time for questions was over.



He wrapped his arms around my waist from behind, pulling me against him. ""I missed you today."" 



I felt a wave of nausea. The touch of his hands on my skin felt like a violation.



I gently pushed him away. ""I'm tired, Dustin.""





Chapter 2

""Tired?"" He sounded surprised. ""Is everything okay, Eli?"" 



""Just a long day,"" I lied, moving towards the stairs.



""Well, let me make it better,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, su\*\*estive purr. He followed me, his hand reaching for mine.



I flinched away from his touch.



He stopped, a flicker of something-annoyance? confusion?-in his eyes. ""Okay. I get it. I've been working a lot. Let's have a date night tomorrow. Just the two of us. We can go to that place you love, the one by the coast."" 



""Fine,"" I said.



He smiled, relieved. ""Great. I have a surprise for you, too."" 



""I have one for you, as well,"" I said, thinking of the gray velvet box upstairs.



His smile widened. ""Oh yeah? Is it my birthday already?"" 



The question was a bitter joke. My own birthday had been last week. He'd forgotten. Sent a text from a meeting in Tokyo.  'Happy bday, babe. Super busy. Celebrate when I'm back.' He never mentioned it again.



""No,"" I said. ""Just because."" 



He came closer, trying to k\*\*s me. I turned my head, and his lips met my cheek.



""Okay,"" he said, pulling back, looking a little hurt. ""I'll see you in the morning."" 



I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, listening to his steady breathing beside me. This was a performance now. The last act of a long-running play. And I knew my lines.



The next evening, he was all charm, holding the car door open for me, his hand on the small of my back.



He chattered the whole way to the restaurant, talking about a new deal, a difficult board member, a rival company's failure. I made the right noises, nodding and smiling in the right places.



As he pulled into the valet line, something on the passenger side floor caught my eye. A single, long, blonde hair.



Jami's hair.



I looked at it, then looked away. I didn't pick it up. I didn't point it out.



There was no point in fighting anymore. You don't argue with a ghost. And he was already a ghost to me.



The restaurant was where he'd proposed. Perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean, the waves crashing below. It was supposed to be our place.



Tonight, it would be the place where it all ended.



As we walked in, a woman at a nearby table gasped. ""Oh my God, it's Dustin Powell!"" 



He gave her a gracious nod, the tech king in his element.



He'd just called work, a ""quick emergency."" He stood a few feet away, his back to me, his voice low and urgent.



""I'm sorry, baby, I have to step out,"" he said, turning back to me, his face a mask of regret. ""Something's come up at the office. A server farm in quadrant four is down. It's a mess."" 



""Go,"" I said.



""I'll be so quick. Twenty minutes, tops. Don't you move, okay? Order us a bottle of the good stuff."" He winked.



A woman at the next table sighed dreamily. ""He's so dedicated. And so in love with his wife."" 



I knew where he was going. He wasn't talking to his head of engineering. He was talking to Jami. The ""server farm"" was her apartment. The ""emergency"" was her.



I went back to the car. I told the valet I'd forgotten my wrap.



His second phone, the one he thought I didn't know about, was in the glove compartment. It was unlocked.



The texts were right there.



Jami:  'Heard you're on a date with the old lady. Boring.'



Dustin:  'Have to keep up appearances. Be there in 10. Wear that red thing I like.'



Jami:  'Hurry up. I have a surprise for you.'



Then a photo. Jami, pouting at the camera, wearing a red lace teddy. On the nightstand behind her was a small, blue box from Tiffany's.



My stomach churned. I felt a violent, visceral need to throw up. The perfectly cooked scallops I'd just eaten threatened to make a reappearance.



He came back twenty-five minutes later, looking pleased with himself. ""All handled. See? Told you I'd be quick."" 



I forced a smile, the muscles in my face protesting.



""Are you okay?"" he asked, seeing my pale face. ""You look a little green."" 



""Just... the scallops,"" I managed to say. ""Maybe they were a bit off."" 



""That's it,"" he said, his face darkening. ""I'm going to have a word with the manager. This place has gone downhill."" 



""No, Dustin, don't,"" I said. ""It's fine."" 



He looked at me, his brow furrowed. ""You know, I was thinking about what you said. About my birthday. I know I forgot yours. I'm a j\*\*k. I'm so sorry, Eli."" 



The apology, so late, so hollow, hung in the air between us.



""I'm going to make it up to you,"" he said, his voice earnest. ""I promise."" 



I thought of the red lace teddy. The Tiffany box. The server farm in quadrant four.



I felt the vomit rise in my throat. I stumbled out of my chair and ran for the bathroom, barely making it to the stall before I was sick.





Chapter 3

I stayed in the bathroom for a long time, splashing cold water on my face, my reflection a pale, haunted stranger in the mirror.



Dustin was waiting for me, his face etched with concern. ""Are you sure you're okay? We can go home."" 



How could he be so good at this? The lies, the performance. A part of me wondered if he even knew he was doing it anymore. If the line between the loving husband and the cheating ba\*\*ard had blurred so much in his own mind that he couldn't see it.



The cool night air on the drive home cleared my head. The nausea subsided, replaced by a cold, clear calm.



""I'm feeling better,"" I said, as he pulled into the garage.



""Good,"" he said, his hand on my knee. ""Because I still have that surprise for you."" 



""Tomorrow,"" I said. ""Let's do surprises tomorrow."" 



He looked disappointed but nodded. ""Okay. Tomorrow."" 



A wicked little idea sparked in my mind. A final, parting shot.



""Actually,"" I said, turning to him. ""I've been thinking. You're right. We need more time together. Why don't you take tomorrow off? We can spend the whole day together. Here. At home."" 



He looked surprised. Then a little panicked. A whole day. A whole day he couldn't sneak away to see Jami.



""I... I don't know, Eli. I have that big presentation..."" 



""Reschedule it,"" I said, my voice sweet. ""For me."" 



He chewed his lip, cornered. ""Okay,"" he said finally, forcing a smile. ""For you. Anything."" 



We went to bed. He fell asleep almost instantly. I waited until his breathing was deep and even, then slipped out of the room.



I went to his office. His work laptop was on his desk. He used the same password for everything. Our anniversary. The irony was thick enough to choke on.



I found what I was looking for in his deleted items folder. He wasn't as smart as he thought he was.



A video. Jami, again. This time she was in his office, perched on his desk, wearing nothing but his dress shirt.



""Dustin, baby,"" she cooed, running a hand down her thigh. ""When are you going to leave her? She's so old and boring. I'm so much more fun."" 



He didn't reply, but I could hear his low chuckle off-camera.



I closed the laptop, my hands steady. The pain was a distant echo now. All I felt was a profound, bottomless disgust.



I went back to our bedroom. He'd rolled over in his sl\*\*p, one arm flung across my side of the bed, searching for me.



""Eli?"" he murmured, half-asleep.



""I'm here,"" I said, my voice a wh\*\*per.



He sighed and settled back into sl\*\*p.



In the morning, his phone started buzzing at 6 a.m. It buzzed again. And again. A relentless, insistent rhythm.



""Goddammit,"" he groaned, rolling over and grabbing it from the nightstand. ""What the h\*\*l does she want now?"" 



He got out of bed, walking into the adjoining bathroom to take the call. He thought I couldn't hear. He was wrong.



""What, Jami?"" he hissed. ""I told you I'm taking the day off... No, you can't come over... Because Eliana is here, that's why... Look, just handle it. I'll call you later."" 



He came back into the bedroom, looking annoyed. I saw him slip the phone into the pocket of his robe.



""Work?"" I asked, feigning sleepiness.



""Yeah,"" he grunted. ""St\*\*id emergency. I handled it."" 



He went downstairs. A few minutes later, the smell of coffee and bacon filled the house. He was making breakfast. A grand gesture.



He came up with a tray laden with food. Pancakes, eggs, bacon, fresh-squeezed orange juice. A feast.



""I was thinking,"" he said, setting the tray on the bed. ""You do so much around here. Maybe we should hire a housekeeper. A cook, even. Take some of the pressure off you."" 



He wanted to replace me. In every way.



""No, thank you,"" I said. ""I like taking care of our home."" My home. Not for much longer.



I picked at the food, my appetite gone.



""So,"" I said, looking at him over my coffee cup. ""Are we okay, you and I?"" 



He looked startled. ""Of course, we're okay. Why would you even ask that?"" 



""No reason,"" I said.



He reached across the tray and took my hand. His was warm and strong. It felt like a stranger's.



""Eliana,"" he said, his voice thick with sincerity. ""I love you. You know that, right? I would never, ever do anything to hurt you. You are my world."" 



I looked into his eyes, a deep, earnest blue. He was a phenomenal liar. Or maybe he believed it himself.



""I would die before I betrayed you,"" he said.



I almost laughed.



""Good to know,"" I said, pulling my hand away. I stood up and walked to the closet. ""I'm going to get dressed."" 



He looked relieved, the conversation over.



As I was pulling on a sweater, I asked, casually, ""So, where did you put my birthday gift?"" 



He froze. ""Your... gift?"" 



""From last week,"" I said, turning to face him. ""You said you had one for me."" 



He was a deer in the headlights. He had nothing. He'd completely forgotten.

Emily Martin woke up to find she had been reborn at the age of twenty-five. 

She remembered that in her previous life, she had married William Kenney-a CEO of a Washington-based company-and later lived with her mother in his home. 

Relatives envied her, saying she’d hit the jackpot with William-a blessing beyond measure. 

But only she knew how miserable her life had been ever since. 

At forty-five in her previous life, she suffered from severe depression. William left her alone at home. In the end, she locked herself in the kitchen and turned on the gas, ending her life. 

All these were caused by a woman-William’s cherished one. 

Emily furrowed her brows, knowing that woman would seek her out today. She’d prepared divorce papers in advance. 

This was the Cafe William frequented-a place etched in her memory forever. 

In her past life, it was here that he often met his lover in secret. 

She hadn’t found out the truth until she followed him here one day. 

When she demanded answers, he slapped her and coldly said: “What happens between us is none of your concern. 

That day, she crouched in a corner near the Cafe and wept for a long time. 

She’d been twenty-five then too. 

Now, clarity struck Emily. 

She had wasted her devotion on someone who didn’t deserve it-she had loved the wrong 

person for so many years. 

Until death, William never truly looked at her

Frowning, she gripped the Cafe doorknob and turned it. 

A soothing coffee fragrance enveloped her as she spotted Sophia Lee in the corner. 

Sophia sat opposite her, expression icy and detached. “The one William loves is me. Give up and stop clinging to him.” 

Emily slid the divorce papers across the table. “I’ll step aside if you get him to sign this. 

Once he signed and the waiting period is over, I’ll leave immediately.” 

Sophia’s eyes widened in surprise at her swift agreement-so swift she’d give up the title of Mrs. Kennedy. 

Emily met her gaze scoffeedily, adding, “Since he’s always wanted you, I’ll yield. 

Just make sure he signs the papers. After that, whatever happens between you two has nothing to do with me.” 

She took a sip of water. 

This time, she would never again be that naive “Mrs. Kennedy” who was kept in the dark and deceived by everyone. 

Sophia’s fingers tightened around her cup, glaring. “Emily, what’s your game?” 

“No games. Just tired.” 

Emily held her stare, unflinching and at peace. 

Without another word, she rose to leave. 

The Cafe was bustling with people, but to her, it all felt like noise. 

Reading Emily’s resolve, Sophia’s guard lowered. She called after the retreating figure: 

“You’re handing William to me! Once I’m Mrs. Kennedy, don’t expect me to return him. 

Emily walked on without pausing. 

Sophia followed her out, swiping her phone to dial William. 

He answered unusually fast. 

“William, can you pick me up now?

Emily stood just one traffic light away from her, a bitter smile tugging at her lips. 

She remembered in her previous life, none of her calls to William were ever answered. 

But now, barely moments after the red light switched, the man himself appeared at the entrance of the Cafe. 

Emily turned to see him leaning against the glass window in a tailored black suit. 

His frame stood tall and straight, broad-shouldered with a narrow waist. 

He handed Sophia the cake he carried, bending close to whisper he’d asked his chef for extra 

blueberries-her favorite. 

Despite herself, Emily’s heart twisted painfully. ",1,1758698665.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

I have a good life and good people in my life but I'm the one sabotaging everything. I self distract, putting myself in danger and a mess that I know will eat me alive.
Hi! My name is Jane, 25. I have a wonderful boyfriend who works hard so we can built a life together in the near future. He is away and most of the time, I am alone. I met this guy, 27, George. He is handsome and he knows it. He knows it and he definitely uses it for his advantage. We met in an auction and I was the representative of the company I work with and he was the secretary of the piece my boss bought. We've met several times already but never really mingled with each other, one time, my friend, Sarah was talking to me about my plans of becoming an independent artist after rendering from my current company, George passes by and takes a quick glance. I did not bother and continued talking to Sarah anyway. After the talk, I went to the powder room when I was blocked by George on the way. He stopped and asked me, so you're resigning? And I told him yes. Then he started talking to me how it would be a loss for the company if I leave. After that, he started messaging me but its mostly work query so nothing really is sus at that time. We instantly clicked as we tend to agree on almost anything and I thought that was a start of a good friendship, oh boy, was I wrong. One time, I was alone in the art gallery fixing some pieces for the next collection event, when he entered then helped me. He was sweet talking and I admit I was slowly being swept but I tried my best to not cave in. He kept on complimenting my features and intellect and I started thinking, He must be flirting with me. During that time, I was single but I was in constant communication with a very close friend who later on became my boyfriend. Anyway going back, Idk how it happened but a tension was slowly building up between me and George to a point where he leaned to kiss me but I moved away. Then I told him, we are in a professional setting and perhaps he should go. He went out but still messages me and he told me he's sorry, I told him it was fine and the next day he came again! but this time, I caved. He kissed me and I kissed back. After that we had several encounters until I finally was gone for good. Don't get me wrong he did not get undet my pants, but oh well still. Few months passed and I thought I forgot about him, when all of a sudden, we crossed paths again, then that night we started talking again. We talked so I thought this might go into something deeper and meaningful, again I was wrong, very much wrong. Moving on, despite separating from the company, I was able to keep my communication with Sarah, my workmate and friend. She did not know anything about me and George, no clue but how funny I find it that the 1st topic she told me was about George. She said, George is quite mysterious and aloof, but did you know that he was in a long term relationship? We saw them together in a club all chummy and hot for each other so we stalked their socials, George's private however we found the girl and she's too proud where most of her content was about George. Who can blame her, He's George the Gorg! 
After hearing it, I suddenly felt numb and I feel like my blood is about to burst. I did not say a word and changed the topic. I never confronted George and ghosted him. 
A year has passed and I now got myself a boyfriend, He was perfect not literally but he got the looks, personality, vibe and everything that I wanted for a partner. I was happy, contented. Until, I crossed paths with George again. We talked but I thought it would be harmless this time. We discussed business ventures and it was clean for quite some time, until we decided to meet for a coffee as his way for thanking me for helping him get the art piece that his boss wanted. He offered to send me home and I accepted, there in the car he attempted multiple times to kiss me until I gave him a quick smack upon reaching home. Then he called me that night, telling me why I was so dry and I confronted him that I know he has a girlfriend and he never told me about it. I cried because I was too infatuated to him that time and I felt betrayed. He told me he's sorry and if it's fine for him to come so we could talk. Stupid me, allowed it. He came and suddenly the tension between us started he told me he has feelings for me but never said anything about his partner, I then confessed that I recently got myself a boyfriend and if we push this then it will be cheating. He told me we could be discreet about it and started doing to me. I reciprocated but in the end I did not allow him to get under my pants, it was 2nd base and up. We never resolved the issue and he went home. Upon reaching home, he told me he was disappointed because I wasnt all in that night, then I said I just cant. I thought of opening up how to fix the issue and he kept telling me things that we should do to not get caught, I was giving ideas too and was not thinking it through. He stopped the call and there I was, left with a million shame and disgust in my body, I messaged him to not do it again and it was so easy for him to say that will be the last time then. 
It slapped me in the face, how can I do this to my partner. How can I betray my partner for this TRASH. I was also too guilty for his partner, I stalked their social and I cried for the girl, she did not deserve what we did. 
I was left there for hours thinking and crying when I decided to no longer explain myself and just block George in all medium for the last time I hope. 
Now all that's left is, what should I do? I don't deserve my partner but I don't think I can let him go, I love him. I was just too lustful and let my limerence get the best of me. 😭",2,1758698630.0,AmIOverreacting,6,1.0,False
1np5six,https://www.reddit.com/r/GINWORLDART/comments/1np5six/why_are_people_around_the_world_turning_to_korean/,Why Are People Around the World Turning to Korean Ginseng?,"# The Global Health Trend and the Rise of Korean Ginseng

In recent years, there has been a growing global interest in **wellness** and natural dietary supplements. Korean ginseng, long known for its benefits in restoring energy and supporting immunity, fits right into this global health movement and has attracted strong attention from consumers abroad.

As of 2023, the global trade volume of ginseng roots was valued at **USD 339 million**, marking a growth of more than 7% compared to the previous year. Among this, Korea’s ginseng exports accounted for around **USD 91.8 million (about 398 tons)**, making Korea one of the world’s leading ginseng exporters.

# From Asia to the U.S. – Expanding Export Markets

Traditionally, Korean ginseng has been highly popular in Asian markets such as China, Hong Kong, and Japan. In China, where gift-giving during Lunar New Year is a major tradition, Korean ginseng is often seen as a premium present.

More recently, the demand has spread to Vietnam, the United States, and even European markets. Leading Korean ginseng brands such as KGC (CheongKwanJang) now distribute products to **over 40 countries**, positioning Korean red ginseng as a global wellness symbol.

# Why Consumers Choose Korean Ginseng

|Category|Key Point|Real-World Example|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Premium Image & Trust**|Six-year cultivation, traditional processing, and government certification ensure quality|CheongKwanJang recognized as the premium “K-Ginseng” brand in 40+ countries|
|**Wellness-Oriented Benefits**|Energy, immunity, and circulation support match modern health concerns|In the U.S., ginseng is marketed as a caffeine-free natural alternative|
|**Cultural Appeal**|Rich heritage, royal court medicine, and its unique human-shaped roots|In China and Hong Kong, Korean ginseng is a popular Lunar New Year gift|
|**Growth Potential**|Declining domestic demand redirected into export expansion|In 2023, red ginseng exports rose by more than 30% year-on-year|
|**Policy & Certification**|Eased import restrictions make market entry smoother|The U.S. recently approved imports of fresh Korean ginseng roots|

# Key Factors Behind Its Global Popularity

1. **Premium Quality and Brand Reliability**  Korean ginseng is widely recognized for its six-year cultivation process and traditional processing methods. Major brands, especially CheongKwanJang, have established a strong global reputation where “K-Ginseng” is synonymous with premium quality.
2. **Alignment with Wellness Trends**  The well-known benefits of ginseng — fatigue recovery, immune support, and improved blood circulation — align perfectly with what today’s health-conscious consumers are looking for. In Western markets, it is even gaining traction as a healthier alternative to coffee and energy drinks.
3. **Government and Industry Standards**  Korea’s ginseng industry has invested heavily in R&D, certifications, and strict quality management. For instance, the United States recently lifted import restrictions on Korean fresh ginseng, giving the industry new opportunities for expansion.
4. **Cultural Storytelling**  Legends of ginseng as a royal court tonic or as a root shaped like a human figure add cultural depth and appeal. For international consumers, this transforms ginseng into more than a supplement — it becomes a **premium product with a story**.

# Challenges That Remain

The global outlook for Korean ginseng is promising, but there are still challenges:

* **Regulatory barriers**: Many countries have strict classifications between supplements and medicines.
* **Logistics and tariffs**: Fresh ginseng is perishable, making transport costly and complicated.
* **Rising competition**: Canadian and Chinese ginseng producers are increasing their presence.
* **Brand recognition gaps**: In some markets, awareness of “K-Ginseng” is still limited.

# The Future Outlook

While domestic consumption has slowed somewhat in the post-pandemic era, exports are accelerating. In fact, Korean red ginseng exports grew by **over 30% year-on-year in 2023**, showing strong overseas momentum.

As wellness and premium gifting continue to gain importance worldwide, Korean ginseng is well-positioned to become **“a global icon of health and tradition.”**",1,1758698541.0,GINWORLDART,0,1.0,False
1np5sef,https://i.redd.it/8aaqutsjd2rf1.png,"Once Discarded, Now Desired","Chapter 1 Here's The Divorce Agreement

""Here's the divorce agreement. Go through it, and if everything looks fine, sign your name.""



Inside the CEO's office of the Todd Group, Jonny Todd slid a set of papers across the desk toward Eleanor Todd.



Eleanor's eyes lingered on the papers, shadowed with emotions she kept hidden. ""Do we truly have to end our marriage?""



At her words, Jonny arched his brows, amusement flickering in his tone. ""What else were you hoping for? Our marriage only existed to make my grandmother happy.""



While speaking, he reached for the hand of the woman at his side, his voice softening. ""And now that Lainey has returned, I need to restore her place and give her the respect she deserves.""



Eleanor slowly raised her head, her gaze falling on the woman who had always lived in her husband's heart--Lainey Gilbert. Lainey was Jonny's childhood friend and ex-girlfriend. 



Three years earlier, the Todd family and the Gilbert family had planned an engagement for Jonny and Lainey. 



But before the engagement ceremony could happen, Jonny was in a car crash that left his legs broken, with doctors warning he might never walk again. 



Once the news reached the Gilberts, they abruptly canceled the arrangement and sent Lainey overseas. 



Yet even with their callous rejection, Jonny never erased Lainey from his heart. 



With her sudden return, he was impatient to dissolve his marriage with Eleanor and welcome Lainey as his wife. 



Lainey stood in a light white dress, dimples flashing as she smiled, looking every bit like a fragile bloom in full beauty. 



She carried a beauty that was hard to deny. 



It made perfect sense that Jonny had clung to her image all these years. 



When Eleanor said nothing, Lainey faced her with apparent sincerity. ""Mrs. Todd, Jonny and I share real love. I hope you'll give us your blessing.""



Yet how could love be genuine when she had abandoned him the moment he was crippled, only to return once he recovered? 



A dry laugh slipped from Eleanor as her eyes shifted toward Jonny. 



""A divorce is fine. But after what I've done for your family all those three years, I won't leave empty-handed. I expect fair compensation.""



Because Sallie Todd had once helped her in the orphanage, Eleanor had agreed without hesitation when the old woman asked her to marry her grandson, Jonny. 



Since then, she had poured herself into the role of a loyal wife. 



She had even grown a faint affection for him while watching his efforts to stand on his own again. 



But despite her devotion, three years had done nothing to soften his heart. 



Letting go now was the only path left. 



Still, her part in pushing the Todd Group to its successful listing was no small matter. 



She would not allow her hard work to vanish without acknowledgment. 



Jonny laughed under his breath as he lit a ci\*\*rette, his features sharpening in the haze of sm\*\*ke. 



""Don't worry. Sign the papers, and you'll have $70 million along with a riverside villa.""



Although Eleanor meant little to him, he couldn't ignore the fact that she had stayed by his side while his legs were useless. That was enough to settle the debt between them. 



""I'll give you two days to think. If you want anything more..."" he began. 



""There's no need."" Eleanor lifted the pen with steady grace and signed her name. ""By tomorrow morning, I'll move out and leave the place open for you and Miss Gilbert.""



Jonny felt a spark of satisfaction at her decisiveness. 



Even he could not deny that Eleanor had been the model wife. She was beautiful, compliant, and skilled at keeping the household in order. 



Yet to him, her nature was unbearably bland. She lived like a machine, going through tasks without spirit or surprise. Dull, unchanging, and without spark. She could never stir his de\*\*re. 



What he longed for was a partner who understood him, someone who could stand at his side through every storm. In his mind, only Lainey fit that role. 



Jonny gathered up the contract and had it delivered to the court, ready to offer Eleanor a few courteous words, but Lainey leaned close and gave his sleeve a small tug. 



""Jonny, I was thinking... I really like that villa too,"" Lainey said. 





Chapter 2 Are You Out Of Your Mind

""Hmm?"" Jonny lifted his brows with mild surprise, studying Lainey curiously. 



Hardly ever did Lainey ask anything of him. She had always carried herself as though she were above the material concerns, distant and untouchable. 



Catching his reaction, Lainey raised her eyes with a faint, shy look. ""Didn't you once tell me that the villa had the perfect surroundings and could serve as our future home after marriage?""



Memories of their past sweetness softened him, and without much thought, Jonny nodded. ""If that's what you want, then consider it yours.""



Eleanor observed their sickening harmony, her lips curling into a mocking smirk.



""Jonny, only moments ago you promised me that house. Now you hand it over to her. Doesn't that strike you as shameless?""



Her words caught him off guard. 



During their three years together, she had always been quiet and yielding, never daring to speak to him in such a tone. 



His forehead creased, his voice edged with irritation. ""It's only one villa. I own plenty of properties. Pick whichever you want, and I'll transfer it to you.""



Lainey, sensing his displeasure, quickly added, ""Mrs. Todd, if you'll let me take the villa, I'll add another $10 million to your compensation.""



Eleanor's gaze swept over her with contempt. ""Miss Gilbert, are you joking? That villa alone is worth at least $60 million on the market. Do you really think $10 million can buy it from me?""



The color drained from Lainey's face, and she turned toward Jonny with wounded eyes. ""Jonny, that's not what I meant.""



Unmoved by her performance, Eleanor interjected sharply, ""If you want that villa so badly, I won't refuse outright. But the price is this--Jonny must exchange it for ten percent of the Todd Group's shares.""



""What?!"" Lainey's voice rose in disbelief. ""Mrs. Todd, are you insane?""



The Todd Group was publicly listed, and ten percent of its stock was worth over one hundred million. 



Eleanor's demand was outrageous, and everyone in the room knew it. 



Jonny's face turned grim at once. ""Eleanor, don't test my patience.""



Unfazed, Eleanor met his glare. ""Either give me the shares or the villa, Jonny. The decision is yours.""



The air thickened with sudden tension. 



Sensing the hostility mounting, Lainey tightened her hold on Jonny's arm and begged softly, ""Jonny, forget it. I don't need that villa anymore. Wherever we live, as long as I'm beside you, I'll be content.""



Those words calmed Jonny, and the severity in his face eased somewhat. 



He turned back to Eleanor with a cold look. ""The villa is yours then.""



Knowing she had secured her rightful claim, Eleanor lost interest in further argument and started to walk away. 



But Lainey's voice rang out behind her. ""Mrs. Todd!""



When Eleanor turned, she found Lainey smiling sweetly. ""Thank you for looking after Jonny during these years. From now on, I'll make sure to learn how to be his wife properly,"" Lainey said. 



Though the tone sounded gentle, every syllable carried a challenge. 



Eleanor regarded her quietly, then burst out with sudden laughter. 



Striding back to the desk, she grabbed Jonny's untouched cup of coffee and flung it straight over both of them. 



""Ah!"" Lainey screamed as the hot liquid splattered across her white dress, staining it badly and leaving her disheveled. 



Jonny's tailored suit was soaked as well, and fury twisted his face. ""Eleanor! Are you out of your mind?""



She set the empty cup back onto the table with deliberate calm, her smile sharp. ""My mistake. I just caught sight of something repulsive and couldn't hold back.""



Without sparing them another glance, she walked out with steady steps, leaving the two of them in their disgrace. 





Chapter 3 Isn't That Eleanor Over There !

The moment Eleanor walked out of the Todd Group headquarters, her phone buzzed with a message from her closest friend, Lillian Brooks. 



""It's my birthday today. I know you probably can't come, but I just wanted to remind you. Honestly, I don't know what kind of spell that j\*\*k Jonny has on you. You've cut yourself off from everyone for his sake.""



With little thought, Eleanor sent back a reply. ""Give me the address.""



For a beat there was silence, and then her screen lit up with a text. 



""What the h\*\*l? What's happening?""



Eleanor's fingers moved with calm precision. ""I've signed the divorce agreement.""



""Oh my God, you finally broke free of that lovesick title. Stay put. I'm coming to you right away!""



... 



A sleek maroon convertible sped on the highway. 



Behind the wheel, Lillian tipped her sunglasses down and gave Eleanor a playful whistle. ""Eleanor, since you're finally out of that nightmare, we're celebrating at Velvet Club tonight. We're going to have fun.""



Eleanor leaned lazily against the seat, her voice quiet. ""Alright.""



Lillian's curiosity got the better of her. ""So what pushed you to finally cut ties? Let me guess--Lainey's back, isn't she?""



A faint smile touched Eleanor's lips. ""Congratulations. You guessed it.""



Lillian slid her sunglasses off and remarked with a smirk, ""Back then, Lainey ran off the moment he ended up in a wheelchair, and now that she's returned, he's chasing after her like some lovesick f\*\*l. Do you think Jonny damaged more than his legs in that car crash?""



""Hard to say.""



""And you, wasting three whole years tied to that useless man,"" Lillian continued. ""Good thing there weren't any kids, or the divorce would've been a nightmare.""



A quiet laugh escaped Eleanor. ""There was never a chance of that. He and I never even shared a b\*d.""



""What?!"" Lillian almost lost hold of the steering wheel. ""You're telling me you were married for three years and never sl\*\*t together?!""



Eleanor's beauty was undeniable. If that was true, then was Jonny incapable? 



""He was keeping himself pure for Lainey."" Just mentioning the two of them made Eleanor's stomach twist. ""Enough about him. Can you drop me off so I can change first?""



""Of course!""



By eight that evening, the Velvet Club was in full swing. It was Elepdon's largest entertainment venue, a gathering place for the city's wealthy and powerful, where extravagance ruled and a single bottle of w\*\*e could cost hundreds of thousands. 



Lillian's eyes sparkled as she glanced at Eleanor. ""Now this is the Eleanor I remember!""



That night, Eleanor's figure was wrapped in a sleek red dress that traced every curve. With loose waves tumbling over her shoulders and crimson lips to match, she was a vision that drew every eye. 



Once Eleanor was seated, Lillian gave her shoulder a quick squeeze. ""Stay here. I'll track down some top-shelf w\*\*e.""



""Alright.""



Eleanor's allure was undeniable; even as she sat still beneath the lights, her presence drew the eyes of countless men in an instant.



Out of nowhere, a man with blond hair swaggered up, flashing her a greasy smile. ""Hey, beautiful. Sitting alone must be boring. How about sharing a drink with me?""



Across the c\*\*b, Jonny stepped inside accompanied by his younger sister, Emma Todd. 



From a nearby booth, Lainey lifted her hand in greeting, her smile poised. ""Jonny, Emma, over here.""



Emma hurried over, her face glowing with excitement. ""Lainey, I'm so happy you're back. I've missed you so much!""



""I've missed you too."" The reply was warm, but Lainey's eyes never strayed from Jonny. 



She was just about to draw him in with another gesture when Emma's voice rang out in surprise. ""Jonny, isn't that Eleanor over there?!""



Jonny's head turned toward the direction Emma pointed. 



Under the shifting lights, a striking figure rested on a barstool, her long legs revealed beneath the hem of her skirt, elegant and mesmerizing. 





Chapter 4 Leave Me Alone

Had he not recognized that familiar face, Jonny never would have guessed the woman before him was the plain wife he had grown so tired of. 



Eleanor seemed caught in the unwanted attention of a man, her cold expression giving her feelings away. 



""Look at her, pretending to be a saint at home, and now she's acting wild the moment you split up. What a shameless s\*\*t!"" Emma, who had always despised her, sneered. 



In the past, she had said worse in front of Jonny without consequence. This time, though, heat surged through him like fire. 



""Enough! Watch your mouth!"" he snapped at his sister. 



Emma's lips twisted in a pout at the unexpected rebuke. 



Lainey laid a gentle hand on Emma's back, her eyes sly as she fanned the flames. ""Jonny, don't you find it suspicious? She's changed already... maybe she's already warming up to someone new?""



Jonny's stare grew heavier, his silence darker than words. 



""Why so cold, gorgeous? Maybe a k\*\*s will warm you up,"" the blond man teased, circling Eleanor like a predator who smelled bl\*\*d. 



Eleanor's brow creased with disgust. ""Leave me alone.""



""Oh, I like my women with fight in them. The feistier, the better. Come on, let me show you a good time."" His hand lunged brazenly toward her ch\*\*t. 



A cold laugh slipped from Eleanor's lips as she snatched up an expensive bottle of red w\*\*e and smashed it hard against his head.



The bottle shattered on impact, drenching the blond man's face in w\*\*e. 



""Are you f\*\*king kidding me!"" he yelled, smearing the li\*\*id off his skin. 



""You crazy bi\*\*h! Do you have any idea who I am? I'm from the Murphy family. Tonight you'll be begging be\*\*ath me, I swear!""



The entire club froze, eyes snapping toward the chaos, eager to see how it would end. 



Up on the third floor, behind a wide glass window, Ryland Brooks leaned back with narrowed eyes, amusement flickering across his face.



""Look at that--Brice Murphy really loves hearing himself talk, throwing around his family name like it means something.""



Within Elepdon's upper circles, Brice was a nobody compared to the man seated across from Ryland--Nolan Stewart, heir to the Stewart family and head of Stewart Group. 



""Nolan, you've been staring at that woman for a long time. Don't tell me she caught your interest?"" Ryland continued.



Lazily swirling the w\*\*e in his glass, Nolan let his gaze linger on the woman draped in bright red. ""Yeah, she's really... interesting.""



Ryland's brow arched in surprise. ""That's unexpected. No woman has ever managed to draw your attention before.""



He recalled faintly that the woman might even be a friend of his sister's. 



Meanwhile, Brice, the blond man downstairs, had lost all composure, his rage threatening to ignite the room. 



Jonny's face darkened as he sat brooding, then he suddenly rose to his feet. 



Lainey's eyes widened in shock. ""Wait, Jonny, are you actually going to step in for Eleanor?""



""Have you lost your mind, Jonny? That woman brought this on herself by fl\*\*ting with Brice. Why would you stick your neck out?"" Emma said. 



""She was my wife for three years. I won't stand here and pretend I don't know her,"" Jonny retorted, seizing a convenient justification for his actions. 



""But--"" Emma started, but she faltered as two imposing figures descended the staircase.

Hi everyone,


 I am 35M, and from Northamptonshire, East Midlands, England. I am looking to make new genuine long-term friends and friendships, and ideally it would be great to meet people to hang out with regularly in person, as well as chat on text/ phone/video call etc.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.

In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).

I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.

Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain (and preferably in nearby regions to me like London, West Midlands, East Midlands etc) to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me).

In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

**PLATONIC FRIENDSHIP ONLY, AND ALSO PREFERABLY BASED IN BRITAIN/UK. TO KEEP THINGS RELEVANT, I PLEASE ASK THAT YOU ONLY MESSAGE ME IF YOU ARE GENUINELY SERIOUS ABOUT LOOKING FOR LONG-TERM FRIENDSHIPS, AND HAVE COMMON/SIMILAR INTERESTS. I AM REALLY NOT INTERESTED IN TALKING TO ANYONE WHO PLANS TO GHOST ME AFTER A CONVERSATION. ",1,1758698484.0,MakeFriendsUK,0,1.0,False

It seems simple, right? So simple that most of us don’t even think about it. And yet… your breath is the line between life and death. Literally. The only difference between a living person and a dead person? Breath. One stops, the other continues.

And here’s the shocking truth: while we spend hours worrying about our jobs, our bodies, our future, most of us are ignoring the one thing that keeps us truly alive. Our breath.

# Why Breath is the Most Important Thing You’re Ignoring

You wake up, drink coffee, scroll through your phone, check emails, rush to work. And all the while, your breath is shallow, tight, and distracted. We live as if breathing is automatic—and it is—but that doesn’t mean we are doing it right.

Breath is more than oxygen. It’s the bridge between your body and mind, between your emotions and your thoughts. Yet, most of us breathe in ways that actually **limit life**:

* Short, shallow breaths that keep you anxious and tired  
* Holding your breath unknowingly when stressed  
* Rapid chest breathing that triggers your body’s “fight or flight” mode  

Have you ever felt exhausted after a stressful day even if you didn’t move much? That’s your breath telling you, “I’m working overtime, and so are you.”

Here’s something to relate to: notice your day-to-day life. When was the last time you really took a full, conscious breath? Most people can’t remember. And that’s the problem. Shallow breathing isn’t just a habit—it’s silently controlling your energy, focus, and happiness.

# Are You Breathing Wrong?

Here’s a quick self-check:

* Do you feel tension in your neck or shoulders most of the time?  
* Does your chest rise more than your belly when you inhale?  
* Do you sometimes feel short of breath, even when relaxed?  
* Do you sigh or yawn frequently without realizing why?  

If yes, congratulations—you’re breathing the way most of humanity does: wrong. Shallow, stressed, disconnected from your own body. And guess what? This one habit is subtly affecting **everything** in your life: your mood, your relationships, your focus, even your health.

# Ancient Indian Yoga Techniques to Breathe Right

The yogis of India discovered something profound: **breath is the doorway to consciousness.** When you breathe consciously, you can calm the mind, energize the body, and even shift your emotions. Here are some techniques you can try:

1. **Diaphragmatic Breathing (Belly Breathing)** Place your hand on your belly. Inhale so your belly rises, not your chest. Exhale slowly, letting it fall. This simple act lowers stress, relaxes muscles, and helps you feel more present.  
2. **Alternate Nostril Breathing (Nadi Shodhana)** Close one nostril, inhale deeply, switch, exhale. This balances the left and right hemispheres of your brain, reduces anxiety, and clears your energy.  
3. **Ujjayi Breath (Ocean Breath)** Slightly constrict the throat while breathing deeply. The sound is like the ocean—steady and rhythmic. It improves focus, stamina, and even your emotional resilience.  
4. **Kapalabhati (Skull Shining Breath)** Quick, forceful exhales with passive inhales. This energizes the body, clears toxins, and sharpens mental clarity.  

These aren’t just exercises—they are ancient life hacks for modern living.

# The Life-Changing Benefits of Conscious Breathing

When you start breathing consciously, things change faster than you imagine. Here’s what happens:

* **Stress melts away**: Your nervous system calms, anxiety drops.  
* **Sleep improves**: You fall asleep faster and sleep deeper.  
* **Energy skyrockets**: You feel awake and alive without caffeine.  
* **Focus sharpens**: Your mind stops wandering and stays present.  
* **Emotional balance**: You feel less reactive and more in control.  
* **Physical vitality**: Better oxygen flow improves metabolism, posture, and overall health.  

All from something you do thousands of times a day without thinking.

# How Bringing Focus to Your Breath Can Change Everything

It sounds almost too simple. But awareness is everything. Start with just **two minutes a day**. Notice your inhalation, notice your exhalation. Let your mind settle. Over time, your reactions, your energy, and even your sense of happiness begin to shift.

Breathing is not just a tool for relaxation—it’s a tool for transformation. The moment you bring focus to your breath, you bring focus to your life. You stop being a passenger and start being the driver.

Even simple things ordering coffee, meeting someone new, or speaking up in a group felt like climbing a mountain. I remember standing in line at Starbucks, rehearsing my order ten times in my head, only to whisper it nervously at the counter.

I tried to “push through” and even read about CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy), but getting professional help wasn’t always possible for me. That’s when I came across self guided VR therapy. Honestly, at first I thought it was just another tech gimmick. But trying it completely changed how I deal with anxiety.


What Is Self Guided VR Therapy?

Instead of only imagining social situations, VR therapy lets you experience them in a safe virtual environment. You wear a headset, choose a scenario (like giving a short talk or chatting with strangers), and practice at your own pace.
Over time, your brain gets used to these situations and begins to unlearn the fear response. It feels surprisingly real, but you always know you can pause or stop whenever you want.


Why It Works

Safe exposure you can face your fears without real world consequences.

Gradual progression start with simple scenarios, then move to harder ones.

Rewiring the brain repeated safe practice helps you build confidence.

Privacy & control no need for appointments, no judgment, no pressure.

Backed by science recent studies show VR therapy reduces social and performance anxiety effectively.


My Personal Takeaways

At first, I only managed a 5 minute session, but even that made me realize my anxiety wasn’t permanent.
Practicing public speaking in VR gave me the courage to actually speak up in a work meeting for the first time in months.
The best part: I didn’t have to rely on anyone else. I could practice anytime, privately.
How You Can Try It Too
Get a VR headset (Meta Quest, Pico, etc.).
Choose an app focused on exposure therapy.
Start with short sessions and build up slowly.
Track your progress it’s motivating to see small wins add up.


Final Thoughts

I’m not saying VR therapy is a “magic pill,” but for me, it was the first time I felt real progress without pressure. It gave me hope that overcoming social anxiety is actually possible.

The relationship was really great — we laughed a lot, shared everything, talked about everything, and traveled together. He was really my best friend, and I was convinced we would grow old together.

A month ago, my ex went on a hut trip with a large group (including two of my friends). He was really dreading it, but I knew he’d enjoy it, so I encouraged him to go. Everything went well until near the end of the trip when he started responding more distantly in his messages. I could tell something was wrong, but I couldn't figure out what it was.

Once we got home, he dropped the bombshell that he wasn’t sure about anything anymore. He was overwhelmed by the fact that I want children and he doesn’t (at least not yet), and it made him doubt whether we were right for each other. We took a week apart to think about things, and after that week, he very spontaneously ended things. I was devastated that after 4 years (with no signs that things were going downhill), it could end so suddenly.

It’s been about 3 weeks since he broke up with me, and I was out walking with a friend when she told me that he was spotted with a woman who had also been on the hut trip. ""Quite coincidentally,"" her relationship had also ended after the trip, and they decided to go motorcycling and have a coffee together.

I’ve been in a relationship before where my partner cheated on me, so my mind is all over the place. My ex (who has never lied to me) says that the breakup is unrelated and that it was just an innocent coffee.

Honestly, I don’t know what to think, and I feel incredibly awful. Maybe it's part of his healing process to seek attention from other women to feel better about himself. Because I’ve sat next to him enough times when he cried about our situation, so it does hurt him. But I just don’t know how to handle this. On one hand, I feel so angry, and on the other, I feel completely worthless and easily replaceable. I just want to banish him from my life and never think about this again, but unfortunately, I’m not done with him yet in terms of belongings…

Has anyone been through a similar situation and have any advice on how to get through this?",2,1758697446.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

We live in different countries, but I actually plan to move to the country he lives in for work (though in a different city).

The thing is, I have a crush on this guy. It might sound funny that I like someone I haven’t met yet, but I genuinely want to get to know him more deeply than just as a pen pal. For now, I haven’t revealed any of my feelings, but I’m planning to ask him in person next month when we meet if this is something he might reciprocate.

He’s a really logical, rational type of guy who holds firmly to his own opinions, so I’m afraid suggesting a long-distance relationship would likely end in rejection. That’s why I was wondering how to increase my chances before we meet up, and what I thought of is whether repeatedly giving genuine compliments over text would work on this type of guy as well to make him like me at least a bit.

here's the spec of the pump:

Power: 12v 3.5A

Flow: 4L/M

Pressure: 80 PSI

Oh yeah, can i install this kind of pressure tank in any direction? like upside down?

  
it's gonna be: fresh water jerry can > 12v pump > pressure tank > 45 PSI irrigation garden water pressure regulator > t split to the jug rinser and faucet

1np5dqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1np5dqt/not_sure_if_i_want_to_wreck_the_dynamic_at_my/,Not sure if I want to wreck the dynamic at my place of work,"Hey ya'll, I'm in a bit of a pickle and would like some advice as to what I should do. I have a meeting with my workplace's compliance director about an incident report made by a coworker who was recently fired. The report is about my manager and coworker mistreating one of our clients.

Context: I work at an agency funded by the state and they provide resources for people with developmental/intellectual disabilities. Because of the population we work with, there are a lot of rules we have to follow like: respect the individual's privacy + property, try to let them be as independent as possible, don't take their behavior personally, don't be biased/have favorites, don't let emotions cloud your judgement/actions. I work in a group home taking care of four clients. There are currently four staff working at the group home including me. Due to the setting, I work closely with these staff, one of them being the manager. 

One of the clients, let's call them M, is a bit more difficult than the other three. However, I believe M is being treated unfairly due to her behaviors. She sometimes yells, smears feces in the bathroom (she hasn't done it in a while), doesn't wash her hands after using the bathroom, blatantly lies (not anything harmful), and isn't the nicest person to deal with. Despite all that, she really isn't that bad and most of my interactions with her are pleasant. 

The problem: The manager, F, and my coworker, A, do not like her and are not subtle about it. M does not like 10 min rice, but likes sticky rice from Chinese restaurants. I know on at least one occasion F and A have decided not to give M the sticky rice because she doesn't like the 10min rice even though they know she likes sticky rice. And F keeps putting the 10 min rice on the menu every week even though it would be incredibly easy to sub it for something else. M just throws the rice out. 

Similarly, M in the past (3 yrs ago) has expressed she does not like coffee. The past year she has been asking/taking some from the coffee pot (there is enough for her). F told staff that she is not allowed to have coffee  until M tells F directly that she likes/wants coffee. 

There was a festival a year ago that all clients had tickets for. A client had another event before the festival so F had to come back to the group home to pick the rest up. She asked me to get everyone ready/see who wants to go. M said she would go, but F said she did not want to take M. 

Another recent example is M had asked to go to Marshalls to get new bras on a Sunday where we literally have 4 hrs where we do nothing but watch TV. We let our manager know and F said no to M. F then went and bought bras without M. And A purposefully does shit to antagonize M just to see her reaction. 

I could provide a few more examples, but this is already way too long so thank you for reading. Anyway, my dilemma is that, since I work so closely with F and A, they'd know I'm the one that said something to the compliance person. They have interviews with him too, and they are obviously going to downplay their behavior.  Plus F isn't that bad of a manager, she just mixes personal shit with work shit sometimes. So while their treatment of M is unfair, I don't know if it warrants me blowing up my workplace.

The night before, we had a sink full of dishes and I was gonna do them, like always. Then my husband tells me not worry about them and I was very expressive about how I’m thankful he’s gonna do them. I come back a week later, he tells me the dishes have been in the dishwasher for a week. I don’t like a dishwasher tbh, I didn’t grow up with one so I rather just wash them because I don’t think it’s that bad of a rash to hand wash them. I open the dishwasher and there’s a terrible smell. We don’t even have dishwasher pods.

I told him that he has to redo them by washing them by hand. Today, it’s three weeks since he put them in. He kept saying he’ll wash them tomorrow, then the day after, then on the weekend, then the next day, etc. I just spent 45 minutes rewashing them. I’m so annoyed. There was food still on the plates, food in between the forks, and a coffee ring inside 2 of the mugs. He’s sleeping right now and I sent him a text saying to not offer to take off any of my load again if I’m just gonna end up having to do it myself. My husband is very lazy, he even puts off taking out the trash which is like right next to our door leading out. I’m so annoyed that I could cry. My life has just been a repeat of cleaning. He has the nerve to complain that I don’t wash dishes right away, that it takes me until before bedtime to get up and do them.

She doesn’t have many friends and always likes meeting people through me, so I usually include her whenever I make a new friend,even on some of my dates, I’ve brought her along.

This guy is smart, flirty, fun to hang around with, but a bit of a fuckboi. The three of us hung out a couple of times, and later he told me he preferred hanging out with just me instead of the three of us together. He’s very into geopolitics and deep conversations, while my friend isn’t really into those topics, so he didn’t enjoy the dynamic much.

I encouraged him to give her a chance and even pushed them to grab coffee together. I also told him beforehand about her health issue and asked him not to bring it up and just be kind, which he totally was, he treated her like a princess to make her feel comfortable. I thought she’d appreciate that since she often says she wishes she had more people to hang out with on weekends.

But I could tell he wasn’t really interested in spending time with her. He was polite and nice in the group chat (he’s like that with everyone), but he made it clear to me he didn’t want to meet her much. I didn’t think it was bad, just how he is, and I figured it would be better if I gently kept some distance between them.

So, I told my friend not to initiate plans with him,if he asks her, fine, but she shouldn’t be the one asking. The moment I said this, she got upset. She demanded to know why and said she wouldn’t listen unless I gave her a reason. I didn’t want to tell her the truth because I thought it would hurt her. So I just said, “Don’t ask please.”

That spiraled into a huge argument. She painted me as the villain, saying unless I give her a reason, she wouldn’t listen. So I made up something like, “He’s seeing other girls, don’t give him importance right now.” She called my reason childish and said she’d just ask him 2-3 times to hang out, and if he said no, she’d stop. I begged her not to, but she wasn’t willing to listen. She said I am acting like this because I am upset with him, hence asking her to act like this. She said she won't listen unless I give her the reason. 

What I don’t get is why she had such a strong reaction. It was such a small request from me, and she barely knows this guy. It felt like she was ready to pick him over me, her best friend, and she even accused me of being jealous of him. I honestly can’t understand why she blew up at me over this.",5,1758696471.0,indiasocial,2,1.0,False

Break up happening,"Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine posting about this stuff on the internet... but I'm unable to sleep, and my brain is shuffling all over...

My fiance and I have been engaged for 3 years now - long distance, and we're working hard to finish our house and get married this coming spring. The trust between us is immense! Which you definitely need in a long distance relationship. Her career is taking off, and mine is fairly stable. I'm 40, she's early 30s.

Here's what happened, and I'm really sorry to bother people with this!:

Her sister visited her for a couple of weeks. My fiance is extremely busy with new projects, and her sister doesn't feel like talking to me lately (she has those fits every once in a while), so my fiance and I barely talked in the first week. I knew whatever time she had left she would spend it with her sister and friends. Now, the friends: two guys (brothers). I know one of them only. The other guy I never met, but I know that my fiance didn't like him before and he rarely went out with them. Somehow that changed and he started joining them - no questions asked. I started feeling a bit worried that the four of them are only going out together, and she didn't communicate at all. ""Worried"" doesn't mean suspicious - just curious. Our trust wasn't shaken by then.

However, she told me ""We're taking my sister out again since she's leaving in a couple of days"". I said ""great"": I expected more information, like where, what kind of activity... she usually shares this stuff. Nothing. And I purposely waited. She didn't say anything. Somehow, while on the phone with her dad that night, I felt like he's looking at me a bit weird, like ""this is the third time I talk to this dude this week and he didn't know where my daughter is and what she's up to, not once in those times"". It hit me: ""No fucking way!"" I thought... But I couldn't sleep, and I didn't even know why! That's what sucked! I thought I had too much coffee, or maybe because my late father came to mind that I was being a bit anxious. But it was like someone set fire on my soul - around 2am I was pacing like a cokehead on a bad trip! I couldn't stop thinking about her! I thought that was just bizarre! Why am I thinking about her? She does stuff and travels all the time, I never worry! So?... nothing! My soul was aching, my eyes were radiating... I thought about mothers: My grandmother told me once that a mother feels it in her guts sometimes if her child is hurting somewhere, a burning sensation. Sorry, but that's what came to mind during the episode, because that's how I felt!

Her sister left. She's back online with me. I said ""look we need to talk asap"". I told her to finish the work she had on her hands and I'll call tomorrow so we can talk comfortably. We did, and I was hoping she'll know what bothered me, share her perspective, and then we're good. The shock came: I realized those last two days they traveled to another city, with the two brothers, shared an airbnb, and she didn't even mention it before! And she only shared this because I asked if she took her sister outside of the city (I was honestly just talking), and she looked shocked a bit and then shared the information - first saying they took hotel rooms, then saying it was actually an airbnb. She cried, and said nothing happened and that the apartment had three rooms etc.

I exploded! I couldn't believe it! She always told me where she was going, and I never protested! Why did she hide this trip? And why come out about the Airbnb later?

I don't know if anything happened between them. Come to think of it, two brothers and two sisters is kind of a messed up porno scenario that I truly don't believe represents them as people. But what shattered my trust was the whole story, not what happened behind closed doors. And the weird part: That burning sensation that kept me up at night, that soul ache on that very night she traveled, thinking of her cheating and lying and saying ""no fucking way! Three years and she never betrayed my trust!!!""

Sorry for the long story, but here's where I'm at now: I told her to leave me alone for while. During this time she can do whatever the hell she wants, but I need time to cool off and think carefully about what I will do. I also asked her to stop crying and apologizing and swearing that nothing happened, and that she should reflect on what I said to understand where the betrayal was exactly for me. I said I expect more details and less wallowing next time we talk.

I have no idea what to do. My gameplan is breathe, think... I trusted her so much! Her father loves me like a son and I love him back... but I'm worried I can never see her the same way... maybe this was god saving my ass before marriage? I don't know...",2,1758696170.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

December 11, 2115.

The frosty, crisp air bit at his cheeks. For the first time in nearly two decades, Rear Admiral Volkov was wearing a warm, civilian coat that felt like a strangely alien suit of armor as he walked through the reconstructed city center. He was on leave—a word that had almost vanished from his vocabulary—but old habits wouldn't let him stop observing and analyzing.

In the less than four months that had passed since his explosive confrontation in Marcus Thorne's office, changes had occurred. Changes so profound and so rapid that Volkov, a cynic to the bone, was still searching for the catch.

The world, which only a few months ago had been suffocating in the steel grip of a war regime, was beginning to breathe anew. The gigantic factory complexes that had recently churned out tons of armor plating and components for plasma cannons were undergoing a transformation. Their production lines, after a feverish retooling, were now creating elegant electric cars and everyday consumer goods. The economy, freed from the shackles of five-year armament plans, had exploded almost overnight. Earth's budget, previously a black hole that swallowed every credit for the Guard's needs, had finally begun to bleed in the other direction. Funds flowed into public healthcare, a pilot program for a universal basic income was introduced, and repair crews set to work on the crumbling civilian infrastructure that had been ignored for years.

The cities were slowly regaining their color. The gray of concrete and the black of military insignia were giving way to vibrant murals and bright storefronts. The omnipresent propaganda had weakened. It was still visible—here and there he would glimpse Thorne's face or a reminder of the mission to Habitat 1—but its voice was no longer a deafening roar, but rather a fading echo.

Volkov passed a window that had recently displayed a poster calling for citizens to donate scrap metal for the fleet. Now, in the same spot, behind a clean pane of glass, stood a small, gleaming coffee machine. He was tempted. He entered the newly opened, private café. The aroma of freshly ground beans was almost overwhelming in its normality. He ordered a hot coffee with milk. It was good. Real. Not the synthetic, military-grade substitute. Holding the warm cup in his hands, he gazed out the window at the street.

On the massive telescreens, where ‘Thor’ class battleships had once paraded in an endless loop, advertisements now played. They promoted new furniture that no longer looked like clunky, functional blocks of metal. It had rounded edges, soft upholstery, and warm colors. There was even a certain beauty to it. He saw families strolling without haste, people talking, even laughing. Their faces were no longer so tense, so determined.

He walked on, passing a construction site surrounded by a high fence. Behind it, the skeleton of a hideous ammunition factory was dying, methodically being demolished. A huge information board did not display another military project, but a rendering of what was to be built here: a sprawling park. Greenery, pathways, a playground with laughing children on swings. The symbolism was so obvious it was brutal. From a place that produced death, life was to be born.

Volkov stopped, the vapor from his breath rising toward the gray sky. The words he had screamed in Thorne's face that day still echoed in his head. The anger he had felt was pure and righteous. But now, looking at all this evidence, he felt something else. A complex mixture of relief, a still-smoldering distrust, and… involuntary respect.

Admiral Marcus Thorne hadn't lied, he thought, finishing the last sip of his coffee.

The price had been monstrous and unimaginable, and the world he had sacrificed would never return. But he had kept his word. He had loosened the reins. And Volkov understood that this new, regenerating world was just another stage in Marcus's game. The foundation for the true goal—the 3rd Fleet's expedition to Habitat 1.

The smell of grilled meat and sharp spices drifted over the small, bustling square. For Lyra and Jimmy, it was an aroma they had yearned for throughout their more than eighteen-year mission. They sat at a metal table in front of a small kebab stand, biting into crispy buns filled to the brim with flavors that seemed almost unreal after years of eating sterile, ship-board rations.

Next to them sat Commander Lena Kowalska, a woman with a sharp gaze and a confident smile. They had met her a month earlier, on leave at a Guard resort in the Bahamas. They had been there with Kael, who was trying to drink away his sorrows after returning and celebrate his new rank. Kael himself, with his typical dark humor, claimed he got the promotion to Master Sergeant mainly for surviving without getting all his men killed in the process.

""Hey, Kael, over here!"" Lena called, waving her hand.

He walked over to them. He finally looked like someone who had found a sliver of peace. He was clean-shaven, dressed in well-fitting civilian clothes, and the frantic emptiness was gone from his eyes. He was sober.

""Well, well, well! New rank, new you,"" Lyra stated, nudging him with her elbow. Jimmy smiled in approval.

""Hilarious, sis,"" Kael replied, taking a seat. ""How are my two lovebirds? Still cooing together?""

""Of coursh,"" Jimmy answered with his mouth full of kebab.

""Order it spicy, you won't regret it,"" Lena advised.

""Alright, if the Commander says so."" Kael nodded and went to the window. He returned a moment later with a steaming wrap. ""How's your ship, Lena? Is the ‘Arthur C. Clarke’ ready to fly?""

""Good as new. Actually, better than new,"" she replied, pushing aside her empty plate. ""It's been upgraded to the seventh-generation standard. She ‘gained weight’ from twelve thousand to fifteen thousand tons. They reinforced the armor and added some new systems. The biggest change is the automation. They cut the crew from one hundred and twenty down to just sixty-five.""

Kael let out a low whistle. ""Fewer targets to hit.""

""Exactly. They also installed a new reactor, more powerful plasma cannons, and one newer generation railgun for precision planetary bombardment. But the best parts are the new torpedoes and decoys. They're supposed to drastically increase our chances of survival in a battle.""

""Is that the new tech?"" asked Lyra, who, as a sniper, was always interested in ways to avoid detection.

""Yes. It's all thanks to the L'thaarr. Their knowledge of the Plague's sensors proved invaluable. It allowed us to develop effective jamming methods and create decoys that perfectly mimic our ships' signatures. The guys from testing say the Plague's systems are getting completely fooled. They're indispensable.""

""We know, we know…"" Lyra began.

""...our father talks about it all the time,"" Kael finished for her. ""Says they're incredibly intelligent. For generations, they were the Plague's slaves, forced to build their technology. They knew it inside and out, down to every last screw and circuit. Now that knowledge is working for us.""

""So, back to the rest of our leave… where are we planning to go next?"" Jimmy asked, smacking his lips with satisfaction.

Kael smiled slyly. ""I'm not going anywhere. I have a certain tactical objective right here.""

Lyra raised an eyebrow. ""A tactical objective?""

""After the promotion, I can finally hit on the MP with a clear conscience. She's hot. I met her during my first week of leave.""

Lyra snorted with laughter. ""You're kidding! Is it the one who called me from the MP station at three in the morning to come and get your drunk ass?""

""Yeah, that's the one,"" Kael admitted without a trace of shame, grinning broadly. ""Speaking of which, I need to go see Mr. Choj for some Gummiberry Juice.""

""You'd better stay away from there,"" Lyra muttered, shaking her head with feigned resignation.

""What MP?"" Lena asked, her interest piqued. Jimmy, sensing an opportunity, immediately jumped on the topic.

""Lena, could it be you're jealous of Kael?"" he laughed.

Lena gave him an amused look, then stated bluntly to all three of them, ""Give it a rest, Jimmy. You know I'm a lesbian. I'm not a fan of that sausage you guys have between your legs.""

A moment of silence fell, which Lena immediately broke by pointing her fork at Lyra. ""I mostly befriended you guys because of her, but I already know she prefers hot dogs.""

Kael burst into a genuine, loud laugh, the likes of which they hadn't heard from him in a long time.

""Anna Biggs. Sergeant,"" he finally answered Lena's question. ""She's a great woman. We even talked later and went for a beer. The only thing was, her subordinate, Andrew, was with her. The son of a bitch is built like a battleship, even without combat armor. But now that I'm a Master Sergeant, I can make my move.""

Lena laughed. ""What, when you were a corporal, you were afraid she'd dominate you in bed?""

Kael shrugged, his grin growing even wider. ""Actually, I really like it when a woman dominates.""

Lyra, who had just taken a large gulp of water to wash down the spicy kebab, choked and spat it all out onto the pavement next to the table. Her brother could still surprise her.

The laughter died down for a moment. Lena set down her fork, her expression turning serious.

""I won't be going anywhere with you guys either.""

""Why not?"" Lyra asked, catching her breath.

""I have to fly to Berlin. To the cemetery."" For a moment, Lena's voice lost its usual, hard confidence. ""My ex-girlfriend… she passed away. We lived together in Warsaw back in 2077, back in college. We were kids, students, and lovers. She would have been 63 now.""

Kael felt a familiar, icy pang in his heart. He saw Blanka's face, her wrinkles, the life she had lived without him. Blanka was 60 now.

""But how? People live for over a hundred years now, thanks to the Hive's medical tech,"" he said quietly.

""A car accident. She left behind a son and a daughter."" Lena smiled sadly. ""Well, they're not children anymore. They're both in their thirties. They look older than we do.""

Those last words hung in the frosty air above them. Suddenly, a shared, unspoken truth hit them: the world was rushing forward, while they were standing still. Thanks to the nanites, their thousand-year bodies didn't change, but time was relentlessly taking away everything and everyone they had ever known. They were becoming relics.

""That's why we have to narrow our search for love to people like us,"" Kael stated, more to himself than to them. His voice was devoid of bitterness, containing only the weight of understanding. He looked at his sister and Jimmy, holding hands. ""You know I'm jealous of you, right? For real. I'm happy for you.""

Later that day.

Kael and Anna met for a casual trip to the cinema. In an age of ubiquitous virtual experiences, a physical movie theater was an anachronism, a relic of the past. One of the last in the world. Stepping inside, with its plush red seats and the smell of real popcorn, was like traveling back in time.

The film showing was Interview with the Vampire, the 1994 classic, digitally restored by computers. Its resolution and sound quality were phenomenal, bringing the old story to life with incredible intensity.

They sat next to each other, a little awkward at first, but when the lights went down and Louis appeared on screen, telling the story of his immortality, everything else ceased to matter. The film's message and plot hit them with the force of a tidal wave. For them, this wasn't fiction about monsters. It was a documentary about loneliness. They were watching the story of beings who had to watch the world they knew pass by, as their mortal loved ones grew old and died, leaving them alone in an eternal night.

Kael wasn't thinking about vampires. He was thinking about Blanka, about his mother, about the world he had lost. He glanced at Anna. In the dim light, he could see her expression was serious, focused. She understood it too. She had served long enough to see civilian friends from the academy start families, go gray, while she still looked the same.

It was an experience neither of them had expected. They were watching a film that was 121 years old. And if fate allowed, they could watch it again in another hundred years, and then a hundred more. Generations would be born and die, and they would endure, anchored in time until, perhaps, the year 3100.

When the screening ended and the lights came up, they didn't need to say much. They looked at each other and saw in the other's eyes the same understanding, the same weight.

""So, will I see you again?"" Anna asked, her voice quiet but certain.

""Definitely,"" Kael replied.

After the show, they made a second date.

Walking home alone through the illuminated, transformed city, Kael felt something akin to peace for the first time since returning to Earth.

That was nice, he thought. And my head doesn't hurt.

The trial of the man under multiple deportation orders (OQTF) accused of raping Claire Geronimi opens at the Paris Criminal Court this Wednesday, September 24. Two years after the attack, the vice-president of the UDR denounces a failing state and a feminism with double standards.

JDNews: What frame of mind are you in as you approach your attacker’s trial?
Claire Geronimi: I feel like a fighter. I chose to make my story public almost two years ago, since my assault in broad daylight on November 11, 2023, in Paris’s 8th arrondissement. I’m doing this not just for myself, but for all women. This trial is a very important step after long months of psychological and legal assessments. It will be intense to look my attacker in the eye again. But it’s necessary.

Two years of waiting to get to this trial—was it long?
Yes, although I was almost lucky. Two years is little compared to other victims who wait five or ten years. But it’s already enormous when you want to move on. My attacker admitted to the facts—this could have gone much faster. The slowness of the justice system is a real problem today in France.

What do you expect from the justice system?
That it enforces the sentence he faces: twenty years in prison for aggravated rape under threat of a weapon. That’s the minimum. Let’s remember there are two victims here! An hour before me, he raped a young woman, Mathilde, using the same method, in the lobby of a building. With sentence reductions, he probably won’t serve the full twenty years. Let’s hope this time the sentence is actually enforced…

At the trial, you’ll see the young woman he allegedly raped before you…
Yes… We support each other. Our meeting was rather unusual because we first saw each other, face to face, at the police station. Our eyes met. We were scared, terrified. We understood each other instantly. Since then, we’ve had quite a few coffees together. The idea is to stand united throughout this trial.

Do you consider this trial essential for your recovery?
A victim can’t truly recover until there’s been a trial. My story became known publicly. Today, I need it to be recognized by the justice system. The most important thing for me is that justice be served.

Are you afraid of a too-lenient verdict?
Of course. Through my association Éclats de femme, I hear every week about absurdly light sentences. So yes, I fear my attacker might get only two or five years in prison. And even if he gets ten, will he even remain in France after his release?

“There are so many victims that police psychologists are almost never available”

Do you know more about your attacker’s background?
This man, originally from the Central African Republic, arrived in France at the age of 16. Placed in foster care, he had already tried to assault two young girls. Social workers had also reported his dangerousness to the justice system. Everything was dismissed! Later, he lived on the streets, was imprisoned… At the time of my assault, he was already under three deportation orders! And nothing was done.

In your eyes, did the state fail?
Totally. What I went through is a double punishment. First assaulted by a criminal, then betrayed by a state that failed in its duty. This man should not have been on French territory. And I’m not an isolated case: the stories of Philippine and Lola revealed the same failures.

Is that sense of abandonment what pushed you to create your association Éclats de femme and get involved in politics?
Exactly. The turning point was when I left the police station after filing my complaint. They handed me a simple A5 sheet listing possible psychological symptoms such as bipolar disorder, blackouts, panic attacks, anxiety attacks… I felt abandoned. They also gave me the phone number of a police psychologist I could call. It was so strange to be given only this little scrap of paper, just like that. And this police psychologist—there are so many victims that she is almost never available. To get an appointment, it takes three weeks, even a month. That’s what pushed me to found Éclats de femme, to support victims from filing complaints to the trial, and to offer self-defense classes as well. But I quickly realized that social action wasn’t enough. Political involvement was also necessary. That’s why I joined Eric Ciotti’s UDR. With MP Christelle D’Intorni, we are proposing a law so that the state can be held accountable when a victim is assaulted by someone under a deportation order.

You didn’t get support from feminist organizations?
Apart from the Némésis collective, none wanted to amplify my voice. I’m not the “right” kind of victim because my attacker isn’t the “right” kind of attacker. I was criticized by left-wing feminists because I pointed out that my attacker was under deportation orders. It’s very hard to be rejected like that, when we should all be united.

Does your political involvement work against you?
Right now, this isn’t about politics. It’s a personal ordeal that requires focus. Political action will come afterward. If there has to be political action, it will be after the trial.

What do you say to victims who sometimes hesitate to speak publicly?
It’s indeed a tough battle. It’s a lifelong commitment, especially when you show your face. But what I want to say to victims is above all: file a complaint. Even if the case is dismissed, at least you will have done your part, and maybe prevented other assaults. It’s a priority.

What do you see happening after the trial?
As long as I still have the energy, I want to continue working with the association, supporting all these women who are assaulted, and pursuing my political involvement. I was lucky enough not to die, unlike others. For me, this has almost become a life mission.",49,1758695497.0,europe_sub,4,0.99,False

I am ""playing"" with my Elizabeth for a few days now and I noticed every time I turn it on the brew boiler goes straight to 120-122°C then slowly down to the wanted temperature (usually set between 91 and 94°C).

I know this is normal and allows for a faster stable temparature but I am curious about one thing:

The OLED screen says ""OK"" after a few minutes whereas the real temperature is still way above 100°C (I am checking the real temperature by pressing the + button). So what happens if I launch an extraction while the screen says OK but the real temperature shows >100°C? Is it going to extract my coffee at >100°C or around the wanted temperature?

1np4uxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1np4uxq/can_i_offer_you_a_nice_hobby_in_these_trying_times/,Can I offer you a nice hobby in these trying times?,"I'm mostly bedridden. I can still walk but it hurts like a bitch, and I can only stay on my feet for about a minute or two before it's sit down or fall down. So I spend most of my days sitting on my bed.  

For my own mental health, I have to make a clear distinction between laying in my bed under the blankets, and sitting on top of it with my back against a pillow and the blankets folded at the foot of the bed.

I love reading and video games and watching TV, and I write terrible fanfiction and spend time chatting with friends,  and wasting time on Reddit. But that's not enough to fill all the hours.

Tonight I'm sitting on my bed, surrounded by brightly colored small plastic boxes with a felt mat on my lap. I have my reading glasses and a 10x magnifying glass with LED lighting, because the glasses aren't always enough.  I am working on a jigsaw puzzle.  

4000 pieces, a map of the world.  I've sorted the pieces into about a dozen categories; the boxes are 5x5x2"" and easy to open and close despite my useless arthritic fingers. They're stackable,  and most importantly,  they don't tip over and spill the pieces when I shift my weight and the mattress jiggles, or when I struggle to my feet to stretch or go to the toilet.  

And if a box is knocked to the floor it doesn't spring open and dump pieces all over the floor where I have zero chance of being able to retrieve them. That was an ongoing problem with the puzzle sorting trays I used for a couple years.  

I stuck temporary labels on.  When I finish this puzzle and begin another,  I'll put new labels on top.  There's 18 boxes in total,  so I can sort pieces into very narrow and specific categories when needed.  If you've never put together 4000 pieces,  you're almost certainly underestimating the scale of the project.  This puzzle is roughly 54"" by 40"" which makes it nearly as wide as I am tall.

The puzzle itself is sitting on a folding table in the middle of my bedroom.  Rather I should say, it's on a thin piece of plywood that's clamped to the table.  The original folding table wasn't large enough, as this is the biggest puzzle I've worked on, and for various logistical reasons it was more convenient to increase the surface area by laying a large piece of plywood on top instead of buying a new table.  There's a custom cut felt mat covering the plywood,  and the puzzle is laid out on that.  

The felt makes it possible to roll up the whole thing with almost no disturbance to the puzzle,  in case I need the table for something else.  I work on my puzzles when I feel like it, and typically begin a new one immediately after finishing the last, so there's been one puzzle or another in some stage of completion on that table for years.  

I sit on my bed with the stacks of plastic sorting boxes within easy reach, and put the puzzles together a section at a time on a 12x12"" felt mat that I can rest on my lap. I'm usually listening to an audiobook while I work, as I find it's less distracting than putting the TV on.  My eyes aren't what they used to be,  so the magnifying glass comes in handy. So does a cup of coffee, or several. 

It only takes a minute to stand up and fit the new section into the rest of the puzzle.  I have a literal cake server from our kitchen that I use to slide sections of puzzle from the mat onto the table without breaking the pieces apart.  If it's a bad pain day I ask someone else to fit the latest section into place, and often I have to ask regardless because I can't reach the center of the puzzle even on my best day.  It's too wide and I'm too short.

I don't understand why people spend days or weeks on a puzzle only to break it up and put it back in the box. How can that be at all satisfying?  It's like filling a notebook with the same drawing on every page over and over.  I frame my completed puzzles and hang them on the wall, or give them away to family. I'm extremely picky about choosing which puzzles are worth it. I love maps of all kinds,  and Disney scenes, and sometimes a beautiful landscape that caught my eye.  

Once I complete this current monstrosity,  I will probably go back to more reasonably sized puzzles,  and the plywood can come off the table.  I recently found on eBay a factory sealed copy of Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice, from the Photomosaics line of puzzles. I haven't done one of those since I was much younger; they're smaller but fiendishly difficult.  It will give my magnifying glass a serious workout.

1np4sh8,https://i.redd.it/gruy40e922rf1.jpeg,You Mee Ramen review,"Location: You Mee, Phoenix Marketcity, Viman Nagar

Ordered: Miso Pork Ramen (“Rich” broth)
This is a new dish as they have an updated menu.
Swiggy, Zomato and Google reviews, all still show the old menu.

TLDR: 
10/10 on taste, 
9.5/10 on service (nitpicking), 
4/10 on beverages

I am Ramen hunting in Pune. Tried Shisuzan and You Mee as of now. Ukiyo, Ginkgo and Soy Komo Soy, next in my list. Will keep posting reviews. I am not a food expert and will learn more about intricacies of ramen.

If you choose Miso Pork Ramen and out of 3, choose the “rich” option for broth, you should get a deliciously umami bowl of ramen.

Not the most authentic ramen in my opinion, but one of the best ramen I have had in India.

The highlight was the pork meat for me. It was nice and chewy with a lot of flavour. Little sweetness to it but not overpowering.

The dashi broth was delicious. Even after finishing up the veggies, meat and the noodles, solely broth had enough flavour to keep me hooked. It did have little after taste of black pepper and the heat which you will feel on the edges of your lips after a few bites. But still I will not call this broth as spicy.

Nitpickings:
They use the disposable generic chopsticks, which have splinter problems sometimes, and are short in length, compared to the depth of the bowl. So it’s a little difficult to use them at the end of your meal. I like to use chopsticks only at asian places, so just my review. They could use the metal chopsticks which would be long, sturdy and reusable.
I wish they had the option to order extra noodles or broth.

Bad:
For the price, they have very average beverage. This time I ordered a cold coffee (₹350). It tasted like the coffee that I used to have in college in my canteen for ₹40. It didn’t taste bad per se but for its price and the type of place, you have a lot better expectations.",16,1758694695.0,pune,15,0.94,False

I’ve been comparing the more premium veneer options which are well within my budget, vs some of the affordable solid wood options which are just within my budget. Everything I’ve been looking at is from reputable companies with sound reviews. Self assembly vs delivered assembled isn’t a deciding factor for me.

I’m debating a few options:

a) Buy everything in premium veneer, save cash, spend it elsewhere (garden for example). 

b) Buy only higher wear items (such as dining table & coffee table) in solid wood for durability, but buy lower wear items (such as tv unit) in premium veneer.

c) Stretch the budget, buy everything in solid wood for piece of mind, but have much less to spend elsewhere (garden etc).
