Whether you’re a freshman, transfer student, or returning Titan, preparation is key to a smooth transition. The following guide outlines essential steps for move-in, academics, campus life, and personal well-being.

## 1. Prepare for Move-In

Bring only what you’ll use at least once a month. Overpacking will make your space cramped and harder to maintain.  Essentials include:

* Laptop or desktop computer
* One fan per room
* Laundry supplies
* Toiletries
* Backpack or messenger bag
* Clothing with hangers
* Water bottle
* Basic school supplies (notebooks, folders, pens/pencils)
* Sturdy U-lock and chain if bringing a bike

Avoid bringing alcohol, drugs, paraphernalia, or anything prohibited in residence halls.

Tips:

* Wear closed-toe shoes and light clothing during move-in.
* Follow your assigned check-in time and instructions.
* Keep your school and state ID with you at all times.
* Check your CSUF email regularly for updates from Housing.

## 2. Build Your Network

A strong support system improves your college experience and academic success.  Ways to connect:

* Help others during move-in.
* Leave your door open when available.
* Introduce yourself to classmates and exchange contact info.
* Study in shared spaces or local coffee shops.
* Attend campus events during Welcome Week.

Social media can help you stay informed about group activities, but use it in moderation.

## 3. Finalize Housing and Class Logistics

* Know and adhere to the student [Housing Policies](https://www.fullerton.edu/housing//residential-engagement/housing-policies.html).
* Review your class schedule and locate your classrooms before the first day.
* Read each syllabus carefully and note important deadlines in your calendar.
* Acquire required materials promptly, as some courses require immediate participation tools like clickers.
* Clarify electronics policies with instructors.

## 4. Share Your Space Effectively

Communicate openly with your roommate(s) about:

* Sleep and class schedules
* Cleaning expectations
* Guest policies
* Allergies or medical needs

Maintain hygiene and cleanliness to prevent conflict.

## 5. Commit to Class Attendance

Regular attendance directly impacts grades. Create a daily routine that includes time for study, meals, and breaks. Use move-in week to practice your commute and test your schedule.

## 6. Balance Academics with Fun

 Enjoy campus life while keeping academics a priority. Explore activities such as:

* Recreation center classes
* Outdoor adventures
* Trips to the beach
* Trips to Disneyland
* Student government
* Concerts and cultural events

## 7. Adjust as Needed

If you’re overwhelmed, consider reducing your course load while staying above 12 credits for full-time status. Protect your GPA!  Early semesters set the tone for your academic record.

Key [academic dates](https://www.fullerton.edu/titan-hub/key-dates-and-deadlines/index.html):

* 23 Aug: First day of classes
* 31 Aug: Waitlist deadline
* 9 Sep: Last day to add class
* 10 Sep: Last day to drop without a “W”
* 14 Nov: Last day to drop with a “W”
* 12 Dec: Last day of classes
* 13-19 Dec: Final exams

## 8. Plan Your Academic Path

Work with an advisor to meet major requirements and stay on track for graduation. Consider future goals (graduate school, competitive careers, or academic honors) and maintain the GPA necessary for them.

## 9. Use Campus Resources

If you feel lost, stressed, or isolated, CSUF offers support:

* [Counseling and Psychological Services](https://www.fullerton.edu/caps/) (CAPS): Free walk-in counseling
* [Advocacy Services](https://www.fullerton.edu/titanthrive/advocacy/index.html): Emotional support and referrals
* [Housing and Residential Engagement](https://www.fullerton.edu/housing//residential-engagement/): RAs can help with the transition to university

## 10. Enjoy the Experience

College is a unique opportunity for growth, learning, and connection. Balance hard work with memorable experiences, and make the most of your time as a Titan.",1,1754874370.0,csuf,0,1.0,False

1mmzh9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1mmzh9h/i_dont_even_know_what_to_think_about_us/,I don’t even know what to think about us,"We actually never really spoke. Until March? We started speaking briefly and bonded over things like our curly hair, and men trying to help us lift weights, surface level stuff. She approached me after a guy tried to ‘help’ me with a weight. Then I mentioned I never realized she had curly hair (like me) cause it was always straightened. She started asking me, every time she saw me, how marathon training was going. She was nice! We had been seeing each other around but not “friends”.

One day I was visibly upset (I had injured myself), she was super supportive of me, told me exactly what I needed to hear, she hugged me twice around my waist (I was up high on the exercise bike so it made sense but still), asked for my number, and by 8am the next morning (11 hours later) she had sent this LONG list of foods and how they could help me heal (she’s a nutrition coach). We continued the text conversation that morning with nothing but positivity, talking about our outlooks on life. I told her I work in nutrition (she’s a nutrition coach) and we bonded over that and manifesting and ‘having no regrets’ and ‘trusting life’s journey’. We hyped each other up so much, it was instant connection with paragraph text messages and emojis and hearts. It felt like we were best friends instantly. Whenever we talked she’d say “that’s like the 50 millionth thing we have in common!”

For 5 weeks, we talked about everything. We’re literally the same person. 

We both worked at a yoga studio, both like reiki, both cook pasta with chicken broth for extra protein. We have the same outlook on nutrition which is… less common than I initially thought, so it was so important to me. I told her all about my job and how people I work with are crazy and she’d tell me about her clients and we both agree on why certain things are good for you, and why some methods are bad. She recommended a nutrition program to me that I’m doing now, I actually told her I found it a while ago and thought it would be a waste of time, but I actually loved it so much and it was teaching me everything I was missing. She was so supportive when I lost my job. She sent me voice memos when I asked her for interview advice. She was excited for me to work at the gym. She coaches at my gym and I want to be a coach so bad, I told her I started the same CPT certification as her but I never finished it. She said ‘don’t worry about that it took me 4 years to get my nutrition certification etc. 

We both grew up dancing and we like the same old 90s/early 00’s bands. We’re the same size in clothes and we bond over the same issues with finding clothes that fit our body type, and managing curly hair. We have the same spiritual views, but she’s Jewish and I’m not. Though, I went to Amsterdam later, I asked her for recommendations and she said “the Anne Frank house was a bucket list item for me, I don’t know if you know the story” and I told her that I played her in 8th grade and the experience really affected me. I said I couldn’t imagine how powerful it was for her and she just, said it was unreal.

We met our partners and moved in similar ways and timelines (both quickly, after a month, due to our leases ending — though she’s older than me so this wasn’t happening at the same time, it actually happened when we were about the same age?! Like when she was younger.) We both said ‘it just felt natural’. But we also have the same issues in our relationships that we vent to each other abut — our partners not listening to our nutrition advice, not being interested in the same things were interested in, feeling like… we have different passions and driving motivations. Feeling like we have to manage the household.

We both take on too many responsibilities and can’t say no to things and we both get so excited, and we make things happen for ourselves. We just… get each other like no one has ever gotten me before. We both help others and never take our own advice. We’re both into manifesting, having no regrets, and believing that things happen for a reason and every opportunity brings us something. We protect our emotions similarly. She said “I learned a long time ago that it’s always a choice to go negative or positive and going negative is just not worth the mental anguish it brings and when there’s a choice for positivity there’s no reason to not choose that. And at a certain point it just became my natural state. It takes A LOT to make me angry or upset lol”

I said “Same that was my early 20s haha. Over time I just learned to accept what’s happening and stay on the surface and chill. People sometimes expect more or don’t trust my response, but I’m like nope that’s really it I promise! Haha but it can be frustrating when people don’t accept or respect what I say, I’m really sensitive to people thinking I’m being dishonest. I never get angry, just anxious sometimes haha.”

She said “I definitely have my sensitive and anxious moments too for sure. It’s hard out there sometimes hahah. Over the years tho I’ve found more and more that it’s easier to just do me and everyone else can deal lol”

I learned her best friend committed suicide at 18, she just causally told me while cleaning after class one day, she moved all over for several years after that, switched schools like 3 times. We were talking about nutrition stuff and she just started taking about body image and her mothers negative self-worth and body image growing up and how it shaped her and how she decided to never be like that. After she watched her struggle her whole childhood, it really affected her and she decided to never make herself feel small. She said ‘that’s not natural for me, I’m always learning, growing, and striving for more. I told her how my mom died and that I was only 6, I even made a joke about it which I never do.

She taught my birthday class at the gym and made the whole thing about me, asked me how I felt to be 28, said happy birthday like 10 times. She’s never done that for any other members. She’s a professional person she takes her job and role seriously. She was beaming looking at me, like, I’ve never seen her more emotional about a ‘client’. She invited me out for drinks for my birthday after like 1-2 text conversations. And that day in class she excitedly asked me in person if we were still going.

We went out that night and talked for 4 hours, only got up once to get a second glass of wine. And we didn’t even notice the time pass or that the bar was empty when we got there, and then full when we left. She literally cried telling me about her first client, and she recalled an offhand comment I made to her about how her nutrition suggestion helped me, she said it meant so much to her. She told me she had so much fun, that we were “real friends” now, to text her any time, and that talking to me just felt so natural, she loved my company when I stayed to talk after class with her. I told her I’m so happy our paths crossed. I’ve never spent 4 hours with a stranger and not had one awkward silence, one moment where we checked our phones. I’ve never spent 4 hours with a stranger period. 

She’d text me about random little things, text me from her family events and holidays, and while she was helping her dad at his office. She was sharing her life with me… She told me she ran 1.5 miles without stopping. Asked for restaurant recommendations and clothing recommendations.

She invited me to yoga class like 3 times. And to get coffee. When we got drinks she said the place was cute and I said ‘it’s a good date night spot you should take your husband here’ and she said ‘yeah well we’re on a cute friend date right now :)’. Then after yoga class she said she wanted to ‘have a cute coffee date with me’.

When we got coffee she mentioned how I said I was upset with my boyfriend. I asked if she ever had feelings for anyone since she got together with her husband. She thought about it, and said “no, but sometimes I think about how things would be different with past partners or if I had made different choices or said different things”. I said “it’s not like I wanna be attached at the hip but I want to feel valued and respected and have some stuff in common that we both enjoy” or something along those lines. And I asked if it bothered her that her husband was so different from her (at the time I knew her as a super confident friendly vibrant loving woman, I knew she went out for a happy hour at our gym recently, she invited me out. She seemed social. I had NO IDEA she wasn’t actually like that in the rest of her life / no one else knew her to be that way). She just brushed it off she said ‘he prefers to be home’. I asked how she felt that he never went to one of her workout classes, she kinda just said ‘he prefers to workout with me at home, he doesn’t like the social classes or working out around people’. But, she thrives there. She didn’t really give me any advice at all. She said “I’m no relationship expert”. But she’s married, and one of the first things she asked me was if she thought I was going to marry my boyfriend (cause I turned 28 and she said ‘what was I doing at 28… oh yeah well I got married). So basically I said “the person is unavailable so I’m framing it as ‘what is this situation trying to tell me about myself and my relationship’” and she hugged me and we were all good.

So I went to London to run the marathon, I told her how much she helped me get through training. She texted me to say she would track me and text me while I was running. Also, the weeks leading up to and even AFTER she would call me out on the mic in front of the entire class “everyone cheer for Jamie she’s running the London Marathon!!!” “this workout is nothing for you Jamie you just ran a marathon” “how do you make 10mph look so effortless”. She never calls anyone out on the mic, never uses anyones name but me.

When I went to Europe for 2 weeks she stopped texting me first…. I missed her but I assume it was just the time difference and her leaving me alone on vacation. But we did chat while I was away. I told her I met a guy at the marathon expo by chance and we had this conversation that just stuck out to me as important. She had the same experience when she worked in Israel teaching kids, sheet a guy and it stuck with her so she got a tattoo of something he said. That’s so perfect. We both recognize and appreciate those little moments.

When I came back she hugged me right away, and that was the last time she hugged me. Which is weird cause she always used to hug me.

The next day I was out at a bachelorette dinner and I sent her this instagram horoscope post that said “do hot yoga with someone hot” and I said “guess I have to come back to yoga with you”. She had just asked me if I was going to get another pass for her yoga studio, where we went to class together a few times, so it was a joke cause it was my horoscope. She’s called me pretty in front of people at the gym before. She’s noticed when I fix my eyebrows and said they looked good, she compliments my hair (I also complement hers). She complements my clothes, my HEART HAIR TIE, how graceful I am when I run. Lots of stuff. She grabbed my necklace off my chest once, which I would have never thought to do to her. I never initiated a single hug or anything physical. I told her, after she expressed interest, that she could totally be a model. But I swear on my life I never said ANYTHING else about her appearance or ANYTHING physical, I just reciprocated when she initiated. She’d hug me when I came into the gym, when I left, when we left yoga class together, anything.

Then things got weird. I didn’t really notice anything until maybe a week or two later? We were texting back and forth and she said she finally had Friday afternoon through Sunday off. I said “great so you’re coming out with me Friday!” And she just stopped replying. She’s never done that. She texted me the next morning, right before I was supposed to see her, saying she’s getting dinner with her parents. But she just said she had no plans.. She’d never waited that long to text me, it was like 18 hours so it wouldn’t be weird except for the fact that we were in the middle of a conversation so it was weird she just stoped replying? And she didn’t mention dinner before, she said she was free.

After class the next day, I asked her if everything was okay, and she said “Why? Cause I’m getting dinner with my parents” it was, kinda a weird tone. I said “no…” she said “cause I couldn’t go out with you?” And I said “no just…” I didn’t even know what to say it was so awkward. She was like “I mean we can still get a drink it’s just you know how my mom is I’m waiting to see if she wants to go and at what time”. I said “yeah I get it” and she asked ME if *I* was ok! And then she goes “how are things with your boyfriend?” I was shocked. I said “not great but that has nothing to do with this…” I couldn’t even look at her. She changed the subject and we ended up talking for 35 minutes totally normally after that. Texting too. It was bugging me so I texted her “why’d you ask about my boyfriend?” she said “just making conversation!” This girl has never once even said the word boyfriend to me.

So I said “sorry it’s just a stressful topic and also the timing was really random?” And she said “I’m sorry I didn’t mean to bring up a stressful topic!”

So I said “are you sure everything’s okay?” (we were also texting about other stuff like simultaneously) but she took THREE DAYS to reply to that. I thought she hated me. She’s NEVER taken that long. She used to send me 1:30 min long voice memos when she was driving just to reply to my texts. Anyway she sends me this long emoji filled paragraph about ‘adulthood being one challenge after another and she’s learning to manager her stress and emotions and it’s just another opportunity to learn and grow’ I was like… okay and I played it off and things were quiet but normal?

So over the next few weeks we’d talk in person like nothing was out of the ordinary. She’d mention she was free all weekend cause she switched her schedule so she has Friday afternoon - Sunday off. Before she was saying how once she was off she could come to class with me instead of teach, and we could go out or go to the sauna. So I asked her the next Friday if she wanted to go out and she said no again. It was like a “aw thanks for the invite I’d love to go but I’m beat from this week so I think I’m gonna chill at home!” I tried for 2 more weeks of this genuinely thinking yeah, she has 4 jobs she’s probably enjoying her rest for the first time in forever.

I asked her directly if she was avoiding me and she said “absolutely not” a few times, like I genuinely believe her. I asked if I did anything, I said, “I feel like you’re the kind of person who would tell me if I did something” and she again just kept saying yeah absolutely. She said something like “if I’m avoiding you it’s cause of my own stuff not because of you”. She asked me again if I was okay and she said she was here for me if I wasn’t okay. So a few hours later I texted her and I said “looks like it’ll be nice tonight I was gonna walk downtown and hang out for a bit, you should come! I always need a distraction when life gets lifey” (a phrase she used when I asked her if she was okay) and she said no again. Not ‘no, I’m busy’, just ‘no I’m gonna stay home’. So I text her “I just want to spend time with people who are important to me before I leave, if you don’t want to I understand”. I’m moving across the country for grad school, she knew I applied but I was going to tell here where I decided to go in person, but she was acting weird. I just wanted to explain why I wanted to see her. Though, I only asked 4 times in one month, once a week, because she kept giving me the “maybe another time!” And “I would honestly love to but…”

Her texts and questions were insanely short, nothing like her, no paragraphs, no emojis. I was expecting some long story or advice from when she moved across the country for school, but I got no emotion. Expecting her to talk about when she went to visit her brother there when she lived in CA, nothing. Mostly expecting her to say ‘tell me everything about the program!!’ Because we bonded over our work!!!

I said I was shocked at how much I’ll miss being here, it’s hitting me, and she said “you’re lucky you’ll have things you’ll miss” I said I was scared and she said “don’t be scared” nothing about life or positivity or embracing change. She said congratulations, but it wasn’t… enthusiastic. She said “when do you leave?” Like she was my dad asking what time I’m coming to his house, or my boss asking me what time I’m coming into work.

I told her I’d miss her. She said absolutely nothing about missing me back.

So at this point I’m frustrated cause she’s looking at me telling me I didn’t do anything and she’s not avoiding me but she refuses to see me outside the gym? And we kinda stopped texting as much. We had a few text exchanges where I was like trying to ask her if everything was good and she was getting a little snippy and like insisting that she just wanted to be home and rest and she was insanely busy with work. But I know a least her one job she got a whole day off, she was texting me telling me she was so happy to cut her teaching schedule back. She keeps saying she prefers to focus on family and be home with her husband and she spends a lot of time with both her family and his. She’s never mentioned any friends, I don’t think she has any good close friends.

One day at the gym were talking about the cape (beach in MA). A girl working there asked if I was running any races and I said I was running one on the cape with my coworkers and we had entered the lottery and were super excited for it. I said I haven’t spent a lot of time there, except when my friends took me to Ptown (on the cape) once and didn’t tell me what it was (it’s the biggest gay town in the country). She, in front of coworkers, inserted herself into the conversation, said ‘I always wanted to go to pride there!’ She said she wanted to go to that one and one in Israel. I was talking about running a race on the cape, at my gym, to a girl at the front desk, she interjected into my conversation with this other girl and while I did bring up Ptown, she interjected with the pride comment.

I asked 2 girls I know who work with her for their input. They both don’t think anything’s wrong, I told one of them how she didn’t text me back and she said “oh she’s much better in person” but she texts me everyday? She used to text me first? She’s never taken that long to reply. Another girl, I told more of the story too, I asked how well she knew her and she said “not well, she’s a homebody, we got coffee once” she said “give her some space” both girls said she’s a private, professional person. But she was never like that with me? She invited a complete stranger (me) out on a Wednesday night for me BIRTHDAY. I had no idea. When we met she treated me completely differently, it was like she didn’t have anyone else to talk to…

So, present day, things are getting worse. I keep saying “are you sure everything’s okay?” And she said “there’s nothing weird on my end the only thing weird is you making it weird when you keep asking me what’s weird”. She’s really emphasizing her home life with her husband and their responsibilities. I said “sorry I was just hurt that you didn’t want to hang out for a few weeks, I should’ve just said that instead of making you feel like I was questioning your schedule”.

So I’m thinking she’s trying to backtrack our friendship like she didn’t actually want to be friends outside the gym or she doesn’t have the mental or emotional bandwidth or capacity. So I said “I must’ve misread things, you seemed really excited before, and I was happy to have a friend I connect with and look up to” and she said “you didn’t misread anything, I really am just tired”.

So at this point I’m like whatever, I walk into the gym and don’t even say hi to her. She spends the next 3 days, 6 hours of classes, approaching me, flirting with me. She immediately came up to me, excited that I applied for a job at the gym. I didn’t tell her because they weren’t hiring at the time, I’m sure her coworker told her about it she wasn’t prying or anything, but still, if she wanted space from me why is she coming up to me telling me “omg you’re gonna work here and then you can be a coach!!” And she also asked me tons of in depth questions about my running, she usually asks “oh what are you working on” but she was like, prolonging the conversation asking what pace I’m running, what my strategy is. She also spent an additional 10 minutes telling me I inspired her to go to grad school (she’s never mentioned grad school, she said she was happy with her life as is). She’s asking me about prerequisites and saying she wants to be an RD (that’s what I’m in school for). But… she doesn’t want to hang out with me? But she’s approaching me. This, by the way, is DURING her class, while she’s working, she’s talking to me instead of focusing on the class. I was barely looking at her but I smiled when she walked by and she goes “are you laughing at me” in the flirtiest tone I’ve ever heard? I smiled big and said “usually!”. She must’ve been watching me cause she made fun of me when my foot got caught in a weight.

So she does not want to see me outside of the gym but she can tell her I inspired her to make a major life decision and celebrate me potentially working with her?!

After 3 days of this I walked outside with her and I said “why are you doing this to me” and she said “doing what”. I said “every other person I told I was moving immediately wanted to spend time with me this summer and you’re the person I talk to most and you don’t even wanna see me”. She just said the same ‘busy’ excuse and said she’d see me at the gym. I said “yeah, but that’s not the same thing”. She said she’d show me her schedule…

I said I was going to miss her. At some point during this… I swear she almost cried. My mouth said the words “why are you sad” before my brain even registered it. She said “I’m not sad I’m just trying to eat my snack” she practically spit out her granola bar at me. I don’t remember what I said but she then asked me if I was crying.

Then she took a step back and said “I think I know what’s going on but I don’t want to embarrass you” I looked away immediately… Then she made an excuse to go back inside, a lie, and I knew it, but whatever.

So I texted her “what did you mean embarrass me?” And she replied “I’m sorry that I’m so busy with work and don’t really have time to hangout, I barely have the time/energy to even do my own workouts lately. And when I’m not busy I like my down time/alone time/hanging out with family. I’m good tho and there’s nothing weird coming from me but there’s clearly something bothering you and idk what. And I’m really sorry I don’t mean to sound rude but I’d appreciate it if you would stop pulling me aside for these conversations that go nowhere and pull me away from working and frankly make me uncomfortable.”

[[[Side Note: I only pulled her aside for that conversation, and the week before when I asked if she was avoiding me. And she just.. like.. I told her she could talk to me, but she didn’t really say much, and I guess neither did I, but I was asking direct questions of her. She keeps saying “if you have something to say to me you can say it”. But… I’ve told her how felt, I’m leaving and she’s my friend. I guess what I really want to know is why she’s using work and family, something that always was important to her throughout our entire friendship and before, to explain a major shift in her behavior. She’ll text me back like normal when we talk about every other topic, but not our friendship.]]]

So when we met she liked all my stories and posts on instagram and watched all my stories. After I got back from Europe she started watching less and less of them. Until she stopped. Except after she sent that text, she watched my story. I didn’t reply and I posted the story after she sent the text. Then I replied “I think I understand” and she didn’t say anything but she watched my next story after that too.

[[[Side Note: She told me she’s not a social media person, she has virtually no followers/following and she never posts stories. She only posted one story right after I followed her that’s it. She also tried on my clothes once and we were talking about it and I made a joke that she doesn’t like to show off and she said “no I’m very modest!” Oh yeah she told me she tried on my clothes in front of her husband and told him how amazing I was for letting her borrow them so she could check her size.]]]

I sent another text a few days later just asking her to be 100% honest with me because I started getting a little worried that she was in trouble, either with her husband / family dynamic or something serious was going on and I just got scared so I reached out again. I said something like ""can you just be 100% honest with me I'm sorry I'm just so confused"" and she said ""We hung out a few times and then my schedule got crazy again because it always goes up and down and I didn’t/don’t have much free time or energy to hangout/go out and you took offense to that, that’s all.""

She also took like 2 days I think to even reply to that message? I wasn’t expecting her to even reply at that point.

I came into her class on Wednesday after the text and we were both actively avoiding eye contact. I could tell cause I saw her in the mirrors, as I am assuming she was also watching for me in the mirrors.

After I walked up to her while she was cleaning treadmill screens, I said ‘hi’ she said ‘hi’ too, and she glanced at me but didn’t really stop cleaning, but we were both smiling. She asked what’s up and I said “what did you mean when you said you didn’t want to embarrass me?”  She said “Jamie I don’t know what else to tell you, I don’t know why I said it. I said “it’s just a weird comment to make and then not be able to explain what you meant by it” and she said “maybe I said it cause I’m tired and I’m at work”. I just froze. Like I was mad at myself during this conversation for not speaking more, but she was nervously talking to fill the silence. She would kinda look at me but mostly avoid eye contact and she was rushing all over the room like she was so nervous I’ve never seen her behave that way. She usually takes extra long to clean, she stops all the time when we’re talking to think or look at me. Not this time she was switching from task to task like crazy. She just kept talking about how she was “busy with work and her husband” and she said “I’m at a point in my life where I just work all the time and go home and” (I forget she said rest, chill, spend time with my husband, do family obligations). She said one comment about all the stuff she was doing and I said “that sounds really hard” and she said “yeah it is”.

She walked outside to get the mop bucket and she held the door for me, as if to continue the conversation (but remember she said these conversations make her uncomfortable). I won’t say she looked comfortable, but she was almost, trying me, like, she didn’t have a shaky or sad or annoyed voice she had… a knowing voice. She just kept repeating “Jamie I don’t know what you want from me” or “Jamie I don’t know what to tell you”. Also she went from calling Ben (her husband) ‘Ben’ to me, and started calling him ‘my husband’. Also she’s never used my name to address me ever, only when talking about me.

When she bent down to get the bucket I said “I know what you’re doing” and she said “what am I doing?” WITH A SMILE. I couldn’t say anything there were people down the hallway. So she re-launched into her ‘work and family’ excuses.

I followed her back in and I said “you’re being evasive!” And she was like ‘no I’m not’ or something and kept repeating more of the other phrases she was using. She said “Jamie if you have something to say to me just say it I’m listening” but I didn’t say anything… When it was time to leave we started a long conversation with the woman at the front desk. Then she got on the computer (I’ve NEVER seen a coach use the computer) and said she forgot to do something the head coach asked them to do because they ‘wouldn’t have access to an app’ they use. Definitely an excuse to not come outside with me where we would be alone. I aways walk out with them.

Friday, 2 days later, I came in, things were a little different, she didn’t say anything to me during class which was weird. I told her a few things, I made a joke about my coworker being in class with a guy who works there and being nervous, she laughed. Later I said “I’m impressed you’re such a good coach even though I make you nervous” and she just smiled and said “yeah well it’s my job” I said “I know and you’re really good at it” and she was smiling the entire time. She said she ‘had to go into the office to do a training with Kate’ pulled open the door, looked at me again and said “I don’t know why you’re looking at me like that” and I smiled and said “yeah you do” and turned around and left. (Kate works at the front desk so I don’t know what trainings they would be ‘doing together’.)

She texted me 40 minutes later. She hasn’t texted me first in 2 months. “Hey. I’d like to reiterate that I never said you make me nervous, I said you make me uncomfortable. Big difference. When I’m at work I am working and have stuff that I need to do and I’d appreciate it if you would just let me do my job.”

I said “You’re right I’m sorry it’s not funny. Leah can we please talk? There’s something I need to say but I’m scared to do it at the gym or over text. Please? It’s important to me.”

She said “I would really rather not I’m sorry”

I said “I didn’t realize… it was 10000% a joke and I’m so sorry. I can’t go back there or see you in class and not talk to you and not be your friend, it’s too hard for me. Can we at least say goodbye?”

She said “I don’t think that’s necessary”

I said “Not necessary?”

She said “I don’t think we need a big goodbye. We only hung out a couple times.”

I said “You know that’s not true”

She said “Ok this is done. Please leave me alone.”

The next morning I said “Leah I didn’t know how you felt until 3 days ago I swear I had no idea”

IMMEDIATELY before I could even type another text she sent “I’ve been telling you for over a week how you make me uncomfortable and to leave me alone at work and to leave me alone period and you just don’t seem to get it. I really hate having to be mean but you are not listening. Please leave me alone. I’m blocking your number.”

She blocked my number but she just unfollowed me on Instagram, didn’t block me. She removed me as a follower from her too.

Keep in mind this is instant responses. Like 0.2 seconds. One right after another.











So. We didn’t see each other for 10 days. I saw her at the gym one morning when she was leaving and I was coming into the next class. She completely avoided even turning her body toward me or looking at me. So I went outside and the first thing that came out of my mouth was “you weren’t gonna say goodbye?!” She was like “….I just waved and said goodbye to everyone” and I said “I don’t mean today. I mean ever.” She said “I wasn’t planning anything…”

I forget exactly what happened and in what order but we talked for like 5-10 minutes? I said “so that’s it? like ever?” and she said “I figured I’d see you around the gym…” And she was like “look, we hung out a couple times and you kinda latched on and it started making me uncomfortable, and I felt like you weren’t listening to me” so I said “okay, well I asked you if I did anything, I asked if you were avoiding me, you said absolutely not to both of those things, so why didn’t you just say that then? When I asked you? It would have been okay,” and she just said “I felt like I did say that”. So I said “I told you ‘I’m sorry I must’ve misread things like your intentions and our friendship and you told me I didn’t, like why would you say that?” And she literally had no answer. I asked “why did you keep telling me to ‘say it’ if you weren’t going to talk to me about it” and she was like… she didn’t have an answer. 

She also said “I don’t know what you want from me” and I said “I don’t know what you want from me!!” And I was like “nothing? Ever?”

The whole time her eyes were pretty wide, and her answers were.. like her voice was very small. She wasn’t angry, she wasn’t smiling like she used to smile when I confronted her, it was…. Maybe a little defeated, sad, tired, exposed. She looked like… she looked like someone who was rejected. I just wanted to reach out and hug her. She still wasn’t giving any real answers, that’s why I can’t really recall it all, she just said “I don’t know” or something like that a few times. She said something like “I felt like I did say it but you weren’t listening” at one point. She also said something “I just needed it to stop”.



7 days later. I went to her class. and she didn’t know I was coming and she smiled IMMEDIATELY when she saw me, and said “hi how are you doing?!” Like the biggest smile. Different from her recently avoiding eye contact when I walk in… So I went up to her after class and I said “you keep asking me what I want from you, but I think you know” and she said “no I don’t know cause I’m not a mind reader” and then I said “I just want things to go back to normal” and then she said “what does that mean?” I said “we both know that there’s something that we’re not saying and I don’t want to keep doing this anymore. She said “yeah me neither I don’t want to keep doing this”. I said “I’m leaving in six weeks and I really miss you.” She was like… “I see you in class” and I said ‘you know that’s not the same” 

We had this long back and forth for like 25 minutes. She kept saying I was making her uncomfortable. So I asked her “why? cause I asked you how you were doing? I was worried about you, you seem really stressed. I wanted to make sure you were okay, I want you to know someone cares about you, and I just want you to be happy” and she was like “that’s really sweet but I’m fine. I’m not like depressed or suicidal. I just have normal adult stress”. Her eyes were really red like she was about to cry. The same look as before. I said something like “I really miss you Leah” and she said “you’re going to grad school, you should be excited, you shouldn’t be sitting here worrying about me” and I just looked at her… I opened my mouth to speak and I just said “yeah but…” And then I just looked away…

She said I was harassing her. And I literally laughed and said “harassing you?!” And she said “not like criminally but you’re holding me hostage for these conversations and I just want to go home”. She used her ‘I caught you in a lie’ voice where you could hear the smile in her voice as she was speaking and she was clearly making up words as she was going. It was not someone who was mad at me. It sounded like someone enjoying the intensity of the conversation. 

We were AT her car with the DOOR OPEN. She kept saying that she wanted to go home, she said “can you please just let me go home”. But she didn’t make a move to leave. So we kept talking and ‘arguing’ about basically she was saying I was making her uncomfortable, and I was like laughing at this point like “okay, can you tell me what I did/said to make you uncomfortable? Like what did I do?” And I stepped towards her when I asked that and she didn’t step away and she never stopped looking into my eyes the entire time. This whole conversation. And she didn’t have an answer other than how I was ‘pulling her aside for these conversations’ so I said ‘well I only did that cause I was worried about you and I was trying to understand’ and this entire conversation for like 5 minutes we were both like… SMILING?? I said “so you basically can’t tell me what it is that I did that made you uncomfortable” and she was like I just wanna go home. I’m tired. I had a long day. I have a husband and a dog and I worked all three jobs today.

We had this crazy back-and-forth where we were both kind of like smiling at each other and she was like “you got really intense and you got really interested in me and it made me uncomfortable” and I just laughed and it went on again and again. I kept saying “no” “I don’t think that’s it” “there’s something you’re not telling me”. She called me out for saying the same thing over and over again, and all these cryptic messages, and I called her out and I said “you’re saying the same thing over and over again with cryptic messages too.” At some point she said something like “it happened and…” (I forget the rest) but I was like “it happened and….. we’re just gonna pretend it never happened?! I wanna talk about it” and she just said “maybe we can talk about it another time”.

So the last thing I said was “I feel the same way as you” and she said “I don’t know what that means” and I said “yes you do know what that means”. And then I almost started crying so I said “please don’t do this to me” and then I walked away.",1,1754874180.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

From the cramped, chaotic confines of my office, a room that was more data archive and caffeine-stained coffee mugs than living space, I watched the victory feeds on a dozen smeared screens. Caelia the Sunstone, smiling. Caelia the Savior, waving. Caelia the Hero, promising a new dawn. It was a beautiful, expertly crafted piece of propaganda, and my job, my entire purpose for existing, was to find the rotten core hidden beneath the varnish.

For fifteen years, I had run ""The Varnish,"" an encrypted news feed that specialized in the stories the Sector News wouldn't touch. I’d published proof of corporate malfeasance that got buried, military blunders that were re-written as strategic sacrifices, and political scandals that were memory-holed. It had earned me a small, loyal following, a permanent place on every government watchlist, and a deeply ingrained cynicism that was almost impossible to penetrate.

My inbox was a constant stream of garbage. Crackpots, conspiracy theorists, and low-level functionaries with petty grudges. I deleted them by the dozen. So when a new message slipped through my layers of security, I was prepared for it to be more of the same. But this one was different. The encryption was amateurish but layered with a desperate kind of cleverness. The subject line alone made me pause.

*Subject: The Real Cost of Cleansing.*

I leaned forward, the cynicism momentarily forgotten, replaced by the familiar, electric thrill of a potential story. I decrypted the message. The text was short, direct. An anonymous source claiming to know the truth behind a trinket given to Caelia during the celebration. It was the kind of vague claim I usually dismissed. But then I saw the attachment. It wasn't a blurry photo or a rambling manifesto. It was an official document. A formal petition to High Command, dated one week before Operation Cleansing.

It was a request for a delay, citing a 7.3% probability of catastrophic power grid failure in the Delta-7 region. It was signed by a Dr. Lysander Kai, Director, Delta-7 Agricultural Sciences Initiative.

Lysander. The name echoed in the vast, dusty archive of my mind. I’d heard it once before, whispered by a source in the Relief Bureau, a man who had spoken of a brilliant, difficult scientist who had ""perished"" in the Delta-7 disaster after making a nuisance of himself with High Command. He was a loose end that had been neatly tied up.

And now, here was his ghost, banging on my door.

This wasn't a conspiracy theory. This was a thread. A single, shimmering thread that, if pulled, could unravel the entire flawless tapestry of Caelia’s victory. The anonymous sender wasn't a crackpot. They were an insider. But I had to be sure. I had to verify.

I composed a reply, routing it through a series of anonymous relays that would make it impossible to trace back to me.

*Subject: Re: The Real Cost of Cleansing*

*Message: Petitions are filed every day. Prove you're more than a ghost. What was Project Chimera's primary nutrient catalyst?*

It was an obscure question, a piece of technical jargon that would have been buried in the project's sub-level data, inaccessible to anyone but the team that had lived and breathed it. If they could answer this, they were real.

I hit send. Then, I turned to the virtual corkboard that dominated the far wall of my office, a messy collage of my ongoing investigations. I created a new file, a clean, empty space in the chaos. I typed out the title: OVERSIGHT. I pinned the digital copy of Lysander’s petition to the board. It looked small and lonely.

But it wouldn't be lonely for long. I could feel it in my bones. The Sunstone cast a long, dark shadow. And something was finally beginning to crawl out of it.",1,1754873925.0,u_whypotato2123,0,1.0,False
1mmzdqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1mmzdqn/is_he_being_friendly_or_flirting/,Is he being friendly or flirting?,"Last summer I did an internship with a few other interns. We were given assigned seats and I was seated across from this one guy. We became friends pretty quickly, as we worked long hours, and would pick up dinner's together, help eachother with problems at work and just talk about whatever throughout the day. From the start we always had a lot of good banter and to this day are always kind of making fun of eachother/teasing.

I never really thought of him as more than a friend last summer, even though there were moments where I felt a little spark, times when he would go out of his way/offer to help me, give me his food if I hadn't had time to order dinner, or a time he got really flustered when a barista at a coffee shop said to him “isn’t she gorgeous.”

It is now a year later though and something feels different. We just started full time at this job, and I find myself feeling attracted to him. We still make playful banter at eachother, but it feels different than before, and I have noticed my girlfriends picking up on how close we are as friends.

A few days ago me, him, and a couple friends went clubbing. I often felt like he was nearby or looking around to check where I was, and when a random guy came up to me to talk to me he was nearby and when I got out of the convo he said “we should’ve had a signal, it would make me so annoyed if someone did that to my girlfriend."" 

Later as we were walking to another bar, random people on the street yelled at us that we should be a couple and we looked great together, and we both immediately awkwardly kinda walked away from eachother and tried to ignore the comment. I have noticed whenever we talk I feel like we end up grazing hands or knees a lot and there is often long eye contact. When we were all grabbing a late night snack he randomly started singing like a love song and my friend and i just looked at eachother like what? idk we were all a little drunk. At the end of the night he texted me ""text me when u are home safe.""

I was diagnosed with T1D 3 years ago, I since gained 30 lbs. 

I've weighted the same my entire adult life, while 30 lbs doesn't seem like a lot, it is for me.

I decided to try counting calories and be on a deficit, I've been on approx. 500 cal deficit a day for the past 4 months, and while the weight gain stopped, I did not lose even half a pound. 

I count EVERYTHING, even the oil in my salad and the almond milk in my coffee. 

I use an app to help me track calories & a smart kitchen scale to be able to count calories based on the exact weight. 

I am never hungry when is summer / hot, there are days I don't even eat 1000 cals a day, most days I stay under 1400, I am 5'6"" by the way. 

I eat a vegetarian diet mainly consisting of vegetables, grains, eggs, cheese, and some grains & fruits. 

It did not make sense to me that I was not loosing any weight whatsoever, because I'm burning more than what I am consuming.

This led me to do some research about how insulin affects weight gain, and I found out that if there is insulin present, our body is prevented from burning fat: insulin makes the route to our fat cells a one-way street: things can go in, but nothing can come out.  
We’re not able to burn any existing reserves until our insulin levels start coming back down about two hours after a glucose spike.

1mmz2iu,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmath/comments/1mmz2iu/i_created_a_formula_to_calculate_if_you_should/,I created a formula to calculate if you should use an umbrella today.,"I wanted a one-number way to decide whether carrying an umbrella is worth it today.   
  
U = E*p*I\*(T/60)*(1 - S)*(1 - R)\*(1 + W) - C  
  
Decision rule: carry the umbrella if U > 0. Skip it if U ≤ 0.

What the letters mean (all between 0 and 1 unless noted)  
p = chance it rains while you’re actually outside (use the hourly rain probability)  
I = expected rain intensity in mm/hour (rough guide: 0.5–1 light drizzle, 2–3 steady, 6–10 thunderstorm, 12–30 torrential)  
T = minutes you’ll be outdoors (door-to-door walking time, not your whole day)  
S = shelter fraction of that time (awnings, covered walkways). 0 means no cover, 0.4 means 40% under cover  
R = clothing resistance to rain. 0 = tee shirt, 0.3 = hoodie, 0.6 = good rain shell  
W = wind penalty. 0 = calm, 0.5 = windy, 1.0 = strong crosswind that defeats umbrellas and hoods  
E = umbrella effectiveness, i.e., how much wetness it prevents. Use 0.85 by default  
C = your annoyance cost for carrying one, in the same “wetness units.” Typical person might be 0.60. If you hate carrying stuff, set C higher; if you don’t mind, set it lower  
  
The big product is your expected wetness exposure without an umbrella. Multiplying by E gives the wetness you would avoid if you carried one. Subtract the hassle cost C. If the avoided wetness beats the hassle, U is positive and you bring it.

If you prefer a threshold instead of computing U  
Solve for the intensity I you’d need to justify carrying:  
I\_threshold = C / \[ E \* p \* (T/60) \* (1 - S) \* (1 - R) \* (1 + W) \]  
If forecast intensity I is above that threshold, bring it.

defaults if you don’t want to think too hard  
  
E = 0.85  
C = 0.60  
R = 0.20 if you’re in a light jacket, 0.60 if you’re in a real rain shell  
W = 0.0 calm, 0.5 windy, 1.0 very windy

Worked examples (these track common sense)  
  
I’ll use E = 0.85 and C = 0.60.

A) Quick coffee run with pop-up drizzle  
p=0.30, I=1, T=8, S=0.40, R=0.30, W=0.10  
U ≈ -0.584 → Don’t carry.  
Short errand, light drizzle, lots of awnings.

B) Summer thunderstorm, 25-minute walk to the train  
p=0.70, I=8, T=25, S=0.10, R=0.10, W=0.50  
U ≈ +1.810 → Carry.  
Long walk, heavy rain, some wind.

C) You’re driving; only a 2-minute dash at destination  
p=0.80, I=4, T=2, S=0.20, R=0.20, W=0.20  
U ≈ -0.530 → Don’t carry.  
Tiny exposure window overwhelms everything else.

D) Windy rain, 20-minute walk home  
p=0.60, I=5, T=20, S=0.00, R=0.20, W=0.80  
U ≈ +0.624 → Carry.  
Wind makes jackets worse and increases the benefit of an umbrella.

Two quick sanity checks

1. How long would Example A need to last to flip to “carry”? About 306 minutes (five hours) of strolling in drizzle. Otherwise not worth it.
2. How intense would Example C have to be for a 2-minute dash? About 34.5 mm/hr (torrential). That’s why short dashes rarely justify an umbrella.

How to use this in practice

1. Plug in the hourly rain probability for the slice of time you’ll be outdoors.
2. Estimate intensity from the forecast icon: light 1, moderate 2–3, heavy 5–8, torrential 12+.
3. Set T to your actual outside minutes.
4. Adjust S, R, and W by feel. You’ll get good at this after a couple of tries.
5. If U > 0, bring it. 

If you hate carrying umbrellas, bump C to 0.8 and you’ll see the threshold rise. If you’re wearing a proper rain shell, set R around 0.6 and watch many borderline cases flip to “don’t carry.” If you’re biking in crosswinds, set W high; the model will often tell you to prefer a jacket over an umbrella.",0,1754873009.0,askmath,0,0.5,False

1mmz1uu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ZealousidealPoem8523/comments/1mmz1uu/how_blockchain_technology_is_quietly_improving/,How Blockchain Technology is Quietly Improving Our Daily Lives,"When most people hear ""blockchain,"" they think of Bitcoin and crypto hype. But beyond the speculation, blockchain technology is making real, practical improvements to our daily lives—often in ways we don’t even notice. Here’s how:  

🔒Better Security & Privacy
Blockchain’s decentralized nature means no single entity controls your data. From secure logins (like decentralized identity verification) to tamper-proof medical records, blockchain reduces fraud and keeps sensitive info out of the wrong hands.  

🌍Transparent Supply Chains
Ever wonder if your coffee is *really* fair trade or if your organic veggies are legit? Companies like IBM and Walmart use blockchain to track products from farm to shelf, ensuring authenticity and ethical sourcing.  

💸Faster, Cheaper Payments
Sending money internationally? Traditional banks take days and charge hefty fees. Blockchain-powered transfers (like USDC or Stellar) settle in seconds for pennies. Even Venmo and PayPal are integrating crypto for smoother transactions.  

🏡 Smart Contracts = Less Bureaucracy  
Renting an apartment? Buying a car? Smart contracts automate agreements without middlemen. No more waiting for lawyers or brokers—just code executing terms automatically when conditions are met.  

🎨Empowering Creators
NFTs got a bad rap, but blockchain helps artists and musicians get paid fairly. Smart contracts ensure royalties on resales, and decentralized platforms cut out exploitative intermediaries.  

⚡Energy & Sustainability
Blockchain optimizes energy grids by enabling peer-to-peer energy trading (think selling solar power to neighbors). Projects like Power Ledger make renewable energy more accessible.  

🚫Fighting Fake News
Some platforms are using blockchain to verify sources and combat deepfakes. Imagine a news article with an immutable record of edits and origins—no more ""trust me bro"" journalism.  

The Bottom Line**  
Blockchain isn’t just about crypto—it’s a foundational tech reshaping finance, privacy, and trust. Sure, there’s noise and scams, but the real-world use cases are undeniable.

The 10oz cup is a versatile ‌and essential item​ found in‍ homes, offices, and cafes alike.Perfect for enjoying ​a moderate serving of coffee, tea, juice, or⁣ even small snacks, it strikes⁤ a balance between too little and too much. In 2025, the ‍market is saturated with options, each boasting different materials, designs, and features. Choosing the ‌right 10oz cup can substantially enhance your daily drinking ‍experience, impacting everything from temperature retention to aesthetic appeal. This review dives into the ⁢leading⁤ brands and models available in 2025,providing a comprehensive guide to help you make an informed decision.

[[Explore Top Rated 10oz cup on Amazon.]](https://site.properlygeek.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=10oz cup)

## Key Features Analysis

The​ modern 10oz cup offers a range of ⁣features that go beyond simple liquid‍ containment. From advanced insulation to ergonomic ‌designs, these features contribute significantly to user satisfaction.

**Material:**​ Cups come in various materials, including ceramic, glass, stainless steel, and plastic.

The ‍Choice of material significantly impacts a cup's durability,heat retention,and overall feel. Ceramic cups are ‍known for their classic aesthetic and ability to maintain temperature relatively well, while‌ glass offers openness and ⁢elegance but can be more fragile. Stainless steel cups excel in durability and ​temperature retention, often featuring⁤ double-walled insulation. Plastic ‌cups are⁣ typically ​lightweight and inexpensive, ⁣but may not be ‌as durable ​or ‌environmentally pleasant. The chosen material also affects the cup's suitability for microwave use.

**Insulation:** Double-walled insulation is a‍ common feature in many high-end 10oz cups.

Double-Walled insulation creates an air gap between the inner and outer layers of the ‌cup, significantly reducing heat transfer. ⁢This keeps hot drinks hot ⁤for longer and cold drinks​ cold for longer. This feature is ‍especially critically important for those ⁢who enjoy savoring their beverages over an extended period or need⁣ to keep their ⁣drinks ⁢at a specific temperature for optimal enjoyment.‌ While some cups use simple air gaps, others employ ‌vacuum insulation providing superior temperature retention.

**Design⁢ and Ergonomics:**⁤ The shape, handle, and overall design of ‍a 10oz cup contribute to ‍its usability and aesthetic appeal.Ergonomic ‌Designs ⁣prioritize user comfort, ​ensuring the cup fits comfortably in your hand and is easy to ​grip. Features like contoured shapes, textured surfaces, and well-positioned ‌handles can enhance the drinking experience. Aesthetically, cups range from sleek and modern to classic and traditional, allowing users to ⁢choose options that match their personal preference and decor.The weight and balance of the cup are also crucial for ⁤pleasant use and reducing the risk of spills.

**Lid Options:** Some 10oz cups come with lids, offering added convenience and⁣ functionality.

Lids Prevent⁣ spills,retain ⁣temperature,and offer added convenience for on-the-go use. Lid designs vary from simple snap-on lids to more sophisticated ‍screw-on lids with⁤ sliding closures. Some lids‌ are designed to be leak-proof, while others focus on‌ easy access for drinking. Materials used in lids range from⁤ plastic ​to silicone, with some‍ featuring⁣ integrated straws or‍ sipping spouts. The lid's‍ compatibility with different ​types of beverages and​ its ease of cleaning are⁣ also important considerations.

**Durability:** A Durable 10oz cup is built to withstand everyday use and potential accidental drops or impacts.

Durability Depends ‍on the quality of materials used and the ‍overall construction of the cup.stainless⁤ steel and high-grade plastic⁣ cups‍ are generally more durable than ceramic or glass, making them suitable for frequent use and travel. Some cups also⁢ feature reinforced bases or impact-resistant coatings ​to further enhance ‍their durability. ​A durable cup not only lasts longer but also ⁣provides peace of mind knowing it can withstand ​the rigors of daily life.

## Core Benefits

A High-quality 10oz cup offers several tangible benefits that can ‍improve your daily routine⁢ and ⁤overall drinking​ experience.

**Enhanced Temperature ‌Retention:** A well-insulated 10oz cup keeps your ⁣coffee hot or your iced tea cold for extended periods. Users‍ report coffee staying hot for up to ‍two⁢ hours ‌longer compared to standard⁤ ceramic mugs.This translates to less frequent reheating and more enjoyable sipping experiences. Double-walled stainless steel options perform exceptionally well in this aspect.**Improved ⁣Portability:** Especially with a lid, a 10oz cup becomes easily transportable. With leak-proof lid options, you‍ can confidently bring your beverage⁤ on your commute, to the office, or on‍ outdoor ⁤adventures without the worry of​ spills. This translates to fewer accidents ​and more convenience, especially ⁤for those with active ​lifestyles.

1mmyvhs,https://youtu.be/hcouSsrNR0k?si=NLC36NsaNpHXSRD2,‘Indiscriminate Shooting’: US Whistleblower Speaks Out on Gaza Aid Sites,"25-year US Army veteran Anthony Aguilar, who worked as a contractor for the US and Israeli-backed so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,” told Zeteo that the project need to be “shut down” and is an “appendage” of the Israeli military and cog in a machine that has deliberately killed hundreds of Palestinians.

In Part 1 of his interview with Zeteo, Aguilar, a former Green Beret and retired lieutenant colonel, revealed that the GHF ‘aid’ sites were “built as death traps” and featured Palestinians trying to survive “indiscriminate” shooting. The GHF project has received at least $30 million in funding from the Trump administration.

Several episodes Aguilar highlighted underscore the actual horrors unfolding at the sites.

Aguilar recounted a young boy named Amir who approached him and another contractor at one of the sites:

“I said to him, ‘you’re not forgotten. The world cares, people care, we care. You’re not alone.’ He probably didn’t understand the words that I was speaking but I think he could probably understand the sentiment…he puts his hands on my cheeks. And his little hands are very emaciated, and the fingernails are dried and brittle. You could tell, like just all of the signs of someone that is starving. All of the signs. I mean, these aren’t things that are made up. That’s not Hamas propaganda. Saw it, touched it. And he puts his hands on my face and he kisses me on the lips and he says, ‘Thank you’ in English.”

Soon thereafter, bullets from the Israeli military started flying.

“Palestinians started dropping to the ground, and Amir was amongst them. So this young boy that traveled eight kilometers, eight or nine kilometers, from his home to get aid, a very small amount of aid, thanks us. Gratitude. And ends up dead.”

Watch the full interview above to hear Anthony Aguilar lay out in painful detail the violence he saw inflicted upon Palestinians, the dysfunction and chaos of the so-called “Gaza Humanitarian Foundation,” and much, much more.

1mmykp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mmykp3/am_i_the_creep_got_rejected_by_barista_should_i/,"Am I the Creep? Got “Rejected” by barista, should I stop going to the coffee place?","I (33M) gave my cell number with a short note Lunch? Dinner? Coffee? on a piece of paper folded up to a barista at a drive up coffee establishment. She didn’t text or call and I’ve been back a few times but she seems very distant and almost tries to hide. Should I stop going to the coffee place? That’s the short version I’ll give more background now. 

TLDR version - 

I started going to this coffee place about 12 months ago and ended up a couple times talking to this really pretty lady. I would imagine that she’s about 25-27 but tries to dress younger, but I’m pretty sure she’s mid to late 20s. I might be wrong. She’s a very outgoing and fun lady asking questions trying to be very customer service oriented. She is trying to get customers hooked and she hooked me like a big dumb fish. I understand she was 95% being nice because she wanted the business to do well and get good tips and get me to come back. We talked a few times and she would share with me and I would share with her. I finally learned her name, let’s just call her “A”. After 2-3 decent conversations through the drive through she was gone for 3 weeks. So I thought she quit, nope she went to help open another store so she talked to me about that shortly and over a couple more conversations through the drive thru window she asked what I did. I have progressed through my career quickly, I became a manager of a company at 26 and took on a lot of responsibility. I’m stressed quite a bit and work long hours so I look to be late 30s. I’m a big guy, might be on the verge of obese but I’m overall just big, forearms beard etc. I probably look 40 and with what I told her I do as far as management and being an Agronomist she probably thinks I’m 5-10 years older than I actually am. She said “wow I would love to learn more about that” and told her how I grew up in a small town of 1200 people and she was dumbfounded and said “that is so crazy I bet you have some stories”. Well she went on another work trip and was gone for another 2-3 weeks. So I saw she was working after the brief break and I wrote my name, phone number, and a choice of Lunch, Dinner, Coffee? I then folded up the paper and as she gave me the coffee I handed her the note and she smiled and I drove off as she was super busy.  Didn’t hear anything from her. Went at a different time of the day that I normally go and she happened to be working so I walked up to the window and she was very cold. Didn’t want to talk and gave me my drink and shut the window. I could have swore that she then told the other two guys “that’s the guy who gave me his number” but I don’t know if it was my mind playing tricks or if it was said I have no way to prove it. We really haven’t talked like we use to and she is nice until there’s some awkward silence and then she will walk away getting someone else to hand me the drink or she’ll pretend to be busy. I haven’t asked about why she didn’t text. I haven’t been weird about not talking with her I smile and either listen to the radio or shoot off a quick text or just hang out not trying to be a weirdo. There was a period of about 6 weeks when I didn’t see her and I asked another worker if “A” still worked there and she said she did but was doing openings at two places and would be back on X date. I said cool sounds good thanks! I didn’t come back on that day but a couple days later and sure enough she was there but mind you I think she went to the back to hide. 

Now here’s the question should I stop frequenting this place? I probably go there 1-2 times a week. And it’s been almost 8-9 months since I gave her my number. I haven’t asked for hers nor given her my number a second time. I didn’t want to be the creep asking for her number or out on a date when she was working so that’s why I gave her my number and if she wanted to hear about work or where I grew up she could text me but if not no worries. I just like the friendliness that she provided and now I feel like I ruined it. Any advice would be appreciated. ",2,1754871616.0,dating_advice,54,0.55,False

1mmygmh,https://v.redd.it/o83y9vyb9aif1,Enough pole space for beginner? (After removing some furniture),"I primarily pole at my university gym since about 5 months, and I’ve been telling myself for a while that I don’t have room at all for a home pole.

But I think I actually would have decent space for beginner-level practice and conditioning if I made the following adjustments:

- totally downsize TV console to one that hugs the wall (I’m talking really narrow, probably just enough to hold the Nintendo switch)
-remove ikea floor lamp next to tv
-move AC unit to the side while practicing (when not in storage for most of the year)
-put furniture sliders on the couch feet to push it back/angle it out of the way
-move coffee table during practice time
-maybe remove bookcase (don’t think it’s super in the way but it would be nice to put some kind of floor mirror in the corner or put mirror squares on the wall behind where the bookcase is)

Husband is about the same height as me and I won’t be wearing heels, maybe minimal floor work if I don’t have room. 

What do you think? I know my husband isn’t holding the broom perfectly still (I was giving bad directions) but where the broom is is about where there’s a stud in the ceiling. It’s not ideal but I think it could work for the next few years until we move to a bigger space. All I really need to do is conditioning and some beginner spins and static tricks that don’t require me fully extending myself.

 Over the last three years I’ve found that meeting new people for coffee or drinks gives me terrible social anxiety. I at first  thought it was a lingering issue from social distancing in the pandemic, but as I’ve realized I am in peri, I now know it’s hormone related. 

In the before peri and before pandemic times, I would often meet a new person one on one for coffee or drinks to build a new friendship. I would get a little nervous at first but usually once the conversation started (and maybe a glass or two of wine!) I would always have an awesome time and be so glad I met up. Now the same kind of social engagement will leave me dripping with sweat and terror and like this really weird next level of self consciousness panic that amps up my brain fog and all I want to do is figure out how to get out of the social engagement as fast as possible. It’s wild. I am in therapy and my therapist has concluded that hormones have given me an uptick in anxiety and that any stress makes me feel overwhelmed quickly. She suggests I keep setting up these social engagements and then if I get really anxious or have a hot flash (I think part of why I get nervous is the fear of getting a hot flash or a migraine or nausea or lose my train of thought… which I often get now) to just say I’m in Peri and dealing with symptoms and that I need to leave. This feels embarrassing to have to tell someone. 

Can anyone relate to this? How did you get through it? what are you doing to keep your social life going? On one had I think my therapist is right and I should keep pushing myself so that I don’t become a weird hermit, but on another hand I feel like maybe I should stop trying to socialize until I’m in a more stable place. Just make my whole life focused on balancing my body and mind during this transition. ",2,1754871192.0,Perimenopause,2,1.0,False

Hi! Awfully new to this, but I’m actually stressing about my future and what better place than ask strangers on the internet.

I’ll try to make my story short but I was born and raised in what you would translate to a ""cult"" it was really hard for me especially because I had to raise my siblings (both older and younger) and take care of elderly family members. At 12 years old my dad tried to marry me off in a different country, tried again at 14 and 18. 

I’ve been in therapy for domestic violence victims, and lived in refuges, went to foster homes for weeks to months before being sent back. 

Went to more therapy, psychiatrist, psychologist, therapist, doctors, social workers, cps agents, police officers, school counselling.
And now I can’t find anything to help me cope,
I’ve been feeling stressed about kids that aren’t actually my own, some are in college and I’m so proud of them but they don’t even care about me anymore, I taught them how to read, cook, swim, drive, do laundry, what death, birth and contraception is. Just what our parents are supposed to do. 
I’m crying myself to sleep because I can’t find a job to pay for college I keep dropping out off, I was supposed to move in a new city but stayed to be able to answer to their emergency calls. 
I’m not sure anymore if I actually want to have kids or not, I didn’t want to become a parent at 8 but I really want to have a happy family some days. I just feel like I’m going crazy, every year that I get to see the younger kids I’m just slaving away at the stove, the school drop off, the haircuts. Everything is just making me want to become violent with myself. 
I don’t even feel worthy of being tired because most parents on here got pregnant, built watermelon sized humans for months before birthing them one way or another. (both extremely impressive and terrifying) and I’m just a small guy who doesn’t know shit about being a mum.



Anyways the whole point of my ranting was to get advices on how to cope, I don’t drink coffee or alcohol, or much sugary drinks for that matter so I’m not becoming like my grandparents, babysitting a bottle instead of kids. 

Ok then cheers everyone, stay healthy.

I wake to a screeching, electronic beep. Alarms are blaring all over the ship. I am up in seconds, clothed in a few more. I slam the button to open the door and run out into the hallway. Ciara goes running by me in her sleepwear with a familiar red canister.

 “There’s a fire in the engine room!” she yells over her shoulder. Apparently, the heatsinks couldn’t handle the prolonged cloak.

 I snag another fire extinguisher off the wall in one of the cargo rooms and run toward the back of the ship. Ciara and Ailis are already there, wearing protective suits. Ciara tosses me one and I slip into it as fast as I can. The fire isn’t too large, but it threatens to spread to the other heatsinks in the room. Even worse, it could reach the fusion engine and we would be nothing but a firework in the sky for anyone watching from the moon. I yank the pin from the extinguisher and let loose. Between the three of us, the fire is out in short order. Unfortunately, that heatsink and the one next to it are toast.

 “We need to get out of here yesterday,” says Ailis, dropping her tank and heading for the front of the ship.

Ciara and I join her, taking our seats at the consoles on either side of the room.

“Ah, hell,” Ailis curses. “The ship is in safety mode. It won’t go anywhere because it thinks it’s on fire!”

Ciara snaps her head to look at her mother. “Can’t you turn it off?” she asks.

“The heatsinks are confusing the system. It thinks the room is on fire because they’re…” she runs her finger across the screen, reading tiny glyphs. “…eight hundred degrees. Celsius. The systems shut down the cloaking device to save our asses and we’re stuck here until they cool off.”

I’m not sure what to do. Heatsinks do what they’re supposed to, they hold heat. It will take several hours for them to cool down any appreciable amount unless we vent it all into space and light ourselves up on sensors.

“Evan!” calls Ciara. I swivel my chair around and meet her gaze. She holds up her wrist and points at it with the other hand.

“…right!” I say, tapping the button on the Pedestal. T-01 appears in an instant, looking around the room at the general state of disarray. Performatively, of course. Thanks, dad.

“Hello, Evan Bright. I see the grouchy women in your company are multiplying. How may I help you?”

“Very funny for a glorified wristwatch,” huffs Ailis.

I cut off her sass. “The cloaking device overheated the heatsinks and two of them are ruined. The ship won’t let us go anywhere because it thinks it’s on fire. Can you help?”

“Is the captain alright with me digging into the systems?” it asks, rotating toward Ailis without so much as shuffling its feet. Oddly uncanny.

“Yes, sure, whatever. Just get us out of here!” she demands.

“I come with a standard Directorate port, in case my Pedestal needs to be plugged in. Connect me to the captain’s console so I can properly access the systems. I could try to do it remotely but it takes some time to fight through the firewalls.”

Ciara runs to her room and grabs the cord for her tablet, plugging it into the pilot’s console. I attach it to the Pedestal and the tiny me fizzles out of existence.

Suddenly, a voice comes over the intercom. “Evan Bright, can you hear me?”

After a moment’s confusion, I respond. “Yes, I can hear you. What do you need?”

“There is a malfunctioning radiator in the engine room. If you can fix it, I can seal the room and vent the heatsinks into it which will let the radiator dump the heat into the vacuum.”

I sprint to my room to grab my tools, Ciara hot on my heels. She slams into my back as I stop at my door which earns her a glare as I retrieve my bag. Together, we make for the engine room. The radiator is tucked into the corner opposite the burned out heatsinks behind some boxes. We move them out of the way, and I get to work.

“I think it’s jammed,” I tell Ciara. “The panel is stuck; it can’t extend out into space.”

“I… might know why,” Ciara says, embarrassed. She sticks her hand into the open radiator and bends it upward, reaching just out of sight. As she pulls her hand back, I get a good glimpse at the object she retrieved. It is a box about a foot wide, eight or nine inches tall, and only a couple inches thick. She opens it to reveal a rather expensive-looking pistol.

“I got it for da’s birthday the year that he died. I never got to give it to him. This was the one place on the ship I figured he wouldn’t look.”

“At least it’s out,” I say, trying not to shame her for what is obviously her fault. It only lit the ship on fire, after all.

We put the front panel back on the radiator and I speak in the general direction of the ceiling. “Tee-oh-one, the radiator should work now. Give it a try.”

The radiator clicks and whirrs a few times. It groans to life with a mechanical grinding sound, making me grimace.

“The panel is extended. Not very well, but enough,” says the ceiling. “It should have enough heat vented within a few minutes for you to get the ship moving. Not to add stress to the situation, but I have detected ships heading in this direction. We have about three hours until they get here. We should be long gone before then.”

I am so tired of running for my life. I have read stories about people doing it their whole lives; compared to the last, oh, twenty-four hours, that must feel like an eternity.

Ciara and I exchange a glance and head toward the cockpit once more. Ailis is seated in her command chair with a tiny hologram of myself standing before her. They’re discussing something technical about the ship’s software.

I try to figure out what they’re saying but they’re working on a level above my pay grade. I turn back toward my room and spot Ciara shamelessly cooling herself in front of the air conditioner in the hallway. She does a slow spin, getting refreshing air on all sides of her neck. As she comes around to face the cockpit, she opens her eyes and sees me standing there with the dumbest grin I’ve ever worn in my life.

“Evan!” she yells, leaning into her room and grabbing a baseball which brushes my hair on its trajectory toward the front of the ship. Now I’m laughing.

As I stand upright again after dodging her missile, the lanky redhead hits me from the top rope. Her impact knocks me backwards and we find ourselves sprawled out on the ground in the cockpit. She’s attempting to put me in some sort of armlock.

“Do I need to ground you both?” asks Ailis, now swiveled around in her chair to see the commotion happening behind her. T-01 is still projected off her console, hands behind its back and a very familiar grin spread across it’s face.

“Are we there yet?” I ask, pinned to the floor with my arm in the most uncomfortable position it’s ever experienced. I really need some combat training.

“Roll to your right, Evan,” instructs Ailis. I follow her advice and throw my weight sideways. Ciara may know how to fight, but I am still bigger and stronger than she is. She stumbles, throwing her leg out to catch her own weight as well as to combat mine, but it’s too much. She slips and I complete my roll, now in a seated position facing the opposite direction while she recovers her footing. I don’t let her.

I’m on her in a second, putting her in an awkward bear hug as I pin her arms to her sides. Our noses are practically touching. Her eyes are a gorgeous, crystalline green. And her smile… why is she smiling?

I learn the hard way not to get distracted. Her knee impacts my crotch with the force of a meteor. All I can manage is a squeak as I collapse on the floor. She stands, dusting her hands off and walking toward her room. I swear she’s putting some swagger into her hips as she walks just to prove a point. Meanwhile, Ailis is doubled over the command console dying of laughter.

After a minute or two of groaning as I roll around on the floor recovering, I manage to get myself situated. I don’t think I’m ever going to live this down.

“Great job, Romeo,” chokes out Ailis, recovering her breath. She tosses me the ball that rolled up alongside her after Ciara’s outburst.

I mumble something unintelligible and head toward my room. Finders keepers, I grumble to myself.

I spend the next few hours in my room talking with T-01 through his ceiling voice.

“According to the Directorate net,” it says, “this… revolution, as they are calling it, has spread across the whole Saturn system. Nowhere is safe at the moment. I am currently advising our captain that the best course of action would be to seek shelter with one of the independent colonies around Jupiter. It would take us some two weeks to get there.”

“Two weeks,” I say to myself in an attempt to accept it. I’ve never even left Titan, and as far as I know they’ve never left the system. Going between moons was a matter of hours, this is a matter of weeks. It’s a big difference when you’re stuck in a flying coffin containing the corpse of one of your parents.

“Indeed,” it continues. “It would seem there are some small colonies tucked away around Io and Callisto that might suit our purpose. The people in the Jupiter system are not quite as welcoming as those in the Directorate.”

T-01 is right. While the Saturn system was largely a series of European colonies and functions very similarly to the British parliament, Jupiter was American. From what I have read and seen in documentaries, most of the planets are still a relatively wild frontier. European colonies tended to band together and form large cities; by contrast, American colonies were loose collections of small, fiercely independent communities seeking to live their lives by their own rules. Of course, there are larger cities among them, but you’ll only find a handful compared to dozens on Titan or Dione. Though their mother countries have been ash for centuries, they stand as a testament to the values their founders held.

At least we speak the same language. Sort of.

I spend those two weeks learning all I can about the Jupiter system. My research leads me to all parts of the scientific world, from biology, to chemistry, even getting into sociology. Poor Ciara has listened to me rant and rave about the intricacies of converting a moon with a nitrogen sea into one covered in water, or how the ethnically diverse American people have formed one of the more homogenous societies in the solar colonies despite the strife of their past.

One night, about a week into our journey, there is a light knock at my door. I stand and press the button on the wall, sliding the door into its alcove and revealing my friend. She is wearing her usual tank top and shorts that she wears to bed with the addition of tears staining her face. I have never seen her cry before.

“Hey… what’s wrong?” I ask, unprepared for being confronted with her emotional state.

She sniffles, walking into me as she steps into the room. I naturally take a step back as she does so and she closes the door behind her. She pushes her back against the now-sealed door and slides down onto her butt.

“I’m sorry,” she whispers. “I had a nightmare. There were the drones, and all the blood… your ma…” Her voice trails off as she burns a hole through the floor trying to avoid my gaze with the last part of her sentence. I don’t respond. Instead, I sit on the floor next to my bed, knees up in the same posture with my feet on either side of hers.

We sit for what feels like a long time. I’m not sure what to say. I’ve had dreams like that just about every night. My traitorous arm decides to take action for me, since the rest of me is apparently useless. I hold out my hand toward her. She looks at it for a moment before placing hers in it. I give her the same gesture she does me when I’m stressed; I just rub my thumb on her hand. It’s soft, softer than I’d imagined for a girl who spends so much time working with her hands.

“Ma taught me how to use the guns on the ship when I was little. The other day? That was the first time I’ve ever shot another ship out of the air,” she says, after a while.

“We’ve been through a lot in a short while, that’s for sure.”

Idiot. NPC response #46 is not what I was looking for.

“Uh,” I continue. “What I mean is, you’re holding it together really well if this is your first time with this stuff. You’ve seen me break down more than once recently.”

She just shrugs and puts her other hand on top of mine.

“At least we have each other to lean on. Ma… she hasn’t leaned on anyone since da died. Not even me. Sure, she loves me and takes care of me. Looks out for my best interests, saw that I got an education even aboard this ship and all. But she hasn’t really had any friends since then, other than your parents.”

I sigh as she finishes her sentence, trying to deflect the wave of emotion she just delivered my mourning mind.

“Oh, Evan. I’m sorry. You don’t need this right now.”

“No, no,” I say. “I was having a hard time sleeping too. Want to… stay? Just for a bit?”

She nods. I stand up and crawl back into my little bunk, snug up against the wall and laying on my side. She joins me, resting her head on my arm and facing the door. She fiddles with my hand and starts humming a song. I’ve never heard whatever it is she’s humming and I had absolutely no idea she has such a pretty singing voice. Despite the hair in my face and the pins and needles in my arm, it has been a long time since I’ve been this relaxed.

The next morning, I wake up with her drool running down my arm. There’s also a sound outside in the hallway. Is that… knocking? But not on my door. Oh, crap.

I shake Ciara, who lifts her head up. Her hair is a nightmarish tangle of locks, dried saliva is stuck to the side of her mouth, and her eyes are glossed over. “Your mom is knocking on your door,” I whisper.

Now she’s awake.

“Go out there and distract her. Take her to the cockpit or something!” she hisses, rolling off the bed and standing beside the door where she wouldn’t be seen.

I hop up, throwing a shirt on and opening the door. As expected, Ailis is on the other side facing Ciara’s door.

“Morning,” I yawn, trying to act nonchalant.

“Hey kiddo,” Ailis replies. “Ciara is one hell of a heavy sleeper. I needed to ask her…”

I cut her off mid-sentence. “Can we get some coffee before having this conversation? I’m not awake enough to get my butt kicked by an angry redhead and I’m sure she’d prefer to wake up to a warm drink too.”

“…sure. I know you like it the way I make it.”

She heads toward the kitchen with me following just behind. I glance back behind us just in time to see Ciara disappear into her own room. Mission accomplished. One of these days I’ll figure out why we’re pretending like we’re not twenty-one years old.

I sit at the table while Ailis goes about making the coffee. She really does make a good cup of the brown stuff, even if it all comes out of vacuum-sealed packages.

“It’s nice to have some company around the ship,” she says while dancing between cabinets gathering ingredients and cups. “It’s been me and Ciara onboard for, oh, eight years. I don’t know if you noticed, but there’s two more cabins besides the three of ours. It’s not really meant to be a two-person ship.”

I nod thoughtfully. “Yeah, I picked up on that. There’s an old console in the engine room and one in the storage bay off to the side. You know, the one that looks like it should be a medical room.”

Ailis shrugs and continues preparing the coffee. “What can I say? We can’t afford a nurse, or the equipment. So storage it is. Go get Ciara, would you?”

I hop up and walk down the hall back toward her room. Just as I go to knock on the door, it slides open and my first knock passes through air, almost smacking Ciara in the face. Her hair is back under control and she’s properly clothed now.

“How’s ma?” she asks, clearly not worried about her mother’s health.

“She’s cool. Coffee’s almost ready.”

“Awesome,” she says, pushing past me and marching down the hall with me in tow.

When we arrive, there are three steaming hot cups of coffee sitting at the table with a packaged meal by each. At least they’re varied by intended meal; it’s nice to have eggs and ham for breakfast instead of meatloaf or something.

Once we’re all seated, we dig in. Each of us is lost in our own thoughts. Ciara and I are seated opposite each other on the round table. Every time I look up at her from my meal, she’s looking back at me.

“I’m not giving up the double bunk in the captain’s quarters for you two,” says Ailis, completely unprompted. “Me and Daniel made do with a single bunk when we first met.”

My face goes red. Ciara is looking anywhere but at either of us. Ailis just sits there, sipping her drink and reveling in the glory of the awkwardness.

“I hate to interrupt,” the ceiling says. “I’ll be slowing the ship and making some maneuvers. We need to account for Jupiter’s gravity and the placement of the moons. We will be landing on Europa in a few days.”

Ailith downs the rest of her still-too-hot coffee in a single chug, planting the cup back on the table. “That’s my cue. Clean up for me, would you?”

As she leaves, Ciara and I take a moment before either of us speak.

“I like long walks on the beach, bagged coffee, and have very few dating options at the moment,” she says after a few seconds. A hint of a smile is pulling at the edge of her mouth, combatted by the coffee cup she has held to her lips.

“Good thing we’re going to an ocean world,” I comment, grabbing the captain’s breakfast mess and heading to the sink to get it cleaned up. “I’ve heard American girls manage to sleep next to someone without drooling on them.”

“I’m sorry!” she whines. “I didn’t even mean to fall asleep.”

I smile to myself as I’m washing the mugs.

“How did she know?” I say after a moment.

“One of two things. She checked the security cameras from last night, or mini-Evan is a snitch.”

“I am many things,” says the speaker above our heads, “but I am not a snitch. I have access to a vast swathe of records and medical studies on humans. I believe it is a widely-known but poorly-understood concept called ‘intuition’ that we are working with.”

“Moms can read minds, he means,” sighs Ciara.

“Humans possess no psionic abilities-”

“It’s a figure of speech, you wind blowing toaster.”

“If I could cook bread, I would burn yours,” T-01 retorts.

She gives a short huff, half-hearted chuckle built into the gesture as she finishes her coffee.

“You know, one of these days he might actually get good at comebacks. Then I won’t even need you anymore,” I say over my shoulder.

She stands, making her way over to me. She stops as she reaches me and looks me in the eye. She opens her mouth to say something before snapping it shut again. Instead, she drops the cup into the sink, spilling the drops at the bottom onto the newly cleaned mugs.

“Thanks Evan! You’re the best,” she says, beaming me a big toothy smile before trotting off toward her room.

“Do you want me to lock her bedroom door before or after she gets inside?” asks the ceiling.

I laugh to myself. “Don’t do it, she’ll eat through the metal and then kill us both.”

The next couple of days pass by without any issues. Jupiter is within sight after a couple of days, and we make our way around the titanic planet as we slow from travel speed down to something more manageable. Europa appears at the edge of the gas giant and is finally fully visible in the middle of the penultimate day of our trip, slowly growing larger. The day of our arrival, we are all in our seats in the command center.

“Captain,” T-01 says, appearing as a hologram before her on her console. “We are being hailed by Europan security forces.”

“Put them on the viewscreen,” she orders.

Europa and the stars disappear. In its place, an aging man with dark skin, curly hair and a single bionic eye appears.

“This is colonel Kingston of the United Europan Colonies,” he says authoritatively in an unfamiliar accent. “We have been informed you intend to dock in New Athens. Follow your current flight path. Once you reach atmosphere, you will be escorted by fighters. We don’t get visitors from the Directorate often and you will forgive the caution.”

His last sentence is not a recommendation.

Ailis puts on her best fake smile. “We will. Thank you, Colonel.”

The viewscreen returns to its normal image of space zoomed in on Europa with a red circle positioned over our intended landing site. It is a small archipelago in the southern hemisphere of the moon surrounded by hundreds of miles of ocean.

“What was up with that eye?” asks Ciara. “I’ve never seen a mechanical eye. Can’t they just regrow it if something was wrong with it?”

“Other places don’t have the same laws about cybernetics and enhancements that the Directorate does, hun. We should be careful. Don’t stare or ask too many questions.”

And so it begins, the consequences for my friends who turned out to be shit during treatment or this year. One recently asked me to do something which I consider deeply unethical, I said no, and he asked me not to ask him for help anymore and stopped talking to me. 

One was a shit friend all through treatment, living 20 min away, being around for cute things like coffees and lunches and after surgery an entire week later she came over with a soup after a friend who lives across the country flew in day of surgery bcuz she knew I had no one and another across country friend visited. Shit friend prob thinks she was a good friend bcuz she was around for all the cute things like coffee or lunches but no hospital rides, couldn’t be bothered to even attend a zoom meeting w my friends right after dx. She had an unplanned pregnancy this year and had to move, I lend her something a wheeling cart to help that I need for my job, she naturally loses the lid so all my work material gets soaked whenever it rains now. No thank you to me for the baby shower gifts tho she knows I went bankrupt from treatment. 

Makes fun of me last month calling my cross country friend visiting for my bday my “friends w benefits” tho he’s not that, and she being 20 min away couldn’t show up on my birthday as usual, note she has lived here her entire life with her entire support network here who could watch the kid for an hour to meet me for a bday ice cream but she doesn’t care and has the audacity to make fun of the one person who does show up for me. I also felt her brat friends from HS make fun of me at one point during her baby shower as I questioned the name of a seltzer, literally laughing at me like I didn’t get it. She likes to invalidate me too, thinking it’s no biggie my family didn’t visit at all during treatment. No biggie preg is way more complicated for me now bcuz Tam life and my age. No biggie I’m deeply unhappy in the city we live in and she hasn’t encouraged me to move, only reminding me things could be worse elsewhere. Turns out, she only liked me for the social capital I brought into her life ie I am intellectual and we had many intellectual conversations and I’m attractive; it’s clear now that’s all I was… social capital boost. Being “good looking” is the only thing cancer didn’t take from me. Most days too now I want to unzip myself from my body and just have my soul walking around, like I have to relearn how to live inside of this shell that caused so many problems.
 I’m really done with her, it’s just a matter of ghosting or nah.

The grove - I honestly couldn’t finish this. BUT maybe you will like it. 

The land of blue lakes - In Russian 

Blank Page- meh

Underground - bachelorette gone wrong. This was “fine” imo

Lexi-I like that this was kind of documentary style. I wish there had been more creepy things that had happened.  Like I get the stuff that was happening to her was weird. But it would’ve been cool to have seen maybe a person creeping around in the background or something. 

Lola (I can’t remember where I watched this)

VHS 94 (Tubi)

Chest (Tubi) - 

Scary Stories: Dark Web (YouTube)

Raised by Wolves - on Tubi. I didn’t care for this one but other people loved it. 

The house on Mansfield street - entertaining. 

Spirit Chaser (aka: Sanitarium)

The Deep House - I did not finish this one. It was mentioned on this subreddit a few times but it goes in and out of being found footage. 

Ghoul 

Outwaters (on Tubi) 

missing couple (on tubi) - 

Moth (on tubi) - actually surprisingly decent. Stick with it. 

Alien Origin (Peacock) 

Mister Creep (Tubi)

Ghosts of Chernobyl (amazing)

Project Angst (Tubi) uhhh well that was a movie.  

Xii (tubi) 

————————-————————-————————-

April-2022

Behind the Sightings- (on Prime) it’s clowns. Which for me was “meh”. But it’s a found footage film I hadn’t seen!

The tunnel (@simon76p)- this was a difficult one to track down! So many people recommended it…. And I kept searching for it. Finally I watch it and I am 99.9% positive I have seen this before 😅 it was before I started cataloging them (because I was tired of forgetting the movies names) 

Dead Voices - (Tubi) 

Howard’s Mill - (on Tubi)

Paranoia Tapes 2- (on Tubi) apparently there’s like a whole series of these. I watched the second because I couldn’t find the first. Wasn’t my cup of tea. I think that’s because I went into it thinking it would be more anthology style like VHS. 

The Rohl Farms Haunting-(on Tubi) didn’t enjoy it. Maybe you will. 

Chronicle-such a great found footage that I keep forgetting to list. 

2 Jennifer-sequel of “to Jennifer”. I enjoyed it. Not as much as the first. But worth watching if you saw the first. 

The faith community - little bit drawn out. But I enjoyed it

————————-————————-————————-

August 2021

Lovely Molly (on Tubi)- I’m going to be annoying for this. But this isn’t a “true found footage film”. Once you’re past the opening intro the movie is shot like any typical film, with bits of “I’ve gotta get this on tape” peppered throughout.

A note on this: Personally, I want the realism. I want that fake af “police have found this tape”. “The media has released this footage.” “What you are about to see is found footage from XYZ event” realize this is strictly a personal preference. So I’m including it on the list of FF because it does have FF elements and has some scare factor (which I assume we all kind of like right?). 

Curse of Aurore- (Amazon Prime) - low budget. But I enjoy all the “what was that behind them” moments 

The Expedition Tapes- (on Tubi) pretty low video quality footage. Meh. I didn’t love this one. 

Lilin’s Brood- (on Amazon Prime)- ehhh…

Without Warning - (@foundfootagefan posted about this one)- older film from 94. This is the first found footage I have ever watched where my partner said “wow this is good” 

Diary of the dead (recommended by @jimes00) -I feel like zombies aren’t a common found footage film

Case 347- (on Tubi again lol) - Aliens. 

Followed - (also on Tubi) I really enjoyed this one. I wouldn’t mind them doing a sequel 

The documentary - (found on Tubi) holy naked people Batman! I’m not a prude by any means, it just took me by surprise. 

Apartment 143- I don’t know why. But I didn’t love this one. Maybe I just wasn’t in the right mind set for this type of film right now or what. 

To Jennifer- this movie is good imo. It’s not amazingly good. But I still think of this movie sometimes. 

BigFoot: The lost coast tapes- on Tubi. If I remember right, fallenangel152 recommended this. And can I just say, I owe you a coffee because I can’t believe I hadn’t seen that before. 

Red Wood (Amazon Prime) - watchable. 

Documenting the Witch Path (Amazon Prime and Tubi) 

Exists (Tubi)- this one was fun. I’m not a “BigFoot” lore type but it was a fun ride. 

————————-————————-————————-

June 2021

Brew House (on Tubi)

4K killer-not a fan personally. But I’ve seen it on other people’s lists so maybe you’ll enjoy it. 

lost footage of Leah Sullivan (@subgenre_fanatic) - I enjoyed this one! 

Cruiser

Turtle island

The haunting of Grady farm

Invoked 

2survive

Hangman (on Tubi) 

Amber Alert

December 2020
Incident- Spanish film. I enjoyed this one. 

Daylight- I liked this one. There were some parts that were a bit confusing but overall I enjoyed it. Found on Amazon Prime. 

-Apocalypse Cult - I’m allllll about weird religion shit for FF films. does anyone else accidentally watch a movie they have already seen, but doesn’t realize it till about 20 minutes in. That was me with this film. Suddenly I was like “oh wait... I’ve seen this”. 

-Murder death Korea town (@fuckfucknoose)- I love the psychological shi

-8ight after 

-The lost blog of ruby real-

Update September 2020

The Atticus institute- I finally bit the bullet and rented this. Enjoyed it. 

Houses October built- I’m a little surprised I have never seen this. It was enjoyable. Well shot. Good spook factor. 

Evil Things- I like this kind of “real life” horror scenario. Not a ghostie FF (although I do enjoy those). The last ten min was pretty unnerving. 

Followers (2017)- I liked the idea of this. But this is pretty bad. Also, bro how do you get lost on a looped 3 mile paved park trail. 

Operation avalanche- interesting.  Not a horror film. But interesting. 

-Victor’s History- okay this isn’t a horror film in the typical sense. But I really love that realistic social tension so I liked this one a lot. If you like the hyper realistic and the more “psychological” thriller. This is good. 

-The Hunted- this wasn’t my favorite. Had a lot of potential with the creepy woods vibe. But the story was a little lacking. But you might like it. 

-Gaga the clown- skip it. 

-Unaware. I love that it was so easy to bust open sealed barns and boxes with a crow bar. Not a ton of build up. Emphasis on the low budget aspect, but mildly enjoyable. 

-American Descent-the beginning almost lost me, but I stuck it out. I enjoyed the teenagers being teenagers aspect of it. Made it seem more real. 

-Nightlight-pretty decent. This one just jumps right into the action whereas most FF take awhile. Moral of the story: play stupid games win stupid prizes. 

-Resolution (recommended by
@subgenre_fanatic) - this movie was....”interesting”. It was not a found footage film at all. This was a but of an undecided theme. One minute it’s religious spooky, then maybe there’s indigenous culture vibes, but then we go to weird creepy dude vibes? I’m not sure what was going on here. But the ending was a pleasant surprise. 

Unfriended- it’s worth a mention. The tiny Skype screens seemed annoying. And were these all only children whose parents weren’t home?? If I heard a sibling of mine hollering like that I’d call 911

Update July 2020
Asylum: the lost footage. 
The devils doorway 

Update June 2020
-Borderlands/Final Prayer (had to rent it from my library. Loved. I think of that ending from time to time. So great) 

-Digging up the marrow. ( I enjoyed this one) 

-Banshee chapter (this is not a found footage film. It has Found Footage elements but I wouldn’t consider it a FF film) 

-Apollo 18 (forgot to add this to my original list)

-Behind the Mask (I intentionally didn’t add this originally because I felt it was more satirical. But it’s worth a mention)

-Survive the hollow shoals (worth checking out. Thanks to @awesabre for reminding me of this one. )

-Hollows Grave (kinda cheesy. But okay)

-Home movie (I was finally able to track this down thanks to @Rechan. I loved the ending)

-Absence (hell yes. This type of realism is why I like FF)

-Found Footage 3D (this I loved. I love a movie where you have to “catch things”   Last twenty ish minutes was 👌🏼

-Hell House LLC 3 ( I was nervous to watch this one because the first is Good and the second was okay. I legit was creeped out with that scene with the kiss. Definitely check this one out. Interesting ending...)

-The Dirties (found this on Shudder. Personally not a fan. It’s more mockumentry. This is scary in its realism. If you just want to get straight to the scary: Last 15 minutes of the film. 

- Cold Ground (film starts in French but switches to English early on. I didn’t love this one)

-Be my cat: a letter for Anne  (psychological film.)

-exhibit A (I like FF for the realism it provides. I enjoyed this one(

-Noroi (took forever to track this one down. Had to watch some super grainy version on YouTube. Loved this!!!) 

The dark tapes- I have actually seen this one already but had forgotten the name of it.  I really enjoyed the ending.   

Alien Valley - this was okay. 

————————-————————-————————-

Update June 2020
Troll Hunter ( this isn’t quite horror but is so worth a watch)
As Above So Below (I liked it!)
Afflicted (Good!)
Mothers of Monsters (is she crazy? Is he? I like that this keeps you guessing) 
Quarantine (I just forgot to add this originally)
Banshee chapter (It looses that found footage feel a couple times)
The coffin tapes (not a fan)
Char Man  (enjoyed it. Wish there was just a little more ‘action’. Liked the ending)
Shadow of the Missing (I personally felt that the constant back and forth between footage and interviews was distracting after awhile and took away from the creepiness)


————————-————————-————————-


May 2020
-The Mirror (fun but not stellar) 
-VHS (I love these ones. They are perfect because they are so short) 
-Paranormal Activity Series (of course I like this)

I’d prefer something not food-related if possible, and I’d like to avoid places where I’d end up spending a big chunk of my paycheck there (like coffee shops or places with tempting employee discounts).

1mmxst0,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAU/comments/1mmxst0/weight_loss_journey_for_wedding/,Weight loss journey for wedding,"34(M) AUS: Back in April 21st, 2025, I wanted to start exercising because I'm getting married in OCT 2025 and wanted to lose weight for my wedding (and overall feel much better about myself).

I found a bicycle for 20 AUD in Facebook marketplace and thought why not? I had to spend a few more bucks to service it myself and get it working properly. Since then, I've been cycling every day.

I was about 96kg+ when I first started, and I was doing 5-10km of cycling a day. The first thing I did when I started cycling was **cut my meal portions in half**. Once I started getting used to the routine, I started portioning and making sure I was in a calorie deficit. 3 months and a few weeks later, I'm now sitting at 72.95kg.

I didn't buy myself a scale until June 15th because I was too afraid that I might not be losing any weight. Then I realised all my jeans were getting loose and I immediately wanted to get a scale and track my weight. My first weight recorded was 84.3kg on June 15th.

**My current exercise routine:**

* Every weekday: Cycle 13-15km
* Every weekend: Cycle 33 - 36km
* Every day:
   * 300 pushups in reps of 30
   * At least 250 crunches in reps of 50
   * At least 5 Side planks with 35 seconds minimum on each side
   * At least 150 double leg raises in reps of 30

**Protein & Snacks:**

* Coffee
* Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein
* Vital Strength Hydroxy Ripped
* Dry roasted nuts (unsalted)
* Mandarin, Apple, Peach, Banana
* Greek Yoghurt
* Peanut butter (Crunchy & extra protein)

**My daily routine is mostly:**

* Coffee in the morning (no milk - never liked it in my coffee)
* Try to cycle before 1:30pm
* Do my pushups
* Protein shake of ON Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein once done
* Do all the ab exercises
* Some fruits (Apple/Banana/Pear) and some nuts to snack on.
* Dinner between 6pm - 7:30pm
   * Mostly a mix of:
      * Extra lean beef mince or chicken or lamb
      * Diced pumpkin and/or diced sweet potato
      * 2 eggs
      * Spinach, kale, parsley
      * Broccolini or broccoli
      * Edamame beans, Chickpeas
      * Diced beetroot
      * Sliced jalapenos and/or sliced pickles
      * Crumbled feta cheese
* \[8:30 - 9:30pm\] A bowl of Greek yoghurt with some peanut butter and berries
   * Or, Greek yoghurt and 1 scoop of Vital Strength Hydroxy Ripped Protein Powder mixed together
* A few more ab exercises
* Try and avoid food after 11:30pm
* Repeat

Cycling this rustic bicycle has been so much fun! The path is usually flat with 3 steep uphill bridges, but the gust is hectic, so it adds a bit more effort. The weekend path is more demanding and is constant uphill vs downhill. But I always try to beat my personal best from the previous day. So when things get easy, I start using only the higher gears to make it more demanding, and if that gets easy, I just floor it every now and then like a HIIT session.

I've also just recently started on my protein powder and I've been experimenting with making protein powder & rolled oats slices and other things, which are fun! Not to mention, my OCD luuuves having a schedule to stick to!

The biggest thing for me is that I feel great (even if I lose a bit of weight too frequently compared to what others might call ""healthy""). I used to have such bad heartburn after dinner back in the day and that has all gone away since I watch my calories/meals. Then there was the constant issue of being out of breath!

Me & my fiancée still enjoy some nights out together every now and then (there is an all-you-can-eat Japanese spot).

This will show you the heatmap of where I biked and where I stayed.

This is travel with a bike bag/case and no car, aka expert mode ( lol ). Mainly to answer general questions for anyone interested in this kind of trip. 

**1- Take the regional trains and book with Omio ( or whatever thing in advance )**. There was always lots of room on those trains, they run all the time and they go to a lot of places. Buses are more confusing and it'll be up to the driver to let you in with a big bike bag or not. You want to buy tickets in advance because the train stations are randomly unstaffed and the 1-2 ticket machines might have a line of confused tourists trying to use them. 

**2- Don't ride where it's flat/ not close to water.** These places tend to be crowded cities or agricultural/industrial land with fast narrow roads with no shoulder. Not much to see and it gets REAL DAMN HOT in the summer. 

**3- Avoid the bike paths.** That's sort of a given if you're a serious cyclist but the bike path network in Italy makes no sense whatsoever. You will have to use it sometimes to get around tunnels/highways but in general try to avoid these like the plague. 

**4- There's towns everywhere**. You barely need to plan food/water/stops because there's a coffee shop or bakery basically every 10 minutes.

**5- You probably need disc brakes**. Italy's mountains and climbs can be very steep and full of switchbacks meaning you have to brake constantly. You will not have a good time with rim brakes. Do not take any risks descending, there's lots of cars and they will just be zooming up the other direction on all these narrow roads and blind corners. 

**6- Prioritize Alps/ Dolomites**. *Downsides*: 150-200% price for accommodations, 4-5 hour public transit to reach from nearest midsized town, nothing much to do but bike, less easy access to grocery. *Upsides:* World class epicness of scenery everywhere you go.

**7- Bring a back light always**. There's tons and tons of tunnels almost everywhere around lakes and in the mountains, you never know when you will stumble on one and some of them are dangerously dark and narrow

**8- Check the weather every day especially the radar map**. I lost a lot of riding days because I didn't check the forecast in enough detail to find that ""severe storm warning"" actually meant ""it'll start raining near this mountain to the north maybe at 7pm today"". Worst case you can take a train/bus and ride 30 minutes away in a dry area. 

**9- Don't need to carry cash**. Didn't have to use cash ever. Just phone with credit card worked for everything. 

**10- There's lots of water fountains and they're on Googlemaps.** Abundant free fountains with clean water. They're almost impossible to spot from the road while biking but googlemaps has them so you can just stop and check where the next one is. 

===============================================

Standout Rides of the trip:

**Monte Grappa.** Famous climb used in the Giro. Tons of ways to get up the mountain from Bassano Del Grappa and lots of different places to ride from that city. 

**Sella Ronda.** The iconic loop of the Dolomites. Would be a 10/10 if not for the absurd amount of traffic. Prepare to rage as you get stuck behind a tour bus coming down every hill. 

**Tres Cime**. The most famous peaks of the Dolomites and a pretty challenging area to climb. Goes through Cortina D'Ampezzo which is a stupidly beautiful city. 

**Lake Como + Bike Museum**. Heavy traffic through the towns is very annoying but the lake is beautiful and what makes this a standout ride is the climb up Ghisallo Pass to the cycling church/museum. If you're a cyclist, you have to go!

**Lake Iseo.** Really beautiful lake with lots of climb options around it and you can take a ferry to the mountain in the middle ( weekdays only ).

**Monte Bondone**. Another Giro climb near Trento. Beautiful area in general at the foot of the Dolomites.

The fish salads are pickley/pungent. Perhaps better to make it with poached fish or tuna if you really can't stand other canned fishes. Perhaps make it with another meat if you really can't stand fish in general.

I had my daughter at 14 and I’m now 18 about to start University. When I got pregnant at such a young age, I thought I was straight, but after growing more in these last few years I’ve actually realized I’m lesbian. 

Of course with a child, school, coparenting, and working, dating was the last thing on my mind for a long time. However, I recently met a nice girl (20F) who happens to be my coworker at the coffee shop I work at during the summer. She’s pretty, funny, has great hair, and just overall awesome. After getting her insta and talking more, I finally was able to get the courage to ask her out! She said yes and we went on 2 dates before making it official. I was really excited to finally have romance in my life. 

However, about 3 days ago I was hanging out at her apartment when i finally mentioned my daughter. I didn’t make it a big deal, I just slipped it into casual conversation. I don’t know if that was the right move because she immediately started freaking out. She told me that I was a liar and that she didn’t want to date a “bisexual baby mama.” That obviously stung because I’m not bisexual and I already have my daughter so I can’t just get rid of her. I tried to explain that it didn’t have to affect our relationship because I’m not comfortable introducing them until we were more serious but that seemed to get her more upset. She told me that I was hiding my kid and then asked me to go home.

 I talked to my friends and they told me I should’ve been honest from the jump, especially since we’re at an age where it’s not necessarily normal to have a kid. I feel like it’s fair for me to not reveal every little detail about me until I feel more secure, but not many people seem to agree. It’s been super awkward at work, and she told one of our coworkers and the coworker has been making little comments about me. I’m not even sure we’re together anymore.

1mmxkxg,https://i.redd.it/dvjitru12aif1.jpeg,"After months of solo work, my dating app finally got approved for pre-registration on Google Play. Looking for feedback","Hey everyone,

After months of solo development, countless cups of coffee, and learning as I go, I finally have something I'm excited to share with you all.

The idea for YourWave was born out of my own frustration. I was tired of the feeling that dating apps have become a popularity contest where ghosting is the norm and conversations die before they even start. I decided that instead of giving up, I'd try to build the space I'd want to use myself.

The result is an app built on a different philosophy:
* Connections based on who you are: The algorithm focuses on your shared tastes and interests. It's about finding your people, not just a gallery of bodies.

* A 'Nomad Mode' to break down barriers: It lets you chat and connect with people from any city in the world, right from your home.

* Made for everyone, and for you: The app is translated into over 30 languages and is highly customizable—way beyond just a light/dark mode—so you can make it feel truly yours.

* Chats without barriers: If you match with someone, the conversation is yours. No artificial limits or paywalls for basic features.

* Real privacy and control: I've put a special emphasis on you always having full control over your visibility and information.

The big step is that Google has finally approved the app, and it's now up for pre-registration on the Play Store for Android. (I'm currently working hard on the iOS version, you're next in line!).

To celebrate and as a heartfelt thank you to the first people who believe in this project, I've enabled a reward: 1 month of Premium for free for everyone who pre-registers (no cards, no tricks, just a straight-up gift on launch day, August 22nd).

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neowavecode.yourwave&pcampaignid=web_share

I would be incredibly grateful for your honest feedback. Do you think an approach like this makes sense? What's your biggest turn-off with current apps? Any feedback on the concept or the offer would be incredibly valuable.

1mmxk1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1mmxk1w/is_there_a_word_for_feeling_a_little_manic/,Is there a word for feeling “a little manic?”,"EDIT: Just to clarify for those saying hypomania, I think the symptoms match up but I thought it has to be a continuous thing for several days? Is it still hypomania if I only go into that state for a few hours at a time, a few times a week?

——————

Hey all, I’m newly diagnosed bipolar after a manic episode cost me my job about 6 months ago. I’m fully ramped up on a mood stabilizer that’s helping a lot, but I’m still dealing with moments that I think of as being “a little manic” or being “activated”. It happened a lot while I was coming out of that manic episode, and now it still happens sometimes but to a much lesser degree. 

When this happens I shift into a mental state where I’m more productive and energetic, but I’m also a little more distractible, irritable, and impulsive. It’s fairly subtle, feeling kinda like I’ve just had two strong cups of coffee and one hit off a THC vape. This typically lasts between 2 and 4 hours, then afterwards I crash and have absolutely no energy for 30 minutes to an hour afterward. It’s usually triggered by caffeine or THC use, but not always. 

I’m curious if anybody’s had similar experiences, or if anyone knows what the proper term to describe this state would be. Is this like, mild hypomania or a mixed episode or something? This happens several times a week at least, and it’s exhausting to ride in this rapid-cycling roller coaster. ",4,1754868778.0,bipolar,4,0.84,False
1mmxjbc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiStories/comments/1mmxjbc/seed36_the_fractured_veil_chapter_5/,Seed36: The Fractured Veil - Chapter 5,"**Chapter 5: Jean**

The deck of the Wasp hummed with the rhythm of a barely contained force, thrumming through the polished alloy rails and up into Jean’s spinal implants. The ferry coasted high above the surface of the water, skimming the invisible lines carved into the sky, silent but for the low hum of turbine gyros spooling through compression units. His coat billowed in the downwash, a charcoal drape of cashmere that clung to the precise lines of his frame. It was early still. Mist clung to the windows like a half forgotten-memory, leaving the world soft around the edges as it came into focus. 

	Jean leaned on the balcony rail, his gloves folded and tucked into his belt behind his back, his boots resting on the narrow lip that separated the viewing platform from the velocity glass. Below, the black sea broke against invisible reefs, laced with oily phosphorescence. Above, the sky rippled with lensflare ghosts. Fragments of broadcast signals and encrypted drone traffic overhead.

	His suitcase sat beside him. Ordinary to anyone else. Unmarked, mattefinished carbon shell. Inside, the delicate entrails of a private world. Stasis locked tinctures, carved sigil stones, rows of needles fine enough to suture atoms. He had packed it himself, methodically in the way others packed sentimental items. His tools were sentimental. His past and future in miniature glass coffins. 

	His reflection wavered in the darkened ferry glass, broken by the blue white strobe of a nearby relay tower. Jean stood composed. The stiff wool of his charcoal coat draped perfectly across his broad shoulders. His skin, deep and unblemished, caught the low light with the gleam of polished basalt. A fresh top of the line V-chip port nested cleanly at the base of his skull, the polymer still faintly rigid from the exchange. Beneath one pierced ear, the small glint of an archival diamond flickered, Studio 7’s mark of tenure. 

	His hair was cropped tight, military short, exposing the powerful symmetry of his face. Nothing about him moved without purpose. Neat, deliberate, built like a man engineered to solve problems with words when possible, or by force on a deadline. When he turned, even the sound of his boots suggested authority: quiet, firm, expensive.

	He lit a cigarette, a real one, not a synthstick, and let the ember fight against the wind. The smoke curled up, then blew sideways off the ferry’s edge.

	He didn’t know what was waiting for him at Studio7's Research Annex in the Chilean Strip, not entirely. But he knew enough to expect failure disguised as ambition. People dressing up their desperation in confidence and drowning their caution in credits. That was what the film industry was now. Powerful, hungry, and stitched into the machinery of myth and state alike.

	They were calling this place a “development site,” but the word meant something different when it came from Studio7 executives. It wasn’t storyboards and casting calls. It was classified screenings, off-ledger testing, and memory crafting by people who’d never been inside their own minds unaided.

	Jean exhaled and rolled his shoulders. His reflection in the velocity glass didn’t blink. It stood motionless beside the ghosted edges of the ferry’s logo, stylized wings etched into a sunburst disc. Studio7’s private fleet. The kind of transport reserved for diplomats and legacy executives, and sometimes - freelance alchemists. 

	A red signal flickered near the forward antenna. They were descending.

Jean stepped back from the rail and grounded the cigarette on the deck with the heel of his boot. He took the suitcase in one hand, straightened his collar, and adjusted the fall of his coat with a single shrug. From this altitude, the steppe opened up beneath them, a vast flattened stretch of high desert slick with glass-smooth plateaus. The Research Annex rose like a set piece carved from a more expensive dream, a layered sprawl of fused concrete and reactive polymer wrapped in mirrored shielding. The sun didn’t reflect off it, it avoided it.

The closer they came, the more visible the facility became. The perimeter was marked by slow-circling drones and automated gun towers. Motionless from above. Predatory, but bored. Beyond that, terraces of cobalt glasswork and wind barriers led into the central domes, each marked with a different Studio7 glyph artifacts of whatever their internal departments now called themselves.

You could see everything from up here. The sprawling mining gridlines of the Peruvian Isles to the northwest, each sector lit by its own color-coded haze of energy emission. The glint of shielded convoys hauling harvested ore to offshore silos. The burning crucibles of the cobalt sifters below casting long shadows into the morning mist.

This whole stretch of the continent had been rewritten. A messy history painted over in highrise complexes. So many of what used to be Argentina and Bolivia having been terraformed into kilometer wide lakes and inlets from all sides. Most of this continent was dragged into the sea well over a hundred years ago.

The Wasp touched down with a surgeon's grace, magnetic clamps locking into a private docking pad that unfolded from the northern terrace of the compound.

Two of Studio7’s handlers were already waiting as Jean disembarked. Taking the descending microbot stairs with a confident cat-like grace. He scanned the two with a wholly disinterested gaze. Both wore matching uniforms, tight black synthleather and silver visors. Faces unreadable behind mirrored plates. They didn’t greet him so much as expect him. One stepped forward to take the suitcase.

Jean paused and met the visor dead on. “Careful,” he said. His voice was smooth, almost too precise. Each word clipped as if measured. “The contents are calibrated. If you compromise the seals, it will take me days to reset the system's stasis.”

The handler nodded, more mechanical than reassured and giving a subtle nervous glance to the other. They proceeded to carry the case as if it were primed to explode.

Jean glided across the landing pad with a fluid carelessness, taking in the breadth of the landing zone. The air here was thinner. High altitude, probably intentional. Made the staff a little slower, easier to control. The wind snapped at his coat as if in protest.

The second handler fell into step beside him. “Mr. Moreaux, the director will meet you after decontamination and initial intake.”

Jean nodded without breaking stride. “I assume my clearance has already been authenticated?”

“Yes, sir.”

“And the equipment manifests were processed without objection?”

The handler hesitated. “No objections on file.”

Jean smiled faintly. “Good. Let’s keep it that way.”

They passed through a series of pressurized gates, each one scanning his bio-signature and neural telemetry. He offered no resistance. That was the trick, compliance gave you room to maneuver later. Control required patience.

Inside the facility, the color drained from the world. The hallways were surgical and pale, white-light panels embedded in the floor and ceiling. Noise was absorbed, not echoed. Deafening walkways designed to silence doubt.

A thin smell of ozone clung to the walls.

He passed offices where no one looked up. Scientists bent over tables full of unlabeled parts. Screens streamed footage of anonymous subjects in isolated rooms. The kind of footage you didn’t need a release form for. The kind that didn’t make it into the public holofeeds.

Eventually, the hallway opened into a reception dome lit by a cascade of artificial sunlight projected through a lattice of ceiling panels. Ornamental plants in transparent nutrient tanks lined the edges. A convincing illusion of peace.

A tall and slender astrly staffer with subtle designer audio resonant augments and a Studio7 crest over her left breast approached him with a tablet. “Mr. Moreaux, you’ll be assigned to Dome Theta for your residency. Your quarters are already stocked with your requested inventory. Do you have dietary or biome requests we should update?”

Jean offered her the trace of a smile. “Nothing beyond the list I sent prior. Unless the kitchen here has learned to make real coffee.”

The staffer blinked. “I’ll note the request. My superiors had brought your appreciation for the… Antiquated - to my attention.”

	Jean’s eyes drifted casually over the Astryl’s figure, scanning her identification shard in a less than subtly glow of blue, before meeting her gaze once again. 

“Lead the way Serin.”

Jean followed Serin out of the reception dome, the convincingly warm  false sunlight drifting behind them. Her unblemished skin held a soft bronze glow, a hue rarely seen among the uppercast Astryl and a hint of equatorial sunlight lost in most Astryl salons. She walked with a light, almost hesitant precision, as if every stepwas still testing the gravity on Earth. He watched the curve of her neck beneath the collar of her uniform, the faint tremor of auburn strands brushing over her augmented implant port. He offered a subconscious tilt of interest.

“You arrived on earth as an adolescent,” Jean stated matter of factly. “That must have been disorienting.” 

Serin nodded, smoothing out the skirt of her uniform, slightly disarmed. Not by Jean’s knowledge of this, or even the casual nature of discussing what predicament landed her here. Every human wanted to know why an Astryl would choose to stay on earth even in cities like Silicon where they reach close to the majority of population in some regions. What caught Serin off guard was Jean’s tone. Lacking the expectancy and judgement she had come accustomed to from most visitors. Or even the blatant insinuations she would hear from the adult film producers who clogged the halls during the spring fashion season. 

“It was. I was fourteen. Studio7 sponsored my education at their lunar colony, and then on earth. I adapted.” She glanced sideways at him, expression both polite and curious. 

“Admirable,” Jean replied. “Few Astryl of your generation gain true fluency in terran dialects and customs.” he paused at a junction and pretended to consider the signposts. “I’ve always found cultural immersion to be… enlightening” 

The walked past corridors lined with concealed panels and diagnostic ports. Serin led him through corridors marked with alpha-numeric glowing placards: Theta-7, Theta-9, and the unmarked blank doors. Jean followed her gait, observing the structural indicators and the faint hum on construction behind certain doors. 

“I’m glad you asked about Earth,” she said, easing her voice into a conversational tone. “So many people think Astryl can’t adapt. But Earth reshaped me. Although these days, I do prefer my routines. A bolt tight schedule, visible metrics. Not the swirling calculations.” 

Jean smiled. “There is clarity in that. Though, I suspect on Earth, you also learned its best to wield that clarity to your advantage.”

Her eyes twitched just a fraction. “Perhaps… I learned to be tactful.” 

They paused by a window overlooking the expansive rainforest steppes beyond the facility. The steel ribs of the new dome under construction pierced the sky like skeletal arms. Crane booms flexed overhead. Half-finished domed panels lay in orderly stacks on the ground outside. Through the viewport, blueprints and ground teams were visible. 

Jean allowed his gaze to linger on the developing structure. A thin smile, “That’s one of our new expansion projects?” 

Serin followed his gaze, only now realizing how focused she was on how sharp and natural his features appeared even for a highborn human.” Yes. That’s Dome Zeta. It is not yet operational. Still under construction, and security details don’t want to advertise it.”

He nodded thoughtfully, “Understandable. But construction would have to be phased carefully. Temperatures, structural integrity, Internal vibro-diagnostics.”

She raised an eyebrow at that. “You follow engineering specs?”

“No, but I can understand protocols for high-zone builds. Stress fracturing. Load distribution.” He tilted his head. “I find predictive modeling fascinating. There’s a sort of beauty in structure…”

Serin gave the distracted Alchemist a thoughtful look. “I couldn’t agree more.”

She smiled, evidently pleased by his gesturing towards technical acuity. “So you have reviewed the plans?”

Jean shook his head gently. “I’ve only been offered summary’s at my clearance. But you have obviously done well here.” He pivoted subtly toward an unmarked service elevator nestled behind a curtain of neutral-tone drapes, masked beneath a sign reading “Utility Access / Environmental Control Panel.” He activated a hidden hololink near the frame with a silent access code hack. The only indication that any tampering had taken place, a subtle tired feeling behind his eyes. “If we’re heading toward Thera… We could take this lift instead.”

Sering hesitated, then stepped inside. “This lift is reserved for the environmental staff-”

He waved her concern away. “I’m sure no one will mind.” His voice was soft but assured. “Less public traffic.” 

She followed. 

Inside, the cab was narrow and lined with technical relays. As the descended, Jean continued casually. 

“So, Lunar Strand Grammar. That dialect certainly has its quirks.”

Serin chuckled quietly. “Worse than you imagine. I had to re-learn vowels.” 

“Impressive to master two polytonal dialects. You must be exceptional at interface calibration.”

She monitored his form, perhaps checking for insincerity. When the lift came to rest the doors opened not into Dome Theta but a steel-framed corridor lit with a softer violet glow. 

Jean stepped off of the pressurized lift into the dim violet glow of the corridor, the vaulted panels casting soft waves across the instrumentation vents. The air here smelled faintly of ozonized coolant and steel common to modern construction zones. A smell he had come to find oddly reassuring.

Serin followed Jean’s confident stride out of the lift. She paled slightly as she glanced around. “Mr. Moreaux.. I-this is not the Dome Theta corridor.” 

Jean turned on his heel and offered her a formal nod. “I do see that. It seems I was so captivated by our conversation that I failed to realize the signage.”

Her face tightened. She looked past him toward identical halls branching off. Panic edged her voice. “This wing is, these tracks connect only to Zeta. Security review will be questioning our unscheduled routing.”

Jean gave a light laugh. “You are correct. I suppose I was entirely preoccupied with your insights.”

She sighed a flush rising to her cheeks. “I am sorry. I didn’t realize…”

Jean smiled broader, leaning casually against the handrail, voice velvet. “Please. Don’t trouble yourself. The route is entirely my oversight. Your guidance was impeccable.”

Serin looked into his eyes searching for a test or trap. Finding nothing in his tone, she relaxed fractionally. “Thank you.”

The elevator doors slid closed behind them. Jean Inclined his head toward the corridor’s end, before starting down the corridor. 

Serin followed a few steps behind, adjusting the fit of her uniform, a gentle tension in her posture. She carried the poise of one raised under scrutiny. When she spoke, her voice was calm, clipped but polite.

“I truly did not mean to mislead you,” she said, escorted in his wake.

Jean Tilted his head respectfully. “I suspected as much. The conversation simply pulled us off route.”

Serin’s eyes flickered. “You’re very gracious.”

“When one speaks with someone with a truly cosmopolitan history, grace comes naturally.”

She paused then, walking slightly side by side along the corridor as two more workers scurried past them, uniforms mismatched, and spine implants humming quietly. She observed him carefully. 

“You know I was born on the Mars Colony, not the lunar colony,” she said slowly, glancing at him. “My father, he led a Mars Assembly party that fell apart with the establishment of equality laws imposed by the Unity Mandates.”

Jean waited, letting her offer the next thought. 

“I never agreed with him on principle,” She continued. “He was rigid. His ideals were colonial. Astryl superiority over hypomorph and Bioware. But he was still my father. And my mother, well she at least balanced him. She was a bioengineer. A bioware specialist, and had more empathy than he could tolerate. They sent me to Earth through Studio7 hoping I'd escape factionalism.”

Jean’s gaze softened. “It sounds like you grew up as a diplomat of sorts. Having to straddle worlds.”

She nodded. Her stride slowed. “On Mars, our colony was more open and equality was accepted as institutional policy. We had humans, astryl, hypomorphs, bioware, all as equals in our schools. Factories. Research labs. My father’s party opposed it. But the colony endured. The backlash broke them. And then I was sent away.”

“And your path took you here, to Earth, under cinematic auspices.”

“Yes.”

They reached a turn in the corridor. She paused back toward him.”I never went to Titan. I only learned Astryl dialect and lineage through the corporate schooling, and Pureblood translations.”

Jean came closer, lowering his voice. “That makes you all the more fascinating. You represent terrestrial adaptation from a cosmic vantage. You refused the prejudice your father wielded but carried the genes… Brave.”

She blinked, a faint flush blooming across her bronze cheeks. “Thank you.”

Silence draped around them. The hum of nearby cooling vents deepened, and distant mechanical excavators behind grated panels pulsed in tempo to their heartbeats. 

Jean allowed his attention to drift momentarily to the construction zone beyond the reinforced viewport. The metallic frame of Dome Zeta glinted in the synthetic outdoor lighting. Blueprints scrawled across a heads-up monitor hovered discreetly near Serin’s hip.

“You’re assigned this expansion?” He asked lightly.

She nodded. “Project liaison. Field data, access manifests, build status. Design Coordination.”

He paused. “It’s admirable. Thermal gradients funneling through radial support systems. Vapor resistances… I’ve studied structurally similar builds but you clearly have good taste.”

She tilted her head, surprised. “You’ve studied data on terrestrial science?”

Jean smiled slightly. “I pay attention to architecture for their protocol logic. I find your dome’s load metrics particularly… elegant.”

She let out a small laugh. “That’s quite a compliment.”

Serin walked him the rest of the way through the sealed corridor, their footsteps muffled by the soft thermal composite padding laid temporarily along the floor. As they rounded another bend, the lighting dimmed and warmed to a sepia tone, one of the newly-installed lumen cycles intended to simulate a dusklike ambience during off-work hours. Ahead, a modest brass-inlaid panel announced: **Studio7 Private Accommodations – Sector V1**.

She turned to him again, lingering at the threshold. “Your quarters are through here,” she said, voice more reserved now. “You'll find the environmental parameters already matched to your biosignature.”

“Very kind of you,” Jean replied. “I’ll be quite comfortable, I’m sure.”

She hesitated, eyeing his face again—almost as if trying to decide if she should say something more. But she didn’t. She gave a slight, professional nod and turned.

He watched her leave, waiting until the corridor was silent before stepping forward. The access reader shimmered green as it matched the biometric trace already encoded into the system by his arrival dossier. The door clicked open on a pneumatic hiss. 

The suite was luxurious by most operational standards. Sleek basalt walls. Modular windows rimmed in an antiglare polymer. A suspended sleep frame drifted weightlessly above a recessed control pit. A kinetic desk lay folded against the wall, inactive, its dark surface free of fingerprints. Near the back, the embedded wash-cycle panel gleamed with a full-body rejuvenator array. It was a clear indicator that this was one of Studio7’s flagship suites. 

Jean took it all in at a glance. But it was the silence that most assured him.

He walked towards the briefcase that had been brought to his room, lifting it and carrying it to the center plinth. He brushed its surface with familiar reverence. His movements were efficient, never rushed. He tapped a sequence along its edge. The security seals chirped. The latch slid open with the sound of breath escaping a lung.

Inside, carefully nestled between stacks of alchemical instruments, vials of memory-reactive fluid, and packets of ceramic shielding, sat a matte-black arachnid form no larger than a teacup. Its legs were slender, folding into the body like wires braided around a gemstone. At his tough, the spider stirred.

“Wake,” he said quietly.

The spider flicked its legs out, whirring softly, its head rotating on a micro-gimbal as eight ocular slits pulsed red. It skittered up his forearms briefly before leaping off and landing on the far wall. Within moments it had disappeared into a vent. 

Jean stood, turning slowly as a faint digital feed shimmered into existence over the kinetic desk. A schematic view of the suite blinked into place, each surface marked with signal traces, and heat residue from recent intrusions.

His friend was already at work.

Jean watched the Synth bioware maneuver along the ceiling, spooling a web of microscopic film along one of the embedded wall joints. The listening devices, five of them, standard corporate issue, flashed green in his display as the spider temporarily severed their feeds and replaced them with a precompiled archive of innocuous activity. Looping white noise. Shower cycles. Synthetic sighs and the occasional faint hum of someone reviewing research documents.

The mimic-feed would be imperceptible to remote security unless they deployed a physical scrub team. Which they wouldn’t. Not until he failed to smile politely at the next daily sync.

He exhaled slowly and opened a discreet holodeck tablet embedded in the kinetic desk’s corner.

  


**Secure Channel Established**

**User: Hemlock**

**Status: Synchronized**

He dictated softly, his voice never above the ambient hum of the filtration unit. “Dome Zeta is nearing post-construction viability. Exterior plating complete. Internal conduits are active, at least to eighty-four percent per my observation. Project liaison unaware of full clearance tier applied to construction route. Subnet reports were accurate. No scheduled PR cycle yet. Recommend soft surveillance only until internal security posts are finalized.”

He paused and leaned forward, inputting a few glyph-coded directives that shimmered and vanished once registered.

A tired voice responded. “Confirm whether Studio7 intends to divert raw processing from the Chilean Strip directly to Zeta. Structural load design suggests high-volume transit. Potential distribution node.”

The console chirped. A pulse confirmation blinked twice before vanishing.

Jean leaned back, rubbed the edge of his jaw thoughtfully.

He closed the console with a gentle wave of his hand.

Outside the window, across the distant expanse, the luminous skeleton of Dome Zeta stood against the dark horizon like the ribcage of a slumbering colossus. Serin hadn’t realized how much she had shown him. Not quite. She would likely wonder later, retracing her steps, uncertain when exactly the conversation had changed direction or how she’d found herself walking away from her assigned route.

Jean didn’t blame her. It was what he did.

It was not espionage in the classical sense. Not yet. It was an observation. Collection. Preventative precision.

He turned and unfastened his jacket with a practiced hand. Beneath the collar, a second port glimmered. A low-profile implant with trace alchemic augmentation built into the surrounding skin. Not visible to most scans, and entirely absent from his public profile. The port pulsed gently, synchronizing with the small array inside the suitcase. A slow, warm current passed between them. Temperature calibration. Memory archive. System purge. Status: optimal.

“Very good,” Jean murmured.

Behind him, the spider reappeared on the lip of the suitcase and folded itself down with a near-silent click. Its optics blinked twice before fading dark.

Jean pressed the suitcase lid closed.

He crossed to the window. From this angle, the curvature of the nearby Peruvian isle domes gleamed under a faint atmospheric shield. Farther east, the transport lines that fed into the Chilean Strip shimmered like nerve endings in a biomechanical organism alive, coiled, endlessly moving.

The world below was made of engines and policy and breath. Jean saw it all.

But he also saw the fault lines, the seams that power tried to hide.

He would find the cracks again.

Not because I was lazy, but because I had sticky notes everywhere, reminders in 4 apps, and a brain that was constantly overloaded. I tried using digital calendars, bullet journals, even those aesthetic Notion templates... Nothing stuck. 😅

So over the summer, I decided to build my *own* student planner — exactly how *I* needed it:

✅ Monthly + weekly views (because I need to zoom in and out)  
✅ Assignment + homework trackers that don’t feel like extra work  
✅ Semester overview (for seeing all my exams in one place)  
✅ Budget tracker (because I always forget what I spend on textbooks and coffee)  
✅ Notes pages and space to breathe (not just plan every second of my life)

I made it printable (US Letter & A4) so I can keep it in a binder, and I even use it on my iPad with GoodNotes now.

I’ve shared it with a few friends, and they told me I should put it out there for other students — so I did. If anyone’s looking for a simple but complete planner for 2026, here it is:

1mmx8pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1mmx8pc/syringe_feeding_when_to_let_go/,Syringe feeding - when to let go?,"Hi everyone. Going through a tough time. This post is going to be a bit all over the place. 

My wife and I adopted our cat 8 years ago, 9 months into our relationship, a month before we got married. She was one of a litter of 4, from a stray that my friend took in from the street when he noticed she was pregnant.

This cat is our mutual soulmate. She was so quick to learn everything, never caused problems, never had any behavioral issues. Literally the perfect pet. And she’s the most beautiful, affectionate, and wise pet we could have ever asked for.

We regularly took her to the vet, and everything was always fine. She was always very calm and accepting when she had to get vaccinated. They were always commending how healthy her teeth and gums were - she was on a 80/20 diet of dry vs wet food.

In 2023 she started having chronic problems with vomiting immediately after meals. She would scarf down any wet food we gave her, and the vet was suspicious of food allergies, so we switched her to a diet of Royal Canine sensitive food and other assorted veterinary gastrointestinal diets. There were lots of ups and downs, but we kept getting assured that her vomiting was caused by her rapid consumption, since the food always came out exactly how it looked when we gave it to her. Soon after, she started mostly avoiding dry food, so her diet was flipped, 80% wet, 20% dry. She had always had dry food in her bowl, and she would generally never overeat, and paced herself. 

In December 2024, we noticed a small lump in her belly, about the size of a pea. Upon examination, they were telling us it was likely a gastrointestinal tumor, and recommended surgery to remove it. At the same time, she was tested and as it turns out, she was FIV+, likely from birth, inheriting it from her mother, since she was strictly an indoor cat and had never really come into close contact with any other animals.

On recommendation from several friends who are practicing vets, we opted against the surgery, since she apparently had a low chance of recovering from the invasive surgery. They basically threatened us that if we didn’t do the surgery, she may have a few weeks left.

We switched vet clinics, and took her to the premier specialist for cats in our city (and much wider).

They were appalled at how neglectful the previous clinic was in terms of preventative care - that we had been clients for several years and just now found out that she was FIV+ was insane, and they quickly established that she was infected with a parasite - likely for a prolonged period of time (1+ years) - Which was probably the cause of the vomiting. That issue was quickly resolved via medication and she soon stopped having any problems with food consumption.

However, due to the length of time she was vomiting, her intestinal lining was 3x as thick as normal - meaning that nutrient absorption was heavily impaired. Further examination showed that the tumor was growing, and she was soon diagnosed with lymphoma, in April this year, 4 months after the previous clinic said she would’ve passed. After a brief period of stabilization, they put her on prednisolone, and about a month later she started chemo with chlorambucil mid-May. Ondansetron for nausea caused by the chemo, mirataz for appetite as needed. 

She bounced back, and everything seemed good - she was drinking a lot of water, but that was to be expected due to the medication and her condition, and was generally taken as a good thing, she’s staying hydrated. The only problem was that her kidneys had started swelling - also an expected side effect of the prednisolone. However, things were good - she was playful, cuddly, hung out with us, followed us around the house, being her usual self - until about 10 days ago. 

She had been losing weight slowly but steadily for a while, and looking back now, we most regret not looking for a different clinic, or finding this current vet years ago. Her weight was slowly declining since the vomiting started, and looking at the history, it’s so obvious.. from 4.4kg, to 3.8, 3.6, 3.3, 3.1, and finally stabilizing at 2.9 throughout the last year. 

She’s stopped eating 10 days ago, and we’ve been feeding her Hill’s urgent care food via syringe. But she’s made a complete 180 in terms of behavior - isolating, not looking for us, not being around us, not interested in food. She’s still drinking, and I’m trying to stay positive that the urgent food will help. We took her to an emergency clinic last Saturday, and they gave her some SubQ fluids, but the doctor was.. not optimistic. One kidney is deformed, but both are swollen.

Last Tuesday, we went to see her oncologist. She had a seizure in the vet’s office, which was terrifying. They checked her ultrasound, and the kidneys were in a dire state. She still didn’t seem to be in any pain, however. Later that night, she had another brief seizure, but hasn’t had another since. She was 2kg at that last checkup. 

She’s been urinating more frequently, smaller amounts than before, mostly using the litterbox, but she’s had multiple accidents over the last few days, wetting the bed or the towels we’ve laid out for her to lay on. We’ve been carrying her to the litterbox several times a day, cleaning up right away. 

She’s having a few good moments every day, but still spends the majority of time in a separate room, or in the bathroom under the sink (it’s fairly warm there on account of pipes and the washing machine). 

The nights where it’s bad.. She stumbles a bit. Her back legs are thin and wobbly. Last night she made a few steps and just laid down by the door frame, not able to fully enter the bedroom. 
She’s mostly stopped grooming, though over the weekend we noticed her cleaning her paws and her belly, as well as her behind. 

I’m painfully aware that time is running out.

My wife and I have had multiple breakdowns since that appointment at the 24/7 clinic. I can’t imagine life without her. She’s my partner, and my wife’s as well. She’s a part of everything we do at home, and she’s saved both of us so many times. When I was alone because my wife had to travel back to our home country to wait for a visa. When my wife was alone while I was working night shifts. Whenever we were sad, tired, hurting, she knew, and she was there to heal us. Every morning when I was spent, coming home from working all night, she’d be at the window waiting for me to show up behind the corner, and running to greet me at the door.

She’d sleep with us, watch tv by our side, lie on my arm while gaming, lie beneath my computer screen while I was making music, sit on my speakers while I was mixing, sit with my wife on her laptop while she was working, she was always there whenever we were cooking, or making coffee in the morning, or when I was on the balcony smoking, sprawl over our backs while we’re at the table eating, she’d watch us and play with us when we’re doing workouts, hang out with all our friends and family when they visited.. Everyone absolutely loves her, and there’s no end to the stories of how many of our loved ones are impressed at how loving she is. So many people who aren’t usually cat lovers took to her. Whenever we started packing to go somewhere, we’d open the suitcase and she’d be the first to jump in, as if to say, “Your essentials are ready.” We always joked that it was her house, we were just paying rent.

I’m beyond worried that she may have crossed the threshold to the point of no return, and that there’s no hope for her, even with treatment. She’s already lived 9 months longer than the first vet was giving her, but an eternity would be too short, let alone a few months, weeks, or even days.

My wife and I were both saying that we don’t even know how it is to be married without her. She was there for all of our firsts, for every big thing in our life - our first apartment, our first move, our marriage, our first new country, our first jobs, our first car, our first every-habit-either-of-us-have. We were always dreaming of her meeting our first child together, moving into our first home, being an integral part of, well, everything that is to come.

We’re having a lot of back and forth about whether it’s time to help her rest. She still seems to have some fight in her, and surprises us by jumping up to sleep in some of her favorite places, or chasing down a butterfly in the house. She really enjoys being groomed with her favorite brush. She rubs her head against us while we’re grooming her, and lifts her chin and purrs when we scratch her. She doesn’t complain and seems fairly happy during feeding time, but if we stopped syringe feeding, she’d starve. She started cleaning up in her litterbox again today, after days of just jumping out without any “digging”. 

Despite these few glimmers of hope, it feels like she’s not really enjoying much else. Still not coming to sit with us, except at bedtime. 
It feels impossible to decide what’s best for her. I’m afraid to make a decision if there’s still hope, but we’ve agreed that we don’t want to stress her out with any further vet appointments. 

How can I gauge what to do, when every time it feels like she’s done, she surprises me with some new hope, some semblance of normal? 

To whoever takes the time to read through this, I thank you for your time and compassion. 

There’s no way I can put into words what she represents in my and our lives. I only hope I did right by her.

I wouldn’t even call us FWBs honestly. We were friendly in that we could totally chill, chat, watch a movie or something after fucking, but the relationship was fundamentally sexual. We weren’t going out to the movies, doing social stuff with mutual friends or really anything outside of banging each other’s brains out within the confines of our respective apartments. We had sort of an unspoken understanding that we were each other’s convenient go-to whenever we were in-between serious relationships. A warm body and company to meet sexual needs when we didn’t have a girl/boyfriend. 

We did that for years till I got into a 5 year relationship that I recently got out of. During that time, we were never in contact. I’m single again and I reached out to her. I figured it had been forever and who knows if our old arrangement still applies after all that time, but give it a shot. She was glad to hear from me after so long but said she’s in a “pretty serious relationship at the moment.” She said she would be up to meet up for coffee though and catch up. I said fine, couldn’t hurt. I take her at her word and believe her, but a buddy who’s known our whole situation since the very beginning raised two points that have me thinking a little bit. 

First, he says how “serious” can her current relationship be if she’s meeting up with a guy who has never been anything to her but dick on demand and who reached out to her explicitly looking to fuck? Basically, if she’s really in a serious relationship then meeting up with me would be hella disrespectful to it, so she can’t be that serious about it. 

Second, we’ve never had a “let’s get coffee” kinda relationship and she knows that. The deal has always been “if we’re both available, let’s fuck. If one of us isn’t, see you when you’re free.” He thinks she’s using this coffee meet up as a vibe check after such a long time since we’ve seen each other. Like she’s still interested, but wants to see if there’s still an attraction or doesn’t want to seem TOO available after I hit her up out of the blue after so long or something.

Again, I’m inclined to just believe what she said, but I see his point. Could there actually be something to what he’s saying? I don’t really think so, but I kind of hope there is if I’m being honest.

We pretty easily dialed in our coffee and have enjoyed good to decent espresso ever since, frequently better than any cafes we stop at during travels. 

The problem is that the machine seems to be broken/breaking as the shots are noticeably decreasing in quality. (It looks like the pressure regulator is broken and the shot is pushed at full power the whole time)

The question is where to go from here?

We tried just buying another one, but apparently they released a  new revision 3, and it is just absolutely useless.  The grinder can’t even do filter sizes and it’s waaaay louder, and when you grind it near espresso sizes or use an external grinder, the new pump can’t even get a drip of coffee through the beans. It is truly ruined and enshitified.

We primarily make lattes and americanos so we’d love to get a semi-auto that can do these without additional steps. Just a direct 1-to-1 replacement.

I wasn't quite sure when I started to rant. Somewhere between pouring my cereal, tapping on Imogen’s Instagram profile, and seeing her latest post. But it was too late to stop now. 

“Even if I *did* want to destroy my body to give you the grandchildren I supposedly owe you, I’d rather not bring them into a world that doesn’t give a fuck about them.”

Mom, lips curved around the rim of her coffee mug, rolled her eyes.

“Sienna, sweetheart,” she fixed me with a disappointed glare. “It’s a ***job***. I wasn’t asking for a lecture.” 

Her gaze flicked to her phone screen. “You don’t need to like children.” 

She held it up so I could see. “Three five-year-olds. There’s an option to sleep over, and she's offering $350 per child.”

That got my attention.

Sure, I disliked kids, but not kids collectively. It depends on how they were raised. 

Take my little step brother Rayleigh, for example. 

Insufferable iPad baby. 

Every time I visited my step mom, there he sat, cross-legged on the floor, hypnotized by the screen while she played ‘Mother Of The Year.’ 

Which was ironic, since SpongeBob was actually putting in all the work. 

He is now the devil incarnate. 

When I threatened to break his Switch because he wouldn't give it back, he burst into tears and told her I tried to push him down the stairs.

I haven't been invited back.

But… “Wait, $350 *each?*” I feigned disinterest, stirring my cereal into a soupy mess. I was *slightly* intrigued. Begrudgedly.

My phone lit up with a notification. Imogen. 

I averted my gaze, my stomach twisting.

That much per child? That was diabolical. Either the mom was like *rich* rich, or the kids were hell’s offspring.

Mom raised her brows over her phone, sipping her coffee with one hand and scrolling with the other. 

She looked almost triumphant, a smile creeping onto her lips, like babysitting three brats could single-handedly change my stance on motherhood. 

“Oh, *now* you're interested?” Mom handed me her phone, and I took it, hesitatently. “There's the address. I saw a boy around your age already commented, so be quick.” She leaned back. “As for the lecture, sweetie, you know at some point, you will be expected to have children.”

Her words were like needle pricks in my spine. I ignored her, just like I did when I was a teenager, and started scrolling through the comments. 

Sure enough, a recent college graduate named Sam, with a degree in nursing and the typing style of an MLM victim (Hi! 🙋 I'm Sam! 👀), had already attached his extensive résumé. 

I disliked his comment, and, remembering I was on my mom's account, panicked and undid it.

The post itself was simple, from one Sunny Hawthorne, whose profile picture was a horse: “Working Mama needs a night babysitter to look after my three BEAUTIFUL angels.”

(Will pay EXTRA if you can start tonight.) 

(Three well-behaved, five year old darlings who you will immediately fall in love with!) 

I tapped her profile. 

Private. 

You'd think she'd be posting these “beautiful darlings” publically. 

“Sienna.” Mom said. She had that tone again. 

Like when I hit twenty, and she immediately started hinting she wanted to be a grandmother one day. 

The emotional manipulation was fucking exhausting. 

But she continued. Because, living under her roof, my mother was entitled to constantly remind me of *her* wishes. 

“Your body is a clock. Remember that. I would love to have a little Sienna running around my house.”

""I'm a lesbian,"" I muttered, texting myself the address and all but tossing her phone at her. 

Mom drained her coffee. ""I'll pay for your IVF.”

I pointedly ignored that, jumping to my feet. “Babysitting sounds more fun than this! Can I borrow the car?” 

Another text from Imogen lit up my screen. I swiped it away.

Mom didn’t even look at me, picking at her pancakes. 

Sitting there in her silk gown, completely financially stable, in a house she was lucky to have, with her biggest problems being that her book club got canceled, or running late for her two-hundred-dollar manicure. Infuriating.

“Of course,” she said, her attention already reclaimed by Facebook. “By the way, Imogen called.”

Even when I was a kid, I never cried in front of Mom. I had a foolproof technique: pressing my knuckles into my eyes until the tears disappeared. 

Hiding it as an adult was harder.

Imogen was the one who brought up having kids at twenty-two, even though she knew how I felt. She said we could make it work, and I wanted to believe her. 

But neither of us had stable jobs. 

We shared that opinion until, one day, my ex-girlfriend got brainwashed by my crazy mother and suddenly wanted a huge family.

And I didn’t.

So, that was that.

My throat closed up, my eyes stinging, chest aching. Suffocation wasn't an unfamiliar feeling, a hollow, agonizing *something* I couldn’t name twisting in my chest and bleeding into my stomach. 

Heartache, frustration, and the weight on my shoulders that wouldn’t let me breathe.

I ran out of the kitchen, pushing my knuckles into my eyes, and when that didn't work, squeezed my nose until my silent sobs subsided. 

I left the house with a bitter taste in my mouth. 

Mom’s words trailed after me, a stagnant stench of familiar disappointment in the air that I couldn't escape. 

*“You know she loves you, Sienna. I think the two of you should talk. Imogen is the smart one, remember.”*

I was slowly coming to the realization that I no longer wanted my Mom in my life. 

As if she'd sprinkled her Mom magic into my cereal, my opinion on motherhood shifted the moment I met the Hawthorne children—for maybe two fucking seconds. 

The Hawthorne home was exactly what I expected. Just one in a long line of picturesque, white-picket-fence, nuclear-family cookie cutters, straight out of the 1950s.

I slipped on Mom’s heels, tugged open the perfectly painted white gate, and clacked my way to the door. 

Taking a few deep breaths, I mentally rehearsed my greeting one last time: *“Hi! I’m Sienna! I adore children!”*

I knocked, my heart beating out of my chest. 

“Come on in!” a cheery voice called from inside. 

The door swung open, and I was greeted by the blaring sound of what seemed to be a YouTube video playing at tinnitus-inducing volume. 

I took an uncertain step over the threshold, nearly tripping over a boy who was frantically trying to make his great escape to the porch.

For a moment, just a moment, my cynicism about motherhood shattered, and I was left wondering if maybe Mom was right. That motherly instinct she always talked about, what I thought was BS. 

Was that what was coming over me? A sudden, almost feral urge to scoop up the little boy and swing him around. 

He was the cutest thing I'd ever seen: a curly mess of brunette tangles I immediately wanted to ruffle. 

When I saw cute things, whether that was cats, baby animals, or miniature objects, I immediately had a baby-voice on standby. 

He was no exception. Chubby cheeks, wide brown eyes, and the adorablest  little scowl on his face as he blinked up at me.

The kid’s frantic eyes flashed behind me as he made a desperate attempt to crawl through my legs. I smiled down at him. 

“Hello.” I forced a big, friendly smile, but the boy’s eyes popped open, his nostrils flared. This kid looked pissed. 

Like, ready-to-tantrum pissed. I understood why parents were so obsessed with keeping their kids close. 

Little ones really did try to toddle straight out the front door. 

On instinct, I bent down and lifted him into my arms. 

He yelped, squirming in my grip and battering me with his fists. “Let go of me!”

I held onto him, trying to calm the tantrum. But then, the little shit spat in my face. 

I was not expecting this five year old kid to look me directly in the eyes, his little face scrunched up, tears streaming down his cheeks. 

I was expecting some kind of fit, but this kid was absolutely pissed. 

He swung his head around, trying to tear out of my arms, his little fingers reaching for the door. 

“I said, let me go!” he screamed, battering me with his fists. “Let me *go*, bitch!”

I almost dropped him. 

“Hey,” I whispered, trying to calm him. I was surprised by my own soothing tone, but it seemed to anger him even more, sending him into hysterics. “Your mommy invited me,” I told him. “It's okay, sweetie.”

The kid's gaze snapped to me. And it was so fast, his head jerking almost inhumanly, a shiver slid down my spine. His eyes were narrowed. Challenging. 

“*Is* it?” he spat in my face yet again, and I got a mouthful of saliva. I  found myself speechless. 

“Let me go,” he squirmed, holding my gaze for way longer than necessary. His lip quirked. “Let me go or I start *screaming*.”

I debated putting him down. Was he actually *threatening* me right now? 

I knew five-year-olds were growing up in a different generation to me, but I was pretty sure they weren't threatening their parents.

Before I could try and bargain with this kid, because making him cry was not a good look, he burst into an uncontrollable fit, and I panicked, letting him hit me in the face. 

“I see you've met Kazaria,” a woman in her forties, with gaunt cheeks and hollow eyes, greeted me with a tired smile. 

Sunny Hawthorne was pretty much exactly what I expected: a wiry woman in her mid-forties in a sculpted floral dress with a strict blonde ponytail. 

She gently scooped her screeching son out of my arms and set him down. Kazaria stopped crying. 

His gaze flashed to the front door, and his mother let it swing shut. He shot me one last piercing glare, before scurrying away.

“Kazaria is… scared of new people,” Sunny explained, her smile growing wider. I noticed half of her teeth were missing. 

“Ah, and look who else has come to see you!” she laughed. 

Something hit me in the stomach, and I jumped, looking down at a girl about the same age as Kazaria, with wild curls hanging in her eyes. 

I wasn't expecting to be brutally judged by a five-year-old. “Who are *you*?” the little girl demanded, folding her arms.

Her stance reminded me of my mom when she was irritated. 

Hand on hip, head slightly tilted. Her eyes shot to Mrs Hawthorne, narrowing. Wow. This kid looked like she called the shots. 

“You *know* my brothers don't like new people,” she scowled at her mother before grabbing my bag I’d just plopped down. 

The girl shoved it into my chest hard enough to hurt, making me stumble back out of the door. “You can go now.”

“Melody Hawthorne!” Sunny snapped, her expression twisting. 

I noticed the little girl flinch when she raised her voice, ducking her head. 

The woman shot me an apologetic look. “You’re old enough to know that was rude! Say sorry to your babysitter!”

Melody wouldn’t meet my gaze. “She’ll scare my brothers,” she whispered, her voice choking up. 

“I don’t like her.” She put way too much emphasis on *like*, which made me consider walking away. The way she shied away from me made me wonder if I looked scary. Was I too tall?

There was no worse truth than a child’s brutal honesty, and I wasn’t exactly thrilled to look after this spoiled little brat anyway.

Her mother, however, refused to let it go. “I said,” she said in a scary, commanding tone, and the girl ducked her head further.

“Apologize.”

Melody sniffled, glaring down at the floor, gripping the material of her dress.

“Sorry,” she spat. 

Sunny planted her hands on her hips. I wondered if Melody was copying her mother. “Sweetie.” Her tone was deliciously  condescending. I was silently cheering her on. “Look your babysitter in the eye, and say you’re sorry.”

The little girl stamped her foot as if she was about to follow her brother’s footsteps. Instead, she met my gaze, her expression twitching, lips wobbling like it was physically painful for her. 

Her eyes surprised me, darker than I expected for a child, hollow, like maybe her mother wasn't as nice as I thought. 

She was trembling, fingers curled into fists. The way she swiped at her tears and tried to blink them back reminded me of my younger self.

I found my voice, strangled and small, like I was a kid again. “It’s fine!” I said, forcing a smile at Melody, effortlessly sliding into my baby voice. I knew I was grimacing. 

I knew, in some unspoken language between me and this little nightmare, that Melody could tell I wasn't playing games. 

Melody’s glare might as well have been a knife splitting open my skull. 

So sharp, so unapologetic.

“Really, it’s okay!” I insisted, lying through my teeth. “I’m sure Melody is just looking out for her brothers,” I added, smiling wider. 

The hell spawn refused to show weakness, settling on a rebellious death glare that I could have sworn *felt* physical, like laser death rays would scorch my eyes out any second. 

Melody shot a glance at her mother, who was waiting patiently, before throwing her head back and screaming, “I’m sorry!” in my face, then marching back into the house.

Sunny sighed, watching her daughter disappear down the hall in a pink huff. 

“I apologize,” she said, ushering me inside. 

I stepped in hesitantly, half expecting an ambush of killer kids. “As you can probably tell, my children are… gifted.”

I slipped out of my shoes, aware of Kazaria in the corner of my eye, glaring at me. 

The house was beautiful, warm and homely. The smell of chili drifted in from the kitchen, while the modern, minimalist décor eased the knot in my stomach. 

Sunny led me down a hallway where a staircase curved upstairs, the wall lined with framed photos of the kids all the way up. 

Sunny, of course, continued her “gifted children” rant as she led the tour.

“Melody and Kazaria both exhibit remarkable intelligence,” she went on, her voice carrying an almost narcissistic smugness. “They're already at an advanced reading level.”

I rolled my eyes. Of course these kids were baby geniuses.

“They're very different to *other* children,” she said. “I would almost say that they're child prodigies. Melody is on track for a Pulitzer Prize, while Kazaria’s art is displayed in the town gallery.” Sunny nudged me towards the staircase. 

“The downstairs bathroom is out of bounds,” she switched back to professional. “If the children need the bathroom, you will accompany them. If they protest, they lose screen time.”

Ouch. 

Admiring the hallway’s paint job, a bright, sunny yellow, I noticed, among the photos of the younger kids, an older brunette boy, teenage-aged, scowling in a private school uniform. 

He was the spitting image of his younger brother, sitting cross-legged on his bed, arms folded. I turned to Sunny. 

“Do you have older children?”

“Hmm?” Her gaze flicked briefly to the photo. “Ah, that's my eldest son,” she said, her tone softening. “I lost him a few years ago.”

Something in my gut tightened. I was half-watching Kazaria trying to act subtle, hiding behind his mother. He caught my eye, sticking out his tongue. 

“I'm so sorry for your loss,” I said. Instead of showering Mrs Hawthorne in sympathy, though, I tried a lighter tone. 

“I don’t think he liked being on camera,” I laughed. “Was he always like that?”

Sunny’s expression lit up, like she was glad I’d asked. “He was always pulling that face,” she chuckled. The way she stared longingly at her dead son choked me up. 

Kazaria was tugging at my dress, and I subtly thwacked his fists away. His mother traced her fingers over the frame, hesitantly. 

“You can’t see it, but I asked him specifically to pose in that exact spot. There’s a chocolate cupcake behind him.”

She winked at me. “Eighteen years old, and the only time he would go *near* a camera with his siblings was through bribery.” 

Her smile soured slightly. “Then, of course, he started college. And just… *threw* it all away.”

I found myself entranced by the boy in the photo, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “How did your son die?”

Suddenly, it felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room. 

Her expression darkened. She turned away from the photo. 

“Sienna, from the moment you came inside my house, you made an unspoken promise to care for and respect my children.” 

Sunny pulled the photo off the wall with a violent tug before turning back to me. “I would appreciate you staying out of my family’s business.” 

She paused, and I could see vulnerability beneath her carefully made-up facade. 

Mrs Hawthorne was slowly cracking. 

“My son died from an overdose,” she said, her voice unwavering and eerily sterile. 

“While he was extremely gifted like his siblings, my son was also a deeply damaged boy who chose to prioritize his social life over education. He did not ask for help, and died peacefully at home with his mother and siblings by his side.”

When I couldn’t find my words, she gestured toward the living room. “Shall we continue the tour, or would you like his name, too?”

Kazaria grumbled something under his breath, and I shot him a look.

“I’m sorry, ma’am,” I said, pushing my voice to sound sincere. 

Sunny shrugged. “You’re not the first, and certainly won’t be the last, to ask questions.” 

Her lips curved into a condescending smile. “I appreciate your apology! I’ll chalk this up to a simple misunderstanding. I’m sure you, unlike my children, were raised by a mother who didn't care to teach you basic manners.”

“Excuse me?” I couldn't swallow my squeak. 

Mrs. Hawthorne turned her attention to her son, bending down to ruffle his hair. 

Kazaria pushed her away, narrowing his eyes at me. 

“It’s a learning curve, Sienna,” she finished, moving back down the hallway.

“Why don't we go and meet my third and final child?”

Kazaria shot me the side-eye, letting out a quiet huff, his eyes staring daggers at his mother. 

Well, whaddya know. We had a mutual enemy. 

“Sienna.” Mrs Hawthorne snapped, hurrying me along. “Today, please.”
 
I followed her into the dining room, where Melody sat on the carpet, with a book. 

The room was charming and bright, fairy lights decorating the wall, gossamer curtains and bay windows behind a couch sitting in front of the TV, dining table on the other side. 

Another small boy sat at the table with his knees drawn to his chest, head inclined, mouth slightly open. 

He reminded me of a cherub: bright blue eyes framed by a mop of golden curls. It took me a moment to realize his vacant stare was stuck to the TV, which wasn't actually on. 

“Stevie, what did I tell you about slouching?” Sunny gently sat him up. 

I didn’t like the way his head lolled, his flickering eyes never leaving the black screen. 

She shook him, and the boy snapped out of it, his eyes lazily rolling to me before almost popping out of his head. 

He jerked to a sitting position. 

“Holy *fuck*,” the little boy blinked rapidly at me. “Who's *she*?”

Next to me, Kazaria burst into giggles, and I had to bite down on my lower lip. 

Melody, hiding behind her upside down book, let out a snort, her shoulders shaking.

A scarlet blush flooded Mrs. Hawthorne’s cheeks. ""Stevie,"" she spoke calmly, maintaining her perfect smile. “What did we talk about?”

Stevie groaned, tipping his head back. Kazaria, who'd dived onto the couch next to him, giggled. “Think before I speak.” 

Mrs Hawthorne’s expression hardened. “Think before I speak, *what?*”

The boy buried his head in his knees, grumbling, “Think before I speak, *Mommy.*""

Mrs Hawthorne straightened up, turning her attention to me. “Stevie has what we call a photographic memory for vocabulary. He picks up *anything* he hears, and can mimic it.” Her smile curdled. 

“That, of course, *includes* curse words.”

She didn’t give me a chance to respond, and I was still struggling to come to terms with a five-year-old cursing like a teenager.

“All right, that concludes the tour. I think that’s everything!”

She turned to the kids, who were strangely quiet, sandwiched together on the sofa. 

Mrs. Hawthorne pecked each of them goodbye. 

Kazaria tried to bat her away, but she was ready for him, pulling him into a squeeze. 

From his frantic eyes, he clearly didn’t enjoy it, or the peppering of kisses on his forehead. Melody seemed to share the sentiment, pretending to gag. Stevie stuck his head between his knees, avoiding her attempt at goodbye kisses. 

Their body language was hard to ignore. These children despised their own mother. 

Why? I wondered, the question haunting the back of my mind.

My thoughts snapped back to the photo of her dead son.

Mrs. Hawthorne was undeniably controlling. Maybe the three of them secretly hated her for pushing their older brother to the point of overdose.

“Goodbye, darlings,” their mother murmured, and the kids, like puppets on strings, nodded with wide smiles. “I’ll be back tomorrow morning, all right?”

“Okay, Mommy,” all three chorused.

Melody’s grin faltered slightly, and Kazaria subtly elbowed her, his own widening.

When she had gone, they dropped the act. Melody swiped at her lips, and Kazaria screwed up his face. “Bleurgh!” He stuck out his tongue, wiping his hands on Melody. “She always kisses with wet lips!”

“I avoided her,” Stevie shot him a grin, and his brother shoved him.

“Yeah, because you're her *least* favorite.” 

Melody grabbed a cushion and thwacked him in the face, giggling. Kazaria scowled, hitting her back. “Which is a *good* thing!”

Stevie was hit in the face, and started screaming. 

“You're so annoying,” Kazaria hit him again. “I barely *touched* you!”

Stevie picked up the *TV remote* to bludgeon his brother, and I snatched it off him before I could witness him commit a felony. 

“Stay here,” I told the three of them, and to their credit, they did actually stop hitting each other. I switched on the TV and played Bluey. 

The three of them started trying to kill each other halfway through the first episode. 

And so began my babysitting job from hell. 

After witnessing him unable to sit still for more than a second, I had already mentally diagnosed Kazaria with ADHD.

He could barely focus on the TV, tried to hit Stevie over the head with it. 

His eyes were constantly flitting from one thing to another, and he got angry easily.

Melody thrived on attention, pretending to throw up the tiniest amount of saliva and declare she was sick. 

Stevie was, objectively, the only normal one, though his obsession with trying to murder his brother was concerning. 

While Kazaria was playful with his hits, Stevie was actively trying to hurt him. 

I had to suggest they build a fort so I could child-proof the house after they started fighting. 

Dinner time was challenging. All three refused to eat. Surprise, surprise.

These kids may have been Satan’s offspring, but the food provided was lukewarm chili. 

Nausea curled in my gut, watching it drip from the spoon in a splodgy lump. 

Kazaria said what we were all thinking. “I'm not eating that,” he announced, running into the living room.

Melody immediately turned up her nose at her plate and demanded actual food. 

I tried everything. 

She hated spaghetti, mac and cheese, even pop-tarts, throwing a fit. She followed me around, hands on hips. 

“I want SUSHI,” the little girl demanded. “California rolls, with spicy mayo.” 

She propped herself up on the counter while I was making pancakes for Stevie. 

“Make me sushi.”

The heat from the oven was overbearing. I was sweating, my ears ringing, my cheeks burning. “I can't make that for you, Melody,” I hissed, scanning the cupboards for flour.

“Why not?!”

“Melody—” I slipped on one of her books, almost falling on my ass.

Stevie, from his place at the table, giggled.

“I want California rolls with spicy mayo!” Melody screamed while I ran back and forth between the refrigerator and the cooktop, trying to make Stevie’s pancakes.

She drummed her hands on the cupboards, pushed chairs over, even got Stevie, who was mostly confused, to join in. “WE WANT CALIFORNIA ROLLS!”

Oh, it was *we,* now?

I turned to the scarlet-faced brat, suppressing the deep urge to scream in her face.

“Hey, sweetie,” I crouched in front of her. “We don’t have California rolls.” 

I squeezed her shoulders. “Do you want me to make you something similar?” 

When her expression softened, I knew I had her. “Why don’t I make you vegetarian sushi?”

“Hey, lady!” Kazaria shouted from the living room. “Why don’t you just *order* sushi?”

Melody, now fully supported by her brother, nodded smugly.

I couldn’t resist spitting out, “Thanks, kid!”

I wasn’t expecting his response. “Welcome!”

“California rolls,” Melody held out her hand like I was a wizard who could magically vomit out ready-made sushi. “Now.”

Stevie blinked at me in terror, catapulting pancakes in my face. 

He didn't like Nutella. I tried to *remove* the chocolate, and he collapsed into sobs, saying I ruined them. 

Melody continued her sushi tirade until I threatened her with bedtime. 

Instead, she summoned crocodile tears and accepted veggie rolls, before promptly dumping them in the trash and retiring to the couch. 

Kazaria, meanwhile, was doing who-knows-what in the living room.

By the time 9pm came around, I was mentally exhausted. They weren't sleepy. Of course they were hyper.

I found myself in the kitchen around 10, trying to make myself coffee, when a crash sounded from upstairs. “Kaz!” I was already on a nickname basis with him.

He was going to give me an aneurysm. 

Within two hours, he'd knocked down a bookcase and drew a *very* crude drawing on the wall. When I asked *where* he'd learned it, he threw the pen at me. 

Uh, *middle school*? Idiot,” Kaz mimicked my voice before performing a clumsy cartwheel, headfirst into the stone fireplace. 

Melody squealed, hiding behind her book. Stevie, for reasons unknown, grabbed the remote. 

To my surprise, the hellspawn didn’t erupt into a fit.

Instead, Kaz lay there, his feet still in the air, while my heart was racing.

“Hey, lady,” he mumbled when I helped him sit up. I checked his head for a concussion, but he seemed fine. Kaz blinked up at me, and for the first time, I saw real pain in his eyes. “My brain hurts.”

I wrapped my arms around him, surprised by my own affection. He tried to pull away, squirming, but I held him tighter.

“It’s okay,” I told him. “That’s not your brain that’s hurting.” I playfully bopped him on the head. “That’s your head, Kaz.”

“No, I'm pretty sure it's my brain,” he grumbled. 

I pulled away. “Why don’t you sit down and rest?”

He opened his mouth to respond, glancing at the others.

Stevie and Melody were standing together, wide-eyed.

“Um.” Kaz shifted uncomfortably, his gaze dropping to the floor. “I need to… tell you something.”

“Oh?” I squeezed his shoulder, expecting a mess he was yet to reveal, pre head-smash. “What is it, sweetie?”

“*Kaz*.” Melody’s tone was suddenly terrifyingly cold, just like her mother’s. 

Stevie nodded in silent agreement, shaking his head in one single jerk. 

I noticed the silent communication between them. 

Kaz’s eyes narrowed, scrunching up his nose. 

Stevie glared at him, his lip curling. 

Melody stamped her foot in finality. 

“Alright,” I folded my arms. I figured I'd gained their respect by the way the three of them suddenly looked incredibly guilty. 

“What did you *do*?”

Kaz rolled his eyes, sticking out his tongue at them before turning to me. “Never mind!” he exclaimed, crossing his arms and turning away.

Later, Stevie and Melody were fast asleep on the couch.

They were so cute when they weren't conscious. 

I was hovering over them, trying to think of the best way to scoop them up and take them to bed, when a scream startled me.

Kaz.

Running upstairs and bursting in, I found the boy sitting in a dry tub.

“Kaz!” I grabbed him, yanking him up. 

“Go AWAY!” the boy shrieked, trembling.

Red drops splattering the porcelain tub sent my heartbeat into overdrive.

Dropping down beside him, I searched frantically for cuts, but found nothing.

“Kaz,” my breath came heavy, “where are you bleeding? Can you show me?”

“No!” he whined, lurching toward the toilet. “Just let me…my head hurts,” he whispered, panting, his sharp breaths breaking into sobs. “My brain is too big!”

I sighed, relieved when I found no cuts or bruises. Gently, I pulled him away from the toilet. “Why don’t I put you to bed, hmm?”

I handed him a toothbrush, and he threw it in my face.

“Fuck you,” he grumbled, sticking his pinkie in his ear. “My brain hurts!”

“So does *mine*!” I couldn’t resist snapping back. “It’s called a headache!”

When I helped him stand up, he tumbled out of the bathtub and dived into his mother’s room, slamming the door. 

I tried the handle. Locked. 

“Kaz,” I knocked. I was slowly losing my cool. “Open the door. I just need to make sure you're okay, and then you can have as many tantrums as you want!”

“GO AWAY.”

The voice slammed into me like a wave of ice water.

Adult.

I ran downstairs, but I couldn't remember where my phone was.

I grabbed a knife instead, bounding back up the stairs, and forced the door open. There, on his knees, panting, was a grown man. For a moment, I was paralyzed. 

I opened my mouth to scream his name when the man doubled over, a screech ripping from his lips. “Fuck!” The man sobbed as he doubled over, spitting blood. 

“I can't find it,” he pawed blindly across the floor. “I can't fucking find it!”

He turned to me, blinking wildly, eyes half-focused, blood pouring from his nose. “Please,” he whimpered, his voice collapsing into a gut-churning wail as he jerked violently. “You’ve gotta help me!”

Something came apart inside me when I realized what he meant, a vicious, agonizing dread beginning to take over me. 

I tried taking a shaky step back, but I couldn't move. His skin undulated like a snake, rippling up and down his spine; a fleshy lump of pink slid out of his ear, bleeding down the back of his neck. 

His brain was too *big*. 

The man groaned, burying his head in his arms. 

“My name’s Kaz Hawthorne. I’m twenty-*fucking*-three,” he gasped, coughing up a mouthful of blood onto the carpet before collapsing to his knees. 

“That psycho witch,” he spat, swiping at the pinkish froth on his chin. 

His brain was leaking out of his ears, I thought, dizzily. 

His eyes were wild, desperate, and hauntingly familiar.

Slowly, he staggered to his feet, arms windmilling like a child’s, and I found myself scrambling back, shaking my head. 

“She keeps turning me into a fucking kid, and I can't find my doll—”

He stumbled closer, and the realization sunk in.

The photo. 

“You’re him,” I choked out.

He surprised me with a grin, childlike even when he didn’t mean it to be. “Mommy said we failed, so we needed to start again.” He dropped onto his knees, crawling under the bed. “Where's my doll?”

“Doll?” I whispered. 

Kaz nodded, tearing Mrs Hawthorne’s room apart. “Mom’s dollhouse. We need to find it.”

My brain was already whirring. Start again, I thought.

From birth?

Without thinking, I grabbed a tissue and gagged, wiping pinkish sticky ooze from his face. “Slow down. What do you mean?”

His eyes were scaring me, rolling back and forth, like he was fighting to stay awake.

I winced at the sludge running from his ear. “Your mom… did this to you, because you didn't live up to her expectations?”

He didn’t respond, holding up a phone. My phone.

“I've got your phONneeee.” His voice slurred, and he tipped sideways. “Woah.”

I steadied him. “Stay still.”

Kaz’s eyes were hollow, vacant and wrong  like they didn't belong. “I need to call my fiance and tell her…” He choked on a sob, tapping the screen. “I don’t know! I don’t *know*. I just need to, fuck, I need to see her. She thinks I overdosed on coke, man!”

He grabbed me, just like a kid, his nails digging into my wrists. 

“I'm *twenty three*,” he whispered, as if he was trying to convince not just me, but himself. He finally let go, attempting to dart away. But his body gave up. When the man hit the ground, I grabbed a blanket and threw it over him.

“I can’t move, Sienna,” he whispered. “I need to get out of this house. I can’t breathe. She’s always there, suffocating me. I can’t fucking breathe. I can’t breathe. She's going to fucking kill me—”

“HEY, IDIOT.”

Another voice, another adult voice, startled me.

Twisting around, a looming man with thick blonde hair stood, his eyes narrowed at Kaz. “I told you.""

Stevie.

Acid filled my mouth. 

Mrs. Hawthorne had turned her adult children into babies.

“Fuck off,” Kaz grumbled in response to his brother. “Where's the doll?”

“Hell if I know,” Stevie grumbled. “Probably under lock and key.”

Stevie’s eyes flashed to me. “He needs a doctor,” he said. He helped me pull Kaz to his feet. “Can you get us out of here?”

I bit back a harsher retort. “You're an adult too.”

“Obviously.”

“So, the photographic vocabulary—” he cut me off. 

“Was *bullshit*?” he mimed an explosion. “Shocker.”

The two of us hauled Kaz from his room and halfway down the stairs.

Stevie stayed close to me, his breath in my ear.

“We go straight out the front door,” he whispered. “Do you have a car, Sienna?”

I froze, dazed, Kaz awkwardly sprawled over my shoulders, I remembered. “What about your sister?”

“I’m coming too!” another voice sounded from downstairs.

A small girl appeared, in her early twenties, dressed in jeans and a tee, with the exact same nagging tone of a certain five-year-old.

Melody Hawthorne threw a bundle of clothes at her brothers, rolling her eyes.

“Get dressed,” she instructed. “You two look like unfinished Ken dolls. I told you to wait until tonight!” Her eyes widened when she saw blood smeared down Kaz’s face.

She lunged forward, bursting into tears, her child self bleeding back into her eyes. 

“Is Kaz okay?!”

She helped us carry him downstairs, sobbing the whole time.

“Stay here,” I told the three of them. “I’m just going to get the car, okay?”

When their eyes widened, I hugged each of them.

Fuck. Even as adults, I was undeniably attached to these little brats.

“You can’t just walk out of the house as adults,” I told them. “I’ll give a signal, and one by one, you’ll follow me to my car.”

Melody nodded, though Stevie looked sickly.

“But the evil witch is watching,” Kaz mumbled into my shoulder. “You're not listening to me! We need to find those dolls, and rip off their heads.”

“Stay here,” I reiterated. “Do not move.”

I opened the door slowly and darted down the driveway. The night air was cool, a relief on my flushed skin. I froze, mid-run, when I realized my car was fucking gone. 

I darted back to the house, my stomach lurching. 

Before I could turn around, the Hawthorne door slammed shut.

Fuck.

I turned the handle.

Locked.

“Kids!” I managed to gasp out. “Open the door!”

“Sienna!” Stevie shrieked. “We didn’t lock it!” He paused, his voice collapsing into a sob. “I think Kaz is d… dying.” His cry was an agonizing wail, both child and adult, so unnatural, so monstrous, I lost my breath.

“Stevie,” I hissed. “Stevie, is he breathing?”

“I don't know!” he sobbed. “There’s so much blood! I can’t stop it! Sienna, we need to call an ambuBlance!”

I knocked again, but my fist hit… paper.

The paper door, part of the paper house. 

The Hawthorne siblings' screams dulled to a low murmur. 

I stepped back, my stomach twisting. The Hawthorne home was no longer made of brick and cedar but of pieces of paper, intricately folded and shaped, as if by the hands of an artist. Slowly, the home itself began to collapse, the concrete underneath me bleeding into cardboard. 

I staggered backward, landing on the lawn, on every blade of grass becoming *paper*. 

Scurrying back, the slow stream of *paper*, like a virus, was catching up to me. 

Lifting my head, the Hawthorne home was a single piece of *paper*.

The paper door on the paper house… where the paper dolls lived.

Something sharp pricked the back of my neck.

Like ice-cold water rushing into my bloodstream, my body sagged forward.

My vision blurred. My lips parted, but no sound came out.

“Sienna?!” Melody screamed from somewhere within the paper, the pounding on the paper door echoing, bouncing inside my skull. “Sienna, what’s going on?”

I wanted to answer her.

I wanted to help Kaz, who was dying.

Stevie, who was sobbing. Half adult, half child.

But so tired.

Besides. 

Weren't they just… 

Paper? 
… 

… 

… 

I awoke three times.

The first time I came to,  I was slumped on Mrs. Hawthorne’s shoulder.

The world was swinging left to right.

Left to right.

The second time, I was lying on my back on  concrete, staring at bloody markings, like runes, scratched into the ceiling of a dilapidated room. 

Mrs. Hawthorne’s basement? 

A growing shadow bled over me. Mrs. Hawthorne. In her hands, a frantic ball of fur, held by the neck. Some kind of animal.

I only had to see the knife to know what was going to happen. 

I squeezed my eyes shut, the sharp screech of the animal collapsing into gurgles. 

Warm red droplets hit my cheeks, at first like rain, and I could imagine, for just a moment, that I was with Imogen again. Riding our bikes in the summer rain as it drenched our clothes. 

Kissing her, and deciding she *smelled* like summer rain. 

*Drip*.

*Drip*.

*Drip*.

A raw shriek tore from my throat, agonizing, strong enough to send my body into an arch, when it came fast, boiling hot blood drowning me, scalding my skin. 

Mrs. Hawthorne stepped closer and my vision blurred. 

In her scarlet-slick hands, a tiny paper doll.

It has my eyes, I thought dizzily. 

And my mouth, my lips still parted, still screaming. 

—

The third time, I awoke groggy, to fairy lights. Pretty lights. Blue, aaaaand yellow, and the other color I couldn’t grasp. Weird. 

It felt like I was upside down, my eyes dizzy, my thoughts plastic. I didn’t notice how huge the Hawthorne living room was until I was lying on my back. So many weird corners and edges to the ceiling. 

Bright light filtered through the windows, and I found myself calling it… 

Pretty. 

A knock at the door sent me into a sitting position.

Across the room, young Kaz sat alone, cross-legged and frowning at me. 

His siblings were nowhere to be seen. “It’s all my fault,” he whispered. “I’m so sorry.”

When I tried to speak, he turned away, and I could see the skin of his cheek torn and taped up. Paper. I jumped up, but my legs felt weird. 

I started toward him, but he shook his head. “Don't come near me.”

“Hello!” a voice slammed into my ears, and I followed a long stretch of bleeding light that collapsed into something so bright I had to cover my eyes.

I heard voices whispering in the doorway. A towering figure loomed over me, grinning, a giant man, whose gaze suddenly found me.

“Aww.”

He scooped me into his arms, swinging me around like a fucking toy. 

“Hello, sweetheart!”

He chuckled as a gasp parted my lips. “I’m Sam! I’m going to be your new babysitter.”",9,1754867730.0,ByfelsDisciple,1,0.91,False
1mmx5vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1mmx5vn/so_mad_at_myself_was_doing_well_and_this/,So mad at myself.  Was doing well and this afternoon my blood sugar was 200.,"Granted I couldn’t stop eating popcorn at the movies and it was a large with butter.  It’s crazy how all week I was expecting my blood sugar to be high because I had a few croutons in my salad.  Or a small part of the pita bread with it.  I had a few bites of a cookie and when I would check it wouldn’t be bad.  I would except about 150 and it would be 120.  

Today before I left for the movie it was 107.  I had coffee, turkey bacon, a few crackers and cheese.  Got home about 2.5 hours later after the popcorn (and some broasted chicken after) this time it was 202.  Broasted chicken alone wouldn’t do that so I know it was too much popcorn.  I can eat a small popcorn and it doesn’t go that high so I guess it’s about the amount of carbs.  I am on 5 mg of Mounjaro.  I guess if I want to have a splurge day I need to expect it.  Or I go up on my dose and/or add Jardiance.  Mounjaro and Metformin gave me too many stomach issues.    

I went for a 20 min bike ride and walked the dog for a bit and will check it again in a bit.  ",7,1754867719.0,diabetes_t2,13,0.77,False
1mmx5rw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmx5rw,Today’s haul + my first ever act of kindness (crying😭🤍),"I want to start off by saying.. I cried happy tears like a little baby bitch in stores, I’ve never been gifted an act of kindness in the 15 years I’ve shopped at lush. And today it happened! 

I drove an hour to the furthest location because they have all the goodies and had amazing conversations with the two staff in the store about our favorite scents and perfumes. I really wanted to buy Alina and lust, but it wasn’t in my budget to do so today. On check out, the associate not ringing me up said “a gift from me to you” and slid Alina solid my way. I immediately started crying and was like, “are you for real right now?? I’ve never had this happen!!” Which made the associate ringing me up and the one who gifted me Alina gasp, one said “this is a crime” and they both started grabbing stuff.. (earlier I had mentioned shopping at lush for 15 yrs but never going THIS crazy until this years releases) y’all when I say I was SOBBING.. the girl brought the LUST liquid perfume since that’s what we were talking about for awhile , and the guy turmeric roll, power, and the facial toner. It was very thoughtful of them, I felt SO seen (I said my favorite scent was turmeric latte, hence the power and turmeric roll I think!) I’m absolutely shook over an hour later by this act of kindness and still crying over it. Thank you SO much E & T if you see this post! You made my entire week!!!
 
ANYWHO HERES MY REVIEW BELLOW!! 

Witch bath bomb is sweet with a slight hint of tart to it ! Almost like bubblegum with a tart kick at the end 

Midnight magic bubble bar I truthfully don’t get much of a scent from. Vanilla maybe? I purely bought it because it’s shaped like a mushroom and I’m that kind of gal lol. 

Alien egg farm shower jelly reminds me of zesty! I’m obsessed! It’s got a similar lime candy tartness to it

The comforter shower gel —  I fell in love with black currant because “no way to say goodbye”. I bought the comforter scrub during the sale and fell head over heels, was sad to have bought the last tub of the scrub because I love this scent!! I want to say the gel reminds me more of no way to say goodbye , but I think it’s the black currant taking over !  It’s a nice sweet, but zesty at the end smell. 

Lord of Misrule shower gel was a scent profile I always avoided without even smelling because the pepper. I smelled it for the first time in perfume format a few weeks ago and was STUNNED by the complexity of this scent. It’s not just pepper. It’s so much more complex than that. It’s spicy, earthy, sweet. Just very special! 

Karma body spray, karma can do NO wrong. It smells exactly the same in any shape or form it’s put in!

Strawberry feels forever, I was hoping more from this. Will have to wear on its own later. It’s very subtle, creamy, and has hint of artificial strawberry to it. Kind of reminds me of what a strawberry air freshener would smell like. I’m not 100% if I’ll keep or return! 

Supermilk smells like supermilk primer to me, but more lemon tart than creamy. It’s still true to the smell, just more on the tart side vs milky! 

Lord of Misrule spray smells like the shower gel to me!

Turmeric roll-m doesn’t smell like turmeric latte BUT I do love this cleanser I’ve used it before, reminds me of angels on bare skin, has a soft spicy but playdough smell to it. I like how it leaves my face matte and bright 

Power smells like turmeric latte and I love this conditioner! I use it every few weeks because it’s heavy in protein , love how it makes my hair look

Lust was a perfume my Reddit bestie suggested and I fell in LOVE last time I went to buy cardamom coffee I was torn to get LUST and LOM instead but decided not too. This time I stood by the same perfume wall contemplating buying it but decided not too since I got so many body sprays.. so the fact I have it now I’m stunned! It’s a very sexy floral smell. Not grandma floral,  the jasmine shines through! 

Alina upon first application the smell is very odd.m like dove soap. But the dry down.. reminds me of old songs are walking!! 😍 I definitely will have to get the liquid bottle eventually!

this morning i woke up with a little voice in my head telling me to do a pregnancy test. I've always had a strong intuition.

So got up, had my coffee and tried to be like nah stop it, you on birth control.

Whent for a walk with the dog and walked by our little local grocery store in our tiny town and that voice came up again, so I went inside and bought 2 packages. Lol.. whent home and took one, it was positive,  no doubt, line came up right away.
By my calculations im only 3+3 , I had a heavy period last cycle, so I know im not that far along. 

Took a new one 4 hours later, same result, not even a faint line. No no, its very clear

I have no idea how to react. I already have 4 kids, youngest turns 5 today. 
I know im not gonna terminate, I dont have the heart, nether does my husband. But im also not overjoyed of happiness right now. I did not expect to start over in my 30s. Youngest one finally starting school next year and we are gonna start all over again..with late nights, crying, nursing and so on.  I had just started to get my own hobbies etc back on track without having to worry about diapers and feedings and pooh

1mmx0w7,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1mmx0w7/i_had_a_date_with_my_lo/,"I had a ""date"" with my LO","Hello I am new to this community but I have realized my limerence decades ago. It is the first time I wanted to address it. 

Backstory: my LO and I are college classmates. We had an instant connection about struggling with our mental health and other shared hobbies. We clicked, and I was in a messy relationship during that time. He has his own LO. I ended up marrying my toxic boyfriend, he ended up dating his LO. Life continued and we became close friends even after university. He was the sympathetic ear and a good person to get advice from. He's really intelligent emotionally and academically.

Our emotional connection is the one that has haunted me. We never dated, we never explicitly said attraction for each other. However due to our closeness, our friends would often tease that we are this close to becoming a couple. And that idea probably gave me an escape. Our chats and interactions were pretty nice. It felt good as compared to my marriage. I began thinking of him as my what if. What if I dated him instead? What if I broke up with my boyfriend (now husband) and have told him I liked him? This continued for years, and here we are! 16 years of limerence. 

We finally had that chance to go out of the group setting, away from our close-knit college friend group. I became very agressive in connecting with him recently as my marriage was falling apart. I noticed myself talking to him more. He is so good at engaging with me, between group chats that we would dominate and our private messages that contain a lot of witty banter, shared inside jokes, and so on. Those kinda gave me a great high. And when we had the chance to see this movie, I grabbed it.

He finally shared what happened to his failed relationship with his LO. He was able to tell me about his next lingering relationship. How he was still friends with his exes, how he has this female friend that he gives advice to. 

Then that cracked the rose-tinted glasses. He is a rescuer kind of guy. He has friends that seem like his ""projects"" and I was one of them. What a realization. 

The night continued and we moved on from the dinner, movie, and coffee to a bar where we drank and talked a bit longer. I enjoyed the company. As the night grew deeper, I realized the friendship we had was just it. And yeah, I was someone he can help. He wanted to become a psychiatrist. He wanted to help solve people's romantic relationships. Looks like I was one of his firsts. Then came one of her exes. And surprisingly, they're still close. He is still her confidant. That actually helped me start working on this feeling.

I told him, I bet you'd date her again. He said no, he's still focusing on his PhD and I felt some weird limerent hope there but I have to kill it.

Today, I decided to keep our interactions only within the group. I have started a no-initiation plan, I will stop the dms among others. Next week we'll see each other again but I promise to behave and I hope to have progress.",2,1754867332.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

1mmwzwc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mmwzwc,FS Anguilla - a review,"TLDR: amazing stay, amazing food, breathtaking views. I actually never want to leave. Thank you @sarahwlee for not only suggesting this to celebrate my 40th birthday but for also making sure we were so well taken care of throughout our stay 

All right so this will be a long but I hope thorough review. About a year ago I started to process of figuring what I wanted to do for my 40th birthday and where I wanted to go. The criteria was a villa that could accommodate 8, 4-5 hours from the east coast, great beaches and great food. From the group I heard a lot of great things about @sarahwlee so I reached out to her recommendation and her first response was FS Anguilla. After some research I knew this would be the spot for our trip. 

Pre-Arrival: 10/10

The concierge and then later the concierge team were amazing. They responded quickly to all of my inquiries. They did all of our dinner reservations for us and handled the credit card forms. I booked our mokes through them. I was also able to send ahead some gifts for my guests that they arranged and set up in the villa for my guests to find upon our arrival. I booked into the 4 bedroom ocean view villa and took advantage of a book 5 nights pay 4 promotion that was going on at the time. At the time of booking we were guaranteed an upgrade to the 4 bedroom oceanfront villa.

Arrival 9.5/10

Since there were 8 of us I opted for the private transfer through Funtime cruises (booked through the residences staff). This was perfect. They sent a van to pick us up at the airport to drive across the parking lot and handled all of our luggage. We had a great and leisurely 25 minute boat ride to the Anguilla ferry terminal. The entrance and departure taxes were handled by the resort so upon arrival we only had to present our passports and away we went. At the airport we were picked up by Jethro who was our personal driver for the remainder of our stay in Anguilla. Once we arrived to the resort we were driven directly to Villa 2. Imagine our surprise when we were greeted with a 2 category further upgrade to the 5 bedroom beachfront villa. The villa was STUNNING. From the moment we walked in, the view from the front door just took my breath away. The 5 bedroom comes with 2 golf carts and is on a row by itself. There is a 6 bedroom under construction down the road but we never heard any noise from construction. We also had a residential assistant (Kimara) who was amazing. We texted throughout the stay and anything we needed she was there. When two of our friends forgot to book their ferry tickets ahead of time for a daytime excursion, she called the ferry company and arranged for round trip tickets to be scheduled for them. She made the trip so incredibly stress free and was able to problem solve anything we needed. The only thing I would suggest is a tour of the property on that first day. But the resort is fairly easy to navigate and we were able to find our way around. Whenever we were lost people were so helpful in assisting us!

Villa: 9.5*/10

I could live here permanently. This was a beautiful space and a great place for a group!! There are 2 bedroom downstairs - 1 with a king bed and the other with 2 queen beds. Upstairs you have the both the junior master and master suites. The master suite has an amazing walk in closet. Both suites have balconies with swing beds. They also have outdoor showers which were heavenly. The showers had great water pressure and the outdoor showers really got hot. The only annoyance was there were no hooks anywhere to hang the robes or towels in the bathroom. Leaving from the kitchen there is a laundry room with full size washer and dryer for your use and then a detached room with its own entrance with a king beds and adjoining bathroom. The outdoor space is next level. A gorgeous infinity pool with hottub. There are lounge chairs set up along with a sitting area and then outdoor dining/kitchen area. From here it is a short path down to Barnes Bay. They have 4 outdoor loungers set up halfway down the path and then another 4 loungers set down by the beach. You can easily walk along the beach to Half Shell Beach Shack. 

Service 9/10

This was where everyone truly shined. I have never been someplace where I felt as truly cared for. The people of Anguilla are so incredibly kind and genuine. Every member of my party felt like they could be themselves and we talked throughout the week about how wonderful everyone was. From Kimara, to the women who cleaned the villa every day. We had a dedicated person for the day and then another person who did our turndown every night. We were always greeted by a warm smile and people seemed eager to help. The women at Aleta would remember us each day for breakfast and had the same table set for us every morning. The only negative was the length of time to get food anywhere. Pool service was slow and room service took a minimum of one hour to arrive no matter what time of day we ordered. This may be a function of island time or the fact that Salt is currently closed for renovations so I think the kitchen they were using is further away  

Food: I’ll do this in 2 sections 

On resort 10/10

We had breakfast at Bamboo (a la carte) and Aleta (buffet). Due to booking with Sarah we received $75 pp for breakfast. This did not include gratuity or alcohol. The food at both places was fantastic. At Aleta they also had complimentary make your own mimosa which we throughly enjoyed. 

One of my friends did eat at Sunset lounge and she loved her sushi roll but felt her drink wasn’t great. 

The coffee shop is super cute and they do a great job with the different coffee drinks. If you like cold brew try the Salty

Bamboo - since Salt is closed they are serving the salt menu at Bamboo. We were in Anguilla for the second week of Carnival and they had features chefs and had a special menu for these 2 weeks. This was an amazing place to close out our trip and the food was next level. One of my favorite meals of the trip. The lobster tails were great as was the lamb chops and the ceviche. 

Off resort: 8/10

From scouring this group we tried a number of places: 

Blanchard beach shack - live the burgers. Consensus shrimp tacos were great but very small. Fries great 

Tastys POV - the sangria will get you but it is so good. Lobster pasta and seafood salad were great. Conch fritter was amazing. Loved the lobster bisque. 

Veya- this was such a cute spot. Drinks were really good. Really enjoyed the food. This is where I did my birthday dinner. I reached out to milestone events who is an event planner on the island who came before our arrival and set up our table. She arranged for a aphotographer there as well as a cake from a local bakery. 

Sharkys: great Calamari. Really enjoyed the lobster cake. Top 5 risotto I’ve ever had. 

Straw Hat. Love the setting right on meads bay. We got our wires crossed and came an hour late to our reservation. Even though their closing time was only 30 minutes after we got there, they still sat us and gave great service. 

Gym 10/10

Great space. They have indoor and outdoor lifting spaces, a cardio room and a spin room. Loaded up with towels and the boxes FS water. I usually workout on vacation and wanted for nothing. They have the really nice life fitness cardio equipment, 2 concept rowers a great variety of dumbbells and kettle bells and several machines. 

Spa: 10/10

So just to warn you there are no saunas, cold lounges, hot tubs. The steam room was under construction. But the outdoor lounging area is one of the best I’ve utilized. This is the best view on the resort. They have their own pool which is also infinity and a swing bed under a pavilion so you’re always shaded. I could have stayed there all day. I did the Anguilla salt scrub and the 80 minute deep sea massage. I would highly recommend both services and after all the work my therapist did I feel like a new person. There is no “good” at the spa, but you can go get it and bring it back!

Amenities:

We booked all of our excursions (except the moke rental) outside of FS. So I can’t speak to most of the amenities. The adult pool is great and every day at 4 pm one of the workers gets in the pool with a floating bar and serving prosecco! 

The bath products are fantastic!

I would do this trip again and again and Anguilla will always have a special place in my heart. ",21,1754867255.0,FATTravel,7,0.85,False
