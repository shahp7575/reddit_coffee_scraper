Alright this post is going to be hefty. 

First and foremost I have strong paranoia. Once, as a teenager, I had a minor pain in my testicle and did research and then it became unbearable to walk. Went to doc and got a scan and told it was a cyst. I‚Äôm in early 30s and this was 8 or 9 years back. Also as a teen I smoked pot and everything was dandy until a huge pothead told me he laced the weed. Heart rate was 160 all night. Apparently it was good sh*t but have been afraid to smoke since. 

Anyhow, last year I began to have strep throat that lasted months. Would spit and see light red blood in every spit (too fearful to check but I do see blood when I brush).

Moved in with a family member and a few hours into my ride with them they began experiencing headaches. 

It‚Äôs over a year and the entire family constantly gets sick. 

In fact there‚Äôs many times I‚Äôve gotten close to someone and they feel headache and strong flu like symptoms (I‚Äôm assuming) in less than an hour being with them. 

Currently having constant throat clearing and minor headache. Family I live with also sounds like they have that.

What disease could I possibly have that would infect others that quick?

Also I‚Äôve been abstinent all my life. Only some months back did I experiment sexually. 

An even longer story is that I at my new job last December I would have constant stomach bugs. I believe an evil coworker was putting something in the coffee creamer. Another worker came up to me and said she was trying to poison him. Then I pieced the puzzle together. She quit that same week he said this to me. 

Yes I‚Äôm paranoid and an over thinker. However I‚Äôm very logical. What is wrong ? ",1,1736908656.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt know how else to start this other than jumping in - I am completely and utterly finished with sales. I can‚Äôt do it anymore. I am currently working in what some consider a cushy job, and I just can‚Äôt deal with it anymore. I do account management currently in the hospitality sector, I sell towels and stuff to hotels. Basically every single thing including the art on the walls, coffee in the lobby, and the spigot in the bath. Need to have items, I work in the biggest company for this in the sector, and no prospecting.

I‚Äôm good at my job. I grew my 3.1 million dollar portfolio last year into a 4.6 million dollar portfolio this year. I have the most strategic portfolio in this sector at this company for this brand. I make like 40 phone calls and emails per day combined. However‚Ä¶ I just cannot take the constant corporate bullshit any longer. Checking in with deals on a weekly basis that take months (or even years) to close, constant micro-managing in ways that I was *assured* this company *totally hates,* and now, we‚Äôre suddenly going back into office. 

But more than that, I have been in sales for nearly two decades. I‚Äôve been a BDR, SDR, AE, ISR, AM, I‚Äôve been in car sales, phone sales, insurance sales, construction sales, home improvement sales, food sales, advertising sales, I‚Äôve worked in the government sector, apartment housing sector, healthcare supplies sector, and now hospitality sector. I‚Äôve been a sales manager in multiple industries, I‚Äôve done cold calling, door to door, ‚Äúeat your kill‚Äù and everything else. 

I know everyone says this, but I was always great. If not number 1, I was number 2. I feel now that I would rather drag myself pants-less, taint first through a field of broken glass than to schmooze up to the next big kahuna for even one more millisecond to get my commission. I‚Äôm over the big trips and massive hotels and just the general atmosphere of it all. I‚Äôm done. I seriously cannot motivate myself to do this anymore. 

Problem is, I have a family. They rely on my income. I really don‚Äôt think I can do this anymore. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have taken all my time off that I just renewed in January because I went on Christmas vacation and just couldn‚Äôt come back. I don‚Äôt have a degree. I don‚Äôt know what to do.

1i1ninw,https://v.redd.it/f6hnaip0l2de1,Made it out of Florida...,"Everyone's writing stories now so I'm gonna try too  

1/11: Gainesville, Florida. Need to get to Jacksonville to catch a train. Don't like to hitchhike, so going to take the county shuttle bus. Find a camp by the bus stop, ask if I can stay the night. These guys are cool! Give em some spare socks and gloves, they give me a couple smokes. One guy's telling stories about how we kicked the Nazis asses during WWII. They got a garbage bag of Christmas candy that the dollar tree threw out. Good times.  

1/12: Wake up, bird shits on my blanket, another one shits on my hand. Preferable to rain. Clean up, talk with the folks at camp. One guy is off to fly a sign, one guy's off to the food bank. Make myself scarce and go to the bus stop. Bus shows up at 3:30pm. It's free, too.  

Arrive in Palatka, Florida that evening. Run to Dollar General to resupply. Go back to the bus stop. No security, no cameras, no foot traffic... decide to sleep here. See some folks walking into the trees. Consider looking for camp, but they're talking to themselves. Don't want to deal with tweakers. Fall asleep late.  

1/13: Wake up to my alarm at 5:30am, bus comes in 30 minutes. Barely got any sleep. Wait for the bus. Hop on the bus. Dropped at Jacksonville! Look at maps to find a hopout. Get on a bus to the yards. Halfway through the ride, it starts pissing down rain. Phone says it's gonna be raining til 9pm. Fuck.  

10:00am. Go to McDonalds. Get a coffee and plug in my phone charger. Am I gonna have to stay here for 10 hours? Christian rock is playing in the store. Time to settle in...  

12:00pm. Guy walks in. Got a small backpack and a sleeping bag. Asks me where I'm from. Tell him I'm trying to get to Atlanta. He is too! Says he's hopped out of Jacksonville six times. Ask to come along with him, he agrees.  

Now we're both sitting in McDonalds. Forecast says rain ends at 10pm. Now it says 7pm. Now it says 5:30pm? Me and him get to talking. He's been riding for 10 years. Old-school kind of hobo. I like him. I'm young but I ain't no oogle.  

5:00pm. Rain lets up, phones are charged, we hit the road. Fifteen minutes into walking and it starts pissing rain again. Hide under an awning by a funeral home. We get to talking again. Sharing stories. He drinks a lot. He's stunned I don't drink or do drugs. That's the usual reaction...  

7:00pm. Rain lets up, for real this time. Get to walking. Get under a bridge. Miss a ride. Get on the next one. Gettin' cozy under a pig. Then the train starts moving.  

Whole time I'm thinking, ""this guy seems trustworthy, but what's the catch?"" We start talking about Atlanta. He says it's a bad, bad city. I ask why. What he said doesn't need to be repeated... but he had a lot of things to say about black folks and used very colorful language in doing so.  

Okay, this guy's racist. Racist as fuck. Think about throwing him off the train. Decide to stop thinking like an oogle. Now he's arguing with his old lady on the phone, screaming and shouting. At least this is a quick ride?  

1/14: It wasn't a quick ride. Went for 14 hours, sided out quite a few times. Guy's sending voice messages to his girl the whole time. Always yelling. At least he likes me...  

Arrive in Atlanta. We go to the corner store, buy our respective drinks. He wants to be buddies, I really don't... He's gotta start walking south. I gotta start walking north. We finally part ways.  

Walk three miles to the Amtrak station. Got a bus ticket to NOLA tomorrow morning. Only $28! That's a fucking steal. Station is open for a couple more hours. I can charge my phone before setting up camp.  

I don't know the moral of this story, but I sure am glad to be moving again :)

A couple days ago, I got into a really big fight with my parents that lead into my mom saying that I just ‚Äúclock in and out‚Äù and how I‚Äôm basically not doing my job. Keep in mind, I open the front basically everyday and she doesn‚Äôt visit the restaurant everyday to see the work I‚Äôm doing.

Additionally, she was going to get upset at my dad, but my dad shifted the entire blame onto me so he doesn‚Äôt hear it from my mom (for background, I tried reaching out to my dad about instructions for using a new coffee maker and he never responded to my calls or texts. Moments later my parents came in and my mom said I always need to make the coffee first. Told her I texted my dad for instructions and she was about to get upset at him, then my dad proceeded to say that I should‚Äôve known depite it being a brand new coffee machine) Both of my parents continued to verbally degrade my work and yell at me for not doing my job correctly even though I ASKED for instructions. All of this rooted from me asking how to do my job correctly to operate a stupid coffee machine

After the argument, I frustratedly cried in the bathroom and tried pushing through work. My girlfriend visited me to be there for me emotionally, and before she left, my mom told her that I need to toughen up if I wanted to take care of the business and that was my last straw. Since I was a kid, my parents have always suppressed my emotions and told me to get over things, so as an adult, I barely even express emotions out of fear. I hate to cry around my parents because this is the reaction I normally get, is to ‚Äútoughen up ‚Äú and to stop being soft. It‚Äôs a disrespect to me, my masculinity, and my line of work and I‚Äôm so sick of this. I feel undervalued and underappreciated for my work. I haven‚Äôt gotten a good job or thank you since the grand opening

Trying to resolve conflict with them is even worse. My mom hates when I‚Äôm emotional so if I try communicating, it ends up as an argument no matter how I approach her, same thing with my dad. I feel trapped in my emotions. 

I think I‚Äôm just so emotional about this because I feel so underappreciated by both of my parents and it‚Äôs been like that since a child. I‚Äôve sacrificed a lot for this establishment, so for both of them to disrespect my masculinity and emotions really drew the line",2,1736908334.0,GuyCry,2,1.0,False

1i1ncde,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1ncde,Aerobic Septic System Recommendations ,"Here are my personal thoughts on what a new owner should know when moving into a house with an aerobic system. 

First my background, I have grown up in the industry and have been working for about 13 years full time doing maintenance and repairs on aerobic systems in Texas. I work on Jet, Aqua Aire, Aqua Safe, Nuwater, Clearstream, Biomicrobic, FujiClean, Hoot and a couple of other brands. They all have their pros and cons but my preference is the Jet and FujiClean systems due to some design elements that seem to work well on residential systems.

When I talk to a new customer I try to explain that the 2 most important things they need to do is limit the hydraulic and organic overloading. So spread out your water usage and don't use the garbage disposal. 

We ask homeowners to not do more than 3 load of laundry in a 24 hour period and to not shower while the washing machine is running. It is also best not to take more than 1 shower at a time or drain a huge jacuzzi tub all at once. The main thing to keep in mind with hydraulic overloading is that the septic is a maze that is designed to accumulate solids in the early chambers so that the last chamber stays cleaner longer and the system needs to be pumped out less frequently, saving you money and headache. 

When it comes to organic overloading, I tell customers that the bacteria likes to have its food in its simplest form and your body does a wonderful job at that. Your garbage disposal shouldn't be used except for the small stuff that doesn't scrape off into the trash can. Greases fats and oils should never go into a system because the take a lot of oxygen to break down and will overload the bacteria causing the system to smell and have poor treatment. 

Septic systems should be pumped every 2-5 years depending on your usage but I've seen a customer require a pump out twice a year because they don't want to change their lifestyle and the same brand could go 7-8 years without needing it for a family that follows the recommendations very closely. We don't pump out systems and I don't get a kickback from pump companies that I refer out to, we try to give at least 3 referrals for pumping so the homeowner can choose who they use. When I tell someone to get the system pumped it's because that is what is needed.

Of course there are tons of products that can kill the bacteria so you want to keep them out of the system. Some that come to mind are:
-Drain clearing chemicals 
-Medicine and antibiotics 
-Pesticides
-Paints
-Household chemicals 
-Antibacterial soap
-Bleach
-Citrus products 
-Wated softener discharge 
-Liquid fabric softener 

Things that I fish out of systems that don't break down and clog up pumps should also not go into the system. 
-Female hygiene products 
-Cigarette butts
-Disposable diapers 
-Any wet wipe (even the ""flushable"" ones)
-Rags 
-Paper towels 
-Bandages
-Gloves
-Procreatives (please quit flushing your condoms)

Monthly additives are a waste of money for 90% of customers because your gut has all the bacteria your septic needs. 

Talk to your maintenance tech and learn about your system. At least know where the mute switch is on your control panel and it doesn't hurt to build a good relationship with the company that does your scheduled maintenance. I believe an educated customer is our best customer and can typically help us diagnose over the phone to ease your mind before we can get a tech out to do full diagnostics. You should know where your control panel, tanks, and drain field are located on your property and know that you can't build or bark over that area. Please don't plant trees around them either because it's only a matter of time before roots find their way into the tank and cause backups eventually. ",1,1736908060.0,septictanks,0,1.0,False

TL;DR: Newly diagnosed, having multiple anaphylactic flares a day, doctor won't help.

So I was diagnosed with MCAS by an allergist two months ago because I started having anaphylactic reactions to coffee, which I typically drank several of every day. Cutting coffee out stopped that for a while.

Cut to last Tuesday, when I started having several anaphylactic reactions a day. Full body mottled skin/hives, swollen face and neck, tongue swelling up, throat getting scratchy. Taking a dose of two Benadryl seems to keep it at bay for a while. I figured out on Friday that I was reacting to caffeine, so I cut out all caffeine immediately. But it flares up so many times a day that by the end of the day, I've usually had to take 8 Benadryl.

When I called my allergist, who is consistently spectacularly useless, she said ""I wish there was something I could tell you to help, but you should go see a \*dermatologist\*."" Then she said that she was sure it wasn't something that I was eating, like I had told her that I suspected, because ""that doesn't really happen."" When I reminded her that I had developed the allergy to coffee, she said that that ""wasn't really something that happens"" and ""like I said, you need to see a dermatologist."" Which isn't really going to help a systemic issue now is it.

Meanwhile, I don't know if it's just because my bucket is overflowing, but I'm having multiple flares a day, every day, and I have no medical professional helping me, so I'm just winging it. I'm reacting to every liquid I drink that's not water, and then I reacted to chocolate just now, which I suppose makes sense because it has a small amount of caffeine?

I'm not asking for medical advice over the internet, but I feel like I'm drowning here and it's getting exhausting and scary. Any words of advice? Any resources that would help someone newly diagnosed? I'm desperate, so anything helps. Thank you! I appreciate you reading this <3

ETA: I don't think I understand the bucket. Can someone explain it to me? Once it gets full and starts pouring over... what happens then? Do I need to do something to get it back to normal? ty",1,1736908053.0,MCAS,2,1.0,False

Sometimes I can wrench it off

while I eat breakfast.

It tails me too closely across town,

tracking me down

in every shop queue

to hang around my neck

breathing heavily

and jerking off to itself

in the reflection of my computer screen

as I try to look busy

when all of the important tasks are finished.

halfway through.

It whispers nasty comments

about their teeth

how they could afford to lose 20 pounds

and do they know how shrill

their laughter is?

I look at my phone,

and it cowers pitifully next to me, shrinking.

When I pack my things to go home,

it disappears suddenly.

I hit the gas and check my rearview mirror,

I see it closing in behind me.

it shouts at me over my favorite song

that I have listened to that song

a few too many times and‚Äì

it is right in my ear‚Äì

shouldn't you be a little more interesting by now?

\-

When I sit down to eat dinner,

it points out how my boyfriend

chews too loudly

leaves the lights on

says the wrong words.

I find myself less in love with him

when it gnaws on my calf beneath the table

with the tenacity of a dog

that has been starving for weeks.

\-

As I lie down to sleep,

Boredom, its belly bulging,

creeps out of my room and into my kitchen,

spoiling my forgotten week-old grapes

with its lecherous touch

and it crawls back to whatever hole it sleeps in at night.

So then you have the ""Studies"" section where the ""real"" scientists work.  Half them are just average people with crappy masters degrees from low tier universities that have been working at USGS for 20 years to become managers.

There are a few very high quality experts in the USGS, but most are average. Those are usually highly published and recognized.  The managers are mediocre (those that can't science, manage)

The current manager at my last office was extremely Christian... Oxymoron much? 

...

And there's NO avenue to move up from technician to hydrologist.  They act like you need to be so smart to work in the studies, and the skills your learn as a technician don't apply whatsoever to bring a hydrologist. Positions are so rare and they hand pick for the position.

Fuck it, I left and got a Geologist job with Corps of Engineers.

I am visiting Charlotte for the first time this weekend--I love black coffee (and Americano), and plan to visit Enderly Coffee Co., Night\* Swim, and HEX. Since there are multiple locations for Nightly Swim...which one do you recommend for a visitor? I am sure all locations have their own characters, but was just wondering what you (those who live in Charlotte, or anyone who has visited before) like the best. If this helps, I usually like to look around different neighborhoods, go to local events, and...just [zone out](https://www.inc.com/jessica-stillman/zoning-out-is-good-for-you.html) imagining I am one of the locals üòÇ (My partner and I are in our mid 30s if you think this matters).

Also a dumb question (please laugh, it's OK): I come from a warmer place...and sometimes I realize that indoors can get pretty hot when I visit cities where winters are colder than where I am from. How's the temperature gap between indoor and outdoor? Trying to figure out how to dress for the weather that is very different from where I live. I know this sounds so dumb, but I have to ask because I had an experience where wearing a thick sweater was a terrible idea in another place I visited when winter was freezing. It was like 90F inside and 25 outside. I know Charlotte has a way warmer weather than that but still wanted to ask.

Thank you!

1i1n8bs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1i1n8bs/i_hate_keeping_how_our_relationship_started_a/,I hate keeping how our relationship started a secret,"I saw my (24F) fiance (28M) for the first time when I was 21 and he was 25 at a cafe while I was with some of my friends and he was by himself. I‚Äôve always been really shy so walking up to him and just starting a conversation was never really an option for me but I needed to meet him. I ended up just reading his first name off his coffee cup as I walked by and searched up his name with the city we live in and ended up finding his picture on his linkedin profile. From there, I got his full name and eventually found his other social media. He had a main account as well as a smaller account that only his close friends followed but it was a public account and he posted pretty much everything from pictures with friends to videos of him in the gym or on a boxing bag to his pictures of his bartending side job and pictures of places he visited and more. 

I decided it would be easiest for me to meet him at the gym he went to as I could ask him to spot me and go from there. At the cafe, I had also noticed he wore a specific religious bracelet (I‚Äôm of the same faith) and it‚Äôs pretty common to go to the place of worship on Sunday mornings/afternoons so I thought it would be a nice coincidence if he saw me at both the gym and the place of worship. From the videos he had posted of him in the gym, I figured out what gym he went to and got a membership and started showing up in the evenings around the time I assumed he would be getting off work and I figured out his gym schedule within a few days. 

One day, there was an empty bench press beside him and I asked him to spot me and had purposefully put a bit too much weight on the bar so he‚Äôd actually have to help me. As expected, I couldn‚Äôt lift it and he lifted the weight off me and asked if I was okay and went back to his workout. That week, I noticed him at our place of worship but I was with my family so we only made eye contact but it was clear he recognized me. The next day at the gym, I went over to use the squat rack beside him and we ended up talking for a few minutes and he asked for my number. We texted for a few days till he asked me on a coffee date. Things progressed naturally after that and he took me on more dates and we hung out alone many times and I quickly realized he was everything and more I had imagined him to be when I saw him at the cafe. Once I confessed my feelings, he asked me to be his girlfriend and we‚Äôve been together ever since.

Early on, I had peaked at his phone while he was putting in his passcode one time and I would look through his phone when I could and find conversations with his exs and the girls he had casually been seeing before me to figure out what he liked and disliked, why they broke up, outfits he found pretty, basic fun facts about him like his favorite foods and movies. I didn‚Äôt really change anything about myself other than getting better at cooking a few things he really liked and buying some more cute outfits. Since then, I moved in with him after I graduated, we got engaged a year after, and we‚Äôre getting married soon and I‚Äôm pregnant with our first. I‚Äôve fallen so much more for him during this time. He‚Äôs honestly everything I could possibly want - he‚Äôs obviously handsome but also smart, successful, loving, and romantic and I‚Äôve always felt loved and safe with him. 

I‚Äôm the only person who knows that us meeting at the gym wasn‚Äôt a random coincidence and the dramatic moment of him saving me from being crushed under the bar was something I had planned. I don‚Äôt regret anything I did but it‚Äôs also super hard to keep this in and I really want to tell someone. I know it was morally wrong but I rationalized it with the fact that I wasn‚Äôt hurting anyone. I would love to tell my fiance and I think he will probably find it a little cute but I don‚Äôt want him to feel like he can‚Äôt trust me.

1i1n6kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sidehustle/comments/1i1n6kn/turning_failed_amazon_returns_into_5kmo/,Turning Failed Amazon Returns into $5k/mo,"Ever scrolled through your order history and realized you never returned that weird kitchen gadget you swore you‚Äôd send back? You‚Äôre not alone. Millions of people sit on Amazon returns past the refund window, crossing their fingers it‚Äôll magically handle itself. That‚Äôs where you come in with a brand-new side hustle.

The beauty of this hustle? Your customers give you their unwanted stuff for free. When you sell it, you keep 20-30% of the profits and send them the rest. They win by getting money they‚Äôd otherwise kiss goodbye, and you win by flipping their lost returns into sweet side-hustle income. Let‚Äôs talk about turning this little operation into a $5k/month moneymaker.

**The MVP (Getting your first customer)**

Find Your First Batch of Items:

* Start with your own stuff lying around the house. Get used to selling stuff online (if you haven‚Äôt already).

Sell friends and family items:

* Post on your personal social media explaining how you‚Äôll take their ‚Äúforgot-to-return Amazon purchases,‚Äù sell them, and split the profits.
* They hand over random items for free‚Äîeverything from clothing to electronics‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre already out the money.
* You‚Äôll handle listing, shipping, and dealing with buyers.

Establish Your Profit Split:

* Charge 20-30% of the sale price for your service. Keep it simple and transparent: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take your item, list it for you, and you get 70-80% of whatever it sells for.‚Äù

List Items on Multiple Platforms

* eBay, OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, Poshmark: Cast a wide net.
* Make sure to shoot decent photos and write clear, honest descriptions.

**Numbers Breakdown (First Batch)**

Suppose you pick up 5 items worth about $50 each in resale value.

You sell them for $250 total.

You keep 25% = $62.50.

Your friend/family member gets $187.50 for what was basically junk in their closet.

Now you‚Äôve got cash in hand, social proof, and you‚Äôre off to the races.

**Getting Your Next 100 Customers**

Ready to go bigger? The good news is people everywhere have random Amazon items collecting dust. Let‚Äôs tap into that gold mine.

1. Social Media Blitz:
   * Create a Facebook Business Page or Instagram account called something like ‚ÄúAmazon Return Rescue‚Äù or ‚ÄúForgot-to-Return.‚Äù
   * Post photos of items you‚Äôve sold, before-and-after stories, and testimonials from happy folks who got money back.
   * Encourage shares, likes, and comments to reach more potential customers.
2. Referral Program
   * Offer your existing clients (friends, family, early customers) a 10% bonus on their next item if they refer someone who has at least one item to sell.
   * Word-of-mouth is powerful here‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs got that buddy who forgot to return a cat hammock or electronic doodad.
3. Local Ads & Community Boards
   * Put up flyers at community centers, coffee shops, or anywhere with a bulletin board.
   * Pitch it as a hassle-free way to make money back on items that are otherwise collecting dust.
   * Emphasize your ‚Äúno risk‚Äù model: If it doesn‚Äôt sell, they haven‚Äôt lost anything (they were going to toss or donate it anyway).
4. Small Business Collabs
   * Some local businesses end up with overstock, returns, or open-box items from Amazon vendor programs. Offer to handle their liquidation for a cut.
   * They free up space and time, you earn a steady supply of resellable goods.

**Numbers Breakdown (Next 100 Customers)**

* Now you‚Äôre handling about 25 items per week, average resale value of $40. That‚Äôs $1,000 gross weekly.
* At 25% commission, you pocket $250 a week = $1,000 a month.
* As your reach grows, so will the volume. The more items you flip, the bigger that pot gets.

**Building to $5,000 Per Month in Profit**

Let‚Äôs ramp this up to a legit operation that nets you $5k in profit monthly. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Hire or Partner Up**
   1. Sorting, photographing, listing, shipping‚Äîit all takes time. Once you‚Äôre handling 50+ items a week, consider bringing on a part-time helper or partner.
2. **Streamline Your Listing Process**
   1. Use inventory management tools like Vendoo, List Perfectly, or eBay‚Äôs bulk listing feature to post items across multiple platforms at once.
3. Niche Down
   1. Certain categories move faster and fetch better prices‚Äîelectronics, brand-new apparel, baby gear, small kitchen appliances, etc.
   2. If you see a trend (e.g., people forgetting to return cookware or smart home devices), become the go-to reseller for that niche.
4. Offer Premium Services
   1. Expand to a house-call service: You‚Äôll come pick up their items, take them away, and handle everything. Charge an extra fee or slightly higher commission for that convenience.
5. Bulk Deals with Repeat Clients
   1. Partner with local real estate agents or apartment complexes. When people move, they often purge items they never returned.
   2. Offer them a special rate if they send multiple items your way, or a flat commission for a large lot.

**Big Picture Math:**

1. 50 items per week at $40 average resale = $2,000 gross each week.
2. At a 25% take, that‚Äôs $500 a week = $2,000/month.
3. Scale to 100 items weekly = $4,000/month. Add premium services or higher-value items, and you‚Äôre knocking on that $5k door.

Could even be something quirky, such as bringing them to Don Donki, as that's definitely going to be a shock to their senses.

Same for eating experiences, just looking for things they've likely never encountered in the U.S. 

  
Any unusual food/dishes/cafes/restaurants that you could recommend? I currently have:

Sarawak Laksa: (Homemade, we have a killer, never fails recipe, so this is already taken care of)

Tokyo Restaurant: 6th Ave burnt cheesecake  (A must-try, I know they'll love this, sweet tooth) 

Bamboo Hills: (Several good options, and beautiful, relaxing surroundings. Pizza Duo has a nice aesthetic for photos)

Korean Fried Chicken:  (Was considering K-Fry for this one, but open to other recommendations)

Japanese Souffle Pancakes: (They've never tried these, so was thinking Fluffed Cafe) 

Vietnamese Pho: (Big fan of Bahn Mi Cafe, but also open to recommendations) 

Damascus: (Picked this for the Shawarma meat platter, plus the upstairs ambience is quite nice) 

Thinking I may add a hot pot restaurant, and Banana leaf for novelty. Nasi Lemak and local flavors are on the list as well. Feel free to recommend any favorites or unique spots to try.

\- Pause Cafe: (The tiramisu here is killer, so definitely bringing them here

\- Licky Chan: (Fun gelato flavors worth a visit if we have time)

Ah, the Bitcoin ATM‚Äîyour friendly, futuristic gateway to the magical world of cryptocurrency. These marvels of modern technology are popping up in convenience stores, coffee shops, and even that quirky laundromat downtown. But what if I told you there's a way to supercharge your Bitcoin ATM experience? Enter the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker**‚Äîthe app that turns crypto convenience up to eleven.

Let‚Äôs dive into the exciting universe of Bitcoin ATMs and how our QR code wizardry makes the journey smoother, snappier, and dare I say, way cooler.

# Bitcoin ATMs: The Cash Machines of the Crypto World

If you‚Äôre imagining a clunky, Y2K-era cash machine with a digital facelift, think again. Bitcoin ATMs are sleek, efficient, and packed with tech-savvy pizzazz. These machines let you buy Bitcoin with cash or, in some cases, sell your Bitcoin for crisp dollar bills.

Here‚Äôs how they work:

1. **Locate**: Spot a Bitcoin ATM using apps or websites dedicated to tracking these beauties.
2. **Authenticate**: Prove you're not a crypto bot by scanning your ID or entering a phone number.
3. **Insert Cash**: Feed your hard-earned dollars into the machine, like a vending machine for digital gold.
4. **Get Bitcoin**: The ATM spits out a Bitcoin transaction straight to your wallet.

(Delonghi Stilosa),"Hey guys! so l'm a beginner in the espresso game, i have a Delonghi stilosa (low end i know) and have purchased a bottomless portafilter and am having trouble dialing it in.
It's a 51mm bottomless portafilter, i have a calibrated self leveling tamper, WDT tool, distributor, and grinder. So, i had started with pre ground starbucks espresso while i was figuring it out. that needed to be ground further since it was too coarse, but grinding that for about 10 seconds and using it in the portafilter that came with the machine works great. it doesn't however, work with the bottomless portafilter very well. i get really sour shots and it doesn't pour out evenly like i think it's supposed to. so then, i purchased some whole beans and have been grinding those, but no matter how fine or coarse i grind it (i've tried at least 10 different coarse/fine-ness settings on the grinder), the shot is still extremely sour. when i go too fine, it smells burnt when i pull it, which is what i think im expecting (rookie here). and when the shot looks somewhat ok(ground finer), it sprays everywhere out of one or 2 holes on the portafilter it seems, but pours ok out the rest. should i just give up on the bottomless portafilter? maybe the machine isn't designed to handle that since it's too low end? looking for any help/ suggestions!",0,1736907083.0,espresso,1,0.5,False

Most days it‚Äôs just me handling the phones, booking meetings, and juggling everyone's schedules. But then there‚Äôs Steve.

Steve is that one guy who shows up to work in flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt, no kidding. And no one really says anything because he‚Äôs senior management. He‚Äôs one of those people who could literally do anything and everyone just goes along with it because, well, Steve. He‚Äôs one of those guys who‚Äôs so laid-back it‚Äôs kind of unreal.

So last week, he rolls in about 15 minutes late for a meeting that‚Äôs been on the calendar for a week, holding a coffee in one hand and his phone in the other, completely in his own world. I‚Äôm sitting at my desk, trying to wrap my head around the fact that he‚Äôs late again, and he looks at me and says, ‚ÄúCan you print out the agenda for me real quick? Oh, and the client wants to push the meeting back. They were, uh, at a... thing.‚Äù

I‚Äôm trying to figure out what ‚Äúthing‚Äù means, but Steve‚Äôs already back to answering emails like nothing‚Äôs going on. So, I do my thing‚Äîreschedule, print, organize, you know the drill. It wasn‚Äôt a huge deal, just another day of keeping everything from falling apart.

Then Steve strolls into the meeting like it‚Äôs no big deal, cool as a cucumber, like he just walked out of a weekend BBQ. Everyone else in the meeting just nods like it‚Äôs totally normal. No one even bats an eye.

Honestly, sometimes I wonder if Steve knows something the rest of us don‚Äôt. But then again, I guess if you‚Äôre Steve, you can basically do whatever you want and people will just go with it. Some days I wish I could pull that off.",8,1736907078.0,coworkerstories,5,0.9,False

1i1mzck,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i1mzck/vityas_effigy_part_3/,Vitya's Effigy [Part 3],"Sandra‚Äôs funeral was small.¬† I hadn‚Äôt expected a whole bunch of people to show up, but there were only seven of us, not counting the priest.¬† Victor, Curly, Alice and I all rode together, while Daisy showed up later.¬† The other two people were an older couple, wrinkled and round, their faces etched with sorrow.¬† Curly told me they were Sandra‚Äôs parents.¬† It was a short service, but very sweet.¬† Mr. and Mrs. Gulley each giving a short eulogy for their daughter, highlighting how kind and creative and loving she had been.¬† I reminded myself to call my own mother once I got home.¬†¬†

The four of us went to lunch after the funeral, deciding to leave the gravesite proceedings to Sandra‚Äôs family.¬† Daisy said she wasn‚Äôt feeling well and went home early.¬† Victor didn‚Äôt let go of my hand the entire time we ate, constantly rubbing his thumb across my knuckles.¬† It was just as much a soothing behavior for him as it was comforting to me; he was never truly at rest unless his hands were occupied.¬† None of us really talked much, and by the time Victor and I got back to his house, he changed his clothes, went into his studio and didn‚Äôt come out the rest of the day, at least not until I went to tell him I‚Äôd made some food for us.¬† My mom had instilled cooking skills in me from a young age, so it wasn‚Äôt hard for me to whip up a batch of¬†*bibimbap,*¬†a traditional mixed rice dish, from whatever we had in the fridge.¬† I poked my head into the ground-floor studio, noticing him standing over a workbench with his back to me.

‚ÄúVic?‚Äù¬† He didn‚Äôt respond, tinkering with something on the workbench.¬† There was a sort of trance state he got into when he was working that wasn‚Äôt easily broken, but I‚Äôd accidentally discovered an effective way of snapping him out of it.¬† ‚ÄúHey, Vitya,‚Äù I called again, softer this time.¬†¬†

Something to know about Slavic names: most people don‚Äôt use a person‚Äôs government name unless they‚Äôre in a professional relationship or mere acquaintances, and will instead use a nickname.¬† The first time I called him that, Victor gave me a weird look and said no one had called him that besides his mother, and that was when he was a kid.¬† I felt a bit embarrassed and asked if I should not call him that, but he said he didn‚Äôt mind.¬† It made him feel safe, helped him ground himself.¬† This time, he glanced over his shoulder before turning around, hiding whatever he was working on behind his back.¬† I took a second to admire how he looked in his ‚Äúworking clothes‚Äù, a simple black tank top and a battered pair of jeans.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù he asked, trying to look casual.

‚ÄúI made dinner, you hungry?‚Äù

‚ÄúHuh?¬† Oh, uh, yeah, I‚Äôll be right up.‚Äù¬† He waved me off and grabbed a rag to wipe his hands.¬† I didn‚Äôt question what he was working on; my birthday was coming up, and he‚Äôd been hinting that he might make something for me as a present, and I knew he‚Äôd want it to be a surprise.¬†¬†

We ate dinner in silence, broken only by Victor telling me in a quiet tone that the food was good, and went to bed early, falling asleep with the TV on.¬† Both of us were exhausted.¬† Neither of us talked about Sandra.

There was a cloud over all of us at the next gallery night.¬† Curly didn‚Äôt wave at me this time, too focused on his banjo, and I noticed the fingertips of his picking hand were raw, almost to the point of bleeding.¬† I could tell Alice had been crying hard, and even the normally jovial Daisy was silent and sullen, her bruised arms constantly fidgeting.¬† Sandra‚Äôs animations were still playing in their usual place, and the grisly snapshot of her corpse had been replaced by a small memorial display showing a photo of her smiling.¬† Seeing it made me want to cry.¬† Maybe this is sick of me to say, but I almost preferred the crime scene photo.¬† I'd liked Sandra, even for the short time I'd known her, and the crime scene photo was just surreal enough that for a moment of looking at it, I could pretend she was still with us.

That was the first time the group of us didn't get dinner after the gallery closed.¬† Curly and Alice left together as soon as they could, while Daisy slipped out at some point before closing time.¬† I spent the night at Victor's as usual, but at around 3am I woke to find he wasn't next to me.¬† Inspiration tended to strike him at odd hours, but every time I'd stayed the night, he stayed in bed with me until the respectable time of nine in the morning.¬†¬†

When I went to his studio to check on him, I didn't find him working.¬† Instead, I found him sitting on a block of granite he'd just purchased recently, still in his pajamas, his head in his hands.¬† His shoulders were shaking.¬† Trying not to make too much noise, I descended the stairs, tucking my housecoat tighter around me, and rested a hand on his back.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I asked.¬† Stupid question, I know, but I felt like I had to say something.¬† Victor flinched, looking up at me with bloodshot eyes before wrapping his arms around me and dissolving into sobs.¬† I'd never heard him cry before‚Ä¶and I never wanted to hear it again.¬† All I could do was hold him.

‚ÄúDid I wake you?‚Äù he asked when he managed to calm himself a bit.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù¬† I combed my fingers through his messy hair.¬† ‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶do you want to talk about it?‚Äù¬† He took a long time to answer.

‚ÄúNot really.‚Äù¬† Classic Victor.¬† He rarely wanted to talk about things that truly bothered or hurt him.¬† I figured I could ask again tomorrow when he was rested and not so upset.

‚ÄúLet's go back to bed, all right?¬† It's late.‚Äù¬† He nodded, slowly and painfully unfolding his lanky body from the granite block.¬† He didn't always use his cane around the house as there were multiple surfaces he could lean on if his leg started bothering him, but I could tell it was stiff and sore, so I helped him up the stairs and back into bed before curling up next to him.

‚ÄúYou're too good to me, Livy,‚Äù he mumbled, grabbing my hand.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThat's because you deserve good.‚Äù¬† I sat up for a moment and kissed his forehead.¬† ‚ÄúGet some rest, Vitya.‚Äù

The next couple of weeks were about as normal as I could get.¬† Work was plentiful, my roommate and I went to a movie on Thursday, and on Friday I stayed over with Victor.¬† Saturday night came, and I really didn't want to go to the gallery, but I also didn't want Victor to be alone.¬† He'd never really had many people that supported his talent growing up: his mother had died when he was young, and his father, an austere Ukrainian carpenter whom Victor spoke highly of, had been more concerned with maintaining his furniture store than actively fostering his son's love of art.¬† I wanted to be that person for him.¬† I didn't tell him that the gallery gave me the creeps, as he probably would have insisted I stop going, and I wasn't going to let him be alone in the same building as that creepy statue.

Seeing him in that room with it‚Ä¶I didn't know what to think.¬† Maybe I should have asked him about it sooner.¬†¬†

Daisy didn't show up that night.¬† Or the next Saturday night.¬† I didn't know what to do.¬† None of the others knew where she lived, and I didn't want to make a nuisance of myself by calling the cops on her when she was probably just taking time to grieve.¬† However, after the third weekend in a row that she didn't come to the gallery, I had to do¬†*something.*¬† So I decided to call up another old college friend, Andrew B.¬† I'd hung out with him and his twin brother Austin (Victor's freckle-faced buddy) a lot during my sophomore year, though they'd graduated soon after and I had lost touch.¬† As far as I knew from social media, Andrew had become a cop within the last few years.¬† He might be able to help me.¬†¬†

It took him a while to answer the phone.

‚Äú*Hello?‚Äù*

‚ÄúYeah, hi, is this Andrew?‚Äù

*‚ÄúIt is, can I ask who's calling?‚Äù*¬†¬†

‚ÄúI don't know if you remember me, we went to the same uni a few years ago.¬† Olivia Song?‚Äù¬† There was a long pause.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúOh, yeah, Livy!¬† Of course I remember you, how've you been, girl?‚Äù*¬† The small talk persisted for a while before I got down to business.

‚ÄúI um‚Ä¶I didn't actually call just to reminisce.¬† There's something I need your help with.¬† Professionally.‚Äù¬†

*‚ÄúSure thing, whatcha need?‚Äù*¬† I knew I could count on Drew.¬† He'd always had a penchant for helping people.¬† Over the next hour or so, I gave him a summary of everything that happened.¬† I left out the part about the statue; Drew wasn't one to pooh-pooh the idea of the paranormal completely, but he was a certified skeptic.¬† He remained silent while I talked besides the occasional¬†*‚Äúuh-huh‚Äù*¬†¬†and ‚Äú*yeah?‚Äù*¬†to indicate he was still listening.¬†¬†*‚ÄúUgh, yeah, the Gulley-Ransom case.¬† You didn't hear this from me, but I was one of the responding officers on that one.‚Äù*

‚ÄúReally?‚Äù I asked.¬†¬†

‚Äú*Sure was.¬† I'll never forget it‚Ä¶poor lady.¬† No one deserves to go out like that.‚Äù*¬†¬†

‚ÄúAgreed.¬† But now another one of the group hasn't shown up for three weeks straight.¬† I'm really worried, she seemed super upset the last time I saw her.‚Äù¬† I could hear Andrew scuffling around in a desk or something before he seemed to find what he was looking for.¬† ‚ÄúI just‚Ä¶I want to check up on her, but I don't know where she lives.¬† I think maybe somebody should do a welfare check or something?¬† Is that what it's called?‚Äù

‚Äú*Yeah, I can see if I can get somebody on that.¬† What's her name?‚Äù*

‚ÄúDaisy.¬† It might not be her real name,‚Äù I warned, giving him her last name as well.¬† ‚ÄúYou know, weird art people, they like picking some fancy pseudonym for their work.‚Äù¬† Andrew chuckled, and I could hear the scratching of a pen.¬†¬†

*‚ÄúNo foolin‚Äô.¬† You remember Victor?‚Äù*¬†¬†

‚ÄúI mean‚Ä¶I've been dating him for the last couple months, so‚Ä¶‚Äù

*‚ÄúYou're*¬†*dating*¬†*him?‚Äù*¬†Andrew asked, an incredulous tone to his voice.¬†¬†*‚ÄúHuh.¬† Always thought the dude had an angle grinder for a heart.¬† Anyway, listen, I gotta run, it's my fiancee's birthday and I promised to take her out to dinner, but I‚Äôll take a look in the system.¬† I'll call you back if I find anything about your friend Daisy, okay?‚Äù*

‚ÄúAll right.¬† Thanks, Drew.¬† Tell Bridget I said hi and happy birthday, will you?‚Äù

*‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù*

‚ÄúWho was that?‚Äù my roommate asked as she came out of the bathroom, swathed in towels and looking like the star of a shampoo commercial.

‚ÄúOld college friend.¬† We still on for the¬†*Gilmore Girls*¬†marathon?‚Äù¬† Kristen laughed, toweling off her hair.

‚ÄúHoney, I will never pass up an opportunity to see baby-faced Jared.¬† Yes, we are still on.‚Äù

It took Andrew two days to get back to me.¬† He said what he‚Äôd found was serious enough that he couldn‚Äôt tell me over the phone, so I agreed to meet up with him at a local cafe.¬† I told Kristen where I was going and headed out, taking a jacket just in case.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs good to see you,‚Äù he said when I arrived at the cafe, pulling me in for a brief, brotherly side hug before we sat down.¬† We each ordered a drink before getting to the topic at hand.¬† ‚ÄúBefore I tell you this, you need to promise me you won‚Äôt tell anyone else.¬† It‚Äôs against policy to give out details of ongoing investigations, and I don‚Äôt wanna lose my job over this.¬† Frankly, I‚Äôm only giving you this information because you‚Äôre the one who brought it to our attention and because you‚Äôre my friend.¬† I wouldn‚Äôt do this for just anyone.‚Äù¬† I promised I would keep the info to myself.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI just want to know if Daisy‚Äôs okay,‚Äù I said.¬† Andrew was quiet for a long time before he slowly shook his head.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry,‚Äù he said.¬† ‚ÄúI hoped I‚Äôd have better news for you.‚Äù¬† He proceeded to tell me that he‚Äôd tracked down Daisy‚Äôs address (on the ‚Äúbad side‚Äù of town) and gotten his sergeant‚Äôs permission to carry out a welfare check.¬† Unfortunately, Daisy hadn‚Äôt needed a welfare check for a good while by the time the police came around.¬† ‚ÄúThe coroner hasn‚Äôt come out with the official report yet, but his initial estimate for how long she‚Äôs been dead is anywhere from a few days to maybe a week.¬† Again, we won‚Äôt know until he does the autopsy.¬† Probably.¬† She was um‚Ä¶she was in pretty bad shape, when we found her.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow bad?‚Äù I asked, my mind coming up with all sorts of horrible mental images.¬† He grimaced, taking a sip of his coffee.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt wanna know, Livy.¬† The general consensus is that she overdosed and went into a manic state before finally collapsing, but no one does all of¬†*that,*¬†even in a manic state.‚Äù¬† I leaned forward in my chair.

‚ÄúSo you think she was murdered‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep your voice down.‚Äù¬† Andrew shot me a warning look as another patron passed by on their way out the door.¬† I recalled just how much he was risking to tell me this and went quiet.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my job to say or not, but in my opinion, based on what I‚Äôve seen‚Ä¶there‚Äôs no way she did that to herself.‚Äù¬† I swallowed hard, suddenly getting a bit emotional.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDo you know if she has any family?‚Äù¬† He shook his head.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt find any.¬† I do know she had a baby when she was sixteen, but she gave the kid up for adoption pretty much as soon as it was born.¬† She really tried to clean herself up after that, got sober, went to rehab‚Ä¶‚Äù He trailed off, shaking his head again.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna level with you, Livy.¬† There‚Äôs something fishy going on here, and whatever it is, I think it has something to do with that art gallery you told me about.‚Äù¬† I stared into my latte for a few moments before getting an idea.

‚ÄúWhat if you came to see it?‚Äù I asked.¬† ‚ÄúNot in an official capacity, obviously, but you could come check it out for yourself.¬† It‚Äôs pretty disturbing, but you might be able to catch something I haven‚Äôt.‚Äù¬† I figured I could show him where the statue was when we both went to the gallery; I didn‚Äôt want to tell him beforehand and risk him not taking me seriously.¬† He thought it over for a moment.

‚ÄúCouldn‚Äôt hurt.¬† I can ask Bridget if she wants to come along, but I‚Äôm not sure she‚Äôd want to.¬† Honestly, weird art stuff was always more Austin‚Äôs thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen why not ask him if he‚Äôll come?‚Äù I asked.¬† ‚ÄúHe and Victor were close back in the day, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood point.‚Äù¬† I learned that Austin had managed to snag a job as a crime scene photographer at the same precinct Andrew worked at; it made sense, somehow.¬† Those two would likely have been inseparable even if they weren‚Äôt twins.

The gallery was busier than usual that night, the disappearance of two of its artists having caused a bit of a stir.¬† I met the twins across the street from the little stone church, and we headed inside, Austin looking about as nervous as I felt.¬† He‚Äôd always been fairly timid and introspective, only opening up if Andrew happened to be around.¬† Letting the twins take in the gallery at their own pace, I went to find Victor.¬† He didn‚Äôt like surprises, and I‚Äôd forgotten to text him that they were coming along.¬† I was sure he knew Andrew was a cop, but I didn‚Äôt want to point that out and give him the indication that something was wrong.¬†¬†

Coming back to where the twins were milling around, I found Austin staring at a framed photograph on a pedestal, his face blanched and drawn.¬† Before I could ask if he was feeling all right, he called out for his brother, stuffing his hands in his pockets.¬† Andrew poked his head around a corner, a concerned expression on his face.¬† Clearly he‚Äôd heard something in Austin‚Äôs tone that he didn‚Äôt like.

‚ÄúLet me guess,‚Äù he said, folding his arms.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to want to see this?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù Austin said, jabbing one long finger at the picture.¬† ‚ÄúI think you are.‚Äù¬† He sounded equal parts angry and scared, and Andrew speed-walked over to see what had him so upset.¬† I did as well, peering at the photo and initially failing to understand what I was seeing.¬† Austin pulled Andrew to the side for a moment and whispered in his ear, frequently glancing back at the pedestal.

‚ÄúWhat am I looking at here?‚Äù I asked, and both of the twins jumped, as if they‚Äôd quite forgotten I was there.¬† Austin ran a shaking hand through his hair before semi-calmly explaining that the picture in front of me was an autopsy photo, taken not even a few days ago.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDaisy \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*, thirty-six years old, cause of death‚Ä¶heroin overdose,‚Äù he muttered, unable to take his eyes off the photo.¬† So I‚Äôd been right; ‚ÄúFay‚Äù wasn‚Äôt her legal surname.¬† ‚ÄúThere was a ton of other shit that happened to her, but the coroner couldn‚Äôt figure out whether they happened pre- or post-mortem.‚Äù¬† I looked back at the photo, noticing strange tiny white lumps in the middle of the cut-open chest cavity.

‚ÄúWhat are those?‚Äù¬† I couldn‚Äôt tell just from looking at them, or even what organ they appeared to be stuffed inside of.¬† Austin swallowed hard.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOver-the-counter ibuprofen.¬† We still don‚Äôt know how they got in there.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn where?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make me say it.¬† I‚Äôm never going to be able to unsee it.‚Äù¬† Andrew cleared his throat.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure, and don‚Äôt quote me on this, I wasn‚Äôt present for the autopsy, that that‚Äôs the victim‚Äôs uterus.‚Äù¬† I felt a wave of nausea squirm through my own abdomen upon hearing that.¬† ‚ÄúWhoever did this, they‚Äôre one sick bastard.¬† Creative, but sick.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow do you mean?‚Äù¬† Now it was Andrew‚Äôs turn to fidget and look uncomfortable.¬† He stepped a bit closer to me and lowered his voice.

‚ÄúWhen we found Miss \*\*\*\*\*\*\* in her home, she was um‚Ä¶listen, Livy, I‚Äôm not sure how PG I can be with this.‚Äù¬† I shook my head.

‚ÄúJust tell me.¬† I‚Äôve probably seen worse.‚Äù¬† He took a deep breath.

‚ÄúWe found her basically‚Ä¶*crucified.*¬† She was laid out on the floor with syringes through her wrists and ankles.‚Äù

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù I muttered.¬†¬†

‚ÄúPretty much,‚Äù Andrew answered.¬† I turned my attention back to Austin.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow do you know so much about the autopsy?‚Äù¬† Austin looked over at Andrew, tilting his head.¬† Andrew nodded.¬† Austin‚Äôs shoulders slumped.

‚ÄúBecause I took the fucking photo.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚Äú*What?‚Äù*¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhich means,‚Äù Andrew chimed in, folding his arms, ‚Äúthat somehow, someone broke into the police station and got the photo off the SD card.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the police station?‚Äù I asked.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt take my work camera home with me,‚Äù Austin explained.¬† ‚ÄúPreservation of evidence is really important, so I put it in a locker at the end of the day.¬† Electronic locks, even, it should be impossible to break into.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs no way you could have left the locker open?‚Äù¬† I wanted to believe that my friends were better at their jobs than that, but journalists have to ask all the questions.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt locks automatically, so no,‚Äù Austin said, shuffling his feet a bit.¬† ‚ÄúIt only opens if I scan my ID.¬† Or if the power goes out, but nobody is supposed to know that.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy brother is very particular about the handling of his camera,‚Äù Andrew said, patting Austin‚Äôs shoulder.¬† ‚ÄúWon‚Äôt even let anyone else touch it.‚Äù¬† Austin nudged his twin in the ribs with one bony elbow, grumbling something about people messing with the settings.¬†¬†

The discovery of an official autopsy photo was what finally got the gallery shut down for a few weeks while the police investigated.¬† Of course, Victor and I had a visit from a couple of polite but very serious detectives who asked us a ton of questions about the gallery.

For a while, I thought that would be the end of it.¬† Now that he wasn‚Äôt constantly working on some new thing for the gallery every single week, I could finally manage to get Victor to take a break.¬† We went out for dinner more often, visited museums, went to a couple movies, and for at least a short period of time, we both went to bed at the same time each night.

But then one day, we were sitting on the couch, sharing a bowl of popcorn as we watched¬†*Mrs. Doubtfire.*¬† It was one of my favorites, and he‚Äôd never seen it before.¬† Right before the scene where Mrs. Doubtfire absolutely beans the stepdad guy with a lime, Victor‚Äôs phone rang.¬† He picked it up with a deadpan expression, and I paused the movie.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù¬† There was frantic speech I couldn‚Äôt make out on the other end.¬† ‚ÄúCurly, your Texas is showing, I understood exactly zero percent of what you just said.¬† Calm down.¬† No, don‚Äôt talk¬†*louder,*¬†talk¬†*slower.*¬† Okay, I‚Äôm putting you on speakerphone, I‚Äôm with Livy right now.¬† Go take a drink of water, it will slow down your breathing.‚Äù¬† He put the phone on speaker, setting it on his knee.¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Curly,‚Äù he said to me.¬† ‚ÄúHe sounds upset.‚Äù

‚ÄúDarn it, I¬†*am*¬†upset!‚Äù Curly‚Äôs disgruntled voice came through the phone.¬† I heard a gulp; he must have taken Victor‚Äôs advice about the water.¬† ‚ÄúListen, V, it‚Äôs Alice.¬† She ain‚Äôt answered her phone for three days now, and she never does that.¬† Like, you know the settings on the phone where you can see if somebody read the text?¬† She hasn‚Äôt read her texts!¬† That ain‚Äôt normal, not for Alice.‚Äù¬† I raised an eyebrow at Victor.¬†¬†

‚ÄúHave you considered going to her apartment?‚Äù he asked, sounding less annoyed and more concerned by the second.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm there now, I‚Äôm outside the building.¬† I just talked to her landlady, and she says Alice ain‚Äôt left the apartment for quite a while.¬† No visitors either, just some old lady she thought was her grandma or somethin‚Äô.¬† I‚Äôve got half a mind to call the cops, man, somethin‚Äôs wrong.¬† I can feel it.‚Äù¬† There was a long silence.

‚ÄúAll right, don‚Äôt panic.¬† We‚Äôll come over, maybe she‚Äôs in a composing mood,‚Äù Victor said.¬† Curly gave him the address of Alice‚Äôs apartment building, and they said a brief goodbye before hanging up.¬† I set aside the popcorn as Victor went to grab his keys.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming with you,‚Äù I said.¬† If something was going on with Alice, I wanted to help.¬† I clearly didn‚Äôt know her as well as Curly did, but I still cared about her.¬† Victor nodded, and I slipped into my shoes before following him to the garage.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI suggest you call Sherri and Terri on the way.¬† It might be nice to have some law enforcement presence without swarming the place with police,‚Äù Victor said on the way.¬† I racked my brain for a moment before I realized he meant the twins.

‚ÄúYou know they have actual names, right?‚Äù¬† He shrugged.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funnier this way.¬† Besides, they‚Äôre the only pair of twins I‚Äôve met who don‚Äôt have a weird sexual thing going on.‚Äù¬† I rolled my eyes and pulled out my phone.

The twins had already arrived by the time we got to Alice‚Äôs apartment building, and we found them talking to Curly, trying to calm him down.¬† I could hear faint cello music filtering down from an open window, which I assumed belonged to Alice.¬† It sounded‚Ä¶wrong, somehow.¬† Harsh and grating, not at all like her usual playing.¬†¬†

‚Äú--dunno what the rules are for this kinda thing,‚Äù Curly said as we approached, ‚Äúbut is there any way y‚Äôall can just, y‚Äôknow, go in there?¬† Do a welfare check or whatever it‚Äôs called.¬† I knocked on the door a little bit ago, but I don‚Äôt think she can hear me.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWell, we talked to the landlady ourselves,‚Äù Andrew said, ‚Äúand she told us that the cello music has been playing for at least forty-eight hours.¬† Non-stop.¬† That alone is enough cause for us to go in and check.‚Äù¬† He looked up at the building, tilting his head.¬† Austin mirrored the gesture almost subconsciously, something that had always freaked me out a bit.¬†¬†

The music only got louder as we got near the apartment door.¬† Andrew knocked firmly on the door.

‚ÄúAlice?¬† This is the police, can you come to the door?‚Äù¬† No break in the music, no indication that she had heard us outside.¬† Andrew tried a few more times, with no answer each time.¬† ‚ÄúOkay.¬† I think we‚Äôre going to have to break down the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt you call for backup?‚Äù I asked, but he shook his head.

‚ÄúIf she‚Äôs been playing continuously for an entire two days and then some, she hasn‚Äôt stopped to eat, drink, sleep, nothing.¬† She‚Äôs not gonna be in great shape, we need to get in there and figure out if we need to call an ambulance or not.‚Äù¬† He waved us off.¬† ‚ÄúMight want to stand back.‚Äù¬† The hallway wasn‚Äôt very wide to allow for a running start, but the door wasn‚Äôt very sturdy in the first place, and with a swift kick from both of the twins, we were in.

Immediately, we were hit with an intense, coppery smell, tinged with something acidic.¬† Curly barged in ahead of us, calling for Alice, and disappeared into a separate room for only a few moments before suddenly letting out a startled yell.¬† The twins rushed after him, and Victor and I followed at a slower pace to the living room at the back of the apartment.

‚ÄúHoly shit,‚Äù said Andrew.

‚ÄúOh my God,‚Äù said Austin.

Victor said something in Ukrainian that was probably not repeatable in polite company.

I couldn‚Äôt say anything.¬†¬†

Now we knew where the smell had been coming from.¬†¬†

A cello lay broken on the red-stained floor, stripped of its strings and bridges.

And yet, Alice kept playing.

1i1myxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1i1myxn/my_journey_through_anxiety/,My Journey Through Anxiety,"Hello everyone! This is my first-ever Reddit post, and I don‚Äôt usually do this, but I wanted to share my experience in hopes of helping others in the community.  
  
It all started when I had a sudden panic attack that triggered a period of intense anxiety in my life. During that time, I found myself constantly searching for success stories and ways people managed to ""cure"" their anxiety (which is also my main reason of posting this). While there may not be a definitive cure, it is possible to relive life the way we were doing before our anxiety issues became our focus. I realized that I had experienced anxious moments throughout my life‚Äîeven before my major anxiety issues‚Äîbut I just hadn't focused on them much. I also learned that, while a complete cure may not exist, *working on yourself can significantly improve your life, allowing those anxious moments to fade away quickly and become less bothersome*. From the beginning I had the hope that once I discover the strategies that work for me, the constant worrying and anxiety will be gone, and that is how it turned out to be.  
  
I‚Äôd like to share some parts of my journey and what helped me along the way. I had my first panic attack at 24, and until that point, I had never experienced any major anxiety episode. After that incident, my life spiraled downward and I hit rock bottom. It affected my sleep, eating habits, studying, and social life. I lost confidence in many areas. For quite a while, life felt dull and colorless. Living overseas meant my parents were unaware of my situation. I reached out to my brother for help, and *I encourage anyone struggling to do the same. It‚Äôs important to talk to someone you trust.* He suggested I see a psychologist.   
  
Through my university, I consulted both a psychiatrist and a psychologist. I tried medications for a month but ultimately decided to continue my journey without them. Working with a psychologist helped me understand how my brain and anxiety functioned, reducing my fear when panic episodes would occur. One of the *most helpful strategies I learned from my psychologist, was to consider the worst-case scenario and accept that outcome.* I saw that 99.9 percent of the time, the worst scenario doesn‚Äôt happen, which helps rewire the brain to recognize that not all panic thoughts will become reality. When I faced again situations that once triggered my anxiety, I would still consider the worst-case scenario, but deep down, I knew it was unlikely to occur. And that's when I started to build confidence. *There are many other strategies to explore, so find what works best for you.* After a year, I stopped seeing my therapist, and while I experienced occasional anxiety attacks, they were much more manageable.   
  
*Some positive changes I made included regularly exercising (gym/home workouts), doing sports, cutting caffeine (even though I love coffee, I switched to decaf), cutting sugars (this is huge), drinking relaxing teas (chamomile is my favorite), and practicing yoga.*   
  
Also anxiety is closely tied to our perspective. For example instead of searching for things that trigger worry‚Äîlike asking, 'Does X painkiller make you anxious?' and potentially finding negative experiences. Try looking for positive information, e.g. you could search for 'X painkiller also helps with anxiety' and discover stories from people who felt less anxious after using it. This approach can apply to anything. The key point is to seek out the positive.  
  
Now back to my life story: eventually, I had another major panic attack, and it felt like my struggles were repeating. However, having gone through it before, I was able to recover much faster. And I believe the more we experience hardships and get through them, the stronger we become. My message to all of the people that are struggling is please focus on yourself and work on strategies to cope with anxiety. Be sure that things will get better. My life is proof of that, and even when we stumble, we can rise again. May God bless you all.  
  
I‚Äôd like to conclude this post with lyrics from one of my favorite songs, ""[Dax - Catch the Rain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qO8MnAesHU)"":  
  
""Every day I pray that all this pain will go away  
I hold my faith and trust that God will lead the way  
I know I'll make it through the storm and through the rain  
And I won't break until I see a brighter day.""",1,1736906888.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Hi guys, I‚Äôm a 24f finishing out my college this December. 

My niece just turned 14 and overnight I feel like I‚Äôm not as cool to her as I was literally less than a year ago. My family got her a laptop and she‚Äôs now a gamer girl trying to be like her dad which is very cute to me. 

Last spring break, we talked a lot about life and she went home and followed me on instagram, I was the only family member allowed. I shared a funny video of her when she was younger once, but that was it, I didn‚Äôt bother her. 

This last thanksgiving, I bought my new boyfriend, with me and she wanted to stay the night with us in the guest trailer my parent set up for the holiday. I was flattered until we got there and the only reason why she wanted to go was to play games on her computer in private. I‚Äôm glad I gave her that free space from her littler sisters, but I couldn‚Äôt get more than one sentence out before she put her headphones back on. I offered to get her an ice coffee or caffeine free drink and she declined. Just wanted to back my parents/ grandparents house in the morning and did not speak to me very much, maybe it‚Äôs because of my boyfriend? She can be shy sometimes so that what I‚Äôve been telling myself. 

I just realized I am removed as a follower on her account, not blocked, but feeling a bit lame, but oh well.

Advice I‚Äôm looking for is, would current preteens/ teens of today think it‚Äôs weird if their 24 year old aunt sends them memes and what not? Not gonna spam but sometimes I think of her and I want to remind her I‚Äôm there if she ever needs anything. when she was born, I was old enough to babysit her and had to do it quite often for free, even when I didn‚Äôt exactly want to, so not gonna lie my heart feels a bit ripped out, what do you youngling think?

We did ANTHEM OF THE SEAS last year and I'm currently on Carnival Celebration and I have no idea what people are talking about comparing Carnival to RC.

Service in RC felt like a 5 star hotel, I was amazed how good was it. In Carnival it feels they don't have enough crew, service is bad, slow and isn't attentive as RC.

EVERYTHING but Everything is better in RC... First the Lido buffet in Carnival is trash, 3 star hotel American food. All cheap carbs and meat, nothing healthy, nothing light, no salads, no vegetables, no salmon or avocado or anything that isn't cheap unhealthy food.
The selection is nothing like Royal that had so much options we never even thought about eating breakfast anywhere else. In Carnival after 2 days I can't see the disgusting buffet again.

NO coffee shop in the Lido in Carnival! If don't want to drink trash burned coffee in the buffet you don't have any other options in Carnival while Royal put an actual coffee stand that makes quality coffee.

The pools in Carnival are a joke, super small and spread all over the ship, the kids pool is accessible by 2 elevatoronly and the one in Royal is 10 times better. Also
No food near the kids pool in Carnival which is a joke. The kids pool in Royal was near the adult one and near multiple large hot tubs, in Carnival the kids pool is not even in the same deck!

Water slides and amusement areas in Royal were better in every way possible.

The Royal shows are amazing while the ones in Carnival are okay... Nothing more.

Rooms are similar in quality, the crowds were actually great which I was afraid of in Carnival.

Elevators are crap in both of them.

Background in sales. He is still working in this role part-time. His instagram looks very impressive, he wrote a book which he talks a lot about and promotes, but when I looked on Amazon, it had 3 reviews. Yet to read/review this book however!

However, scrolling through his instagram, he has posted some content that makes me...question things. Firstly, sharing some video from a bizarre account talking about suing companies that encouraged Covid vaccines. Secondly, a video he filmed of himself saying 'coffee cups are killing you!' regarding microplastics. It is quite sensationalist. Whatever, he is entitled to his opinion, but my mind always trusts microbiologists and chemists on topics like this. He also didn't cite any research in his video, which is making me question his critical thinking.

He hangs around a lot of life coaching types of people, who I have been burned by before (both narcissists) but I don't want to pigeonhole the whole industry yet.

Article:
FEDERAL POLITICS
Peter Dutton‚Äôs new slogan, ‚ÄúBack on track‚Äù, is more evidence that he wants to go back to John Howard‚Äôs white picket fence version of Australia. He has told us very little about what he will do.
Cheaper electricity? No details and big doubts if, as he says, the government will develop and operate his proposed nuclear plants. Even if they can do it, we won‚Äôt see anything for 20-30 years.
What are Dutton‚Äôs plans to ‚Äúsolve‚Äù the housing crisis? He has consistently opposed or delayed any of the measures that the current government has tried to legislate yet he offers no alternative other than the likelihood of more tax incentives for investors.
Voters need to be wary of Dutton‚Äôs vision, which would undoubtedly divide us.
Frank O‚ÄôConnor, Albert Park

Backwards and backyards
Very wise of federal Labor to apparently ditch the re-election slogan, ‚ÄúWe have your back‚Äù, because down our way, this translates at the state level to: ‚ÄúWe have your backyard and home in our sights‚Äù. It‚Äôs Labor that has allowed the ‚ÄúGreat Wall of Frankston‚Äù to proceed and if they think (the inevitable) Gold Coast high-rise all along our bay is ‚Äúbuilding Australia‚Äôs future‚Äù, count us out.
Likewise, $50 billion of ‚Äúdebt building‚Äù for the southern Suburban Rail Loop when the west and north are desperate for transport.
Yes, the LNP‚Äôs ‚Äúback on track‚Äù slogan quietly ‚Äútaps into people‚Äôs nostalgia‚Äù for managed immigration, home ownership, health, education and safety. Most people respect serving and former police officers. Peter Dutton just needs to ‚Äústep back‚Äù, admit mistakes and reassess nuclear energy.
James Richardson, Langwarrin

Face the future
Any political party that includes the word ‚Äúback‚Äù in its slogan is making a huge marketing error. The reality is that we can never go back in time, only forward. We want a party that can face the future with new solutions in these times of rapid change.
Kevan Porter, Alphington

Playing the man won‚Äôt work
Anthony Albanese should reflect on the outcome of the Democratic Party‚Äôs election strategy that focused primarily on demonising Donald Trump. It backfired and delivered him the presidency. Playing the man, (‚ÄúPM dodges citizenship stoush with ‚Äònasty‚Äô Dutton‚Äù, 14/1) won‚Äôt work in Australia either.
Martin Newington, Aspendale

The master of identity politics
As the election campaign begins, The Age informs readers that Peter Dutton has stated he will ‚Äúpush back against identity politics‚Äù (‚ÄúDutton pitches suburban battler roots, calls for ‚Äòeducation not indoctrination‚Äô,‚Äù 12/1). Yet Dutton is the best exponent of identity politics in our current parliament, with his comments about African gangs, Lebanese refugees, Gaza refugees, international students and ‚ÄúMuslim candidates from Western Sydney‚Äù, among others. It seems that whenever he can find a group to criticise and ostracise, he is right on to them. And of course Indigenous Australians, who don‚Äôt deserve a Voice because ‚Äúwe are all equal‚Äù despite the huge disparities in health and economic outcomes.
Andrew Cochrane, Essendon

Damaging community cohesiveness
Peter Dutton‚Äôs claim that ‚Äúevery incident of antisemitism can be traced back to the prime minister‚Äôs dereliction of leadership in response to the sordid events on the steps of the Sydney Opera House‚Äù is without substance, and weaponises the conflict of the present appalling Israel/Gaza war. The causes of this war are far too complex to be discussed within the framework of such an over-simplistic goodies v baddies perspective. How can such statements improve Australian community cohesiveness which Dutton claims he would improve if elected prime minister?
Jennifer Gerrand, Carlton North

Be constructive
It is obvious that we are already in federal election mode, despite not knowing the poll date. May I remind members of all political parties that the first, and most important rule, of debating (as we were taught back in school) is ‚Äúattack the policy, not the person and present a constructive and informed alternative‚Äù.
Petrushka Owen, Hawthorn
Political (tele)vision
My prescription may be harsh, but it‚Äôs necessary and, ultimately, effective. The frontbench should immerse themselves in Kath & Kim to better understand the cultural pulse of those who voted ‚Äúno‚Äù in the Voice referendum. The backbench, on the other hand, should take in The Moodys. People in the suburbs don‚Äôt have the luxury of long-term thinking ‚Äî they live day to day. A pool in the backyard is a long-term dream, and they‚Äôre more concerned about what‚Äôs happening right now.
To regain perspective, the entire team should watch Upper Middle Bogan ‚Äî it‚Äôs a sharp reminder of the world as most Australians see it.
When it comes to foreign policy, forget the global stage. Focus on what your neighbour‚Äôs doing for the weekend. It‚Äôs a small, local world that Peter Dutton has embraced, and it‚Äôs the world where his predecessors thrived. If the ALP can‚Äôt adapt to this reality, it risks being sidelined (again) entirely.
Tom Pagonis, Hawthorn

THE FORUM
Don‚Äôt slug the public
The proposed reduction in feed-in tariff for solar generated energy to .04¬¢ per per kilowatt-hour (‚ÄúVictorians with rooftop solar will get virtually nothing for feeding power to the grid‚Äù, 10/1 and Letters 13/1) is supposedly solving an engineering problem because the energy generated makes it difficult to run coal-fired generation. The proposed new solar tariff will presumably reduce future solar growth. However, for existing customers, they should retain their existing tariff. It is too easy to slug the public for what is a supplier problem.
If there is too much daytime solar power being generated, the energy companies should provide more community battery installations and store the energy.
Alex Brown, Camberwell

A price we can pay
In 2017 I saw Al Gore‚Äôs An Inconvenient Sequel, which inspired me to increase the number of solar panels on my roof from eight to 24, well aware that it would result in the loss of the extremely generous feed-in tariff I was then receiving, and that I‚Äôd be paying an electricity bill each two months instead of receiving a credit. And to also install 20 solar panels on each of the two rental properties I own.
The price paid by electricity retailers for power generated should be no different for household solar systems as it is for coal power plants, which are often forced to sell their electricity at almost zero price because of an abundance of solar power.
It should be welcomed that the feed-in tariff for solar power will be almost zero during off-peak periods (‚ÄúBait and switch,‚Äù Letters 14/1). It will encourage private businesses to install large storage batteries on their property to buy surplus electricity cheaply and to resell it back to the grid at a higher price when it‚Äôs needed.
It‚Äôs only ethical to accept a small financial cost in order to help avoid catastrophic global heating.
Wayne Robinson, Kingsley

Shop around
Many people are under the impression solar feed-in tariffs are set by the Victorian Essential Services Commission and these are mandated to fall almost to zero. This isn‚Äôt correct. The VESC sets the minimum price. The actual feed-in tariff depends on individual retailer plans and these vary a lot.
As always, people should shop around. Many retailers don‚Äôt advertise all their plans so you need to phone them and convince them to give further details. Finally, you need to do your own full 12-month comparison as comparison websites only compare one to three months, which will be inaccurate.
Mark Freeman, Macleod

Brand Melbourne a winner
I was saddened to see that your correspondent thinks the Australian Open is too corporate and has lost its way (‚ÄúTennis elite‚Äù, Letters, 14/2). I made some wonderful new friends from the US while visiting on Monday and even spoke to Nick Kyrgios‚Äô brother at a pop-up, which changed my whole perspective about him.
It was all free of charge. There will be the same influencers at NGV events who aren‚Äôt interested in the arts but the exposure attracts a whole new generation to the gallery ‚Äì it‚Äôs called marketing.
The winner here is brand Melbourne and it demonstrates that we are a cosmopolitan and sophisticated city. Nothing manipulative at all, just evolving with the times.
Mel Smith, Brighton

Ugly fans
As a tennis lover and someone who has been stunned by some of the feats which Nick Kyrgios has performed over the years, I must say that Monday night‚Äôs crowd behaviour at his first-round singles match was appalling. The ugly Australian reared its head. The delirious cheering whenever his opponent Jacob Fearnley lost a point or even just faulted on his first serve. Quite obviously the Kyrgios fans have never been involved in playing tennis and are simply bewitched by the circus that Kyrgios brings. Congratulations to Fearnley who played extremely well under great pressure.
Alan Muir, Mount Eliza

Too much of a good thing
Just because some sporting events have been going for decades without change doesn‚Äôt mean that they can‚Äôt be improved, especially with more concerns for players‚Äô health nowadays. I feel very worried when I see tennis players out for three or four hours in Melbourne‚Äôs summer heat. There is no reason the Australian Open can‚Äôt be changed to the best of three sets, like most tournaments in the world now.
David Ginsbourg, East Bentleigh

AO-kay
Full marks to the AO volunteers who provide mobility assistance at the gates and then will wheelchair those who need it to the stands. Our day at the Rod Laver Arena today was greatly enhanced by their friendly support, and they wheeled my husband back afterwards. And full credit too, for the water stations and sunscreen spots: all they need now are plenty more coffee places, please, this being Melbourne! Thanks AO.
Peta Colebatch, Hawthorn

Too much slamming
I am sick of watching Australian Open players lose their temper and belt the living daylights out of their racquet. This is not professional behaviour. And I can‚Äôt understand why the tournament organisers put up with it. I love the Australian Open but this behaviour has got to stop.
Brian Noble, Taylors Hill

Fertile compost
A refreshing article by Tony Wright naming and explaining the rationale for his ‚Äúshambolic‚Äù office moves over the years (‚ÄúThere is literally a word for my chaos‚Äù, 14/1). I remember, when I was a university student, the writer, Carmel Bird, explaining the ‚Äúcompost of the brain‚Äù. She meant all the valuable things we accumulate in our heads over time and the fertile writing that results. In the same way, Wright has the added concrete bonus of an accumulation of paper riches through texts, articles and research scattered, nay piled, on his desk and in cupboards so secret some are unknown even to him.
We must defeat ‚Äútidy‚Äù. Who could live in those homes for sale with acres of clean empty benches? Do the leaders who speak to us earnestly on TV anchored to vast empty desks even have any knowledge of their topic? Do those people smartly, appropriately and neatly attired in newspapers have any lived experience of parties and travel? Go Tony!
Jan Marshall, Brighton

Work wonders
The way that Tony Wright writes about his desk, it sounds worthy of a stop in a ‚Äúwonders of the office‚Äù tour. I thoroughly understand his approach to file management and retention of all manner of materials. Of course something might come in handy one day so it should be kept for disinterring when, not if, that day comes. When all around is sterile, neat and joyless, a lived-in work desk is a joy to behold. And just remember, while the joyless come to work and clean their desks, the joyful come to work.
Greg Hunt, Oak Park

Serendipitous finds
Tony Wright is my favourite writer in The Age. And yes, he‚Äôs right. The OED is the dictionary to use when you‚Äôre looking for the apposite word. As for the people who use the internet screen exclusively, they simply don‚Äôt understand the rite of searching for a word in the printed OED and, in the process, coming across interesting new words.
Elizabeth Sprigg, Glen Iris

Protect other walkers
With respect to your correspondent (‚ÄúLost advice‚Äù, Letters, 14/1), I would have thought ‚Äúdo not leave anyone behind‚Äù is the first rule of bushwalking. People become separated from groups for all sorts of reasons, not all of which are wilful failures to adhere to the group‚Äôs instructions. People leave well-defined tracks all the time but these same well-defined tracks can become invisible due to fading light or just viewed from a different perspective. And then there are people who are simply left behind when they don‚Äôt keep up with the stronger walkers, and nobody thinks it their responsibility to wait for them.
Claude Miller, Castlemaine

Misused levy
I have a question for Jacinta Allan, if Victorians are paying over $1billion in fire levy charges in our rates, why are our fire trucks old (‚ÄúWarning on ageing fire trucks‚Äù, 14/1)? That levy was introduced by the Napthine Coalition government in 2013 to fund a robust fire service in the wake of the 2009 bushfire disaster. By my reckoning the first step in an effective fire service is to have state-of-the-art, front line fire trucks.

Any ideas how I can monetise this effectively? I'm mostly looking to break even / cover my costs at this stage.

1i1ml9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bumble/comments/1i1ml9b/men_youre_also_confusing/,men - you‚Äôre also confusing ,"i (25f) know men say women are confusing, but so are men! i matched with a guy (31m) last weekend, and right away he asked me out for drinks. we chatted a bit on the app for about a day until i gave him my phone number; if we‚Äôre planning to meet up, we can move off of the app. 

we do a little texting here and there, and i offered that i was free on friday night and sunday morning if he wanted to do coffee (we discussed drinks and coffee, depending on when we‚Äôre both available). he said he already had plans both days, but if his sunday clear up he‚Äôd let me know. but if that weekend didn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôd shoot for next. i didn‚Äôt hear from him at all for about 5 days; he stopped replying mid conversation, but it was still getting to know each other type of conversing, so i figured maybe he just would text me when he‚Äôs free and we could continue the conversation in person. 

i don‚Äôt chase, but i will initiate effort a little bit just so it isn‚Äôt on the guy. we‚Äôre all human and both parties deserve to feel wanted. anyway, i texted him last night asking if he was still open to getting drinks this upcoming weekend. he texted back that he was sick and out of it, but he‚Äôd be down if he was feeling better. that‚Äôs it, and no reply to my other messages that were ignored. i said no worries, just to let me know and to feel better. 

i know this could be a ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not that into you‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs probably already seeing someone else‚Äù. but my question is, why ask someone out, text their phone number and initiate making plans, but then back off once i start to seem more interested in the idea? and im really not trying to be rude when saying this, but guys already reiterate they don‚Äôt get many matches so if anything, i feel like a guy should be super excited that a girl he matched with wants to go out, and follows up about the plans! it could also be most who he is as a person, but just curious to get other perspectives!

1i1mjnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1i1mjnm/turning_failed_amazon_returns_into_5kmo/,Turning Failed Amazon Returns into $5k/mo,"Ever scrolled through your order history and realized you never returned that weird kitchen gadget you swore you‚Äôd send back? You‚Äôre not alone. Millions of people sit on Amazon returns past the refund window, crossing their fingers it‚Äôll magically handle itself. That‚Äôs where you come in with a brand-new side hustle.

The beauty of this hustle? Your customers give you their unwanted stuff for free. When you sell it, you keep 20-30% of the profits and send them the rest. They win by getting money they‚Äôd otherwise kiss goodbye, and you win by flipping their lost returns into sweet side-hustle income. Let‚Äôs talk about turning this little operation into a $5k/month moneymaker.

**The MVP (Getting your first customer)**

Find Your First Batch of Items:

* Start with your own stuff lying around the house. Get used to selling stuff online (if you haven‚Äôt already).

Sell friends and family items:

* Post on your personal social media explaining how you‚Äôll take their ‚Äúforgot-to-return Amazon purchases,‚Äù sell them, and split the profits.
* They hand over random items for free‚Äîeverything from clothing to electronics‚Äîbecause they‚Äôre already out the money.
* You‚Äôll handle listing, shipping, and dealing with buyers.

Establish Your Profit Split:

* Charge 20-30% of the sale price for your service. Keep it simple and transparent: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take your item, list it for you, and you get 70-80% of whatever it sells for.‚Äù

List Items on Multiple Platforms

* eBay, OfferUp, Facebook Marketplace, Mercari, Poshmark: Cast a wide net.
* Make sure to shoot decent photos and write clear, honest descriptions.

**Numbers Breakdown (First Batch)**

Suppose you pick up 5 items worth about $50 each in resale value.

You sell them for $250 total.

You keep 25% = $62.50.

Your friend/family member gets $187.50 for what was basically junk in their closet.

Now you‚Äôve got cash in hand, social proof, and you‚Äôre off to the races.

  
**Getting Your Next 100 Customers**

Ready to go bigger? The good news is people everywhere have random Amazon items collecting dust. Let‚Äôs tap into that gold mine.

1. Social Media Blitz:
   * Create a Facebook Business Page or Instagram account called something like ‚ÄúAmazon Return Rescue‚Äù or ‚ÄúForgot-to-Return.‚Äù
   * Post photos of items you‚Äôve sold, before-and-after stories, and testimonials from happy folks who got money back.
   * Encourage shares, likes, and comments to reach more potential customers.
2. Referral Program
   * Offer your existing clients (friends, family, early customers) a 10% bonus on their next item if they refer someone who has at least one item to sell.
   * Word-of-mouth is powerful here‚Äîeveryone‚Äôs got that buddy who forgot to return a cat hammock or electronic doodad.
3. Local Ads & Community Boards
   * Put up flyers at community centers, coffee shops, or anywhere with a bulletin board.
   * Pitch it as a hassle-free way to make money back on items that are otherwise collecting dust.
   * Emphasize your ‚Äúno risk‚Äù model: If it doesn‚Äôt sell, they haven‚Äôt lost anything (they were going to toss or donate it anyway).
4. Small Business Collabs
   * Some local businesses end up with overstock, returns, or open-box items from Amazon vendor programs. Offer to handle their liquidation for a cut.
   * They free up space and time, you earn a steady supply of resellable goods.

**Numbers Breakdown (Next 100 Customers)**

* Now you‚Äôre handling about 25 items per week, average resale value of $40. That‚Äôs $1,000 gross weekly.
* At 25% commission, you pocket $250 a week = $1,000 a month.
* As your reach grows, so will the volume. The more items you flip, the bigger that pot gets.

 

**Building to $5,000 Per Month in Profit**

Let‚Äôs ramp this up to a legit operation that nets you $5k in profit monthly. Here‚Äôs how:



1. **Hire or Partner Up**
   1. Sorting, photographing, listing, shipping‚Äîit all takes time. Once you‚Äôre handling 50+ items a week, consider bringing on a part-time helper or partner.
2. **Streamline Your Listing Process**
   1. Use inventory management tools like Vendoo, List Perfectly, or eBay‚Äôs bulk listing feature to post items across multiple platforms at once.
3. Niche Down
   1. Certain categories move faster and fetch better prices‚Äîelectronics, brand-new apparel, baby gear, small kitchen appliances, etc.
   2. If you see a trend (e.g., people forgetting to return cookware or smart home devices), become the go-to reseller for that niche.
4. Offer Premium Services
   1. Expand to a house-call service: You‚Äôll come pick up their items, take them away, and handle everything. Charge an extra fee or slightly higher commission for that convenience.
5. Bulk Deals with Repeat Clients
   1. Partner with local real estate agents or apartment complexes. When people move, they often purge items they never returned.
   2. Offer them a special rate if they send multiple items your way, or a flat commission for a large lot.



**Big Picture Math:**

1. 50 items per week at $40 average resale = $2,000 gross each week.
2. At a 25% take, that‚Äôs $500 a week = $2,000/month.
3. Scale to 100 items weekly = $4,000/month. Add premium services or higher-value items, and you‚Äôre knocking on that $5k door.

I need to pick your brain or ask for advice on generic manufacture Camber for adderall XR (not sure if it‚Äôs different for XR vs IR). 

Some back story to help with my confusion: 
I‚Äôm 28f (since I know it affects men/women differently). And it‚Äôs been a minute since I‚Äôve been back on medication. In the 9 months I‚Äôve been back on, I‚Äôve gone through 3 different manufactures and I feel like I‚Äôm going nuts with how inconsistent it is. 

ANI Pharmaceuticals- great, focused all day, had minor heart palpitations (stopped drinking coffee and it went away), and difficult sleeping in the beginning. Other than that, no real issues. I felt like I was ‚Äúnormal‚Äù all day. 

Lannett- didn‚Äôt do anything for me. I‚Äôd take two 25mg XR tabs in the morning on accident and wouldn‚Äôt know the difference. I‚Äôd even take the tabs at 6pm and still easily fall asleep at 9 or 10 pm. It was noticeable to others that my meds weren‚Äôt working. 

Camber- this one is tripping me up. I feel like I can focus, better than Lannett but not as good as ANI Pharm. But the kicker is‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve noticed bloating and hunger?! What the hell?? I have gained 3lbs, feel extra bloated, and my face feels puffy like it‚Äôs getting fat again. I‚Äôve only been on this medication for 5 days. It didn‚Äôt say anything in the paper work or online that lists bloating or weight gain as a side effect. I‚Äôve never experienced this before and it‚Äôs freaking me out. Has anyone ever experienced this with Camber? Am I having a weird adverse reaction and too dumb to realize it?  

TLDR: did anyone experience intense bloating/weight gain and puffy face when starting generic camber for adderal XR? ",1,1736905532.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

Journal of Frater XII of the Esoteric Order of the Other

October 22nd, 1993 - Santa Fe, NM

The Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe. A bastion of normalcy amidst the swirling chaos I've been subjected to. Or so one would hope. I took up a booth with a clear view of the entrance, ostensibly to observe any‚Ä¶ fluctuations. Truthfully, it was to maintain an edge against the gnawing anxiety that had taken root since Siouxsie's (Like ""And The Banshees"", apparently. I been spelling it ""Suzie"" this entire time) frantic call to my show and her equally urgent followups on random payphones. I was still bewildered at how she managed to catch me when I was near them.

I nursed a lukewarm coffee, the taste not entirely dissimilar to burnt plastic, and observed the midday crowd. Tourists mostly, decked out in ludicrous amounts of turquoise. The kind that make locals roll their eyes. Then, my gaze landed on a figure hunched over a mountain of waffles and a truly alarming quantity of crisp bacon. Small frame, completely swallowed by an oversized black hoodie. One might have mistaken it for a child, demolishing a breakfast that would give even the most ardent lumberjack pause.

I waited. Siouxsie was due any minute. This‚Ä¶ child, though, was certainly making a statement. The way the tiny, fabric-covered hands expertly maneuvered a forkful of syrup-drenched waffle into the unseen maw beneath the hood was almost hypnotic. I found myself wondering if this was some new, remarkably efficient method of resource depletion I hadn't encountered. Perhaps a juvenile cryptid with an insatiable sweet tooth? The sheer volume was‚Ä¶ noteworthy.

A cough broke my reverie. A tall woman with tired eyes and a no-nonsense aura stood beside the booth. Dr. Eliza Vance. I straightened, a mild surprise flickering behind my spectacles. Before I could formulate a greeting, a small, fabric-draped hand tugged at Vance‚Äôs sleeve. The hooded figure from the counter.

‚ÄúCount Jim?‚Äù a muffled voice emanated from beneath the black fabric. ‚ÄúTook you long enough. Though you‚Äôre be easy to spot in your getup.‚Äù

My gaze narrowed. The voice was undeniably Siouxsie‚Äôs, albeit slightly distorted by the layers of fabric. I confess, a flicker of‚Ä¶ bewilderment crossed my stoic facade. ‚ÄúSiouxsie?‚Äù I inquired, my voice measured.

This was a turn. I was half expecting Vance to be this mysterious nerve-wracked voice on the phone that's been haunting me. Not this... munchkin.

The hoodie bobbed. ‚ÄúSurprise! Turns out, hitchhiking with a former NAORC scientist is faster than waiting for you to drive all the way from Sisterfuckersville.‚Äù

Former NAORC scientist. Things just keep getting better.

Vance offered a wry smile. ‚ÄúIt's a long drive from Thurber, Siouxsie. Though I admit, the full ‚ÄòCount Jim‚Äô regalia is‚Ä¶ striking in broad daylight.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù the muffled voice agreed. ‚ÄúLike he just stepped off the set of some low-budget vampire Western. You only wear that for the show, right? Please tell me you don‚Äôt grocery shop like this.‚Äù

My hand instinctively went to the brim of my hat. ‚ÄúHey, my outfit is stylish and‚Ä¶ functional. And it serves as a‚Ä¶ recognizable symbol.‚Äù

Siouxsie snorted, a surprisingly loud sound considering her size. ‚ÄúYeah, a symbol of ‚Äòplease ask me about my cable access show.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, you two,‚Äù Vance interjected, a hint of amusement in her tone. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs focus. We have a lot to discuss.‚Äù She slid into the booth opposite me, and with a final, triumphant scrape of a fork against ceramic, Siouxsie, still shrouded in the hoodie, settled beside her.

Vance leaned forward, her expression serious. ‚ÄúSiouxsie is a good acquaintence of mine. She figured you could use my help. I have information, disturbing information, about the NAORC. And about a project they‚Äôre running in collaboration with‚Ä¶ your associates.‚Äù

My jaw tightened. ‚ÄúYes. The EOTO. The NAORC is placing nice with us for the time being.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpecifically,‚Äù Vance continued, her voice dropping, ‚ÄúBoth organizations keeping tabs on the Waxahachie particle accelerator. The guys in charge there are not just smashing atoms, Jim. They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ attempting something far more ambitious. Something involving temporal manipulation. And according to Siouxsie, it‚Äôs not going well.‚Äù

Siouxsie shifted, the fabric of her sleeves rustling. ‚ÄúNot going well is an understatement. Think‚Ä¶ messing with things that should not be messed with. And guess who‚Äôs right in the middle of it?‚Äù

The weight of her words settled heavily in the air. The burnt plastic taste of the coffee seemed to intensify.

Suddenly, the bell above the diner door chimed, announcing new arrivals. Two men, both broad-shouldered and possessing that unsettlingly vacant gaze I‚Äôd become familiar with in my tenure with the EOTO. NAORC operatives.

‚ÄúCompany,‚Äù I stated, my voice low.

Siouxsie stiffened beside me. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ looking for someone small. And probably someone who smells faintly of waffle batter.‚Äù

‚ÄúTime to go,‚Äù Vance said, already sliding out of the booth.

As I rose, I felt a tug on my coat. Siouxsie. ‚ÄúHold tight,‚Äù she whispered, her voice no longer muffled.

Before I could react, she moved. A blur of black fabric, faster than anything I could have anticipated. One moment she was beside me, the next she was halfway to the exit, weaving through tables with an impossible agility. The pursuing men, momentarily stunned by her speed, stumbled over a discarded tray.

And then, something truly remarkable happened. As she reached the door, a ripple seemed to distort the air around her. For a split second, she wasn‚Äôt quite‚Ä¶ there. More like a flicker on a faulty television screen. Then she was gone, the door swinging shut behind her.

Vance and I exchanged a look. Even through my red-tinted lenses, I could see the shock mirrored in her eyes. Something was undeniably‚Ä¶ different about Siouxsie.

We made our escape through the back exit, less dramatically but no less urgently. Siouxsie was already waiting in the alley, leaning against a dumpster, the oversized hoodie still concealing her features.

‚ÄúShow off,‚Äù I muttered, though a grudging respect was beginning to form.

‚ÄúHad to make an impression,‚Äù she replied, a hint of that sly wit I‚Äôd heard in her voice earlier. A far cry from her tense anxious pleas over the phone.

A decommissioned NAORC facility outside of Los Alamos became our next destination. Maybe we could find something of use there. Vance worked there in the past and knew its layout; Siouxsie possessed‚Ä¶ abilities of some sort apparantely. And I, well, I had... vague... experience with the unpleasant things NAORC liked to keep hidden.

But that can wait till tomorrow. I was overdue for a nap and a shower. We headed to the crappy motel I booked.

Later, while Siouxsie was boredly flipping throught he channels on the motel TV while demolishing an entire pizza, Vance was out getting supplies, and I was sound asleep in a chair, the satellite link on my laptop pinged and woke me up from my slumber. A text message from an anonymous Count Jim BBS user. The words were simple, chillingly so: \[The Red Inquisitioner knows\]. Inquisitor. It has to be the scary dude in the pointy hood.

1. Glitch, a fan favorite for a reason. Fantastic coffee, expertly made. It is a luxury item, and the price definitely reflects that. You also get to experience Tokyo's favorite past time, queueing lol.

2. This was a hidden gem I'm stumbled upon in the Jingumae area. Koffee Mameya. Wonderful staff, with a huge variety of beans to choose from, you can sample anything from light giesha all the way down to some really funky dark roasts. Bonus points if you stop at Fukuyoshi for the best tonkatsu of your life.

3. Apollon Gold. Fairly non descript, small shop with limited seating. Coffee was great but overall the experience was pretty basic. 

4. √Ü Ash. This was recommended to me by the roasters at Koffee Mameya. Excellent flat white, and their goal is to eliminate waste. I had a coffee cherry canal√© that was incredible!

5. This was actually at my hotel bar, but I had seen a few of these siphon coffee machines throughout the city and wanted to give it a try on my last day. Was surprisingly good, functions similarly to a moka pot. Best hotel coffee I've ever had, that's for sure. 

6. Coffee vending machines are on, almost literally, every corner. They offer cold or hot, and are very delicious, especially in a pinch. Just make sure to take your trash with you. 

Overall the coffee experience in Tokyo certainly lives up the hype. The only downside was visiting Peru before this, where the coffee is just as good, and for a fraction of the price. ",17,1736904853.0,pourover,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôve noticed that my pupils are currently different in size. The difference is slight but noticeable. They react normally to light, shrinking evenly, but the size difference is apparent in regular lighting and darkness.

Today, I drank coffee, used several skincare products on my face/around my eyes, took a Canesten vaginal pill, applied Canesten external cream, and used my Alvesco inhaler for asthma.

2 weeks ago, I experienced headaches for about 7-8 days, occurring a few hours each day. It started a little before my period and stopped 2-3 days after it. I haven‚Äôt had any headaches for the past two weeks. Over the past month, I‚Äôve also felt nauseous 4-5 times, mostly in the mornings, usually due to stress or hunger.

What could be causing this? Should I seek medical attention, or should I just monitor for any other symptoms or changes?

Last Flight
by William Presler
It seems Jimmy has slipped the surly bonds of earth one last time.

 

I always called him Uncle Jim, but in my mind he was either Jimmy, because my Grandmother called him that, or Jim & Mitzi (with an ampersand not a full ‚Äúand‚Äù) because where there was one of them, the other wouldn‚Äôt be far behind.

 

That ‚Äúslipping the surly bonds‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt some poetic turn of phrase that I came up with. It comes from a famous poem about aviation called ‚ÄúHigh Flight.‚Äù Every aviator knows it, many by heart.

 

It touches me and my soul, this poem, because I too am a pilot. Mostly because of Jimmy I suppose. When I was a kid, he regaled me with stories of what it was like to fly. To learn to fly. To take off. To be able to navigate across these United States with a map and a compass and a good bit of derring-do and, perhaps, a bit of intelligence. Everyone knew Jimmy was smart. I was just a kid in KY who just sort of got through high school classes, sometimes barely. But he always encouraged me.

 

I learned a few other things from Jim & Mitzi. Just being around them was so interesting and exotic. Dark dark dark coffee with something called chicory in it, made like a chemist would make it. Later the introduction to the nicer side of New Orleans. Mitzi gave me my first kiwi. The fruit, not a person from Down Under. But it was all so interesting and far more cultured than my whereabouts at that time.

 

When I was in my twenties, perhaps still in college or maybe just out of it, he offered again to give me some books on learning to fly. I accepted gladly and then sat down to soak them all in. The symbologies and terminologies and equations galore‚Ä¶ and I said to myself, ‚Äúwow‚Ä¶this looks hard.‚Äù

 

Later, the gentle tick tock sound of my own mortality started to become more audible to my ears and I realized that if I was going to learn to fly, I would have to get started, and so I did and never stopped and I‚Äôm still learning. I‚Äôm on a flight now as I write this, to Denver where tomorrow I will begin training on a new type of plane. I‚Äôve flown lots of different types of planes, in different places and countries and I‚Äôve gotten to do some cool things. I own an aviation business or two and get to do all sorts of fun stuff. Like build a plane.  Then fly a plane that I had built. But that‚Äôs not the same. What I did was hard. But what he did was impossible.

 

He built his first P-38 when he was 14, of balsa wood. He always loved that plane. Always. He always wanted to fly. Always. He joined the military to fly. But he was color blind, and he could not be a military aviator, at all. He thought this meant he could never be a pilot. But Jimmy was in love with how flight could work. He loved the art of it. Like a master musician loves the way math and music fall in line once you reach a certain understanding. He had that understanding. I don‚Äôt. As he believed he couldn‚Äôt be a pilot, he pursued a career in aviation, at a level of understanding that is hard to even comprehend, for me at least.

 

At 65, or thereabouts, retired from a long tenure as Professor of Aeronautical Engineering, he finally learned to fly. Somehow he was talking to someone about how he had always wanted to be a pilot but couldn‚Äôt do it because he was color blind. They informed him, that though it may be true that you can‚Äôt be a military aviator without color vision, it really didn‚Äôt matter at all for civilian or general aviation when it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot for commercial purposes.‚Äù

 

So he learned to fly. In his 60‚Äôs. That‚Äôs hard at any age. Then he got his instrument rating. Which is many times more difficult. He said that one hour of instrument instruction was for him like digging a ditch for eight hours straight. Or so it felt. I‚Äôm not sure if he had experienced digging ditches for 8 hours. I didn‚Äôt think to ask‚Ä¶

 

In the midst of all this, he decided he wanted to build a plane. He wanted to build a replica of a P-38, this famed and celebrated ‚ÄúWar Bird‚Äù that he loved so much. His friends of the aviator ilk‚Ä¶and he had so many‚Ä¶(Jim & Mitzi were loved by people in the world of flying and especially in the ‚ÄúMeyers Aircraft Owner‚Äôs Association‚Äù literally all over the country)‚Ä¶they tried to talk him out of it. To build something from a kit (like I did) is what they said he should do. He wanted none of it.

 

Anyway, the great minds at Lockheed, later to be called Lockheed Martin, said that it couldn‚Äôt be done by an individual. It was not possible. That‚Äôs what they said about it. The builders of the ‚ÄúLockheed P-38 Lightning‚Äù said it could not be done. So I don‚Äôt need to say a lot more I suppose about how what he did, literally, was thought to be impossible. Jimmy, apparently, didn‚Äôt care. So he built a plane that wasn‚Äôt possible to build. Two Thirds scale. The world's only TTP38.

 

He made a few modifications, like creating a little seat behind his seat where Mitz could sit. The original plane only sported a pilot, no passengers. But if Jim went somewhere, there would be an ‚Äú& Mitzi.‚Äù Adorable.

 

Anyway, as one pilot to another, much later I asked him about it. He had just finished some major modifications. I asked him about building it of course, but really, how do you fly something so complicated when there is no ‚ÄúPilot Operating Handbook‚Äù or POH, no ‚ÄúOperating Limits‚Äù clearly placarded. No Checklists nor Procedures. No nothing. Except his clear and penetrating insight into the very nature of flight itself.  I don‚Äôt know what else to say‚Ä¶somehow‚Ä¶he could just see it. All of it. Laid out in front of him, like a Master Chess Player sees the board as it is and dozens of moves out with permutations and complications. Or the way a great baseball hitter can see the seams on the ball as it barrels towards him at 90 miles per hour. I don‚Äôt know how to tell you this, but he could just see it. I know this. I saw it in his eyes.

 

About the building of it, he said that he just worked on it and kept working on it. He said that he had decided he would keep at it until he came to an equation or problem that he couldn‚Äôt figure out. Apparently that never happened. For 25 plus years, he worked on it. Calculations, building‚Ä¶things that teams of engineers and technicians and assemblers would have done. He did it. It isn‚Äôt really possible to describe it. At least I don‚Äôt know how. I‚Äôve looked over some of the drawings, the photos, the work itself. The rigging he built. His first drafts in wood that he would later cut in metal. It‚Äôs too much. How one person did this, even with Mitzi‚Äôs ever patient help, I do not know.

 

He said he would dedicate 25 years to building it, and if he was lucky, he would live long enough to fly it.

 

So he flew it‚Ä¶his dream‚Ä¶his opus, master work, or whatever you want to say. Not everyone gets to fly, few have a passion for airplanes and flight and flying and the underlying symmetry of mathematics and physics and the sheer beauty of it all‚Ä¶not the way that Jimmy did. Only a handful of people accomplish that which the world says is not possible. And he did it without fanfare or interest in fame. Literally every magazine in the world of aviation would have given anything to have that story. The Experimental Aircraft Association would have his story enshrined in the halls of Oshkosh, by gosh. But Jimmy just wanted to build his plane. That‚Äôs all. Because he loved it.

 

I‚Äôm glad for him, and for me, for the passion he had and shared and fostered. And that Jim & Mitzi got to have such an amazing adventure together.

 

And so he has slipped the surly bonds one last time. I suspect Mitzi won‚Äôt be too far behind. She never was. They were always so lovely together.

 

And if they do one last thing together, I would like to think it will be to put out their hands and touch the face of God, in High Flight. Forever, or just one last time.

Thus, missing TS's Genius!","Playing my own devil's advocate here for the people who like to check comment history lol.

These aren't terrible tropes. These aren't right-wing propaganda points. The characters aren't caricatures. These show is not trying to pander to the CONSERVATIVE audience at all. In fact, this show is super progressive, hidden under the guise of the former to dupe the ""target"" audience into seeing a broader perspective.

**The Teenage Situation:**

It's not gross or pervy that a large part of the story focuses on teenage sex. It's a critique on how conservatives are demonizing it. Tommy and Angela are progressive. They understand that sex is a part of life, as indicated by their own backstory. They know that Aynsley and Quarterback guy are going to have sex one way or another, so they would rather have them having sex in save space where the know it's consensual; promoting the notion that sex shouldn't be something that is a sin or inherently bad, but human nature that you should not be ashamed of or hide. 

It sends a message to men, and more specifically GenZ: it isn't about body count. Young women should not be slut shamed, and young men aren't emasculated just because they want to have a compassionate relationship where they connect on a deeper level and develop intimacy, not only sexually, but emotionally with their partner. This is okay! (As depicted in the final bedroom scene between QB and Aynsley vs the Stark contrast of the First dumbass QB). 

The strip club highlighted that sexuality should be enjoyed! No stigma of strippers (sex workers) being the gutter of society, but projected as actual mature adults making mature decisions and being comfortable with oneself. QB overcomes his insecurities in this moment, and breaks through societal stigmas and norms, recognizing that it isn't ""gay"" or ""wrong"" but simply just, fun. 

We see the boomers enjoying what they realized they had repressed their whole life, and living in the moment, for the moment.

**The Company or Family:**

Essentially, work-life balance. You can chase money your whole life (Tommy) and never achieve it. You might actually get there (Monty), but in the end you die. How do you want to be remembered? The father who cared about his family or the father who put business first, and as a result, died never seeing his own kids for the last time; never having a relationship deeper than, ""you want a cup of coffee"" (or whatever) with your own spouse. 

This was the whole point of the Cowboys Owner (don't know the name cause don't give a shit) giving his little family spiel. 

**The Widow:**

Taylor allows us to battle our own internal frustrations with Ariana. The character highlights the discord we have within ourselves; challenging out own morals and values in the sanctity of marriage, loss, and relationships. Everyone grieves differently; how Ariana chooses to grieve and how fast she recovers from her own loss is unique to her. 

She too, has a life, a life she has to continue living. Who is to decide what that looks like for her? We hate it because it's too soon? We hate it because it's drawn out? We hate it because of who she is with? It allows us to reflect on our reactions, recognize the stigma and negativity we put on others, even in the face of extreme loss and hardship. We fail to recognize the pain and suffering another individual experiences, and instead, criticize it to avoid our own discomforts.

**What makes a Man?**

Tommy. What we know and what we see in Tommy is a culmination of how he is projected through the themes in the show, and critique of what it really means to be a ""Man."" Tommy is not a trope (Rick in Yellowstone or any of the men in that show actually... even TS himself) but a loyal; compassionate, emotional yet rational; empathetic; human being. 

No womanizing, but in fact still has love for his wife, regardless of her decision to leave when things got rough. He owns his impact; noting and reflecting on his contributions for a failed marriage, without resentment. 

His love for his daughter, as naive as she may be, and even though it goes against his wishes, accepts reality and continues to support in a healthy way. 

He supports Cooper in the same way, instead of berating or tearing him down to make him ""tough,"" he encourages him to follow his dreams and ambitions. Tommy gives advice, yet allows space for a conversation about the risks, in a way for Cooper to make his own decisions. This allows for Cooper to establish growth and his own independence in a healthy way. 

Most importantly; he shows that he is vulnerable. He establishes to the audience that he has weaknesses, habits, some he has overcome and some that he still battles. Yet, he continues to challenge the ambivalence he has within himself, a continued attempt and being better than he was before no matter the obstacles the show throws at him. 

*Cooper, Cami, and Rebecca's themes are still underdeveloped so I didn't write about them. Also, the cartel conflict is pretty straight forward.*

In the past, he has mentioned that he does not like ‚Äúwaking up alone‚Äù/ without me. This came about because I used to move to the living room when he or our pets would take up too much space in the bed or disturb my sleep too much in a single night.

Last night, I went to bed and felt so restless and at one point even got SUPER hot. So, I got up and left to lay on the couch. Around 4 am, I could hear him get up to use the bathroom then walk over to the living room. I was still tired enough to remain sleeping so I didn‚Äôt force myself to wake fully at the time. Eventually he walked away and I figured that was that. Now, he usually wakes me up at 5 am so I can make his lunch. He didn‚Äôt do that and when i eventually did wake, I saw it was almost 6 am. I instantly knew something was, so I got up and walked over to him in the bedroom. The conversation is as follows:

Me: ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt going to wake me up?‚Äù
Husband: ‚ÄúNo. You were sleeping.‚Äù

He said it so monotone and I knew he was mad. So I walked out of the room and continued with my morning routine (packing his lunch, making his coffee, tending to the animals, etc). Once I was done, I layed down on the bed and went on my phone (something I also usually do). As I layed there, I heard him in our hallway getting his shoes and coat on‚Ä¶ then he said from the hallway ‚ÄúBye, OP. I‚Äôm leaving‚Äù then was about to leave but then I noticed his phone was still by me so I quickly I grabbed it and set it on the counter next to him so he wouldn‚Äôt forget it. He saw I didn‚Äôt hand it to him, so he looked at me and said ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your problem now?‚Äù. At this point, I‚Äôm over it all and just replied ‚ÄúNothing‚Äù. I followed him to our door (I do this every morning and he gives me a kiss). He left out the door and said bye, but no kiss. Shortly after, he texted me saying ‚ÄúOf course we left on bad terms. What a great day.‚Äù I don‚Äôt reply back at all, I needed space and I assume he did too.

All of these details is to say‚Ä¶ I knew he was mad. Seeing as this isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, I want to have a productive conversation to figure out what I am doing wrong or vice versa. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

1i1luq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1i1luq3/the_best_possible_timeline/,The Best Possible Timeline,"It started as a silly experiment.

I heard it in a video‚Äîa woman claimed her life changed by saying one phrase before bed for three nights: ‚ÄúI intend to wake up in my best possible timeline.‚Äù She swore it fixed everything‚Äîher career, relationships, even her health. I was desperate. My life was awful: a job I hated, a crumbling apartment, and no real friends to turn to. What did I have to lose?

Night one, nothing happened. The apartment was still dingy, the sink still leaked, and my boss still glared at me all day.

Night two was different. Things felt easier. The bus I always missed waited for me. My boss didn‚Äôt yell, and the persistent ache in my lower back? Gone. I went to bed with hope.

By night three, I whispered the words like a prayer.

When I woke up, sunlight poured through the windows of a spotless apartment. My chipped coffee table was replaced with sleek marble. The scratch on the wall where I‚Äôd banged a chair was gone. Even the air smelled cleaner. Like lavender and fresh linen. My phone buzzed endlessly with messages from names I didn‚Äôt recognize. Compliments, invitations, people thanking me for being part of their life. Everything was perfect.

By day two, things started to glitch.

I saw my reflection in the office window. At first, I thought it was a trick of the light, but no. My reflection didn‚Äôt match my movements. When I stopped walking, it kept going for a few seconds before snapping back into place. Later, it smiled at me when I wasn‚Äôt smiling.

That night, I locked my doors and covered every mirror in my apartment. I tried to convince myself it was just my imagination, but even with the mirrors covered, I felt watched. When I closed my eyes, it was there. A prickle on the back of my neck, the faint sound of breathing that wasn‚Äôt mine.

On the third day, people started acting strange. My coworker Sarah, who barely knew me before, hugged me so tightly I could feel her nails digging into my back. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre finally here,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for so long.‚Äù At lunch, my boss handed me a folder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs everything you‚Äôve ever asked for,‚Äù he said, his smile too wide. I didn‚Äôt open it. The way he looked at me made my stomach twist.

When I got home, the air felt wrong. Stagnant. A faint smell of decay lingered in the rooms. I uncovered the bathroom mirror, and my reflection was gone.

I turned, and there it was‚Äîstanding behind me. It looked just like me, but its smile was too sharp, its eyes hollow and dark.

‚ÄúThis is the best possible timeline,‚Äù it said in my voice. ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt belong in it.‚Äù

Its hands, my hands, reached for my throat. As I gasped for air, the last thing I heard was its whisper: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll take it from here.‚Äù",17,1736903496.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1i1lu0f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1i1lu0f,Takayama (*) Kyoto,"Started off our honeymoon with our first fine dining meal of the trip in Kyoto at Creative Dining Takayama. I made resos when they first opened two months ahead on Tablecheck and it was fairly easy to get a table even over Christmas-New years holidays.

The restaurant is located in the same building and floor as Velrosier and only has counter seating for 12, seated from left to right based on time of arrival. Our time slot had 2 families of four and two couples including us with all foreigners and the majority of guests from the U.S. and Canada.

Onto the meal, everyone had a choice for a welcome drink between champagne or a non-alcoholic drink that was included. Also skipped lunch at the recommendation of another redditor on this subreddit and reading other reviews (which was a godsend because we still didnt end up finishing).

QR code: An aesthetic start to the meal, the QR code contained the a link to their instagram which had the menu of the day. Afterwards, it was to be consumed in one bite. With an exterior of white chocolate and sweet/tart juice inside, this was something so simple yet executed well. My husband chose this as his favourite!

Caviar: Personally indifferent to caviar but the crunchiness of the squid ink chip was interesting.

Foie Gras: Plated with seasonal flowers, the foie gras was moulded into two tiny ducks which was a fun touch.

Cracker: Didn‚Äôt like this one. The burnt taste from stamping a smiley face overwhelmed any other flavour I could taste.

Starters (From clockwise): Tomato sauce with spam¬ø, soup, and slightly spicy cured meat with arancini. This was alright.

Cold Appetizers (First five, L to R): Rice cracker with finger lime, prosciutto, salted ice cream, fresh sashimi, and a salted egg yolk cake. I enjoyed the textural and taste profile differences between every dish.

Hot Appetizers (Last five, L to R): Oyster tempura with mini crab cutouts from carrots or beets, tomato with microgreens, corn soup, fish w/ pesto sauce, mini fish bun with homemade tartar sauce. 

Fish: I typically dont enjoy eating fish but the cook on this was perfection and the various powders and sauces elevated the dish. This was paired with baked root vegetables.

A4 Beef: Chef personally explained that they utilize the mother cow rather than the baby which is more humane and would previously be considered as an unwanted. Having had A5 on previous occasions, i prefer a leaner cut which provides the fatty taste profile without being overly rich after several bites.

White truffles: These were in season and were used in the upcoming pasta dish.

Pasta: I was thankful the portions were becoming smaller at this point. Simple but delicious. Chef also personally shaved the truffles for everyone individually.

Crab: We were also fortunate that we were able to catch the tail end of snow crab season. The risotto was creamy and decadent underneath.

Mini desserts (L to R): Calamansi or some other type of citrus juice, finger lime shaved ice, mochi, strawberry pudding¬ø, homemade milk icecream with  crunchy topping. I loved how tart and cold these mini desserts were. The shaved ice was so refreshing after having copious amounts of food.

Main dessert: Kumquat topped with something i would categorize as between whipped cream and icecream alongside crumbled meringue.

Petit four: We were so stuffed at this point and chef recommended us to eat four and pack the rest. 

Side dessert: A cute strawberry tart with dried flowers we got to take home. Every group received one but ours said Auguri which means congratulations, for our honeymoon. 

Tea or coffee was offered at the end.

Final thoughts: I knew going into this meal that it was going to be lengthy and an abundance of food but my husband and I really enjoyed this meal. I also appreciated the sentiment that chef spent some time living abroad in Italy and due to his memories of italian meals feeding you till you were full; he wanted to share that same process in his restaurant.

Moreover, the servers were extremely talkative which aided in cultivating a comfortable ambiance with guests sharing where they were from, other fine dining establishments they‚Äôve booked for their trip, and favourite dishes of the meal.

I feel like the gang definitely would've done something shady behind the teachers' backs, and you can see them scheming in the hallway when the teachers confront them. We'll likely get to see what they were talking about.

Another weird theory I have is maybe Mac did something shady with Ava's car, and possibly bought the cinnamon rolls to cover up some kind of smell it left behind?? I can also imagine the scene where Mac shows up right in front of Ava holding her coffee being a distraction for something going on behind him?? It's a reach, but I'd love to see something dumb like that happen.

Maybe Charlie learning to read was also a distraction, seeing as it occupied 3 different teachers at once...

My baby is 6 weeks old today and this experience thus far has been brutal. Ever since my baby has been 3 weeks of age he has been crying constantly anytime he is awake. Before every feeding (which is understandable - he is hungry), during the feeding and after the feeding. I will burp him and while he will burp he continues to cry. I‚Äôve tried different burping techniques. I‚Äôve tried feeding him an ounce and then burp. I‚Äôve done bicycles and belly rubs and while gas will be passed he still cries. I‚Äôve tried different feeding positions and I‚Äôve tried different bottles. He is mainly fed breastmilk via breast and bottle. It does not matter if it is on breast or bottle. I‚Äôve tried feeding, changing the diaper, offering a pacifier, swinging, rocking and bouncing. Skin to skin, cuddling, tummy rubs. He does seem to like baths/showers. I‚Äôve tried gas drops. I recently (like today) just purchased hypoallergic formula from enfamil. The formulas I have supplemented with (enfamil yellow and the gentleease), I purchased gripe water (although there is little research to back it up that it helps) but I couldn‚Äôt give it to him bc it said not to give to a crying baby or mix with formula/breastmilk. I am currently removing dairy from my diet. I am also ordering probiotics for him. As of recent (last week) he went an entire week without pooping. While I understand that most breastmilk fed babies poop less something in my mom gut told me something was off. I bought the Frida windi and when I used it he pooped‚Ä¶and a lot of poop came out. I‚Äôve been in contact with his pediatrician. She is advising to remove dairy from my diet. 

I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I feel so sad seeing him in pain my heart breaks. He looks so sad. I cannot stop crying. I am of course sleep deprived and just feel like this is breaking me. I want to embrace this newborn stage but I can‚Äôt. Today I put him in his bassinet while he cried and I took a time out in the bathroom and I cried. I cried the ugliest and heaviest cry. I tugged at my hair, too. I am frustration and I thought I was doing great. I made it to 6 weeks breastfeeding and with my first I only (barely) made it to 4. I thought I was doing so good. Eating healthy. I haven‚Äôt had take out. Cookies. Chips. Or any junk of any kind. I am not drinking any coffee although my mom just bought me a new coffee machine because I don‚Äôt want anything else to contribute to his discomfort. 

I want to throw the towel in. I know I‚Äôm not a bad mom. I put him down to cry when I need to walk away. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him. I feel bad for him. Basically if he is awake‚Ä¶he is miserable and I want to give up. ",5,1736903280.0,Mommit,3,0.86,False

""Be skeptical of everything you think. Choose thoughts/actions based on values."" ","I have Aspergers and ADD and Depression. I want to be social, but I cut myself off from people a lot because I worry about making them uncomfortable based on years of social faux pas. 

My therapist appears to be Buddhist influenced as they promote mindfulness and meditation and talk about Buddhist principles. I have never understood mindfulness as every description is too vague. I don't get what they mean by ""Be skeptical of everything you think. Choose thoughts/actions based on values"" and we had an argument/debate about it (most of our sessions are arguments/debates but today felt like the most irritated they have been so far). Like, how literal do they mean with 'be skeptical of EVERYTHING you think'? There's no built in limitation to that so if I took that literally I'd be paralyzed and doubt EVERYTHING I think about stuff. I brought up that would include my name or if I was hungry, and they agreed that yes, that would include it. I told them that sounds just silly then.

When we talked about meditation they said I should make space for feelings during that time, which didn't make any sense to me until they gave kinda a demonstration. Apparently they wanted me to treat 'make space' as almost a koan, with them telling me that, and then me coming back to them with what I think it means. ""Like a buddhist master asking someone why a dog moos."" I didn't get that at all. 

I want to be happy and get better, but most of my sessions are just me dissecting what they say and seeing if it makes sense to me and is something I feel I could do without messing up. So far, nope. Last session was a lot of them telling me ""It's okay to introduce yourself to women and ask them out for coffee."" I agreed it was okay, just not for me due to my Aspergers and such and my fears of messing that up. I've been seeing them for 8 months now and I don't feel I've made any progress. Sigh.

Since learning about both I wondered what it would take to use both to get my food for the day. Fries for every meal doesn't sound great but the Irish lived off just potatoes so...

I made [this map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1d-HV9a7tWvu49Z0Nfm9HfXDbIWd03YU&usp=sharing) which shows Panera locations in green and Sheetz locations in Blue. Each Panera also has its nearest Sheetz location listed. This map is for all the states which have Sheetz stations.  


Some locations of the two chains are practically in the same parking lot. Others a few miles apart.  
  
  
The Panera drinks subscription is $15/month (though they often give away free months) and comes with a free drink every 2 hours that then has unlimited refills. This can be coffee, tea, soda, or any drink on tap. There are also surprise discounts on food.

The sheetz fries subscription is $10/month and is also redeemable every 2 hours. According to other redditors, condiments/dipping sauces are also free and you can get reward points for redeeming your free bag of fries to then redeem those points for other foods/coupons.   
  
Each bag of fries is \~300-400 calories. In a 10 hour period that can be 2000 calories not counting the drinks.

Either search for your Local Sheetz, Local Panera, or your town name and the map will show your options.   
Lets join the two food subscriptions to get a nice supply of fries and drinks for a great price.

It may sound dystopian to you for me to suggest using this as a consistent source of food but the math works. If you use this, great. If you don't, that's cool too. Hope this helps somebody.

'ppreciate y'all. Thanks!

While doing this, I noticed a Delta captain in uniform come in and sit down with his drink at a table near mine. Well, here I am filling out applications, might as well get some hiring news straight from the horse's mouth, so I go over and start talking to him. I ask if he knows if Delta is hiring and I tell him that I'm a regional airline pilot. He doesn't seem to hear that last bit, and tells me that if I study hard and apply myself that I, too, can be an airline pilot like him. Oooookay, he's a lil deaf, so I tell him that, no, I'm already a pilot, I fly for Air Wisconsin. He kinda gives me a blank look, like he's never heard of air wisk*yahn*sin, and then just says that yeah, if I'm willing to fly international that I'll be hired quickly because nobody else wants to do it because their girlfriends get jealous. This surprised me, not just because of the unbidden and weird advice for my love life but also that Delta was easy to get into. I said wow, I sure will sir! He goes on to mention that flying charter for the vikings was interesting but they are rude to the other passengers, which should have been another warning sign because an NFL team sure as shit doesn't fly with other passengers. I finally twig to something being wrong when he says ""flying international is interesting when they refuel you in flight.""

""...Delta refuels in flight?""

""Yeah, the military does it all the time...""

""I knew that, but you're saying that DELTA airlines refuels its international flights MIDAIR?""

""Oh yeah, they do for the long flights. Especially for countries that don't really get along with the U.S.""

At this point I'm taking a good look at his uniform. He has a pilot shirt, I recognize the brand, his epaulets seem kosher, he's wearing a lanyard with what looks like a Delta card in it, he's even got a little gold Delta pin in his tie. HOWEVER, I just now realize that his wings above his left pocket are THE PLASTIC WINGS YOU HAND OUT TO KIDS ON AN AIRPLANE.

1i1lls8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lenormand/comments/1i1lls8/how_to_read_yesno_in_the_lenormand/,How to Read YES/NO in the Lenormand,"Hello, everyone,

I see a lot of readers here pulling a lot of cards for yes/no questions and, of course, confusing themselves because of the sheer abundance of (often contradictory) cards for what is supposed to be a simple answer. Yes, you can do yes/no with 5 cards, BUT the caveat is that the first 2 cards need to connect to your context in some way; e.g., asking about if your car will get fixed by Monday, and the first 2 cards are Clouds + Ship, affirming the context that your car has a pressure issue (Clouds = pressure build-up + Ship = vehicle); or asking about if you will get back together with your ex-partner and the first 2 cards being Heart + Scythe to affirm that there was a breakup (Heart = relationship + Scythe = breakup, separation). Again, the first 2 cards *need* to connect to the context in some way. You actually answer the yes/no with the rest of the cards as long as one or more is a strong positive or negative card to answer yes or no, respectively; e.g., asking if you will get a raise at work and the last 3 cards being Sun + Fish + Tower = yes, you will succeed in getting a raise (Sun = success, victory + Fish = raise, abundance + Tower = in your office/corporate/company job); or asking if your missing cat is still alive and the last 3 cards being the Dog (the cat) + Stork + Moon (two positive cards that say yes, that cat is still alive).

Now, I make yes/no very very simple, personally, by pulling only one or 2 cards, depending on what I feel in that moment, and I read those cards, as long as they are strong positive or negative, to answer yes or no, respectively. For example, I once asked if my best friend would get a job with Disney when he had applied for one, and I pulled Rider + Clouds, which is literally like *""the answer/feedback is...""* \+ *""... no,""* and he did not get that Disney job. He then wanted to get a job with a certain coffee shop, so I pulled to see if he would, and I pulled Stars + Bear, which is a yes because of the Stars, and he did end up getting that job. If you pull all positive, it is obviously a yes, and if you pull all negative, it is obviously a no. If you pull all neutral, it is not answering either way, and then you need to maybe ask another question or ask that question in a different way, or you need to actually focus better on that question because your focus was off that time, and the cards don't answer accurately sometimes when your focus is off. If you pull all neutral multiple times in a row, that is the cards' way of telling me that there isn't an answer to give yet, like maybe something is still being worked out about that situation, so there is no definitive answer yet. This you need to feel out, though, to see if it actually is that, which you learn to do with a lot of practice and experience.

Sometimes you actually pull positive and negative together, and then a few factors affect that answer:

1. The order of the cards;
2. The *context*; and
3. The specific positive and negative cards that came up.

For example, from Rana George's *The Essential Lenormand*,

""Is Michael's plan to get his kids back from his estranged ex-wife a good plan?""  
Fox + Ring = yes, his devious plan will be able to reunite them.

""Is Ryan good for Patricia?""  
Fox + Ring = no, he is using treachery to trap her.

It is the same cards for each reading, but under different *contexts,* it changes the answer and which card has the stronger influence based on its positive or negative orientation. For the first reading, it is a yes because the Fox is only affirming the context of Michael's devious plan, so you really only have the Ring to answer it, and the Ring is positive. In the second reading, it is a no because under a relationship context about if someone is good for you as a partner, the Fox is especially negative and strong because it is someone who is a liar and manipulator and who doesn't have good, honest intentions pretty much despite the Ring's positive orientation. Do you see how the different contexts changed it each time so that they would say different things for each reading? Your context context context is very important for yes/no this way because it is going to tell you, in the case of positive and negative showing up, which is the stronger card in that context. Always always always go back to your *context* to make sure you are interpreting those cards correctly for the one question you asked.

Let's practice yes/no pulls in this thread. Post your yes/no pulls using this method, and I will help out/guide where needed. Also, if you have any questions, as always, drop them below.",6,1736902769.0,Lenormand,7,1.0,False
1i1llme,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1i1llme/did_i_make_the_wrong_choice_euthanizing_my_dog/,Did I make the wrong choice Euthanizing my Dog ,"My dog was 14.5 years old and normally very healthy aside from some back pain that was on and off. He could still see, walk, eat and play almost like a young dog... until one night things took a shift for the worse out of nowhere. 

The day started like normal, I took him out to our local coffee shop and he waited outside for me until I came back from ordering, walking away from the coffee shop he was happy and prancing and begging for a piece of my pastry as usual. We spent the rest of the of the day at home suiting in the couch relaxing and I just noticed he seemed a little off so I went to get up to take him outside and he SPRINTED to the door and then outside and had diarrhea. I thought that it was weird but brushed it off to a minor upset stomach and we continued the day but I could tell he still didn't feel well. That night he had a 2nd minor accident of diarrhea in the living and we didn't get mad we just cleaned it up said he was ok and went to dinner. 

After dinner we came back and he clearly wasn't feeling well still and didn't want to move or anything. This is where I started to get panicky but my boyfriend assured me he just has an upset stomach he'll be ok let him rest.

So we did he played in his bed right next to ours and a few minutes go by and my boyfriend SHOOTS out of bed to get to the dog. He had apparently sat up looked at my bf and fell over. I was terrified we looked at his gums and they were ghost white so we rushed him to the emergency vet thinking he ate something poisonous.

This is where it gets worse. After looking him over and an ultrasound the vet comes back to tell me that he has a growth on his spleen and apparent internal bleeding. My heart shattered, we stayed for awhile and they got him semi stable and told us that they would need a second ultrasound in the morning to determine the severity but had also told us about a surgery to remove his spleen to send it to biopsy to see if it was cancer (they seemed certain that it was but weren't allowed to confirm without biopsy). We agreed and he stayed in the EV overnight and received the 2nd ultrasound which then revealed not only one but two lesions on his spleen, one of which was quite large and his body could no longer stop the bleeding on its own. He would need another blood transfusion and operation to drain his abdomen of the blood surgery to remove his spleen and if confirmed chemotherapy to prolong or put off the spread of this cancer. However, the vet informed me that even with the spleen surgery, the chemo and everything it would only buy him six months longer. At the most. In total, all of this would cost us around $12,000. Again the vet could not fully confirm that this was cancer without a biopsy, but my boyfriend and I asked as many questions as we could googled as much as we could research as much as we could and it came back that he had a one and three chance of it being benign, and that chance got smaller the more lesions there were and the more bleeding there was. 

I was devastated crying couldn't accept it losing my mind in the end we decided that we were just going to euthanize him and I didn't want to at all. It seemed like he would go through all of those operations, a major surgery and chemo. It seemed like he would just be miserable for his next six months and his final six months and they said that if it was cancer, it would come back because it was cancer of the bone marrow and the blood, and not the spleen and when it came back, it would come back on a different organ, like the heart or the lungs

I feel so guilty though having euthanized him because when we were in the room saying goodbye, he was up walking around eating. He was some shadow of his normal self that it was obvious that he wasn't feeling good because he didn't want Toys or french fries. But he did seem very alive moving around walking around looking at me interacting with me like he did. It felt like he had so much more life to live and I'm feeling miserable and guilty that we put him down when I could've given him six more months. 

Family and friends have tried to reassure me that I did the right thing because those last six months would've been been suffering as chemo makes dogs, miserable, and sick as well as a major surgery removing an organ wouldn't be easy to recover from.

I don't know. I'm still just feeling so guilty like I murdered my dog. Did I do the wrong thing?

I‚Äôll try to keep this brief but I (M 28) feel like the backstory is important. My friend (F 27) and I have gotten very close over the last two months, but have been friends for about 1 year. We regularly get coffee in the mornings and I‚Äôve been to her flat a few times to do remote work together (different things but just working together because we‚Äôre both not good at staying focused). We‚Äôve also met for dinner a few times. She also texts me very frequently just about random things from her day which I‚Äôve started to reciprocate (I‚Äôm not a big texter tbh).

Anyways, lately we‚Äôve been talking about our struggles of dating and stuff. For context, I am currently working in Germany but moving back to the US in 2 weeks as my visa is expiring. She told me that she wants to start her ‚Äúhoe era‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt want to use dating apps because she feels like men there will sleep with anyone and, even though she just wants something casual, she wants it to be with someone who appreciates her as a person rather than just seeing her as a quick hookup. 

I‚Äôve kinda hinted at it as well, as it‚Äôs been quite awhile for both of us (2 years for me, 1 for her) and we both kind of agreed it would be nice to have something to get back on track and boost our confidences back up.

Some other reasons I think she‚Äôs been dropping hints is we‚Äôve been sharing stories of past experiences, and we pretty openly talk about the things we like and don‚Äôt like in sex. She also made a joke the other day because I was having trouble falling asleep and she suggested I masturbate and pass out lol.

Idk I‚Äôm really bad at dating and would just like some outside perspective before I (possibly) ruin a friendship by misinterpreting things

I got 4 inches off this tail of mine. 
See that bandage? Last Friday, my sweet girls with a tail that can clear a whole coffee table with one joyous wag, had to have 4 inches of it removed!
We think is started with a small wound commonly called ‚ÄúHappy Tail‚Äù (basically they get too excited too often and whack their tail enough to injure it). Then, she refused to stop licking it and everything I tried to cover it would fall off or she would remove it. It turned into a 1x1x1 inch growth on the tip of her tail that was bleeding when she‚Äôd get excited.

‚Äúyeah so people are being mean to me bc I perpetuated harmful misinformation to my millions of followers. I love Emmy she‚Äôs so funny but she made this into tiktok beef:(. when I lived amongst the poor ppl in Hollywood a few homeless people on drugs did said somw fucked up things to me so now I think all homeless people are evil and disgusting and they‚Äôre all looting. it‚Äôs just a difference of opinion, and I literally live here. Why is Emmy helping ppl (mind u she is, Tara is the one walking around Beverly Hills with her expensive iced coffee not doing SHIT). Now that I made all this onlyfans money off of borderline pedos I can move away from the evil homeless to my mansion in Beverly Hills & I don‚Äôt have to look at them anymore. and the bird thing ahahah whatever‚Äù 

I actually can‚Äôt fucking stand this bitch. like she is so evil. and all the trumpie loswrs (not a single one from LA) hyping her up in the comments. like she HATES broke ppl!! she isn‚Äôt gonna pick u!! years before she started onlyfans I lowk used to like her but she‚Äôs become actually disgusting.

1i1lido,https://www.reddit.com/r/graciethebrat/comments/1i1lido/this_is_for_you_grace/,This is for you Grace. ,"I know she reads this Reddit so I just have a couple things to get off my chest. 

Grace your behavior is nothing short of psychotic, there‚Äôs no way in hell your small TikTok engagement and shit talking about MK reached every business in your town so you ‚Äúcan‚Äôt get a job.‚Äù Get your head out of your ass and grow up. You must logically know the lies you spew out of your mouth are pure nonsense. Take some accountability for the life YOU have created for yourself.

   You could get a job, you prefer online panhandling 
and we both know it. You enjoy waking up in a camper and having ‚Äúdonations‚Äù which is actually just guilt money from you screaming about your horrible life to tiktok so hard working people will buy your expensive skincare, coffee, clothing, and food for you and your cat so you can dance on social media and whine about how everyone is so jealous of you for being a rare redhead. You‚Äôre a cute girl but you‚Äôre not that cute, you don‚Äôt have a different look like a model or anything people don‚Äôt see everyday. You need to humble yourself. You‚Äôve gotten so comfortable that your delusion makes you believe you can do this forever. More and more people LIKE ME who donated to you figure you out daily, you make gofundme after gofundme with a promise that this is for your ‚Äúfresh start‚Äù to get a real job and provide for yourself and that cat you purchased that you neglect. You never do ANYTHING responsible with the money except piss it away and beg for more. 

You use your self diagnosed autism for sympathy as well. You claim you‚Äôre just so scared and shy to be able to have a job but advertised you at million dollar properties with a bunch of strippers and posted videos daily of you drugged/ drunk screaming at them arguing for ‚Äúcontent‚Äù once upon a time from 2019-2023. You posted countless videos of you licking your lips twerking on stage. You used to heavily post about you having ‚ÄúBPD‚Äù and having episodes on your bf and others and then all of it got deleted once you figured out your baby voice and autism gig gets you countless money from hard working people. You changed everything that was you into an ‚Äúautistic, scared, Christian‚Äù the act must be tiring.

Christians follow the Bible and don‚Äôt speak ill on others, even if others do it to them ‚Äúvengeance is of the lord.‚Äù Yet every single day you harass MK and make a sob story about how she‚Äôs sabotaged your life today. SHE ONLY MADE A VIDEO TO DEFEND HERSELF BECAUSE YOU WONT STFU ABOUT HER AND SHE WAS GETTING MASS HARASSED. She has every right to tell her side of the story when you‚Äôre sending your clueless followers to fuck with her everyday. Maybe if you‚Äôd shut the fuck up about her all of this would die down but you won‚Äôt because this is another way you get pity from people. You use this old drama and dig it up every single day for more engagement. You‚Äôre a pathetic human being and I hope you choose to stop victimizing yourself in the future and get on with your life.

We‚Äôre all so tired of your shit sincerely. Get a job.

It's so simple but not everyone does it.  
  
It‚Äôs to ‚Äúgive‚Äù‚Ä¶  
  
Giving brings you joy since you‚Äôre helping people.  
  
Plus It‚Äôs a powerful form of gratitude when you help someone and they thank you.  
  
It will instantly make you feel great about yourself.  
  
And the best part is that it doesn't have to be something huge.  
  
It can be something as simple as buying coffee for the car behind you at Starbucks‚Ä¶  
  
Buying a homeless man a meal‚Ä¶  
  
Or volunteering at a shelter.  
  
I felt amazing when I first gave 40 bucks at the drive-through line at Starbucks and told them to use it for everyone behind me.  
  
Acts of kindness are incredible and If you haven‚Äôt done it before I highly recommend it.

It's like this: we're cruising through life, everything's peachy, and then BAM! Out of nowhere, life tosses a wrench in the gears. Whether it's a tough project at work, personal challenges, or just that feeling of being stuck in a rut, staying motivated can become a Herculean task. But hey, we're all in this together, right?

Here are some tips and tricks I've picked up along the way to keep that motivation train chugging along:

- **Break It Down:** Feeling overwhelmed? Take that giant task and chop it up like a chef with a new set of knives. Smaller steps make the journey feel more manageable. *Ever hear the joke about how to eat an elephant? One bite at a time!*

- **Find Your ‚ÄòWhy‚Äô:** Why are you pushing through this tough time? What's your end game? Whether it‚Äôs personal growth, a reward down the line, or just sheer stubbornness, cling to that ‚Äòwhy‚Äô like it‚Äôs a lifebuoy on a stormy sea.

- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Did you finally tackle that mountain of laundry, or did you make it through Monday without five cups of coffee? Celebrate it! Yes, your dance party is warranted. 

- **Seek Inspiration from Others:** Podcasts, books, community wisdom (nudge, nudge), or a quick scroll through *uplifting* social media feeds can do wonders. Nobody‚Äôs perfect, but everyone‚Äôs got a story. 

- **Buddy System:** Pair up with a friend who‚Äôs also slogging through something. Cheer each other on, and maybe send each other ridiculous memes. Laughter is a powerful motivator! üòÇ

- **Be Kind to Yourself:** Seriously, cut yourself some slack. Remember that nobody has it together all the time (despite what their Instagram might suggest). If you need a day to binge your favorite show, take it. Then get back on the horse.

Here's the thing: We all have those days when getting out of bed feels like winning the Olympics. And that's okay. Remember, even if you're crawling, you're still moving forward. Life might be serving lemons, but we've got the power to make some pretty awesome lemonade. üçã‚ú®

Keep pushing, and hey, I'd love to hear how *you* stay motivated. But no pressure‚Äîjust sharing your own journey can sometimes be the spark someone else needs to keep going.",1,1736902278.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

My name is David, and I‚Äôm a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô10‚Äù, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans‚Äîthink laid-back, metalhead vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I‚Äôm into:**

When I‚Äôm not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

‚Ä¢ Camping trips under the stars

‚Ä¢ Exploring museums

‚Ä¢ Renaissance faire adventures

‚Ä¢ Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn‚Äôt seen)

‚Ä¢ Playing board games or video games

Recently, I‚Äôve started learning a new language („Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I‚Äôm laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I‚Äôm completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who‚Äôs also looking to build a future together. I‚Äôd love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don‚Äôt have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I‚Äôm especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I‚Äôm not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren‚Äôt a big deal, so don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you‚Äôre a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to getting to know you better!",2,1736902092.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.75,False

I have been through the whole Victoria Police sexual crimes unit. The process took well over 12 months to complete.   Now they took my sister in for questioning,  and as expected she denied the whole situation.  My father was the only person to ever witness the abuse, and he ignored the abuse. 
             Now I come from a large family, 4 older sisters, and twin older brothers. All of my siblings are aware of the allegations, yet they all turn a blind eye to it and carry on like life is normal. Even my father , who I have spoken to about this, tells me to move on , get over it ,and live my life. The sister in question has done all she can to keep me on the outer with the rest of my family. I am not invited to Xmas or birthdays, I guess cause it will cause tension. They all sit down to Xmas dinner together like nothing ever happened. 
             Another thing I should point out is that my father is Chinese and my mother Australian.  My Dad is aware of what happened and being quite elderly I would not want to call him as a witness,but the police have advised me that without his testimony/statement they cannot press charges . I am considering taking the abusive sibling to civil court to sue her . This sibling is an absolute piece of work, she has 2 adult daughters who I'm damn sure if the situation was that I abused them then I'm sure the law would come after me. That's a given . I feel like because I am male and my abuser was a female that the Police haven't really done all they can to bring my sister to court.  
             I am considering civil legal action against her. I would like to destroy her life like she did my childhood. My mother knows nothing of the abuse, and I would like to make her aware. 
             My life has turned out way different from all of my other siblings, and I feel that my education was affected,  my childhood and adult life have all been greatly impacted by what happened. Yet the rest of my family are cool to sit down and have a meal/coffee/celebration with this sibling. Do I go the civil court avenue ? Or do I just unleash the anger and resentment and take the law into my own hands ? I know where she works and lives and I'm really at a point now where I would like to dish out some justice of my own , considering Vic Police sexual crimes unit have done pretty much nothing .....do i go to court ?",1,1736901915.0,FamilyIssues,1,1.0,False
