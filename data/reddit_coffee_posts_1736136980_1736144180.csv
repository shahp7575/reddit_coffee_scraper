QoL:
- Echo preset: Considering that farming good stat echo is crazy hard, we don't have much choice but to swap them back and forth, 5-8 Preset will definitely such a time saver.
- Fly mechanic in all regions after the player complete 100% of the region they want to fly in, I mean Rinascita is beautiful but Huanglong ain't bad either.
- Shorter respawn time for Overlord Bosses, We're not in the early stage of the game anymore, It take like 5 seconds to nuke an overlord, so reducing the respawn time, will help those who farm Echo faster since the probability for Stat and Sub-stat is almost mind-blowing bad.
- Sub stat changer: likited to 10 changes per echo, costing 20 tuners each time, this will help player have a better chance for echi sub stat while balancing the game with the limitations.


Event:
- Co-op racing events: we have a very fun fly mechanic, so why not implement an event where we can race each other? It doesn't need to have huge rewards, just an event to interact with other and also having fun.
- Actual parkour, and puzzles: I know some of us don't like stressing their brain, but some of us do, and the current puzzles and parkours are the equivalent of spoon feeding a baby, it's mad easy. Beside it's more content to  play with.
- Echo PvP: I know this is hard, there's alot to implement in the code for this, beside MMO don't really work well with gacha, but if wuwa can make this happen, it's gonna be so so fun to fight.

Places:
- Tavern: alright, look, I know some of y'all are introvert and stuff but wouldn't it be great if in 3.0, there's a tavern that players can get in, take a seat and just chat, it won't be lagging either since there's nothing really going on, just chatting.
- Viewing point: a place very high up where you van just enjoy the scenery, with the stando playing music for you while you afk, drinking coffee or something.
- a dark theme region/city: I noticed that the mirror puzzle color pallete for the world is very good, it's green, it's depressing, it's giving that sad type of story for rover. Imagine fighting a special undead type of tacet discords in a theme like that, literally soul like fr.

I put all this in my feedback for them, so even if one of them come true (especially the shorter respawn time), I'm hella satisfied.

I just wanted to share a small but exciting milestone with you all—We earned our first money from our side project! 🎉

A user who’s been trying out the tool We built was so convinced by it that they decided to support us on **Buy Me A Coffee**. I woke up to the notification, and honestly, the feeling is indescribable. It’s not just about the money (though that’s amazing); it’s about someone seeing value in something We created from scratch.

This moment makes all the late nights, debugging, and imposter syndrome worth it. Knowing that what We made is actually helping someone is such a huge motivator to keep going.

If you’re working on something and doubting whether it’s worth it, let this be a reminder: Someone out there will appreciate your effort. Keep at it—you’ll get there too!

To those who’ve already hit milestones like this, what was your first reaction when you earned your first bit of money from your project? Would love to hear your stories!

Thanks for reading, and here’s to many more milestones ahead. 🙌

1husfk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1husfk4/aitah_for_hating_my_job_working_with_autistic/,AITAH for hating my job working with autistic children?,"For a little background info: 

I (23F) am a behavioral aide for children with Autism and aggressive behaviors. My students are 3rd - 5th graders and all require a very high level of attention and care due to their aggressive behaviors and mental delays. Despite their behaviors, they’re very sweet kids and they all have good hearts, which is why I do what I do. 

I started this job about a year and a half ago and at first I truly loved it. I felt like I was doing something good for society, and although hard at times, it was extremely rewarding to see my students improve and learn to express their emotions in a healthy way. I thought for a while that this would be my career until I was ready to retire. However, recently I’ve experienced a lot of things that make me want to walk away and never return. 
Firstly, the aggression that my students exhibit is almost always physical. I work in a classroom with 4 other behavioral aides, and we all have our own experiences of being physically abused by our students. 
I’ve been bitten, scratched, punched in the face, kicked, slapped, had my hair ripped out, spit on, tackled, head butted, and one kid broke my favorite necklace attempting to put his hands around my neck.
We also have to hide our belongings and food or they’ll drink your coffee and steal your stuff. 

Even when the kids aren’t being physically aggressive, it’s so exhausting to manage them or have any type of structure in our classroom. The kids just want to do whatever they want to do, and if you say no or deny access to something they want, they’ll go right back into their aggressive behavior. Just a few weeks ago we had to do a physical restrained on one of our 5th grade boys because he was physically attacking staff and students and could not calm down no matter what we did. 

We have another student who I unfortunately have grown to despise. He’s a 5th grader as well and he’s probably one of the most high maintenance, defiant, and infuriating students I’ve ever had to deal with, even for a child with autism. 
Everything is a game to him, everything is funny, even funnier if you get mad at him. He craves attention and it doesn’t matter if it’s negative or positive. 
He takes his pants off in the middle of class and will throw them at your face over and over until you chase him around the room and force him to put them back on, all while laughing at you. All for him to take them off again 5 minutes later. 
He will run out of the classroom and force you to chase him. If you try to ignore these behaviors he starts to flip over tables and chairs, rip everything off the walls, open the cabinets and throw everything inside in the trash, take your phone out of your hands and throw it, you fucking name it. 
If it gives him attention, he will do it. 

The main thing about this job that I cannot stand though is the people I work with. 
I understand that our job is hard to stay enthusiastic about and it’s hard to be nice when you’re being abused all day. 
But I have one coworker specifically who seems to hate me and everything I do. 
I don’t like to argue, but she always wants to. 
This is not a competition but she treats it like one. 

I want to quit and find a job that makes me happy but I’m so far into this career path that I almost feel stuck in it. I have everything I need to move forward and if I give up now, I can’t come back. It’s hard to think about going back to a restaurant or retail job when I’m so used to working a job that genuinely makes a difference to someone. But my mental health is at its breaking point and I know i can’t do this for much longer. 

Would it be wrong of me to leave in the middle of the school year? Am I a bad person for secretly hating my job and my students? Where do I go from here?",1,1736143417.0,AITAH,9,0.99,False

No Idea what the other mods on it are,  Just a bunch of random ones.  I never even looked at them.  I Just started soloing a few days ago.

Perks are the standard, 3x3 Heavy gunner, Trav Pharm, Lock and Load

No Perception, Standard 15 in Endurance,  Lifegiver, Bullet shield, and some others

9 In charisma, some QOL with Tenderizer 

14 in INT, With the Demo Expert and Stabilized

11 in luck with Bloody Mess, One Gun Army, Ricochet

Weapons are Fully modded Gatlin Plasma (Vampire, Explosive) with Stabilizers 

Gatlin Gun Vampire

Gauss Minigun (Anti-Armor Explosive) I Put Bullys on it just because I found one, No idea if it helps. 

How I do the fight,  I Just Shoot Vampire Gatlin Gun at him until the shield is gone, Letting Ricochet and Bullet shield do the work, When Shield is gone, usually 2 and a half minutes in, I Jump on his platform and die.

I got back in restart the fight (Dont leave the instance) and start shooting with the Vampire Explosive Gatlin Plasma, I actually use the Pillars, and one can see half of his body while shooting.  I dunno if it makes a difference of him hitting me more.  This is also not a great way to do it either because I have to repair the Gatlin Plasma after every run, due to the explosive damaging the gun so fast,  But Whatever, It dont bother me

Okay after the Gatlin Plasma, I Switch to the Gauss Minigun at about his 10% health to finish him off,  That way I end up with 450 rounds of 2mm EC for a reward.  

The whole thing takes me about 5 - 6 minutes.  I heard the Jump on him with an Axe is getting nerfed, So I purposely avoided that with all Guns.

I Dont use vats, Although I should But it would be alot of work to get new mods for my weapons, change out my loadout, get used to chugging coffee and tea, Or however you do it to keep AP up.  

So I just run in, Point and shoot.  And it works.  5 or 6 minutes,

1husby0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiExpertPankaj/comments/1husby0/how_ai_will_transform_your_life_in_2025/,How AI Will Transform Your Life in 2025?,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is not just a buzzword; it's a transformative force shaping our lives in ways we couldn't have imagined a decade ago. By 2025, AI will be deeply embedded in our daily routines, making tasks easier, improving productivity, and enhancing our overall quality of life. Let’s dive into how AI will affect your life in 2025 with real-life examples.

1. AI in Personal Productivity

Imagine waking up in the morning, and your AI-powered virtual assistant has already prepared a personalized schedule for you. It integrates your work meetings, personal errands, and even reminds you of your fitness goals. By analyzing your previous habits and preferences, AI can suggest the most efficient ways to tackle your tasks.

Real-Life Example: Meet Sarah, a freelance graphic designer. In 2025, Sarah uses an AI tool that automatically organizes her day. It prioritizes her projects based on deadlines and client importance, sends reminders for breaks to avoid burnout, and even suggests design inspirations by analyzing current design trends. This not only saves her hours each week but also boosts her creativity and output.

2. AI in Health and Wellness

Health is wealth, and AI is revolutionizing how we manage our well-being. From personalized fitness plans to early disease detection, AI is a game-changer in health and wellness.

Real-Life Example: John, a busy entrepreneur, struggles to find time for his health. In 2025, he relies on an AI-driven health app that monitors his vital signs through wearable devices. The app provides real-time feedback, suggesting dietary adjustments, workout routines, and even predicting potential health issues before they become serious. This proactive approach keeps John healthier and more energized.

3. AI in Home Automation

Smart homes are becoming smarter. AI-driven home automation systems learn your preferences and adjust settings to make your living environment more comfortable and efficient.

Real-Life Example: Emma’s home in 2025 is equipped with an AI-powered smart system. Her lights, thermostat, and even kitchen appliances are controlled by AI. When Emma wakes up, the coffee maker starts brewing her favorite blend, the lights adjust to her preferred brightness, and the thermostat sets the perfect temperature. This seamless integration of AI makes her daily life effortless and enjoyable.

4. AI in Education and Learning

Education is being transformed by AI, making learning more personalized and accessible. AI tutors and learning platforms provide customized learning experiences tailored to individual needs and learning paces.

Real-Life Example: Tom, a college student in 2025, uses an AI-powered learning app that adapts to his learning style. It identifies areas where he struggles and provides additional resources, quizzes, and explanations to help him grasp difficult concepts. This personalized approach accelerates his learning process and improves his academic performance.

5. AI in Work and Collaboration

AI is changing the way we work, making collaboration more efficient and streamlining workflows. From automating mundane tasks to providing insights for decision-making, AI is an indispensable tool in the modern workplace.

Real-Life Example: Lisa works in a marketing agency. In 2025, she uses AI tools to analyze market trends, automate email campaigns, and even generate content ideas. AI helps her team collaborate more effectively by managing project timelines and ensuring everyone is on the same page. This results in higher productivity and better team outcomes.

Conclusion

As we look towards 2025, it's clear that AI will play a pivotal role in shaping our lives. From boosting productivity and improving health to transforming education and work, AI is set to make our lives easier, more efficient, and more enjoyable.

I haven't had any coffee, tea, caffeinated soda or chocolate bars. I have some chocolaty granola with yogurt here and there. I still feel much better. I do still look for external thrills (vices) at times.  I also have been lusting in coffee/tea subreddits a bit ;). I know better though and you do too. I miss the ritual and I know I should find another that'll help create some semblance of scheduling. 

I also did a 2 day dry fast which I think was beneficial in learning to let go of bad habits and just learning to shut up more. You could say dry January started 2 days ago too.  Hoping to do a longer water fast soon. I hope to spend my year more wisely and set my ship on a course for success. To me this means faith in practice. I've spent a long time fucking up.

Among the most iconic structures within the historic fortress of Gwalior is the Teli Ka Mandir, a towering 8th-9th century temple rising nearly 80 feet. Over the centuries, this ancient marvel has served many purposes, once even functioning as a coffee shop.

The temple’s name, “Teli Ka Mandir,” is believed to derive from “Teli” or “Telin,” meaning “oil dealer.” Folklore credits an oil merchant with funding its construction, though this remains unverified, and its original name has been lost to time.

Debates surround the temple’s presiding deity. A Garuda icon atop the lintel suggests a Vishnu association, while carvings of Lakulisa on the door jambs point to links with Shiva. A third theory connects the temple to the Matrikas, linking it to the Shakta sect of goddesses. It is plausible that the temple’s religious affiliation shifted over time.

During the invasion of the Delhi Sultan Iltutmish, the temple suffered significant damage. Later, under British rule, it was repurposed as a coffee shop by a British garrison stationed in the Gwalior fort.

This state of neglect persisted until 1879, when Major Keith of the Royal Scots Regiment oversaw extensive restoration efforts (See picture No. three). 

Today, the Teli Ka Mandir stands as a beautifully preserved relic, showcasing its historical and architectural significance in full glory.

Years of intensive therapy helped me reach a stable place, so much so that even as I went through burnout, I didn't fall into the the darkest pits of despair that would've been waiting for me before. 

Still I feel like my default ""personality"" or whatever is existential melancholy. Does anyone else have that? 

I have highs, especially if I get to experience my little routine exactly as I want it, but the melancholy is still there. I do struggle, especially with anxiety, unemployment, not having money, isolation, interpersonal issues from time to time, executive dysfunction, human stuff like that. But I'm also better than I've ever been in many, many many ways, and mostly content with what I'm doing.

So at this point, I don't know what else to do. I don't feel like more therapy will fix this. Then I feel like I might feel happier if I reach my goals, if I get to be more independent, but then I feel like, as with everything else, I'll be happy for a while and it'll change my life for the better but my default will still be melancholy. 

It's got to a point where, and I know this is silly, I've decided to romanticise my melancholy. Just read a poem, drink a cup of coffee, look at the sunset, allow myself to feel the melancholy and tell myself that so many people, including so many artists I adore must've felt like this, so it's okay if it never really goes away. It helps and makes me feel like I'm in a film or something, which is kinda nice, but at the same time I think I'd rather just not feel melancholy and philosophise about existing so fucking often?? I just feel like I have no choice, like I've been like this for literal decades now, like I'm healthy now but this is how I am and that's it.

Sadly, my housing situation really couldn’t be any worse at the moment. 

I’m renting a room in a home that I’ve been a tenant in for the last 3 years. My downstairs roommate is great dude he’s been in the home for 10+ years he isn’t the problem. 

The problem is the two roommates that I share the upstairs portion of the house with. Two males here on student visas, who are friends of each others. 

Since they’ve moved in it’s been nothing but hell. They refuse to clean up after each other. Messes left around the house, refusing to wash dishes, take out the trash, things of that nature. They continually disregard the quite hours ordinance staying up beyond 2AM and making excessive noise even sometimes as late as 4AM being excessively loud, speaking in a foreign language, laughing, gaming, etc. 

Every time I confront them about an issue I’m met with hostility from them nearly to the point of a fist fight breaking out. Beside the excessive noise and disregard for the quite hours ordinance, they continually leave house lights on seemingly intentionally and have left the door to the house completely unlocked and accessible several times recently despite not being home, again likely intentionally. It’s my opinion that they’re conspiring together to create this hostile take over living environment. 

I’ve personally been harassed by them to the point where I can’t make coffee in the morning or cook, they’ll essentially “camp out” in the common spaces and continue to create this aggressive hostile environment. If not that, they’ll bang on my door trying to intimate me for whatever reason. I have videos of their behavior which I’ve sent to my Landlord and he refusing to advocate me. He says there’s nothing substantial that deems that it isn’t a safe living environment (Which is Bullsh**)

My Landlord is refusing to step in because I recently exposed him for numerous incidents of illegal entry onto the property (Not giving full and proper 24hour notice or not having valid reasoning for being on-site)

I have no intentions of moving. I love my neighborhood and have a strong connection to it. I’ve been a tenant in this home for nearly three and a half years. 

I need help with advice on how to move forward, what steps I need to take and what people I need to talk to. I definitely want to report my Landlord for the illegal entries and need advice on what can be done about these specific roommates.

1huryw3,https://www.reddit.com/r/petsitting/comments/1huryw3/need_advice_for_upcoming_job/,Need Advice for Upcoming Job,"OK, so I'm fairly well-seasoned at pet sitting, but I'm self-employed, so every penny I make is essential because if I don't work, I don't get paid. I'm sure many of you are in the same boat.

I know this is mostly my own fault because I am a little too nice to my clients and I am not the best at standing up for myself when they short change me financially. But lately, I'm starting to get so frustrated that I have been a little better at standing up for myself. A couple months ago a client canceled on me 2 days before a 3 week job, so I charged them a 50% cancellation fee because they'd booked me a year in advance. I was pissed. But I don't works as much in the winter, so I've been off for the past month and change, so money is beyond TIGHT. My next gig is in a couple days.

So, as I mentioned, I have a dog that I'll be caring for in a couple of days - I start on 1/7 and am supposed to be there until 1/14, so a week with this pup. I've been this guys dog sitter for over 2 years as well. When I dog sit, I stay at the clients house, care for the dog and generally don't leave unless I have a doctor's appointment or another dog walking gig to do in the middle of the day for a couple of hours, or maybe coffee with a friend, etc. So, I am generally with this guys dog a good 18-20 hours a day though at all times. 

I charge $70 flat rate per day which includes me spending the night. I definitely know I don't charge enough, but that's a whole other can of worms! Well, I spoke to him earlier this evening, as I wanted to just touch base for Tuesday morning as I always do, and also confirm exactly what time he would be home on the 14th, and he said, ""oh yeah, I'm actually coming home on the 12th now, sorry I forgot to tell you."" That's great for him, but for me, it's $140 I'm now not getting because he's got a different return date and only told me today. He leaves at 3 a.m. on Tuesday morning, so technically as I type this, he's leaving for his flight in 26.5 hours. And he told me this information about 6 hours ago. So, it's like 32 hours notice about shortchanging me. 

He said we'd touch base again tomorrow, so when I talk to him, I'm thinking about just being honest and saying because he gave me such last minute notice about the return date change, I will have to charge him for the entire time he'd booked me as I can't get any additional work now because I was holding those dates for him. But I'm just so nervous to say anything - I'm extremely sensitive (I'm autistic), and I don't deal with confrontation well. Charging that other client a cancellation fee back in October wasn't too hard because they'd already paid me, I just had to return the other half of the money. But this is different. 

I have a good relationship with this guy and his doggie and I am worried about losing business. He's got the money, the guy has a 2 million dollar beach house. I mean, not that I'm judging based on the house alone, but he's told me that he's financially quite comfortable. I think he's a decent guy, but sometimes I wonder if he even realizes how much of a blow that is for someone like me when he does stuff like this. Like to him $140 is money he finds in his couch cushions, but for me, that's money to buy groceries or pay a bill. I don't make a lot of money, like I am def. on the poverty line. He's done this date changing thing a couple of times before, but that was 2-3 weeks before the job, so I wasn't taken off guard as much as I am now.  

I know what I need to do, but I'm scared to do it. I just want to say it in a way that doesn't come off as abrasive or desperate. Any advice would be appreciated <3.",2,1736141743.0,petsitting,1,1.0,False

You can see he longs to be how he once was in the past in Vegas, as he’s mesmerised by coffee, badges, cherry pie, etc. 

When he awakens in hospital, he rushes straight to twin peaks and after everything seemingly comes together, the first clue he’s not happy enough with this ending comes in with his  superimposed face saying ‘live inside a dream’.

That fails and after Diane leaves him he heads to Laura or Carrie. The car ride over you can tell he’s not in the right headspace as he doesn’t even respond to Laura. I think he’s now coming to regret those years he lost.

In the final scene he is utterly confused and asks ‘What year is this?’ The first time he followed up on the iconic 25 years later the entire season, he seemed to ignore all the year gone by full functioning but when catonic seemed to reflect more.  

I feel as if that was the first time he was fully self aware the whole season and I think it was fully intentional. You get caught up in life and the years pass by and you think is this how I wanted to live my life and the regret can you harder than you expect.",1,1736141178.0,u_Thomasrocky1,0,1.0,False
1hursjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1hursjp/mild_gastritis_symptoms_everyday/,Mild Gastritis Symptoms Everyday,"I’m 30 years old and have been living with chronic gastritis since I was 15, so it’s been 15 years. Over this time, there have been both difficult and better periods. During the tough years, I’m careful with my diet, avoiding ""bad"" foods, but symptoms still affect me. I became severely underweight due to stomach pain, nausea, vomiting (including bile), and extreme fatigue. It was a really hard time, and I felt like I couldn’t enjoy life. I also struggle with anxiety and stress, which I believe contribute to flare-ups. 

After having a child and working from home, my condition improved, and I could eat a wider variety of foods. Now, four years later, it is still mild. I eat almost everything except coffee, alcohol, carbonated drinks. I also limit my chocolate, tomato-based sauce and milk, but I still have it occasionally or more than that at times. 

I experience mild symptoms every day, like a sour taste in my mouth and mild discomfort in my stomach, but nothing too severe. On bad days, I might have nausea or mild stomach pains, but they usually pass quickly. At worst, the symptoms can last for weeks, along with fatigue. I’m just curious if anyone else experiences these symptoms daily, even if they’re mild? And if so, could this constant low-level discomfort lead to more severe issues in the long run, even though I can tolerate it?

1hurs65,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultChild/comments/1hurs65/my_mother_threatened_to_kh_after_i_sent_her_a/,My mother threatened to KH after I sent her a message describing her abuse ,"TW: suicidal tendencies 

I was out of the country for 2 years, came back to stay with my mom over Christmas and New Year. It was the first time I would stay at her place with my husband after getting married. First she started by mumbling under her breath “I can’t stand you” every time I said something she disliked. Then on the New Year’s night (which, for context, is a major celebration in my country, bigger than Christmas) she started cursing when I put the president’s speech on the TV (in our country the president says a short speech before the ball drops) she was very loud and aggressive telling to “turn that shit off”, before that she took out her old plates that were clearly dirty with grease stains on them and served them on the table, she lashed out on me when I said I need to wash these first because they’re dirty. After doing all that and a lot of other things that made me question her sanity she lashed out on me and gaslighted me saying “why are you so aggressive, I am not doing anything wrong?!”.

The day after new years we had to go see my father (my parents are divorced) who was physically abusive to me along with my mom when I was a child, his wife cooked some food that was not the best but still we pretended to eat it just to be polite and nice. After the dinner was done we went to grab a bite downtown and came home. The next morning after my husband left to grab some coffee, she came into my room while I was still sleeping and started scolding me for being an “ungrateful daughter” she started cursing me and saying “I curse you, you will never be happy” because we didn’t eat her food the day before after the dinner with my dad. After I told her to leave my room she came bursting back in 5 mins later “looking for a book” she couldn’t find it, I asked her to leave my room she said “I don’t care what you say, I need to find this book, this is my house I can do what I want” and did that 3 times: bursting in the room, looking for a book, me saying leave me alone, her saying I can do what I want this is my house. On the 4th time when she bursted into my room with me still in bed telling her to leave I yelled at her at told her to get the F out of my room. She stared gaslighting me again saying “why are you angry? What’s wrong with you? You have anger issues. How do you speak with your mother?” That gave me a panic attack and by then my husband was back and he saw me crying and shaking. We packed our things and got an airbnb while she left to go see my brother and his wife to complain how bad of a daughter I was. My brother called me trying to make us talk to each other but it didn’t work. She would still not understand what she did wrong. 

The day after I wrote her this message:

“Mom, I am going to say this in English, if you don’t understand please use google translate. You have been hurting me with your words for as long as I remember myself. You and my father poisoned my childhood and my teenage years, I don’t think I will ever be able to forgive you for that as I don’t think you understand how much damage you have done to me. From years of living with you i developed a very strong fight or flight mode as a result of your constant verbal and physical abuse. I feel trapped when you talk mean things to me and I feel like if I don’t fight you I will suffer and get hurt like I did for 36 years of my life. You fill your life with hate towards people and your toxic attitude towards others has made it hard for me to trust people. You told me everyone wants to hurt me, is jealous of me and is a threat to me and o believed you, you alienated me from my friends, from my father, his family. You made me believe that everyone wants to hurt me while you were the one who hurt me most. I never felt respected or loved by you, I always thought you have a strange way of expressing your love for me that turned to anger all the time. You were always angry at me, and because of that I developed people pleasing qualities, your hurtful words forever stayed in my head and I never felt like I’m going to be good enough for you to love me. You were never satisfied with who I am, I was never good enough for you to love me, you always found reasons to complain about me and were never truly satisfied with me. I can’t forget how you beat me, how you chased and hit me with a knife, how angry you made me. You would hurt me with your words and gaslight me when I would react angrily to them. You always played victim and made me feel like it’s my fault that you beat me, it my fault that you yell at me, it my fault that you curse me, but how could it be my fault? I was a child who never saw her parents show genuine affection for her, a child who grew up with her parents being constantly angry at her and disappointed at her, maybe because of all your yelling I developed hearing problems because I couldn’t hear you scream at me or each other any more. 

I had to work on myself for years to understand that I don’t deserve your abuse. And yet I don’t think you believe it, I think you think I deserved it, I think you think you were always right. I went out at night to clubs and parties just to escape you and the hell that I called home, I was looking for love and family somewhere else because I felt that my family will never love me. I did everything to run away from you and your hurtful words, I escaped to the other side of the planet to run away from the pain you have caused me, but now that I’m back I feel that pain stronger than ever.

I don’t think you understand how jumpy you have made me, because of you coming into my room and screaming and beating me all the time I developed I became very fearful and constantly jumpy from sudden noises. I never feel safe in a room unless the door is shut, I always think someone will come through the door and hurt me. I also get overstimulated sometimes and my brain shuts down when there’s a lot of noises around me. I feel attacked, I feel like I will be attacked from every corner constantly when I’m outside which is why I’m always very aware of my surroundings. Because you constantly ignore my requests to “stop talking” and to “leave me alone” I feel like I am never safe around you and never can hide from your verbal abuse. You never respect my boundaries and my personal space. You constantly act like a victim and never take full responsibility for your actions. I traveled across the world to come see you this year and I didn’t deserve the attitude I was getting from you. Everything I did for you was never enough for you, you constantly complained about me and made me feel like I would never deserve your love. Because of that I developed severe Borderline disorder and bipolar disorder, I never thought I would deserve to be loved because you told me that so many times. You said no man will love me, you said I don’t deserve love, you said you can’t stand me. It is only after marriage that I realized that everyone deserves love, even a broken woman like me. I don’t know of you will ever understand the gravity of the pain that you have caused me. 

I hope Tom (my brother) can teach you how to love and be empathetic, I hope he can make you proud, I know I never did. You are a very angry woman and I hope you learn how to turn your anger into something more meaningful and less destructive for yourself and others around you. I hope you learn how to socialize with others instead of being angry at the world. No person in this world can make you happy if you can’t appreciate and respect them. Your anger alienated you from a lot of people and I hope you find strength to reconnect with others in a loving and positive manner. You have so much hate in yourself, I hope you learn how to release it. I don’t know if I will ever forgive you for everything you did to me. I don’t hate you, but I can’t live with you forever either. I hope you learn how to love again. I hope you give my cats all the love and care they deserve.” 

And shortly after my brother called me saying “what did you do? She’s now threatening to kill herself! By jumping off a bridge ” I tried calling her she wasn’t picking up, and then after hours of trying to get a hold of her my brother called me saying she’s okay. The she called me saying “what do you want?” And I said “I just wanted to make sure you’re not doing anything stupid” and she said “I’m a Christian woman I would never do such a thing, you’re making it up” 

I don’t talk to her after that, my brother said she’s now sick at home with fever, we think it’s regular flu but she says she’s got fever because of what I said to her in the message. 

I don’t know what to do. Shall I go NC again? Shall I apologize? Was it wrong for me to tell her all that? ",1,1736141080.0,EstrangedAdultChild,0,1.0,False

I haven’t said anything to him, but he hasn’t contacted me about that second date either. The main thing that he told me that we’re a lie was that he had been divorced for two years. What I found was he was divorced then remarried and got divorced again four months ago. In fact, I’m not even sure that divorce is finalized since the court records didn’t say finalized.

1huroww,https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1huroww/sysco_syy_a_good_value_investing_stock/,Sysco ($SYY): a good value investing stock ,"# Happy New Year!

This is the my first write up of a new stock this year, although i wrote an [update](https://www.reddit.com/user/raytoei/comments/1hpbqge/investment_diary_yum_brands_china_earnings_growth/) on YUMC in the past week.

======================

SYSCO is a grocer to restaurants and canteens found in Universities, Hospital etc. It calls itself  a Wholesale Restaurant Food Distributor.

**Morningstar's description:**

`Sysco is the largest US foodservice distributor with 17% share of the highly fragmented $370 billion domestic market. It distributes roughly 500,000 food and nonfood products to restaurants (62% of fiscal 2024 revenue, education and government buildings (7%), travel and leisure (6%), healthcare facilities (7%), and other locations (18%) where individuals consume away-from-home meals. In fiscal 2024, 70% of the firm’s revenue was derived from its US foodservice operations, while its international (18%), quick-service logistics (10%), and other (2%) segments contributed the rest.)`

A longer description of the business can be found on page 7 of its [2024 (End June) annual report.](https://investors.sysco.com/~/media/Files/S/Sysco-IR/documents/annual-reports/Sysco_2024-Annual-Report_Web.pdf)

Here is my datasheet on SYY, you should refer to it when reading this aricle:

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z8DK9K3FHLnv5JsTIwuZB8bbDUrIlvn-wR5ch5mElXM/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z8DK9K3FHLnv5JsTIwuZB8bbDUrIlvn-wR5ch5mElXM/edit?usp=sharing)

I have removed all the links and valuation calculations. What could be useful to you are the past 10 year's data, valuation ratios, my ROE deconstruction, the consensus estimates, my calcualtion of past growth, and also pre-covid, covid growth rates, and the results of my valuation of the company.

**Disclosure & Disclaimer**: I do not own any SYY stock although I usually do a write-up before buying a tracker stock. This is not an investment advice for you to buy Sysco. My articles usually cause people to lose money because i am always too early ( remember Nike, Hershey, and Modelez ? of course there there are also Crocs, Disney also, which are appreciating nicely). My portfolio can be found in my reddit homepage.

======================

**1. First the Bad News**

Sysco is at 10 year lows, and it is cheap for a reason: a. Flat restaurant sales +  b. Rising menu prices and input costs + c. Rising labour costs = The Restaurant Industry is in a crisis as people are eating out less, put off by inflation.

Sysco is also not immune to recession or any slow down in economic activity (eg. Covid). 

The silver lining are two: First, roughly 15% of their business are recession resistent, these are schools, gahmen and hospitals. The other silver lining is that although COVID dropped their share-price by a whopping 58%, the share price recovered and end the year 2020  with only a negative 12%. And while the S&P 500 lost 18% in 2022 (with dividend reinvested), SYY ended 2022 flat.

**The other big reason why you may not like Sysco as a potential candidate for investment is that even though it is at a ten year low, it isnt that far off from all time highs. My opinion is that we are currently in a period where value stocks are quite neglected, this is such a boring company that it doesnt make it into dinner conversations, as compared to AI, Nuclear, Rocket, Meme Stocks etc.** 

The last reason why you should not invest in Sysco is that they missed their latest earnings forecast.

**2. What i like about Sysco**

\- Almost linear growth of revenue and earnings . Only 2020 and 2021 had lower revenue and earnings (gaap and non-gaap) growth than the previous year.

\- They retired 16% of the shares outstanding in the last 10 years

\- It is cheapest in the last 10 years in the metrics P/S, P/E and EV/EBITDA

\- The ROA is > 7% , ROE, ROIC and ROCE are in the high teens, consistent in the last 10 years except for 2020 and 2021.

\- It has been growing divdends for the last 55 consecutive years, Sysco belongs to a small group where these stocks are crowned as **Dividend Kings**. Despite the impresive long term dividend growth, the payout ratio is on average only 52-55% of earnings.

\- the company is shareholder friendly. Despite a small dividend yield of just 2.65%, they buy back their shares and push the overall total yield to around 6% most recently, their average with the last 10 years is around 4.88%

**3. Other things to note**

\- the DEBT / EQUITY looks scary at 5.8, this is due to their shrinking equity due to share buy backs. It takes around 6.5 years to pay back the debt, which is the median of the last 10 years D/E Ratio. The Net Debt / Ebitda is within the [target ratio of 2.7x.](https://investors.sysco.com/annual-reports-and-sec-filings/news-releases/2024/07-30-2024-130425605#:~:text=Net%20Debt%20to%20adjusted%20EBITDA,and%20%241.0%20billion%20of%20dividends)

\- this is a low margin business typical of a distribution business. However, they have been remarkably consistent in managing its costs, and even increased their margins over time. See Row 46 to 60 under the column ""First 5 years"" and ""Next 5 years"". The FCF margin is consistenly around 2.5% or greater.

**4. Growth (Past, Present and Future)**

Here are some past growth:

|10 years CAGR|5 years CAGR|3 years CAGR|
|:-|:-|:-|
|9.84%|12.22%|40% (due covid low base)|
||||

However, it maybe more useful to analyse Pre-covid and Post-covid so we get a sense of what could be, when post-covid normalisation is realised.



||Pre-Covid|Post-Covid|
|:-|:-|:-|
|5 year period|2014 june to  2019 june|2019 June to 2024 June|
|Revenue CAGR|5.26%|5.5%|
|EPS CAGR|15%|4 -5% with smoothing|



I double checked on the Pre-covid EPS, the 3 year CAGR provid was around 22-24%

This business has a lot of operating leverage, where EPS will outgrow the Revenue .

The company is guiding between 4-6% for revenue, and 6-8% for EPS growth.

Which doesnt makes sense, because if they could do around 10 to 15% a year in EPS growth, why are they only calling out for only 7% moving forward? My opinion, is that they are either conservative or are making adjustments to the new realities of a major slowdown in the restaurant industry.

**5. Competitive advantage of Sysco**

\- Scale economies

(a) Lower cost advantage due to regional negotiation with suppliers

(b) Nation-wide coverage works as a barrier of entry for smaller players. Imagine negotiating with national chains in supplying fresh foods (eg. Wendy) or Coffee for Starbucks and providing coverage to every store in the country. This barrier is so high, the moat is so wide.

(c) Route Density

Let me quote M\* ""More importantly, its scale drives route density, leading to an even bigger difference in operating margin. As shipping costs are about 40% of operating expenses, Sysco’s fiscal 2024 adjusted operating margin of 4.4% exceeds Performance Food’s 1.4% and US Foods’ 2.9%.""

\- etc

The CFO alluded to a ""grow as customer grow"" program where they create proprietary SKU, and processes. They are quite mum about it but if it works, it would certainly increase the switching costs.

Here is thre quote from the[ recent event:](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1698389&tp_key=9ac6fbd266)

`You’re probably wondering, okay, so how do you expand margins on these? I’ll give you a good example - Sysco brand, thinking about obviously in a national basket, there is proprietary SKUs, if you will. There’s also other things that are proprietary SKUs, that we’re trying to partner and have trade deals with them, so overall we’re seeing that. Again, these are things where we have--again, I won’t go into too much detail, but we work very, very hard on these contracts and have a win-win scenario, where the more they grow, the more we grow as well.`

\- Morningstar is a little less optimistic than me: ""The lack of pricing power and switching costs among foodservice distributors leaves Sysco at risk for intense price competition.""

**6. Drivers to Growth**

Despite being the largest distributor, it has only 17% of the market share, this shows that the market  is fragmented with many smaller players.  Sysco has previously made 23 acquisitions:

|Year|\# Acquisitions|
|:-|:-|
|2023|1|
|2021|4|
|2019|5|
|2018|2|
|2017|2|
|2016|4|
|2005|1|
|1999|1|
|1985|1|

It made the most number of acqusitions just before Covid, i would expect this to continue as a growth driver, especially if the outlook is poor, then the industry is ripe for consolidation, and Sysco would stand to benefit.

Currently only 20% of Sysco's business is outside of the US with the majority in the United Kingdom, Canada, France.

Mote 莫特, who write on the F&B industry,  has a better researched article on Sysco's M&A and international expansion, you can read it [here](https://www.foodtalks.cn/en/news/55035).

**7. Valuation**

|Method|price|comments|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Level II|91-92||
|Blended|88-91||
|CFRA|84||
|Morningstar|80||
|Reverse NPV|80-87|based on 5% growth from  TTM of 3.8 to 4.3.|
|Current Price|75||

I rate the fair value somewhere between $80 and $92. I note that I am more bullish than Morningstar or CFRA. My blended valuation incoporates relative valuation into the mix, pushing it higher, eg. SYY 10 year average EV/EBITDA is around 14 versus currently at  12, historical 10 year P/E ratio is around 25 versus currently at  19.

**8 My conclusion**

This is a high quality stock, that is not expensive to own as the industry is having issues. Investors are convinced that Sysco is a slow horse that can earn only at  5% earnings growth, especially since it missed its most recent earnings forecast (see line 133 of the data sheet).

The current guidance is 7%, this makes the potential shareholder return at 7% + 2.65% dividend yield or 9.65% potential returns a year. I would consider this the minimum, if one is patient, one could expect Sysco to catch up to its pre-covid growth forecasts.

For those who might’ve missed my first post here, I’m 22(F) and moved out of Cairo for good at 16.

Tonight my dad’s two oldest sons, who didn’t know our father for most of their lives, reached out to me to ask about our background. Unfortunately, I don’t know a whole lot about it. I asked my daddy but he doesn’t know much either. Says he never thought to ask. My brothers wanted to know our grandpa’s name but dad wouldn’t say. I didn’t know my grandpa was still alive until a few months before he died some years back. My daddy was estranged from his daddy, but he promised to take me to meet him. I never did. Likely because I was still young and simply forgot. 

My thoughts last time were pretty disjointed, and while I want to promise it’ll be more together this time around, it won’t be. 

The Cairo I remember didn’t have much, and has even less now, but for a short time it had a store called The Ace of Cups. I lived on 8th street back when The Ace of Cups still existed, it was just a little coffee shop/crafts store/bookstore. I would go there with my cousins and the workers would give us free hot chocolate and take us to the crafts room to draw and paint.

I’ve always loved art and now as an adult I still draw. I wish I remembered their names, but the lady who worked at The Ace taught us to make puppets from paper plates. My cousins and I would spend hours there and we were never asked to leave or made to feel unwelcome. Sometimes we’d just lounge around in the chairs and read the old books they had there. I don’t think we ever bought anything, didn’t have the money for it, but we enjoyed everything The Ace had to offer regardless. 

Speaking of books, one of the best buildings in Cairo is its town library. I remember the smell so distinctly. The books were old, some were so old they still had those cloth cover books sometimes have. The Ace had that smell too. I wish I could make it into a candle. 

Another of Cairo’s best buildings from my childhood was the activity center. I don’t remember its real name, but I remember being so jealous when my mom would drop off my brothers and sister to play basketball and hang out with their friends. They never wanted to take me along so I never got to go while it still existed. 

There’s the post office, too. Back when my daddy was incarcerated I used to go there all the time with my mom to send him letters and pick up the letters he sent to us. We had a P.O. box back then. I remember how beautiful the building was on the inside and that it also smelled like the library, but more like new paper than the paper from those old books. 

Then there was Upward Bound. Where I live now, Upward is an educational program to help high school students accrue college credits and keep their grades up. Back in Cairo, Upward was a sports center for little kids. They only offered basketball and cheerleading, though. My sister did both when she was around 7-8 and my brothers did basketball when they were around the same age. When I was 7 or 8 I got to do cheerleading with one of my cousin’s at Upward and I’ll never forget how happy I was to do it. My God-sister was there as well and my God-mother helped with coaching. 

I quit Upward toward the end of the season after I chipped my tooth. Practice was over and I was running to get to my dad’s car, excited as I always am to see him, and some kid tripped me. I fell flat on my face and chipped my front tooth. The way I cried you would’ve thought I hit every nerve I had but surprisingly I didn’t hit a single one. I was too young to get a crown, so the dentist put a filling on it. Two years later I broke the filling off trying to show my daddy a magic trick. The one where you put a quarter through the back of your neck and it comes out of your mouth. Yeah… that damn quarter took my filling right on with it. 

I’ve always been close with my daddy. He hasn’t always been the best parent but he’s the best one I got out of two. He’s my best friend and biggest cheerleader. Everyone says I look, act and talk just like him. Which is funny because he used to tell me growing up “If you turn out like your momma, you’ll be all right. But if you turn out like me, I’m ‘on have to kill ya.” 

I wish I knew more about his family and where we came from. I want to know how our family ended up in Cairo. Who my grandpa was. I tried to look up my dad’s background online to see if his daddy was listed under relatives, but he wasn’t. I’m not even listed under his relatives for some reason. Two of my mom’s older kids are, and a few of my uncles’ kids are listed, but not me. None of my brothers from his side. Not my little sister either, but she’s only 9. 

I thought about asking you guys if y’all knew anything about my daddy’s family but I don’t want to risk giving out me and my family’s government names online. 

I think I’ve rambled for long enough, so I’ll end it here. Do any of you remember The Ace of Cups, Upward Bound, or that little red building where teens could go to play basketball? It was close to Emerson Elementary. 

Have a nice night y’all and thanks for listening to my stories. ",3,1736140456.0,ProjectCairo,0,1.0,False

Wow. Do I have a lot to tell you. 

Yesterday was a pivotal point in my relationship. There had been a chasm wrought between A and I. We both felt it, as though we were on different pages.

It started in the morning. He spoke to me, in a monologue that he feels unwanted by me, unconsidered + that he doesn’t even know why he’s here. I felt, in response, defensive and I shut down immediately. I could not connect or empathise with him when I was on the defence. I just felt that I had done a terrible wrong by him and he was angry with me.

The following loneliness I have not felt in a long time. I felt like the entire world was apart from me, including the person I was closest to. 

He left to give me space. I cried and cried. I was so hateful towards myself and I began spiralling. I considered the idea of drinking, although it didn’t seem that appetising. I more heavily considered cutting myself. But ultimately I didn’t want A to hude his feelings from me for fear of how I would respond. It felt manipulative, so I didn’t.

I did drink coffee. 3 or 4 coffees, I enjoyed them. We texted, I felt all was forgiven, until he came back.

It was in his face, his body, the way he moved. All I could see was stoniness, unsmiling, cold. As if he didn’t like me at all. It really put me on edge and hurt my feelings. 

We spoke for hours. And by the end of that conversation, his demeanour and look had transformed. To me, he looked like a different person entirely, like the person I loved. 

He told me he hadn’t been feeling like himself. Our thoughts and feelings strangely mirrored each others. And I felt my soul exhale in relief.

It was but a simple misunderstanding. The efforts he had made to connect to me were not recognised or felt to the degree that he had wanted. I did not connect in that way - through acts of service and doing nice things. In the ways he showed. 

I connected through emotional safety, through conversation. What he was doing was appreciated, but not a way for me to connect on a deeper level.

We came back to each other. We finally feel like us again.

I also thought that he was reading what I wrote here, due to various coincidences. It was strange to feel because I know how unyielding his moral compass is, and I knew it was unlike him to pry into my private space. He had not. It was simply a matter of coincidence, bizarre and beautiful coincidence.

I think now I am afraid to lose this connection. Afraid to mess up. But I also am relieved to feel the strength and ease I felt before.

Also. I drank coffee again today and it made me incredibly ill. So I want to remember that.

All yours, my friend.

My brother-in-law's partner, who also owns a Gen 2 and was using mine regularly for a week when visiting, expected a 4-5 setting for pourover. He was pretty confident that mine was grinding finer than his, which he has owned for months.

I read that it takes about 10 lbs of coffee for the burrs to adjust (I'm at about 5 so far) but would it really jump 7 levels to match the suggested setting?

I've already tried calibrating the grinder as per the online video, no change on behavior.

At this point I feel like my only options are to ask for new burrs, or return the grinder.

Any pointers?

I can't even fathom how the rest of the combo plays out. I know a drink is involved, and possibly a doughnut that they've only used in clinical trials. Another reliable source reported that their local Dunkin' Donuts went as far to call the cops on them before they obliged with the rare and treasured ""Tom Brady Special"". This source also confirmed that they got it at no cost. 

I have to blow the whistle on this. I have to urge you all to ask your local Dunkin' Donuts for the Tom Brady special. This has been ignored by the FBI, FTC, CIA, PTA, and USDA. I have been banned from the town of Wiscasset and there is a pending restraining order being requested by a specific district that cannot be named. The Attorney General keeps sending me to voicemail.

Momma tries her best, but in the end, she never wins. It's always daddy. I try not to cry as I here momma cry. Daddy must have hit her. I've gotten used to this kind of stuff, so only one or two tears come out. But I can hear Daddy approaching my room. And he's angry. I would usually try and block the door, but I've found that only makes the whipping last longer in the end. So instead, I hide today. Daddy would find me. He always did. I was merely delaying the inevitable. I here my door slam open. Daddy always slams the door when he's angry. I here him looking around my room, rummaging my stuff. I hold back a sob as he crumbles a drawing I made more mommy. Oh well. I can make more. I listen for mommy. Usually she falls asleep after she argues with daddy, although I find it always a little weird that she sleeps on the floor instead of in bed.  The closet door flings open. Daddy grabs me and pushes me against the wall. I hold back yelps of excruciating pain as the belt hits my skin like a blade. After a while, though, he stops yelling, and leaves the room. This is when I cry. When daddy leaves, it's okay to cry. You don't cry around daddy.

The next morning, I eat breakfast like I usually do. But I can't find mommy anywhere. I look around everywhere, but there's no sign of her. She must be at work. Daddy is on the couch watching TV, his drink sitting on a side-table. I build up the courage to ask him where mommy is. He doesn't answer. Maybe he can't hear me. I walk towards him and ask again. The moment I do this, he bolts up and screams at me so loud it makes me shiver. ""STOP CALLING ME DADDY LITTLE CRAP! GO TO YOUR ROOM UNLESS YOU WANT A WHIPPING! ASK ME AGAIN AND I'LL KILL YOU! I'LL KILL YOU! GET OUT OF MY FACE, YOU DUMB STUPID MIDGET!"", and daddy just kept yelling these mean things at me over and over. I sucked it up, though. Daddy gets angry when he drinks his coffee. I run to my room and sit in my bed. I hear daddy going to his room. He's grabbing the belt. *No, no. Not again*. I run to my room and hide under my bed. *He won't find me this time*, I think. But daddy would find me. He always did.

I lie in bed, thinking about all the angry things daddy said to me yesterday. I try not to think too hard about it. Daddy get's angry when he has his coffee. I still haven't seen mommy. Usually she'd be back by now, but maybe she has to work an extra shift or something. It's early morning, and as I sit in bed, I hear footsteps coming to my room. *Maybe mommy's back*! I think. I run to the door just as daddy comes in. He's carrying a doggy cage in one of his hands. *Are we getting a doggy*?! I think excitedly. But when he opens the cage door, no doggy comes out. ""Get in"", daddy says. I'm confused. I'm no doggy. Is he maybe talking about a doggy behind me? I check, but it's just me and him in the room. ""GET IN THE CAGE YOU STUPID CHILD!"", he yells, the walls rattling. He's angry. I would usually try and hide, but this time, he's in my room. He would know exactly where I am. I hardly have any time to react before he shoves me in the kennel, locking the cage door. ""Daddy, let me out! I don't like this joke!"", I say. ""This is no joke"", He said. I try and calm down, thinking happy thoughts. This must be part of the joke. He puts me down in the living room. The doggy cage is so small. It's hard to breathe. ""Now you can't cause trouble, you little pest. Now you can't do stupid things!"". Daddy sounds so angry. I squirm. I keep telling him I think the joke is funny, if he can let me out now. He doesn't flinch.

It's been a week in the doggy cage, and daddy still hasn't let me out. I haven't seen mommy. He only let's me have a little water at a time. I haven't eaten anything yet. My stomach grumbles. I stopped crying the first day after daddy yelled at me for doing so. This was my life now. I've gotten used to it. If I think real hard, I can be wherever I want. Free. Happy. I smile from time to time. Cry sometimes, too. But only when daddy is not around. Because you don't cry when daddy is around.

The front door bursts open as tons of big guys with guns charge into my house. Daddy is in his room. One of the men comes up, and sort of gasps when they see me. I must look pretty ugly, I think. Mommy bathes me, and since I've been in here and she's been gone, I haven't been washed off. ""It's okay, kid. Where going to get you out of here"", he says. He unlocks the kennel door and pulls me out, carrying me on his shoulders. I take in a big gasp of air. It feels so much more open out of the cage! I see daddy being pushed out of the room, chains on his hand. He looks angry. I want to ask what's going on, but I know daddy will get angry. The man carrying me answers the question for me, though. ""We've gotten a call from some neighbors that there's been some major abuse in this household. We're getting you out of here and to safety, little girl. Don't you worry"". I'm not sure what ""abuse"" means, but it sounds like a naughty word. As I'm carried out of the apartment, I see daddy being pushed into a black car, two armed men getting in alongside him. I'm carried in a car too, but get to ride up front. I giggle as I think about how jealous daddy might be that I get the front seat instead of him, but then frown as I think about the round of yelling and whipping I'd get for making a remark like that. ""Do you know where my mommy is, mister?"", I ask the man driving. He looks over at me, an odd expression on his face. He looks sort of... sad. ""She's left to live with the angels"", he says. I think about that. These angels sound nice. ""Can I meet the angels too?"", I ask. He glances over at me. ""Not yet, sweetie. Not yet..."".",1,1736139900.0,Horror_stories,1,1.0,False

today is your birthday.

For twenty years I thought of it, always, in advance--

that year we threw our party being the highlight of my anxious preoccupation

with your happiness...

or maybe, it was four years ago, 

when you stopped responding to my texts about your present, delivered on-time in the ice

to push guilt like dry cake

down my throat.

But this year

on the first

I erased your google reminder, biting my tongue, feeling the blood float

into the back of my mouth

And I swallowed it

just like I am swallowing how relieved I feel

not to have to call you

not to displease you in some way unforeseen, heart always fumbling

I swallowed the guilt I feel

about being one of your failures

I swallow the remaining love I have

for your beautiful eyes, mint and coffee in your sweet face, that dimple you could take a bath in

you are a beautiful girl, honey

But you're not the one for me.

Everything tastes bitter.

But this is the purgatory I chose

rather than the one you liked to put me in, a lion pit of passive-aggressive text messages

your voice on the phone, threaded with tears

because I did it wrong.

I was always doing it wrong.

And maybe today you were relieved not to hear from me, too.

That's what I'm telling myself

As I swallow the copper of my blood

And blow you a kiss

Mind you this was a weekday morning which is when we are busiest. People are constantly coming in to get fountain drinks. But I knew someone had said something to my manager because my manager started treating me like an idiot. 

Well someone told me yesterday that, again after I was long gone, the toilet paper was low in the bathroom. She then yelled ""WHAT THE FUCK DOES SHE DO BESIDES SIT THERE AND CROCHET ALL NIGHT!"" First of all, I'm too tired for hobbies. Secondly, the toilet paper was full when I cleaned the bathrooms. It isn't my fault if people use the bathroom after I stock it.

My district manager said that everyone should be stocking the cooler on their shift, my coworker told her that since overnight shift is alone all night they can't just take an hour to stock the cooler and leave the store alone. My shitty coworker then said ""well she thinks she can lock the door for everything else idk why she can't lock it to stock the cooler."" I got permission from our manager to lock the doors when I (1) use the bathroom and (2) mop/ clean the bathrooms. That's all I lock the doors for. I don't think it's unreasonable that I use that to my advantage so I can get shit done. The reason why SHE can't is because she LOCKED HERSELF OUT OF THE STORE. 

The grates for the drinks and coffee machines are supposed to be cleaned every night by the second shift. Of course most of the time they do not do this. I have my own work to worry about, so no I won't be doing their job for them. My shit coworker complained about ME not doing it. She blamed me right off the bat, not second shift. My good coworker asked her if she does another shifts job for them if they don't do it. She replied ""no they should have done it when they worked."" But *I* have to do another shifts job because apparently I'm not busy at night. 

She says all this shit about me, but I was the one covering her shifts when she was in jail for a month and a half. I was working 50 hours a week to cover her ass. 

I'm not the only one she talks shit about either, but my coworker told me ""when I say she's on your dick, I mean she's on YOUR dick."" So you know what, I'm finding another job as soon as possible and I'm gonna tell her how awful she is to work with. I'm sick of working with childish people.

I'm planning to start a 14 day fast in the next week to reset my health after having a few months of up and downs with my health journey. I've been cleaning up my diet/lifestyle over the past few months but I'm finding myself being tempted back into old habits and having cravings for junk food and alcohol after years of being in the habit of having an after-work ""treat"". Until 7pm rolls around I eat a clean diet and the back and forth has been frustrating.

I've completed a 7 day fast before and it helped me quit smoking so I can attest to the power of fasting for breaking cravings/addictions. I want to push it to 14 days this time to really reset those addiction pathways, give my gut a good rest, trim down some excess fat and get a good period of autophagy to clean up some of the damage my lifestyle has been inflicting on my body.

On my previous fasts, I've stuck to mostly water, a variety of teas, ACV, lemon water and occasionally coffee for energy in the first few days but I'm not much of a coffee drinker. And I'll be adding electrolytes and multivitamins along the way. I'm unsure about the efficacy of probiotic tablets whilst doing longer fasts and my understanding is that fibre is needed for it to be effective. 

As this'll be my first time attempting 14 days I look forward to sharing my journey. Any tips appreciated :)",3,1736138016.0,fasting,1,1.0,False

1huqt07,https://www.reddit.com/r/umanitoba/comments/1huqt07/seeking_insights_abt_what_i_did_wrong_to_navigate/,Seeking insights abt what I did wrong to navigate this system,"To those taking a second degree students, I am seeking insights to help me out this trap. 

I am devasted. One year and a half is completely wasted at uofm, when I am supposed to graduate from a second degree about two and a half year. I did prepared money for a degree, but not all the endless hazards, and all the money and time I devoted just in vain. I would appreciate some one could help point out what I did wrong? Should I quit? I just want to get a degree to make a living so in the future I can be financially independent to pursue sociology and literature. 

Before coming to Canada, a student advisor provided a second degree course plan with 63 credits to finish. Among these, two prerequisite courses required before declaring a major. 

I arrived in Canada the second half of the summer term and started with Prerequisite Course 1. However, registration for the following fall and winter terms began before the prerequiste course being completed. When my registration window was open, the first CS prerequisite course (Course A — comp 1020) in the fall, was already full with 200 students on the waitlist in the fall, and around 170 in the winter. It meant that there was no chance to declare cs major. The consequence was no chance to register any cs courses for winter term. So as an international student, being here after one and a half year, i still could not take any cs courses, even though it is the main reason I came here. I would have to take useless electives — not leading to complete a second degree — wasting a whole academic year.

I did not back off. I figured using Prerequisite Course 1 to declare math and cs major, succeed in declaring a major. In the meantime, I got a LOP to take some “fake” course from Athbasca then transfered it to uofm to waive the course impossible to get — Course A. This helped me get to register one cs 2000 level course for winter term. 

Unfortunately, the online course didn’t provide the foundation required for the 2000 level course (i am not the only one think it this way), and I failed the winter course. Even if I had passed that second-year course (let’s call it Course a), I would still be stuck in the summer term. 

The summer term is divided into two parts, offering courses a, b, and c. Course c requires both a AND b as prerequisites, but all these courses are offered simultaneously in the first half part. So even if I completed Course b, I couldn’t take Course c because it ends alongside Course b. I still couldn’t progress further.

Failing the course and finding no support left me devastated. When I approached CS course TA, he only addressed questions related to the course and said things like, “I can’t teach you the whole course.” Adding to this, the winter was harsh. Social isolation, my landlord limiting heating, and a bus transfer point with a shelter having no wind shelf glasses, not to mention heating. These all made things even harder. After the summer, I took a break to rest.

Following this break, I transferred to Data Science before this fall term. This allowed me to register for math and stats courses while still having some CS courses. The prerequisites I had completed also transferred. However:

1. I still couldn’t register for Course A because the waitlist remained full.

2. Transferring to Data Science added several extra courses to my workload (confirmed by an advisor).

This fall, I took one math course and two statistics courses. Social isolation continued, and my situation worsened. Additionally, during the luteal phase, hormonal fluctuations caused severe depression. I relied on high volumn of coffee during the day to stay awake and overdosed on melatonin at night to sleep. Overdosing caused me to wake up with chest pain (angina), which worsened over time. I had anxiety-related tightness or emptiness in my chest before i came here, so I assumed this was normal given the stress of life here. I didn’t realize the chest pain was caused by melatonin. 

My doctor and counselor didn’t suspect this either. Besides the angina, I woke up groggy, with cognitive freezing, making it impossible to attend school. I barely made it to school this term. Until reading week, I got to rest fully. Then, during ovulation, a few hours after egg release, the sky was completely cleared for me — my brain could function again. Only then did I realize my severe depression was due to PMS, and I quickly scheduled a doctor’s appointment.

As for the angina, I only recently find out it was caused by melatonin. On the three occasions I didn’t take it, I woke up peacefully. This realization came too late. Due to these physical issues, I missed the finals for two core courses and thus couldn’t take third-year courses for the winter term, as I lacked prerequisites.

In summary, after completing this winter term, I still have 63 credits left, despite having already completed six courses which were supposed to lead to graduation. Also half of my saving has gone for the 5 terms of tution, though nothing leading to complete a degree. 

  
Thank you all in advance.

We have a daughter so I didn't want to leave immediately. We went out for dinner and her affair partner was there with his wife. He got scared that we would make a scene so while his wife was outside he ran to us to say that his wife didn't know. I asked ""is that your wife?"", when he said yes I laughed and asked him if he was mental to cheat on someone like her. The wife is literally drop dead gorgeous. My wife became furious and she yelled all the way home about what I meant. I told her I said what I said. Only a sick bastard would cheat on that lady. My ex wife asked for divorce by then, and she ended up telling the other woman.

She contacted me a few weeks ago. She left her husband. She probably wanted to know if I was oblivious. We ended up chatting for a while. Then we met for coffee. This woman is as kind and sweet as she is beautiful. My head is full of her. Is it wrong to try my luck or does it seem weird. I mean we are not related in anyway. My wife and I have been separated for 6 months but really the marriage ended about a year ago when I found out.

1huqs5x,https://i.redd.it/u93cglxqwabe1.jpeg,Day trading for fun,"Hey guys,
So, even though I took most of my resources off xeggex back to BTC I left myself a $22 float yesterday morning and had an idea of seeing what I could do with it during this crazy run of events.
So I put it in on a low spike which got me roughly 30000 coins and then during the course of the day, which included a 3 hour drive when I couldn’t trade, I bought the lows, conservatively sold at top out points and bought back in all the way through to early hours in which I tried to catch several Timezone markets. The Japanese one by the way happens to be big volumes for those that are interested, I digress anyway, I got up in time to catch the drop to .00040 after exiting at .00054 and then through several coffees, bought and sold my position to 170000 coins at which point I exited at .00047 after another buy in at .00041. Thus netting a 4x gain to $84 and it kept me very engaged from my hot tub trading position, 😂
Now, this is small fry compared to the whales, I’m a tadpole, but I’ll continue on with this process today until I get to my exit goal I set myself of $150, will leave a $30 float, put another $120 into BTC and go again. It’s fun and quite a relaxing way to spend the holidays. And just for info, I have 8 projects like this on the go with roughly similar positions on each, just that at low levels it’s a relatively reduced risk when one tanks. 
And for anyone who dm’s me, don’t expect an answer, i don’t even bother with messages.
I had to adjust my buy sell points through the chaos but as that was now an expectation, it wasn’t an inconvenience.
I’ve got enough capital to run at more funding, but I’d rather accumulate.
Holders keep holding, your doing a great job 👏 
Just a pity your financial positions were much healthier 48hours ago.

During one of my phone calls with my parents we were in a heated argument where I devolved into screaming and crying. I threw a coffee mug across the room and shattered it. They called the police on me for a wellness check (it was humiliating). 
My dad called my sister (who is my roommate) to tell her all of the gritty details of our phone conversation. He then warned my sister to lock her door at night; the implication here seems obvious to me.

My sister is trying to use this as grounds to evict me from our apartment (which isn’t even legal because I co-signed on the lease). She says that, per what our dad has said, living with me is unsafe (I have no criminal history and I have never been violent to her or anyone else. The only danger I pose is to myself because I have struggled with s*icidality.) 

I am deeply offended that my dad has told my sister to lock her door at night. In my mind, this is akin to calling me a latent violent criminal. His words have given my roommate leverage to try and kick me out.
I’m wondering if this counts as slander and if there is legal action I can take, or if it’s just a family drama and nothing more.

I think me and my husband (or just me alone) would be a great fit for this show. We are two people who definitely love and depend on our things. I was raised in a broken home, and my things have always meant the world to me since I've had so little. They have been my security blanket (quite literally.. I have slept with the same teddy bear since I've been 7). At any rate it would be interesting to see how I do without them.

Application Submitted 05/13/2016 09:24 pm: Hi there, My name is John Yates and I think I would be a great fit for this because I believe I have an amazing story to tell. In a nutshell, When I was born, my Italian born father never believed I was his son and beat me... from when I wan an infant until I was forcibly removed by other family members (he had broken my nose, threw me down a flight of stairs - all before age 5). My sister never got touched...she looked just like him. Around the age of 6 my mother finally had the balls to kick him out, but was replaced with friends of my mothers who did drugs with her. I would watch my mother and about 5 guys do cocaine on our coffee table every night. They in turn, beat me too. When my grandparents took me away my mother fell into a deep drug fueled depression from which she never recovered. She committed suicide when I turned 9 - I was separated from my father and sister - I've probably seen them 5 times my entire life). Everything was ok until I was 16 and guess what...I'm gay, and my ultraconservative religious grandparents kick me out. I was on the honor roll, captain of the tennis team, and now a homeless gay teen in the cold winter of NY and I have been on my own ever since. I managed to do okay I think... I was valedictorian of my college class, captain of the men's NCAA tennis team. I've also in the last 10 years lost my grandmother and 5 aunts to cancer so its just me and my husband. Please give me the chance to tell my story, I have been waiting my whole life for an outlet. There is so much more. I'm 37 but still get carded for alcohol. I am from Long Island, NY, and again, if you give me this opportunity, I promise you will have one amazing story.

Application Submitted 05/13/2016 10:22 pm: I would love for my rival to be my ex Brian. He always flaunts his better life and id love to stick it to him, and not in that way.

They say opposites attract, and they were right because we've been together for 8 years and married for 5.

Its been great to see all the valuable discussions going on here. Learnt a ton. Here is my 2024 recap and as always , would welcome your thoughts/comments/support! Sorry for long post.

  
DISK household (Myself and spouse are 40YO, 7YO kid)  

Assets

* Household Gross Income: $295K base salary total + $110-140K annual bonus/RSUs
* Retirement Accounts (401k, 403b, Roth IRA): $700k
* Non-Retirement Brokerage/Investments (Brokerage, VUL..) : $180K
* Cash: $100K (most in HYSA u/4.1%)
* College 529: $104K (In 2035 aiming for 4yr private college - tuition, room, books..etc)

Liabilities

* Home: $420K mortgage left @ 2.99% (home valued at 700k-800k, primary residence)
* 2024 annual expenses: $164k (including mortgage, credit card expenses etc)
   * $40K mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA
   * $20K travel/vacations (2-3 international trips, 2-3 domestic trips)
   * $17K Restaurants/Bars/Coffee Shops
   * $10k Groceries/Meal Kits
   * $25K Shopping - Electronics/Clothing/Amazon/ChristmasGifts

In 2025, some areas I think we need to improve on,

* ~~Contribute more towards 529 Plan -  max out 20K for state tax benefits in 2025~~ Done
* Lower Annual spend by $30K - reduce from $164K to $134K
* Max out spouse 401K . Currently she is not contributing towards 401K, only doing annual $4k Roth contribution but that seems like a missed opportunity for us, even though I'm maxing out my retirement accounts annually ($23K 401k + $7K roth IRA backdoor conversion + $10K Roth mega backdoor conversion)
* Anything else I'm missing?

FIRE thoughts in my head,

* My personal goal is to FIRE in some shape/form by the time I become empty nester in 10 years when I reach 50 years old
* If I can make sure our net income ($164k) is > = our annual spend ($164k), do I have enough to coast FIRE until I'm 60?
* Seems like based on $164K annual expenses , our FIRE number is $4M which seems incredibly high/far away, so will need to find a way to bring it down by trying to reduce expenses during retirement
* Expat Fire seems like a good way for me to achieve goals in a more cost effective way and get some warmer weather
   * Want to live somewhere money can go long way - Mexico City or tier-2 city in India are top of my mind. I can see myself spending 4-6 months in winter in Mexico/India soon after my kid leaves to college (if I can afford to make it work)

   * On other side, I'm grateful to have wonderful family, US citizenship and chubby lifestyle. We have non-tech childhood friends that barely getting by today (even requesting gofundme donations) let alone planning for retirement. I know that no matter what, I'm at a point where I will not be homeless/penny-less, my child will not have to struggle during her childhood. Its a privilege to even be in the situation I'm in
* Depressions and anxiety are still concern for me. Spend my day taking afternoon naps and don't feel like working during the day, almost like I'm waiting to be fired/laid off to find an excuse to take sabbatical. I was under illusion that post-FIRE would solve those problems and I would have energy and excitement to follow some passion projects. I'm starting to realize that I need to find my passion projects now and pursue them now or else I'll just be even more depressed later given all the extra time I will have on my hands. ironically, my passion is standup comedy or be PM career coach so I want to pursue standup comedy classes in 2025, and start mentoring some PM folks now.
* For as depressed as I am, I'm also making more money than ever before ($350K) so Im trying to make sure I get it together and keep my job so we can get to FIRE asap. I've seen folks job hunting 4-6 months and comp packages 20% lower than 2022 so I need to be careful not to screw myself.

This week Sam is joined by Sophie in Japan! Sam tried raw chicken and onions, reunited with an old friend over there, and fell off the wagon. Sophie busts Sam trying to elicit a giggle from Dud-man, reveals herself as the true puppet master, and brushed Samâs teeth for him. Next thing I know thereâs a tarantula of shots. The markers in Japan are âexceptionalâ. Chili Peppers out of a hot pot, squid, scallops, wet shrimp, there was slugs in it, and then a bunch of booze. An old bent man shoved Sam.

The packet I had definitely had no obvious indicator that would make me think to check for caffeine, but here I am at 11PM wide awake. Anyone have any idea how much caffeine could be in a serving?

Its been great to see all the valuable discussions going on here. Learnt a ton. Here is my 2024 recap and as always , would welcome your thoughts/comments/support! Sorry for long post.

  
DISK household (Myself and spouse are 40YO, 7YO kid)  

Assets

* Household Gross Income: $295K base salary total + $110-140K annual bonus/RSUs
* Retirement Accounts (401k, 403b, Roth IRA): $700k
* Non-Retirement Brokerage/Investments (Brokerage, VUL..) : $180K
* Cash: $100K (most in HYSA u/4.1%)
* College 529: $104K (In 2035 aiming for 4yr private college - tuition, room, books..etc)

Liabilities

* Home: $420K mortgage left @ 2.99% (home valued at 700k-800k, primary residence)
* 2024 annual expenses: $164k (including mortgage, credit card expenses etc)
   * $40K mortgage, taxes, insurance, HOA
   * $20K travel/vacations (2-3 international trips, 2-3 domestic trips)
   * $17K Restaurants/Bars/Coffee Shops
   * $10k Groceries/Meal Kits
   * $25K Shopping - Electronics/Clothing/Amazon/ChristmasGifts

In 2025, some areas I think we need to improve on,

* ~~Contribute more towards 529 Plan -  max out 20K for state tax benefits in 2025~~ Done
* Lower Annual spend by $30K - reduce from $164K to $134K
* Max out spouse 401K . Currently she is not contributing towards 401K, only doing annual $4k Roth contribution but that seems like a missed opportunity for us, even though I'm maxing out my retirement accounts annually ($23K 401k + $7K roth IRA backdoor conversion + $10K Roth mega backdoor conversion)
* Anything else I'm missing?

FIRE thoughts in my head,

* My personal goal is to FIRE in some shape/form by the time I become empty nester in 10 years when I reach 50 years old
* If I can make sure our net income ($164k) is > = our annual spend ($164k), do I have enough to coast FIRE until I'm 60?
* Seems like based on $164K annual expenses , our FIRE number is $4M which seems incredibly high/far away, so will need to find a way to bring it down by trying to reduce expenses during retirement
* Expat Fire seems like a good way for me to achieve goals in a more cost effective way and get some warmer weather

 Because I know you must be tired from walking around there all the time. 
I can tell that you don’t take the bus, you like to walk, you like to run. That much is obvious, like fire on the sun. 
So come take a drink with me. 
We’ll walk around the city talking about bees and trees because all I want is to look at you, as you look at me.
Look at this brown boy bleed. 
Watch us run amuck in the back of an ambulance truck trying to find the place where we lost our spot in line. I wonder these things about you. You’re the kind of woman that governs the mind.
