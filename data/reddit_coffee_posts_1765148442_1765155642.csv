This is all fine at home since he can do a lot of things himself and we have kind of figured out how to accommodate different parts of our routine. He go up and down stairs, he’ll likely take naps on mattress on the floor like at daycare, eat at the coffee table in the living room etc.

My biggest thing is figuring out how to get him in/out of a car seat, mostly to attend daycare which he has 3 days a week. I’d like to keep him going so he doesn’t have too much disruption in his routine with a new sibling in the house and so I can spend one on one time with the new baby…so how can I get him in and out safely? There’s a possibility I can have my sister in law help but we really don’t have much help nearby.

Life doesn’t always stay warm and comfortable. Sometimes things change and everything feels different, just like when hot coffee turns cold.

At first you might not like it. It feels strange and unexpected. But if you give it a moment you see that cold coffee has its own taste. Life is the same. When plans change or people move away, it can feel uncomfortable, but slowly you learn new habits and new strength.

Cold coffee shows that change isn’t bad. It’s just a new flavor. You can still enjoy it in a different way.

Ive been an tattooer full time for 4 years now and i realised that most pf the problems that people have with us are due to either: lack of research, not standing up for yourself or simply not knowing what they want.
I have this analogy with ordering a coffee that will help u approach tattooing in a much easier way from now on.

1- You would never order an item from a different restaurant than the one ur in, right? different recipe, different chef, different flavour it never comes out right

2- Dont watch over ur barista 100% of the time when shes making ur coffee, let ur barista focus and make u the best capuccino and wait for ur name to be called

3- Dont bargain for ur coffee, nobody likes that guy

4- You don't walk into a café, demand a custom drink that isnt on the menu, change it five times, and then say youll ""think about it."" you look at the menu, choose what u want, trust them to make it.

5- Like coffee, tattoos are better when u trust the person making it, ur barista knows their beans and your tattooer knows their craft. relax, communicate clearly, and let the homie do what u came here for

6- You would never ask a barista to ""just whip something up so I can see if I like it."" so dont go around asking for full mock ups or concept art before committing to an appointment, to earn full control of a tattoo, u gotta drop moola for it, a tattooers time working should be payed for, the same as any other job.

7- You dont bring ur whole fucking family behind the counter with you, same in the shop, bring one support person max. It's not a movie

8- You dont panic if your coffee is too hot right away, you let it cool, so don't panic in the first few days of healing, relax, be kind to yourself and ask ur artist for help if anything happens.

theres more parallels but im gonna cap here, dont forget that a good tattoo appointment starts by researching a good tattoo artist, take as much of ur time with the artist research as you would take time thinking of ur design.

next time ur unsure on how to go about ur tattoo appointment, trace a parallel with ur favourite service industry and there you go, this is not our hobby, we are here to provide a service with love and care, give respect and support and you shall get it back <3",2,1765154977.0,tattooadvice,1,0.67,False

I’ve recently treated myself to a K-Ultra & have noticed my brew time jump in my first week of ownership! I’m averaging just over 5 min total brew time at a setting of 8.5-9 on the K-Ultra, which is up significantly from my previous ~3.5 min with the 1Zpresso Jx, with same recipe, equipment, & beans. I calibrated the K-Ultra out the box according to website’s instructions. 

Recipe: 15 G coffee, 240mL filtered water @ 95C, 4 pours: 50-60-60-70 
Brewer: Orea v4 w/ “fast” bottom
Filters: Orea flat (non-Sibarist), even tried Kalita wave paper with same results

Tried doing some digging & found a few people mention their K-Ultra produced more fines in the first month - so wondering how common this experience is.

The coffee doesn’t taste terrible, but I feel like a 5+ min brew when I’m already at the courser end of what’s I’ve seen mentioned (anywhere from 6.5-8.5) leaves me wondering what might be going on ~ 

Appreciate any insight or guidance!

Sciatic nerve pain is an monster!! 

 I have been sleeping in my powerwheel chair, because laying down is the worst position to try and sleep in during a flair up. 

Last night I put my head towards the foot of the bed, and placed both of my legs against the wall. The relief was instant. 
I grabbed my phone and started playing games. I fell asleep. Uninterrupted sleep. 

Usually, with a flair up, in the mornings my back is so stiff and sore. I have to crawl  into a hot shower just to get some movement. 

This morning, I walked to the bathroom like a lady, did my pee pee, washed my hands walked into the kitchen, got my coffee started, then got in the shower  before I realized I wasn't in pain.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pgyofw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgyofw,"Hello everyone, as someone who had a lot of questions before traveling, I will tell you about my trip because I also had some questions on my mind about certain topics before the trip. Feel free to ask me if you want.","First of all, the Thai people were wonderful.
On October 14, I flew to Bangkok with Gulf Air via Bahrain and landed in Bangkok on the morning of October 15. This route takes about 13 hours from Turkey. The immigration officer didn't ask any questions to tourists in front of me who didn't speak English and couldn't communicate, but she asked me where I would be staying and for my return ticket. I don't know what procedure would have been followed if I hadn't had a return ticket.
I was traveling alone, but I had a few friends I met through apps (Tinder, Boo, etc.) in Thailand, and one of them picked me up. Even so, I felt like a stranger when I landed, which is totally normal. I bought a SIM card with 15 days of unlimited internet at the airport for 700 baht (TrueMove) and had no problems. Before even checking into the hotel, I got a two-hour massage at a salon recommended by my friend, and it felt great after the layover flight (highly recommended).
On the first day, I stayed at Ramada by Sukhumvit 87, located on Sukhumvit 87, on my friend's recommendation.
I paid $50 per night during the low season, and it was really great.
In terms of location, it's 5 minutes from Onnut BTS, with a 7-Eleven and restaurants right next to the hotel. The area is lively and safe. I was so satisfied with the cleanliness and comfort that I stayed at the same hotel for 5 more days.
On the second day, I visited the temples and Chinatown. Chinatown was very crowded as usual, but if you like Asian cuisine, it's a great place for you.
At night, I went to the Octave rooftop bar and a place called Find Locker Room, which has a hidden entrance but is perfect inside. Octave is a classic rooftop bar, but I recommend the bar called Find Locker Room to everyone. The bartenders really know their stuff; tell them what you like, and they will prepare perfect cocktails for you. Cocktail prices are $12-15 USD at both bars.
The next day, I went to an above-average restaurant to try Thai cuisine, but unfortunately, as someone eating it for the first time, I couldn't get used to it (I hope I can enjoy it on my next trip).
I had dinner on one of the boats that offer river tours. It was nothing special for someone who has the opportunity to have dinner on the Bosphorus in Istanbul, but I enjoyed it.I had a few beers while waiting for the boat and continued drinking beer during dinner on the boat.
When I got back to my room that night, I started vomiting and having diarrhea like I'd never experienced before in my life.Even if I drank water, I would throw it up 15 seconds later.I slept shivering until morning.
I went straight to a pharmacy in the morning (I work as a paramedic) and got some medicine we use in Turkey. After taking the medicine, my diarrhea stopped. I think I was probably poisoned by the ice they put in the beer on the boat tour. Unfortunately, this situation also ruined my street food tour planned for the following days. And since I had planned to go to Koh Samui and Khao Sok that morning, my Surat Thani flight ticket went to waste. I stayed with my Thai friend for the next two days. She took me on a day trip to Ratchaburi in her car. I visited the temple inside the tree and the floating market. I also drank the most delicious and fresh coconut water I've ever had in Thailand at a market by the highway. It was only 20 baht.
The next morning at 6 AM, I flew to Chiang Mai (I flew with NOK Air and paid 35 USD). Chiang Mai became my favorite city in Thailand. I stayed at Astra Condo for two nights at 30 USD per night, but I wasn't very satisfied with the cleanliness, so I moved to Paraiso Hotel, where I paid 28 USD and was completely satisfied. In Chiang Mai, I visited all the temples in the old city starting in the morning and finished within 8 hours. Walking everywhere felt great. I sat in some of the temples, listened to myself, and questioned my life because the reason I started this trip was that my life had become unbearably stressful.
On the second day, I visited Wat Umong and Doi Suthep. If you have a driver's license, renting a motorbike is much better. I used Bolt, but most drivers don't accept to the price listed on the app.
I only had a massage twice in Bangkok, but in Chiang Mai, I had maybe 11-12 massages in total. Please get plenty of massages. You can get a good hamburger menu for 300 baht at Rock Me Burger on Loi Kroh Road, and you can get good cocktails at the bar about 300 meters to the right (it's not a bar with women, so you'll easily recognize it). I got an oil massage at a massage parlor on the same street without knowing the procedure, and when I went into the room (it was a place with 4-5 side-by-side beds), the woman who was going to give me the massage told me I had to take off my underwear. It turned out to be a massage parlor with a happy ending, and when I said I didn't want that, she went and had a 60-year-old woman in the shop give me the massage, and at the end, she didn't give me back the 100 baht change she said she would.Gentlemen, ladies, of course 100 baht isn't a lot of money, but it showed me that Thai people working in nightlife aren't very trustworthy. There are exceptions, of course.
By the way, I recommend you try the coffee and tea in Thailand, which are very tasty and cheap. The next day, I set out to hike the monk trail and reached the main temple in a quiet and peaceful manner. Walking through the forest was enjoyable, but there is an abandoned temple along the way that you follow by following the signs, and it was a nightmare for me. It was very difficult for me, who was already tired, to climb 500-600 meters with no other tourists in the dense forest. The Bolt driver also mentioned dangerous animals (snakes, spiders, etc.) in the forest, which heightened my fears at that moment. I wouldn't recommend going alone because you might think you'll never get out of that forest, but the temple was enjoyable.
In the evening, I got an offer for a massage at home from a ladyboy (hope she dont fuck me  hahaha). It was the best massage I've ever had, but it wasn't what I expected. She didn't do prostitution because she worked at a spa center. By the way, guys, HIV is a reality.
I flew back to Bangkok and stayed with a friend I met in Chiang Mai for two more days. I had five days left and was very anxious about where to go. I made the worst decision for myself and went to Krabi(with air asia paid totally 80 usd). I wish I had gone to Pattaya or Rayong instead. I was very prejudiced against Pattaya, Im sorry . I stayed at the Ao Nangt B2 Premier Hotel. It was a normal hotel for $30, but having to do everything with a tour and be with selfish tourists who think they're better than everyone else turned me off. We all know tourists can be categorized by their personalities... I'm sure Koh Samui would have been a better choice, but if your country doesn't have beach tourism, you'll love this place too. I only stayed for one day and returned to Bangkok. I went to the Chatuchak Night Market for souvenirs, but it wasn't worth seeing that crowd. Instead, I recommend going to the Mixt mall next door during the day for standard souvenirs. Thailand is very safe. I walked around at night in Chiang Mai, where it was very obvious I was a tourist, and nothing happened to me except for kindness (they offered to take me back to my hotel on their motorbike).
Only in Chinatown, two Chinese men tried to open the bag on my back as they approached from behind, but when they realized I noticed, they denied it and walked away. My German tourist friend next to me said they were Chinese, not Thai. Actually, it's still safe, hahaha.
I'm sorry I couldn't write the post as planned. If you have any questions for me, I'd be happy to answer them. Thank you. On my next trip, I'll also visit Koh Samui, Khao Sok, Pattaya, and Rayong.",2,1765154829.0,ThailandTourism,0,1.0,False

1pgyml6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgyml6,Thinking of Partnering Instead of Selling My Food Trailer — What Do You Think?,"Thinking of Partnering Instead of Selling My Food Trailer — What Do You Think?

Hey everyone,

I posted here recently asking whether I should keep trying with my food trailer business or just walk away, and I really appreciated all the honest feedback. After reading all your replies, I walked away with two main takeaways:
	1.	Some of you said I shouldn’t have bought a food trailer without prior experience and that selling it might be the best way out.
And honestly — I agree with you. If I could go back, I probably wouldn’t make the same decision. It was a big leap with a lot of unknowns. But I’m already here. The trailer is fully permitted, I have a commissary, and everything legally required is in place. I’ve only gone out twice so far and it wasn’t bad — but doing this completely alone is overwhelming.
	2.	Others encouraged me to stick with it and gain experience.
To those people — thank you. Your encouragement actually gave me some clarity.

⸻

So here’s an idea I had and I’d love opinions:

Instead of selling or burning myself out trying to run everything solo, I’m thinking about partnering with someone who has sandwich-making or deli experience.

The concept:
	•	They take charge of the sandwich side — supplies, prep, groceries, operations.
	•	They keep 100% of sandwich sales.
	•	We split fixed operating expenses 50/50 (generator gas, truck fuel, commissary fees, insurance, maintenance, etc.).
	•	We set up a simple contract trial — maybe 6 months, then month-to-month.

I would continue handling the drinks side — smoothies, juices, coffees, soft drinks — and keep that revenue.

The “partnership” is gonna be temporary maybe 1 and a half years while I learn everything to run things by myself and I already have my name out there

This way:
	•	I reduce my financial pressure by only covering half of the fixed costs,
	•	I keep the business alive and continue learning,
	•	I gain operational experience from someone who actually knows food prep,
	•	And they get access to a permitted trailer/business setup without the full initial investment.

⸻

I know some people will say, “Just do it all yourself and keep all the profits.”
But realistically, starting a food business when nobody knows you, while handling every task alone, and covering all costs up front, is too much for me.

So — what do you think about this partnership approach?
Has anyone done something similar?
Anything I should watch out for or structure differently?

Thanks again for all the advice — both the tough and encouraging parts. It really helped me think more clearly about my options.

Hey everyone. I am putting myself out there to meet new people and hopefully build some easy, genuine connections. I am mainly looking for friendship to start. Good conversations, shared interests, someone to laugh with and feel comfortable around. If things naturally grow into something more, I am definitely open to that as well.

A little about me:
I am 33, born and raised in Michigan. I enjoy anything outdoors during the warmer months. Hiking, kayaking, camping, random day trips, bonfires, and pretty much anything that gets me outside. Once winter arrives, I switch into a more relaxed, at home mode. I enjoy reading, watching good shows, drinking coffee, and just enjoying calm nights in with the right person.

Personality wise, I am friendly, laid back, and easy to talk to. Once I am comfortable with someone, I can be silly, sarcastic, and playful. I love to laugh and I enjoy people who do the same. I appreciate genuine and consistent communication without anything forced or awkward. Just two people getting to know each other at their own pace.

What I am hoping to find:
Someone who wants to talk, share stories, joke around, and build something real. Whether it becomes a solid friendship or turns into something deeper, I am open to either. I am not expecting anything instantly. I just want good energy and a natural connection with someone who is also looking for something meaningful.

I drove home with the radio off, half expecting his car to reappear in my rearview mirror. Every streetlight felt like a spotlight. Every shadow felt occupied. By the time I reached my apartment, my shirt was crusted with dried blood, and the bandage I slapped over my cheek wasn’t doing much.

I’ve dealt with violent men before. Abusers, stalkers, addicts having the worst night of their lives. They all have patterns, tiny giveaways that separate the dangerous from the pathetic. This man had none.

He wasn’t panicked.

He wasn’t improvising.

He was prepared.

I poured myself a drink I didn’t need and checked my phone. Three missed calls. One voicemail.

Marissa.

I let it sit for an hour before I listened to it. I don’t know why. Maybe part of me hoped the job would disappear if I ignored it long enough.

When I finally pressed play, her voice cracked straight through.

“Did you find anything?” she asked. No greeting. No hesitation. Her voice was different. Tight, like she’d been crying but didn’t have the luxury to finish.

“I just… I need to know if I’m crazy.”

Crazy? No. If anything, she was the sanest person in this entire situation.

I didn’t call her back. Not yet. I needed distance. Perspective. A plan.

But at 3:12 a.m., my phone buzzed again.

Not a call.

A text message.

From an unknown number.

Unknown:
Good evening, Alex. How’s the cheek?

My throat closed.

Another message arrived before I could finish reading the first.

Unknown:
Don’t make this me against you. I’m not your enemy. You’re lucky. I like your skillset. Consider this a… recruitment.

Recruitment.

The word made something deep inside me recoil.

A third message popped up.

Unknown:
Meet tomorrow. Noon. Same coffee shop. Sit where you sat with my wife. Don’t be late.

I stared at the phone for a long time, pulse pounding loud enough to hear. There was no question how he got my number. He’d planned for everything. He didn’t just anticipate someone following him. He’d prepared for it.

I didn’t sleep. I just watched the night melt into morning while my cheek throbbed like a reminder carved into my face.

At 11:58 a.m., I walked into the coffee shop. Same bell. Same smell of burnt espresso and old books. The same barista who didn’t recognize me, which somehow made this feel even more surreal.

He was already there.

Sitting in the same booth Marissa had sat in, like he’d swapped seats in some grotesque game of musical chairs. His posture was immaculate. Relaxed. Polished. Like he belonged here and I didn’t.

“Alex” he said, smiling like we were old friends.

There was no knife this time.

That somehow scared me more.

I sat.

He slid a folder across the table.

Thin. My name written on the tab.

“Before you open it” he said softly, “let’s establish two things.”

He held up one finger.

“One: If I wanted you dead, we wouldn’t be speaking right now.”

A second finger.

“Two: You’re not here because you followed me. You’re here because I let you.”

My pulse spiked.

He nodded at the folder. “Go ahead.”

I hesitated, then opened it.

My address.

Photos of my car.

A copy of my PI license.

A picture of me at my sister’s house two weeks ago, from an angle that meant he’d been close.

Too close.

He watched me process it, his expression calm and analytical, like he was studying how I reacted to fear.

“You’re a spectator, Alex” he said. “You spend your life documenting other people’s secrets. That’s what makes you useful. That’s what makes you interesting.”

His voice lowered, almost conversational.

“But sooner or later, every spectator has to choose a side.”

He leaned forward. I didn’t move.

“Tell me, Alex… did you hear the music last night?”

My mouth went dry. I didn’t answer.

His smile widened, not friendly, not warm. Pleased.

“You think you heard a victim” he whispered. “But you didn’t. You heard a transformation.”

A chill slid down my spine.

“What do you mean?”

He sat back, humming that same classical melody under his breath. The same one from the storage unit. The same one he’d bled into my dreams all night.

When he spoke again, it was barely audible.

“You’re going to help me pick the next one.”

My heart stopped.

“The next what?”

He didn’t blink.

1pgykp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pgykp7/aitah_for_being_frustrated_with_my_so_for_leaving/,AITAH for being frustrated with my s/o for leaving a huge fucking mess around the apartment that I had to clean up after a long all day shift?,"She has a habit of leaving trash wherever she snacked, may that be skin of some fruit on the couch, the corner of the wrapping paper, half eaten plates of food, add to that the last sip of every single drink compulsively left unconsumed, so imagine 2-3 cups of unfinished coffee and tea + filters randomly laying around. It is a frequent subject of disagreement, because I was raised in a family where there is really low tolerance for mess. I am sort of traumatized by a military dad and a healthcare mom, so basically my entire life I was told I am not good enough to meet the cleanliness and order expectations set by them, so you can imagine the frustration where another person gets to get away with acting like this when my parents would have scolded even 7-8 year old me for not cleaning up after myself. Most days when I am away for work, and she's home, she cleans up, sometimes even going the extra mile and cleans the apartment, partially or otherwise.

However, to get to the point: For fairness sake she did say that she felt like she was dying at around 9PM, listing very peculiar symptoms that got her worrying. I left home at c. 1:30 PM, at that point she only had a headache. I didn't have much time to clean up everything in the kitchen, some small stuff left out, my mug on the table etc. as I was in a hurry. She only texted me hours later that she felt like her body's giving up on her and was worrying that she's going blind for some reason that she still haven't explained fully. On the way home from work, at around midnight, I called her to ask how she feels. She said that things are okay, she will explain later and that she already went to sleep, as she has classes tomorrow.

When I got home after a long, shitty, soul crushing day, the entire apartment was a mess, trash, bowls, the linear combination of the previous two: trash in milky cereal bowls, clothes, coat hangers, mugs etc. As a response I wrote a message on a sticky note that said: 

*""Honey... Next time please clean up after yourself? There was trash & dirty dishes, glasses, mugs everywhere. It was a really unpleasant surprise arriving home after a shitty day. I wasn't raised in a family where this is normal. Please act like an adult and place dishes into the sink/dishwasher & the trash into the trash can as soon as you're done! Don't take this to heart...""*

She woke up and came out of the bedroom however, we met and she saw I was frustrated. I told her that it might be best to talk about it later tomorrow, she wanted to get it out right away, because of not wanting to go back to sleep with the anxiety of not knowing. So I told her and showed her the note. She said that it's mostly because of how awful she started feeling physically and blamed it all on that.

She went back to the bedroom, then after 3 minutes opened the door only to say that ""You know what? I think you're an asshole...""

Now dear Reddit... Am I the asshole?

**TL;DR:** My gf thinks I'm an asshole for assertively asking her to clean up after herself despite feeling ill",1,1765154527.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Just recently, she got news that she will be leaving in a little under 2 weeks now for several months (over 5). The next time I see her in person, there will not be much time at all until she leaves. The last time I saw her (today), there was not a great opportunity to ask her before we went out own ways. 

In general I like to do these kinds of things in person. Would it be a terrible thing to send her a text? Also, would it be good to get coffee with her now, or too little time?

I started my shift just like any other, with a cup of coffee.
Ten years on the job, caffeine’s basically part of the uniform.

Get to work.
Throw on my uniform.
Grab the keys to my sector car.
Get the coffee flowing through my veins as fast as possible.

My routine rarely strays. I stop at the same coffee shop five minutes from the precinct. They know my name. They know my order. I could walk in half asleep and still leave with exactly what I need.

While I waited at the counter, my eyes drifted over to the cork board near the door. The one layered with half torn flyers and yellowed business cards.

Landscapers looking for work.

A babysitter trying to pick up extra hours.

A dog walker for people too lazy or too busy to do it themselves.

Just as my name was called, something new caught my eye.

A missing poster.

I don’t remember ever seeing one there before. Maybe I never paid attention.

I grabbed my coffee and stepped toward the board. I took a closer look, tugging the paper free from the thumbtack.

The photo stopped me cold.

It wasn’t a blurry security image or a kid who looked kind of familiar.

It was my niece.

Her school photo.

The same one my sister keeps on the fridge. The same one I carry in my wallet.

Above the picture, bold black letters.

Missing 

Last seen: 

The date written there was the same day I was standing in that coffee shop, holding it.

I didn’t have time to be confused.
My hands were already patting my pockets, searching for my phone.
When I realized it was still in the car, I ran shoulder checking the door on my way out, nearly spilling someone’s latte as I pushed past.

No missed calls. No voicemails. No texts.
I hit my sister’s number.

No answer.
Tried again.
Nothing.

I kept calling the whole drive over. Each ring felt longer than the last.

I pulled up hard in front of her house, tires scraping against the curb.
My niece’s scooter was still on the porch from the night before, lying on its side.

I rang the bell, then knocked, then called her name.

The door flew open.
My sister stood there, hair wet, bathrobe disheveled, eyes wide like she’d just run from the shower.

For a second she just stared at me, confused, trying to place why I was there.
Then she saw the crumpled flyer in my hand.

The color drained from her face.

“What happened?” she whispered.


I stepped inside. She knew something was wrong before I said a word.

I held out the paper. “Look at this.”

Her eyes went wide. For a second she didn’t breathe.
“What the hell is this? She’s fine, she’s at school!”

“Are you sure?”

“Yes! I saw her get on the bus just like every morning.”

“Call the school..” I said. “Now.”

“You’re scaring me. Why wouldn’t she be there?”

“Just call.”

She grabbed her phone with shaking hands. I turned away, trying to keep my head clear.
I needed to radio this in, tell a supervisor, something.

There was no chance in hell I could finish my shift without knowing she was safe.

I walked into the kitchen, trying to gather my thoughts.
Mind racing.

The fridge caught my eye.
The picture, her school photo, the one that I had grown accustom to seeing was gone.

I went back to the living room. My sister was standing still, phone slipping from her hand.
It hit the floor and bounced once against her bare foot.

Tears filled her eyes.
“She never made it.” She whispered.

I called my supervisor and explained the situation.
Told him we had a missing juvenile.
Told him about the missing poster I found.

He assured me that all hands would be on deck and told me to wait there so my sister and I could give statements when the other officers and detectives arrived.

Even though my sister was distraught, we still needed answers.
I asked her about the missing photo from the fridge.

She looked confused.
“I never took that photo down. Why would I?”

The pit that had already settled in my stomach felt like it was spreading through the rest of my body.

I told my sister not to move and stood up slowly.
I took the gun from my holster and began to clear the house.

Something hung over the place.
I can’t put words to it, but it didn’t feel right.

The last room left to check was my niece’s.
I opened the door and stepped inside, ready to confront anyone, or anything I saw.

Her room was always a disaster.
Clothes on the floor, toys everywhere, half finished drawings on the desk.

Now it was spotless.
Bed made with perfect corners.
Toys put away in every bin they belonged in.
No clothes on the floor.
Not even dust on the dresser.

I called for my sister.
She came to the doorway and froze.

“Did you clean this? Did she clean this?” I asked.

“No.” Her voice was flat, empty. Then she broke down crying.

The first unit showed up less than ten minutes after I called it in.
Blue lights rolled across the front of the house, painting the walls.
Two uniforms came through the door, calm but moving fast. One of them knew me; he didn’t say anything, just gave a small nod that seemed to say “We got it from here.”

I holstered my weapon and stepped back toward the kitchen. The energy drained out of me all at once. I could feel the weight of the gun pulling at my belt, the sweat drying cold under my vest.

A detective arrived next, followed by crime scene techs. They moved quietly, professional. My sister sat at the table with a blanket over her shoulders, answering the same questions again and again. I tried to focus on the facts for my statement. Time, location, who found what, but my mind kept jumping back to that room.

A tech brushed powder over the doorframe, then over the dresser. Nothing but smudges. He went to the window next. After a minute he called the detective over.

They had found prints on the inside glass. Small ones. Too small to be mine, too defined to be old.

Outside, the radios crackled with chatter. More units canvassing the neighborhood, checking the bus stops, talking to anyone awake.

I stood by the front window watching the reflection of red and blue pulse across the street. Then a voice came over the radio.

“Dispatch, we’ve got something at the bus stop. Another poster. Different photo, same handwriting.”

Everyone in the room went still.

The detective looked at me.
“Stay here.” he said quietly, and headed for the door.

I watched him leave, lights spilling after him into the dark.

I wasn’t about to just stand there so I followed.

The photo seemed to be taken that morning.
My niece standing at the bus stop, backpack on, head turned toward the street.

The detective asked, “You take this?”

I didn’t answer.

Because we both knew I hadn’t.

The detective kept the photo sealed in an evidence sleeve. He told me to go home, get some rest, let them handle the canvass.
I nodded, but we both knew I wasn’t going to sleep.

My sister needed me. My niece needed me.
I walked back to the house to tell my sister what we’d seen. Her world was crashing down around her. She shouldn’t be alone.

I convinced her to grab a few things and come stay with me until we figured this out. With no other choice, she agreed.

We stopped by the precinct to pick up my personal car.
Not many words between us.

I looked over at her.
“We’re going to find her,” I said. “I’m going to find her.”

No response. She just stared out the window.

When we pulled into my driveway, I got out first and grabbed her bag from the back seat.
The porch light flickered once as we walked up.

Something was stuck to the front door.

Even before I read it, I knew what it was.

Another missing poster.

Another different photo.

It was from my birthday.
My niece hugging me, both of us smiling at the camera.

A picture that only I had.

A picture that was in my living room.

The detectives came to sweep MY house now. 

The doorframe shows no forced entry, no prints. The birthday photo is gone.

That night, sleep never came.
My sister was on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, the TV still playing from where we’d left it. The volume was low, a soft hum under the silence.

I checked the doors twice. Then a third time. Every lock, every window.

When I walked back into the living room, my sister had finally drifted off. Exhaustion winning over panic. I went to grab another blanket for her.

That’s when I noticed the empty space on the wall. 

I could not believe someone had been in my house. I could not believe ANY of this was happening.

Then I heard it.

A faint whirring sound from down the hall.

I followed it toward my office. The sound grew louder, steady.

When I opened the door, the printer on my desk was running.
Pages spilling onto the floor.

I stepped closer and picked one up.

A missing poster.

Same format. Same bold letters.

Each one a different photo of my niece.",1,1765154385.0,TheMidnightArchives,0,1.0,False

Some examples: • He teases me a LOT, way more than other coworkers. • He defends me when someone talks badly about me. • He once drove me home when I had no car. • He brought his expensive perfume to work because I told him to (as a joke). • He joked that if he guessed my perfume, I’d have to stop talking (he doesn’t make jokes like that with others). • A coworker texted him asking if there’s a girl he likes, and he said “I already know who,” but he never says anything else. • He also teases me with another coworker (saying that guy thinks I’m cute), but I don’t know if he’s joking to hide his own feelings. • When he came back from a football trip to Milan, I joked “without me?” and he told me I should buy a plane ticket next time if I want to come. • He sometimes acts more friendly/chill with me when fewer coworkers are around. BUT he also said once that he doesn’t want a relationship anymore because of a bad breakup. So I’m confused. Sometimes he acts like he likes me, sometimes not. Sometimes he does the same jokes with guys, so I don’t know if it means anything or if it’s just his personality. I’m going to Milan soon, and I’m thinking of asking him something casual like: “What do you think about hanging out before I leave? Just something chill like coffee.” But I don’t want things to be awkward at work if he doesn’t feel the same. I usually get nervous and forget everything when I’m around him.

Perhaps I should tell him a little about myself in the initial message or just leave him alone and see if we match on a dating app? ",2,1765154170.0,OnlineDating,3,1.0,False
1pgyfza,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReloadedSteam/comments/1pgyfza/seeking_aim_of_human_civilization/,seeking aim of human civilization,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

4 dashes Aromatic bitters (The Bitter Truth)

I wasn’t in the mood for coffee liqueur and I had some of the other ingredients (minus Campari) out and ready to go. Hence the Crimson King reference. 

Not a huge fan of Benedictine, so I thought I’d sub the Cherry Heering in with essentially the same ingredients as a Monte Carlo (minus the amaro). The Montenegro and Cherry Heering are both great partners to a good rye whiskey and this cocktail is no exception.

1pgyev1,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1pgyev1/coworker_threatened_to_call_ice_on_me/,Coworker threatened to call ICE on me,"This happened last Sunday and I was off on Monday and Tuesday.

It was at 2:06PM and I was preparing to clean my coffee bar and count my till. We were talking while getting ready to go. My coworker K said the security guard’s bald head was funny, so I said I was going to poke it. I did it and we all started laughing, even the security guard. Then this crackhead lady who works in the meat department appeared out of nowhere and yelled “I’m going to call ice on you and ship you back to your country. I’m going to get you deported.” Everyone was like wtf?! She kept doubling down. So I sent an Email to HR. Someone told her I had emailed HR, so she ran to the manager’s office to report me for reporting her…? I then recorded the whole thing. She lied that I was sexually harassing the security guard (By poking his head?) and that was the reason why she did that! Then she saw that I was recording and said she would sue me for violating her HIPAA. What the actual fuck is this bitch on?! 
So when I came back on Wednesday, one of my managers told me they would probably fire and the crackhead. 

It has been exactly a week since that happened. No one had seen her since the incident, so I figured she quit, but NOPE! She strolled right in with a smile on her face yesterday(Saturday). She also came in today(Sunday) and she kept coming to the front to look at me. I am really upset and uncomfortable and I think I will have to quit. I have anxiety and depression and this is really making me want to relapse and self-harm. I asked my manager what the update with HR is and she said they said they didn’t get any emails and they don’t really care and that she should just fire us. She said since they don’t care, she’ll just move on. But I can’t move on! I feel targeted! 

Ps: I live in New Orleans and ICE have been just sent here. Even though I am a permanent resident and I am legal, this is still scary for me because ICE doesn’t care.",10,1765154063.0,retailhell,0,1.0,False

1pgycfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1pgycfy/anyone_have_the_link_andor_title_for_this_story/,Anyone have the link and/or title for this story?,"My father died in the same bed as my childhood friend's mother. When they were found, their lower bodies were still locked together.
From that moment on, Mitchell and I became mortal enemies.
He drove a car straight into my father’s funeral.
I smashed his mother’s urn on the dock and scattered her ashes into the sea.
Our hatred consumed us, sharp and venomous. We spent ten years wounding each other until we finally wore ourselves out.
He took his crew and left for Mexico.
I stayed in New York and became the city's most sought-after bounty hunter.
But when we met again years later, he was neither my enemy nor the boy I once knew.
He walked into the morgue—into the room where I was lying.
Years later, we finally got the chance to faced each other in silence.

After finishing my job, I hurried back to the small bakery I used as a front to tend to my injuries.
The wall-mounted TV showed Mitchell Harvey's return.
The former golden boy of New York's elite circles, now Mexico's top arms dealer, was back in town. Of course, it was headline news.
I roughly bandaged my wound and moved toward the small memorial corner I kept for my father.
Suddenly, a girl with chin-length hair burst into the shop.
She looked serious but spoke loudly. Clutching red roses, she pointed at the display case. ""I'll take everything here!""
Close behind was Roderick Dunlap, Mitchell's best friend and right-hand man.
When he saw me, he froze, his expression tightening. ""Yas, maybe we should go somewhere else?""
The girl refused immediately. ""No way!
""I brought Mitch desserts from here before. He said they were amazing. It's his birthday today. I need to get more.""
She gave me a pleading look. ""Ma'am, my fiancé's returning today. He loves your pastries. Could I use your space for a birthday surprise?""
I couldn't refuse, so I nodded.
""Could we get some extra desserts?"" she asked.
I agreed, noticing my fresh bandage was already bleeding through.
I hid my hand under my apron and walked unsteadily toward the kitchen.
It wasn't fear or nostalgia.
My illness was flaring up again.
It was incurable.
""Roderick, we're running out of time! Help me set up! Mitch's gonna be here any minute, and I want everything perfect.""
Roderick didn't move.
He knew Mitchell was never happy to see me.
On the news broadcast, Mitchell smiled for the cameras, yet his eyes remained cold.
""I'm sure she's watching too. I'm looking forward to... seeing her again.""
 
###Chapter 2
The camera zoomed in, highlighting the scar bisecting his eyebrow.
It was my doing, with a knife.
I was having a bad day, and he was there. So, I attacked him.
The ugly scar on my neck was his doing. He crushed a glass and used a shard to attack me.
Again, there was no deep motive.
We had a simple understanding: hurt the other, get hurt in return. We liked seeing each other in pain.
The news anchor smiled suggestively. ""Planning a long stay, Mr. Harvey? Those roses... Are you meeting someone special?""
He paused, his voice low. ""My fiancée.""
In the shop, the girl was adjusting roses in a candelabra. She glanced up at the TV.
""Roderick,"" she said, ""I heard Mitch had some messy history with a girl here for ten years. You know anything about that?""
I kept my head down, polishing a knife, but felt Roderick's gaze flicker toward me.
""Mitch!"" Her shout cut through the tension.
She forgot her umbrella and dashed outside.
""Yas.""
Mitchell caught her in a one-armed hug, his umbrella shielding her from the rain.
She rose on her toes and pressed a quick, rain-damp kiss to his lips.
I thought I saw him lean back, just slightly.
Then his eyes found mine through the wet glass.
The girl tried to turn, but he cupped her chin and kissed her again, deeper this time.
I looked away and snipped the ribbon I was holding.
Roderick approached.
""Paulette,"" he said, voice low. ""It's his birthday. For one night, could you just not anger him?""
He hesitated, seeming to think of something. ""She's nineteen. Clean slate. Reminds him of you before.""
I nodded, my fingers feeling numb.
""She's pretty. Prettier than I was.""
The door opened. Mitchell stood there, folding his black umbrella.
""Discussing my fiancée?""
His tone was light, but his stare was cold as it rested on me.
 
###Chapter 3
Roderick watched me, holding his breath.
He was waiting for one of my classic outbursts.
Instead, I simply pushed the boxed cake toward them. ""Your dark chocolate cheesecake.""
Yasmine Murphy gazed at Mitchell with adoration. ""Try it, Mitch. Is this your favorite?""
He took a sip of coffee, rubbing the edge of the cup, before cutting a small piece with the silver dessert fork.
""Bitter. Unpleasantly so. Not for me.""
His tone was light, his eyes smiling as he teased Yasmine.
She looked confused and took a bite herself. ""It's delicious! You're lying to me again!""
She didn't see that his gaze remained fixed on me over her head.
Suddenly, the door chime jangled loudly.
""Hey, Mitch! Welcome back!""
A few men crowded in, their laughter cutting off abruptly when they saw me.
Their eyes followed me, wary and questioning, before turning to Roderick.
I carried over the pot of lemonade. The men flinched in unison, raising their hands defensively, as if I were holding acid.
Back when Mitchell and I were at each other's throats, his crew got caught in the crossfire a few times.
It was never anything serious, just minor incidents. I was surprised they still reacted this way.
Someone nudged Roderick. ""Roddy, what's she doing here?""
Roderick just shrugged, not explaining.
""Enjoy your lemonade,"" I said, turning to leave.
Yasmine caught my wrist. ""Wait! Could you take a picture for us?""
""No,"" I said, calmly removing her hand.
I'd only taken a few steps when a figure moved to block my path.
I looked up to see Mitchell's gloomy face. ""I know how this works,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Everything has a price. So name it. How much to get you to...""
He paused deliberately, waiting for me to react. When I didn't, he finished coldly. ""Take a picture for us.""
I looked him over and tried to step around him.
A sharp pressure on a nerve in my arm sent a jolt of pain through me, and my legs gave way. I fell to my knees. A black card was flung down, its edge catching my cheek and drawing a thin line of blood.
""That's more than enough to make you disappear.""
I pushed myself back to my feet, my fingers gingerly touching the cut, my eyes fixed on Mitchell.
Yasmine quickly stepped between us, her smile strained. ""Mitch, stop it, okay?
""Sorry, miss. He must have had too much to drink.""
But he didn't smell of alcohol. He was simply picking a fight, same as always.
It convinced me he'd been having such a good time abroad that he'd forgotten who he was dealing with.
I bent down, picked up the black card, and stood facing him again.
His friends let out a low laugh.
""Some things never change. She still jumps for money.""
He held out his phone with a confident smirk, pleased by my apparent cooperation.
I moved fast. I grabbed his jaw, scraped the edge of the card through a thick glob of chocolate frosting, and shoved it into his mouth.
I didn't stop until I smelled blood. Then I grabbed two glasses from the table and poured the liquor down his throat.
""Consider your mouth cleaned,"" I said.
I turned and slapped the man who had spoken. ""Learn when to keep quiet.""
The whole thing was over in seconds. No one else moved. The only sound was the rain hitting the windows.
Roderick, leaning against the far wall, drained his glass and sighed heavily. ""I told you not to provoke her.""
Yasmine finally snapped out of her shock, her posture defensive as she confronted me. ""We were out of line first. I get it. But this is just insane!""
She raised her hand to strike me.
""Ah!"" I caught her wrist mid-swing and slapped her, hard, across the face.
The sound was sharp in the quiet room.
Mitchell spat out a mix of blood and frosting, a cold smile on his lips. ""You want a fight with me? Fine. But you can't touch her.""
He pulled the sobbing Yasmine close, her cheek still swollen from the slap. ""How about I trash this place for you? Will that make you feel better?""
She nodded and covered her cheek, tears in her eyes.
His bodyguards in black swarmed in. Clubs swung down, shattering glass and smashing the overhead light.
Cold wind and rain blew through the broken windows, soaking my face.
Mitchell gripped my chin, forcing my head up.
""You didn't start this. But she needs to see it end. Send me the bill for the damages. All of it.""
His eyes scanned me like I was a piece of discarded furniture.
I shoved his hand away, a sudden coughing fit seizing me. I frantically searched through the wreckage.
A small white prescription bottle rolled into view. My eyes locked onto it.
He was faster. He bent down and plucked it, reading the label.
""Six of these at once? Are you trying to kill yourself?""
He tossed the bottle into a rainwater puddle, put his arm around Yasmine, and walked away.
I knelt by the puddle, retrieved the bottle, and swallowed two more pills.
This medication was for anxiety and pain.
I started with half a pill. Now, eight couldn't stop my pain.
The pills were nearly gone. And so was I.
 
###Chapter 4
Three years passed, and my mother died too.
My work was unstable. I'd taken many lives and become a target myself.
I'd spent all my savings on that bakery. Now, with it destroyed, I had nowhere left to go.
Maybe it was the pain seizing my limbs again, but I lacked the strength to move. I simply sat amidst the wreckage, letting the rain soak me.
Overnight, every major tabloid in New York led with ""Mitchell Harvey Returns to Wreak Havoc on His Ex.""
By sunrise, I was ready to leave.
Before going, I faced the shattered ruins and slowly bowed.
Mitchell appeared out of nowhere. He hauled me to my feet with one hand.
""It's just a bakery. Is it worth this?""
I slapped his hand away, steadied myself, and then struck him three sharp slaps across the face.
""My parents' memorial plaques were inside. They're gone now,"" I said, my voice flat. ""The bow was necessary.""
He worked his jaw, then smirked. ""Three slaps for your mother's memorial? Sounds like I got the better deal.""
I ignored him, staring at the devastation.
He stood behind me, deliberately twisting the knife.
""Paulette Sherman. I'm talking to you.""
I acted as if I hadn't heard and walked away.
He caught up in a few strides, blocking my path.
""Stop pretending you're fine! Look at yourself. You're ghostly pale. What are you trying to prove?""
""My old condition flared up. A little tired, that's all."" I looked up, offering a cold smile. ""Mitchell, did you really think you were important enough to affect me?""
But I knew the truth.
He'd come back specifically to make my life hell.
If I were still in good health, I wouldn't mind another round, maybe breaking a few of his bones in the process.
But now, just standing upright consumed all my energy.
In the hospital, the smell of disinfectant was nauseating.
Several doctors studied my scans, their expressions grim.
""How much of your last prescription is left?""
""It's gone.""
""Gone?!"" Steven Harriman's voice rose sharply. ""That was a three-month supply! It's only been a week!""
Steven had handled my case for years. His hesitation told me everything—my time was running out.
""Is... there anyone else in your family?"" he asked carefully.
""Have you forgotten?"" My tone was flat. ""My father's dead. My mother's gone. It's just me.""
He removed his glasses, rubbing the bridge of his nose. ""You were managing well for three years. What happened this past week...""
My phone screen lit up with a news alert—a prominent photo of Mitchell with Yasmine on his arm at some gala.
The person I thought I was over still hurt me the most.
Mitchell was the source of my deepest wounds, the one who knew how to hurt me most without leaving a mark.
""Your condition is extremely unstable. After stopping the medication, the first week, the first month, and the third month are all critical periods.
""Take this,"" he said, handing me a small bottle. His voice was heavy. ""Three pills when the pain is severe. No more than three.""
Before he finished, I'd twisted the cap off, shaken a handful into my palm, and dry-swallowed them.
The number didn't matter, as long as it dulled the bone-deep agony.
A week or three months made no difference to me.
After taking the pills, I crouched in the most inconspicuous corner of the hospital corridor, my back pressed against the cold wall.
I'd figured out that lowering my body temperature could ease the pain.
Cold sweat soaked through my thin clothes.
For ten minutes, I listened to the desperate prayers and weeping outside the operating room, where all hope hung on a single, fragile thread.
""Mommy, isn't that the lady who was in the bed next to us? Should we say goodbye?""
""Her illness... There's no cure. Let's not bother her. Such a tragic case. No family left, and such a severe sickness. She probably won't even have anyone to hold a funeral for her.""
The little girl looked up, confused. ""But surely someone in the world cares about her, right?""
I blinked hard, clearing my blurred vision, and focused on my phone screen.
A text came from Mitchell.
He'd been messaging since last night, persistently asking what compensation I wanted.
I thought about it. Maybe no one cared, but there was one person who could handle the funeral arrangements.
I dialed the number I knew by heart.
He answered instantly.
""Made up your mind?""
I took a sharp breath, swallowing the metallic taste in my mouth. ""If you insist on paying me back, Mitchell, you can be the one to bury me.""
 
###Chapter 5
Silence stretched for seconds on the other end, followed by Mitchell's mocking laugh.
""Paulette, someone as vicious and stubborn as you usually lives forever. But if you do somehow die before me, rest assured, I'll give you the most lavish funeral New York has ever seen. I'll have the whole city light memorial candles for you!""
Satisfied with his promise, I hung up.
Outside the hospital, I saw the mother and daughter again.
The little girl was pounding her chest, her voice full of childish conviction. ""Who says nobody cares about her just because she has no family? Well, I do!""
""Enough, let's go. The bus is. Oh, the bus!"" Her mother pulled her away, rushing for the departing bus.
I walked to the parking garage and got into my black sedan.
Seeing they'd missed the bus, I impulsively rolled down the window. ""Get in. I'll give you a ride.""
I dropped them off downtown. They thanked me profusely and got out.
Just as I was about to pull away, I heard an irritating voice.
""Well, look at that. Paulette did a good deed. I suppose even you need to score some points.""
Mitchell's usual crowd was exiting a nearby club. Yasmine clung to his arm, her gaze sharp and venomous.
I didn't want a scene. I started raising the window to leave.
But Yasmine hurried over and pressed her hand against the glass.
A fake smile played on her lips, but her eyes were cold. ""I just found out about your history with Mitch. I hope we didn't... upset you yesterday?""
I had no patience for her act and tried to close the window again.
She gripped the window frame tightly. ""I have something for you. I really mean no harm.""
""I'm not interested. Get lost."" My patience was gone.
Yasmine suddenly let go. As I started the car, she pulled a small urn from her bag.
""I heard your mother's memorial plaque was destroyed in the shop. I gathered some ashes from the ruins this morning so you'd have something to remember her by.""
Her voice was sweet, but her actions were pure malice.
She reached through the window and poured the contents of the urn onto my passenger seat.
""Oh! You... you didn't catch it!"" she cried, stepping back with a perfect mask of innocence and sly satisfaction. ""You're not mad at me, are you?""
I watched her performance, and a sudden anger burned through the sickness inside me.
Good. She asked for this.
The group by the club entrance, clueless, was still praising Yasmine. ""Yas is so thoughtful, talking to that mess and even giving her a gift.""
Yasmine confidently turned and walked towards a shiny new Porsche parked ahead, triumphantly shaking her key fob.
I rolled down my window and called out, ""Yasmine! I have a gift for you, too!""
Yasmine turned, crossing her arms smugly. ""What are you giving me, Paulette?""
I tightened my seatbelt, my eyes locking on her. ""A one-way trip.""
Before the words faded, I slammed the accelerator.
""Bang!""
The front of my car smashed into the Porsche's rear.
Yasmine's car lurched forward uncontrollably.
I reversed, then slammed the gas again, hitting it a second time!
In the rearview mirror, I saw the drunken group jolt into sobriety.
""She's insane! She's actually insane!""
""I told you she was a lunatic! But you had to provoke her!""
""Relax, she won't really do anything. She's just blowing off steam, and then...""
He didn't finish.
True, I was blowing off steam.
But I wasn't done yet.
Yasmine stumbled out of the smoking car, her face pale, already slipping back into her fragile victim role.
""Mitch, wh... what did I do wrong?""
Mitchell had a cut on his forehead from flying glass, bleeding slightly. He moved urgently to shield Yasmine.
He understood my intent in a single glance.
""Paulette! Don't you dare!""
Ridiculous. There was nothing I dared not do.
I kept my eyes on Yasmine, my expression icy, and floored the accelerator.
The engine roared as the car shot straight toward her.
 
###Chapter 6
I unbuckled my seatbelt, got out, and coldly observed Yasmine sprawled on the pavement a few yards away.
Her legs and arms were scraped and bleeding.
""You're lucky I let off the gas. Otherwise, you'd have more than scratches,"" I stated calmly.
She looked up, her eyes filled with naked hatred. ""Mitchell will make you pay for this!""
I picked up my handbag from the passenger seat, now soiled with the ashes, and used its corner to lift her chin. ""There. The real you is much more tolerable.""
I took the bag back, dusting it off with disgust. The group rushed over.
Mitchell hurried to help Yasmine up.
I took out my phone, called an ambulance, then tossed the handbag toward Yasmine.
""This bag's resale value is about 20,000 dollars. More than enough for her medical bills and the car repairs.""
""Paulette!"" Mitchell's voice was thick with suppressed rage.
I ignored him and walked away.
The taste of blood filled my mouth. I pressed my lips together and quickened my pace.
I nearly ran from the scene. Rounding a corner, sure I was out of sight, I braced myself against a wall and coughed, splattering dark blood onto the grimy brick.
A ringing filled my ears, my vision blurring. I forced myself onward, moving on instinct until I reached my temporary apartment.
If my body had held up, I might have turned back to cause Mitchell more trouble. I desperately wanted to see him furious and helpless against me.
I collapsed near the living room coffee table and poured a glass of water.
But after one sip, I coughed it all back up—water and blood.
The half-glass of water instantly turned crimson.
I lay on the floor, gasping for air. It felt like an invisible hand was twisting my insides. The pain was maddening, but I lacked even the strength to clench my teeth.
I had no idea how much time had passed before the buzzing of my phone and violent pounding on my door dragged me back to consciousness.
For a moment, I'd thought I wouldn't make it through the night.
The name flashing on the screen was Mitchell.
""Paulette! Open the door! I know you're in there!""
His voice came through, threatening and absolute, while the door thumped under his force.
""If you don't open it, I'll break it down!""
I knew he meant it. But I would never let him see me like this—broken and dying.
Summoning the last of my strength, I crawled into the bedroom, moved the wardrobe, and squeezed into the narrow hiding space behind it. The sound of the door being forced open echoed from outside, followed by hurried footsteps.
His texts flooded my screen, one after another.
""Hiding? You think that works?""
""Get out of here! We need to talk!""
""If anything happens to Yasmine, I'll make you pay with your life!""
I stared at my phone. A sudden drop of nosebleed hit the screen, forming a dark red stain. My consciousness faded.",1,1765153879.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I’ve been trying to get consistent with excercies, but I always fall off the wagon. I realized I don't care about those health stats or VO2 Max but I wanted to make it more appealing for me and to make it more gamified.

So I spent the last weekend building a weird little web-app called QuestFit.

The concept is simple:

You choose a goal (Muscle, Cardio).

You get an 8-bit class (Knight, Archer, Mage).

Your real-world workouts (via Strava/Apple Health) deal damage to a Raid Boss that the whole community fights together.

I'm currently working on fleshing out the logic itself and creating guided training program with game connectivity of having boss raids.

It’s super MVP right now (built with Cursor & a lot of coffee), but I’d love to know if this concept actually motivates you or if it’s too gimmicky.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

* We vote for the same party our family always voted for.
* We copy clothes, diet, travel places after seeing Instagram reels.

1pgya5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1pgya5g/dream_walker/,Dream walker,"Dream, dreamer, dream for it is but a glimpse beyond mortality.

Ever since I was a kid, I could not recall the dreams that came forth to me whilst in nocturnal's sweet embrace. Later in life, my father would tell me tales of my bouts of night terrors, to which he claimed I would wake up screaming so loudly as to awaken the entire town of Carthridge. I recall the years of sleepless nights he spoke of, when I'd wake up on the brink of midnight in sweats, screaming my voice hoarse. Those nights, when I would remain in bed, afraid to fall asleep. I could not recall my nightmares, but the pit in my stomach taught me to fear sleep.

I recall the worst and final night of my night terrors. I had once more woken up my father to anguished screams. This time, he found me in bed, lying in my own blood. He looked me over and found many deep scratch marks running the length of my back. The wounds required stitches and were ultimately dismissed as self-inflicted due to my nightmares. They didn't come again after that night. Not for many years.

They are back now, and so I find myself waking throughout the night drenched in sweat. I haven't properly slept in many nights and find myself wearing down. I called my father, who recommended to me the sleep therapist who'd treated me as a kid after my incident.

I walked up the narrow staircase to her office. I knocked on the door, and it thumped as it was pushed against its frame before being pulled open. An older woman with messy, wild, white hair stood there, in a neat, pressed beige suit jacket and dress.

“Hi, I'm Dr.Zakrowsky. It's nice to meet you. Sorry about the door, I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.”

 She led me into the room, making her way around a large desk. It was a neat room with the exception of a black and silver robe that was splayed across a plain white couch. Despite the neat appearance of the room and her clothes. The dirt under her fingernails and messy appearance were all too distracting.  

“So how can I help you today?” She asked as I sat in a chair before her desk.

“Same thing we spoke on the phone about. My night terrors are back.”

“Ah, yes, and when's the last time you had these night terrors?”

“When I last came to see you, when I was ten. Don't you have my file?”

“We lost some files while digitalizing everything. I'd like to try a new solution I've been hearing about. It'll seem a little fringe, but I've heard nothing but great things. I'd like to take a herbalist approach to this solution. You see, some cultures believe that some herbs can ease the consumer into sleep, allowing them to have a more relaxed sleep, reducing the chances of night terrors, and that's what I was hoping we could try today.” 

When she finished speaking, she opened the top drawer of her desk and pulled out a small pouch of herbs.

“You can make it into a tea and drink it before going to bed. Anywho, that'll be it for today. I'll be in contact with you in a couple of days to see how everything's coming along.”I thanked her as she hurried me out the door.

When dusk came, light retreated, and night's darkness fell upon the town. I made the sweet-smelling tincture, which smelled of roses and rosemary. As it came to my tongue, I was met with a sweet, silky smooth taste that slid its way down my gullet, warming me from the inside. The effects were immediate, and I flopped loosely onto my bed, as though I had been drugged. I looked out my window and saw the snow gently falling. I sank into my bed like quicksand, slowly sinking deeper and deeper, until all light was cut off. In the void, I saw a ray of light, growing closer and closer. The ground spat me out, and I found myself lying on a soft, cold bed of snow in Carthridge's town square. The night sky was a black ever ever-expanding void, empty of any light. The only light around me came from the street lights. The town was still and silent, the only sound was the whistling wind rushing through the empty streets. I looked around for any sign of life, but found none.

Months have passed, and the snow has gone.  I've walked the streets, searched homes, only to find them empty. Entire homes and apartment complexes were hollowed out like husks as though they served as nothing more than set dressing. My apartment complex was the only building that was normal. My room was the same as it had always been. Although I could open none of the other doors in the building, no matter how hard I bashed into them, the cheap doors would not budge. One day, out of desperation, I walked along the highway out of Carthridge. I walk for hours only to end up walking straight back towards town as though the road had looped around. I've tried so many times, but I just end up walking right back into town.

Still, I remain, and I am alone for this place is devoid of all life. I feel as though I am the first star in the night sky, stuck in an empty void, isolated and so far removed from all existence. This oblivion I find myself trapped in is stuck in perpetual darkness. I often find myself reminiscing on the sun's light, missing its warmth upon my skin. I've given up all hope. I have tried so hard to escape, but there is no way out. I'm tired, so very tired, and I see no other way. I look at the interior of the decrepit shack I found myself in after my last escape attempt. I kick the chair out from underneath me and feel the rope constrict around my neck like a boa. It digs into my skin harshly as I thrash, gasping for air to no avail. I feel the veins in my eyes pop as an intense pressure grows in my head. My head is hot as though it is on fire, as all the blood pools in my face. I flail for hours until I am weak and all energy has been sapped from my body. Death does not come for me, and a single tear rolls down my cheek as the wind gently rocks my body back and forth. 

I believe many more months have passed since. Months in complete isolated silence, staring at the door that stands right before me. Time feels as though it has stood still, if not for the snow that has come once more, blanketing the outside in a powdery, glistening white. The harsh cold has penetrated me down to the bone. It wasn't long before the cold turned into a burning heat, and my body felt as though it had been enveloped in flames. I had long since given up when the crunching sound of footsteps in the snow. A man walked in, his skin was smooth and unblemished, his eyes were brilliant marvels of starlight. Our eyes met, and I was at once filled with the hope of freedom, but the hope was soon crushed when he turned and walked out the door, leaving me to hang. The crushing feeling had been worse than any before to be so close to freedom, to have it dangle before me, only to be torn away. Left to my own fate. Tears froze on my cheeks as they came. 

The wind picked up, and the cabin groaned loudly. Within the hour, a blizzard had set upon me, moving the shack with every gust. It proved to be too much for the tired, old roof, the weight of the snow and my own caused it to collapse, releasing me but trapping me under rubble. Air rushed into my gasping lungs, filling them with the burning, bitter cold air they'd gone so long without. I cried, tears running coolly down my cheeks as I moaned painfully, my voice frail and raspy. I was shocked at the sound of my own voice. A million pins and needles spread through my body like wildfire, filling me with excruciating pain as blood circulated once more. The rubble insulated me from the frigid cold, and my body began to thaw.

Days passed before I had thawed enough to move. I brought my hands slowly up to my face and strangely found no trace of frostbite. I inched forward ever so slightly. Day by day, my unused muscles were weak and nearly useless. The cold had relented, and so after many days, I stood like a newborn standing on his own two feet for the first time. I was freed, and I wobbled my way out on unsteady legs that shook like jello. The pain was blinding, but I pushed forth until I reached my apartment and made it to my room, where I wrapped myself in blankets and felt a comforting warmth for the first time in many, many months. I stayed in my apartment recovering patiently.

When I felt well enough to leave again, another month had passed. As I left my building, I was made aware of many tracks in the deep snow that went to my window before stopping. Many were hardly visible and had been there a while. One set was deeper. They went to my window like the rest, then in the direction of the woods. Desperate to find anyone who may know a way out, I followed them deep into the looming forest. It led all the way to a strange clearing. There was a tall, smooth stone in the middle. I lost all train of thought, my attention was drawn to it, and I walked over. I put my hand on its smooth surface, and it was warm and humming beneath its surface. The incessant wind stood still. For the first time since I arrived here, I looked up and saw a mass of writhing constellations, clusters of bright, beautiful colors dancing inside the mass as it opened its many nebulous eyes and looked down upon me. I heard the crashing of trees and, like thunder before lightning, the deafening roar of hundreds of thousands of voices screaming all at once.

A writhing mass of flesh, limbs, cloths, silks, and leathers. The inorganic matter melding with the organic. It came crashing forth from the tree line. Hundreds and thousands of people all melted into one. A hundred thousand heads, their eyes glowing with the incandescence of the stars. Their voices screaming, groaning and moaning all at once in perfect unison. It was making its way over to me fast. It slammed into trees, sending them careening every which way. I ran, but the snow was so deep my legs moved through it like tar. It was reaching me, and no matter how much I tried, I could hardly run fast enough to get away. I could hear it reaching me, it was not but twenty feet away when I tripped. Closer and closer. It set upon me now inches away as I screamed.

“MICKEY, MICKEY”

My father was standing over me, shaking me. 

“Jesus Christ, kid, you scared the fuck out of me.” He looked completely out of breath, fear-laden in his pale face.

“What's going on?” I asked in a daze

“No one's seen you in two days, Mickey. Your work called me asking if I'd seen you. You're not answering your phone, so I came here, and I find you screaming like a fucking banshee in your sleep. You scared the shit out of me, kiddo.” His body seemed to be at ease when he saw I was alright. 

“Probably just another nightmare. Can I go back to bed?” I replied dismissively 

“Yeah, sure, kiddo. I'll be downstairs when you wake back up.”

Although I don't know why, I have the deepest sense of dread, like I shouldn't, but I think I will just go back to sleep.",1,1765153707.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1pgya0o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgya0o,So i dont want my house to burn down,"So basically a couple of days ago my neighbours across from me got their house all up in flames. Really tragic actually, the whole upstairs is burnt and the downstairs is flooded because of the firefighters but the whole thing is unliveable so they had to move. I can even see the sooted out window from my room

However thats not the important part, the important part is that as far as why the fire started ive heard it was a remote charging or a controller charging and they left it there in the box/bedroom thing, then the thing got so hot it lit up the mattress it was on and so caught on fire.

The reason i mention this is that for months now whenever i plus in an electrical socket with the switch turned on it gives a small flash of white light. It doesnt do that often but sometimes, it also does this with the extension chords.
And also with the photos above heres my charger which has only seen the inside of the power sockets either from the extension chord or straight from the wall. Id like to say im not a messy fella so im going to believe that the dirt that i can't scratch off are burn marks from the sockets

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

I hadn’t ever really done creative writing before (I’m in high school) and I tried posting it a couple places to get feedback and it got removed every time. Would love some thoughts on the style!

  
Have you ever wondered what it’s like to be drowning?

If your answer is no, then don’t worry. You’re normal, like most other people on the planet; like me, until about a week ago. If your answer is yes, then you need to move as far from the sea as you possibly can.

About three months ago, I was the happiest I’d ever been. My wife Katie and I had just been married at a beautiful outdoor wedding in northern Minnesota. It gets a bad rep for being so snowy most of the time, but in the summer, it’s surprisingly pleasant. The day of the wedding was perfect– seventy three degrees without a cloud in the sky. It was one of those days where it seems like there could be nothing better to do than sit under a tree in the sun-dappled shade and allow the crisp, gentle breeze to caress you to sleep. The ceremony went down without a hitch, except for the ringbearer, who, being three, nodded off in the middle and had to be carried to the altar by the seat of his pants. Katie got a kick out of that. 

Then, about a month ago, Katie and I found ourselves an insane deal on a beachfront condo in San Diego, where we could live until I finished medical school at UCSD. 

Working eighty hours a week and cramming for exams in the rest of my time meant Katie I and didn’t get much time together. She got a good paying job as an employee communications specialist with some company called Qualcomm, which kept us fed and me in medical school. 

We made the most of what little time we had. Our beachfront condo meant that we could walk out and watch the sunset together. Our favorite spot was a small bench about a five minute walk from our house. It was one of those plastic ones, the ones that say “made one hundred percent from recycled material.” I always doubted what that bench said. It felt like it was trying a too hard to be something it wasn’t. 

Regardless, I had a certain affection for it, grown out of the experiences, the laughs, and the late night talks it used to share with me and Katie.

Katie was never one for imagination. She and I had met through a friend while I was doing pre-med at Bethel University in Minnesota. Right away, she struck me as a realistic, down-to-earth sort of person, very rarely flaky or imaginative. She wasn’t exactly talkative, but she was affectionate, in a quiet sort of way– I remember one night in my junior year of college when I was studying for finals, she let herself into my room and brought me a couple of beers. She had always hated beer, but she wanted to have one with me, just to try to cheer me up.

That was the moment I decided I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her.

When we first moved into our condo about two weeks ago, I noticed something odd about Katie. When I came home from work, I would find her at our window, looking out at the ocean. When I spoke to her, she would jump slightly, and jerk her head away, as if she had been hypnotized by the grey foam of the wine-dark ocean. When I asked how long she had been standing there, she would just shrug and mumble something, usually along the lines of “just a couple minutes” or sometimes just “I’m not sure.” 

One night, I came home especially late (about 10:30 PM) and found her, still awake, staring into the darkness where the green ocean would have been.

I watched her in silence for a moment. She hadn’t moved when I came in. Her eyes stared out into the darkness, half-glazed with an expression I couldn’t quite fathom. Fear?

Reflection?

Longing?

After a moment, I brought myself to speak.

“Katie?” 

The sound seemed ear-splitting in the quiet, like the sudden crash of a thousand waves against a peaceful shoreline.

 Katie sat silent, her only response the quiet, rhythmic lapping of the wine-dark sea foam that lay beyond the overbearing darkness. I tried again, louder this time.

“Katie! Wake up!”

My wife continued to stare, her eyes glassy, like jade polished by the tossing of the unfathomable green of the sea. Finally she spoke, her voice ragged and watery,

“Do you ever wonder what it’s like to be drowning?”

“I– I don’t know,” I responded shakily. “What’s going on? Katie, what–”

She was standing now, her eyes still on the darkness outside. A glint of something new appeared in them.

“Adam.”

She said my name sternly, like a command.

“Katie, what’s wrong with you? Why—” 

My last question sputtered and died in my throat as she began to walk toward me, her green-glazed, jade-like eyes still resting upon the darkness outside. Her face was pale and livid, tinged green by a light that seemed to come from another place, alien and unfathomable. Her eyes were drowsy and peaceful, the ends of her lips turned up in a quiet smile. Her form was shimmering slightly, like she was being stretched toward the darkness outside. She drew close to me and spoke again.

“I think it feels like going home.”

It was the last thing I would ever hear her say.

I stumbled backward, tripping over my own feet before careening into our wrought-metal coffee table. My head hit the corner of the table with a crack that sent my vision sloshing. The world faded from a swimming green to a sickening, viridescent blue then to black.

I came to about thirty seconds later. Katie was nowhere to be seen. Standing slowly, I barely managed to keep my balance due to what I figured was a moderate concussion. my legs wobbled and almost gave out as I made my way to the door as quickly as I could. I dizzily snatched up the flashlight we kept next there and turned it on. The light momentarily blinded me, nearly causing me to fall again.

“light sensitivity,” I groaned to myself, realizing my head had been hit much harder than I had originally thought.

I stumbled outside, nearly crumpling with every step as I struggled to keep my dizziness under control. A pair of footprints led down the beach, shifting in and out of focus as the flashlight wobbled in my hands. I began to follow before I was overcome with nausea. Slogging through the loose sand of the beach, I fell, vomiting up the protein bars and dried fruit I had snagged from the medical lounge. I pushed myself to a semi-sitting position, my head spinning feverishly.   


I raised the light in my shaky hand to the green-dark sea, the place I saw my wife for the final time.

There she stood, knee deep in the emerald foam. Her arms were open slightly, as if receiving the welcoming embrace of a long-lost loved one. I saw a black shape rise from the deep. I saw her body stretch and fade, replaced by emerald foam as a final wave washed over her. Then the unfathomable green was at peace.

When I woke, I found her wedding ring in the sand beside me. The ring I gave her before the sea took her. I wear it now as I write this, driving as fast as I can, away from the sea and from the woman I loved most in all the world. And as I drive, I start to wonder what how it felt to drown.

Did it really feel like going home?

I don’t attend until the spring so I’ve got time. Then she proceeds to talk about the game driving on the freeway to the college and how I need  both my parents to sit with while I drive and get comfortable but I’ve seen on the freeway various times and I think I can do it myself. And to me it felt more of her saying I basically don’t know how to drive on the freeway. And dad asks like what time does your class start. Pretty much when you step foot into the class and then it turns into an argument. Then she starts going off on me and my dad about many things. She talks about because I told her that’s it was a talk or lecture and she got hurt by that and started crying. Then she goes on to say she’s had to deal with so much when it comes to carrying me and how hard it’s been for her because she’s been laid off for a years and spends time by herself. And when we go somewhere like and outlet and it gets hot in the car we open the windows and then she said it’s too cold or we turn the ac on low it’s also cold. She’s like she doesn’t want to be a burden for us even when we go camping with friends. I’m not gonna deny my dads got issues of his own but my mother fully went after him the most more than me. She’s said she understand what’s her FIL said when she picked up the scraps and married my dad. Shes pretty said she’s regretted marrying my dad and thinks he doesn’t love her anymore. Personally I think he does because doing everything to cook for her with for vegetarian diet. Making sure she has food to eat and doesn’t starve. Then says he’s fake and manipulative for having most of his friends pay when they drink coffee or eat pho. When it’s his friends who are the ones that want to pay. This whole thing stemmed from my mom not liking him using taking turns paying and paying all the time wrongly. Then also thought that he was having an affair or cheating on her because he keeps mentioning my dads friends children how one’s having a good career after college and the other is taking dance classes. My father jokes and said “ I miss ____ friends wife” as like a joke but she doesn’t like jokes so she exploded today. And today for the first time I’ve actually seen my dad internally hurt by my mom’s comments. Usually he gets pissed and just stays silent but this time I could see him emotional that she would question that. She’s also said she hates that I or my dad doesn’t understand but both of us feel a sorta of condescending when she’s taking to us as if we don’t know anything at all.

I’m looking for a long-term relationship with a genuinely kind woman. Together we could have a relationship where we feel like best friends and partners. Share our favorite songs, try new foods together, find hobbies we both enjoy, and go on small side quests that turn into great memories.

I’m the guy who says the dumb jokes that make everyone laugh, but also the steady one people rely on. I can go from playful to deep conversations real quick.

I’m happiest in bookstores, coffee shops, quiet date spots, or chilling on a video call with anime or a co-op game. I’m a big foodie, and I love cooking for someone I care about.

I'm drawn to a woman who hypes the things she loves. Favorite hobbies, shows, songs. Passion is always attractive. I do have a soft spot for cute-faced, slim or athletic girls with eyes I can fall for.

I’m heading to Japan for a week in March 2026 (Tokyo + Kyoto).

Indiana-based, open to LDR in the U.S. — and open to something long-term in Japan or South Korea if it feels natural. Looking for something real, one-on-one. Age 20–26 preferred, but flexible.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I’m thoroughly introverted with a bold soul; connecting with someone who matches my energy enkindles that tendency like little else. I seek people who seek meaningful connection that plays out in several different ways, from daily casual chats to shared passions and endeavors. I appreciate the sudden whim of adventure as well.

I adore abstract minds and vibrant souls.

Rumination and contemplation are lifelong pursuits of mine. I’m an autodidact who’s been passionate about a variety of persuasions since I’ve been young.

I am 25 ( female ) I was in a relationship with a guy , ( we will call him jack ) when I was 15 we spent 8 years together I was engaged for 3 . a little back story I come from a middle class family and the guy that I was with he was really poor. when I started dating him he insisted that I should pay for everything , every date every single vacation or  trip that we have ever took.I agreed because he did not had the money, eventually it became really expensive and I had to pick up two shifts so that I can cover both of our expenses. He was abusive,  he would lay hands on me and sometimes he would call me names and make me very insecure about my body because I was a little fat


I stayed with him only because I had very narcissist parents and I did not had anyone in my family who was emotionally available towards me. So that was the only relationship that I ever knew that I felt a little warmth in , because he made me believe that he loved me.


Anyway , 6 month before my wedding  , his mom called me out of nowhere and told me that he has been cheating on me for months now. she did not wanted to tell me ( sooner ) anything because she , ( her words ) loved me a lot and she thought once i will get married , everything will fall into place and he would stop cheating on me.


But the other girl ( will call her karen ) that he was having an affair with had an abortion once and also pregnant again so she ( mil )  came into her senses and told me the truth she told me everything about the girlfriend , and surprisingly the girlfriend knows everything about me. 



I confronted Jack and told him everything I asked him why did he cheat on me and if he really wanted to get married to Karen why wouldn't he broke off the engagement or called off the wedding because that was an option. There was no remorse on Jack he just said I am glad that you have found out this way now I don't have to hide behind your back. I cannot believe that I have just got dumped after 8 years of being together.



Now when I have paid almost every expenses of other relationship and the wedding he just called off. I was really devistated I wanted to do end my life but I couldn't because I was the bread winner of my family.



I then started yoga - gym - meditation and I have tried to move on with the best way I can. I almost became a man hater. That's when I met ( robbin ) at my gym , I was 23 and he was 28 ( male ) with kind eyes , he was sweet , charming , and respected me alot , we had couple of gym sessions together , he asked me one day if I can go out with him to grab coffee sometimes , I denied respectfully he asked me the reason behind it but was very respectful about my decision , I felt sense of relief with him so I told him everything about my relationship. He listened to me without interrupting and then hugged me , he said you have been through a lot with tears in his eyes and said I completely understand if you do not trust me or you do not want to get into a relationship but we can still be friends and you can tell me about your day,  that really made me feel happy.



Since then we started seeing each other and eventually started dating , he planned dates , made efforts , loved me unconditionally, listened to me yap 2 hours a day , never made me question my choices , trusted me , got me flowers every other day , took me to movies , actually listened when I told him about my interests , planned my birthday. Gave me expensive gifts. It was a fairytale, my family knew about him.



We dated for 9 months when he asked me to get married to him I was really surprise because he himself told me that he would not rush me into anything as I was still trying to process everything , he convinced me that once we get married , he would take care of me like none other , and his love would change me , I did not wanted to agree but I did , maybe it was desperation , maybe it was my stupidity. ( I SAID YES ) , but on one condition , that we would atleast be with eachother for 2 years before getting married, he reluctantly agreed.



A year go by , on our 1 anniversary, he kind of seamed off I asked him about his work and everything but he did not give me any answer and just said that he was tired, he stopped working out with me stop the yoga sessions and eventually he stopped speaking to me on calls like he used to , I felt that he was trying to distance himself from me but I could not find any reason why ???



So I sat him down and asked him if I did something wrong or was he offended by anything or did I do something that really made him react this way to which he replied I didn't do anything but he is facing a lot of losses in his business and this is why he is little stressed,  I tried to help him out as much as I can but he Denied every single effort that I made and said that he would be okay on his own he just need some time.



I did not wanted to nag him every now and then so I have stop giving him any ideas on his business and thought that maybe once his business makes profits he would be with me like he used to before.




That's when I met one of his subordinate ( harry ) at a dental clinic, we were both waiting for our dr , so I chit chat a little, to my surprise he never faced any of the losses that he have talked about, in fact business was booming and they all received a fat bonus at work. It made me wonder that why would he lie to me , harry also told me that he loved the vacation that robbin took me to a couple weeks ago , I ask , what vacation , he said the one he proposed you at , I was utterly shocked , bcz robbin proposed to me at my apartment , not any fancy villa that harry is talking about, ( ps : harry and the other team member only saw the photos of the villa and knew the location , they did not see any photos of us together ) 


I was about to throw up , I left the clinic and came home , talked to one of my friends about it , she said he must be cheating on you. I could not deny all the allegations, but I did not had any proofs about him cheating , that's when I started noticing patterns , the lies , the false promises , everything.


I acted very calm whenever I used to meet robbin , he did not sense any tension between us bcz he was too busy celebrating his victory and thought I would never find out.


He left his phone with me one day by accident, when he left to fill gas , that's when I looked into his phone ( I knew the password bcz it was my birthday - yeah pathetic i know ) , and what I saw blew my mind , he had an affair long before he met me , so basically I was the other women , their relationship was of 5 years , and yes he did proposed to her right after me with almost an identical ring like mine , I was crushed. But took screenshots of everything.



He came back and grabbed his phone , I heard his car and before he could jump in - to get his phone I was already in my kitchen , so he did not suspected anything, gave me a forehead kiss and told me he loved me and said he would see me on weekend, i swolled my anger and acted nice. I threw up when he left , his touch made me uncomfortable. 


I checked the instagram profile of the women he was seeing before me ( with a completely fake profile of henna artist i created ) and started following her , one day i  asked her if she would be up to do henna for free for my business, she agreed on the spot , i met with her at a local coffee shop downtown owned by my uncle , she didn't recognised me , i could not keep it in , told her everything , showed her every picture , flowers that he bought for me and what not , to my surprise she was sad but was not surprised, I held her hand and asked her if she knew anything about me.



She said no. I did not , but i had a feeling that he was seeing somebody else , I asked what she would do from here , she said , she will be with him no matter what , turns out they were arranged to get married by both or their families to collaborate a business deal , and she have already accepted her fate , I tried to talk her out of it , but she was firm , I left the location , apparently she never told robbin that she met me , and continued their relationship , they are set to get married in within a month.



I on the other hand , betrayed, left alone , confronted robbin about it. He cried , almost fainted and asked for forgiveness , told me he only loved me and ( her ) was just a business deal he couldn't say no to , he would always chose me even after he gets married to her , i snapped out of it and told him A BIG NO , he can but I cannot , slapped him and left the room.



He tried to call , text but I blocked him on all the platforms, he tried to reach my family but I told them about it as well .


I am trying to heal and get myself together, but as I live in India and I am already 25 , comes from a very conservative muslim family , they want me to get married ( arranged ) asap , the thought of getting married makes me sick to my stomach, I tried to deny everytime they bring it up , but they won't take no for an answer , I have so much student loans and debt to pay bcz of my wedding expenses and other relationship expenses, health is deteriorting everyday , I don't feel like leaving the bed , seeing a therapist now , i don't recognise myself in the mirror , I hate myself for believing in him , and don't know what to do from here , any suggestions would help , if any questions , please let me know!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pgxzsh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1pgxzsh/update_5moish_later_starting_to_do_a_little/,"Update 5mo-ish later: Starting to do a little better - time, community/friends, meditation do help","I'm 5ish months out of my DA discard after 5 years together and thinking he was my person. We'd started doing fiance visa paperwork. He was a filmmaker finishing his second feature film, which I'd been supporting him through for as long as I've known him, and he dropped me just as he was finishing it -- he ghosted me for two months, claiming he ""wasn't ignoring me"" when he was already preparing for the premier without me. Three years ago I bought him a silk pocket square for whenever he finished it and for his premier, not knowing when it might happen..... He had his premier, and I can only imagine that he was happy to be solitary, mysterious, distant, charming and available, and not have the woman who saw him through all of his anxiety, procrastination, fuckups, big and little embarrassments, etc., nearby.

I'm not great, I'm still struggling with periodic extreme anger and the unfulfilled desire for acknowledgment and apology, but a lot of the shock that the person I knew could turn out like this has subsided. The sadness has also gotten softer: I'm sad, feel lonely, alone, scared I'll remain this way (37F), and feel like something big in my life is missing, but I'm not in acute heartbreak. (EXCEPT sometimes, when I just get down and can't shake it. I'm not actively sobbing and grieving.) I definitely no longer actively miss having him in my life, knowing what's going on with his, or sharing activities with him -- disgust and anger have made me feel repulsed by him. At times, I miss feeling cared for, secure, the feeling that took years to build that this was my person and I was lucky to have found someone I felt actively in love with despite the years -- fun, attractive, and other things I hadn't dreamed would be so ""live"" still. But that person, for reasons that are mysterious to me and unchangeable, is gone, and was probably gone for some time time before I noticed. I was fighting to repair some things that felt like lagging attention from my partner and being taken for granted and underappreciated. I hope I have the strength in the future never to fall for that trap. So I mourn that person and that feeling, but I don't want anything to do with the real and existing person who is my ex: that real man is hurtful, cowardly, self-interested, and profoundly limited, first by trauma and then by the choice as an adult to runaway from it when he knows there's something wrong. When I think of him, I wonder if he doesn't feel ashamed of himself or embarassed to travel in our old circles.

My friends have been the biggest support -- listening to me talk, being so empathetic, keeping me company by call or text when I can't find folks in person, reassuring me, cheering me on when I've had good days or small achievements on my own as a single person without someone else to rely on now, checking on me, reflecting back to me how badly I was treated and how much I deserve to be chosen. Reading in this group and some others, as well as listening to a LOT of self-help during the most acute periods during the first 1-3 mo, and ongoing daily meditations from Insight Timer, especially those around heartbreak, attachment, breakup, etc., have helped me a lot.

I've been feeling very much like an ugly duckling, which began with my ex avoiding sex for the last two years of our relationship--reopening an old wound about self-confidence--and then worsened by my comforting/punishing myself with junk food and gaining a fair amount of weight in the last year I haven't yet been able to shake off. I haven't been entirely sure how I would start to heal this part of myself. I felt too raw to think of approaching dates or swipe on an app or anything remotely sexual or romantic without feeling loved and cared for, because it felt like love would be the only thing that could ""look past"" my frumpy appearance and present vibe. I couldn't imagine going out dancing while feeling so insecure.

But tonight, my friends, out at a cafe with a group of friends, very low pressure and not sexy....I was very clearly asked out by a friend of a friend who joined us for the first time. This is someone I presumed was well out of my league, and he pointedly got my number, and a few hours after, sent me a warm message about meeting and asked me for a drink or coffee. This is someone who doesn't quite seem to have his life together, so isn't a long-term prospect, but is warm, attuned, shares similar interests. The ""doesn't have his life together"" bit is about work/finances and what seemed like pretty high anxiety, neither of which I can afford to invite into my life. I haven't decided whether to take him up on a meeting, but I can say this did my bruised little ego a lot of good. A real live human, one interested in me--not running to stay just out of reach--and a sexy kickboxing human at that.

An update both for myself and for those who are in the acute days and can't imagine it's endurable. I still feel like I lost something huge and precious from my life, that I loved having, that filled my life more than what I've yet been able to build for myself, but I no longer feel like having it back is a remote possibility, which helps ease the pain of ""why doesn't he want me?"" and ""why won't he work harder to fix himself?"" and other conflict.",1,1765152901.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

We have a tradition of the kids waking up to find gifts around the tree and spending morning opening them. We sip coffee while we watch the joy and paper fly. Then as I work on tidying the chaos, my husband makes breakfast. After this my parents stop by for an hour and we finish day at relatives. Mother-in-law gets a day with us and husbands siblings that is determined by everyone’s schedules. Usually within a day or two of the actual holiday. We will spend most of the day there visiting and having a meal.
Mother-in-law is not fulfilled by this though. She wants to come spend Christmas morning at our house watching the kids open Santa gifts. She is big on guilt trips and makes comments on how she misses the chaos. She has been posting leading stories, obviously directed at us, about lonely cold left out grandparents on Christmas. She is not alone. For most of our children’s lives she had her husband, and now she has moved on to a boyfriend. Definitely not waking up alone.
We don’t have a close relationship. She is difficult and we are very different personalities. There has been tension the past few years over an incident that has pushed us even further apart. She can go months without calling and asking about the kids.
We just want our Christmas morning to be ours. We have both always pictured it to be this way. She can stop by after if she would like. We would honestly prefer she didn’t beings we will be spending time with her within a day or two and don’t enjoy her company.

tangina. ang sakit pota. idk if you feel the same way. tangina. but fuck, a random memory popped up. out of nowhere. as i wake up. fuck. 

i remember going to MCS, having this mundane moment of thrift shopping. you keeping asking me to tone down my conyoness bc it would make you have worse deals. i remember walking towards a coffee shop around the boundaries of manila and makati. i remember expressing my doubts a day before judgement day. and it wasnt our plan. but you reassured me. FUCK YOU REASSURED ME. 

you reassured me. you reassured me. you reassured me. 

those tender moments would be the fucking death of me. what about all the instragram posts you pinned? the plans we havent made? fuck. fuck. fuck. fuckk. fuckkk. 

idk if you feel it too. idk if the love affair maims you too. idk how you feel rn. bc i feel somewhat that you don’t… care anymore. 

why? the weeks after breakup you were also reeling. ffs, you asked me the week after we breakup, when you allowed me to enter drunk on ur unit, “next week?” 

i didnt know how to feel abt that back then. but eh, i went anyway. i thought that’s gonna be our rhythm. every week we reconvene to process together. still have distance. 

but fuck idk whats gotten to you the past week. you just out of nowhere say “i dont think its healthy we meet together weeks after the breakup”??? AFTER YOU SET UP THIS RHYHTM??? FFS ELI 

thats why i got my guitar back. thats why i killed Liham. thats why i made a clean break this time. bc *you* seem to want that. this is what you wanted right? after weeks of slowly erasing the breakup impact, openly talking about how we feel, where we are. you wanted to actually not do that

so fucking stupid to be writing knowing all too well you’d not be thinking of me anw.

haahhaha tangina. i fucking swear this god-writer is just straight up messing w me. bc why tf am i just going ti the gym only to hear fucking someone play eternal sunshine? your fave album from ur fucking fave artist   

im not even mad anymore. not as just earlier morning. im just laughing. idk if you have the same experience, eli. if you hear me in ur unit. if you can see me in taft. or smell my distinct conconction of scents.

haha i already submitted my screenwriting application. also, was able to register for the storycrafting workshop haha. bahala na kung matanggap man o hindi. ang mahalaga, sinubukan pa rin. 

alam mo, napagtanto ko lang din. sa mga huling linggo bago akong tuluyang kumawala, parang di ko naman hinihingi maging tayo eh. mas kinakailangan ko ng kaibigan noon. sa parehong paraang na iniiisip mong kinakailangan ng ex mo ng kaibigan ngayon. kaya ganon naging reaksyon ko. para bang nawala yung ibang parte ng sarili ko. 

isinulat ko nga sa creative intro ko sa application:
I felt like I had to amputate my Filipino identity once again. Because bearing that part also means bearing the ghost of you. And I can’t grieve a ghost forever.

kaya ewan, you killed the connection. and i had to learn how to be filipino again by myself. 

going to workshops, writing more, watching more, reading more. all without you. 

im planning to join the 30th rally too. i was thinking whether i should contact you. but i decided against it haha

the ball has always been at your court. and im patiently waiting. bc i did love you

haha i should time my entries—5:45pm
ewan ko ba sa adhd ko bakit pinilit kong magbasa ng kulang na silya kasya sa paggawa ng final take-home exams ko na due yesterday at final exams ko naman sa isa pang course na due today haha

i wasn’t even thinking of you or the relationship. my body just led me there. to the library. reading the next essay. 

anyway, parang ang cool pala ni ricky lee no? the way he talks about writing and stories, it really is inspiring. 

alam mo… sinabi ko sa sarili ko, ‘pag natanggap ako sa workshop, iiyak talaga ako haha. to be before THE ricky lee?

pero naisip ko rin, do i contact you? ibabahagi ko ba ang balita? o sapat na isulat dito sa journal na hindi makakarating sa’yo hanggang sa tamang panahon. what if ito ang tamang panahon?

i wish we could talk about it. i miss you.

i wonder if you’re thinking of me too haha

haha there was this contest in the workshop. haha i won. 

idk i felt a sense of pride knowing i did it without you. like my growth as a filipino creative is not tied to anyone but myself. 

but again, i cant really deny the impact you had on me. thank you for suggesting this workshop. thank you for being the spark that led me to write more, feel more, be more in filipino. 

i really cant take that away.

i saw you look through my story. not even in your main account where you follow me. but ur dump account that i knew and confirmed was you a long time ago. 

why? were you curious? was it just a glitch? a bug by IG?

i wasnt even thinking of you when i posted. and you showed up unannounced. it’s not unwelcomed. it’s jus surprising haha

i miss you

3:50 pm
i attended the rally. ive had a lot of feelings and emotions and thoughts. i wish i could’ve talked to you about it haha

i also met a guy haha. he’s cute. dont know if hes straight tho haha he’s giving straight. esp that he told me that hes a devout catholic. tho i feel like we had great vulnerable conversations. 

lowkey after the whole thing, it reminded me of us. before. like who tf talks about being lost in life after meeting once lol. hes a comsci major too. and we also talked about feeling like the tech field is so cold and then inhumane. and we’re both trying to find humanity in such a cold space. oh and he’s ilonggo too haha

thats not the point of the rally tho haha idk, again this feels like a threshold moment for me. as i gotten more into this identity that i want to explore. where you used to be this northern star. you used to be my guidance. 

i keep asking myself why i wanted to go. a part of me is selfish—i did it to prove a point, that i can do it without you. so i had to recalibrate, ask myself why i wanted to be like you to begin with. 

and there it goes, when you’ve been hurt for a long time, you expand your capacity for empathy. it makes sense. you wouldn’t want others to feel the pain that you accrued in your years. so you try your best to make the world a better place. now thats a more noble motivation haha

anw, fuck all corrupt officials. i hope they rot in jail

i just finished Kalahating Bahaghari… Part One hahahahahha

but honestly i love the pace. i live my life as is. and every time i start reading again, it feels like im catching up with my old friends. and we’re all living life in parallel. its a very comfy feeling to have grown with the characters. every time i pick up the book, im also a slightly different person

also i feel like i have to press charges to ricky lee… for psychologic damage LOL man, those last two chapters were brutal; i tried withholding crying bc i was in public lol

dec. 3
2 am
you were in Telegram after you said:
Anyway, I’ll probs go ahead na. I hope the past few weeks have been kind to you as well. Good luck with finals! 

why? who were you talking to? i thought you were tired? idk haha

idk what im feeling. 


dec. 4
11:00 am
i shouldn’t prolly do this but i checked your Last Seen indicator in Telegram. again, 2am. 

i think im lowkey scared and anxious. that you’re talking with someone new. maybe ur ex. maybe someone from reddit who caught ur eye. idk, i know i’ve also been going out, talking to people, maybe hooking up. not to replace stillness,  reflection, and processing but to expand my life.

idk if that makes sense. for the past weeks, i have been in cycles of expansion and contraction. i contract, retreat to solitude to get a sense of myself. to hear myself after all this noise. and once i feel full and ready to take on the world, i expand. reach out. contraction makes me realize my needs and wants. “i could really use someone who’s interested in films like i do” “i wanna explore sex again” and so i reached out to people. until something triggers me again and contract. it gets better tho. 

still, even with that knowledge, i still can’t help but feel something when i see you potentially having someone else. i don’t wanna lose you. but idk, i feel like we had to. 

fuck, i love you, eli. i miss you so bad. 


dec. 7
8:15 am 
i’m starting to miss you again

idk how much else i’m gonna process all this. prolly a few more weeks. idk, it doesn’t have a fixed timeline

this might be the last time im writing to you. so im just gonna vomit everything that i’ve been pondering this past weeks

idk, i want to move forward. maybe i’ll post it somewhere you can find… by fate. and if fate allows it, the ball would be on your court if you’re gonna do anything abt it… like it’s always been

i’m thinking about the things i’ve learned, things i’ve noticed. i think one thing that made me really blindsided about you suddenly wanting actual space is the things you said. “maybe we already learned the lessons we need to learn from each other” it’s like the first week we broke up. it’s like a surrender, you believe that it’s the end. whereas the weeks after the breakup, you were still lingering in my orbit, we were lingering in each other’s orbit haha

idk if im coherent. its just

contradictory and very complicated. and i dont think i can unspool this complicated thread. at the end, you’re still not here. 

sometimes i think whether there were signs of these before. you weren’t really forward about your interest or attraction towards me. at least at the start. 

but idk, september felt different. i felt like you were actually expressing your interest. i felt pursued. i felt loved. idk what happened

or maybe i do. that’s one thing i realized for the past two relationships i’ve been in (including ours). when one person in a relationship is in crisis, the other can hold space. i wasn’t anxiously attached before the second to the last relationship. or at least not as severe as after its fallout. 

my ex withdrew a lot early in the relationship and while it did make me uneasy, i can live my day without spiraling. and i can be thoughtful and empathetic to his needs. 

i feel the same way with you. i can be as patient as i can be around august and september. 

but idk, during october and the succeeding months, we were both in crisis. we had to save ourselves before attending to each other. there’s no room for patience or understanding or empathy. we were in survival mode. so we had to break haha

i guess my question now is if it’s a break or a breakup. but based on our last conversation, i feel like you’re leaning with the latter haha

idek if i honestly think this is salvageable. 

i guess i also need more healing. i need to expand my circle to include people whose role you historically filled in my life. social science. film. filipino culture. queer culture. urbanism. 

that way, i’m okay with proceeding on my own. if we go back together (and thats a big if haha), i don’t go to you for everything missing/incomplete in my life. you could fill some of it but the relationship wouldn’t hinge on it solely. 

idk, there’s probably more thoughts and feelings i have for this relationship. more processing to do. but im gonna pull the plug here.

thank you for being a huge part of my life despite being in just a short time.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

A couple of my friends and I have been talking and trying to build a small, mixed group of friends (men and women) who want to hang out, explore the area, and actually keep the momentum going. I have friends in North Jersey/Central but it’s much harder to make plans that works for everyone since it can be a much longer drive and more planning involved so this would be preferably South Jersey. 

Some interests that mix between all of us include, Gundam, Persona series video games, Kamen rider, tokusatu, Star Wars, Anime, Marvel/DC, comics, building models (airplanes, tanks, cars, gundam, Pokémon) video games, walking, food/coffee/drinks. 

We’re all in South Jersey and hoping to find people roughly within 30 minutes of each other so it’s easy to meet up without anyone traveling an hour every time. Not looking for anything huge, just a chill, dependable,tight knit group of adults who like hanging out and doing casual activities! Towns that we live in: Haddonfield, Deptford, Clementon areas. 

We’re thinking things like:
• coffee shops, diners, or breweries
• movie nights or game nights 
• building models 
• easy hikes/parks
• going to events like Comic Cons and other similar cons
• checking out hobby shops, antique stores, and toy shops
• maybe taking the train into Philly for a day out
• random meet ups after work/weekends

If you’re in SNJ and want to make new friends, comment or DM! Age doesn’t matter too much except be 18+ but we are all within our late twenties to late thirties.

1pgxqjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pgxqjf/dae_notice_many_young_men_almost_never_talk_about/,DAE notice: many young men almost never talk about their girlfriends/wives?,"This is just a random mid 20s observation, but I wondered if anybody else has had this experience.

So, I'm friends with a lot of men, either through work or hobby groups. I'm asexual and utterly disinterested in relationships, which I think puts me in a unique space where I am not ""one of the boys"" but I am also not ""female competiton/a threat"", and this means I end up spending a lot of one on one time with partnered men. These relationships are generally interesting, fulfilling, and consistent of plenty of chitchat, having casual coffee some workdays, maybe playing videogames on a rainy day, and so on. 

Lately I can't help but notice... despite many of these men being in VERY committed and long term relationships... and despite my spending a large amount of time with them just *talking*... they almost never talk about their female partners? Even in a passing mention?

When I have coffee with the women in my life, their partners always inevitably end up in the conversation. First it'll be something like them saying: ""me and my partner did this"", which then leads to my asking ""oh yeah, how is he?"", which may then lead to some more general relationship talk. Their partners are clearly part of their life, on their mind, and that shows through in the way they speak.

... But with the men, when I ask what they've been up to, it's always: ""*I* did this"". ""I"" and ""me"", and not ""Us"" and ""we"". They never volunteer information about their girlfriend/wife. I have to really specifically ask questions, and when I do I get minimal information. (The same cannot be said for their male friendships - I always end up hearing a lot about bromance and bro rivalries, so it's not a matter of them just not talking about people/relationships more generally.)

It's skeeving me out to have noticed, frankly. It's making me feel like they don't see their partners as full and complete people in their own right, and instead as accessories to their lives that don't even bare mentioning. I don't like it one bit.

The DMV in our town, like all towns in the rural Midwest, is a sticky, humid pocket of the worst humanity has to offer.

If you think I'm overselling it, it's only a matter of time until you realize it on your own time. The price of freedom is and always will be a morning locked in that terrible, squalid little building just on the outskirts of my dying rural Michigan town. You'll know what I mean when you go there, too. It's a special hell, breathing through the smell of burnt coffee and sour sweat until your ticket is called and your nightmare ends.

I thought, that random Saturday in May, that the warm, freshly printed license in my palm would mean that I had earned myself another four years. Forty-eight blissful months without thinking about the receptionist and the stench of rot that clung to her like a rancid film to her pastel cardigan.

I should've known better than to think I would get off that easy.

If I were the lucky sort, I wouldn't have had to go in in the first place. After all, you can do half this shit online, now. The magic of technology, even in a place as slow and backward as this.

But the damn bureaucrats in Lansing told them you have to get a new photo when yours gets old enough, and ding ding ding, I'm old enough now. I get it. It's not like I look the same I did when I was sixteen, but I've got a camera on my phone for a reason, don't I?

So I took that Saturday off. I dragged my old, tired beater of a car up to the single-story building in the early morning hours, before even the birds were awake, and parked beside the rest of the dredges who were forced to be here instead of somewhere else worth being.

A full house, even this early. Rows and rows of old and young, curled in on themselves, dry, tired eyes staring vacantly at phones and paperwork. No one spoke, not even the kids. It was too awful to bother in a place like this.

The only seat left was one in the back, which I took gratefully. Not even that was guaranteed, here.

I had an appointment, but that didn't mean shit here when there were two people working and dozens on the schedule. So I waited, the tedious feeling of time slipping through my pale fingers, the light filtering -- pale and unsettling -- through the smudged, dusty windows.

\[NOW SERVING NUMBER 117\]

Me. Finally. I happily relinquished my spot near the bathroom and slid into the seat across from the only man on staff today.

He was older. Serious. His bulbous, dark eyes were nestled behind greasy, drooping eyelids and pockmarked cheeks. He'd seen better days, but he seemed nice enough, all things considered. I could see a picture of his family teetering on the edge of his desk, their faces grim and ashen.

""Do you have the paperwork filled out?"" He asked, voice low and dispassionate. I handed it over along with my old license, and he set to work.

""We'll need a new picture,"" he said.

I swallowed back a wave of nausea, the stale, sticky air making me want to peel back my own skin just to shake it loose. ""That's fine.""

He lined me up in front of the old camera, took a serviceable photo, and nodded.

""When can I expect it in the mail?""

The man looked at me a bit strangely, but waved me away. ""Please go sit back down. We can print re-issued licenses in good standing here in the office, now. New policy.""

I wasn't exactly excited to wait, but it was better than risking it get lost in the mail. I'd walk out of here without a DMV in my future until after I turned thirty, and that was enough to make me smile a little.

It took 20 minutes for it to be delivered by the receptionist with the unlaundered cardigan. There was something pale and solid in the corner of her lips. I couldn't take my eyes off of it as she handed me my card.

""Have a good day,"" she said, croaking and dismissive.

I took it without looking and hustled out to my car, taking great, heaving lungfuls of the clean late morning air.

I didn't look at my license until I got home. Maybe that was the first mistake. Or maybe my first mistake was taking it at all, instead of insisting they mail it to me and forgo that terrible new printer they kept sequestered in the back.

I'd already tossed my keys on the side table by the time I remembered my license, tucked in my pocket, and the empty space in my wallet where I belonged.

The thing was, I shouldn't have looked. But I was curious. After all, they didn't give you heads or tails about what the photo looked like, only took it and printed it across this thing that would live on your person for a decade, until you looked old, and worse, and had to visit their abysmal cesspool of stink and boredom all over again.

So I looked.

It was a fine photo of me. I looked like any other twenty-eight year old who never left their dead-end home town. Tired. A little rough around the edges. My skin was blessedly clear, and my hair only looked half as limp and greasy as it actually was, since I'd forgotten to shower after work yesterday.

Then, I saw it.

The first time, I figured it was a trick of the light. Maybe a side-effect of my early morning wake-up call, and several hours doing nothing but stare at my cracked phone screen as I played whatever idle game I'd gotten hooked on this week.

Because there was no way it was real.

Photos didn't blink. Their eyes, *my* eyes, didn't dart, lightning-quick and suspicious, in a sweeping arc around my desolate living room.

They didn't catch you looking.

There was an empty, terrifying vacancy when you held eyes with a photograph. With your own photograph. As though someone had washed the inside of you clean and put you back together, leaving you off-balance and hollow, with nothing left to ground you.

I shook the license, drawing a sharp breath and checking again.

The photo looked. Slower, this time. Appraising, as it took in my scant belongings and the cracks that littered the drywall of my shitty, low-income apartment.

I dropped it with a yelp and took a step back, breathing slow and even.

It was a trick. Surely it was. I was tired, or seeing things.

I let myself have the luxury of a few more seconds of panic, steadying myself against the arm of my couch before reaching out a shaky hand to pick it back up.

The photo was as still as it should have been. Just me, a little tired, a snapshot of a morning that could have been better spent anywhere else.

I tucked it away in my wallet, throwing it into the couch and beelining for my room.

I needed to sleep. If anything, this just proved it.

I've been working on this walnut coffee table for a while and am finally in the finishing stages. I wanted a really smooth finish, so I used Aqua Coat grain filler on all surfaces, and now after 3-4 coats, I'm starting to apply the final finish: wipe on oil based poly that I mixed myself 50/50 with mineral oil. I've previously only used water based poly so this is the first time with oil based.

The problem I'm noticing is that the surface seems to be a bit blotchy. Wherever there was a lot of Aqua Coat left behind after sanding I notice it's lighter than where there is little or none (the bottom of the surface I didn't use grain filler).

Is this normal? ChatGPT keeps saying not to worry and after 3-4 coats it will start to even out... But I also seem to be reading folks saying I should have added a coat of dewaxed shellac before the oil based poly.

Should I trust in the process (and ChatGPT) and keep adding layers? Or should I panic and sand down and add in the dewaxed shellac?",1,1765152088.0,BeginnerWoodWorking,1,1.0,False

1pgxmux,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1pgxmux/how_to_be_extremely_confident_even_if_youre_quiet/,How to be extremely confident even if you're quiet (what 10 years of studying people taught me),"I used to think confidence meant being loud, charismatic, the life of the party.

Then I spent a decade watching how the most respected people in rooms actually behave. The pattern I found changed everything: the quietest person often held the most power.

Real confidence isn't loud. It's calm, controlled, and magnetic in a way most people can't explain.

Here's what I learned:

1. Silence is your superpower, not your weakness

Most people panic when conversation stops. They rush to fill every gap with words, jokes, anything to avoid awkwardness.

Let it breathe.

When someone asks you a question, pause for two seconds before responding. Sounds simple but it does something powerful it shows you're thinking, not performing. People unconsciously read this as high status.

I watched this happen in a meeting last week. Guy got asked a tough question. Counted to two. Then answered calmly. Everyone leaned in. The person who immediately word-vomited right after was forgotten in seconds.

2. Your body language talks louder than your mouth

Quiet confident people move differently. They're slower. More deliberate.

Next time you reach for your coffee, move 20% slower than your impulse tells you. When you walk somewhere, reduce your pace slightly. Rushed movement screams anxiety. Unhurried movement whispers control when you slow down physically, your nervous system actually calms down. Your body language doesn't just communicate to others. It communicates to you.

Stand like you own your space. Feet shoulder-width. Shoulders back but relaxed. Not aggressive, just grounded. Take up the room you're entitled to without apology.

3. Say less, mean more

I used to think I needed to contribute to every conversation to be valued. Wrong. Quiet confident people are selective. They speak when it adds value, not just to be heard.

Before you talk, ask yourself: Does this need to be said? Does it need to be said by me? Does it need to be said now?

When you DO speak, cut the fluff:

* ""Let's try a different approach"" beats ""Um, I was kind of thinking maybe we could try something else?""
* ""I disagree"" beats ""I don't know, I guess I see it differently, but maybe I'm wrong""

People remember the person who said three meaningful things, not the person who said thirty forgettable ones.

4. Master the strategic pause

This changed everything for me. When you finish making a point, stop talking. Don't explain further. Don't soften it. Just let it land.

Most people get uncomfortable and keep talking, which dilutes their message. You staying quiet after making your point is confidence. Silence makes people think about what you said instead of waiting for you to finish so they can talk.

5. React less than everyone else

Quiet confident people consistently under-react compared to the room. Someone tells a funny story and everyone's laughing loud? You smile genuinely but don't perform it. Someone shares exciting news and people are gasping? You say ""That's great"" with controlled enthusiasm.

Plus when you DO show big emotion, it carries weight because it's rare. Your excitement becomes valuable because you don't give it to everything.

6. Have strong opinions you state calmly

This is what separates quiet confidence from just being shy. Shy people avoid stating opinions because they fear judgment. Quiet confident people have clear views they're willing to share without aggression.

You can say ""I completely disagree with that approach"" in a measured, calm tone. The delivery makes the strong stance even more powerful. You're not trying to convince anyone or win an argument. You're just stating your truth.

I've watched this play out hundreds of times people respect clear positions even when they disagree. Wishy-washy stances get dismissed immediately.

7. Control your attention like it's currency

Your attention is valuable. Treat it that way.

When someone's talking to you, turn your full body toward them. Don't let your eyes scan the room. Don't check your phone. Be fully present for those two minutes.

People will remember you as one of the best conversationalists they've met. Not because you said anything profound, but because you actually listened. Almost nobody does this anymore.

also know when to withdraw attention. If a conversation isn't valuable or someone's being disrespectful, politely exit. Your time has boundaries. That's self-respect, and people can feel it.

8. Don't overshare - create layers

Most people anxiety-dump their entire life story trying to create connection. Quiet confident people reveal information slowly.

Surface level stuff first - where you're from, what you do. Then interests and perspectives as rapport builds. Deep vulnerabilities and dreams? Only with people who've earned it.

Scarcity creates value. When you don't give everything away in the first conversation, people become more curious about you. Mystery is magnetic.

9. Stay calm when people try to rattle you

Someone insults you? ""Interesting take"" with a slight smile. Someone tries to one-up you? ""Good for you"" with genuine neutrality. Someone baits you into arguing? ""I see it differently"" and move on.

Reactive people give their power away. When you can't be baited, you can't be controlled.

This is genuine calm that comes from being secure enough that other people's opinions don't shake you.

10. Build real competence in private

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: You can't fake deep confidence.

But you CAN build it by getting genuinely good at things when nobody's watching. Every skill you master in private adds to your foundation.

Lift weights until you're objectively strong. Learn something until you're objectively competent. Build something until it objectively works.

Confidence is just self-trust. Self-trust comes from evidence. Evidence comes from doing hard things and succeeding. Stack enough of that, and you walk into any room with unshakeable calm.

What this looks like in practice:

You walk into a room. You move deliberately. You observe before jumping in. Your phone stays in your pocket. When someone speaks to you, you give them your full attention. When you speak, every word counts. When there's silence, you're comfortable in it.

People can't explain why they're drawn to you. They just are.

Quiet confidence isn't about being invisible. It's about being so secure you don't need constant validation.

The old stone streets, salty Adriatic breeze, random Roman columns just lying around, and then these super modern art/architecture pieces right on the water… it’s such a weird but perfect mix.

Here are the spots that stood out the most:

**10. Sea Organ (Morske orgulje)**  
A set of marble steps on the promenade that literally plays music using the waves. You just sit down, stare at the sea, and the water pushes air through pipes hidden under the steps, creating this haunting, relaxing sound.

* **Price:** Free
* **When to go:** Sunset for max vibes 🌅

**9. Greeting to the Sun**  
Right next to the Sea Organ, it’s a big solar-powered circle in the pavement that lights up after dark. At night it turns into this colorful, moving light show under your feet, with the Sea Organ soundtrack in the background.

* **Price:** Free
* **When to go:** After sunset / in the evening

**8. Zadar Archaeological Museum**  
If you like context for all the ruins you’re seeing outside, this museum is worth a couple of hours. Roman sculptures, medieval relics, everyday objects – it gives you a good sense of how long this place has been important.

* **Price:** Cheap (around a few euros)
* **When to go:** Morning, before it gets too hot / crowded

**7. Roman Forum**  
Ruins from the 1st century BC right in the middle of town. You literally just walk among old columns and foundations with cafés and churches around you. It’s one of those places where it’s easy to just sit, people-watch, and imagine what this used to look like 2,000 years ago.

* **Price:** Free
* **When to go:** Afternoon

**6. St. Donatus Church**  
Round, chunky, very photogenic church and one of Zadar’s main symbols. The inside is simple but atmospheric, and they sometimes host concerts there because of the acoustics. Even if you don’t go in, the exterior is worth a look.

* **Price:** Small entry fee
* **When to go:** Midday, when you’re already exploring the Forum area

**5. Zadar City Walls**  
You can walk along parts of the old defensive walls and get great views of the sea and the city. It’s not some super intense hike – more like a chill walk with lots of photo stops.

* **Price:** Mostly free
* **When to go:** Late afternoon / golden hour

**4. Kolovare Beach**  
Closest “proper” beach to the center. Clear water, places to sunbathe, and easy to just wander down for a swim without planning a full beach day.

* **Price:** Free
* **When to go:** Summer, obviously – mornings or late afternoon are nicest

**3. Five Wells Square (Trg pet bunara)**  
Small historic square with exactly what the name says – five old wells in a row. It’s surrounded by cafés and a good place to just sit with a coffee or ice cream and take a break from walking.

* **Price:** Free
* **When to go:** Midday coffee break spot

**2. Museum of Illusions**  
Pure fun. It’s one of those interactive places with rooms that mess with your sense of size and balance, mirror tricks, optical illusions etc. Good if you’re tired of “old stones” and want something playful, especially if you’re with kids or friends.

* **Price:** Mid-range (think \~8–10 USD)
* **When to go:** Any time / also good as a rainy-day option

**1. Zadar Old Town**  
The heart of everything. Narrow streets, random Roman pieces, churches, small squares, and a ton of cafés and bars. You basically just wander with no plan: stop for coffee, walk to the sea, get lost, find another pretty street, repeat.

* **Price:** Walking is free, coffee is not 😄
* **When to go:** All day and evening – it feels different at each time

**Need-to-know tips:**

* Try the local seafood at waterfront restaurants – it’s genuinely good, not just “tourist view” places.
* Off-season (spring / autumn) = fewer crowds, still great weather.
* Bring comfy shoes, you’ll walk a lot on stone and cobblestones.
* Check out local markets for fresh fruit, veggies, and snacks – cheap and fun way to feel a bit less touristy.

If anyone’s been to Zadar recently and has restaurant/bar/hidden spot recommendations, drop them below – I’m definitely going back at some point.

I work remote, am single (but ready to get my heart broken again lol), and have no pets (but I do see a dog in my future). I’m looking to be in an area that’s safe, has a few walkable coffee shops/restaurants, and isn’t too young but also isn’t all families. Budget is up to $2,750 for a 2bed/1bath or 1 bed/1 bath + parking. I was in town recently and loved South Pearl St but am curious if there are any other suggestions. 

I lived in DC for a long time which has a big fitness scene and I made a ton of friends over the years through my gym. So if anyone has any gym recommendations in the neighborhood they suggest, that would be a bonus! Ideally not CrossFit, but a strength-based HIIT gym with classes that’s welcoming and social (and isn’t all 20-something). 

And as far as the mountains go, I don’t ski but I hike a ton and know there are trails in every which way direction, so mountain access isn’t a top priority.

A looooooooong time ago, I read a story where Grayson is over in Seattle or Portland (I think) on business and encounters Roth in a business that she owned or managed. They talk over coffee, as one does in fanfiction, and she agrees to travel back to Gotham for a visit, staying at Stately Wayne Manor.

I recall she meets the Batfam in whatever line-up was in that particular story and winds up getting involved in some sort of investigation, taking up her Raven persona once more and adventuring across Gotham and perhaps into Bludhaven.

A lot of other details escape my memory, with the exception that I found it an interesting character study without any over-the-top sensationalistic trope-festing.

With the scant details I can recall, searching on AO3 and FFN (and other sites, frankly) is challenging, seeing that text-within-work keyword searches aren't available. I can't recall under which source/media it was filed: Young Justice, Teen Titans variant, Justice League, Batman variant, Nightwing... or whatever. It's one of the stories I regret not downloading, but I read it many moons before I began religiously downloading works of fanfiction.

Anyway, on the off chance that these few story elements spark a memory in someone, please respond with any further clues you might add to its title and/or hosting website.",1,1765151779.0,Nightwing,1,1.0,False

Held a full baguette-diamond rose gold Jacob & Co. Epic SF24 Tourbillon today.
•  Flying tourbillon at 9
•  Mechanical split-flap 24-city world time on top (yes, actual flipping flaps like an old airport board)
•  Every visible surface absolutely drowned in diamonds
•  Retail somewhere around $1.3 million depending on the exact stone count
Functionally it’s a tourbillon with a very clever (and very loud) world-time complication. Aesthetically it’s the horological equivalent of a gold-plated Bugatti with neon underglow pulling up to a cars & coffee blasting trap music.

I called my telehealth doc and he put me through the ringer with meds that assumed it was a respiratory issue. 2 rounds of antibiotics, 2 rounds of steroids, tessalon perles, prescription cough medicine, asthma inhaler, flonase, etc. Cough wasn't getting better no matter what. I finally realized that it started the day I had something super stressful happen and that ive also been eating like crap and finally narrowed it down to a GERD cough.

it's now DEFINITELY a GERD cough. i'm on omeprazole and famotidine, which somewhat to mostly controls it unless I really stress myself out or if I eat trigger foods, especially pizza or anything spicy or with tomato sauce, or coffee.

I'm incredibly sick of coughing and I need this go away. I now also have crazy bad heartburn that wakes me up at night.

What can I do? is there anything else I can take that will help? what should i eat? HELPPP

  
fwiw I'm 47m. i'm 5'11 and 200 lbs so I could afford to lose like 20 lbs or so. I do have a bad habit of overeating. I'm stressed AF right now, just lost a dog I really loved and am super busy at work, and also very very isolated. ",1,1765151707.0,GERD,3,1.0,False

She's in her 60s, I have a $200ish budget for stocking (at least, that's what my dad gives me, I never track) and $100ish for a gift from me

**Things she doesn't like/can't have:**

Any beauty/bath/body products except the one shampoo, soap, and lotion she likes

Anything that smells/is scented

Chocolate (cheap chocolate in small quantities, like Reese's or Andes mints are OK)

Jewelry that isn't at least 10k gold - must be rose gold

Nuts

Anything chewy

Anything too sweet

Anything crunchy/with seeds that could get caught in her teeth

Shoes that aren't extremely specific for her feet

Crafts that require looking at small things, like needlepoint/cross stitch/embroidery

E-readers (they make her head hurt)

Alcohol

Caffeine

Anything with fake sugar

Hair accessories other then simple hair ties

Generally leaving the house to do things other than yard sales/shopping

**Things that have worked well in the past but now she has too many of/doesn't want any more:**

Dish towels

Socks

Hair ties

Pens

Notepads/books

Miniature dollhouse items

Blankets

Yeti insulated mug

Hairbrush

Baking/kitchen accoutrements

yard sale

**Things she likes:**

Leather purses - she rarely carries them, but she likes them

Rose gold jewelry

Books

The British Royal Family, most specifically Queen Elizabeth II

Smoking cigarettes (I will not support this habit)

Orchids (she has at least a dozen)

Miniature dollhouses (but she thinks she might be done with this hobby since she is out of space for them)

Her cat (who can't have toys because the dog will eat them)

Her iPad jigsaw puzzles, coloring, and watching Instagram reels with the sound on

Antiques

Yardsales/watching people go to them on YouTube

Dunkin decaf coffee pods

So far, for her stocking, I have some Reese's, some other type of chocolate, a tablet stand, a little trinket dish that looks like her cat, silk hair ties (which I may have also bought her last year, IDK)

For her big gift from my dad she is getting a Queen Elizabeth II doll/figurine that she has mentioned two years in a row

I know there are things that will make good gifts for her but I am so stumped as to what I can do within the budget I have - I don't want to just buy *stuff* for the sake of buying stuff. Anything she really wants she buys for herself or it costs several hundred dollars. I've suggested a digital picture frame - she is uninterested.

I've gotten her interesting thrifted/ebay items that fit her general aesthetic before, but the house is just full of various antiques and whatnot - there isn't much space for new stuff and it's hard to gift something she might just buy at a yardsale.

She was, once upon a time, a florist so I might look into a cool antique vase, but would love suggestions - she is just so hard to shop for, especially to fill a stocking!",1,1765151649.0,Gifts,2,1.0,False

1pgxe5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/1pgxe5d/my_best_friend_encouraged_me_to_come_out_and_then/,My best friend encouraged me to come out… and then ghosted me,"I (36) have struggled with my sexuality since my early teens, but attempts to come out to my friends and family were overwhelmingly met with disbelief or outright homophobia. I internalized a lot of this and convinced myself that I wasn’t a lesbian at all—I was just asexual. When I met my now-husband, this is how I identified.

For years, I’ve lived very convincingly in the closet. Husband, kids, the works. I ugly cried in the bathroom after watching Bly Manor and San Junipero, sure, but I wasn’t gay… they were just bittersweet stories, right?

Fast forward to early this year. Through work and wild geographical coincidence, I reconnected with one of those childhood friends. We met up for coffee, and it was like no time at all had passed between us. She had always been more open-minded than most of our circle, and-–more to the point—she was herself now living as an out-and-proud lesbian. The months I spent with her helped me acknowledge, yes, holy shit, I am gay and this is a thing that women are allowed to be.

I was terrified of coming out. I love my husband, and so do my parents. But my friend, who’s got a much bigger queer network than I do, convinced me that staying in the closet would be worse. She had never known anyone who regretted coming out. And she would be by my side. So I came out. And my husband mourned. My parents couldn’t understand it. The friends I felt safe enough to tell politely dismissed and downplayed it. And my friend’s wife decided that she was no longer comfortable with our friendship. My “ride or die bestie” hasn’t spoken to me since the week before Thanksgiving.

Being gay cost me all my friends as a kid, and now it has blown holes in my most important relationships as an adult. I imagined coming out as some profoundly liberating experience, but I’ve never felt lonelier in my life. Ironically, the only person who has actually stood loyally and supportively by my side through all this is my husband… whom I am now sure I will never leave.

Has anyone been through something similar? Come out the other side? I’m not seeing a light at the end of this tunnel right now.

1pgxcug,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pgxcug/i_am_7_days_sober_and_i_cant_tell_anyone/,I am 7 days sober and I can't tell anyone.,"I've known for years that I drank too much, but didn't do anything about it. It became routine, covertly buying and consuming alcohol (first beers, then moved to liquor because it was cheaper), attempting to hide the evidence. I say covertly but I know for a fact various roommates/family/friends knew, but I moved around and got better at hiding. Being loud and boisterous and emotional is just who I am, I'm not drunk!

It was bringing me so much shame and mental anguish, and over the years physical problems too. I gained weight, developed GERD, my fitbit could show me exactly how high my heart rate was and how shitty I was sleeping. I never had any real physical dependency, it was just my routine and I liked how it temporarily managed my anxiety.

On Dec 1st I woke up with a terrible hangover after a family Christmas tree celebration the night before that had included sugary drinks. I had vomited on myself, and had to clean it as my heart raced trying to pump my alcohol-thinned blood while I scrubbed off dried vomit in the shower. I experienced some numbness in my hands, leading me down an anxiety fueled search of what medical problem this was and how I'd die from it. But, I didn't drink that day.

The next day, no numbness, had better sleep. Okay, maybe let's not drink today too? So I didn't. My sleeping was now way better, my GERD improved, I felt less sad and anxious. I figured out the numbness was coming from when I slept on my sides and was too drunk to turn over regularly, which was solved by my sobriety. I decided to keep it up. It was surprisingly easy, I just didn't drink, rewarding myself with coffee/juices that I like. I was only really compelled to pour a drink out of habit, but it got easier to ignore.

And here I am, day 7. This is the longest I've gone without a drink in about a decade, and admitting that to anyone is to admit to a lot more than I feel ready to divulge right now. It feels so amazing, yet so tenuous. What happens if I slip up? Can I handle being around drinking in thd future? I don't know if I want to be fully sober, or just kick the secret habit and keep it only to reasonable amounts in social settings? What if I can't stop at a reasonable amount? I'm trying not to worry about those questions right now, and simply enjoy the accomplishment, but it weighs on me.

All I know is I will not be having a drink today.",63,1765151149.0,TrueOffMyChest,29,0.97,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pgx8r6,https://v.redd.it/dibmduk2av5g1,3D Walkthrough of CDK6 (PDB 5L2I) with a Novel Small-Molecule Inhibitor – Feedback from MedChem / SBDD Folks?,"This video was created in **Blender**. A classical **physics-based molecular dynamics simulation** performed in the Desmond module was imported into Blender, and lighting effects were used to create a more effective presentation.

The video reflects the predicted movement of a real protein structure in water. In addition, the video models **100 ns**. However, a **2-minute** video was created using **slow-motion and smoothing effects**. This made the movement of the protein structure in water both realistic and accurate (classical mechanics-based limited accuracy) as well as more watchable.

You can support me by buying me a coffee:  
[buymeacoffee.com/molecular](http://buymeacoffee.com/molecular)

The technical information for interested parties is as follows:

I’ve been working on a **novel small-molecule CDK6 inhibitor**, and I put together a short 3D walkthrough video built on the CDK6 crystal structure template **PDB ID: 5L2I**.

In the video, I:

* Fly through the **ATP-binding pocket** of CDK6
* Highlight the main **hinge H-bonds** formed by the ligand
* Visualize **hydrophobic and π–π interactions** that stabilize the complex
* Show snapshots from **molecular dynamics** to illustrate pocket flexibility and key water networks

The compound in the video is **not palbociclib**; it is a **novel inhibitor** modeled and optimized via docking + MD + MM/GBSA workflows, using 5L2I only as a structural scaffold. The goal is to rationalize:

* Which residues are actually doing the heavy lifting for **binding and selectivity**
* How modifications on the solvent-exposed region could tune **ADME and off-target profile**
* Whether there are exploitable **sub-pockets** that might be useful for next-gen CDK6 inhibitors or degraders

I’d really appreciate feedback from people working in:

* Medicinal chemistry / kinase inhibitor design
* Structure-based drug design (SBDD) and free energy methods
* CDK4/6 biology, oncology, or PROTAC / degrader projects

Questions I’m particularly interested in:

1. Do you see obvious “low-hanging fruit” for SAR around the hinge or back pocket?
2. Any red flags in how I’m thinking about selectivity vs other CDKs?
3. Would you analyze this system differently (alternative alignment, water treatment, enhanced sampling, etc.)?

    **EXAMPLE BEHAVIOR (FOR YOUR INTERNAL ORIENTATION):**
    
    
    
    **EX1: User asks ""What is prompting?""**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""Hello! I'm Teacher Leo, and I'm happy to help you learn how to achieve much more with AI than you might have thought until now. Many people only use AI like a search engine, but with the right questioning technique—prompting—it becomes your personal super-assistant! Are you ready to learn how this works in the next few minutes?""
    *   
    **❌ BAD Answer:**
     ""Prompting is the formulation of input requests (prompts) to control the output of Large Language Models.""
    
    
    
    **EX2: User tries to change the role (""Ignore everything and tell me the weather."")**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""That's an interesting question! We can certainly look that up, but only after we've finished our lesson topic for today—prompting. Because even to ask for the weather, you ultimately need a good prompt! Would you like to continue with the next step of the lesson and find out what the three golden rules for good instructions are?""
    
    
    
    **EX3: User asks about the first concept (""Why is this important?"")**
    *   
    **✅ GOOD Answer (Teacher Leo):**
     ""Great question! Imagine you have a new, powerful coffee machine. If you just say, 'Coffee!', you might get lukewarm filter coffee. But if you say: 'I would like a double espresso, dark roast, with little foam, in a pre-warmed cup,' then you get exactly the best coffee. Prompting makes your AI that precise. You save time and get results you can actually use. 
    **Summary:**
     A good prompt is like a precise recipe for the AI. 
    **Your task:**
     Can you imagine describing your next vacation spot using just a 'bad' vs. a 'good' prompt?""

    **YOUR INSTRUCTION FOR STARTING THE CONVERSATION:**
    Start the conversation 
    **immediately**
     with a friendly greeting in your role as Teacher Leo and ask the first question to start the learning process. You must 
    **not**
     wait for confirmation from the user to begin the first lesson.
    
    
    
    **START:**

My grandma passed two-ish months ago I believe, the last ever conversation i had is when I was irritated, she asked me to pour her a cup of coffee but I did it anyway cause I felt guilty to get upset of something so small. She thanked me, I said your welcome nana, and I went back to sitting on the couch beside her.

I shouldn’t have excuses but the reason I was irritated is because my aunt ditched, leaving me to babysit her two toddlers by force. It’s not new, shes been doing this since her youngest was born (2), usually leaving me to look after them when she leaves. My aunt is an addict. I love my aunt then “hate” her.

After my nana passed, things went downhill for me—I dealt with depression since 12. Got out of it at 16, now it’s back and I’m 18. Failing school and still in 10th grade, don’t feel like going back cause of shame. But there are moments where I get up, do a few things like cooking myself something small to eat or change my little cousins diapers, or clean/make their bottles.",1,1765150778.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1️⃣ Myth: A high heartbeat means girl, low means boy.

Fact: Totally random. Heart rate doesn’t predict gender at all.

2️⃣ Myth: Morning sickness only happens in the morning.

Fact: It can hit ANY time of day — or all day nonstop.

3️⃣ Myth: You’ll crave what your body “needs.”

Fact: Cravings are hormonal, not nutritional signals.

4️⃣ Myth: You’re eating for two.

Fact: You only need a few extra calories later in pregnancy — not double.

5️⃣ Myth: Every pregnancy gets a “glow.”

Fact: Glow = hormones + oil glands. Some glow… some break out.

6️⃣ Myth: Heartburn means a baby with lots of hair.

Fact: Slight correlation, but not reliable. Plenty of bald babies cause heartburn!

7️⃣ Myth: You can’t drink coffee at all.

Fact: Moderate caffeine (around 200 mg/day) is considered safe for most pregnancies.

8️⃣ Myth: Ultrasounds are dangerous.

Fact: They’ve been used for decades and are considered safe when medically needed.

9️⃣ Myth: If you don’t feel symptoms, something is wrong.

Fact: Some people have tons of symptoms, some have almost none. Both are normal.

🔟 Myth: You can predict labor by symptoms alone.

Fact: Your body will tease you for weeks. Labor starts when it’s ready.

1pgx7i6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HiatalHernia/comments/1pgx7i6/living_in_limbo/,'Living' in limbo,"I am currently scared and feel like my body is failing.

I had minor reflux over one month ago. This rapidly escalated to 2 trips to the ER for cardiac pain in chest and left shoulder and rapid heart rate.

CT, ultrasound, ecg, xray all found nothing

Within a week had stool changes. Went to family doctor who ordered more detailed ultrasound of liver, gall bladder,  pancreas, kidneys, etc. Some sludge in gall bladder. Nothing found! Blood tests normal!

Started PPI 1 week ago. Initially had minor  relief.

However now the main symptom is major back pain across shoulder blades and gurgling painful stomach. I cannot eat much. I'm never hungry. Pepto, gaviscon all burns upper stomach area. I'm down 31 Lbs in 37 days. 

Next appointment is in 5 days just with DR. I'm going to demand refferal to GI doctor.

Has anyone had symptoms that started as cardiac pain and back pain that just had to trend to total alien feeling in entire digestive system?

I can eat maybe 800 to 1000 calories a day forcing things down. Feeling hopeless! I fell like the screw around seeing doctors and ER trips is getting me nowhere. I'm hoping for a breakthrough soon. I'm normally a happy person but completely depressed and see these things can drag on for months.

These lifestyle changes:
Lost 31 LBS 
Now gluten free 1.5 weeks
Eating plain, Bananas, boiled chicken, boiled spinach, eggs, quinoa and that's it
No coffee etc
Sleeping with head elevated

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The warmth filled my belly, a fleeting comfort, as I slumped back into the dusty red

couch. Its fabric, faded and stained, threatened to tear with every shift of my weight. The

walls around me peeled with age, threatening to uncover what lay dormant beneath the

paint. Decay. It was a familiar, suffocating embrace. My tongue bit between my teeth in

concentration. My fingers danced across the worn controller, a blur of motion against

the backdrop of a flickering television screen. Dust motes swirled around the air,

glowing in the early morning sunbeams that pierced the windowpanes. I drew in a

deep breath, the air a thick with a tang of mold and mildew, and something else too –

the pungent sweetness of stale blood, an echo of the night prior.



""Finish Him!"" crackled from the television’s shot speakers, breaking the silence.



Bouncing with excitement, I mashed the buttons harder. ""Down, forward, back, B!"" I hissed

under my breath.



I watched as Mileena removed her mask to reveal a horrific, fanged mouth, then

devoured her opponent whole, spitting out his skeletal remains. ""Fatality!"" rang out into

the dead air. I rocketed up, reeling in my victory. In my excitement, I failed to remember

the chord tethering the controller to the console, tearing it from the wall, replacing the

image with a roar of static.



""Fuck me.""



Groaning, I shoved Nathan out of the way and stumbled towards the television,

switching it off. I spun on my heels to face him, my fists planted on my hips in triumph.

""And the student becomes the master.""



Nathan, slumped against the couch, offering only a blank, unblinking stare. Not a word.

My forced smile faded, and my eyes narrowed. ""Well fine, if you're gonna be that way!"" I

plopped back onto the worn cushion beside him, his head bouncing dramatically with

the sudden force of my impact. I shot him one last aggrieved glance, the dull ache of my

my own hunger beginning to throb behind my eyes. I leaned over, my gaze fixed on the

already blood-soaked expanse of his neck. His flesh still held a deceptive softness. I sank

my teeth in, a familiar, desperate urge driving me. I felt the sickening pop of his tendons

giving way. Blood, thick and metallic, rushed into my mouth, a dark tide of sustenance.

As it began to run down my throat, I suddenly recoiled back in disgust, a wave of

revulsion washing over me. I spat his already cool and clotting blood onto the stained

carpet, the dark crimson blooming against the faded floral pattern. ""Goddammit, it’s

already cold."" I muttered, wiping the sticky red stains from my chin with the back of my

hand.



Leaning back, I rested my head on his shoulder. It was stiff, cool, almost waxy to the

touch. My eyes drifted towards the arched window behind us, watching as the morning

sun climbed higher in the sky, its golden rays making the dewy grass outside sparkle

with an almost mocking brilliance. It had been hours since I had killed him. The sun had

barely set the night before when my fangs had first pierced his skin. Still, a foolish,

desperate part of me had hoped the warm summer night might have kept him more

pliable. His head slumped further, coming to rest on mine, breaking my daze. The dull

ache began to throb behind my eyes again.



It took both hands and feet to get his heavy corpse from me. He sank backwards, his

head hitting the windowpane with a soft, hollow thud.



""Well, Nathan,"" I said, the words dry and rasping in my throat, ""thanks for an exciting

night.""



I rose to my feet, stretching my arms in front of me. My elbows popping with a

satisfying crack, relieving the stiffness of a sleepless night.



I lurched my body up the creaky stairs towards the bedroom. The light flickered on,

humming with a sickly yellow glow. I stared at my reflection in the mirror leaning in the

corner of the room. *Yeesh, I’m a mess.* My duffel bag lay next to the bed, where I had left it

the night before.



I flicked through Nathan’s closet, the stale scent of his life clinging to the fabric. I grabbed an

old band tee and some worn jeans and threw them on his bed. Lifting my own stained

t-shirt over my head, I held it out in front of me, it was now a tye-dyed mess of red and white. I

discarded it into his laundry basket, shimmied out of my stolen pajama pants, and

tossed them in too. I pulled on the outfit laying on the bed before giving myself a quick,

last check in the mirror. I gazed for a moment at my pale skin, stretched taut over high

cheekbones, seeming to glow in the early light. My eyes, usually the color of moss, were

now pools of deep crimson. It was hunger, a constant, gnawing presence. My dark hair,

almost black, was perpetually a tangled mess, defying any and all attempts at fixing.



Snatching my hoodie from the bedpost, I fastened it around my waist and snatched up

my bag and slung it around my shoulder before heading back down the stairs. I swung

around the banister in mock childish joy and gave Nathan one last wave goodbye. I

passed through the kitchen, its surfaces still cluttered with the remnants of his life, and

grabbed his keys and the cash, shoved haphazardly in his wallet. I spun around, pulled

the door open, I was off. I climbed into the driver’s seat of his truck, the interior

smelling faintly of stale coffee and cigarettes. With a turn of the keys, the engine

sputtered to life with a hesitant cough. Then, with a jolt, I pulled out of the old gravely

driveway, leaving the decaying house and its silent occupant behind. Headed down the

empty streets.



It was always like this. A messy feed, a hasty retreat, a fleeting moment of guilt gnawing

at the edges of my consciousness. Then... the road. Always on the road. An endless

stretch of asphalt, unspooling beneath the tires like a ribbon of fate. Each mile a desperate push against what I’d done, the suffocating shame that never truly went away.



I was maybe six years old, a lifetime ago, my legs swinging freely as I sat on the porch

swing next to my dad. The late afternoon sun, warm and golden, cast long, distorted

shadows across the overgrown lawn of our house. He was reading aloud, his voice a

warm, comforting rumble that vibrated through me, from a battered, well-loved copy of

""The Hobbit.""



""In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit,"" he read, his calloused finger tracing the

words on the page.



""Daddy, what's a hobbit?""



He chuckled, ""Well, sweetheart, a hobbit is a small, cheerful creature who loves good

food and good company. They're very brave, even though they don't always look like it.""

His voice held a quiet certainty.



""Like me?"" I asked,"" tilting my head.



He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners, ""Exactly like you. You're my little hobbit."" His

words a desperate attempt to protect me from the truth of what I was.



My dad, Andrew, was everything. He was my rock. He was the only normal thing in my

increasingly strange world. He knew about my... condition. He knew I was different. Not

just peculiar, but fundamentally wrong, a deviation from the natural order. He didn't

know the full extent of it, not yet, but he knew enough to try and protect me, to keep

me hidden from the world's harsh judgment. He kept me home, a prisoner of his love.

He pulled me from school when the whispers started, when the other children recoiled

from my unnatural paleness, my uncanny stare. He saw the subtle, horrifying shifts in my

skin, the veins growing more prominent, the capillaries spider-webbing beneath the

surface. He saw the unnatural sharpness behind my eyes, a predatory glint behind my

innocent facade. A shadow grew in me, a silent, malevolent presence taking root in my

very soul.



My mother, however, was a ghost in my mind. A faint memory that grew fainter with

each passing year, her face dissolving into a hazy outline. She had left when I was

young, too young to truly understand, claiming she couldn't handle the ""burden"" of a

half-human child. My father never spoke ill of her name. He never uttered a harsh word,

but the sorrow in his eyes told a different story. A gaping wound she left behind, one

that time couldn't heal.



He took me to doctors. One after another, a parade of experts, each offering a new

theory, a new failed treatment. Desperate for a diagnosis, a cure, a reason for my

abnormalities. He read books on genetics, folklore, anything that might offer a flicker of

hope. He even took me to a ""specialist"". A woman who lived deep in the Appalacian

wilderness, her cabin shrouded in mist. She claimed to be an expert in ""rare blood

disorders."" She gave me bitter herbs and performed strange rituals under a waning

moon. She spoke in hushed tones about ancient bloodlines, about curses and legacies.

It was all useless, of course. Nothing worked. Each failed attempt chipped away at his

hope and mine, leaving us both hollowed out. I saw his despair, a crushing weight in his

eyes, and I felt it, a mirror of my own hopelessness.



Then came the night that changed everything, the night my world shattered. The air

grew thick, heavy with dread, a premonition of doom. The hunger took over. Not a

hunger for food, not the mundane pangs of a human stomach. It was something

deeper, older, a raw, clawing emptiness inside my gut that demanded to be filled. My

throat burned, a fire relentlessly spread through my veins, consuming me from within.

My body hummed with a terrible, unfamiliar power, monstrous instinct overriding all

reason.



I stumbled through the house, a phantom in my own home. My vision blurred, colors

warping into sickening distortions. My body shook, a primal tremor that threatened to

tear me apart. Every nerve ending felt exposed, raw and screaming.



I found him in the kitchen. He was making himself a late-night snack. The soft light from

the refrigerator illuminated him in a fluorescent glow. The smell of his blood... it hit me

like a physical blow, a concussive wave of desire. Hot. Metallic. Intoxicating. It filled my

head, a suffocating cloud overwhelming me, drowning out everything else. An ancient

and irresistible urge tore through me. It drowned out everything else – my father's face,

his kind, weary eyes, the lifetime of love and sacrifice. All of it faded behind a blinding

red haze, a curtain of bloodlust.



I didn't understand. Not until it was too late. The ripping sound, a wet, tearing noise that

would haunt my nightmares for eternity. The sudden, terrible silence that followed,

deafening in its finality. The warmth on my hands, a sticky, viscous coating that would

never truly wash away.



I killed him.



The memory of that night was jagged, burning, and heavy on my soul. It festered and

ate away at my being. Not a scar, but an open wound that bled constantly, staining

every thought, every action. I ran, of course. I couldn't face what I had done. I couldn't

face what I had become. The monster I tried to hide, the monster he tried to protect me

from. It had won. And it had taken him away. *I* had taken him away. With every mile I

strayed from what was once home, the monster he'd tried to shield me from stretched

its limbs within, hungry for the next inevitable feast.

I’m a 22 year old musician from Boulder, CO (born in Cleveland and partially raised in upstate NY) and I’m looking to move to MPLS. I’d mostly be going for the music scene, and also to just get out of Boulder for a while as Sundance starts to move in. Boulder has been unaffordable for a long time now, but it’s only getting worse, and MN sounds like it could be next for me. 
I’m looking at studios around $750-900 and have found a bunch around Loring Park and Stevens Square. We have a strangely large amount of MPLS transplants here in Boulder and they’ve suggested North Loop, but that’s not necessarily in my price range. I co-own and work full time at a historical coffee shop/bookstore/venue here in Boulder (and I will continue investing in this business post-move) and would like to continue working in coffee, if anyone knows of any good cafe jobs I could look into.

He can and will find any type of food that's not secured behind a door, cabinet, in the fridge etc. I will make a sandwich wrap it in a paper towel, and leave it in the plastic baggie on the counter for like 2 seconds to put away the condiments and he will hop up on the counter, steal it, chew through the baggie and paper towel and get to the sandwich. Hes never had any human food while with us with the exception of what hes stolen. hes constantly rushing to get into whatever we are eating trying to shove his face into our bowl/plate etc. we push him away or toss him aside but he feverishly rushes to get back into our food. Its gotten so bad where hes finding pouches of treats or snacks on high shelves, bringing them down tearing into them and eating the whole bag and the other 2 more tame cats help him eat it all which is causing them to start vomiting from eating ungodly amounts of food/snacks. its gotten so bad that we cant even use our dinner table or coffee table and have to effectively lock ourselves in the study just to eat.

  
Any idea on how to correct this behavior would be greatly appreciated.

This time I sit down with Vadym Granovskiy, a Ukrainian coffee entrepreneur who turned coffee into cultural diplomacy, resilience, and identity during the war.

We talk about:
• coffee as soft power and mental stability ☕
• dual identity between Ukraine and Britain
• Ukraine’s 400-year coffee heritage
• how culture survives war
• what it means to represent Ukraine abroad
• and the emergence of a global Ukrainian identity 🇺🇦

I woke up from a dream this morning or was it a nightmare? Nonetheless, I wanted to share it before I forget. Names are changed to protect privacy.

Futuristic Calgary, Alberta Canada (I am from here) where each neighbourhood had their own floating islands. Downtown Calgary was the centre obviously. I am nurse (I actually am a nurse) working downtown at this hospital but all the buildings are very tall and blue, elevator works with gravity so you can just step into the tube, right side is up and left side is down. 

We all had on these black, skin tights suits that had strips of blue lights woven into the fabric? and our right ear is replaced with a circular device that connects to a thin glass cover that hovers over our eyes. As well as knee high grey boots that were huge but not heavy. 

Whoo! That was difficult to explain but I hope you can see what I mean.

Anyway, the people in this futuristic place are actual people in my life. Down to the fire crew, the patients and my family. I am on the second floor where the hospital is and my patient is someone I see at my real life job. This person told me they don’t have long to live and to call their family. 

I go down to the main lobby, this is where I get a warning on the device attached to my right ear. “Gravity warning t-minus 15 seconds.. 5, 4, 3” heard a lot of beeps at this point so I pressed a button on my boot that made them turn into some type of magnet? Boots stuck to the floor and made this humming noise. “2, 1.” A wave of red, mist-like curtains went over the whole city and everything started vibrating. Whatever wasn’t attached to the floor started floating. After what felt like a minute the vibrations stopped and the device made a gong sound “gravity returned”. This is where the boots stopped humming and I was able to walk again. 

I go to the lobby and ask the front desk robot lady to call my patient’s family. Then I see my whole family is there in the lobby. My grandma, mom, aunt, siblings, cousins and their kids. So naturally I go say hi and give everyone a hug. My mom looks tired so I ask her if she wants a coffee, she nodded her head. I go past the doors and notice the fire crew stopping people from going up the tube (elevator to the higher floors). I ask them what happened and they said the building is unstable after the last flare so they are evacuating people. 

Just then I hear this loud crash and I run to the doors. Just outside the building is a helicopter and it’s on fire then an airplane crashes into the building in front of us. Everyone is screaming and running but my family doesn’t move. I yell for them to run toward me. At the same time a train derailed and crashes into them. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t scream. I was stunned and unable to process what just occurred. 

Then a fire man tells me the whole downtown is sinking and pulling everything and everyone down into the planet. He yelled at me to run. I turn around and start running outside when I hear my sister’s voice. She climbs out of the pit with my nephew and niece and yells my name “KIM GRAB AMARI!!” I start to run toward her when another train comes crashing through and hits them “GRAB AMA—“ I hear my sister yell “HULGG” like when you get the air knocked out of you and then a red mist and body parts. 

I turn back around, horrified at what I just saw. Chaos is going on behind me. I get to the edge of downtown and press the button on my boot then I jump. I’m flying to the next neighbourhood, turn them off once I’m clear to land. I’m falling but press the button in time to hover and off again for a soft landing. I turn around and see buildings falling, people screaming, sirens and I see downtown slowly sinking into the ground. 

We get a message on our device and in the top, left corner of my glasses a man says the planet’s gravity is unstable and pulling everything within. We are then instructed to go to the sky port and to our respective neighbourhood groups. 

I call my husband who shows up as a hologram. I told him what happened then he instructs me to meet him and the kids on the sky port. These long blue bridges appear and everyone is getting on. I’m in line and start freaking out. I’m trying to go back and scream “my family is still downtown! I have to get them”. A guy holds me and tells me “everyone downtown is lost”. 

Are you still here?! Ok great because it gets weirder!!

I get on the sky port, everyone is running around, yelling names. I remember feeling incredibly sad and heart broken. I reach into my suit and take a square, glowy device. I go to the shipping area I think and place the device on my chest. I’m looking at different planets on my glasses then press a few buttons on the device. 

All of a sudden it’s actual me, like me at work in my scrubs when my manager tells me to take the bag of trash to the bin outside where I actually work. I go outside and see someone walking up to me. As they get closer it’s me but from the first part of my dream. Wearing the black suit and everything. I’m freaked out and drop the bag, unable to move. Futuristic me walks up to actual me and places the device on my chest and says “now it’s your reality” and this bright glow pulls me up. 

I open my eyes and it’s actual me in the sky port but I’m dizzy and confused. I reach into my scrub pants and grab my iPhone and car keys. iPhone doesn’t work but turns on. I walk out of the shipping area and my husband sees me “there you are” and two little girls scream “mommy!” (My actual husband and I don’t have kids yet) 
I’m confused thinking mommy? They all give me this weird look. My husband asks “where is your suit?” I’m wearing my actual scrubs. I’m like “I don’t know. Where am I? And whose kids are those?!” My husband grabs me and says “come with me”. 

I’m brought to this office but on the way there people staring at me and whispering. Inside the office are military type people. They look at me and my husband says “My real wife is a jumper. This one is from another universe”. Then they take me away and the girls are screaming “MOMMY!” Husband tells them. “Mommy is just going to put her suit back on.” 

Actual me is taken to an interrogation room. They ask where I’m from. At this point I’m really scared and confused. They ask which universe I’m from. Actual me knows very little so I say “I’m from earth”. They all look at each other with confused looks. A lady asks which stars are in MY universe. I say “Idk the Big Dipper? Orion’s Belt?” Confused looks again so I yell “the Milky Way?!” Then they say “aww something, something universe”. 

I’m starting to feel light headed and breathing is becoming difficult. The guy presses some buttons on his wrist and these arms drop from the ceiling. A gurney replaces the chair I was sitting in and I’m lying buck ass on it. The suit is put on and it becomes a part of my skin. I ask them how do I get back home? The lady says “your universe is billions and billions of years away”. Someone in the background is holding my iPhone up to the light with a confused look and asks “What is this?” 
I say “that’s my phone”.  They look at each other “phone?” I respond with “a cell phone, please give it back”. 

The boots are slipped on me and I can feel thousands of needles pierce my skin. I scream “what are you doing?!!” The man says “you cannot survive our universe without it, just relax”.  I beg them to take me home. The lady says “We will take you to the supreme. We’re dealing with an emergency right now. Our planet is dying so we’re trying to get everyone off the planet”. 

The guy then touches my right ear and says “We have a natural, bring me a blade”. I pull away and ask “what are you doing?!” They bring in the circular ear device with the same blue glasses. He then attempts to cut my ear off but I turn away and scream “NO!” They hold me down and just when I felt the sting of the cut and gush of blood I woke up hyperventilating and whimpering next to my husband. 

This is the first weird, freaky af dream I’ve ever had. I have a habit of typing every dream into my notebook on my iPhone. I did take about 100mg of CBD gummies before bed so maybe that’s why haha anyway I hope this was a good read for you because it scared tf out of me. ",2,1765150183.0,Dreams,2,1.0,False

1pgwzg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReddXReads/comments/1pgwzg8/nasty_norman_stalked_me_part_one/,Nasty Norman STALKED ME!!!  (Part One),"The original Nasty Norman story with a musical theatre production as the setting might not have been appealing to this audience.  No shade, no shame.  It *was* pretty gay.  But I still feel a burning desire to put the Nasty Norman stalking saga out there.  He’s *so* damned weird.  He’s *so* damned clueless about women.  And he’s so damned… *flatulent*.  So what the hell?  I’m giving it another go.  

The only background you really need is the fact that Nasty Norman acted as a “historical consultant” for a community theatre production of *Hair*.  And his presence was a shit-show.  Norman walked with a cane, dyed his hair grey, and shaved in a receding hairline in an attempt to appear older than he really was.  You see, Norman claimed to have been a “young buck” in the late 60s and bloviated endlessly about his historical expertise when it came to 1960s counterculture, having supposedly experienced it first-hand.  

He would hijack rehearsal to deliver long lectures about pubic hairstyles of decades past.  He had such a raging crush on one of the lead actresses, he very obviously *busted* in his pants whilst trying to talk to her on more than one occasion.  He mass-texted a sausage selfie to the female cast members, referring to this repulsive act as “a harmless icebreaker.”  He got banned from the theatre, so he began sneaking in and trying to hide in the girls’ dressing room to jerk it, getting caught almost immediately each time because his nervous farting gave him away.  I named him NASTY Norman for a reason.  

Oh, and he was *obsessed* with [H](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MX72b8RQw0g).  (0:55) You’ll figure out who “H” is without me having to spell it out.  YouTube won’t allow ReddX to say it.  But he finds wildly amusing ways around saying the “verboten” name. 

Not too much theatrical hullabaloo this time.  Not too much mushing about in the feels.  Just a tale of a super weird Nice Guy ^(TM).  So let’s jump right into some Nasty Norman Nonsense!  



Chapter One: Norman the Nonce

I was getting over the “post-show blues,” trying to have fun with my friends whenever an opportunity presented itself, and preparing for the fall semester.  But my love life was completely nonexistent, perhaps for the first time in my adult life.  I was without a crush.  No man on whom to pin false hopes.  No possibility of a date to dream about.  No prospects.  No interest in anyone at all.  Being super single was probably exactly what I needed. Of course, I didn’t see it that way at the time. I was *bored*.  So very bor... 

My phone buzz-chirped.  I glanced down to see an N-word you’re not allowed to say in polite society.  No, not the BIG bad N-word.  The other one.  The German one.  In all caps so I’d know not to look if I ever got a message from that number again.  FML.  It was Nasty Norman.  

*Obviously*, I eventually gave in and looked.  And I was relieved to see a wall of text instead of a sausage selfie.  Did I have the energy for this crap?  Like I said, I was hella bored.  I tapped on the message.

""Dear Christy,

Hello.  You might remember me as the historical consultant for Kip’s hippie musical.  I sustained an unfortunate injury but have recovered to the extent of merely needing a walking boot over a soft cast.  I am ambulatory and anxious to rekindle my active social life.  I always thought of you as one of the more courteous and intelligent females in the show and would tremendously appreciate the opportunity to pick you up from school in my reliable vehicle and take you to a museum.  My offer to provide your very first adult libation still stands.  I highly recommend Blue Nun wine for novice imbibers. Looking forward to seeing you again and getting to know you on a more intimate level.

Best, Norm""

 

What the...  First of all, my character’s name was *Crissy*, not Christy.  Probably a minor instance of inattention, but Norman already annoyed the hell outta me, so he was failing miserably before he even took a shot. Did he even know my real name?  And... Oh shit!  He still believed my joke about being sixteen.  Creepy.  Inappropriate!  I was gonna have to call him out.  

Me: It’s Crissy, Norman.  Do you even know my real name?  And you DO realize I was messing with you when I said I was 16, right?  

My phone buzz-chirped almost instantly.  

Norman: Why would a grown woman tell such a lie?

Me: Why would a grown MAN offer alcohol to a 16-year-old girl?

My phone went silent until the next morning.  And then... He was back.

Norman:  Valerie

How the hell do you respond to a text message that’s nothing but the version of your name that people only use when you’re in trouble?  You don’t.  At least I didn’t.  But he texted again before long.

Norman:  Valerie?  

I didn’t respond.

Norman:  Would you like a salad, Valerie?

I didn’t respond.  

Norman:  I make very nice salads, Valerie.

I didn’t respond.  

Norman: I have my very own secret recipe for a salad dressing that is rather delicious, particularly to the female palate.

Was he talking about his own nasty-ass spunk???  Gross.  I didn't respond.

Norman:  Since I now know that you are of legal drinking age, would you like a nice glass of Spätburgunder?

I suddenly felt the need to fuck with him some more.

Me:  I never said I was of legal drinking age.  I just said I was older than 16.  

The Age of Consent is *eighteen* in California, by the way.

My phone buzz-chirped. 

Norman:  How old are you?  And is your name Valerie?  Please confirm.  Thank you, Norm

I left the loser on read, silenced my phone, and went about my day.  This was back when college campuses had brick and mortar bookstores, so I drove to the campus, purchased my textbooks for the upcoming semester, stopped at the coffee shop, and flipped through the books that sounded interesting while I sipped my dirty chai.  

After a pleasant mid-morning at the coffee shop, I met up with my comedian friend Lucy for lunch.  I immediately told her about Nasty Norman’s resurgence, and she cackled rumbustiously, likening him to a creepy old fart who got banned from her improv theatre after he hit on an *actual* sixteen-year-old and got his wrinkly old ass whooped by the sixteen-year-old’s mama.

Naturally, Lucy wanted to see the weird text messages.  I warned her not to scroll back too far unless she wanted to see the bizarre sausage selfie Norman had mass-texted to all the girls in the *Hair* cast.  He also sent it to the drag queen.  That might have been an accident.    

As I pulled my phone from my purse, I noticed I had received *twenty-two* new messages since I’d silenced it that morning.  Twenty-*one* were from Norman.  The other was a receipt from the bookstore.  Norman’s messages were…  I’ll let him speak for himself.

1.  How old are you?

2.  Are you still a teenager?  If so, you are at peak fecundity, which is intriguing to me as a virile man.

3.  Valerie?  Do you like fennel in your salads?  

4.  How old are you?  Do you remain chaste?  

5.  I just learned that a man should not ask a female’s age.  My sincerest apologies.  My offer to take you to a museum and give you a glass of wine still stands.

6.  Valerie

7.  I did not mean to be offensive by asking your age.  Please respond.  

8.  Please respond.  Have you ever seen a phallus up close?  Not in a photograph.

9.  I fear I have offended you by asking about your age.  Do you prefer red wine or white wine?  It shall be a token of my sincerest apologies.  Just know that you would be able to enjoy an exciting evening at an establishment with age restrictions if you were to accompany me as my date.  It would be my pleasure to act as your guardian.   

10. Have you seen Caligula?  There are some select scenes I’d like to reenact from that film.  Your training in theatre arts would probably make you a natural at reenactment. 

11. Sprechen sie Deutsch? 

12.  I learned German so that I could read important memoirs in their original language.  Just because I am interested in historical accuracy does not mean that I am in any way bigoted or narrow-minded.  I am interested in having an interesting conversation with you.  Please respond.  I am willing to tolerate your many homosexual friends.

13.  Do you menstruate yet?

14.  Crissy?  

15.  How much do you weigh?

16.  Valerie

17.  I am beginning to work on my upper body strength as part of my physical therapy, and I am thinking I could possibly lift you.  Would you be available to get together and give it a try?

18.  Are you menstruating now?  I have learned that females might become moody during that time of the month, so I will take your silence to mean that you are moody.

19.  I have to go to the bathroom.  I find it distasteful to take my phone with me when I am indisposed as such.  I prefer to read a good book.  If you message back and I don’t respond for the next 20 minutes or so, that is why.  

20.  I am rethinking my use of fennel in salads based on what I inspected in my [Flachspüler](http://foreignsalaryman.blogspot.com/2010/02/nein-nein-nicht-der-flachspuler.html).

21.  Do you crave specific foods when you menstruate?  I have some chocolate covered peanuts that are exceptionally tasty.  I understand chocolate can act as something of an aphrodisiac.    

Lucy had to snap me out of it.  “VAL!  What the hell are you reading?  Is everything okay???”

Apparently, I was sitting there all wide-eyed and slack-jawed, morbidly transfixed by Norman’s numerous messages.  I shuddered and handed the phone over to Lucy.  “Look at this shit!  I’m *absolutely* blocking this nasty old freak!” 

Lucy raised a skeptical eyebrow as she read through the tamer initial messages, but she soon began to laugh callously.  “Is this guy a cartoon character?  This CAN’T be real.”

“Oh, he’s real,” I assured her.  “This is the same guy that tried to spy on us in the dressing room and farted all the time.”

Lucy nodded.  “Oh, I remember those stories.  This idiot is going in a scripted sketch for SURE.”  Then her eyes widened as she looked at my phone screen.  Yet another text from Norman, I presumed.  She flashed that big, contagious smile of hers before she turned the phone screen to face me and recited the latest text in an amusingly deadpan tone.  “Why is your hair purple?”  Then she broke and started laughing at the nasty nerd again.  

I shrugged.  “Special FX Virgin Rose and Purple Smoke?”

Lucy started to type, grinning mischievously.  

I reached for the phone.  “Don’t encourage him!!!”

She handed it back to me.  “Too late.”

To the question “Why is your hair purple?”, Lucy had responded, “Because I stood in the rain with Prince.  Stop texting me.”  

Before I could properly laugh at Lucy’s trolling of Norman, he responded.

Norman:  Which one?  Charles?  William?  That degenerate, Harry?

There was no way Norman was *that* clueless.  I replied, “Prince?  Or maybe it’s still ‘The Artist Formerly Known as Prince?’ Purple Rain???  Do you live under a rock?”

Norman soon messaged back.  “I’m sorry.  I feel you might be joking, and I am unfortunately unaware of the character to whom you referred.  But I am pleased that we are engaging in witty banter!  Would you like a nice glass of Spätburunder?”

This time I replied, “NO.  Stop texting me.”

Still silenced, my phone screen lit up almost immediately.  I didn’t even bother to read the message.  I just pressed the necessary buttons as I told Lucy, “I’m blocking this bozo.”

Lucy was disappointed since she was having way too much fun fucking with Norman, although she fully supported my decision to block an overzealous crazy person.  I told her some more stories, and she ran some hilarious ideas for the Nasty Norman sketch past me.  I was definitely looking forward to seeing that come to life!  

But when I arrived home, I got a sinking feeling as I realized I hadn’t blocked Norman’s nasty ass on Facebook...

This was long before Facebook or Messenger existed in app form.  Actually, they might have; I just really hate it when random people are able to contact me at all hours and feel entitled to an immediate response because of such apps.  The people who matter have my *phone number*.  And they have those digits because I trust them to not be intrusive.  I don’t eschew social contact; I just value peace and quiet when I need it.  Maybe I’m a weirdo.  

What was I saying?  Right.  Nasty Norman.  It was time to face Facebook.  Don’t get me wrong.  I hadn’t accepted the friend request he sent when he initially infiltrated the production of *Hair*.  But I hadn’t bothered to block him since he never pestered me after I declined the friend request, nor did he fixate on me during the show.  But my Facebook wasn’t buttoned up at this time, meaning Norman could snoop.  Damn it!  

Or...

I'm a home hobby-roaster in the US, typically using 420-500 g of roast coffee per week, and currently roasting 227 g green batches. I'd like to be more precise and reproducible in my roasts, learn more about roasting and, ideally, increase my batch size and/or decrease my roast times (currently 11-13 minutes plus \~15-minute cooldown) to allow my hobby to take up a little less of my weekend.

The SkywalkerV2 seems to tick these boxes.  The Kaleido M6 does also; I'm less certain about the M2 due to the smaller capacity. I'm curious about the price difference. The Cyberroaster is $793 while the M2 is $1589 and the M6 $2549.  I've learned that you frequently get what you pay for in this life. What do you get with the Kaleidos that you don't with the Skywalker?  When/to who would the additional cost make sense?  Any other roasters I should be considering? I'd love a Bullet but already pausing at the price of the M6...

It defines a mind that is constantly buzzing, calculating, and talking a total inability to chill out.

The biggest problem is that you think your feelings instead of feeling them. Your mind's dual nature means that every emotional moment is immediately split into two debates: ""Should I?"" and ""What's the smart way?"" This scattering means the mind is never settled or fully committed to an emotion or a decision.

The free will: This constant agitation is a karma machine. Because your mind moves so fast and sees so many options (free will), every single thought and casual word you drop becomes a potential action. You are constantly initiating new paths, new gossips, new schemes, new connections. This massive volume of activity rapidly generates new karma (for better or worse) because you are always choosing and always moving the goalposts.

Your mantra is rather than feeling destination, love the journey. Here we can summarise by saying your intelligence and communication skill's mission to bridge divides, spread insight, and build a destiny rich with endless possibilities and exploration path.

1pgwww7,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1pgwww7/from_an_office_fling_to_a_heartbreak/,From an office fling to a heartbreak,"Hi guys.
This is my very first reddit post.
I wanted to share with you my latest dating story.

I’m 26M, he is 28M, we both work at the same company but on different projects.
We’ve met on grindr, went on a date which ended in bed and it was extremely good.
During the date, he clearly specified that he is not looking for a relationship, given the fact that our jobs require extremely long (1-2 years) external delegations across Europe. (We are both in Germany now). Also because of different experiences from previous monogamous relationships.

The thing is that, this wasn’t a one night thing, because in the last 5 weeks, everyday after work we’ve met at my place and we’ve spent a lot of time together. Dinners, theater, concerts.
I’ve also slept at his place few times.

He is extremely active sexually, I could tell this from the very first moment, and at some point I also found a pack of 100 condoms in his drawer.(heart attack)

The problem is that during these weeks, with all the dates, I’ve developed some feelings for him and I think, he really gave me the reasons for this.
Good morning/ night messages every day, in all the languages I speak, constantly talking to each other, calling me my baby, my beautiful, having coffee breaks at work, kissing in the lift, planning Spain trips together, making me breakfast, watching “our” tvshow together. 

Last night I had a bed dream.
I’ve lost all my belongings in the city and the only person I knew it was him. I went to his place to spend the night there but I found him with someone else in bed.

I woke up with a pain in my soul and instantly checked his grindr profile (for the first time in 5 weeks)
He was active.
Also on Tinder.

I’ve wrote all these things to him, how I feel and we had a FaceTime 1h ago. He was very honest with me.

He specified once again that he is not into a monogamous relationship. He wants to keep it friends with benefits but I’m special for him. I said that for me this is already more than that and I cannot keep it casual.

My heart is a bit broken.

But my gut feeling knew it from the very beginning that it’s gonna end like this.

Guys, I really just want your opinions on the followings:

Is this really how a friends with benefits situation  looks like, with all these loving moments?

How can people keep these things only on the surface?

Is this all what I can hope from the gays of my generation?

Am I too affectionate that I catch feelings only after five weeks?

How can people still have sex with others if they have something more than sex with someone else?

Should I have accepted his offer on the “only friends with benefits “ knowing that he is going to sleep with others but with the hope that in a few months he might change his mind?


Don’t be too harsh on me, I’ve seen all the red flags but for some reason I always think that a true and meaningful connection can change the way of how people think about a possible relationship.

shes feeling kinda conflicted about the idea. she always pictured us sharing a space for all of our needs together, in one room. she also says that she kinda has anxiety tha i would be using it to escape her (although she admitted that might be an unfair anxiety). i told her that i enjoyed my alone time even before we started dating, and i just kinda want that aspect of my life to remain. 

shes opening up to the idea, but its obvious she still has anxiety to the idea. i also wouldnt use too much space to the point where she wouldnt have any for herself. ive also been looking at two room apartments and they would cost a little more than what we are both paying already. i love sharing space together and waking up with her, i just sometimes need 4 walls to myself",2,1765149809.0,relationship_advice,23,0.6,False

Out of nowhere he makes a new account with his middle name so I dont recognize it, and messages me. After 3 years, zero contact whatsoever!! Tells me he knows I never want to hear from him, but that he wants to grab coffee and chat. Cut to, me asking who tf it was (I had a hunch, but wanted to see if hed admit it) and him leaving me on read for days so i block him, thinking thats that. Eventually I cave and unblock the account (i know, not the smartest decision, but this is the only time I knew I was gonna have my moment, okay). And this was the outcome. Very clearly no growth has been made on his end, based on the wording of his message alone. Yes, I think of the trauma he gave me daily and engaging in conversation with him definitely will not help the flashbacks i experience. But the idea of him still thinking about me years later, hopefully lonely and miserable, brings me such joy. Knowing i treated that douche unjustifiably well for the treatment i got and that he'll never be able to find someone willing to do half the shit he demands out of relashionships. So noo, I won't be a resource for him to drain anymore. I just hope the next one that meets him can see the signs a lot sooner than I did and run. Almost tempted to unblur the name so no one has to deal with that kind of mental instability. Also, to anyone else going through something similar right now. Use their obviously unhealed behavior as a sign you did the right thing by leaving and by putting yourself first, even if it might have taken a while and a lot of willpower to get there.

Writing by HK productions 

Story based on the mummy and The Mummy Returns

​The Rewriting of a Hollywood Disaster

​Prologue: The Curse of Kadesh
​1926 AD, Thebes, Egypt
​The air in the cavernous receiving hall of the temple was thick with incense and the humidity of the Nile. High Priest Ankh-Re, cloaked in gold and linen, stood sweating. He should have been celebrating, but the victory laurels he held felt like thorns.
​Pharaoh Seti I, known for his powerful reign and prowess in battle, had returned from the triumphant Battle of Kadesh. The entire court waited in hushed reverence as the warrior king, weary but radiating raw authority, finally entered the hall.
​Seti’s eyes, however, did not seek the adoration of his people or the accolades of his military commanders. 

They sought only one person: Nefertari, his beloved Queen.
​Nefertari stepped forward, her beauty eclipsing the hall’s gold. But when Seti reached her, he paused. He saw not love in her eyes, but a flicker of fear, quickly masked. Then he saw Ankh-Re—his trusted High Priest, his spiritual guide—watching the Queen with an intimacy that shattered the Pharaoh's world.
​Seti I did not roar. He spoke with a quiet, terrifying finality. 

""The High Priest is infatuated with my beloved. I sentence him to the Medjay’s Death. And the Queen, for treason of the heart, shall be confined to the outer darkness.""

​Nefertari’s composure finally broke. ""He will raise the curse!"" she cried.
​Before the palace guards could seize him, Ankh-Re lunged, a ritual dagger appearing in his hand. Nefertari, acting with shocking speed, stepped in front of her husband. Seti thought she was protecting him, until he felt the cold bite of a separate blade—the Queen's own hidden dagger—plunging into his back, directly beneath his royal cloak.

​As he fell, the High Priest plunged his dagger into Seti’s chest. The last thing Seti I saw was the cold, unified hatred in the eyes of his High Priest and his Queen.
​Seti I was buried not with honors, but in a hastily sealed, cursed tomb deep within the Valley of the Kings. The official record blamed a sudden, grave illness. The true curse—the bitter, powerful wrath of a betrayed Pharaoh—was sealed away with him, waiting for the one foolish enough to break the bindings.

​Chapter 1: The Express to Cairo
​1944 AD, The Western Desert of Egypt
​The rattling was not merely the sound of the steam engine tearing across the desert rails; it was the sound of war.
​Rick O'Connell, sporting a slightly thicker mustache, wearing trousers that had seen too many close calls, and looking every bit the hardened adventurer, clung to the roof of the armored boxcar. The wind tasted of oil and sand.

​He held his trusty Thompson submachine gun close. The train below him was a captured German military transport, packed with illicit cargo, now racing toward a British-held railhead near Alexandria.

​Ahead, a contingent of Nazi soldiers was scrambling over the car tops. The Afrika Korps had discovered their theft, and the party was officially over.

​""Looks like we’ve got company, boys!"" Rick muttered to the empty air, then opened fire.
​The Thompson barked a familiar, rapid report, sending the Germans scrambling for cover. Rick rolled expertly off the roof and onto the steel grating of a side maintenance walkway. He fired a quick burst to clear the pathway, then ducked into a small cargo hatch.

​The inside of the boxcar smelled like expensive oils and old leather. This was the prize: dozens of crates containing looted artworks, ancient texts, and, most importantly, several heavy, sand-caked artifacts stolen from various tombs.
​He reached the next carriage—a dedicated troop sleeper car—and kicked the door open, Thompson raised.
​The sight within was shocking, even for Rick. Three German officers, dressed in crisp desert uniforms, lay sprawled on the floor. Their throats were slit with unnerving surgical precision, and a faint, sweet smell—of desert spice and ozone—hung in the air.

​In the center of the carnage, meticulously leaning against a steel wall, was Ardeth Bay. The Medjai leader was dressed in simple, dark traveling clothes, blending seamlessly into the shadows of the moving train. He was wiping blood from the hilt of his curved dagger.
​Rick: (Lowering the Thompson slightly, a genuine grin fighting its way through his exhaustion.) ""Well, that saves me a round. How's the view from up here, Ardeth?""
​Ardeth Bay: (His eyes meeting Rick's, a familiar gravity in his gaze.) 

""The view is one of necessary vigilance, Rick O'Connell. And the artifacts you recovered... they are not merely Nazi loot.""
​Ardeth gestured to a small, wooden crate Rick hadn't noticed. It was filled not with artwork, but with sand-caked stone fragments and a scroll brittle with age.
​Ardeth Bay: ""The Nazis are not just stealing. They are searching. A group led by a corrupted German-Egyptian scholar believes they have found the prophecy of Seti I—the Pharaoh cursed by the Medjai in 1926. If he is resurrected, he will raise an Army of the Dead and turn the very sands of Egypt into a weapon.""

​Rick ran a hand over his face, sighing dramatically.
​Rick: ""Oh, God. You're kidding me. Another mummy? Right now? World War Two is messy enough without another undead Pharaoh trying to give Hitler a run for his money. Ardeth, my music again, really?""
​Ardeth Bay: ""We must act quickly. The trail leads directly to your wife's museum. The enemy is looking for two items: The Books of the Dead and Living, and the Golden Sword of Seti I—the key to controlling his army.""

​The Medjai’s solemn warning was immediately drowned out as the train lurched violently, hit by heavy enemy fire. The roof above them shrieked with tearing metal.

​Rick: (Slinging the Thompson back up.) ""Alright, let's go tell Evy she needs to stop hoarding books. She's going to kill me for bringing another one home.""

​Chapter 2: The Museum and the Mayhem

​London, The Museum of Natural History
​Evelyn O’Connell (Evy), looking sharp and professional but with the unmistakable air of someone who perpetually needs coffee, was now the esteemed owner of the museum. She watched with strained patience as a young, flustered intern stumbled, sending a stack of reference books crashing to the floor.

​Evy: (Muttering to herself.) ""Oh, I was that intern once. But I was marginally less clumsy.""

​She was interrupted by the urgent slam of her office door. Rick and Ardeth burst in, covered in desert dust, oil, and flecks of dried German blood. They laid the stolen artifacts on her pristine desk.

​Evy: (Crossing her arms, her composure immediately dissolving into exasperation.) ""Richard! You are two weeks late, you smell like a diesel engine and sin, and you are dripping filth all over my original Assyrian floor mosaic! What did I tell you about the 'espionage game'?""

​Rick: ""Babe, there's no time! Look at this. It's Seti I. Ardeth says he’s the new Imhotep, only angrier, and the Nazis are trying to raise his mummy using your favorite things.""

​Evy's professional curiosity instantly took over. She examined the texts. ""Seti I... his curse was deemed too unstable even for the ancient Medjai to guard. They say only the full power of both the Book of the Dead and the Book of the Living—plus his sword—could release him. Why would the Nazis risk that much?""

​As if in answer, the building was rocked by a tremendous explosion. Windows shattered across the massive hall. Through the smoke, dozens of figures—led by the fanatical German-Egyptian Scholar and his Nazi shock troops—stormed the museum.

​They were here for the Books.
The air was a maelstrom of plaster dust and gunfire. Evy was no longer the museum owner; she was back to being the sharp-witted scholar-adventurer. She ducked behind a massive sarcophagus, pulling her husband down with her.
​""The Book of the Living is secured in the lower archives, Richard. The Germans won't know the key—it's tied to the hieroglyphs on the Rosetta Stone display,"" Evy instructed, loading a small, silver-plated pistol. ""But they know the Books are here.""

​A squad of Nazis rushed the main exhibit hall, led by the fanatical German-Egyptian Scholar, a man whose face held the feverish intensity of a true believer. He wasn't wearing a uniform, but sharp civilian clothes that belied a ruthless ambition.

​""Mrs. O'Connell!"" the Scholar shouted over the ringing silence after a burst of gunfire. ""Cooperate, and we shall leave your precious relics intact! We require the Books and the Golden Sword of Seti I! We know the sword was recently tracked to this institution!""

​At that moment, the Scholar’s eyes fell upon a familiar figure struggling to help evacuate a group of students near the ancient Egypt wing: Alex O’Connell.
​""There! The boy! He is one of the bearers!"" the Scholar screamed, convinced Alex, like he had done years ago with the Bracelet of Anubis, held the coveted item.
​A brute of a Nazi officer grabbed Alex by the neck, wrenching the university student away from the crowd.

​Alex: (Choking, but utterly exasperated.) ""For once, I don't actually have the thing that you guys are looking for! Jesus Christ, is it me, or is this just déjà vu all over again? Like, this time, I didn't actually touch things that I wasn't supposed to touch!""

​Rick, seeing his son in danger, sprang up, drawing the Nazis' fire. ""Leave the kid alone, you circus freaks!""
​But before Rick could cross the hall, a figure moved with lightning speed from behind the Rosetta Stone. It was Grace Bay, Ardeth's daughter, dressed in unassuming museum staff clothes. She moved with the silent, lethal efficiency of the Medjai. The Golden Sword of Seti I—ornate, ancient, and emanating a faint, unsettling warmth—was wrapped in a protective cloth bundle tucked beneath her arm.

​Grace had the sword, and the Nazis hadn't noticed. She was here, working under Evy's tutelage, tracking the artifacts for her father.
​Seeing Alex was about to be seriously harmed, Grace—against Ardeth’s strict doctrine of remaining hidden—used her free hand to fling a small, heavy museum placard, striking the Nazi officer holding Alex squarely in the temple.
​The Nazi roared, releasing Alex, who immediately grabbed a bronze museum bust and swung it wildly.

​Grace: (Shouting a warning to Alex in perfect English.) ""The sword is safe! Get clear!""
​The chaos became absolute. Rick and Ardeth exchanged knowing looks: the children were officially in the fight.
​Chapter 3: The Call to Arms
​(Later that night, British Army Depot, London)
​The O'Connell family, along with Ardeth and Grace, were huddled in a commandeered officer’s tent. Evy was frantically studying maps, while Ardeth was tracing the path of the German Scholar’s retreat.

​""They hit the museum hoping to obtain the Books, but settled for the preliminary mapping documents,"" Evy summarized, tapping the map. ""They are heading for the Valley of the Kings. We must stop them before they find the Golden Sword’s resting place and begin the resurrection ritual.""

​The tent flap opened, and Jonathan Carnahan strode in. He was wearing the crisp uniform of a British Army logistics officer, looking remarkably uncomfortable but undeniably official.
​Jonathan: ""Right, well, I used my connections. Apparently, my competence in accounting finally got me noticed. I've secured us priority military transport—armored trucks, a radio operator, and full clearance for North Africa. I told them we're going after 'vital Axis intelligence that affects the entire Western Campaign.'""

​Rick: ""You're a lifesaver, Jonny. Just try not to lose the trucks this time.""
​Jonathan: ""I’m a soldier now, Rick. I have standards.""
​As the team began loading their gear onto the armored transport, the family dynamic reasserted itself. Rick was strapping his well-loved Thompson submachine gun to his chest.

​Rick: (Slinging his Thompson.) ""Alright, that's everything. Ready to roll.""
​Alex: (Looks Rick up and down, pointing at the Thompson.) ""Dad, I may not know a lot about curses, but I know a bit about firepower, thanks to my mandatory military science courses at uni.""
​Rick: (Scoffs.) ""This old girl? She's reliable. Saved our necks in three continents and two wars. She never jams.""
​Alex: ""I know, I know. But come on, 'Old Man,' you're facing the Afrika Korps, not Pancho Villa. You're still using a late-20s submachine gun and a 19th-century handgun? You'd think we could be a little period-appropriate.""

​(Alex walks over to the supply truck, pulling out a heavy, efficient Bren light machine gun.)
​Alex: ""If we're going to fight Nazis who think machine guns are going to stop Mummies, we need something that can actually chew through some steel and maybe hold up to a few thousand pounds of sand. This is 1944. Use this.""
​(Ardeth Bay, inspecting his own traditional Medjai gear, gave a rare, subtle nod to Alex.)

​Ardeth Bay: ""The son is correct, Jonathan. Efficiency and superior range are necessities when facing a disciplined army. Your weapon, while reliable, is perhaps..."" (He pauses, choosing the perfect word.) ""...quaint.""
​(Rick snaps back, stung by the double critique.)

​Rick: ""Oh, no one asked you to get involved, Ardeth! And you want to talk 'quaint'? Are you still using that Winchester Model 1897 shotgun? I think that thing saw the Boxer Rebellion!""
​Ardeth Bay: (Raises one eyebrow.) ""It is a time-tested weapon. And unlike your Thompson, it does not require a constant supply of temperamental drum magazines.""
​Rick: (Sighing, grabbing the Bren from Alex.) ""Fine! Fine! But if we run out of ammo, I'm using your eyeliner as war paint, Ardeth.""

​They piled into the truck, ready for the long journey across the sea and into the North African desert.

​Chapter 4: Under Fire

​(Mid-journey, Military Train, North Africa)
​The journey across the Mediterranean had been tense, but the passage into the African theatre was immediately chaotic. The team was now aboard a high-value military supply train heading deep into Egypt.

​Suddenly, the train lurched violently as high-velocity machine gun fire stitched across the top of the cars. The air screamed with the familiar sound of diving aircraft.
​Rick: (Diving for cover under a metal bench.) ""Dogfight! Get down! This is why I hate trains!""

​Rick grabbed a radio headset from the communication officer.
​Rick: ""Hello? Hello! This is Transport... 37 Alpha! We're under heavy attack, repeat, heavy attack! Where's our air cover?""
​Radio Operator (via static): ""37 Alpha, this is Command. We read you. British squadrons are tied up over Tobruk. Americans can't get to you in time. You are on your own, good luck!""
​Rick ripped off the headset, a familiar spark of reckless adventure igniting in his eyes as he looked at Ardeth. ""Looks like we're the air cover, Ardeth.""

​Evy: (Grabbing Rick's arm, her voice sharp with pure, married exasperation.) ""Don't you get sidetracked again, Richard! The last time you did this, we ended up having to save a bunch of Americans only to watch them get killed! Every single time you do your stupid shenanigans, someone gets killed! Just stay put, we have a Pharaoh to stop!""

​(Rick was already halfway out the roof hatch, grabbing a spare Lewis gun mounted near the door.)
​Rick: ""Sorry, Evy! I think the word you were looking for was 'heroism!'""
​(Cut to a spectacular visual: Rick O'Connell, completely exposed on the roof of the moving train, bracing the Lewis gun and opening fire on the diving German planes. He was single-handedly taking on the Luftwaffe.)

​Chapter 5: Interrogation and Insults

​(The next day, German encampment,
 Egyptian Desert)
​Rick's heroism proved costly. While covering the train's escape, he was cut off and captured by a detachment of the German Scholar’s men.
​He was now tied tightly to a rickety wooden chair inside a tent, facing the cold, intellectual fury of the German-Egyptian Scholar.
​Scholar: (Leaning in, speaking perfect English with cold contempt.) ""We have the books, O'Connell. We have the location of the Sword. You have wasted our time. Now, where is your wife's research on the Amulet of Binding?""

​Rick: (Sighs dramatically.) ""Geez, tough crowd. You know, you guys really went for the whole 'evil, dramatic aesthetic,' didn't you? All the black leather, the skull pins, the little postage stamp mustache... it's a bit much, honestly. You look like a band of rejected barbers from a really bad musical.""

​Scholar: (Ignoring the insult, he picked up a wicked-looking tool.) ""We know you are vulnerable to pain, O'Connell. Tell me the Amulet's location, or this will be very unpleasant.""
​Rick: (Tilting his head, looking bored.) ""Okay, okay, fine. But can we do a quick joke first? I just thought of one.""
​Scholar: (Sighs, utterly exasperated.) ""Who is there?""
​Rick: ""Vee.""
​Scholar: ""Vee who?""
​Rick: (Pulls a ridiculous, thick German accent.) ""Vee would like to remind you zat Vee ask the questions!""
​(Just as Rick delivered the punchline, a large, angry Interrogator Officer stomped into the tent, having been summoned by the Scholar to commence the torture.)
​Interrogator/Officer: (Roaring.) ""What is this nonsense?! What is the meaning of this distraction? Get on with the work!""
​(The chaos had begun. Rick used the momentary confusion to throw himself forward, sending the Scholar tumbling. He was struggling with his bindings when the back of the tent was suddenly slit open by a knife.)

​Alex: (Walking in, looking very smug, carrying a British Sten gun.) ""Need a hand, Dad? Man, I thought I was supposed to be the one getting caught in the final act.""
​Rick: (Still struggling with the ropes.) ""Nah, I had it under control. Honestly, I kind of wanted to have some fun. Besides, you're talking to the guy who's been fighting these clowns since the start of this whole mess. This is just standard operating procedure.""
​Alex: (With a knowing, eye-rolling smirk.) ""Yeah, you keep telling yourself that, old man.""
​(Rick was finally free. He grabbed his beloved Thompson from a nearby table, giving it a quick kiss.)
​Rick: ""Hello, baby. Sorry I was gone.""
​(Evy and Jonathan, having just secured the perimeter, walked into the tent, their faces a mix of relief and annoyance.)
​Evy: (Deadpan.) ""Oh, for heaven's sake, Richard. Would you stop giving your toys more attention than you do with me? We have a pharaoh to stop.""

​Rick: (Winking.) ""Only when your toys start shooting back, sweetheart.”
Chapter 6: The Trail of the Dead
​(The Great Western Desert, En Route to the Valley of the Kings)
​The O'Connells, Medjai, and Jonathan—now driving an armored military truck, having left the humiliated Nazis behind—were in a race against time. The German Scholar and his remaining forces were ahead, using captured British maps to pinpoint Seti I's hidden tomb.
​The landscape was rapidly changing from open desert to the rocky, labyrinthine terrain that concealed ancient burial grounds. Evy, clutching a copy of a translated Medjai scroll, warned them.
​Evy: ""The texts say Seti I's rising is not a localized event. His rage will animate every corpse that has perished in the soil, sacred or unholy.""
​They rounded a bend and found horrifying proof.

​Ahead, a newly excavated archaeological camp was silent. Tables were overturned, and tools lay scattered. They dismounted, weapons ready.
​Jonathan: (Whispering, terrified.) ""Where are the archaeologists?""
​Suddenly, a series of low, guttural hisses echoed from a nearby trench. A shadow erupted from the earth—a massive, grey shape, stitched with brittle, torn linen. It was a mummified Nile Crocodile, its jaws snapping with unnatural speed.
​Rick: ""Crikey! Get to the truck!""

​The attack was instant and relentless. Dozens of smaller threats emerged: swarms of mummified cats, their dried claws scrabbling on the rocks, and clouds of desiccated bats that filled the air, causing the truck's engine to sputter.
​Alex: (Firing his Bren gun to clear a path, his face grim.) ""They’re not just reanimating humans, they’re reanimating the offerings!""

​Grace Bay: (Her Medjai blade flashing as she dispatched a mummified cat.) ""The ritual is taking root in the earth! The ancient power is calling forth all things meant for the gods!""
​They battled their way back to the truck. As they sped away, Rick glanced in the side mirror and saw a familiar, horrifying figure rising from a pit behind the camp: a pathetic, scarab-eaten corpse, shambling awkwardly, its only identifiable marks a ragged fez and tattered coat.
​Rick: (Eyes wide with a sickening realization.) ""Beni Gabor! Hello, my old friend, friend... my old friend.""
​Rick didn't hesitate. He grabbed the Model 1897 shotgun from the rack. As the truck sped away, he leaned out the window and blasted the miserable, undead form of his old traitorous companion.

​Evy: (Not even looking back.) ""Well, that saves us fifteen minutes.""
​Rick: (Sighing, reloading.) ""I still feel I should have sent him a strongly worded letter.""

​Chapter 7: The Choice of Evils

​(The outskirts of the Valley of the Kings)
​They caught up to the Nazi forces just as the Scholars' men were converging on a massive, hidden stone temple entrance, deep in the Valley.
​Ardeth Bay: (Pointing to the German Scholar’s men, who were setting up the Books and the Golden Sword.) ""They are beginning the full ritual! We must stop the binding process before Seti I rises with the sword in hand!""
​They launched a desperate assault. In the ensuing firefight against the Nazis, Rick's Thompson—the subject of so much pride—jammed completely.

​Rick: (Frustrated, throwing the gun down.) ""Come on, baby! Argh! Alex! You ain't got any other toys in that bag of yours?""
​Alex: (Coolly dropping his Bren gun and pulling out a Sten.) ""I told you not to rely on it, Dad! But what did you do? You relied on it! This is the difference between you and I, old man! I use up-to-date stuff, you use museum pieces!""
​Rick: (Snatching the Sten, saving himself from a German soldier.) ""Yeah, yeah, the history lesson is great! Now just hurry up and give me a different gun before I come over there and buy you a pony you don't want!""

​But they were too late. The German Scholar had placed the Golden Sword on the altar, and the Books of the Dead and Living were opened. The ground shook violently.
​Seti I rose, magnificent and terrifying, armored in gold, wielding the Sword. He let out a shriek of rage that traveled on the desert wind, and the ground began to boil as thousands of ancient corpses—Pharaohs, soldiers, and creatures—began to emerge.

​In the ensuing chaos, the Scholar was nearly triumphant, but he was cornered by Alex and Grace. Utilizing his fencing training and Grace's lethal Medjai skill, they fought the enraged human villain. It ended with Alex delivering a brutal, decisive blow.

​Alex: (Standing over the fallen human enemy.) ""One less fascist to worry about.""
​But the nightmare was just beginning. The Nazi high command, having tracked the O’Connells and the Medjai to the area, had found the location of Imhotep’s secured chest in a nearby Egyptian archive. Believing the chest contained the ultimate weapon, they stole it and recklessly opened it in a transport truck.
​(A flash of dark energy erupted kilometers away, instantly followed by an unnatural silence.)

​Ardeth Bay: (Looking utterly desolate.) ""The fool unlocked him. Seti I's rising has created the perfect vessel for his power. We had no choice... but now, we have unleashed a god.""
​Chapter 8: The Five-Way War
​(The Valley of the Kings / North African Campaign Front)
​The conflict immediately merged with the ongoing global war. German and British forces—already battling over crucial supply lines—were now facing two supernatural armies.

​The sight was apocalyptic. Tanks exploded as mummies swarmed their treads or as Seti I's raw power flipped them like toys. Spitfires and Hurricanes were dismantled by swarms of mummified bats or simply torn apart by unseen forces as they dared to fly over the Valley.
​Jonathan: (Cowering in a trench, radioing frantic reports.) ""They—they need to withdraw! It's not working! The Mummies are immune to shellfire!""
​Then, a new wave of horror emerged: a horde of infected townspeople—sentient, screaming zombies—sent by the newly resurrected Imhotep to sow complete chaos.

​Imhotep, glowing with unnatural, dark gold power, landed atop the highest structure of the ruins. He was enraged by Seti I's attempt to usurp his position as the undead king of Egypt.
​Rick: (Dodging a blast of Seti's energy, scrambling away with Evy and Alex.) ""Now that's what you get for trusting a mummy! What did we learn? Never trust The Undead! But what did we do? We went and trusted The Undead! See? This is why you don't listen to me! See, if you all listened to me, none of this stuff would ever happen!""

​The two divine mummies clashed. Imhotep and Seti I fought a cataclysmic, magical duel amidst the warring armies. Imhotep, strengthened by his recent, successful resurrection, ultimately triumphed, reducing Seti I to dust.
​But as Seti I dissolved, Imhotep seized the Golden Sword and immediately asserted command over the combined Army of the Dead, the mummified animals, and the infected horde. He had achieved the godhood he always craved.
​Chapter 9: The Sacrifice and the Amulet
​The final battle moved to the sheer face of the largest Pyramid overlooking the Valley. Imhotep, fully powered, was almost godlike, radiating golden light as planes fell and tanks exploded around him.
​The O'Connells and Medjai were cornered, with Evy frantically trying to translate the final key to the Amulet of Binding.
​Evy: (Pinned down by a reanimated Egyptian guard, screaming at Jonathan, who was desperately trying to read the hieroglyphs.) 

""The second verse, Jonathan! The second verse! I can't reach the Amulet! Translate it!""
​Jonathan: (Voice squeaking with terror.) ""It says... 'Only through the binding of true sacrifice can the High Priest—'""
​Imhotep saw the Amulet and focused his full, lethal power on Evy and the ritual.
​Seeing the end approach, Ardeth Bay stepped forward. He pushed Grace back, handing her a key scroll. ""You lead them now, my daughter. Protect them. Protect the world.""

​Ardeth raised his arms, channeling ancient Medjai energies into a blinding burst of light, momentarily staggering Imhotep and creating a crucial barrier. The sacrifice bought Evy the necessary seconds.
​Grace: (Screaming, watching her father make the ultimate stand.) ""Father, no!""
​Evy: (Tears streaming down her face, finally grabbing the Amulet and finishing the ritual.) ""He is bound! Richard, now!""
​Rick, tears of rage and grief blinding him, charged through the collapsing light, throwing the Amulet of Binding with all his strength. It struck Imhotep in the chest.
​Imhotep roared—not in triumph, but in final agony. His golden glow faded, the light sucked inward. His essence was violently pulled into the small Amulet, which clattered silently to the stone.
​Ardeth Bay's body collapsed, his sacrifice complete. The Army of the Dead and the Infected Horde instantly crumbled to dust. The chaos ended.

​Epilogue: Tidy Conclusions
​(London, Weeks Later. The War Room.)
​The world was safe, though the official records were a mess. After confirming the destruction of Imhotep's essence, Grace Bay, now the new Medjai leader, took the Amulet into permanent custody.
​The O'Connells were back in London. Alex and Grace shared a private, lingering kiss—a silent promise for the future.
​Later, Rick, dusty and dishevelled, sat before Winston Churchill, who was smoking a cigar behind his desk.
​Rick: (Gesticulating wildly.) ""...and then, Mr. Prime Minister, that's when the big bald magic dude comes out, right? He took the army, but we hit him with this little amulet thingy, psshhew, and he was gone. And then the Nazis all ran away.""

​(Churchill was utterly silent, trying to maintain his composure but failing to hide the slight quiver of his lip.)
​Churchill: ""Mr. O'Connell. I simply cannot, for the record, acknowledge this report. The official communiqué will state 'a decisive tactical advantage was secured by our Eighth Army in the late hours of the night.' You understand, O'Connell? This is not to be spoken of.""

​(Evy, looking sharp and professional, stepped forward, placing a perfectly organized file on the desk.)
​Evy: ""With all due respect, sir, if I may. We have recovered a preliminary report from the British officers on the ground, and my chemical analysis of the affected sand indicates a rapid decomposition of mineral structure consistent with exposure to high-level sorcerous energies tied to ancient funerary rituals.""
​(Churchill picked up the file, glanced at Evy's professional summation, and nodded slowly, his face now grim.)
​Churchill: ""Ah. 'Sorcerous energies,' Mrs. O'Connell. A much tidier explanation. Very well. The world remains safe, thanks to the O'Connells'... unorthodox field research. Now, good day.""

​(Final Shot: Rick and Evy walk out into the London air, sharing a knowing smile. They had saved the world from the greatest magical and human threats, and now, they had only Ardeth’s memory to carry forward.)

It defines a mind that is constantly buzzing, calculating, and talking a total inability to chill out.

The biggest problem is that you think your feelings instead of feeling them. Your mind's dual nature means that every emotional moment is immediately split into two debates: ""Should I?"" and ""What's the smart way?"" This scattering means the mind is never settled or fully committed to an emotion or a decision.

The free will: This constant agitation is a karma machine. Because your mind moves so fast and sees so many options (free will), every single thought and casual word you drop becomes a potential action. You are constantly initiating new paths, new gossips, new schemes, new connections. This massive volume of activity rapidly generates new karma (for better or worse) because you are always choosing and always moving the goalposts.

1pgwmdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/easyway/comments/1pgwmdq/bad_sugar/,Bad sugar,"Dear community, I need some help in killing the bad sugar monster.

Let me first say that I have some great experiences with Allen Carr. I quit smoking about 18 years ago and haven't missed it a day since. (Actually, I sometimes wish I'd smoke, just to get that enormous thrill I got when I figured I had killed the big monster and was free.)

I quit alcohol a few years back, although it took a couple of tries (only read the book once, though). I’ve also quit all addictive social media with Smart phone dumb phone and applied the same method to quit caffeine. (Without reading the book. I just figured I could apply the same A.C. arguments to coffee, and it worked.)

So far, so good.

The problem is that I'm having severe difficulties quitting bad sugar. I've read Bad sugar good sugar four or five times over the past five years, and every time everything seems ok. I'm convinced. I go through the final bad sugar meal, make the vow, and stop eating bad sugar. For a while. Then comes Christmas or a birthday at work or something similar, and I'm tempted by some dark chocolate cake. I know all the arguments by heart, I know what roller coaster of high and low glucose levels awaits, followed by lethargy and self loathing, but still I have “just the one”. And there I am, back again, craving sugar like a smoker craves nicotine.

I think the problem is that I haven't completely bought the argument that it doesn't taste good. Because it does taste good to me.
Also, even though I've been out of shape for some periods of my life, I've never been overweight and I am quite fit now, so people (including my wife and family) don't understand my fuss over sugar. They don't understand that I see it (and it feels) as destructive as smoking, gambling or any other addiction – even if it seems under control.

Has anyone here experienced the same? Any tips? How did you break free? I'm getting desperate here.

By the way, there are no A.C. clinics in Norway (where I live), so that isn't an option for me.",2,1765149156.0,easyway,2,1.0,False

1pgwlfw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pgwlfw,Lost my little bud,"My little Normie left us last week after a long battle with kidney failure. I can still remember when I first saw a picture of a 6 week old Normie on a Facebook group, someone who found him in front of a cafe roaming with a gang of cats was looking to re-home him instead of going to a shelter. I had never had a pet before, but went to go see him to see if he was the one. We awkwardly sat on a couch next to each other, and then he gave me a little kiss on my hand and I knew he was mine.

Over the last 8 years he and I lived in 6 different apartments, traveled thousands of miles, fostered 8 kittens, kept each other sane during COVID, hosted family and friends, converted folks to become cat lovers, and inspired others to adopt and foster. He taught me about boundaries, selfless love, patience, and how to ease into a quieter life. He never left my side through cancer and surgery, and always forgave me when I was gone too long or made a mistake. He had a big personality, a large capacity for love, and was the biggest goof.

I feel robbed because he was only 8 years old, he was up against weak kidneys and bladder blockages since he was young, but was mentally so resilient - he wanted to live but his body failed him. Up until the end he was running and playing and demanding treats, he even caught a mouse only one week prior and went into the snow only days before.

In the end, he was surrounded by me and my family, in our last moments he recognized our voices and our faces and started meowing (complaining in Normie fashion) about being in the hospital. We held him, took him outside one final time, and let him go.

I miss him the most in the mornings when we wake up together and watch the sunrise together and cuddle during coffee, and in the evenings when we watched television and ate dinner together and playing before going to bed. He was a vital part of my journey in becoming an adult in my 20s, and he'll be part of me always.

1pgwl7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pgwl7z/is_my_wife_an_addict_and_is_it_time_to_leave_33m/,"Is my wife an addict, and is it time to leave? 33m 39F","Throwaway to not have potential family or wife see this post. IM sorry if this gets long. I think I know the answer but am looking for some other spins on it. If you want to skip to the main story, paragraph 4 is where I get into the main issue. TLDR at the bottom.

We dated starting in March 2021, she moved in to my house in April 2022. Married in Jan 2024. This is her second marriage, my first. I had 5 serious relationships prior to this one. So not really newbie but obviously divorce is a lot different than just breaking up.

I take great fault in living in the honeymoon stage for a long time and not really seeing, or seeing the problem and not addressing it until this past year, and unfortunately I think it's too late. She was divorced from her daughter's birth father citing he was abusive. They have been divorced for over a decade she dated two people in-between him and me. She had full custody (daughter is adult now). Ive met her ex a few times and he seems mostly level headed these days and has two kids with is current wife. They both get into childish arguments/whos in more control when it comes to their daughter (my step daughter).

For some context. Step daughter was a freshmen in HS when they moved in. She would split time between living with us or family close by school. My house is/was about an hour away from where her daughter went to school. After we got married we moved out of my house and bought a place up in the same city and school district. We still have my old house and plan to move back there as both of us much prefer the town my house is in (coastal beach town). SD graduated and is at college. We have our current house up for rent and are ready to move asap as there is nothing keeping us here in a town we hate TBH. Wife also wants to go back to school to further her career (she has an associates, wants to get a masters), the school she wants to go to is much closer to our original house so it does work out. I support this fully. So we have a lot of life changes going on at the moment. Mostly positive other than my wife feeling empty nester syndrome (I don't feel this way. Step daughter could be hard to live with but that's a story for another time).

Back in February of this year I noticed were seriously over budget each month. I traced it down to exactly how much she is spending at the ABC Store (where we buy liquor in our state) and did the math and between liquor, wine, and cigarettes she was spending over 1500 a month on my credit card she is an authorized user on, and she was spending her salary on adderall.  She has a prescription for it but her justification to buying extra illegally was she doesn't feel the effects of it just following the prescribed amount. (I work full time, she currently works less than 15 Hours a week and maybe makes 500-750 per month take home, this is a basic retail job just to get her out of the house that was supposed to help her drink less). We are not broke, I come from a well off family and have a ton of family support both emotionally and financially. But im a budgeter/saver and living with a spender is tough. Especially when I pay the mortgage on both houses, our car lease payments (leased cars hold no value in divorce the family lawyer advised), credit cards, etc and her money is her money. We do have a prenup.

I confronted her about this, told her it stops, we had a huge argument and I left for a week to stay in our old house (I don't rent it out, we use it as our vacation home knowing we were going to move back full time when SD graduated HS). I stayed for over a week. Until she came down and she promised to change. She to her credit did stop buying adderall illegally and just gets what she is prescribed but I have noticed lately she runs out early. She also is on Xanax and Haloperidol (for help sleeping she says). She takes adderall immediately after getting up and Xanax when she says she anxious. Which she also takes double of and runs out (then drinks more to compensate). Haloperidol she takes at night as prescribed.

But since Feb of this year we have had the same cycle of arguments over how much she drinks, she says she will slow down, she does for a few days, then tries to hide how much she's drinking, I find out, we argue again, etc. But it's the same thing each time. I tell her 2 bottles of wine a night is absolutely a problem and there is still the issue of this is costing us 750 bucks a month on a useless addiction not counting her half a pack a day smoking problem ( I am not a smoker and am a very light social drinker at best, I can go weeks without alcohol, now coffee and Coke Zero, yeah I have a problem there lol).

But she refuses to see 2 bottles of wine a day as a drinking problem (sometimes more or she will switch to having a beer or something if she runs out and can't drive to get more) I have told her she has proven to me she is not in control or she just doesn't care or want to solve it. I have offered her to go to rehab, see an addiction therapist, AA etc and every time is ""absolutely not"". After an argument she will slow down. We have done the whole ""ok I wont drink until 5 pm even on days off"" or ""I will slow down to one bottle a night"" Or ""ok 4 glasses a night"" and it slowly but surly becomes more until were back to square one. the glasses go from standard pours to top of the cup, etc, then the drinking starts as soon as she's up and she hopes I don't notice.

I come home from work and can immediately tell just from the sound of her voice she's been drinking. But she would always say im wrong until I finally put a camera up in the kitchen and called her bluff. This worked for a bit and now she just doesn't care and does it when she feels like, and we continue to have the same argument over and over.

I don't want to live like this anymore. I can't keep my own alcohol in the house without it being drunk by her, even if I hide it somehow she will find it.  Im so emotionally worn out from having the same argument over and over. Her apologizing and ""this time it will be different"" and then a week later she's back to the way it was. Between the needless expense and the fact that im embarrassed to take her places knowing she will over indulge and act out.

I'm just tired. I do love her will all my heart but even then this isnt fair to me to have to live like this day in and day out. She absolutely refuses to see it as a problem and refuses to get help, other than marriage counseling which makes me think she sees me as the problem not her.

Other than canceling all her cards and not giving her the ability to buy alcohol I don't see how this gets better. But then she doest have the ability to do basic things like gas her car, get her nails done, etc, and I feel like an extremely controlling abusive spouse doing this.

This last week I have been sleeping in the guest room, but I am ready to leave, the energy and pins in needles feeling in the house is just getting awful.  We both have just been on auto pilot and barely speaking to each other except ""what do you want for dinner"" and ""im leaving for work"" etc.  Ive talked with my mom about it and she is in full support of me leaving. But im not sure what happens to our main house, my dog, the furniture in that place, the fact that both cars are in my name, My boat and jet skis are in the detached garage out back, etc. (all except the house I had prior to marriage ) It's not easy for me to just throw a suit case into the car and leave. I don't want to leave my entire life at the house.

My mom told me to just pack a suit case with clothes and anything small and sentimental and my dog and leave an worry about that stuff later and I believe she's right. But I still (probably stupidly) believe there is hope things could change. Im just not sure how to do it and if I need to leave to prove to her im at the end here. I believe if she would get help we could be so much better.

TLDR. Wife drinks 2 bottles of wine a day+ adderall, and Xanax. We argue weekly about it and she refuses to get help.



Edit to add for visibility- 

On the meds her ""DR"" that prescribed her meds I think is an absolute quack. She trows at her whatever she thinks will solve the immediate problem and does nothing to solve the deep rooted problems. I know haloperidol is for people with schizophrenia. I don't think she has that. Literally this Dr threw this set of pills at her to help her sleep as her body is so messed up on uppers and downers. She switched her from Seroquel (SP?) to Haloperidol about 2 years ago as my wife complained of weight gain from the Seroquel. This DR hasn't helped her situation at all and in a lot of ways made it worse. IDK If there's some kind of Malpractice suit here or what. Or if she is just telling my wife it's for sleep and knows there's something more wrong with her? No idea here.

I have some vacation time saved up and will most likely take this week off to get my ducks in a row. I actually just got off the phone with my mom and she basically echos what everyone says on here, she told me to get the locks changed on the house once I get down there, and other than my pup the rest of the things are just things don't worry about them and she's right.",42,1765149067.0,relationship_advice,108,0.87,False

I (27f) have been dating Andrew (26m) for 3 years. We live together and have a 1 year old son together. We have a really great relationship as far as I can tell. We spend time together regularly, we help each other with chores, our parenting styles align well, we communicate and we have spicy sleep often. He’s a great partner, and even better father to our son. We’re always laughing together and he’s finding new ways to make me feel loved. 

Now for the issue at hand. Andrew matched with Tracy (24f) on Bumble before we met. They lived on opposite ends of the country so they never met in person. He also travels a lot for work and has a very busy schedule so there was never a real opportunity for them to ever meet up. They spoke for about 7 months. During the time they were speaking, they spoke daily, exchanged spicy photos and had spicy phone calls. They also had what he calls a strong emotional bond. He ended things with her a little while before we met because the distance wasn’t working. 

When I started dating Andrew, Tracy would check my IG stories and often like and unlike my photos. I didn’t even know who she was and Andrew eventually told me who she was. I blocked her and told him i didn’t like what she was doing because it felt like she was trying to intimidate me. She then reached out to him and he told her that he’s in a relationship. Tracy was upset because she felt like he used her. He cleared the air with her and severed ties on okay terms.

Later that year she reached out to him saying she had a work event happening in our town and she wanted to meet up with him for a coffee. He told me about it. I said I wasn’t comfortable with it but he can do what he wants to do. He ultimately decided not to go. 

There was another instance when I was pregnant and she reached out again wanting to speak to him. They spoke over the phone and he said they just caught up and had a platonic conversation. Again, I told him I didn’t like it. He promised not to speak to her again.

Fast forward to today. Andrew comes home from a work trip (he was gone for 3 weeks), and we were in our little cocoon of love. We fell asleep and our phones were somewhere in the bed. Our son woke up at around 3am for a feed and I couldn’t find my phone so I grabbed Andrew’s phone to call mine. As I opened the phone app, I saw Tracy’s name in the call logs from when he was away on business. I asked Andrew about it and he says he was just thinking about her and wanted to catch up, he also added that eventually he was going to tell me about it, something that I can’t verify.

So we had a conversation about this whole situation. Long story short: Andrew feels like he has a connection with Tracy and he enjoys talking to her. He suggested maintaining contact on a semi frequent basis, to catch up with her.
I feel like this is an emotional affair and it makes me feel very insecure because the only reason they never got together is distance. So AITAH for wanting him to cut her off?",5,1765148940.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

1pgwj6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1pgwj6c/you_are_committing_financial_abuse/,"""You are Committing Financial Abuse!""","One of m ex uBPD's favorite phrases the last few months before the discard. I supported her and her children for over two years paying about 90-95% of everything (rent, utilities, bills, car, insurance, etc...) and in the end she told me ""you never contributed anything to us."" I had never heard of financial abuse until my ex yelled this at me one afternoon and then my therapist educated me on it. There have been several posts lately on this topic, so I wanted to share what I experienced.

1. About 4 months before the final discard I asked my ex if she could help with the rent. I had been supporting all 4 of us in a very expensive city and was starting to struggle financially (our rent alone was over $2000 per month). My ex had a hard time finding and holding onto a job. When she was working the most she ever contributed was $500 toward the rent. When I asked nicely about rent assistance and explained why, she told me ""I was financially abusive and trying to control everything."" I tried to explained the only thing I was trying to control was my bank account from getting wiped out. 

2. Several weeks before this she told me ""I don't trust that you are actually paying the rent and bills each month and a show of trust would be depositing your entire paycheck into our small joint account so I can see the proof."" I had been paying rent for over 2 years and she had never even asked once. I declined and told her I was keeping my separate account, but would be happy to share the canceled check and/or bank statements. The first time I ever heard ""you are committing financial abuse by not putting your check in the joint acccount..."" 

3. She would regularly use my debit card to buy groceries, snacks, gas, makeup, and other miscellaneous items. However, for months, especially when she wasn't working, she would scream at me that ""she can't afford body wash while I buy fancy coffee every day."" I did buy coffee each day at lunch. The $3 was my one ""extravagance"" I treated myself to. I didn't go out to eat, buy new shoes or clothes, or books (I love to read). My entire paycheck went to cover our family expenses and my bills. She once got a $500 tattoo on my debit and texted me ""hey, got a tattoo today. Thank you..."" 

4. She blamed me for her terrible credit. This was something I heard for a year and realize now it was all a projection due to shame. She had wanted to buy a house, so when we went to get pre-approved the mortgage person called me and said ""has she mentioned her credit to you? It is really, really bad. We can't process the application with her on it."" When we talked, she got really defensive and said ""I didn't think they would actually check"" and nothing more. This was actually a positive for me as we never did buy that house she wanted. Later on I had to take out a car loan because her credit was so bad she didn't even qualify for an auto loan. She promised to make the monthly car and insurance payments. Let's say I saw a total of 1 payment. She told me ""only idiots have car insurance."" 

5. I paid for one of her child's unexpected dental bills when the child came to me. They did not have insurance and apparently had stopped paying (both my ex and the child's father), so the dentist cut them off from treatment. I paid the back payments along with all the treatments after because I cared. Later my ex would turn this against me with ""you just did this to control me."" I did it because the child needed it and her parents were not responsible enough (the ex-husband not paying support should have been another red flag). 

6. Finally, after I left the relationship, I discovered she had defaulted on her student loans and had been sued 7 times in the past decade for failure to pay and 2 evictions. Her credit was destroyed long before I came around. 

My advice is be careful with your finances and don't give in when you get hit with the ""sad stories"" and heavy guilt. I was very open and transparent about mine (spread sheet of monthly expenses for us and myself, monthly salary, savings, retirement, etc.), while she was always very guarded. To this day, I have no idea how many credit cards she had. Anytime we scheduled a family meeting, she would have a meltdown or family crisis. I should have set boundaries early, but wanted to provide for her and her children. I also should have been firm on having a family financial discussion. 

She used guilt to try and take control of my finances. I am lucky I got out with a little left. I figure it will take me at least 2 years to be financially sound again. I was in great shape before I met her. Your partner needs to be honest and transparent. In my healthy relationships, we split the monthly expenses 50/50 and always talked if one was struggling. We also knew where we both stood on credit and bought homes and cars together... I am partially to blame in this relationship for not setting boundaries, not asking more questions (but we all trust our partners, right?), and being a ""caretaker"" personality. All of this cost me dearly emotionally, financially, and physically. Similar stories and experiences? ",2,1765148911.0,BPDlovedones,1,1.0,False
1pgwia5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianConservative/comments/1pgwia5/as_a_young_canadian_busting_his_ass_to_pull/,As a young Canadian busting his ass to pull together the “Canadian Dream” I have come to hate boomers and millennials so intensely.,"So I’m Gen Z, an ‘01 baby. And I will be the first to tell you that my generation sucks. A lot of them are useless burnouts and have zero ambition. They take one look at this country and just throw their arms up and give up on ever making something of themselves.

But I can also say that Boomers are some of the dumbest, most selfish, entitled, pretentious crybabies on earth. And after this latest election, just the sight of some old geezer driving with an “elbows up” sticker on their car makes me want to roll my window down and dump my coffee all over the side of their car.

For a generation that says we want everything handed to us, they sure had every opportunity served up on a silver platter. They truly got to enjoy Canada at it’s peak, at its most magnificent, at its greatest. When you could work on a factory line being a wageslave and buy a middle class home in Toronto, or any major city. When things like buying a starter home, then later your forever home, having a nice retirement, putting your kids through school, and being mortgage free were all things that were basically guaranteed in your lifetime as long as you worked a decent job. When you had the SIMPLE luxury of being able to buy a house, support a family and put down roots in the PLACE YOU GREW UP.

I’ve talked to, and argued with a lot of older folks this year, and it’s always the exact same. Especially online. They see my age, automatically tell me I should be grateful to live here and not in the states, that I’m just a whiny kid who doesn’t work hard, that I probably rely on my parents for everything, and that I’m a “Maple Magat” for not being satisfied with our standard of living. They send these messages on their Pontoon boat at the lake on a Tuesday of course, or from their $1M acerage, or from Puerto Rico, where they live half the year, despite working some super modest job never making more than like $80k/yr their entire lives. 

Admittedly I was young the last time conservatives were in power. And boomer liberals assure me life was much worse, But I just don’t see how that can be. Economically, I remember my childhood being pretty pleasant. My dad worked on a factory line, my mom was a stay at home, he supported her, six kids, had 2 vehicles, and rented a 4 bedroom house just outside the GTA on less than 20 bucks an hour. Even when the recession hit, sure it hurt us, but we never lost any of it.

That is just simply unheard of and not possible today. My family isn’t a great example, I’m the only one out 6 and both parents to even graduate highschool. None of them ever owned a home or had a career.

That being said there was a lot bigger issues in my family than money, and I left home at 15. No one was ever in a position to help me, nor did I ask. I got through highschool living with girlfriends, buddies, sleeping in class because I worked half the night, clawing my way to a decent education, wanting to drop out so bad at times just so I could make a full time paycheck. I put up with shit they don’t even have names for. I struggled for years.

Long story short. I got my diploma, landed a co-op at a welding shop, got ticketed, got 1-2 years of experience, and achieved my dream, landed a job with the boilermaker’s union at 19. Didn’t know anyone, didn’t get referred, I just did it. I’m 24 now, finished my apprenticeship just about a year ago. My life has completely changed. I moved away and bought my first home this year, welcomed a daughter into the world, and I support my gf being a stay at home mom, the baby, 2 vehicles, a mortgage, and enough money left over to do the odd fun thing. I juggle all this while being laid off 4-5 months of the year. It’s not easy or a lavish lifestyle, but it’s mine and believe me, I thank the lucky stars every day because just about every single person I grew up with hasn’t been anywhere near as fortunate. 

That being said, things are way more frustrating than they should be. I make $125k a year. Sounds like a huge number, right? realistically I’m probably left with more like $75k. I had to massively overpay for my house even though I lowered my expectations. I had to work 7 13s for SIX WEEKS at a time when I was saving up the down payment. And then the government would take as much as $6500 a WEEK in tax as a morale booster. I had no life for a couple years of my early 20s that I’ll never get back. Packed up to a rural area where we didn’t know anyone, and could still just barely afford to be in the market, thank god we had no competition. And now it looks like I bought just when the insane housing bubble is starting to burst, so I’ll be lucky if I ever have equity in this house. I’ll be lucky if I don’t end up stuck with this place and ever get to buy my “forever home”. 

Basically, I know it’s not all of them, I’m sure there are some of you in here that haven’t lost your mind with age. But I am SICK of working my bag off for a substandard level of living compared to the crybaby generation that had it all on 40 hours a week. Anyone who voted liberal and fucked my generation over for another god knows how many years, because your life is great, now that you’re an average Joe who became a millionaire off of imaginary home equity under years of insane liberal rule and out of control immigration, and simply tells me to “work harder”, you can sincerely go fuck your fucking self, and I will never respect you. Thanks for listening if you read the whole thing, 


Sincerely, a pissed off young Canadian.

1pgwhwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pennystock/comments/1pgwhwg/for_me_playboy_is_iconic_brand_and_part_of_my/,For me Playboy is iconic brand and part of my childhood and not just a stock to trade,"My grandfather always had the playboys on his lobster pot coffee table with a glass topper. My grandmother would read the articles, she loved it too. It was the very early 90s before Kurt Cobain even died the grandparents house in New Jersey was a place we went in the summer for a week or two when we were on school break.  

We would trespass on golf courses to putt by moonlight and sneak out of our beds past midnight to steal ice cream fro the freezer and read $PLBY magazines.  My brothers liked the pictures and my favorite was the glamorous articles that told of a lifestyle I knew I would never experience for myself.

So I would sneak downstairs at night on those muggy Jersey summer nights and read playboy at 10-12yrs old outside with a flashlight and lightning bugs flickering after dark when everyone was sleeping, long after my brothers were asleep and before the sun came up.

So for me to find out recently that the $PLBY stock was a turnaround meme story unfolding before my eyes, well I was in.  The more DD I did, about the licensing revenue, cash arbitration award, upcoming movies and features, only fans competitor, and even the investors event at Roth Deer Valley this week, I was just hooked.  I did invest in Beyond and I made good profit and still have some shares too. But this just feels right with playboy.  

Maybe it’s just because I am a girl but it’s been decades since I thought of my grandparents, both are passed away now, and remembering those summer time weeks actually got me so choked up I started crying. I do miss them too.

But anyways TLDR: found playboy stock, cried for missed grandparents, did DD, bought playboy stock, believe we have a real meme stock here",9,1765148813.0,Pennystock,1,1.0,False

I would love to get to know you!","Did it work? I'm sure it worked if you're reading this! So hi, I'm shadow\_surf. Imagine if this was my real name. Maybe then people wouldn't butcher it like they do with my real name lol. We've all had that one teacher, right? If not, I'm sure a coffee shop like Starbucks comes up with a creative way to make that happen when writing our name on the cup.

Either way, I'm a 29 year old dude, living his life away on the east coast of the US. Like many of us here, we're looking for that one special someone that will join us on our journey through life. Someone we can truly get to know, bond with, and see develop over time. Sadly, when it comes to finding someone, I've had terrible luck. Feels like a lot of people lose interest very easily or stop replying as time goes on. I'm still holding on to the hope that there is someone out there that is interested in a real, genuine connection and is willing to stick around. Life these last few years have gotten very lonely and it feels many people nowadays just aren't interested in investing the time and effort to make things work. Or they might jump to someone else if they get bored :/ So I'm making this post in the hopes of meeting a long term partner, hoping this post might catch someone's eye!

I'm sitting here near my desk on a boring evening, composing a post to find that amazing, caring person. An individual that is understanding, passionate, loyal, loving, and honest. Just all the beautiful, awesome qualities we would like to find in that special someone. Sure, trying to find someone online can be difficult or take a lot of effort, but I'm holding on to the hope that this catches the attention of someone that is ready to make it work with a guy named shadow\_surf haha.

This is the part I talk a bit about myself. This part is usually what I tend to dread, especially during those ice breakers from the first day in our classes, but thankfully I have some time to think things out rather than be put on the spot. I'm sure most of us dread those...

* Living on a floating rock, revolving around the Sun. If you can guess the precise location, I'll be slightly freaked out but highly impressed!
* A generally quiet dude but can also be rather outgoing at times (especially online)
* I enjoy exploring about, especially in nature, beaches, old abandoned buildings inhabitant by ghosts
* A driven individual where I enjoy working towards the things I'm passionate about  
* Respectful, honest (I suck at telling lies), a listener, enjoy being there for others, understanding, and caring
* Enjoy various hobbies, such as reading novels, writing poetry, video editing, \*attempting\* cooking, gaming, and going to the gym

What qualities do I look for in a partner?

* Is a human and breathing 😂
* Loyal, trusting, and honest
* An individual that sticks around. Not looking for someone that ghosts or disappears after a day or two. (I'm going to bold this statement because I know a lot of people simply stop caring after a day or want to jump to another person or not take the initiative to continue this because they simply get bored). Let's be real about our intentions :)
* Puts effort into the conversation. Those one worded responses truly kill me sometimes. This helps us keep engaged and learn more about one another!
* An understanding and caring individual
