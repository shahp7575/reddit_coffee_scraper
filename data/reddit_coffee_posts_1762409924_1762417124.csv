like I posted prior, went through break-up recently, with the usual, I love you but I’m not in love with you, after 13 years together and married as well.  
while we somewhat kept some contact, in hopes that it will end up being just a temporary separation (since she didn’t really want to divorce), I did ask her to move out, but left her one of my cars, so she can go to work and so on (because I do care).  
I tried to get explanation few times, but always were shut down, with there is nothing to talk about, decision was already made etc.  
I started changing my life, by going to different gym and so on (she rented a room only few miles from our home), but she still texted me every once in a while, which seemed that she actually cared.  
she even showed up with a cake for my birthday, week after moving and kind gave me a night to remember, but acted cold and strange the very next day.  
this past weekend I ran into her again, in a coffee shop that is close to my home and she was having breakfast there, we talked a little and I asked her again, if she is ready to talk, she said nothing to talk about, but texted me later that she stops by costco and can pick up whatever I need also and did drop it off at my house.  
I did ask her one more time, is she ready to talk about it now, but she insisted, that there isn’t anything and that there is not even a chance that we will ever get back together.  
I said ok, if she thinks so, then I will take the car, and drop her off at the new home she has and she can figure everything out herself from there on.

of course I got so much shit about it, how I don’t care about anything, that she needs to get to work next morning etc. but I stood my ground, said that uber is operating and it’s best if everything ends now.

it did break me completely again, I cried for hours in following days, knowing that it really did end there, but never got closure.

  
well until today, when everything came out… since I owned everything that I bought, I decided to start deleting memories, boxing up photos together, erasing joint memberships, joint users etc.  
and also deleting her computer log ins, but what happened next was something I was not prepared for - one of the laptops we have, that she used, had many tabs still open (I guess she just forgot) and one was her email, nothing really popped there, but for some strange reason I clicked on “trash” and oh boy - she actually had emails there that revealed not one but many letters, notes and other forms of other guys.  
after just doing a little research, it was clear, she has been cheating for years, with different guys, it completely destroyed me, could not stop crying. but had to since I had scheduled work call that was very important. did my breathing to calm down, took the call, but of course ended up breaking down in the middle of it. Luckily business partner that I was talking to, went recently through divorce as well and said that don’t change your life because she ruined it and that if anyone should make changes, it should be my now soon to be ex-wife.

so I did follow that step and ended up going to my regular gym in the evening, knowing that she will most likely be there later as well. And she did show up, seemed happy, said hello, asked why such a long face and I replied I had long day, but still alive.  
didn’t talk after that for an hour until our machines lined up and then she started small talk again asking about my day and business, well of course it broke me again, so I said I need to go but can she come outside too.

she did come, I explained my long day, and my phone call with the business partner and asked is there anything she wants to say, but still nothing. so I said, do you want to talk about Antonio (one of the guys, she cheated with) and the way her face changed, holy crap… she still tried to play it down and saying that there isn’t anything to talk, but you could see and feel the panic… so I said I know everything already, time to cut the crap and finally tell me the truth. well I got some of it, she has been cheating for past 3-4 years, while I was on work trips and so on. in matter of fact she already cheated first time 8 years ago…

what a cold shower it was for me, but at the same time I felt the weight moving from my shoulders and I did get my closure - I told her, that now I don’t even need to regret taking everything away from her, that now she has to face the shit show that comes with it and file the divorce the next day, change the addresses, forward her mail and so on, so that I have to never see her face again.

after I left I called my now soon to be ex mother in law, explained everything and said my goodbyes, then called the last guy she cheated with and said as man to man, she was married with me for 13 years but will be soon my ex wife and just so he would know, there was more guys than him and he should go and get tested for std’s.

what a roller coaster, but now I can finally move on, knowing that the person that I married was actually just the worst possible person and I was able to confront her for that and walk away.",2,1762416664.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1opt6u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ratschlag/comments/1opt6u9/wie_kann_ich_meinem_freund_nicht_partner_helfen/,"Wie kann ich meinem Freund (nicht Partner) helfen, Burn-out ? Angst um den Job","Hallo zusammen,

hab für das Thema einen neuen Account erstellt, da Rückschlüsse über meinen Hauptaccount möglich wären.

Mein bester Freund, den ich seit nun rund 35 Jahren kenne, steuert in meinen Augen extrem auf einen Burn-Out oder Depression hin und findet es auch noch lustig und besonders.

Etwas zur Vorgeschichte, wir kennen uns seit der Schulzeit, haben viele gleiche Interessen und sind Best Buddies seit der Kindheit. Ich (m, 39) lebe in einer normalen Beziehung, er (40) ist seit der Jugendzeit Single, ist ein Scheidungskind ohne Aufarbeitung der Kindheit und lebt in einem Goldenen Käfig, vor allem mit seiner Mutter, was an sich natürlich nichts schlechtes.

Sein Tag beginnt meistens erst um 10:00, bis er in der Firma aufschlägt, in der wir gemeinsam arbeiten, ist es oft 13:00 / 14:00. Meistens wird es dann 03:00 nachts bis er die Firma verlässt. Dazwischen geht er jeden Tag mit seiner Mutter in Restaurants essen, danach wieder in die Firma. Das allein die Arbeitszeit einfach nicht gut für die Psyche ist, ist klar.

Sein Leben besteht nur aus Arbeiten und seiner Mutter, die aber selber eine Tonne an Problemen hat und diese auch auf ihn ablädt dann natürlich. Was komplett fehlt ist bei ihm ein ""gesundes"" Ego um sich selber zu schützen. In den letzten 20 Jahren war er 3x im Urlaub, 2mal mit mir und meiner Partnerin. Das war auch ne coole Zeit, aber nach dem Urlaub, wurde dass dann schlecht geredet (vermutlich durch die Mutter) dass wir zuviel Kaffee getrunken haben jeden Tag (z.b. Besuch in London, und dann halt 2-3 pro Tag Kaffee ausm Coffee Shop. Am Flughafen habe ich mir aus Alternativ-Losigkeit beim Starbucks n Kaffee mitgenommen, das wurde dann auch nachträglich massgeregelt wie ich so eine Firma unterstützen kann. Wir versuchen ihn am Wochenende oder in der Freizeit immer mal wieder einzuladen für nen Roadtrip, Tagesausflug, Wandern mitzunehmen, aber da fehlt die Kraft und dann kommt wieder danach sowas wie ""Ihr Umweltverschmutzer, ihr fahrt soviel"". Und wir essen zuviel, man darf nur max. 1x eine Volle Mahlzeit pro Tag zu sich nehmen da man sonst träge wird.

Sein Firmenwagen im Wert von 150k Euro hat ne Laufleistung pro Jahr von 3000km, der Autohändler freut sich jedes mal wenn das Leasing zurückkommt.

So nun die eigentlichen Beweggründe wieso ich davon ausgehe dass er auf einen Burnout hinarbeitet:

\- Wie erwähnt ein wirklich unglücklicher Biorythmus.

\- Bei jedem Gespräch mit Kunden und externen versucht er wie das Alter zu erwähnen. Das man ja in unserem Alter nichts mehr gepacken bekommt, selbst zum gehen auf Hilfe angewiesen ist, der Kopf nachlässt etc. Ich stehe dann oft einfach nur noch daneben, schüttle innerlich mit dem Kopf und sehe richtig bei den Gegenübern wie z.b. Handwerkern die Zörne im Kopf aufsteigen.

\- Alles wird unter den moralischen Kompass der Mutter gestellt, zuviel Kaffee, zuviel Essen, zuviel KM auf dem Auto.

\- Alle 2-3 Wochen ist ihm am Abend kotzübel, hat Schüttelfrost, schläft im Bürostuhl ein, geht dann nach Hause, nimmt n heises Band und am nächsten Tag ist alles wieder super. Krank wird man ja nicht, Hausarzt braucht man auch nicht und Medikamente auch nicht. Er kennt nicht mal seinen Blutdruck.

\- Es fehlt jegliche Energie für irgendwas ausserhalb der Arbeit (meistens aber max. 40h Woche),  nicht mal mehr Biken ist mehr drin. 

\- Viele hochpreisige Sachen werden gekauft wie Konsolen, Küchengeräte , Spiele-PC, Fotoausrüstung, einmal genutzt und dann stehen sie rum. 

\- Burn-Out / Depressionen werden runtergespielt, er ist halt was besonders, das sind halt Macken die er hat. Ich sag ihm oft, das ein Burn-Out einfach nicht lustig ist, die wenigstens kommen davon komplett zurück und sind wieder 100% sich selber, viele kämpfen dann mit den kleinsten Sachen. Krebs kann man im guten Fall rausschneiden und gut ist, Burn-Out wirst du nie mehr los.

Ich habe schon oft mit ihm darüber geredet, dass er etwas mehr Struktur braucht und z.b. ein Haustier, ein Hund oder Katze super wäre, um die er sich kümmern muss.

Neben der Freundschaftlichen Komponente ist bei mir auch die berufliche Komponente: Wir arbeiten in der gleichen Firma im gleichen Bereich,  ich möchte den Job behalten und muss ihn auch behalten aufgrund der aktuellen Arbeitsmarktsituation und der Tatsache das man nicht jünger wird. Dies hängt aber eben neben der Freundschaftlichen Sorge auch viel mit der psychischen Gesundheit meines Freundes ab.

Wie kann ich ihm helfen? Danke euch

1opt5hr,https://www.reddit.com/r/saily/comments/1opt5hr/vietnam_interesting_facts_and_travel_etiquette/,Vietnam: Interesting facts and travel etiquette,"Hey everyone! Pack your bags because this November, we’re off to amazing [Vietnam](https://saily.com/esim-vietnam/)! Get ready to explore beautiful landscapes, rich traditions, and delicious street food. Whether it’s your first trip or you’ve traveled a lot, Vietnam has something for everyone. Let’s check out why this place is a must-visit!

* Vietnam is the second-largest coffee exporter in the world, and their traditional coffee (cà phê sữa đá) is a must-try! It's typically served with sweetened condensed milk over ice, and can be found everywhere, from tiny street cafes to chic coffee shops. 
* Food is amazing over there. We have to start with Pho, the iconic noodle soup with tender beef or chicken, and Bánh Mì, a delicious Vietnamese sandwich packed with flavor. Don’t miss Bún Chả (grilled pork with noodles), Gỏi Cuốn (fresh spring rolls), and the savory Bánh Xèo pancakes. There are even more great meals, and it is impossible to list them all, so be sure to try as much local food as you can, as it’s an essential part of the experience.
* One place you can't miss is the Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park. It's home to some of the largest and most impressive caves in the world, including Son Doong, the largest cave on Earth. You might feel like you're in some adventure movie, and you wouldn't be wrong, as parts of *Kong: Skull Island* were filmed here, with its towering limestone cliffs and lush jungles.
* Located in the Ba Na Hills near Da Nang, you’ll find the Golden Bridge, which is supported by two giant stone hands. It’s one of Vietnam’s most famous landmarks and offers amazing views of the mountains. It’s a great spot for photos!
* Another beautiful spot is Hoan Kiem Lake. This peaceful lake is right in the middle of the city and is home to the Ngoc Son Temple, which sits on a small island. 
* A must-see in Vietnam is water puppetry, an ancient art where wooden puppets perform to live traditional music on water.  It’s a special way to learn about Vietnam’s culture and history, and you can see shows in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City.
* In Halong Bay, you can visit floating fishing villages, where families live and work on the water. 
* The Cu Chi Tunnels offer a fascinating look into the country's past. Used during the Vietnam War, these tunnels were a key part of the Viet Cong’s underground network, allowing them to move, hide, and strategize. 

**Travel etiquette tips for your stay:**

* While many people in Vietnam understand English, knowing a few words in Vietnamese can go a long way. **Xin chào** means Hello*,* **Cảm ơn** means Thank you*,* and **Xin lỗi** means Sorry*.* 
* Vietnam’s traffic can be overwhelming, especially in cities like Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City. Motorbikes are everywhere, and crossing the street can be a challenge. Be cautious when crossing, and follow the locals' lead. 
* Vietnam is a street food paradise, and you’ll likely find yourself eating on tiny plastic stools next to locals. It’s part of the experience! Don’t be shy to sit and enjoy your food at a street stall. Also, it’s common to eat with chopsticks, so give it a try if you’re not already a pro!
* Vietnamese culture holds elders in high regard. It’s important to show respect when interacting with older individuals. A simple greeting or bowing your head slightly can go a long way in showing respect.

Hopefully, this guide helps you get the most out of Vietnam! Thanks for reading, and make sure to share any tips you have in the comments!",2,1762416208.0,saily,0,1.0,False

This post will focus on a selection of questions about Netflix, check out our [Netflix FAQ](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/kdramas_101/netflix_faqs) for even more information.

If you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.

###What is Netflix K-Content?

[Previously known as **The Swoon**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFkLnrtVnjc), **Netflix K-Content** channel on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpiCK8c6PBktcxq7Az_t4RQ) is Netflix's official social media handle for Korean content on Netflix. Be it K-dramas, K-movies, K-variety or K-celebs that's where you want to go for official goodies from Netflix. 

(It's also the only acceptable source of previews/teasers for Netflix productions.)

**What is the difference between ""Netflix Original"" and ""produced by Netflix”?**

**Netflix Original**: Netflix will label any drama they have exclusive streaming rights to in a certain region as an Netflix Original in that region ***even if*** Netflix is only licensing the content and was not part of the production process.

**Produced by Netflix**: these are dramas that Netflix financed and produced (examples include Kingdom, Love Alarm, My Holo Love, Extracurricular).

**Quick tip** to distinguish between a *licensed* Netflix Original and Netflix production: 

> All episodes released on the same day ***worldwide*** = Netflix production

> vs.

> Episodes released weekly concurrent with its airing schedule in Korea ***OR*** the drama finished airing in Korea but is still unavailable on Netflix = a *licensed* Netflix Original

For more info, check out [Netflix’s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976) and the article [The Four Types of Netflix Originals](https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/the-four-types-of-netflix-originals/).

**Why isn’t [drama] available even though it’s airing in Korea?**

***We don’t know, we’re not Netflix.***  When (if ever) a drama comes to Netflix for any given region depends on the licensing agreement Netflix has. For more info, check out [Netflix’s Help page on licensing](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/4976)

**When is [drama] coming to Netflix for my region?**

***We don’t know, we’re not Netflix.*** Netflix tells you to keep browsing the [New Arrivals](http://www.netflix.com/browse/new-arrivals) page and looking out for its announcements via [Press Releases](https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases).

**How Good Are Netflix's Subtitles?**

Not great: they often skip over nuances in the language. 

Common example of subtitle inferiority include use of the ***name*** of a character throughout no matter what that character is being called in the dialogue. This can at times be a spoiler if the dialogue was being purposely vague.

Another ***very common*** complaint is that due Netflix subtitles often contain more cursing/profanity in comparison to what is actually being said in the Korean dialogue. This has been speculated to be attributed to Netflix's choices for localization of subtitles. So just be aware that cursing in kdramas, especially ones broadcast on any of the free to air channels (KBS, MBC, SBS) are relatively rare and mild.

**Which Dramas Are Dubbed?**

Based on user feedback, it seems that Netflix offers dubbing only on Netflix productions. See the Netflix help article on [How to use subtitles, captions, or alternate audio](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/372) to change your options.

**What's with the music?**

Background music in kdramas may be altered on streaming platforms in comparison to original broadcast due to copyright and licensing issues. Streaming sites will replace songs with generic choices if they do not have the correct licensing. In general, the songs being switched out are ***not original*** songs created ***solely*** for the drama, instead they are pre-existing songs.

***Longer Answer***

**Note: The explanation below is a very simplified look at a very complex legal issue. Use it for reference, not authority.**

In terms of licensing, each individual song can be thought of as having two sets of legal rights associated with it: publishing rights and recording rights. Publishing rights refers to the rights of the songwriter (or the publishing company that now hold the rights). Recording rights refer to the rights of that specific recording/performance (usually held by the recording company).

> Example to illustrate the point:
>> Think of the [Auld Lang Syne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auld_Lang_Syne) song.

>> The melody is an old Scottish folk song so ***no songwriter can claim publishing rights for it***. People all around the world can use the melody without having to obtain its publishing rights. In fact, it was used as the tune of the [SK national anthem for a few years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegukga).

>> Now imagine that some Singer X made a recording of a specific performance of the song Auld Lang Syne. This specific recording would have recording rights associated with it but no publishing rights associated with it. 

>> If someone wanted to use this recording made by Singer X in a drama as part of the soundtrack, they would need to license the *rights to use this particular recording* (recording rights). They would not need to obtain publishing rights since no songwriter/publishing company has those rights.


**Now for kdramas:**

The music used in kdramas can be one of three types:

> 1. Previously existing songs,

> 2. A specific recording of a previously existing song made just for the drama (such as a remake), or

> 3. A new song written and recorded specifically for the kdrama.


Of these three types, only types 2 and 3 are included in the kdrama’s OST (original soundtrack) because they were originally *created* for the kdrama.

And of these three types, only type 3 songs are easily licensed for worldwide distribution because both the publishing and recording rights are recently created and generally bundled together with the drama licensing rights.

For type 2 songs, while recording rights may be relatively easy to obtain since the recording was made specifically for the drama, publishing rights may be hard to obtain, especially for worldwide distribution.

For type 1 songs, both publishing and recording rights have to be obtained, making it even harder. Especially if the song is an existing kpop hit song whose international distribution rights are already held by different companies in different regions.


**Now why does Netflix often switch out songs:**

Because the songs switched out are often pre-existing songs that Netflix cannot (or has chosen not to) obtain international licensing rights for. Keep in mind that Netflix is available in ***a lot*** of markets internationally so if they want to license a song, they have to license it for every single market in which this drama will be streamed in. 

So if this drama will be streamed in 20 countries, then Netflix has to obtain song license rights in all 20 countries in order to use it, which can get ***really expensive*** really fast. For songs written and recorded specifically for dramas, licensing is feasible because the song rights are likely bundled with the drama streaming licensing rights, but is near impossible if the song is a pre-existing song with existing distribution deals in different markets. 

> A Hypothetical:

>> **Fire** by BTS was used as the intro song by a character in Fight My Way ([쌈 마이웨이](https://mydramalist.com/22472-fight-for-my-way)).

>> To stream the drama with this song in the USA, Mexico, Australia, Japan, and Brazil, Netflix must obtain the licensing rights for this song in ***all five countries***. If Netflix cannot obtain the correct licensing rights for even ***one of these countries***, then the easiest way to deal with the problem is to switch the song out for some generic tune that they do have the rights for.

>> For a big act like BTS that definitely has different distribution deals in different markets, getting the licensing rights is probably a big challenge (and expense) and likely not worth it from a business standpoint for Netflix. The result is background music being replaced with generic tunes. 

And in case you were wondering, the music problem is not limited to kdrama content, see this [Vox](https://www.vox.com/2014/11/3/7145231/shows-not-on-dvd-music-rights-wonder-years-wkrp) article explaining how music licensing rights are a huge headache for older shows now being released on streaming platforms.

**Known Alterations to Kdramas on Netflix**

We have a list compiled from feedback by our community about the type(s) of changes that were made to specific kdramas as they were broadcast on Netflix versus original SK broadcast. Subtitle issues are ***not*** included. This list is provided for reference and has not been verified in any manner. If you wish to add anything to the list, please leave a comment or send a [modmail](https://reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/KDRAMA) with the subject: Netflix FAQ.

1opt3g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1opt3g2/first_two_days_on_lisdexamfetamine/,First Two Days on Lisdexamfetamine!,"I was diagnosed with combined ADHD around a month ago. I was in two minds about medication and started titration two days ago. When medicated, I feel like a completely different person. I can see this improving almost every aspect of my life!

I’ve been making notes of my experience so far, using Chat GPT to provide a summary to friends, family and for future medical appointments and I thought I’d share them below:


My First Three Days on Elvanse 30 mg

Why I’m taking it

I began Elvanse (lisdexamfetamine) to manage ADHD (combined inattentive + hyperactive type).
This is my first ADHD medication, so I’ve been recording how it affects focus, mood, sleep, and daily life.

⸻

What’s changed

1. Mental clarity and focus
	•	The constant mental “noise” has dropped.
	•	I can choose what to focus on instead of being pulled by distractions.
	•	Tasks like getting ready, driving, and starting work feel smoother.
	•	Even busy environments (shops, family gatherings) feel quieter and easier to process.

2. Emotional balance
	•	Far less anxiety and irritability.
	•	I can stay calm when late, under pressure, or in conflict.
	•	I’m still empathetic, but I don’t feel the chest-tightening guilt that used to make me people-please.
	•	Mood swings are smaller and shorter; I recover quickly from stress.

3. Communication and relationships
	•	Speech is slower, clearer, and more deliberate.
	•	I actually listen—phone calls and meetings feel natural, not forced.
	•	I’m more sociable at work and with family; comfortable moving around, starting small talk, or making phone calls I used to avoid.
	•	More assertive: able to set boundaries or suggest compromises without feeling rude.

4. Motivation and productivity
	•	Natural urge to organise, tidy, and finish things I’d usually procrastinate on.
	•	More helpful and proactive (e.g., researching a printer for an aunt instead of just giving advice).
	•	Evenings are calmer and healthier—less TikTok and gaming, more time relaxing or talking with family.

5. Sensory and cognitive pace
	•	Music sounds richer and clearer, as if a muffler’s been lifted off.
	•	I no longer need loud music or constant background noise; silence feels fine.
	•	Slower media playback now feels right—my mind’s tempo has normalised.

6. Physical effects
	•	Dry mouth, mild headache, occasional muscle ache—manageable and improving.
	•	Heart rate/BP: slightly elevated at peak, normal by afternoon.
	•	Appetite: reduced; I feel hunger but little desire to eat.
	•	Caffeine: cravings gone; no longer rely on tea/coffee to stay alert.
	•	Sleep: hardest adjustment—both nights after dosing I fell asleep after 12:30 a.m. and woke multiple times, yet woke feeling oddly alert and refreshed.

⸻

When it wears off (around 9 p.m.)
	•	Focus fades; thoughts widen again.
	•	Mood can swing quickly (sad ↔ happy).
	•	Hunger returns, speech feels less fluent, and I think more internally.
	•	The comedown is gentle—no crash, just a slow return to baseline.

⸻

Overall impression after three days
	•	Focus, calm, and confidence have improved enormously.
	•	Anxiety is dramatically lower and more proportional to situations.
	•	Motivation feels natural, not forced.
	•	Side-effects are mild and settling.
	•	Sleep is the main issue to monitor, but daytime energy and clarity are the best they’ve been in years.",1,1762416008.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

The Bengaluru I dream of is calm. Green. Breezy. A city where mornings are soft and slow, where the air smells like rain and leaves and filter coffee. A city where you can walk under trees and hear yourself think. A city that feels like it is holding you not pushing you.   
  
A city where if someone wants to build their life here, they step into the culturenot just the job market. A Bengaluru where Kannada isn’t something people get by without, but something they choose to learn because living here has meaning. 

We are a federal Union, not one giant flat culture.

Karnataka is not just another state, it is a nation of memory, language, land, and people. Compare our population to Germany or France we are in the same range. And those countries protect their languages fiercely, while remaining modern, global, and welcoming. There is nothing backward about protecting who you are t’s how strong cultures survive.

The Bengaluru I dream of is modern, global, and deeply rooted.

Where we have great public transport, restored lakes, tree-lined footpaths, clean neighborhoods, and stable infrastructure. But also where the soul of the city stays intact. Where companies aren’t just headquartered here, but are truly Kannada companies ones that are built here, employ here, and grow here.

I dream of a Bengaluru where people take kannada classes to work in kannada cities in kannada companies, not because they are forced to, but because they want to be part of this place. Because Kannada opens doorsnot just socially, but economically, professionally, emotionally.

just like people learn German to work in German companies in German cities.

A city where progress doesn’t come at the cost of identity.

Where growth is not just measured in buildings and companies, but in belonging.

The Bengaluru I dream of is not afraid to be itself.

It doesn’t dilute itself to please everyone.

It stands tall in its own language, its own memory, its own warmth.

A Bengaluru where the future is built with us, not over us.

A Bengaluru that advances  without forgetting who it is.",2,1762415889.0,bangalore,2,0.67,False

I’ve been exploring ways to make my living room more relaxing — something cozy, stylish, and timeless. That’s when I stumbled upon the [**solid wood rocking arm rest chair**](https://furnisquare.com/products/solid-wood-rocking-arm-rest-chair-for-living-room) from Furnisquare.

But here’s the question: *Is a rocking chair really practical in today’s homes, or is it just an old-fashioned concept?*

After digging around, I realized — this furniture piece is actually making a comeback for a reason.

❓Why Are People Choosing Rocking Arm Chairs Again?

If you think rocking chairs are outdated, think again. The modern versions are beautifully designed — made with **solid Sheesham or Mango wood**, smooth curves, and ergonomic armrests. They fit perfectly in reading corners, living rooms, or even balconies.

People love them because:

* The **rocking motion reduces stress** and promotes relaxation.
* Solid wood gives a **premium, earthy vibe** that pairs with almost any décor.
* It’s **compact yet statement-worthy**, perfect for modern Indian homes.
* You can use it for reading, sipping coffee, or simply unwinding after work.

❓What Makes a Good Rocking Chair Worth the Price?

From what I’ve learned, the key factors to look for are:

✅ **Solid Wood Construction** – Go for hardwoods like Sheesham or Mango for longevity.  
✅ **Comfortable Armrests** – Make sure they support your shoulders and elbows.  
✅ **Smooth Rocking Base** – The balance should be perfect for steady, safe motion.  
✅ **Polish & Finish** – Walnut or honey finishes bring out natural wood grain beautifully.

The one I found on Furnisquare checks all these boxes. The craftsmanship looks impressive, and the price point is lower than similar designs on Pepperfry or WoodenStreet.

❓Why Are Furnisquare Rocking Chairs Gaining Popularity?

I think it’s because they combine **factory-direct pricing** with handcrafted **solid wood furniture** — so you get quality and aesthetics without spending a fortune.

Their [**wooden rocking arm rest chair for living room**](https://furnisquare.com/products/solid-wood-rocking-arm-rest-chair-for-living-room) especially stands out because:

* It’s made from **genuine Sheesham wood**, not engineered substitutes.
* The **hand-polished finish** looks elegant and warm.
* The **rocking design** feels both stable and smooth.
* You can customize the polish or even get matching furniture pieces.

❓Is It Worth Adding a Rocking Chair to Your Space?

If you want a piece that adds personality, comfort, and a touch of nostalgia — yes, absolutely.

It’s more than a chair; it’s a **relaxation spot** that fits perfectly in a corner yet transforms the entire vibe of a room.

The [**solid wood rocking arm rest chair**](https://furnisquare.com/products/solid-wood-rocking-arm-rest-chair-for-living-room) from Furnisquare blends traditional craftsmanship with modern design — something that’s rare and valuable in today’s fast furniture market.",1,1762414843.0,u_OtherwiseGarage1541,0,1.0,False

1opsrly,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1opsrly/finally_understanding_what_sex_drive_means_at_27/,Finally Understanding What “Sex Drive” Means at 27 After Stopping Birth Control Pills,"
**TL;DR**: Spent a decade thinking I just “wasn’t a sexual person” while on BC. Turns out the pill destroyed my libido and I had no idea. Now off it for 6 months and I finally understand what people mean when they talk about actually wanting sex. If you have low libido and you’re on BC, please keep reading.

-----

I’m writing this specifically for women who think they just have a naturally low sex drive. Because that was me. And I was so, so wrong.

I’m 27F and I stopped taking birth control 6 months ago after being on it since I was 16. For over a decade, I believed I was just “not that interested in sex.” I thought I was maybe asexual, or just wired differently. I loved my husband deeply, but the idea of sex felt like… a chore? An obligation? Something I knew I *should* want but just didn’t.

**I had NO IDEA the pill was doing this to me.**

None. My doctors never mentioned it as a side effect. When I brought up my low libido, I was told “some people just have lower drives” or “stress can do that” or “try scheduling sex to make it feel less pressured.” No one - not one single healthcare provider - ever said “hey, the hormones you’re taking might be causing this.”

**The backstory** (skip if you just want the libido stuff): Got diagnosed with PCOS at 16 with all the classic symptoms - hirsutism, cystic acne, elevated testosterone, cysts on my ovaries, extra weight. Started on the combination pill and it helped with the PCOS symptoms through my teens and early twenties.

At 25, horrible cystic acne came back even on anti-androgenic BC. Added 100mg of spironolactone. Skin cleared up beautifully. But then:

- Eczema appeared for the first time ever (neck, mouth, eyes)
- Libido went from low to literally nonexistent
- Sex became painful - dryness, tearing, you name it
- Frequent UTIs
- Complete loss of sensation. Like that entire area of my body was just… turned off

I would actively avoid my husband’s touch. Not because I didn’t love him - I loved him desperately. But physical affection felt like it might lead somewhere I didn’t want to go. I’d tense up when he’d kiss me for too long. I’d find excuses to go to bed after him. I felt guilty constantly, broken, like I was failing as a wife.

I thought this was just WHO I WAS.

I’d been on hormonal birth control my entire adult sexual life. I didn’t have a “before” to compare it to. This was my normal. I genuinely thought some people just don’t like sex that much, and I was one of them.

My husband never pressured me - I need to be super clear about that. But I could see it hurt him. And it hurt me to hurt him. I was 26 years old and had never experienced what it felt like to actually want sex. To initiate it. To feel desire. And I didn’t even know that was something I was missing.

So I stopped. Not for my husband, but for myself. I wanted to know what MY sexuality felt like without synthetic hormones controlling it.

**What happened after I stopped:**

**Months 1-2**: Nothing major. Libido still gone. Felt a bit clearer mentally but that’s it.

**Months 3-4**:

This is when everything changed.

My libido came back and I didn’t know what hit me. I started thinking about sex spontaneously. I’d see my husband doing something mundane like making coffee and just… want him. I’d initiate. I’d touch him just to touch him, not because I felt obligated.

And the first time I had sex and actually felt AROUSED - not just going through the motions but actually wanting it, being wet without lube, feeling sensation return to my body - I cried afterward. I cried because I was happy, but also because I was mourning all of the experiences I’ve missed out on over the years. 

**Months 5-6**:

Libido is still going strong. I’m more affectionate, more present in my relationship, more confident in my body. I feel like I finally understand what everyone’s been talking about my whole adult life.

**Now for the stuff that’s NOT great** (because I want to be honest):

- I’m an oil factory now. Hair needs washing daily. Skin is constantly shiny.
- Hormonal acne on my back, chest and chin/jaw (cystic and painful). Managing with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid but it’s not fun.
- My PCOS symptoms are obviously going to be something I monitor long-term but losing weight has probably helped over the years 

**Even with the acne, even knowing my PCOS might get worse, even dealing with the oily skin and the breakouts - it’s worth it. And it’s getting better every day!**

If you’re reading this and you:

- Have low/no libido and you’re on hormonal birth control
- Think you’re just “not that into sex”
- Feel guilty about not wanting your partner
- Experience dryness, pain, or lack of sensation during sex
- Have never known what your sex drive is like OFF birth control

**Please, please consider that it might not be you. It might be the pill.**

I’m not saying everyone should stop taking BC. I’m not saying it affects everyone this way. Birth control is an important tool and for many people, the benefits outweigh everything else. But you deserve to know this is a possibility. You deserve to make an informed choice.

I spent 11 years thinking something was fundamentally wrong with me. Turns out, my body was just trying to function under a constant stream of synthetic hormones that were suppressing a huge part of who I am.

You deserve to know what YOUR body feels like. What YOUR libido is. What YOUR sexuality looks like without interference. You deserve to make that choice from a place of knowledge, not from a place of accepting that this is just how you are.

If even one person reads this and realizes they’re not broken, that it might be their birth control, then writing this was worth it.",5,1762414716.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

# First Guy:

I’ve, I’ve spread my wings.

Shannon, I’m antisocial, it seems-

But I don’t care

About gender politics.

I’m gonna kiss you-

Don’t care what they say.

.................................................................................

And we, we can be queer.

My mind- has no such bars.

Because rules- don’t hold me back.

Some rules- deserve to die.

Though this may- not be love,

Let’s make love, and cherish the time.

I’m your first guy-

Let us go out.

............................................................................................

I, I feel the steam-

Your eyes- are dazzling moonbeams.

And I- can smell the envy-

We’re better- than everyone.

I’m the first guy

To love a girl.

I’m your first guy

And I love you.

....................................................................................

I’ve, I’ve spread my wings.

Shannon, I’m antisocial, it seems-

But I don’t care

About gender politics.

I’m gonna kiss you-

Don’t care what they say.

...............................................................................

It, it was December (I remember)-

My birthday, you remembered (lovers forever),

And the mistletoe- grew over our heads (our first kiss),

And we kissed, and blocked out the world (nothing matters),

Validation- was secured for me.

We were champions- of the world.

I was the first guy- to love a girl.

I was the first guy.

We were the first guys.

I was the first guy,

To love a girl.

We were the first guys.

....................................................................................................

It’s nothing- I have no fear-

Our love is precious- they don’t get it.

Love is a game- it’s time to play.

Oh-oh-oh-ohh, Oh-oh-oh-ohh, 

It’s time to play.

# 2. Chameleon:

I am a chameleon-

Here to show you different

Versions of myself tonight.

You are my partner

In my fight against life.

I cannot love, I’ve got

Engine precision but no heart.

I’m made of glass,

I have no colour, I’m a blank space

Watching love go on.

I can act- forever Jay Gatsby,

Always playing the part.

Here am I,

Ruled by power and pleasure

To make my life better.

......................................................................................

I am a chameleon,

I better love life ‘till I die.

I am a chameleon,

Who am I without fun?

I am a chameleon,

Watching the world burn.

...........................................................................................................................

Beauty is detachment, but

When will I find meaning?

And who will connect me to the world?

Shannon, you’re so innocent!

A bitter sorrow it cannot work-

Not a surprise I fail at love-

I don’t feel bad, I just can’t love.

................................................................................................................

Loving an alien

Cannot happen in this world-

There is no retaliation.

There is no redemption.

There is no compassion.

There is only the chameleon.

..................................................................................................................

I want you know-

You love a ghost,

But then the chips will fall

And I’ll be hunted.

There is no retaliation.

There is no redemption.

There is no compassion.

There is only the chameleon.

....................................................................

Loving an alien

But then the chips will fall

And I’ll be hunted.

There is no retaliation.

........................................................................................................

Does your face glisten with sorrow?

I don’t have the heart for this.

There is no retaliation.

There is no redemption.

There is no compassion.

There is only the chameleon.

# Dream Factory:

I met a girl,

Since Shannon has gone.

She’s sorely in love with me-

I wish I could say the same.

Basking in fake nostalgia,

She fell in love with a dream factory-

Nothing I say is real.

...............................................................

I’d like to say I’m one person,

But inside I’m a million pieces-

Cogs turning ‘round-

I don’t know who I am.

.............................................................................

Though you try to love me-

You give me hugs and a home.

Yet I’m growing dissatisfied-

Black is eroding the white.

And I’m alone at the top.

........................................................................

It’s Beauty and the Beast-

What would you think?

I only want your comfort-

But I’m an emotionless husk.

You’d think I’m evil and cruel,

If you ever knew the truth-

Because society’s drummed in that thought.

..................................................................

I’m going for beer again,

To make myself feel again.

I’m sorry about my lust-

That the bottle comes between us.

But I can’t love you,

And I really want to love you.

...........................................................................

I’m a dream factory for you-

Making Disney illusions for you.

I’m a dream factory for me-

Dreaming I could feel deep.

I almost love you.

I almost love you.

# Colourblind:

I go through life like a dream-

Emotionally colourblind unlike you.

Learning to read people like a book-

That’s really all I can do.

Our love is golden

Until it’s lost-

The facade melts and the charm rots,

The good guy is gone.

My eyes are gleaming-

Control is fleeting.

Gotta fill my empty space.

..............................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

We’ll put each other out soon.

You try to bring me back alive- 

But baby, I’m dead inside.

I’ve got a different mind-

I’m colourblind.

.........................................................................................

I don’t want to hurt you-

Lily, you’ve always walked with me.

Your dark hazel eyes break stone and ice-

If I can’t love you, I can’t feel at all.

Do you see my psychopathy,

And think I’m rottenly sweet?

I keep trying to be someone worth loving-

Cold and sweet like iced tea.

............................................................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

We’ll put each other out soon.

You try to bring me back alive- 

But baby, I’m dead inside.

I’ve got a different mind-

I’m colourblind.

.....................................................................................

I wouldn’t miss you

If you left me for a guy-

That’s the worst part of it all.

I don’t attach, I disengage-

This is the closest I feel to remorse.

Different mind,

I’m colourblind.

Different mind,

Colourblind, colourblind.

......................................................................................................

Not bad, not good-

Just have different eyes to you.

I’m cold, you’re warm-

We’ll put each other out soon.

You try to bring me back alive- 

But baby, I’m dead inside.

I’ve got a different mind-

I’m colourblind.

# Man Like Me:

Got so many people, yet I feel so alone.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I see Dominic and I feel light in the head.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I’m still with Lily but I just can’t help myself.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I know it’ll break her but I’m struggling to care.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

.............................................................................

I know I don’t have a heart.

I know that this isn’t smart.

I know this will destroy our world.

But I’m throwing caution to the wind.

............................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

........................................................................................................

Your dark chocolate eyes are full of bitter hope-

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

And I’m starting to break down from it.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

You’re a good person and you saved me from my dad.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

The ultimate betrayal is turning love into hate.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

...................................................................................

And I have to tell you what I did.

I can’t let it burn in my internal abyss.

But it won’t hurt you more than I just did.

I’m too far gone, but Lily, you aren’t.

..............................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

.......................................................................................

I sit you down with a cup of tea.

Time to come out and say I’m gay.

You know full well our love must end.

But you want to be friends ‘till the end.

I’m sorry you were ever with this man.

I don’t believe in hell, but I’ll be damned.

I never thought you’d be friends with me.

Lily, you were always something else.

..........................................................................................

I’m dead inside-

Sorry you’re with a man like me.

Man like me.

I’m starting to think

Something’s wrong with me.

Do I want to do this?

.................................................................................................

Making lemonade-

Sorry you were with a man like me.

Man like me.

Now I’m with Dominic,

At least I’ll treat him right-

I want to try.

# Close To Love:

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

............................................................................................

I’ve been sleeping with my man.

When things are old

They’re never bad.

Now I know what to do.

I delight in being exotic.

The only gay lovers around here.

Hey, Dominic-

You make a real woman out of me.

......................................................................................................

I have broken many hearts.

Entered new waters and left blood.

I’m going to hell

For being such a villain.

But you, dear, give me hope

That in darkness, there is light.

To treat you well,

I’ll try with all my might.

.................................................................

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

......................................................................................................

I have run away from home.

I can breathe and strip men to the bone.

Never thought I’d finally be happy.

He helped me bite through the bile.

So I could make this worthwhile.

Take me to your bedroom, Dominic.

...................................................................................................

Oh, I’ll set me free tonight.

Oh, I’ll treat a man right.

Oh, will you give me a chance-

I’ll show you something

Close to love.

I will give you

Something close to love.

......................................................................................

Take a chance and ride.

Ride me, cowboy.

Close to love.

Yes, yes, yes.

# Pointless Loving You:

Pointless loving you.

.........................................

I’ve spent my thoughts on you.

I live a continent apart from you.

And this is what you do?

I’ve stopped chewing the past-

I gave everything I had to love you.

And you leave me in the land of ghosts?

..................................................................

Leave me in the land of ghosts-

Pointless loving you.

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

I thought you’d save me from myself.

Land of ghosts.

........................................................................................

You put Alexis before me.

You tie me to a cross to die.

I thought you’d save me from sin.

I can’t help it when I give in.

I’m a ghost and you strip me of body,

And send me back to my empty space.

................................................................................

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

It’s my fault, I killed you.

Leave me in the land of ghosts.

It’s your fault, your infidelity.

Leave me in the land of ghosts-

Always fighting the black hole

Before it eats me.

Land of ghosts.

I want you.

Land of ghosts.

Land of ghosts.

# Land Of Ghosts:

I’m growing tired

But I’m always hungry.

I’m a liar

But also a truth-seeker.

So many who love me,

But I’m forever deaf to their calls.

I can live with it,

But I’ll die without it too.

.............................................................................

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Leave the land of ghosts.

I can see, what I need to be,

Even if it’s foreign to me.

But I want to try

And leave the land of ghosts.

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

..........................................................................

It’s tricky,

But I’m the trickster.

Learn to give

But I am the giver.

I made many mistakes-

Three people I’ve let down.

High are the stakes,

But I’ll never let you drown.

........................................................................

I don’t care (set me free)

What Dominic says (set me free).

I can make it someday-

I’ve got the tools,

To leave the land of ghosts.

...................................................................................................

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Leave the land of ghosts.

I can see, what I need to be,

Even if it’s foreign to me.

But I want to try

And leave the land of ghosts.

Oh, woah, la, la, la.

Oh, woah, la, la, ooh,

I can see-

And leave the land of ghosts.

# Made In Hell:

Talked about Russian literature

To try and win me over.

I need to take control.

Playing with fire-

I’m a butterfly collector.

We’ll build a glass asylum

And put each other in there.

You’re hanging on my wall.

But I made a mistake again-

I’ll have my head caved in.

...................................................................................................................

Rahma, I’ve got to settle my score-

You can’t keep your paws to yourself.

You’ve gone and hurt me.

You’ve gone and hurt my friend.

I want something to save me.

Make it a godsend.

I have to get over you.

Match made in hell.

Made in hell.

................................................................................

I know I’m a human

With a human need for company.

I can do something better

And spread my devil wings.

.............................................................................................

Rahma, I’ve got to settle my score-

You can’t keep your paws to yourself.

You’ve gone and hurt me.

You’ve gone and hurt my friend.

I want something to save me.

Make it a godsend.

I have to get over you.

Match made in hell.

Made in hell.

...............................................................................................................................................

# Golden Love:

Never thought I’d be looking back

After you left me tied to a track.

You’re Lady Macbeth 

And I’m something more.

You picked the wrong person to fight-

I’m cold to the core.

Three months passed, it’s all good today-

I’m in control of my life again.

You’re not happy that you’re not mine,

Since I left you for someone with a spine.

I never believed in alchemy.

Golden love is an illusion from you-

Lies are painted to look like love.

....................................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

...........................................................................................

I’m one in a million, babe-

Our love was fine

But I still broke the chains.

Desperate to control me,

But I got there before-

Won my life back like a gladiator.

People bet their cash on us,

But we only lasted for three months.

All because of your twisted mind-

Our golden love turns to rust.

You left me with stitches,

In my robot heart.

And I get shouted for being the man-

Women can be oh, so sly.

.........................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

...........................................................................

I’m trying to love, but it’s bloody hard,

When my world isn’t colour-

It’s black and white.

But I got in bed with Edward Hyde-

She left wounds on my ice-cold chest.

..................................................................................

Goodbye golden love.

If only you hadn’t been such a bore.

Goodbye golden love,

Our love could’ve lasted forevermore.

Goodbye golden love-

It was copper anyway.

# Love Is An Action:

Emma and Abbie-

Angels from therapy-

Sawed through the ice

To find a good heart.

For love is an action  
To bring good to our lives.

Lucy deserves my love and time.

.....................................................................................

In every person’s life,

Sacrifices must be made to give life.

Giving up the pleasure of darkness-

I want to bathe in trust and honesty.

# 

# Someone To Trust:

Dream on-

Monsters are glued under my bed.

My love,

You know I’ll always keep you safe.

I’m lying wounded on a beach-

My last woman shot bullets at me,

And you’re my medic.

Picking me up from the ground,

I want you to know-

..........................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

.............................................................................

This sensation,

Of a woman’s hands warming me-

I forgot what it felt like.

I got used to liking the cold.

Empty place-

Drinking bitter coffee on my own.

You’re the sugar in my drink-

I can finally spread my wings again

And let things go.

............................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

..........................................................................................

You held my hand at the station-

When we’re moving on to greater things,

You stayed by my side.

..........................................................................................

You’re someone to trust,

Someone to love-

Someone who builds people up

And doesn’t break them apart.

You’re all I need and more,

And I’m loyal to you.

Someone to trust,

Someone to love.

# Grace Your Space:

My love is cold, like an ice cream-

Come dine with me.

I made a decision- if I can’t feel love

At least I can try.

Cognitive love- it’s nothing much

But it means something.

Lucy, you’re special-

I want this to work.

........................................................................

Don’t hate me-

We’re one and the same.

Hold my hand, and look at my face-

Nothing will harm you in my space.

You give me the courage to 

Grace your space.

.........................................................................................................

Tired of rocky roads and broken bones-

I want stability.

The narcissist in me likes 

Living in the fast lane.

I don’t want your flower to wither-

Let our candle always burn.

You’ve brought me meaning

I’ve always sought.

...................................................................................................

Don’t hate me-

We’re one and the same.

Hold my hand, and look at my face-

Nothing will harm you in my space.

You give me the courage to

Lucy, keep your heart open-

That’s what makes our love work.

Love is surrender-

Fighting only hurts.

Lucy, keep your heart open-

That’s what makes our love work.

I know you love me-

I will make this work.

.........................................................................................................

I’ll never become a stranger.

I’ve found what I’ve been fighting for.

Thanks to you,

Another day, another global conspiracy on Sky News Australia’s The Insiders..  where every coffee chat somehow turns into the fall of Western civilisation.

This week, Webster University Assistant Professor Ralph Schoellhammer told the panel that there’s a “deafening media silence” around worldwide protests against “the elites.”

“They are significant protests..  we’re talking about 30,000 people in the Netherlands,” he said.

“The best way to prevent pushback from large numbers of people is if they don’t know anything is going on.”

He compared it to the Canadian trucker protests and suggested governments and media are working together to undermine dissent..  mainly by ignoring it.

Context
These protests are real but relatively small-scale..  mostly about farm policies, fuel prices, and pandemic-era regulations.
They’ve been covered in European press, just not with the apocalyptic tone Sky prefers.
The network framed it as proof of a worldwide “people vs. elites” uprising, which might be a stretch… or just another Thursday at Sky News.

Basically, The Insiders once again managed to turn a few thousand angry Dutch farmers into the opening chapter of a dystopian revolution..  because nothing drives ratings like fear that “the elites” are out to get you.",2,1762414140.0,NewsRewind,0,1.0,False

Okay real talk… have you ever received something totally *unexpected* — something free — that ended up meaning *way* more than a pricey gift?  
Like, that one small thing that just *clicked* in your soul and made you think, ""Whoa, I didn’t know I needed this until I had it""?  

I’ve been thinking about that lately, and I’m honestly torn between two feelings:

Like how a free eBook turned into a new hobby… or how a free online course transformed a career.  

The magic of “free” is real, but the meaning behind the gift is what really makes it unforgettable.

1opsgwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1opsgwh/the_heart_is_a_lonely_housekeeper/,The Heart is a Lonely Housekeeper,"Let me be clear. I’m a hotel maid. I’ve spent a decade cleaning up the literal and metaphorical shit left behind by strangers at the Grand Northern Vista Suites, a monument to faded glamour and quiet desperation nestled off a highway that leads to nowhere good. I know the specific, soul-sucking texture of carpet stained with cheap vodka and lower-end hope. I’ve seen things that would make a coroner take notes. You don’t last this long without building a callus over your soul, a thick shell of professional detachment. You see a used needle, you bag it. You find a shit-smeared wall, you get the industrial cleaner. It’s all just… mess. Human mess. 

But lately, the mess has changed. It’s become less human. And the callus is being flayed away, layer by layer, by something that doesn’t follow the rules of biology or decency. 

It started, as these things often do, not with a bang, but with a clog. Room 314. 

Mr. Albright, according to the ledger. A corporate guy, the kind whose soul has been vacuum-sealed into a mid-range suit. He checked out, but he’d left the shower running on a scalding, volcanic setting. The room was a tropical hell, condensation dripping from the ceiling, the air so thick with steam you could almost chew it. On the mirror, he’d finger-written a message in the fog: DON’T LET IT DRY. 

“Asshole,” I muttered to the empty room, wiping the words away with my sleeve. Performance art for the help. Whatever. 

The drain was backed up, water pooling around my sneakers. I got my trusty wire hanger—the unsung, unbendable hero of housekeeping—and knelt, my knees popping in protest. I jabbed and prodded, hooking onto something stubborn. It took both hands and a grunt of effort to pull it free. What emerged wasn’t a clump of hair. It was a thick, ropy strand of something that looked like meaty licorice, black and glistening. It was unnaturally warm, almost body-temperature. And it was pulsing. A slow, weak, but undeniable rhythm thrummed through it into my gloved hand. As I watched, horrified and mesmerized, a thin, rust-colored fluid began to weep from its severed end, dripping onto the white porcelain of the tub. The smell was metallic and organic, like the scent of a garden after you’ve tilled up earthworms, but wrong, laced with the tang of old blood. 

Worse were the smaller, thread-like filaments that branched from the main strand. They didn’t just lie there; they twitched and curled slowly in the humid air, blindly seeking, like the legs of a dying insect or the roots of a plant searching for soil. I dropped the squirming thing into my plastic trash bag, my heart hammering against my ribs. I bleached the tub, the tiles, the hanger, my hands, until the chemical burn of the cleaner overwhelmed every other sense. I told myself it was a prank, a bizarre medical condition, a new kind of parasite. Anything but what it felt like: something alive and deeply unwell putting down roots in a place where nothing should grow. That was Anomaly One. A fucking seed of dread, planted right there in the plumbing. 

Anomaly Two was the family in 512. The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was a permanent fixture on their door for seventy-two hours straight. When management finally gave me the key, the first thing that hit me was the cold. The AC was cranked to arctic, a dry, bone-deep chill that the shoddy HVAC system was never designed to produce. 

The room was immaculate. Not clean. Sterile. It smelled of nothing. Not lemon-fresh, not floral, just a void where scent should be. It was more unsettling than any mess. The beds were made with a terrifying, military-grade precision, the corners so sharp you could cut yourself. There were no personal effects. No luggage, no toiletries, not a single crumb. 

And on the nightstand, centered with geometric perfection, was their little art project. 

A pyramid, about three inches high, constructed from what had to be hundreds of human fingernail clippings. They weren't casually glued; they were fused, meticulously layered and bonded by a dark, amber-colored resin that had hardened to a glass-like shine. It was a tiny, monstrous piece of architecture. As I leaned closer, my stomach twisting, I saw that nestled within the latticework of nails were tiny, desiccated insects. Beetles, I think, their carapaces perfectly preserved in the glue. It wasn't a mess. It was an artifact. A relic from a faith I didn't understand. I didn't touch it. I used my dustpan like a forensic tool, sliding the entire structure into a red biohazard bag. The plastic was supposed to be for bloodborne pathogens. I figured whatever the fuck that thing was, it qualified. I marked the slip for incineration. The knot in my stomach tightened. 

The ""International Association of Unspecified Professionals"" convention was the point where ""weird"" curdled into ""profoundly fucked up."" They didn't look like people. They looked like someone's sketch of people, translated through three different languages and then poorly rendered in flesh. They moved through the halls in a silent, synchronized herd, their suits all the same non-descript grey, their handshakes—when offered—a second too long and damply cool. Their skin had a uniform, waxy texture, like high-quality vinyl. 

One of them, listed as ""J. Smith,"" occupied 708. After he checked out, I entered to find the bed made with an aggressive, almost angry precision. The sheets were pulled so taut they seemed to vibrate. But the pillow… the pillow was the problem. 

It held a deep, head-shaped cavity, and nestled within it was a solid quart of clear, odorless gel. It was cold to the touch, a deep, biological chill. At first, I thought it was some kind of expensive hair product, a prank. Then I saw the movement. 

Tiny, semi-transparent shapes drifted and twitched inside the jelly. They were no bigger than grains of rice, larval things with faint, pulsing dots where their eyes might be. One of them, a pale, shrimp-like form, swam slowly to the edge of the gel, pressing its blind head against the membrane from the inside. It formed a tiny, distinct bump against the surface before sinking back into the cloudy depths. The whole mass shuddered with a collective, gelatinous quiver. 

I stumbled back, my hand flying to my mouth. I barely made it to the trash can before I vomited, the acidic taste of my coffee burning my throat. The sound it made when the special disposal team finally bagged it—a soft, wet, sucking plop—echoed in my head for days. The invoice listed it as ""Non-Specified Bio-Gel and Particulate."" The cost was deducted from our department's budget. My boss, a man whose soul was composed of equal parts spreadsheets and resignation, just sighed and said, ""Just… try to use less bleach next time."" The world was bending, and his main concern was profit margins. 

But all of that, every twisted root and fingernail monument and jar of embryonic jelly, was just the warm-up. The prelude. The main event was the Honeymoon Suite. 1211. 

The log said the couple, a ""Mr. and Mrs. Glass,"" had left at 5:13 AM. No fuss, no complaint. When I slid my master key into the lock, the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was thick and cloyingly sweet, the smell of a fruit basket left to rot in a hot car, with hints of sulfur and pennies. 

I pushed the door open. The room was silent. Not quiet. Silent. The kind of silence that feels heavy, absorbing sound. 

They had stripped the king-sized bed bare. Not just the sheets and duvet, but the mattress pad, the pillow protectors, everything. They had then folded each item with an impossible, origami-like precision, stacking them into a perfect, square bundle placed in the exact center of the room. It was a neatness that was itself a form of violence. 

On the bare, stained mattress, all alone, was a single, plump pillow. 

And on that pillow, placed with the chilling, ritualistic care of a mint on a turned-down sheet, was a human heart. 

It wasn't just a heart. It was his heart, I presumed, Mr. Glass's. And it was pristine. It looked like it had been cleaned, polished, almost varnished, a deep, glistening maroon shot through with streaks of creamy yellow fat. It was a perfect anatomical specimen, except for one thing. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, the vena cava—they weren't simply severed. They had been meticulously, surgically braided together into a single, thick, fleshy rope that draped over the side of the pillow and coiled once on the stained mattress like a sleeping snake. There was no blood. Not a drop. The pillowcase was immaculate. The mattress beneath it was stained with the history of a thousand other guests, but this new offering had left no mark. It was the cleanest, most horrific thing I had ever seen. 

I didn't scream. I didn't faint. I am a professional. I simply took a step back, my eyes fixed on the braided vessels, my mind refusing to process the skill, the patience, the utter fucking insanity required to do such a thing. I backed out slowly, pulled the door shut until the latch clicked with a finality that sounded like a tomb sealing, and leaned against the wall, my heart trying to beat its way out of my own, very much unbranded chest. I could still smell that rotten-sweet stench in my nostrils, a perfume from a nightmare. 

I looked down at my hands. They were trembling, a fine, uncontrollable vibration. I am a professional. I have seen it all. But this was something else. I was no longer just cleaning up after people. I was cleaning up after the thing they were becoming, or the thing that was wearing them. 

And as I stood there, trying to remember how to breathe, I heard it. A soft, wet, squelching sound, rhythmic and deliberate, coming from behind the door of Room 1213. I turned my head, my neck cracking with the movement. 

The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door was swinging, gently, back and forth, as if someone had just brushed past it on their way in. Or out.Let me be clear. I’m a hotel maid. I’ve spent a decade cleaning up the literal and metaphorical shit left behind by strangers at the Grand Northern Vista Suites, a monument to faded glamour and quiet desperation nestled off a highway that leads to nowhere good.

It held a deep, head-shaped cavity, and nestled within it was a solid quart of clear, odorless gel. It was cold to the touch, a deep, biological chill. At first, I thought it was some kind of expensive hair product, a prank. Then I saw the movement. 

Tiny, semi-transparent shapes drifted and twitched inside the jelly. They were no bigger than grains of rice, larval things with faint, pulsing dots where their eyes might be. One of them, a pale, shrimp-like form, swam slowly to the edge of the gel, pressing its blind head against the membrane from the inside. It formed a tiny, distinct bump against the surface before sinking back into the cloudy depths. The whole mass shuddered with a collective, gelatinous quiver. 

I stumbled back, my hand flying to my mouth. I barely made it to the trash can before I vomited, the acidic taste of my coffee burning my throat. The sound it made when the special disposal team finally bagged it—a soft, wet, sucking plop—echoed in my head for days. The invoice listed it as ""Non-Specified Bio-Gel and Particulate."" The cost was deducted from our department's budget. My boss, a man whose soul was composed of equal parts spreadsheets and resignation, just sighed and said, ""Just… try to use less bleach next time."" The world was bending, and his main concern was profit margins. 

But all of that, every twisted root and fingernail monument and jar of embryonic jelly, was just the warm-up. The prelude. The main event was the Honeymoon Suite. 1211. 

The log said the couple, a ""Mr. and Mrs. Glass,"" had left at 5:13 AM. No fuss, no complaint. When I slid my master key into the lock, the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was thick and cloyingly sweet, the smell of a fruit basket left to rot in a hot car, with hints of sulfur and pennies. 

I pushed the door open. The room was silent. Not quiet. Silent. The kind of silence that feels heavy, absorbing sound. 

They had stripped the king-sized bed bare. Not just the sheets and duvet, but the mattress pad, the pillow protectors, everything. They had then folded each item with an impossible, origami-like precision, stacking them into a perfect, square bundle placed in the exact center of the room. It was a neatness that was itself a form of violence. 

On the bare, stained mattress, all alone, was a single, plump pillow. 

And on that pillow, placed with the chilling, ritualistic care of a mint on a turned-down sheet, was a human heart. 

It wasn't just a heart. It was his heart, I presumed, Mr. Glass's. And it was pristine. It looked like it had been cleaned, polished, almost varnished, a deep, glistening maroon shot through with streaks of creamy yellow fat. It was a perfect anatomical specimen, except for one thing. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, the vena cava—they weren't simply severed. They had been meticulously, surgically braided together into a single, thick, fleshy rope that draped over the side of the pillow and coiled once on the stained mattress like a sleeping snake. There was no blood. Not a drop. The pillowcase was immaculate. The mattress beneath it was stained with the history of a thousand other guests, but this new offering had left no mark. It was the cleanest, most horrific thing I had ever seen. 

I didn't scream. I didn't faint. I am a professional. I simply took a step back, my eyes fixed on the braided vessels, my mind refusing to process the skill, the patience, the utter fucking insanity required to do such a thing. I backed out slowly, pulled the door shut until the latch clicked with a finality that sounded like a tomb sealing, and leaned against the wall, my heart trying to beat its way out of my own, very much unbranded chest. I could still smell that rotten-sweet stench in my nostrils, a perfume from a nightmare. 

I looked down at my hands. They were trembling, a fine, uncontrollable vibration. I am a professional. I have seen it all. But this was something else. I was no longer just cleaning up after people. I was cleaning up after the thing they were becoming, or the thing that was wearing them. 

And as I stood there, trying to remember how to breathe, I heard it. A soft, wet, squelching sound, rhythmic and deliberate, coming from behind the door of Room 1213. I turned my head, my neck cracking with the movement. 

The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door was swinging, gently, back and forth, as if someone had just brushed past it on their way in. Or out.",5,1762413573.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Coffee isn’t just about waking up. For many people, it’s comfort, routine, and energy in a cup. But in recent years, scientists and mental health experts have started asking a deeper question — *can coffee actually help with depression?*

Millions of people around the world struggle with low mood or depression. And interestingly, studies show that coffee drinkers often report feeling more alert, happier, and motivated compared to non-coffee drinkers.

So, is there really a mental health benefit hiding in your daily cup of coffee? Let’s find out in simple, easy words.

# Section 1: What Happens in Your Brain When You Drink Coffee

When you drink coffee, caffeine — the main active ingredient — travels quickly to your brain. There, it blocks a chemical called **adenosine**, which normally makes you feel tired.  
By blocking it, caffeine boosts other chemicals like **dopamine** and **serotonin**, which are known as the “feel-good” messengers in your brain.

# In Simple Terms:

Coffee doesn’t *cure* depression, but it can temporarily lift your mood, improve focus, and reduce fatigue.

# Expert Opinion:

>

# Quick Table: How Coffee Affects Your Brain

|**Effect**|**What It Means**|**How It Helps**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Blocks adenosine|Less tiredness|You feel more awake|
|Boosts dopamine|Improves mood|You feel happier|
|Increases serotonin|Emotional balance|You feel calmer|
|Enhances focus|Better attention|You stay productive|

# Section 2: What Research Says About Coffee and Depression

# Statistical Insights:

* A large review of **over 300,000 participants** found that people who drink **2–3 cups of coffee daily** have a **15–20% lower risk of depression** compared to non-drinkers.
* Another study from **Harvard School of Public Health** found that **women** who drank **four or more cups daily** had a **20% lower risk** of developing depression.
* According to the **National Coffee Association**, about **64% of adults** in the U.S. drink coffee every day — meaning millions could be benefiting mentally without even realizing it.

# Why This Matters:

Depression is complex — it’s influenced by biology, environment, stress, and lifestyle. Coffee alone can’t solve it, but research shows it may play a small positive role in improving emotional well-being.

# Section 3: How Coffee Can Support Mental Well-being

# 1. Coffee Improves Energy and Motivation

When you’re feeling low, fatigue often makes it hard to do anything. Coffee gives a gentle energy lift, helping you start your day or complete small tasks — both important steps in fighting depression.

# 2. Coffee Can Boost Social Interaction

Coffee often brings people together. Whether it’s chatting with a friend at a café or joining coworkers for a quick break, these small social moments help ease loneliness — a common symptom of depression.

# 3. Coffee Contains Brain-Protective Compounds

Coffee is rich in **antioxidants**, especially **chlorogenic acid**, which helps protect brain cells from damage. Research suggests antioxidants play a role in supporting mental health by reducing inflammation in the brain.

# 4. Coffee May Support Healthy Sleep–Wake Cycles

Surprisingly, when consumed at the right time (morning to early afternoon), coffee helps regulate your natural rhythm. Good timing prevents tiredness during the day and supports better sleep at night.

# Section 4: The Right Way to Use Coffee for Mental Health

Drinking coffee can be helpful, but balance is key. Too much caffeine can cause anxiety, poor sleep, or restlessness — all of which can worsen mood over time.

Here’s how to enjoy coffee safely and mindfully.

# Recommended Daily Limit:

Most experts agree that **300–400 mg of caffeine per day** (about **2–3 cups of coffee**) is safe for most adults.

# Tips for Healthier Coffee Habits:

* **Drink coffee in the morning**, not late at night.
* **Avoid too much sugar or cream**, as they can cause energy crashes.
* **Stay hydrated** — drink a glass of water with every cup.
* **Eat balanced meals**, since coffee alone can’t replace nutrition.
* **Take breaks** if you feel jittery or anxious.

# Table: How Much Coffee Is Too Much?

|**Cups per Day**|**Caffeine Level**|**Effect on Mood**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1–2 cups|Moderate|Boosts energy, calm focus|
|3–4 cups|High|Increased alertness, mild anxiety in some|
|5+ cups|Too high|Possible irritability or insomnia|

2. **Caffeine enters bloodstream →**
3. **Blocks adenosine →**
4. **Increases dopamine & serotonin →**
5. **Improved alertness, focus, and mood**

*(Visual concept: A simple flowchart of how coffee supports the brain’s chemistry in mood balance.)*

# Section 5: When Coffee Might Not Help

While most people benefit from moderate coffee intake, some may feel worse if they’re sensitive to caffeine or have anxiety issues.

# If You Experience:

* Rapid heartbeat
* Nervousness or shaking
* Trouble sleeping
* Irritability

Then it’s best to cut down to 1 cup per day or switch to **decaf** (which still has antioxidants but little caffeine).

# Section 6: The Emotional Side of Coffee

Beyond caffeine and chemicals, there’s something deeply emotional about coffee.  
That warm cup in your hands can symbolize comfort, connection, and calm — all small but real boosts to mental well-being.

Many people find their morning coffee routine helps create stability and mindfulness, especially when life feels unpredictable.

# Simple Mental Health Routine with Coffee:

* Wake up, stretch for 5 minutes.
* Brew a fresh cup slowly, focusing on aroma and sound.
* Sit quietly and take 3 deep breaths before your first sip.
* Reflect on one positive thing about your day.

This simple practice can turn coffee from a habit into a healing ritual.

#  Coffee Can Support, But Not Replace Care

Coffee can indeed improve alertness, lift your mood, and support emotional well-being — especially when enjoyed in moderation. But it’s not a cure for depression.  
If you or someone you know struggles with serious depressive symptoms, professional support is always the best choice.

Your daily cup of coffee can be a small but meaningful part of your mental health toolkit — a moment of warmth, focus, and positivity in your day.

I have always had preground coffee. Recently I switched to getting it ground at the coffee shop/supermarket. 250g grounds last me up to 1-2 weeks. Thinking of moving on to grinding at home because the freshness of grounds die within 3-4 days.  
  
I also have French press and AeroPress but my primary use is going to be moka as I prefer having a concentrated shot.

Suggest me a good budget grinder for under 6k. I tried a [blade grinder ](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08M6B1M3P)because I read that it might be all you need for moka. But it was absolutely terrible.

Now I have shortlisted these ones:

1. InstaCuppa Ceramic Conical Burr for 1.2k
2. InstaCuppa Stainless Steel Conical Burr for 3k
3. Timemore Chestnut C2 for 4.7k

1. 1zpresso Q Air for 6k
2. MHW-3BOMBER Adder V3 for 7k

Outside, the industrial expanse of the Cevos Shipyard was layered in fresh snow, the air thick with the smell of freezing metal and recycled oxygen. Inside, the cramped room was warm, filled with the low hum of heating vents and the smell of stale coffee.

Kalli Mevez, a young woman in her 20's with blonde hair, peach skin & blue eyes, leaned against a dented locker, her light blue top concealed beneath a heavy, oil-stained shipyard jacket that did an admirable job of hiding the twin hilts clipped to her belt. Her partner, Dax Lioone, a young man in his 20's with short black hair, brown skin & brown eyes. He sat at a scratched laminate table, nursing a steaming mug. Both worked hard to look like weary, blue-collar workers, just two more faces ground down by the Imperial machine.

They weren't alone. Three other shipyard employees, Anya, an older mechanic; Torvin, a crane operator; and Avan, a new, nervous recruit, were gathered, the conversation having drifted to the same bitter subject it always did: the Empire.

""They treat us like droids,"" Torvin grumbled, rubbing his gloved hands together. ""The quotas are impossible, the pay is worthless. My father worked in this yard under the Republic for fifty years, and he never saw this kind of slave labor.""

""We're all just cogs now,"" Anya agreed, her voice raspy. ""Used to be, the Senators back on Coruscant at least pretended they cared. Now? It’s just Star Destroyers and Stormtroopers. Things were better before.""

Avan shook his head, bitterness tightening his features. ""And who’s to blame for it? The people who were supposed to protect us. The Jedi. They had the power to stop this, and they were too blind. They let Vader rise, and now we have those freaks, the Inquisitors, burning villages just because someone looked at them wrong.""

Dax shot a quick, subtle glance at Kalli. He kept his tone neutral, leaning into his role as a grounded engineer. ""It happened so fast, didn't it? The Clone Wars ended, and boom. Empire. Maybe the Jedi just ran out of luck.""

Anya scoffed. ""Or they were arrogant. Too big for their boots.""

""I heard that Maul guy is still out there as well,"" Torvin muttered, stirring his caf. ""Talk about a bad omen. Seems like the dark side never runs out of boogeymen.""

Kalli pushed off the locker, folding her arms across her chest. Her smile was sweet, but her blue eyes held a deep, unexpected sadness. She knew the truth of their downfall better than anyone, and she knew the conversation needed a careful steer.

""I think you’re right about the arrogance, Anya,"" Kalli said quietly, her voice measured. ""The enemy was right in front of the Jedi for years. The problem wasn't power; it was egotism. It was a massive pride that stopped them from seeing a threat they didn't believe could touch them.""

She fixed her gaze on Torvin. ""They didn't believe Master Jinn when he tried to warn them about Maul. Not until Maul killed Jinn. Then Dooku, Ventress, Grievous, all the rest, they just kept following suit. The Jedi were too comfortable on their high tower to look down and see the foundation crumbling.""

She paused, offering a wry shrug. ""We all pay the price for it now.""
A bell rang sharply, signaling the end of the break. The workers rose slowly, pulling their hoods up and heading back out into the cold yard, the bitter discussion having done nothing to warm them. Kalli and Dax exchanged a significant look, a reminder that they were not like the others. Their price was far higher, resting on the fact that a six-year-old girl named Piper was currently in a school classroom just a few miles away.

In the shipyard office, Kalli and Dax were back at their workstations, the mundane clatter of tools masking the tension that had settled between them. Kalli was the first to sense it, a chilling vibration in the Force, a signature of malice and scrutiny descending upon Siota.

A shadow crossed the frosted window of the office. Kalli barely moved her lips.
""Inquisitors,"" she whispered to Dax, her eyes fixed on the distant sky through the grimy glass.

Dax leaned in, his voice a low breath. ""Can they sense you?""

""No. They’re barely taught in the Dark Side, more like blunt instruments than true Sith,"" Kalli whispered back, her usual bubbly demeanor completely gone. ""But I'm not taking them lightly. They're dangerous.""

Dax checked the chronometer on his wrist. ""Piper's school lets out in an hour.""

""Let's go,"" Kalli decided instantly, setting down her datapad.

As the couple made for the main door, the Shipyard Officer, a stocky Human male with an Imperial insignia patch, blocked their path. ""Where are you two going?""

Dax stepped forward, projecting concern. ""Our daughter is about to be out of school. We need to go pick her up.""

The Officer glanced at the distant ships descending through the atmosphere. ""Security measures are tightening. Only one of you may leave. Work continues.""

""I'll be fine here,"" Kalli offered quickly, giving Dax a meaningful look. ""You go. I'll cover your hours. See you later.""

Dax nodded, playing the part of the slightly annoyed husband. ""Alright."" He pulled Kalli into a quick, firm kiss, a moment of shared strength and unspoken farewell. He spun around and marched out, disappearing toward the speeder pad.

As Dax reached the speeder pad, his heart was hammering against his ribs. He piloted the civilian speeder toward the school with practiced calm, a father on a routine errand. He picked up Piper, who was chattering about a snowman she had built.

As they flew back toward the hill overlooking Cevos, Dax glanced over his shoulder. Three Imperial Cruisers were now descending rapidly, not toward the military base, but directly toward the shipyard.

Back at the shipyard, one of the ships landed with a blast of snow and heat in the main cargo port. The ramp hissed down, revealing two figures flanked by six intimidating Purge Troopers, four male, two female, all clad in black armor.

The lead Inquisitor, a female Togruta with royal blue skin, spoke in a sharp, cold voice. This was the 14th Sister. ""The output of this shipyard is failing. Your Imperial levy is behind schedule.""

Torvin, fueled by the earlier conversation and the sight of the oppressive Imperial landing, didn't back down. ""Well, you Inquisitors keep killing workers here! What do you expect with a dwindled workforce?""

The second Inquisitor, a pale male Sephi with sharp features, the 15th Brother, didn't hesitate. He thrust out his hand and snatched Torvin off his feet with the Force, suspending him choking in mid-air. ""Do you want to join them, civilian?""

""This is unnecessary,"" a calm voice cut through the tense silence. Kalli Mevez stepped out of the office, her hands visible and empty.

The 14th Sister turned her gaze on Kalli, her expression analytical. ""You weren't here during our last visit.""
""My name is Kalli Mevez. My partner, Dax Lioone, and I moved here six months ago,"" Kalli said smoothly, keeping her posture relaxed.

The 15th Brother lowered Torvin but didn't release him completely, focusing his attention on Kalli. ""And where is your partner?""

The Shipyard Officer, trembling under the intensity of the Dark Side users, piped up nervously. ""H-He's picking up their daughter from the school, Inquisitor.""

Both Inquisitors moved toward Kalli, their shadows stretching long across the bay floor. The 14th Sister circled her slowly. ""A daughter? Now why would you hide such a detail?""

Kalli gave a careless shrug. ""With how many terrible people there are in the galaxy, the best way to keep our daughter safe is to not let a lot of people know we have one.""

The 15th Brother's eyes narrowed, filled with suspicion. ""We don't take kindly to secrets. It makes us wonder what else someone is hiding.""

In a blur of motion, both Inquisitors ignited their double-bladed spinning sabers. The air immediately crackled with malevolent energy.
Kalli didn't flinch. Her hands flew to her hips, drawing her hidden weapons. With two distinct snaps, two pink blades burst to life, bathing the shipyard in a vibrant hue.

The blades clashed in an explosive shower of sparks.
The 14th Sister's voice rose in a triumphant snarl. ""Pink Blades? Only one Jedi in recent memory had that... Kalinda Tosaul!""

The realization was her last. Kalli roared, driving her Force-enhanced strength into the dual clash. She pushed the Inquisitors backward with a powerful surge. As they stumbled, she tapped a discreet button on her right gauntlet. Her cybernetic ""boots"" along her shins and feet glowed faintly blue. She shot forward using integrated jet boots and, utilizing the element of shock and speed, simultaneously cut both Inquisitors in half.

The Purge Troopers immediately opened fire. Kalli deflected the blaster bolts with dizzying speed, using the momentum of her flight to make quick work of the troopers, slicing through armor and blasters until only silence and smoke remained.

A moment later, the deep roar of a departing engine thundered overhead. Dax had piloted their small, discreet cruiser, The Shadow, directly over the shipyard. The rear loading ramp deployed instantly.
Kalli made a running leap, flying up the ramp just as Dax pulled the ship high into the freezing air. She landed lightly, entering the cockpit.

""So,"" Dax said, his face strained from the pressure of the sudden escape, but a familiar smirk playing on his lips. ""You've made a mess.""

Kalli strapped into the co-pilot seat, breathing heavily but completely exhilarated. ""Just another day, babe.""

Dax pulled the ship into a tight turn, clearing Siota's orbit, and with a familiar, stretched visual effect, jumped into Hyperspace.

A small voice echoed from the central hatch. Piper walked in, rubbing her eyes from the sudden burst of light. ""Are we away from the bad guys?""

Kalli immediately unstrapped, rushing to her daughter. She hugged her close, a genuine, relieved smile lighting her face. ""Yeah, sweetheart, we are. We are.""

Kalli walked into the small living room area. Koda the Charhound was asleep on the couch, curled into a fiery ball. She scratched the hound's belly and patted the dome of R8-SPH ""Sophie"" who beeped a cheerful greeting. Then, Kalli slipped into the master bedroom.

""Where are we going?"" Dax called from the cockpit, not taking his eyes off the swirling blue tunnel of Hyperspace.

Kalli exited the bedroom, no longer wearing the heavy shipyard jacket or the restrictive work pants. She was now in a purple shirt and navy blue shorts, completely revealing the black cybernetics that ran from her knees downward. She looked free.

""Anywhere, really,"" she said, leaning against the doorframe, ready for the next adventure.

That transition works perfectly! You established the immediate threat (the Inquisitors) and then immediately delved into the personal, grounded reality of Kalli's life—her family, her injury, and the unique history of her weapons.

The fortress on Nur was a monument to the Emperor's paranoia. Deep within the obsidian walls of the Inquisitorius base, the imposing figure of the Grand Inquisitor stood before a tactical holo-map of the galaxy.

The 12th Sister, her Nautolan head-tails swaying slightly, stood at attention next to the 13th Brother, whose pale face showed a mixture of boredom and focused intensity. The holo-map displayed a chilling image: a recording of the chaotic final seconds at the Siota Shipyard, culminating in the swift, brutal deaths of the 14th and 15th Inquisitors.

The Grand Inquisitor's voice was sharp and devoid of emotion. ""The Mevez-Lioone family. A retired Jedi Knight, Kalinda Tosaul, codenamed 'Kalli.' She has been operating on Siota for six months with her partner and child.""

The 13th Brother scoffed. ""A Jedi living as a dock worker? Pathetic.""

""Pathetic,"" the Grand Inquisitor agreed, ""yet she eliminated two of your colleagues with speed and efficiency. Her cybernetics suggest a serious prior injury, yet she maintains an undeniable connection to the Force. And her signature... it is known.""

He looked directly at the 12th Sister. ""The Emperor demands results. You will cease your current operations and take this priority. Find Jedi Knight Kalli Mevez. Retrieve the child. Deliver the mother to Lord Vader.""

""It will be done,"" the 12th Sister vowed, her purple skin seemingly darker in the ambient light.

""Good. She has the sentimentality of a mother and the audacity of a survivor. Do not underestimate her. Failure is a pain I would personally ensure you do not recover from."" Grand Inquisitor commanded.

The cabin of The Shadow was cozy and dimly lit, the deep hum of the hyperdrive providing a steady backdrop. Kalli sat comfortably on the main couch, leaning back against a pile of pillows. Her two lightsabers rested harmlessly in her lap.

Her lower legs were gone. Dax sat on a chair in front of her, a complex set of tools laid out around him. The black cybernetics were detached, and he was working on the silver, circular devices now visible at the bottom of her thighs, the junction points where the mechanical limbs connected and powered her unique jet propulsion system.

Curled up against Kalli's side, radiating a steady, comfortable heat, was Koda, deep in sleep.

Near the central mess table, Piper was absorbed in her training. She held a practice lightsaber that glowed a gentle yellow, matching her intense focus. She moved fluidly, batting away the harmless strikes of a floating training droid.

""You used a little bit of the fuel reserves in the boosters, but there's still plenty in them,"" Dax noted, tightening a small component with a careful twist.

Kalli ran a thumb over one of her lightsaber hilts. ""My hand was forced. The best way to get out of there was ending it quickly. We can replace the fuel. We can't replace our lives.""

Dax set down a tool and looked up at her. ""I know, but your sabers are a massive target. Anyone who sees those knows you aren't just a survivor. You're a Jedi Knight.""

Kalli smirked. ""Well, I'm not getting rid of them. They’re mine.""

""How did you get stuck with them anyway? Pink isn't exactly a common hue,"" Dax asked, adjusting a small power coupling.

Kalli’s gaze drifted to Piper, a soft fondness in her expression. ""Master Yoda said once that my saber’s color is paired with a Jedi of joy and compassion, a true inner light. The last Jedi to wield the same color was Master Matteo Devereux, a little over three hundred years ago. I think he said Matteo was a bit of a goofball, too."" She chuckled softly.

Dax raised an eyebrow. ""You can't have been the only recent Jedi with joy and compassion, surely.""

""No,"" Kalli conceded. ""But I think choice plays a role. Most Jedi believe their crystals will be either blue or green, and they get it. Master Windu was unique as well. His purple blade was said to be paired with him because of his blend of incredible power and a certain aggression in his fighting style. However, I always sensed some joy whenever he ignited his blade. I think his choice made it unique.""

Piper walked over, turning off her yellow practice saber. She looked down at the exposed connection points on Kalli’s legs. ""Does it still hurt, Mommy?"" she asked quietly, pointing at Kalli's missing limbs.

Kalli wrapped an arm around her daughter and kissed her forehead. ""No, sweetheart. Not really. Sometimes I feel like my legs are still there, trying to wiggle my toes."" Her eyes grew distant for a moment. ""Thankfully, Dooku's armored pawn only got my legs. Masters Aayla and Kit saved me before he could finish the job.""

This story takes place in a remote area of the UK but to protect the people involved I won’t say the exact location.
My friend Zahra, a British Pakistani influencer had just recently had her second child and her husband had gone away on a golf holiday leaving her alone with the two children. She was used to being left alone as her husband often worked away from home too and would often go away on vacation with his friends leaving her alone to take care of the children.

It was a stormy night and there was a lot of thunder so it was noisy. She started to feel uncomfortable as it was getting dark early and her house is fairly isolated so all the noise from outside was getting to her. 
At around 9pm she had just finished a cup of coffee in the kitchen, the children were asleep and Zahra was making sure the house was locked up for the night. She went back into the kitchen and saw that the back door was slightly open. She started to approach it but then felt very dizzy, stumbling and she fainted. 

Zahra slowly regained consciousness and was sat on a chair in the kitchen. The first thing she was aware of was how heavily she was breathing through her nose. She felt something covering her mouth, and after twisting her lips she realised it was duct tape that was sealing her lips. Zahra started to panic and tried to talk and shout but the gag around her mouth was preventing this. She struggled to move as well as she could feel her hands were taped together behind the chair and when she looked down she was duct taped to the chair and her feet were taped together. Her hard breathing popped the duct tape covering her mouth in and out. Then the lamp over her head switched on. Standing there before her was a medium built man with a hood on and a scarf covering his lower face. At this point, Zahra was obviously petrified and was mainly concerned for her two children sleeping upstairs. The man then said “I won’t hurt you but do you keep money in the house?” Zahra mumbled “no” against the tape.

The man had a large bag which he had filled with items such as Dubai jewellery from around the house. The next thing he said sent a chill up Zahra’s back, “don’t worry your kids are still asleep.” He then went to leave through the back kitchen door and before exiting turned and said “I’m sorry for this.” He then left the house leaving Zahra tied up and gagged. Zahra struggled with her bonds, grunting heavily through the tape on her mouth for a few minutes and then eventually freed her mouth from the tape by twisting her mouth and biting the tape. She managed to twist her hands out of the tape holding her wrists. She immediately ran to check on her children who had both slept through the entire ordeal. She phoned the police and the man was eventually apprehended later that week.

As mentioned, Zahra has an online presence so the man was aware of this and was aware that she was often left alone. He admitted to gaining entry to the back door and drugged her coffee which explains why she fainted. The burglar said he had lost his business and was in a desperate situation with the state of the economy but he did not wish to harm anyone. 

Zahra bears a resemblance to Kim Kardashian and the fact she is a micro influencer is likely what gave him this idea as a similar situation happened with Kim Kardashian a few years earlier. The man was aware of her online presence and he knew she was often left alone at home. 
Zahra is a very strong, feisty young woman so she did eventually learn to live with the situation however it’s not something you can ever fully recover from. She couldn’t help feel sorry for the man who did this but the feeling she had when she was gagged and helpless in that chair is something she’ll never forget.

1ops8iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductAmazon/comments/1ops8iy/what_backpacking_stove_should_i_choose_for_solo/,What backpacking stove should I choose for solo hiking?,"Hey everyone!

So I've been solo hiking for about three years now, and I learned the hard way that picking the right backpacking stove makes a huge difference. Let me share what I figured out so you don't have to go through the same trial and error I did.

**Weight is Everything**

When you're hiking alone, every ounce counts. I used to carry this heavy camp stove that worked great but killed my shoulders after mile five. For solo trips, you want something that weighs less than a pound. Canister stoves are usually your best bet here. They're lightweight, compact, and super reliable.

**Fuel Type Matters**

There are basically three options: canister fuel, liquid fuel, and alternative fuel stoves. For most solo hikers, canister stoves win because they're easy to use and you can find fuel at almost any outdoor store. Liquid fuel works better in freezing temps, but honestly, unless you're climbing mountains in winter, stick with canister.

**Boil Time and Efficiency**

When you're tired and hungry after hiking all day, waiting forever for water to boil is annoying. Look for a camping stove that can boil a cup of water in under four minutes. Also, check the fuel efficiency because you don't want to carry extra canisters.

**What I Actually Recommend**

After trying different options, I put together a guide comparing the top portable camping stoves for solo backpackers. You can [check out the best backpacking stoves here](https://athomewave.com/backpacking-stove) where I break down the pros and cons of each one.

**My Current Setup**

I use a simple canister stove with a built-in igniter. Cost me around thirty bucks and it's been going strong for two seasons. It weighs about 3 ounces and fits inside my cook pot. Perfect for boiling water for freeze-dried meals or morning coffee.

**Things to Consider**

Think about what kind of cooking you'll actually do. If you're just rehydrating meals and making instant coffee, you don't need anything fancy. A basic ultralight stove will do the job. But if you want to actually cook rice or simmer soups, you might want something with better flame control.

Also, practice using your stove before your trip. Seriously. I've seen people struggle with their brand new stoves at camp because they never tested them at home.

**Bottom Line**

For most solo hikers, a simple canister stove between $20-$50 is perfect. Don't overthink it.

His 41 year marriage and our family is at stake. How do I get through to him or is it too late?,"I’m living this and experiencing it in first person, in real time. My family and I are in crisis so I hope the mods allow this post. 

TL;DR: 

My 74-year-old dad is having an emotional affair with a widow from his music group. My 69-year-old mom knows, and it’s destroying her. He uses faith to justify it and refuses to cut contact. They’ve started marriage counseling, but the therapist immediately referred them to individual sessions. My mom recently moved into the guest room. I’m their 32-year-old daughter, currently living with them due to a chronic illness and disability, and I’m watching this unfold up close. I don’t know how to support my mom without losing my dad — or whether I should reach out to the other woman’s adult children, who already disapprove of the situation. Is my relationship with my dad salvageable? Will that hurt my mom and I?

⸻

My parents have been married for over 40 years. They raised four of us in a traditional Catholic home — my mom ran the PTA, my dad was our Scout leader, and we took family trips to Disney every year. They were the couple who seemed unshakable.

I’m 32 and currently living with them because a chronic illness has left me physically disabled for now. I’m in therapy and working to regain my independence, but for the time being, this is my reality. I’ve ended up as both witness and emotional support while everything falls apart around me.

Now my dad is having what he calls a “friendship” with a woman from his music hobby group. She’s a widow, and they got close after her husband passed. It’s turned into constant texting, calls, and secret meetups. He even parks away from home to talk to her and turns off his phone location when he’s with her.

This all came to light in June, but we think it started months earlier — possibly while her husband was still alive. That realization has been hard to process. It’s one thing to see emotional boundaries crossed, but knowing it may have begun before she was even widowed makes it feel darker and more deceitful.

He swears nothing physical has happened, but told my mom it’s “either she stays in my life or there’s no marriage.” He says “God understands his heart,” as if that makes it okay. He feels righteous, like this is spiritually justified.

My mom is devastated but still trying to hold on. She checks his location, goes everywhere with him, and says she’s “doing what she can to not lose her marriage.” But last month, she started sleeping in the guest room upstairs. That small change hit me harder than anything — it made the distance between them feel real for the first time.

She’s confronted both of them before. Once, she actually joined them during a four-hour “coffee outing” and talked to the woman face to face. The woman claimed they’re just “friends” who are “growing together in faith.” My mom said she prattled on self-righteously the whole time, as if this spiritual framing somehow made it okay.

When my dad came home from church recently, he told my mom — almost like a child proving a point — that “God is still on my side.” He said he isn’t doing anything wrong and even told her he’d “stolen the woman’s heart.” Then he asked me, “What is your mom really losing by me having this friend?” I couldn’t even find words.

What I can’t stop asking myself is why this random woman has become worth trading a marriage, a family, a reputation, and decades of connection for. How does someone who spent his whole life being faithful, respected, and admired throw it all away for something so hollow?

He still believes he’s entitled to privacy — that as long as “nothing physical happened,” no one has a right to know. He’s convinced this can stay a secret between those involved. I told him, “The truth always comes out.” Sometimes I wonder if putting this out in the open — “on blast” — would be the only way to break through his delusion.

Her adult children and their spouses have already expressed disapproval of the “friendship.” I’m tempted to reach out to them, just to let them know the full picture — but I don’t know if that would help or make things worse.

They’ve agreed to marriage counseling and already had one session, but the therapist referred them both to more experienced individual counselors. Their separate sessions are next week, so right now, we’re just waiting.

Two of my three brothers know, but we haven’t talked about it. Everyone’s quiet — maybe too angry or ashamed to bring it up.

I’m trying to support my mom, but I’m emotionally drained. Every conversation ends in tears or silence. And every time I look at my dad, I see someone I don’t recognize anymore.

Sometimes I just sit with the question: is the man I’ve cherished as my dad still in there?
Will he ever snap out of this, or has something inside him truly changed for good?

And if he doesn’t — if this is who he’s become — how do I ever trust him again?
How do I trust any man again, after watching the best one I knew burn everything down for nothing?

1ops4s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ops4s6/the_heart_is_a_lonely_housekeeper/,The Heart is a Lonely Housekeeper,"Let me be clear. I’m a hotel maid. I’ve spent a decade cleaning up the literal and metaphorical shit left behind by strangers at the Grand Northern Vista Suites, a monument to faded glamour and quiet desperation nestled off a highway that leads to nowhere good. I know the specific, soul-sucking texture of carpet stained with cheap vodka and lower-end hope. I’ve seen things that would make a coroner take notes. You don’t last this long without building a callus over your soul, a thick shell of professional detachment. You see a used needle, you bag it. You find a shit-smeared wall, you get the industrial cleaner. It’s all just… mess. Human mess. 

But lately, the mess has changed. It’s become less human. And the callus is being flayed away, layer by layer, by something that doesn’t follow the rules of biology or decency. 

It started, as these things often do, not with a bang, but with a clog. Room 314. 

Mr. Albright, according to the ledger. A corporate guy, the kind whose soul has been vacuum-sealed into a mid-range suit. He checked out, but he’d left the shower running on a scalding, volcanic setting. The room was a tropical hell, condensation dripping from the ceiling, the air so thick with steam you could almost chew it. On the mirror, he’d finger-written a message in the fog: DON’T LET IT DRY. 

“Asshole,” I muttered to the empty room, wiping the words away with my sleeve. Performance art for the help. Whatever. 

The drain was backed up, water pooling around my sneakers. I got my trusty wire hanger—the unsung, unbendable hero of housekeeping—and knelt, my knees popping in protest. I jabbed and prodded, hooking onto something stubborn. It took both hands and a grunt of effort to pull it free. What emerged wasn’t a clump of hair. It was a thick, ropy strand of something that looked like meaty licorice, black and glistening. It was unnaturally warm, almost body-temperature. And it was pulsing. A slow, weak, but undeniable rhythm thrummed through it into my gloved hand. As I watched, horrified and mesmerized, a thin, rust-colored fluid began to weep from its severed end, dripping onto the white porcelain of the tub. The smell was metallic and organic, like the scent of a garden after you’ve tilled up earthworms, but wrong, laced with the tang of old blood. 

Worse were the smaller, thread-like filaments that branched from the main strand. They didn’t just lie there; they twitched and curled slowly in the humid air, blindly seeking, like the legs of a dying insect or the roots of a plant searching for soil. I dropped the squirming thing into my plastic trash bag, my heart hammering against my ribs. I bleached the tub, the tiles, the hanger, my hands, until the chemical burn of the cleaner overwhelmed every other sense. I told myself it was a prank, a bizarre medical condition, a new kind of parasite. Anything but what it felt like: something alive and deeply unwell putting down roots in a place where nothing should grow. That was Anomaly One. A fucking seed of dread, planted right there in the plumbing. 

Anomaly Two was the family in 512. The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign was a permanent fixture on their door for seventy-two hours straight. When management finally gave me the key, the first thing that hit me was the cold. The AC was cranked to arctic, a dry, bone-deep chill that the shoddy HVAC system was never designed to produce. 

The room was immaculate. Not clean. Sterile. It smelled of nothing. Not lemon-fresh, not floral, just a void where scent should be. It was more unsettling than any mess. The beds were made with a terrifying, military-grade precision, the corners so sharp you could cut yourself. There were no personal effects. No luggage, no toiletries, not a single crumb. 

And on the nightstand, centered with geometric perfection, was their little art project. 

A pyramid, about three inches high, constructed from what had to be hundreds of human fingernail clippings. They weren't casually glued; they were fused, meticulously layered and bonded by a dark, amber-colored resin that had hardened to a glass-like shine. It was a tiny, monstrous piece of architecture. As I leaned closer, my stomach twisting, I saw that nestled within the latticework of nails were tiny, desiccated insects. Beetles, I think, their carapaces perfectly preserved in the glue. It wasn't a mess. It was an artifact. A relic from a faith I didn't understand. I didn't touch it. I used my dustpan like a forensic tool, sliding the entire structure into a red biohazard bag. The plastic was supposed to be for bloodborne pathogens. I figured whatever the fuck that thing was, it qualified. I marked the slip for incineration. The knot in my stomach tightened. 

The ""International Association of Unspecified Professionals"" convention was the point where ""weird"" curdled into ""profoundly fucked up."" They didn't look like people. They looked like someone's sketch of people, translated through three different languages and then poorly rendered in flesh. They moved through the halls in a silent, synchronized herd, their suits all the same non-descript grey, their handshakes—when offered—a second too long and damply cool. Their skin had a uniform, waxy texture, like high-quality vinyl. 

One of them, listed as ""J. Smith,"" occupied 708. After he checked out, I entered to find the bed made with an aggressive, almost angry precision. The sheets were pulled so taut they seemed to vibrate. But the pillow… the pillow was the problem. 

It held a deep, head-shaped cavity, and nestled within it was a solid quart of clear, odorless gel. It was cold to the touch, a deep, biological chill. At first, I thought it was some kind of expensive hair product, a prank. Then I saw the movement. 

Tiny, semi-transparent shapes drifted and twitched inside the jelly. They were no bigger than grains of rice, larval things with faint, pulsing dots where their eyes might be. One of them, a pale, shrimp-like form, swam slowly to the edge of the gel, pressing its blind head against the membrane from the inside. It formed a tiny, distinct bump against the surface before sinking back into the cloudy depths. The whole mass shuddered with a collective, gelatinous quiver. 

I stumbled back, my hand flying to my mouth. I barely made it to the trash can before I vomited, the acidic taste of my coffee burning my throat. The sound it made when the special disposal team finally bagged it—a soft, wet, sucking plop—echoed in my head for days. The invoice listed it as ""Non-Specified Bio-Gel and Particulate."" The cost was deducted from our department's budget. My boss, a man whose soul was composed of equal parts spreadsheets and resignation, just sighed and said, ""Just… try to use less bleach next time."" The world was bending, and his main concern was profit margins. 

But all of that, every twisted root and fingernail monument and jar of embryonic jelly, was just the warm-up. The prelude. The main event was the Honeymoon Suite. 1211. 

The log said the couple, a ""Mr. and Mrs. Glass,"" had left at 5:13 AM. No fuss, no complaint. When I slid my master key into the lock, the first thing that hit me was the smell. It was thick and cloyingly sweet, the smell of a fruit basket left to rot in a hot car, with hints of sulfur and pennies. 

I pushed the door open. The room was silent. Not quiet. Silent. The kind of silence that feels heavy, absorbing sound. 

They had stripped the king-sized bed bare. Not just the sheets and duvet, but the mattress pad, the pillow protectors, everything. They had then folded each item with an impossible, origami-like precision, stacking them into a perfect, square bundle placed in the exact center of the room. It was a neatness that was itself a form of violence. 

On the bare, stained mattress, all alone, was a single, plump pillow. 

And on that pillow, placed with the chilling, ritualistic care of a mint on a turned-down sheet, was a human heart. 

It wasn't just a heart. It was his heart, I presumed, Mr. Glass's. And it was pristine. It looked like it had been cleaned, polished, almost varnished, a deep, glistening maroon shot through with streaks of creamy yellow fat. It was a perfect anatomical specimen, except for one thing. The aorta, the pulmonary artery, the vena cava—they weren't simply severed. They had been meticulously, surgically braided together into a single, thick, fleshy rope that draped over the side of the pillow and coiled once on the stained mattress like a sleeping snake. There was no blood. Not a drop. The pillowcase was immaculate. The mattress beneath it was stained with the history of a thousand other guests, but this new offering had left no mark. It was the cleanest, most horrific thing I had ever seen. 

I didn't scream. I didn't faint. I am a professional. I simply took a step back, my eyes fixed on the braided vessels, my mind refusing to process the skill, the patience, the utter fucking insanity required to do such a thing. I backed out slowly, pulled the door shut until the latch clicked with a finality that sounded like a tomb sealing, and leaned against the wall, my heart trying to beat its way out of my own, very much unbranded chest. I could still smell that rotten-sweet stench in my nostrils, a perfume from a nightmare. 

I looked down at my hands. They were trembling, a fine, uncontrollable vibration. I am a professional. I have seen it all. But this was something else. I was no longer just cleaning up after people. I was cleaning up after the thing they were becoming, or the thing that was wearing them. 

And as I stood there, trying to remember how to breathe, I heard it. A soft, wet, squelching sound, rhythmic and deliberate, coming from behind the door of Room 1213. I turned my head, my neck cracking with the movement. 

The ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door was swinging, gently, back and forth, as if someone had just brushed past it on their way in. Or out.

1ops2va,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ops2va,Presidential Decathlon event: full‑throttle braking from 180 mph — because leadership requires stopping power.,"Carbon Ceramic Brakes — who *really* appreciates them?

Let’s talk about carbon‑ceramic brakes on road cars. Porsche, BMW, Ferrari, McLaren — they all offer them for a reason.

Yes, they’re expensive to spec and even pricier to replace.

But here’s the thing: the benefits go way beyond bragging rights.

1. **Massive weight savings** — less unsprung mass means sharper handling, quicker steering response, and better ride quality.
2. **Consistent performance** — they shrug off heat that would leave traditional rotors gasping. Whether it’s a mountain descent, a track day, or repeated high‑speed stops, CCBs stay rock solid.
3. **Longevity** — for spirited drivers, they can outlast multiple sets of steel rotors. Over years of ownership, that cost gap narrows more than most realize.

Sure, they can be delicate if abused or chipped, and they like to be warm before they bite hard — but modern systems from Porsche, BMW, and others have made huge strides in cold‑weather performance.

The “Cars & Coffee Spec” stereotype misses the point: CCBs aren’t just for showing off. They’re for drivers who value *consistency*, *precision*, and *control* — the confidence of knowing your brakes will perform exactly the same on lap 20 as on lap 2. Even if you’re not chasing lap times, that stability translates into a calmer, more composed road drive.

So who really gets their money’s worth?

* Drivers who do mountain or canyon runs regularly.
* Those who track occasionally but want a dual‑purpose setup.
* Owners planning to keep their car long‑term, who appreciate performance that doesn’t fade.

Every time you brake from triple digits and feel that smooth, unflinching deceleration — that’s where the value is.

Drive safe, enjoy the engineering, and may your rotors stay cool and clean.",2,1762412154.0,Bigbrakekit,0,1.0,False

The book was likely published around 2006, is in landscape orientation with a gray hardcover, and is full-color. It contains multiple sections covering different types of cars, including supercars, luxury cars, SUVs, and concept vehicles, with engine specifications, approximate prices, top speeds, and likely 0–60 mph/s times for each car. Most of the cars featured fall within the 2002–2007 model years. Some of the cars I distinctly remember include the Aston Martin Vanquish S, the concept Aston Martin Rapide (2006), Ford GT, Koenigsegg, Bugatti Veyron, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Mercedes Maybach, and a European-spec Land Rover in right-hand drive. The book is clearly organized, coffee-table style, and likely aimed at teenage and adult car enthusiasts. You’d think that after reading it for so many years I would remember more, but my memory blanks on the title and author. Unfortunately, the school has since closed, so I have no way of checking their records or the edition I used. Additionally I’ve already tried using AI and google to track down the title of this book.

I never thought I’d be here. My parents have been married for over 40 years. I grew up in a stable Catholic home — my mom led the PTA, my dad coached my soccer team, and we took family trips to Disney every year. They were the couple everyone looked up to.

I’m 32 and living with them right now because of a chronic illness that’s left me temporarily disabled. I’m in therapy to regain my independence, but in the meantime, I’m stuck watching this from the front row.

My dad has what he calls a “friendship” with a woman from his music group. She’s a widow, and they got close after her husband passed away. But it’s not friendship — it’s an emotional affair. Constant texts. Long phone calls. Secret meetups. Turning off his phone location.

This all came to light in June, but my mom and I have pieced together enough to believe it started months before — maybe even while the woman’s husband was still alive. That thought makes me sick. My dad used to be the kind of man who’d never blur those lines. I don’t know how to reconcile that with the version of him now.

He even told my mom it’s “either she stays in my life or there’s no marriage.” He swears nothing physical happened, but then says “God understands my heart.” As if that makes it okay. As if faith has become his shield against accountability.

My mom’s devastated. She’s been tracking his location, showing up where he goes, just trying to hang on. Last month, she started sleeping in the guest room upstairs. They’ve shared a bed for over 40 years. That’s when it really sank in — something sacred has cracked.

She even confronted both of them. She showed up during a four-hour “coffee outing” and sat down. The woman acted pious and calm, claiming they’re just “friends growing closer to God.” 

My dad came home from church one day saying, almost smugly, that “God is still on my side.” He told my mom he “stole the woman’s heart.” Then he looked at me and asked, “What is your mom really losing by me having this friend?”

What I can’t stop asking myself is: why is this random woman worth trading everything for?
A marriage. A family. His reputation. His faith. Forty years of connection. Why is she worth burning it all down?

He thinks he’s entitled to privacy — that as long as “nothing physical happened,” no one has the right to judge him. I told him the truth always comes out. Part of me wonders if putting this whole thing on blast would be the only way to wake him up.

They’ve started counseling, but even the therapist looked stunned. He referred them both out for individual sessions. Their new appointments are next week.

I don’t know what happens after that. Two of my three brothers know, but no one talks. The silence feels like mourning.

I’m trying to support my mom, but it’s draining. Every day feels heavier. And every time I look at my dad, I see someone I don’t recognize anymore.

Sometimes I just sit with the questions that keep me up at night:
Is the man I cherished as my dad still in there?
Will he ever snap out of this?
And if he doesn’t… how do I ever trust him again?
How do I trust any man again, after watching the best one I knew burn everything down for nothing?

TL;DR:
My 74-year-old dad is having an emotional affair with a widow from his music group. My 69-year-old mom knows, and it’s destroying her. He uses faith to justify it and refuses to cut contact. They’ve started marriage counseling, but the therapist immediately referred them to individual sessions. My mom recently moved into the guest room. I’m their 32-year-old daughter, currently living with them due to a chronic illness and disability, and I’m watching this unfold up close. I don’t know how to support my mom without losing my dad — or whether I should reach out to the other woman’s adult children, who already disapprove of the situation.",5,1762411784.0,Divorce,4,0.86,False

I could really use some support and some advice from women older than me to tell me I didn’t just totally mess up everything because I am in a really bad place right now mentally and emotionally. 

The last 5 years of my life were just hell for me and something needed to change, so I moved to Stockholm, a childhood dream of mine, to do some soul searching. I always planned on going for a couple of years when I graduated high school but I started dating a guy at 17 who begged me to stay and told me he couldn’t be with me if I moved (I know, I know, I was 18). He basically always told me it was a stupid idea anyways. That relationship lasted 14 years and became incredibly controlling and abusive. I was miserable. When I was 27 I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and during that time I realized I deeply regretted the decision I made to stay with a controlling partner instead of follow my dreams. After I went into remission my high school best friend died by suicide and shortly after I lost my 10 year job as a coffee shop manager and coffee roaster (my passion since I was a teenager) due to Covid taking out all of the local businesses in town. Feeling a new invigoration for wanting to be my own best friend and do what’s best for me I got the courage to leave my long relationship which was the best decision of my life but I found myself in a place without anything that I tied my identity to throughout the 20s. Throughout that whole time I tried to do college (without knowing what I wanted to do in life because I was stuck in this small Missouri town my ex refused to move out of against my constant communication that I was unhappy there and I always really felt motivated to do something cool in my life) but my mental health and self efficacy was so bad during these times that I barely made in through and only ended up receiving a General bachelors degree. Finally though, I started going to therapy and working on myself and decided I could finally take a couple of years to move to Sweden and I finally realized what I wanted to do as a career in life; be a therapist. 

Sounds happy right? Well, I fell in love with a girl (we will call her Sara) in my friend group who just so happened to be moving into my house because honestly it was just a really good option for the both of us financially. I didn’t mean to fall in love with her, nor did she plan to fall in love with me, but it just kind of happened and to be honest the year of living with her was the best year of my life. It was the first time I had loved someone in that way and regardless of our past relationship trauma it was a fulfilling, communicative, and healing relationship because of how well we cared for each other, and how much we loved being around each other. At this point I had already been planning and communicating with her that I planned to move to Sweden, and she communicated that she planned to move somewhere far away for her masters and we both just wanted what was best for each other. 

So, now I’m in Sweden and I was shocked to find out that it totally rocked my whole nervous system. Not only heartbroken and regretful of the decision to not stay behind a second time because of someone I was in love with, but utterly confused and shaken up that I made such a big move. I always lived in the same town, the same house, sound the same job I was passionate about. I know there was nothing left for me in that town, and maybe it’s really just the heartbreak making me feel this way, but I can’t help but feeling I made a mistake. I have had a debilitating amount of anxiety and just overall feelings of despair. It’s only been 2 weeks, but I just feel so scared and so miserable and have found it difficult to adjust. I miss Sara and the happiness and safety that I found living with her. I’ve never experienced such joy in living with someone I’m in love with, and I left it because I knew I had to finally to something for myself. She keeps telling me I made the right decision and this is best for the both of us to grow as people and discover ourselves but I just find myself trapped in a loop of intense regret. 

Besides this, my job is incredibly emotionally taxing here. I am working with my half sister, she is 9 years old and has a severe disability which causes her to have a feeding tube and seizures. I feel honored to get to care for her and be a part of her life in this way, but it is mentally and emotionally challenging in a way Ive never experienced. I’m excited to get to start school and start my new career, but the long road of 5 years to get there seems daunting, and I have a lot of going back and fixing past mistakes from my previous college history in order to make it happen. It makes me really angry with myself and sometimes I can’t help but to think “what’s the point in even trying”. Anyways…… just need some love and support because I am really struggling out here.

Chapter 1
I found out my boyfriend, Edward Ferguson, had just married another woman While we were making love.
""I can't believe you actually married the woman who dumped you back then. What about Esme? She's been so good to you. She loves you!"" his friend shouted.
""I'll stage a fake marriage with her later. She'll never find out."" Edward's voice was cold and impatient. ""You guys just need to keep my marriage to Eliza quiet, don’t let Esme know it.""
I swallowed back my tears. When Edward turned to look at me, I pretended I hadn't understood his Italian and forced a smile.
After he left, I took out my phone and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
***
Inside the Maybach, Edward kissed Esmeralda Wallace until she was breathless.
Her clothes were stripped away, while Edward remained perfectly composed in his suit. The stark contrast between them made her cheeks flush with embarrassment.
He pulled her close, chuckling softly by her ear. ""The partition's up. The driver can't hear, and he wouldn't dare listen. What are you so shy about, hmm?""
The elegant man who had always been calm and distant was now rough and unrestrained. Esmeralda wrapped her arms around him, her eyes brimming with love. Just as the wave of pleasure was about to peak, a sudden ringtone shattered the moment.
Annoyed by the interruption, Edward frowned, but when he saw the caller ID, he still picked up.
Gasping for breath, Esmeralda glanced at the name. It was his closest friend, Owen Vazquez.
""Eddie, have you lost your mind—""
Edward's brows furrowed slightly. In flawless Italian, he cut Owen off mid-sentence. ""This isn't the right time. Speak in Italian.""
There was a pause, then Owen's voice came through in Italian, tense and disbelieving. ""You really married Elizabeth? What the hell are you thinking? She dumped you when you went blind trying to save her. She left you for another man and nearly drove you to ruin! And now you're taking her back?""
The words were foreign, but Esmeralda understood every one of them.
When she finally grasped their meaning, a chill swept through her as if she had been plunged into ice.
Edward, oblivious to her reaction, replied flatly, ""If I don't marry her, her family will force her to wed an old man. I can't let that happen.""
""What about Esmeralda? Back when you lost your sight, she was the only one who stayed by your side. She's loved you for years. She practically gave you her heart. All of us have seen it!""
Hearing the barely restrained anger in his voice, Edward remained composed. ""I'll handle it. She'll never find out.""
""How long are you going to hide it from her? Forever? She's been waiting for you to marry her!""
The more he listened, the more irritated Edward became; his voice quickened. ""Keep my marriage to Eliza quiet. Don't breathe a word. I'll stage a fake marriage with Esme later.""
After hanging up, he didn't bother listening to another word from Owen.
He dropped the phone, pushed it aside, and turned his full attention back to Esmeralda beneath him.
She trembled in his arms. Even after they were done and redressed, she couldn't stop shaking. Just as she was about to speak, his phone chimed again.
It was a message notification from a special contact.
He glanced at the screen, then called to the driver.
""Esme, something urgent came up at work. I'll drop you off here. Take a cab home, okay?""
She didn't say a word. She simply nodded in silence and opened the car door.
The black Maybach shot off down the road, leaving her alone on the curb.
Esmeralda's tears finally spilled over as she watched the traffic blur past.
No one knew that to get closer to Edward, Esmeralda had secretly learned Italian long ago.
So she understood every word he and Owen had exchanged.
Each sentence still echoed in her mind like a thousand sharp blades, piercing deep into her heart.
And with that shattering realization, the memories she had buried for years came flooding back.
Edward was the heir born into privilege, while she was only the daughter of a maid.
That year, she followed her mother into the Ferguson family's grand manor and saw him for the first time. He sat under a shaft of sunlight, playing the piano with effortless grace.
She had never heard such beautiful music, nor seen anyone so breathtakingly perfect.
From that single moment, the name Edward was carved deep into her heart.
She never told anyone about the boy she secretly loved.
It wasn't just because of the vast gulf between their worlds, but because she knew Edward already had someone he liked.
His childhood sweetheart's name was Elizabeth Burton.
He cherished her and protected her like a precious jewel.
At 17, he lost his sight in a car accident while saving her.
But after that, Elizabeth vanished from his life completely. She never visited the Ferguson's manor, never called, and soon appeared on someone else's arm.
The Fergusons had other kids, and his parents, always tied up with work, had little time to look after their now-blind son.
So Edward was sent to live alone in the Ferguson's villa.
And it was Esmeralda who volunteered to go there and care for him for seven long years.
When she was 23, she knelt outside a renowned doctor's home for three days and three nights before finally convincing him to come out of retirement and cure Edward's blindness.
The fallen star regained his brilliance.
Within a year, he reclaimed his position as the heir to the Ferguson Group.
Through winter and summer, it was she who stayed by his side. It was she who kept vigil from dusk till dawn. It was she who endured those seven bitter years with him.
She was the one who kissed him, who held him, who shared his bed.
But she never imagined that the first thing he would do after regaining power was to marry the very woman who had once abandoned him—Elizabeth.
For years, she had worked relentlessly to keep up with his pace, to be worthy of standing beside him.
But no matter how much she changed, his parents never accepted her. They kept thinking she wasn't good enough for their son and even tried to pay her to leave.
Every time, Edward fought with his family for her sake. And because of that, she never thought of leaving him.
But it wasn't until today.
Today, Esmeralda no longer wanted to stay by his side.
She wiped her tears away, pulled out her phone, and dialed a number.
""Mrs. Ferguson, I'll accept the eight million dollars and leave Edward forever.""
Chapter 2
On the other end of the line, Georgia Ferguson's voice trembled with excitement.
""You finally came to your senses? Good. A maid's daughter like you was never worthy of my son—the heir to the Ferguson family. Where are you now? Come over right away. We'll sign the contract.""
Staring at the address Georgia sent moments later, Esmeralda gave a bitter, mocking smile and hailed a cab.
At the café, Georgia questioned her about everything.
Esmeralda answered each question calmly, and when she was done, Georgia's expression turned satisfied. She took out a document and slid it across the table.
""It's all in writing. Once you sign, I'll transfer half of the money to your account immediately. The remaining half will be sent the day you leave. You must promise that once you take the money, you'll never show your face in front of Eddie again. Ever. Do you understand?""
Esmeralda's eyelashes trembled as she looked at the astronomical compensation figure.
She would never show up again.
In this life or the next, she never wanted to see Edward again.
Without hesitation, she picked up the pen and signed her name cleanly and decisively.
Georgia finally relaxed, putting the contract away as she stood up. Before leaving, she gave one last reminder.
""I'm giving you two weeks. I don't care if you can change your identity or move abroad. Just make sure Eddie never sees you again.""
""I understand, Mrs. Ferguson. You have my word.""
After watching Georgia leave, Esmeralda went home.
Ensuring Edward would never see her again was simple.
The Ferguson family had a long military and political lineage—none of their descendants were allowed to emigrate.
All she had to do was move overseas, and Edward would never be able to reach her.
She spent most of the night researching immigration options and finally decided on Australia.
After making up her mind, she picked up her phone to check the time, only to notice a new post notification on her social feed.
When she opened the post, it was a nine-photo collage from Elizabeth.
The top row showed her holding a bouquet of roses, the middle displayed three marriage certificates, and the bottom showed intertwined hands with matching rings.
Esmeralda knew that since Edward wanted to keep his marriage a secret, he would never have allowed Elizabeth to post it.
But she still did, and she had even set the audience to ""visible only to Esmeralda."" A deliberate show of triumph.
Esmeralda smiled faintly and gave it a like.
The moment she exited the app, a message from Edward appeared.
""Esme, I'm going on a business trip. I won't be home for the next few days.""
She replied with a simple ""Okay,"" put down her phone, and went to wash up.
The next morning, she got up early to start her immigration paperwork.
Since she was in a hurry, she applied for the expedited process.
The clerk assured her it would be completed within two weeks, and only then did she finally breathe a sigh of relief.
Once she got in the car, she scrolled through Elizabeth's social feed again.
This time, half of Edward's figure appeared in the photo.
The two of them were holding hands, touring a new house, and in the end, they had settled on a villa in South Bay Estates.
Just like yesterday, Esmeralda hit the like button.
On the third day, she went to her company and handed in her resignation.
After packing up her things and returning home, she saw yet another update—Elizabeth in a wedding gown, the diamond on her ring finger sparkling brilliantly.
As always, Esmeralda gave it a like, then buried herself under the covers.
The fourth day came, and when she woke up, her feed had another update.
This time, the photo was of the framed wedding portrait hanging in the couple's new home.
Esmeralda stared at it for a long while before snapping out of it.
She liked the post again, then put on makeup and went out to have a farewell dinner with a few close friends.
That evening, she returned home carrying several boxes and began throwing away everything connected to Edward.
All the gifts he had given her, their matching toothbrushes and cups, the photos they had taken together—every trace of him went into the trash.
By the time she finished, it was past midnight.
She was about to turn off the lights when Edward suddenly came home.
He froze at the sight of the half-empty apartment, his brow furrowing.
""Why does it look like half the stuff in here is gone?""
""I didn't like them anymore, so I threw them out. We can always buy new ones later.""
Edward nodded, tossing his jacket onto the couch, but his gaze landed on the boxes stacked nearby.
""You quit your job?""
He paused, then noticed the Social Security card sitting on the coffee table.
""Why did you take that out?""
""I've been tired lately and need a break, so I resigned. The card is for some paperwork I need to handle.""
She answered calmly, packing her things as she spoke.
Seeing how composed she was, Edward didn't suspect anything. Pulling her into his arms, he spoke softly. ""I've been swamped these past few days and haven't had time for you. Your birthday's coming up in a few days. How about I take you to the auction house tomorrow and let you pick something you like?""
Esmeralda didn't refuse.
The next day, as soon as they took their seats in the grand hall, she spotted Elizabeth.
Elizabeth sauntered up confidently and sat down right beside Edward.
All night, Edward kept his attention solely on Esmeralda, never sparing a glance to the side.
When the auction ended, he didn't linger. He simply took her hand and led her downstairs.
Before heading home, Esmeralda stopped at the restroom.
When she came out, she saw Elizabeth cornered on the staircase by a group of arrogant young men. Their mocking laughter echoed through the hall.
""Well, well, isn't this Ms. Burton? The one who dumped Edward after he lost his sight. Looks like retribution finally caught up with you, huh?""
""I heard your father's marrying you off to some dying old man. You're still decent-looking, though. How about you come with us instead? We'd take good care of—""
The rest of his words were cut short.
Edward appeared at the top of the stairs, his expression dark as thunder. Without hesitation, he kicked the men aside with ruthless force.
Chapter 3
Then Edward grabbed the man who had been leading the group, pinned him to the ground, and punched him over and over, mercilessly. Blood splattered; the men cried out, begging for mercy.
""I'm sorry, Mr. Ferguson! Please forgive us and let us go!""
""Get lost! If I ever see you near her again, you'll deal with me personally!""
His furious roar sent the men scrambling away.
A crowd had gathered on the staircase, watching the scene unfold.
Edward ignored the stares and helped Elizabeth to her feet. ""Are you hurt?""
She fell into his arms, tears streaming down her face. ""My ankle hurts a lot.""
His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he scooped her up and pushed through the crowd, holding her close.
In the process of shielding her, his arm brushed hard against Esmeralda, knocking her backward.
Her head struck the sharp edge of a marble step with a sickening thud. Blood began to pour from the wound, making the onlookers gasp.
""She's bleeding! Someone call an ambulance!""
The pain was excruciating. Esmeralda's face twisted as cold sweat covered her skin.
Warm blood seeped between her fingers, dripping onto her eyelashes.
Through the haze, she saw Edward's back as he walked away without even turning around.
Once upon a time, when she had cut her finger while making soup for him, he had fussed for half a day. He insisted on calling a doctor as he was terrified it would scar.
She had teased him for overreacting, and he had lowered his head, kissed her hand, and said softly, ""Esme, you're the person I hold closest to my heart. When you get hurt, it hurts me more. Things are getting better now. You don't need to do all this yourself anymore. You will still have to wear the ring I'm going to give you. It wouldn't look right with a scar.""
Now she was bleeding in front of him, and he didn't even glance her way.
And that ring he had once promised her? It now glittered on another woman's hand.
The ambulance took Esmeralda to the hospital.
She registered herself, saw the doctor, picked up her medication, and went home alone. It was long past midnight when she was done.
That night, the pain kept her awake. She tossed and turned until dawn.
Edward never came home.
The next morning, she dragged her aching body out of bed to change her dressing and saw a new post from Elizabeth.
It was a video of Edward kneeling on one knee, gently massaging her ankle, and applying medicine.
Esmeralda watched it over and over, her eyes reddening before she eventually drifted into a restless sleep.
When she woke, the sky outside was already dark.
Her phone buzzed nonstop beside the pillow. She answered, and Edward's voice came through.
""Come to private room 703 at The Pavilion now.""
Esmeralda hesitated for a moment before getting out of bed.
After washing up, she quickly headed out.
When she pushed open the door, the first person she saw was Elizabeth.
Her eyes were red, her expression pitiful as if she were a fragile little rabbit.
Edward sat across from her, his face unreadable, the air around him heavy with tension.
Silence hung thick in the room until Esmeralda finally spoke.
""Why did you ask me to come here?""
Edward straightened in his seat, clasping his hands together with the poise of someone used to being in control.
""Esme, did you send those men from last night to harass her?""
Esmeralda froze.
Her eyes flicked to Elizabeth, catching the faint glimmer of satisfaction flashing in them.
In that instant, she understood everything. This was all Elizabeth's doing.
She gave a weary, ironic smile. ""No. I don't know those people, and I wouldn't waste my time doing something like that.""
Her calm explanation didn't change the darkness on Edward's face.
He lowered his gaze, his voice even but cold. ""Esme, when Elizabeth left me years ago, I let her go completely. You've been with me for seven years. You should know who's in my heart now. The Burton family has fallen on hard times, and everyone's eager to kick them while they are down. But you shouldn't be one of them. You don't need to make things harder for her because of me.""
His words hit her like a blade twisting deep inside.
Memories of him breaking down in the middle of the night, chasing after doctors, fighting for his sight, and the hopeless diagnosis that he would never see again flooded her mind.
The man, who was born with every advantage, had lost his sight completely for the sake of one girl.
Seven years of devotion, gone with a few indifferent words, as if they'd meant nothing.
She thought of the marriage certificate stamped with both his and Elizabeth's names. Her eyes burned with tears. ""You're right. We've been together seven years, and I'm only now realizing who you truly have in your heart.""
Edward frowned. ""What do you mean by that?""
Esmeralda shook her head with a bitter smile. ""I mean, I'm just a maid's daughter. Do you really think I'd have the money or the connections to hire people like that to humiliate an heiress?""
Even with her words laid bare, he still didn't believe her.
She was too tired to explain any further.
She took a deep breath and asked softly, ""If you don't believe me, just tell me what you want me to do.""
Edward rubbed his temple. ""Apologize. Esme, when you've done something wrong, you should say you're sorry.""
At that moment, Elizabeth, who had been sitting meekly to the side, finally spoke up in a soft, trembling voice.
""No need to apologize. If you truly feel sorry, drink these.""
Chapter 4
The table was lined with glasses of amber-colored whiskey.
Esmeralda's gaze lifted to Edward, searching his face for a clear answer.
But the lighting was dim, and his expression was unreadable in the shadows.
The silence was suffocating; every breath felt like it was draining the air from her lungs.
Her breathing quickened, and a flood of memories surged through her mind.
When she first moved into the Ferguson's villa, Edward, who was blind and bitter, had drowned himself in alcohol every night.
Worried about his health, she had tried to stop him, again and again, but he never listened.
One night, drunk beyond reason, he had sneered at her and pushed several bottles toward her.
""Even a maid's daughter dares to lecture me now? I really have fallen low. Fine. If you drink these, I'll do as you say.""
She had wanted to tell him that she wasn't trying to control him and that she was just worried.
But instead, despite being allergic to alcohol, she had picked up the bottle and drank without hesitation.
Minutes later, she was rushed to the hospital.
When she woke, he was sitting by her bed, his face dark and cold. ""I'm the one who was drunk, not you. You knew you were allergic, so why would you risk your life like that?""
She had only whispered, ""Because I care about you, Mr. Ferguson. Your eyes will heal someday. And even if they don't, I'll still stay with you. So please, don't give up.""
From that day on, Edward quit drinking.
For years after, there wasn't a single bottle of alcohol in the house.
Thinking of that now, Esmeralda smiled faintly, though her eyes shimmered with unshed tears.
Without explaining herself, she reached for the small packet of chili powder beside her and emptied it into one of the glasses. Her tone was steady, final.
""These few glasses hardly prove anything, do they? I'll take this as punishment. Will that be enough for you?""
Before anyone could react, she lifted a glass and drank it down, one after another.
The burning bitterness spread from her tongue down her throat, searing its way through her chest, stomach, and heart—everywhere he'd once lived inside her.
By the seventh glass, Edward finally lost his composure.
""That's enough!""
Esmeralda looked at the untouched glasses left on the table and let out a hollow laugh.
""Enough? So that means I've apologized properly? Have I pleased the woman you love now?""
At that, Edward stood up abruptly and grabbed her wrist.
His usually emotionless face was dark with fury.
""You know that's not what I meant! Esme, I told you that there's nothing between me and Elizabeth anymore. My family doesn't want you marrying into the Ferguson family, and if you keep acting like this, they'll use it against you. I just don't want you to get hurt or be talked about!""
His words sounded righteous, even protective.
But to Esmeralda, they were nothing but excuses.
If the Ferguson family couldn't accept a maid's daughter like her, how could they possibly accept Elizabeth—the woman who had abandoned him?
And yet, despite everything, he had still married her.
Because when it came to love, he had always chosen her.
Esmeralda no longer wanted to argue. She yanked her hand free and turned toward the door.
But before she could take two steps, her body swayed, and everything went black.
""Esme!""
Edward's heart stopped. He lunged forward, catching her before she hit the ground.
As he lifted her into his arms, Elizabeth's trembling voice rose behind him. ""Eddie, I feel dizzy...""
He froze for a second—but only a second.
Then he strode out without looking back.
""I'm taking Esme to the hospital. Call your assistant to take care of you.""
When Esmeralda opened her eyes again, she was in a hospital ward.
Edward, who hadn't slept all night, finally exhaled when he saw her open her eyes.
Their gazes met and lingered for a long time, neither of them saying a word.
He finally poured her a glass of warm water, tucked the blanket around her, then called the doctor to run another check and carefully noted every instruction.
He even canceled all his meetings, despite Donovan Nicholson waiting anxiously outside the door.
Watching that, Esmeralda finally spoke. ""You should go to work. I can take care of myself. This isn't something you need to do.""
His hand paused mid-motion, his voice soft but heavy. ""I should do it, Esme. Don't you remember? You were the one who used to take care of me like this.""
A flicker of confusion crossed her eyes.
Back then, when he had lost his sight and been cast aside by his family, she had stayed.
She had learned Braille to teach him, helped him read, took him for walks in the sun, and cooked all his favorite dishes.
It felt as if she had stolen a piece of the moon for herself. The once-dim world around her was filled with light.
Those seven years had been the happiest of her life.
But the moon was never hers. Now, she couldn't go back.
That afternoon, the doctor escorted her to the examination room.
Half an hour later, a nurse helped her back to her ward.
As she pushed the door open, she saw Edward holding her phone, his brow furrowed and his voice cold as he spoke to Georgia.
""I've told you before that Esme and I love each other. I don't care about her background. You can stop interfering. I'm going to marry her, and she's not leaving me.""
Hearing the sound, he looked up at her, and a moment later, Georgia's puzzled voice came through the phone.
""What do you mean she's not leaving? Didn't you know? Esmeralda already agreed to leave the country a few days ago...""",1,1762411473.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

But I've read up a lot and I know the basics. Right from the start, I swapped out the supplied basket for a precision basket, as everyone always recommends. But I just can't get a drinkable espresso out of my Dedica. I've tried almost every imaginable combo of grind size, temperature setting, and coffee dose, but the coffee is always way too sour. Here are the details of my ""best"" attempt so far:

-Grind size: 53 clicks (0.5.3) on the 1Zpresso X-Ultra (I thought it would be too Coarse but grinding finer doesn't help/makes it worse)

-Dose: 17 grams (The basket holds 16 to 18 grams)

-Vertically compacted by tapping the basket and evenly distributed with a WDT tool

-Tamped with 30lb pressure (Tamper is self-leveling and gives feedback when pressure is reached)

-Temperature: Highest setting on the Dedica

-Held down the two-cup button until a ratio of 1:2.7 was reached (45 grams after approx. 30 seconds)

-Stirred briefly and tasted: Least sour compared to my other attempts. But the rest of the taste was very thin and watery.

I had someone taste the coffee who hadn't tried the other attempts and hadn't gotten used to the acidity. She said the coffee was ""undrinkably sour and non-drinkable.""

Thanks to my many attempts, I'm at a point where I hardly have any channeling anymore. It can't be the coffee either. It's a medium roast, ""intensity 6/10""  and 100% Arabica. I also tried the coffee in another espresso machine, and it tasted great—nowhere near as sour as from the Dedica.

I find it weird that I'm having so many issues because in videos, it always looks like an automatic upgrade—they swap out the filter, and the coffee instantly gets better. For me, it's the exact opposite. Plus, everyone always says you just need to find roughly the right grind size and then you can tweak it to your taste. But for me, it seems like there might be only one grind size, if any, where the coffee is even barely drinkable.

I'm truly at my wit's end and feel like I'm either fundamentally misunderstanding something or the machine is faulty.

Can someone help me out?

You did your homework, and you ensure you have all your data aligned. You launched, then you failed!

What do you do next?

Frankly, there are no one-size-fits-all rules here. Sometimes what users actually want becomes your worst nightmare. Sometimes what nobody wants at all becomes the best seller.

I think it boils down to this: great products packaged wrong don't sell. Bad products well packaged do sell.

So the real question isn't whether you did your homework or missed the point. The real question is how determined and patient can you be, and what's the motivation behind it.

Some launches fail because the time to launch was swallowed by an urgent need for cash, and users can smell it. Sometimes users buy from who they know. Sometimes they prefer buying from complete strangers.

Though there are plenty of rules out there trying to make this journey a quick one-go track, it's not always true.

Sometimes everyone does the same exact thing and they all succeed. Then you start doing the 21st exact thing and you fail. Then someone does the 22nd exact same thing and succeeds.

Sometimes you play absolutely honest cards and everyone thinks you're there to scam them. And sometimes the real scammers are welcomed by the same people who rejected you.

Sometimes that's just the way it goes.

I've found that regardless of how much you invest whetger it be both in time and money, if it's not your time to shine, you try in vain.

One of the most painful lessons of life as an entrepreneur is being forced to put gain before legacy. And often this hurts more than anything else.

The real question of entrepreneurship is to look 200 years down the road at what will last after you, not just the quick paycheck or MRR.

It's true that this can be challenging, but the first question is: why are you building what you're building? And has the time ripened for you yet?

For some people it takes 30 days, some 60 weeks, and some 100 months.

There's no golden one-size-fits-all except this: make sure you wisely define where you're going before you start. This will take you a much longer way toward reward.

In a society where everything must be done fast and now, you can get caught up doing things to the point of burnout, and later find you're all sucked dry because your vision was focused on pleasing the ever-changing whims of consumer trends rather than impacting someone's life.

It's not the easiest journey, but it's the most rewarding when you've predetermined where you want to go and press forward to get there.

But get back up and DO it again.

In every labs research, failures is a proof you're closer to the findings!


Here are real life stories to tell you, you ain't the first nor alone.

**The Timing Paradox:**
- **Howard Schultz** tried to convince Starbucks owners to sell espresso drinks in 1982—they said no. He left, started his own coffee bar, and eventually bought Starbucks in 1987. His idea was right, but the timing within that organization wasn't ready yet.

- **James Dyson** spent 15 years and created 5,127 prototypes of his bagless vacuum cleaner. Every major manufacturer rejected him. He finally launched it himself in 1993 and became a billionaire. Same product, same person—just needed the right moment.

**Bad Packaging Wins, Good Product Loses:**
- **Betamax vs VHS:** Sony's Betamax was technically superior—better picture quality, more advanced. But VHS had better distribution, longer recording time, and won the format war completely. The worse product, better packaged.

- **Snapchat's ""My AI""** was launched with terrible user reception—people hated it, couldn't remove it, felt forced. Yet Snapchat's user base kept growing. Bad feature, aggressive packaging, still succeeded.

**The Honest Person Labeled a Scammer:**
- **Sara Blakely** (Spanx founder) spent two years being rejected by manufacturers and hung up on by potential buyers. People thought her pantyhose idea was ridiculous or a gimmick. She was honest about what she was selling, but department stores wouldn't take meetings. Meanwhile, established hosiery companies with questionable product claims had shelf space. She eventually became the youngest self-made female billionaire.

**The 30 Days vs 100 Months Reality:**
- **Instagram:** Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger built it in 8 weeks, launched, and got 25,000 users the first day. Sold to Facebook for $1 billion two years later.

- **Amazon:** Jeff Bezos started in 1994. Lost money for years. Didn't turn a meaningful annual profit until 2003—nine years later. People mocked him relentlessly. Now he's one of the richest people alive.

- **Airbnb:** Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia started in 2007. By 2009, they were so broke they sold cereal boxes to stay afloat. Rejected by investors constantly. It took them nearly 10 years to IPO in 2020. Same founders, same idea—just needed time to ripen.

**Legacy Over Quick Cash:**
- **Yvon Chouinard** (Patagonia founder) built a billion-dollar company but refused to sell it for profit. In 2022, he gave the entire company away to a trust dedicated to fighting climate change. He chose 200-year impact over a multi-billion-dollar payday.

- **Paul Graham** could have cashed out Y Combinator many times over for enormous sums. Instead, he kept it focused on helping founders build meaningful companies. He built a legacy that changed startup culture entirely.

**Playing the Same Game, Different Outcomes:**
- In the meal kit delivery space: **Blue Apron** IPO'd in 2017 at $1.9 billion valuation, then crashed to under $100 million. **HelloFresh** did essentially the same thing, launched around the same time, and is now worth over $10 billion. Same model, same market, wildly different results.

**The Burnout from Chasing Trends:**
- **Dennis Crowley** built Dodgeball (a location check-in app) in 2000, sold it to Google in 2005. Google shut it down. He built Foursquare in 2009 doing almost the same thing—became massive. But by 2016, he stepped back, exhausted from constantly pivoting to chase whatever trend investors wanted. He admitted he'd lost sight of why he built it in the first place.

**When It's Just Not Your Time:**
- **Milton Hershey** failed in candy businesses four times before Hershey's Chocolate succeeded. Same person, same skills, same determination—just different timing.

- **Colonel Sanders** was 62 years old, broke, living off social security when he started franchising KFC. He was rejected 1,009 times before someone said yes. His time came when most people are retiring.

I'm flying to Denmark in a few days and have thought of bringing gifts/souvenirs for my soon-to-be in-laws there.

I've brought some non-food items already the last time I went there hence why I chose these two this time.

  
I'm coming from a non-EU country and am not familiar with the customs regulations there, so I have done a bit of research. From what I can find is that one is allowed to bring coffee with max weight of 500gr for personal use without having to pay customs taxes.



The problem is:

I couldn't find much information about cacao. Any of you have any knowledge of what's acceptable and not? And maybe have more knowledge regarding coffee as well?
