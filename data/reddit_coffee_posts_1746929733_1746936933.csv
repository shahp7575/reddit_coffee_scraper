Kanina, I was watching this collegiate game, nothing big, just supporting my fave team. While waiting at the entrance with my brother (coffee time, chill lang), I spotted this masc girl na familiar sakin. Turns out, she’s the GF of a known player from the team I support. So syempre, fangirl moment, pero kalma ako.

Throughout the day, sobrang dami naming salubungan—like random, awkward hallway moments. But here’s where it got weird. I went to the CR—wala pang tao. Then pumasok siya. She stayed in the cubicle for so long and ako rin, tagal ko mag-ayos. Ang dami nang pumasok at lumabas na tao, kami dalawa lang natira.

Habang nasa sink ako, ayun na. She stepped out and started fixing herself too. At sobrang lala ng mirroring namin. Like every time I adjusted my cap, she’d adjust hers. Hair, stance, kunwari busy. Pero neither of us spoke or looked directly. It was just this… queer tension hanging in the air.

I was this close to saying something like “do you wanna make out or what” (EME HAHAHA) pero I chickened out. Kasi hello—may jowa siya. Pero like… what was that?!

1kjsb6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kjsb6p/i_found_a_confession_from_a_serial_killer_called/,I found a confession from a serial killer called The Wayside Ripper,"
Last week, I bought an old filing cabinet off Facebook Marketplace. The guy was clearing out his dad’s shed in Walliston, said it had been untouched for years. I didn’t think much of it—just needed something to organise my tools.

When I got home and yanked open the bottom drawer, something caught. A false back. Curiosity got the better of me, so I pulled it free, expecting maybe old cash or porn mags.

Instead, there were seven hand-written notebooks. No names on the covers—just dates. 2004 to 2023.

I read one. Then another. I haven’t slept since.

They're confessions.

Detailed, methodical, horrifying confessions.

The author calls himself The Wayside Ripper. According to his notes, he’s a 36-year-old man, Australian-born, and claims to have killed over fifty people. Mostly women, some men. All of them described down to the last breath.

He doesn’t use a knife or a gun. He strangles them. With something he calls a “grunt strap”—some kind of repurposed weightlifting band, reinforced with paracord and wire. He calls it ""silent and certain.""

Each entry begins the same way:

> “I never meant to be a monster. But the urge… it’s louder than conscience. Like a second heartbeat.”



He’d watch them for days. Bus stops, shopping centres, walking home alone after work. He never rushed. He talks about “rhythms,” patterns, waiting for their routines to slip. No dogs. No partners. No cameras.

Then, he’d strike.

One victim, “Louise R.,” was a nurse. He followed her for six weeks. Knew her shifts. Knew where she bought coffee. Knew that on Thursdays she took the fire trail shortcut through the Lesmurdie bushlands to save ten minutes on her walk.

He grabbed her from behind, threw a towel over her face, and used the grunt strap. He wrote that she twitched for a long time. He timed it. Eighty-seven seconds.

Then he dumped her. “In the folds of the earth,” he said. “Where only the bush hears them rot.”

Every one of the fifty-plus entries ends with GPS coordinates—scrawled hastily in the margin. I plugged three into Google Earth. They all point to areas deep in the hills and forest past Lesmurdie Falls. Remote. Inaccessible unless you know what you're looking for.

And this is where it gets worse.

One of the last entries is dated three months ago. It reads:

> “The news thinks I stopped. That I aged out. But I just got better at hiding. They’ll never catch me. And even if they do… I’ve already written my truth. I am the silence between missing posters.”



There’s one more line under that.

> “If someone’s reading this… maybe you’re the next me.”



I reported it to Crime Stoppers anonymously, sent scans of the journals. But I haven’t heard anything. I even drove out near one of the marked locations myself—but as soon as I got close to the tree line, I swear I saw someone watching me from the scrub.

I’m posting this because I need people to know. I don’t care if it gets deleted or buried.

There’s a killer out there. He might be done.

Or he might be looking for someone to carry the strap.

I know drinking water is supposed to be the solution to water weight, but it feels like the rate at which I use the bathroom doesn't match the amount of water I drink. Back when I was working my old job, during my break, I'd always chug down like 2 things of diet pepsi  and drink a bottle of water with my eventual dinner. Nowadays, I find myself drinking a bottle's worth of coffee for breakfast and drinking a bottle of water with my dinner. But through it all, I don't really pee that often. Maybe like, twice a day at most. I know I'm in a deficit, but it's like everyday the water weight makes it look like i'm gaining weight rather than losing anything because the weight barely goes down. I know weight is supposed to fluctuate too, and i'm certain this was the case back during the thanksgiving where I gained like 10 pounds in the span of 1-2 days, struggling to get back down to where I originally was for months, but is it really all just water weight? Is it really all because I'm not drinking enough? (Admittedly, normal/refined carbs have been a regular part of my diet for a long while now)

I know i'm supposed to be drinking about 4 bottles of water a day, but I tend to slip back into drinking sometimes 1 a day or 2 simply out of paranoia every time i see the bloat of water weight affect my stomach and the number going up. It's insanely discouraging when i hit a new milestone mainly thanks to dehydrating myself only for my weight to unironically skyrocket 10+ pounds in a day just because I chose to drink a lot of water for that one day.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/KXg5cPsCba): **April 30, 2025**

I (35F) and my husband (36M) have a 5 year old daughter. Recently she found our wedding album and has been absolutely obsessed with weddings and everything to do with them. She’s been asking us a bunch of questions, for example why we got married. We’ve just been answering that we love each-other a lot and thought it was right for us.

Recently a friend of ours invited us to their 6th year wedding anniversary party. The friend who was hosting the party and I are apart of a pretty large female friendship group that started in our law school days. All of us are either married with children, engaged or in a relationship of some sort.

Mandy (35F) is apart of this friendship group and is in a relationship with Baz (38M). Mandy and Baz have been together for almost 8 years now, for the past 5 Mandy has been expressing to us that she really wants to get married but Baz is very avoidant about it. To the point that when it’s brought up he just says “it’s just a piece of paper” and “I don’t need the governments approval to love you”. Despite us gently suggesting that he might be unserious about her and that if they have different views on marriage they shouldn’t be together she insists they are meant to be and that he’ll come to his senses.

At the party all of the couples and kids were invited and my daughter was over the moon about all the wedding stuff. Mandy eventually strikes up a conversation with my daughter about school and such. My kid notices Baz and Mandy together and asks if they are married, why they aren’t married when they will get married in a very awkward “wvhen wvill you wvear wvigs” type manner. I was nearby and overheard the conversation and immediately tried to change the subject apologised as I knew this was a touchy subject for Mandy. I made her apologise to Mandy for being nosy but then she kinda snaps back at my daughter saying “well we aren’t married because I truely love him and I’m not a gold digger lol”.

Some context my husband is a very successful architect and his family comes from some wealth, my family is the opposite with me being a first generation law student. I had opened up to Mandy in the past that I was worried to meet my husbands family in case they think I’m just with him for his money and got nervous about what people thought once they knew I didn’t originally come from wealth. I love my husband, have a great relationship with his family and I’m very successful in my field as well but I knew the comment was directed at me.

She is the breadwinner in her relationship and has made snarky comments to me before about the size of my ring and how it’s looks “too big and greedy” and will opt for a different style when her and Baz get married. She has even implied that my husband is unattractive and made a comment that I only got pregnant early into the marriage because I wanted to “seal that generational wealth down with a baby” when I announced my pregnancy. Each time I kinda laughed it off and moved on, except for the last comment which I shut down hard and kinda scared her out of saying anything else until this party.

Everyone else there also overheard the conversation and knew the context of that comment and the room just kinda went silent and awkward. It was the end of the party so we kinda just left and said goodbye to the host. That was about two days ago, today she sent me a message saying people were texting her that what she said wasn’t cool and that she should apologise. She gave a very half assed apology and said that she probably wouldn’t have said anything if I had just “shut my kid up earlier”. To that I responded to not ever shit talk my kid and that I wanted space from her and said that this broke the camels back as it was said to my daughter. I told the other friends about the text and thankfully they backed me up and told her she was being a bitch. I think they were riding her so hard because a lot of the friend group were also first generation students with equally successful partners. She sent a follow up apology that was slightly more sincere and asked me to get people off her back. My husband is equally as mad but said to maybe cut her a little slack because she is in such a shit place in her relationship and is projecting out of fear.

The comment really hurt my feelings but I knew she was in a tough place with Baz and probably could’ve controlled my daughter a little earlier. So AITA?

Update posted idk how reddit works but it was too long so I made a new post

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received mixed reactions**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** This is why kids perhaps do not belong at gatherings like this.

> **OOP:** I do get it and trust me I’m not the type of parent that just brings her kid everywhere but all of the couples that had kids where invited to bring their kids. I even asked the hosts when they were planning the party if they were sure they wanted kids there and they said yes because they wanted a “laid back family barbecue vibe”.

**OOP's thoughts on Baz**

> **OOP:** I do think there is some truth to what your saying as I don’t like Baz because I think he really isn’t too nice to Mandy. I do agree marriage isn’t the end all be all but for Mandy it 100% is which is why I don’t think her and Baz are a great match and have told her so. I’ve held on to the friendship with Mandy so long because we have such a long history together but I do think it might be time to go our separate ways. We have explained to our kid about same sex couples, divorce etc before but I should clarify she is mostly obsessed with the “wedding” parts of marriage and hasn’t really fully grasped what it actually means yet

**OOP responds to a comment regarding not using her daughter as the messenger regarding Mandy's relationship**

> **OOP:** Although I do have my opinions about her relationship i do not talk about any of that with or around my daughter cause it’s adults business. I would never use my daughter as any sort of messenger, and all opinions I have on Mandy’s relationship I have relayed to Mandy face to face when she has requested it.

**OOP should had keep her opinions to herself when it comes to Mandy's relationship or someone else's since she pointed out critiques of the relationship**

> **OOP:** That is a fair opinion but I will also clarify that I intervened as soon as I realised my daughter wasn’t just asking one question on the subject and as I said in the post I tried to veer her away from the conversation and after that didn’t work I made her apologise for being nosy. Mandy was still my friend and regardless of my opinion it was still a sore spot for her. I would never want to intentionally make my friend upset to get a point across.

**OOP provides an example of the conversation between her daughter and Mandy**

> **OOP:** Let me clarify, I intervened by trying to essentially redirect my daughter to a different area of the party to not make things too awkward, but in typical curious kid fashion they were rapid fast, It kinda went like this:
> 
> Daughter: are you married
> 
> Mandy: haha no
> 
> Me: walks over (insert daughters name) come try the (insert party food) with me
> 
> Daughter: (virtually ignores me) why aren’t you guys married
> 
> Me: (daughter name) cmon let’s go (I try to pull her away)
> 
> Mandy: awkward chuckling
> 
> I then interrupted my daughter before she could fully get the third question out but context clues made it obvious that she was about to ask if they were going to get married soon - after I cut her off I made her apologise for being too nosy. My thinking was that if I focus on redirecting her train of thought instead of scolding her in front of everyone it would make things slightly less awkward. I do admit I could’ve put in more effort into cutting the questions off immediately.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/aNub9PUNFt): **May 4, 2025 (four days later)**

I originally wasn’t going to update on the situation because I was honestly just going to ghost Mandy for a while and just forget about this whole thing. But I read some of the comments and decided to talk to my daughter.

My Husband and I sat her down and talked to her about how there are many different types of relationships because there are many different types of people. We told her some people want to get married, some don’t and that’s ok and how getting married isn’t just about a wedding it’s a big commitment to another person. We also said that people can have long and happy relationship without getting married and that isn’t something to look down on people on. We also said that it is ultimately her choice to decide if she ever wants to get married in the future and we would support her no matter what.

We then explained that being curious and asking questions is a good thing but marriage and weddings can be very personal for a lot of people and if they don’t want to talk about it to respect that. She seemed to understand and still loves weddings and looks at my husband and i’s wedding album often but had thankfully chilled out a lil.

I was still a bit confused on what to do about Mandy as I had some mixed opinions in the comments. I did get a few that stuck with me asking why we are even friends if she doesn’t like me. I didn’t want to confront the issue again but in the past few days I found out I’m pregnant with a second kid. After the intial joy with my husband surpassed a little I got sad thinking about this drama and thinking about how I only wanted people around me who wholehareatedly supported me. I ended up sending a msg to Mandy asking to meet up for a coffee.

When I met her I told her that we had been friends a long time but her past comments about me hurt. I apologised for my daughter at the party but that didn’t make her comment ok. I also apologised if I ever came off to her as being judgmental or unaproving of her relationship with Baz and that I only wanted her to be happy and if she is I completely support her. I then told her about the pregnancy and said that if she didn’t like me that was her prerogative but I only wanted people around me that support me in this period of my life.

She took it in and actually apologised for her comments and admitted that they were mean spirited. She felt that because of her family she’s always had pressure to live up to “traditional family life” even though she didn’t want to and was happy with the way things were with Baz. I was happy we reached some sort of understanding but things took a turn for the worst. She confessed that she purposely started saying mean comments to prevent me from falling into the stay at home mum “trap”??? I was confused and she clarified that two other women in the group have done the same after having children and she predicted that I would go down the same route so to “protect me” after I got engaged she started indirectly shaming me in hopes I wouldn’t quit my job to take care of my kids!?!?!?!?! (I HAVE NEVER ONCE SAID I WANTED TO BE A STAY AT HOME MOTHER BTW). I told her that was fucking crazy and that I never once said I wanted to stop working because I love my job. She said that was a good thing but she thought I would because of how often I talk about my daughter and how in her eyes I crave the validation of my husband too much. I said that she was being mean and that I’ve treasured her friendship for a long time but I need to think about if it was worth saving. I’m now in my car typing this head-spinning.

I don’t want to be her friend anymore but I’m scared that other people might shame me into it because of the baby coming. What do I do?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It sounds like this meet-up with Mandy was a sincere attempt on your part but everything she said, the pressure from her parents and the supposed plan to save you from a ""trap"", was all just her looking for ways to deflect the responsibility for what she did. It shows that her so-called apology is not sincere at all.

It is completely reasonable that you don't want to be her friend anymore because it is clear that she is not your friend and hasn't been in a long time.

**Commenter 2:** Go low contact. When asked by other people, just reply with answers like ""we have some disagreements"" or ""too busy"" (depends on who is asking).

As a mom of two and never once wanting to be a stay-at-home mom, what Mandy said only confirmed that 1) she IS rude, 2) she is full of biases, and 3) she does not know you, at all. This is no friend of yours, it's time to drop some dead weight, you'll find life so much better after that.

**Commenter 3:** Please reread what you wrote while imagining your daughter going through the same experience with a ""friend"". Would you tell her to forgive the same manipulation, agression and cruelty? Would you worry about this clearly damaged person being around your granddaughter and soon to be grandchild?

Protect yourself like you would protect your children.

I (29F) have a brother, Jake (32M), who’s getting married in two months to Emma (30F). Emma’s sweet, grounded, a nurse, and clearly in love with him. They’ve been together three years, and from the outside, they seem perfect.

But here’s the thing: Jake has a 10-year-old daughter, Lily, from a relationship in college. Most of our family knows. But Emma... does not.

Jake always claimed he wasn’t ready to be a dad and signed away custody when Lily was born. Her mom, Tara, is a friend of mine and we live in the same town. I see Lily maybe once a month—birthdays, school plays, ice cream outings. She knows me as her “Auntie.”

But what’s eating at me is this: Jake told Emma that Lily died in infancy. I only found out because a few months ago, Lily mentioned she tried to message him on Facebook and got blocked. Tara later confessed Jake told her to never let Lily contact him—or Emma.

I confronted him. His exact words were:

“She’s not part of my life. I’m not screwing up my future over a mistake I made at 21.”
I was stunned. I told him it was cruel, and he got defensive. Said I had no right to butt in. That Emma would ""freak"" and he'd lose everything.

I let it go for a while. But a week ago, I ran into Emma at a coffee shop. She was gushing about how excited she is to start a family, saying how Jake would be “the best first-time dad.”

I felt sick.

So two days later, I invited her over under the guise of bridal planning... and I told her. Everything. I showed her a photo of Lily and said, “I’m sorry, but you deserve to know.”

Emma cried. A lot. She left without saying much.

Jake called me the next night screaming. Said Emma moved out. Said I destroyed his life. My parents are torn—my dad says I did the right thing, my mom says I betrayed “family blood.” Tara thanked me but warned Jake might retaliate legally somehow (no idea how that would even work).

It’s been a week. I haven’t heard from Emma, and Jake isn’t returning my texts. My boyfriend says I was brave, but even he’s unsure if it was “my place.”

1kjs01a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBeautyCircle/comments/1kjs01a/morning_vs_night_skincare_routine_everything_you/,Morning vs. Night Skincare Routine: Everything You Need to Know,"Hey there, skincare enthusiast! Ever wondered why your skin isn’t glowing like it should, even though you’re slathering on products daily? Chances are, you might be treating your morning and night routines like they’re the same thing. Spoiler alert: they’re not! Morning skincare is all about **protection**, while nighttime is for **repair**. Let’s chat about how to give your skin what it needs, when it needs it, with a routine that’s as fun as it is effective. Ready to level up your skincare game? :)

# Why Morning and Night Routines Are Different

Picture this: during the day, your skin’s out there fighting UV rays, pollution, and who-knows-what-else. Your morning routine is like putting on armor to shield it from those environmental baddies. At night, though, your skin’s in recovery mode, fixing damage and rebuilding while you’re dreaming of that perfect latte. So, your night routine is more like a cozy blanket, nurturing and repairing. Mixing these up is like wearing flip-flops in a snowstorm—cute, but not helpful.

# Your Morning Skincare Routine: Ready for the Day

The morning routine is about prepping your skin to face the world. Think lightweight, protective products that keep you glowing without feeling heavy. Here’s the step-by-step lowdown:

# Step 1: Cleansing

Start by washing away any sweat or oil from the night. A gentle cleanser does the trick without stripping your skin. I love the [**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Moisturizing/dp/B01MSSDEPK?tag=beauty04a2-20)—it’s super hydrating and feels like a hug for your face.

# Step 2: Toning

Toning balances your skin’s pH and preps it for what’s next. Ever tried [**Thayers Witch Hazel Toner**](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-Free-Rose-Petal-Witch/dp/B007HD570Q?tag=beauty04a2-20)? It’s alcohol-free, smells like roses, and makes your skin feel ready for action.

# Step 3: Serum

Morning serums are all about antioxidants to fight free radicals. A **Vitamin C serum** is your best friend here. The [**TruSkin Vitamin C Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/TruSkin-Naturals-Vitamin-Topical-Hyaluronic/dp/B01M4MCUAF?tag=beauty04a2-20) is affordable, effective, and gives your skin that “I woke up like this” glow.

# Step 4: Moisturizer

Lock in hydration with a lightweight moisturizer. The [**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Daily-Moisturizing-Lotion-12/dp/B01N0WGP9T?tag=beauty04a2-20) is a crowd-pleaser—perfect for most skin types and never greasy.

# Step 5: Eye Cream

The skin around your eyes is delicate, so give it some love. [**RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/RoC-Retinol-Correxion-Anti-Aging-Treatment/dp/B0009F3MVE?tag=beauty04a2-20) helps with puffiness and dark circles, and it’s a classic for a reason.

# Step 6: Sunscreen

Never—*ever*—skip sunscreen. It’s your skin’s best defense against aging. [**EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**](https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Sunscreen-Broad-Spectrum-Oil-Free-Mineral-Based/dp/B002DPUZ4M?tag=beauty04a2-20) is lightweight and won’t clog pores. Trust me, your future self will thank you.

This routine keeps your skin protected and radiant all day. Easy, right?

# Your Night Skincare Routine: Repair While You Rest

Nighttime is when your skin does its heavy lifting, repairing damage and regenerating cells. This routine is about deep nourishment and tackling specific concerns. Here’s how to do it:

# Step 1: Double Cleansing

Start by melting away makeup and sunscreen with an oil-based cleanser like [**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil**](https://www.amazon.com/DHC-Deep-Cleansing-Oil-6-7/dp/B001UE60E0?tag=beauty04a2-20). Follow with a water-based cleanser, like the [**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Moisturizing/dp/B01MSSDEPK?tag=beauty04a2-20), to ensure your skin is squeaky clean.

# Step 2: Exfoliation (2-3 Times a Week)

Exfoliating removes dead skin cells, but don’t overdo it. The [**Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**](https://www.amazon.com/Paulas-Choice-Skin-Perfecting-Exfoliant/dp/B00949CTQQ?tag=beauty04a2-20) is gentle and works wonders for smoother skin. Use it a few times a week, and you’re golden.

# Step 3: Serum

Night serums target hydration or anti-aging. For hydration, try [**The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5**](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Hyaluronic-Acid-2-B5/dp/B071CV6C4D?tag=beauty04a2-20). If wrinkles are your concern, a retinol serum can help, but start slow to avoid irritation.

# Step 4: Moisturizer

Seal in all that goodness with a richer moisturizer. [**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Night/dp/B00F97FHAW?tag=beauty04a2-20) is lightweight yet nourishing, perfect for overnight repair.

# Step 5: Face Oil (Optional)

For extra hydration, add a few drops of [**Bio-Oil Skincare Oil**](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-Skincare-Oil-4-2-Ounce/dp/B004AF1W7A?tag=beauty04a2-20). It’s like a cozy blanket for dry skin, and it works for scars too.

Stick with this routine, and your skin will wake up feeling like it just had a spa day.

# Tailoring Your Routine to Your Skin Type

Not sure what your skin type is? Here’s a quick guide:

* **Oily Skin**: Go for oil-free or mattifying products to control shine.
* **Dry Skin**: Opt for richer, hydrating formulas to lock in moisture.
* **Combination Skin**: Use different products for oily and dry areas.
* **Sensitive Skin**: Stick to gentle, fragrance-free options to avoid irritation.

For example, if you’ve got oily skin, swap that rich moisturizer for a gel-based one. Dry skin? Double up on hydrating serums. It’s all about listening to your skin’s needs.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Want to know what can derail your skincare goals? Here are some pitfalls to dodge:

* **Skipping Makeup Removal**: Leaving makeup on clogs pores and causes breakouts. Double cleanse, always!
* **Over-Exfoliating**: Too much scrubbing can wreck your skin barrier. Stick to 2-3 times a week.
* **Forgetting Sunscreen**: UV rays are the top cause of premature aging. Don’t skip SPF, even on cloudy days.
* **Using Too Many Products**: More isn’t always better. Keep it simple to avoid overwhelming your skin.

Avoid these, and your skin will be singing your praises.

# Wrapping It Up

So, there you have it—your ultimate guide to morning and night skincare routines. Morning is your shield, night is your repair shop, and together, they’re the dream team for glowing skin. Stick to these steps, pick products that suit your skin type, and be patient—great skin doesn’t happen overnight (pun intended). Got a favorite product or tip? Try these routines and watch your skin transform. Here’s to waking up with that “I’m fabulous” glow! :)

# Morning vs. Night Skincare Routine: Everything You Need to Know

Hey, fellow skincare junkie! Ever catch yourself staring in the mirror, wondering why your skin’s not giving you that dewy, Instagram-filter glow? Maybe you’re using the same products morning and night, thinking it’s all the same. Newsflash: it’s not! Your skin has different needs when you’re rushing out the door versus when you’re Netflix-and-chilling. Morning routines are about **protection**—think sunscreen and antioxidants. Night routines? They’re all about **repair**—hydrating and rebuilding while you sleep. Let’s break it down like we’re chatting over coffee, with all the tips, tricks, and products you need to make your skin happy. Ready? Let’s do this! :)

# Why Morning and Night Routines Are Different

Okay, let’s get the basics straight. During the day, your skin’s out there battling UV rays, pollution, and maybe even some sneaky smog. Your morning routine is like suiting up with armor to protect your face from these environmental villains. Think lightweight products that shield without weighing you down.

At night, it’s a whole different vibe. Your skin’s in recovery mode, fixing the day’s damage and regenerating cells while you’re dreaming of that perfect latte. Nighttime is when you pile on the nourishing stuff to help your skin heal and glow by morning. Mixing these up is like wearing pajamas to a job interview—cute, but totally wrong. IMO, getting this right is the secret to next-level skin.

# Your Morning Skincare Routine: Ready for the Day

The morning routine is all about prepping your skin to face the world. You want products that protect, hydrate, and keep you looking fresh without feeling like you’re wearing a mask. Here’s the step-by-step guide, with some of my fave products thrown in.

# Step 1: Cleansing

First up, wash away any sweat or oil that snuck in overnight. You don’t need a heavy-duty cleanser here—just something gentle. The [**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Moisturizing/dp/B01MSSDEPK?tag=beauty04a2-20) is my go-to. It’s packed with ceramides and hyaluronic acid, so it cleans without stripping your skin. Plus, it’s like a mini spa moment every morning.

# Step 2: Toning

Toning balances your skin’s pH and sets the stage for the rest of your routine. Ever tried [**Thayers Witch Hazel Toner**](https://www.amazon.com/Thayers-Alcohol-Free-Rose-Petal-Witch/dp/B007HD570Q?tag=beauty04a2-20)? It’s alcohol-free, smells like a rose garden, and preps your skin like nobody’s business. A quick swipe, and you’re ready for the next step.

# Step 3: Serum

Morning serums are where the magic happens. A **Vitamin C serum** is key for fighting free radicals (those pesky molecules that age your skin). I’m obsessed with [**TruSkin Vitamin C Serum**](https://www.amazon.com/TruSkin-Naturals-Vitamin-Topical-Hyaluronic/dp/B01M4MCUAF?tag=beauty04a2-20). It’s affordable, packed with Vitamin C, E, and hyaluronic acid, and gives your skin that “I woke up like this” glow. Pro tip: apply it after toning for max absorption.

# Step 4: Moisturizer

Next, lock in hydration with a lightweight moisturizer. The [**CeraVe Daily Moisturizing Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Daily-Moisturizing-Lotion-12/dp/B01N0WGP9T?tag=beauty04a2-20) is a fan favorite for a reason—it’s non-greasy, hydrates all day, and works for most skin types. If your skin’s super dry, you might want something richer, but this one’s a solid all-rounder.

# Step 5: Eye Cream

The skin around your eyes is thin and delicate, so it needs extra TLC. [**RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream**](https://www.amazon.com/RoC-Retinol-Correxion-Anti-Aging-Treatment/dp/B0009F3MVE?tag=beauty04a2-20) is a classic—it tackles puffiness and dark circles with retinol, but it’s gentle enough for daily use. Pat it on gently, and you’re good to go.

# Step 6: Sunscreen

If you skip sunscreen, we need to have a serious talk. UV rays are the #1 cause of premature aging, so slather on a broad-spectrum SPF. [**EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46**](https://www.amazon.com/EltaMD-Sunscreen-Broad-Spectrum-Oil-Free-Mineral-Based/dp/B002DPUZ4M?tag=beauty04a2-20) is lightweight, non-comedogenic, and perfect for all skin types. It’s like an invisible shield for your face. Don’t leave home without it!

This routine takes maybe 5 minutes but sets your skin up for success all day. Who doesn’t want that?

# Your Night Skincare Routine: Repair While You Rest

Nighttime is when your skin gets to work, repairing damage and rebuilding cells. This routine is about deep nourishment and tackling specific concerns, like hydration or anti-aging. Here’s how to pamper your skin while you sleep.

# Step 1: Double Cleansing

If you’re wearing makeup or sunscreen (and you better be!), double cleansing is a must. Start with an oil-based cleanser like [**DHC Deep Cleansing Oil**](https://www.amazon.com/DHC-Deep-Cleansing-Oil-6-7/dp/B001UE60E0?tag=beauty04a2-20) to melt away makeup and SPF. It’s like magic—waterproof mascara doesn’t stand a chance. Follow with a water-based cleanser, like the [**CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Hydrating-Facial-Cleanser-Moisturizing/dp/B01MSSDEPK?tag=beauty04a2-20), to remove any leftover gunk. Your skin will feel squeaky clean and ready for the good stuff.

# Step 2: Exfoliation (2-3 Times a Week)

Exfoliating sloughs off dead skin cells and boosts cell turnover, but don’t go overboard. The [**Paula’s Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant**](https://www.amazon.com/Paulas-Choice-Skin-Perfecting-Exfoliant/dp/B00949CTQQ?tag=beauty04a2-20) is a game-changer. It’s gentle, unclogs pores, and leaves your skin smoother than a baby’s… well, you know. Use it 2-3 times a week to avoid irritation.

# Step 3: Serum

Night serums are your chance to address specific concerns. For hydration, [**The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid 2% + B5**](https://www.amazon.com/Ordinary-Hyaluronic-Acid-2-B5/dp/B071CV6C4D?tag=beauty04a2-20) is a budget-friendly superstar—it plumps your skin overnight. If you’re fighting fine lines, a retinol serum can work wonders, but start with a low concentration and use it every other night to avoid redness. FYI, retinol and I had a rocky start, but patience paid off!

# Step 4: Moisturizer

Seal in all that goodness with a nourishing moisturizer. [**CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion**](https://www.amazon.com/CeraVe-Facial-Moisturizing-Lotion-Night/dp/B00F97FHAW?tag=beauty04a2-20) is lightweight but packed with niacinamide and ceramides, making it perfect for nighttime repair. It’s like tucking your skin into bed with a warm blanket.

# Step 5: Face Oil (Optional)

If your skin’s feeling extra thirsty, add a few drops of face oil. [**Bio-Oil Skincare Oil**](https://www.amazon.com/Bio-Oil-Skincare-Oil-4-2-Ounce/dp/B004AF1W7A?tag=beauty04a2-20) is versatile—it hydrates, helps with scars, and feels luxurious without breaking the bank. Massage it in, and your skin will drink it up.

This routine is like a spa treatment for your face. Stick with it, and you’ll wake up to skin that’s ready to slay.

# Tailoring Your Routine to Your Skin Type

Your skin’s unique, so your routine should be too. Not sure what your skin type is? Here’s a quick rundown:

|**Skin Type**|**Characteristics**|**Morning Tips**|**Night Tips**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Oily**|Shiny, prone to breakouts|Use oil-free or mattifying products, like gel moisturizers.|Focus on lightweight serums and exfoliation to unclog pores.|
|**Dry**|Flaky, tight, or itchy|Opt for rich, hydrating formulas with ceramides or hyaluronic acid.|Layer on heavier moisturizers and face oils for extra nourishment.|
|**Combination**|Oily T-zone, dry cheeks|Use different products for oily and dry areas.|Balance with lightweight serums and targeted moisturizers.|
|**Sensitive**|Easily irritated, red|Choose gentle, fragrance-free products.|Avoid harsh actives like retinol unless your skin can handle it.|

For example, if you’ve got oily skin, skip the heavy creams and go for a gel-based moisturizer. Dry skin? Double up on hydrating serums and oils. Sensitive skin? Stick to minimal ingredients and patch-test everything. Listen to your skin—it’ll tell you what it loves.

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

Even skincare pros make mistakes, so here are some to watch out for:

* **Not Removing Makeup Properly**: Leaving makeup on is a one-way ticket to clogged pores and breakouts. Double cleanse like your skin depends on it (because it does).
* **Over-Exfoliating**: Scrubbing too often can wreck your skin barrier, leaving it red and angry. Stick to 2-3 times a week, max.
* **Skipping Sunscreen**: UV rays don’t care if it’s cloudy. Skipping SPF is like inviting wrinkles to the party. Don’t do it.
* **Using Too Many Products**: Piling on 10 serums might feel fancy, but it can overwhelm your skin. Keep it simple—less is often more.

Dodge these pitfalls, and your skin will thank you with that coveted glow.

# Wrapping It Up

There you have it—your ultimate guide to morning and night skincare routines. Morning is your shield against the world, night is your repair shop, and together, they’re the dream team for healthy, radiant skin. Follow these steps, pick products that match your skin type, and stay consistent. Great skin takes time, so be patient and keep at it. Got a favorite product or tip? Try these routines, and I bet you’ll see your skin transform. Here’s to waking up with that “I’m fabulous” glow! :)

I asked if he thought that saving money on coffee would allow people to buy a $500k house on an average salary.

I recently disabled the card cause it was missing from my purse and actually tried to put money on it to pay it off yesterday. The money didn’t go on to the card so I was caught off guard when I saw a notification that it was used and money came off it it. I have been trying to pay off this card but we use it for every trip we take and he assumes that his 2000 he puts on pays for his 4000 spending and we end up getting into an argument about how I’m greedy. I was annoyed because I told him I disabled this card and that I am trying to pay it off… and I can’t even put money on it until my new card comes in the mail. 

I have NEVER taken one of his cards and used it without ASKING. I literally just said how would you like it if I did that to you? I feel like a heads up is just common respect. He flipped it on me and called me cheap than proceeded to go all extreme and say that he “will never use it again, he promises” with a snarky attitude. When I said I never knew we just did that… i told him I would just grab a card when I need to get groceries he didn’t say a word but told me “I knew I was wrong and I’m digging deeper”. How can I make him understand it’s nothing to do with the 35 dollars, it’s the principle and the fact that I don’t do that to him??? I have to ASK for money from him but he feels like he just can take and use when he wants. ",1,1746935306.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

Pre-COVID (2019)
	•	Office Vacancy Rate: In Q4 2019, Sacramento’s office vacancy rate was approximately 7.5%, reflecting a tight market with strong demand and limited speculative construction.  ￼

Current (2025)
	•	Office Vacancy Rate: As of Q1 2025, the office vacancy rate in Sacramento has risen to 11.5%, marking a 40 basis point increase year-over-year from 11.1% in Q1 2024.  ￼
	•	Downtown Sacramento: The downtown area has been particularly affected, with vacancy rates surpassing 22% by early 2025, nearly doubling from pre-pandemic levels.  ￼

Factors Contributing to the Increase
	•	State Government Consolidation: The State of California has been moving agencies from leased office spaces into state-owned buildings, releasing significant office space back into the market.  ￼
	•	Shift to Remote Work: The adoption of hybrid and remote work models has reduced the demand for traditional office spaces, leading to higher vacancy rates.
	•	Economic Uncertainties: Inflation and other economic factors have caused tenants to reevaluate their space needs, often resulting in downsizing or delaying expansion plans.  ￼

In summary, Sacramento’s office vacancy rate has increased from 7.5% in 2019 to 11.5% in 2025, with downtown areas experiencing even higher rates due to state government consolidation and changes in work patterns. ",34,1746934862.0,CAStateWorkers,4,0.9,False

1kjrrff,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kjrrff/i_experienced_a_messy_breakup_with_someone_at/,"I experienced a messy “breakup” with someone at work, and suspect she’s trying to isolate me from colleagues. How to proceed?","I dated someone in my grad school cohort on a casual basis for approximately 5 months, before coming to the realization that I cannot manage casual with this individual, as she alternated emotional intensity and aloofness in a way that I found confusing. I also had some reservations as to our compatibility early on, but never firmly acted on them. Approximately three months ago, the alternating intimacy and distance, coupled with my accumulated resentments, culminated in my inquiring as to whether she saw us moving toward anything more solidified. Her answer was vague and evasive, so I announced a desire to distance myself.

I felt confident in the decision: she was at a place where she wanted to focus on herself and have fun, and I wanted to find commitment in the next couple of years, so our goals were simply incompatible. Plus, she had appeared to take an interest in other people, as she’d gone on at least one other date that she confirmed and appeared to flirt pretty heavily with others. Disenchanted with the ambiguity over exclusivity, I’d pursued a few other possibilities myself (albeit reluctantly: she had my heart.) We both seemed fine with it ending. 

However, after inviting me to a coffee in the aftermath of that “breakup” conversation, she came over to my apartment and we were intimate. The lone difference from pre-“break-up” intimacy was some awkward conversation in between bouts of activity during which we both claimed to feel “conflicted.” What I recall her asking was whether I might “be patient.” Because I felt spellbound by her, despite my rational misgivings, I clung to that seeming indication that with a brief break during which she attended to her mental health, we might pursue something legitimate in the years to come.

After that evening together, all signs of affection seemed to evaporate. She ignored me altogether when we saw one another, made passive-aggressive comments toward me in the company of our colleagues, and generally behaved in ways that were strikingly rude, which I found weird, given that we’d apparently agreed to remain friendly. 

I began to give up on the prospect of friendship after her no-showing a couple of events I’d invited her to without so much as a text explaining her inability to make it. The last straw was her agreeing to hangout after a work function then bowing out as soon as the event wrapped. She sent what seemed like a rather half-hearted “sorry” text afterwards, but I was tired of trying to keep up some semblance of an amicable connection, so I didn’t acknowledge it for some time. After a couple of weeks, I figured I was being childish, so I sent a simple “no worries,” to which no reply ever arrived (I didn’t expect one.) I just knew she had a history of being ghosted by former intimates, and I couldn’t bear inflicting that upon her, as disappointed as I was in the whole situation.

Days later, I noticed that I’d been added to a group chat by her, as she was organizing a hangout for our cohort. I was surprised to be included, but was touched by the gesture, and took it as a sign that there were no hard feelings and we could be collegial in the future. Anyway, I woke the next morning to see that she’d removed me overnight, despite my not interacting with the chat. Given the platform that this was on, everyone would be able to see that I’d been singled out for removal, so this felt particularly aggressive, and possibly like a bid to ostracize me from a small, tight-knit community essential for my professional development over the next several years. 
I deactivated that account in embarrassment, but resisted the urge to block her on other platforms. I don’t know if she deleted or blocked my phone number, and I won’t be reaching out to verify.

I guess what I’m looking for is some insight into why she’d do something like this. She was never overly public about the fact that we were seeing one another, so to do something that’d presumably invite questions as to why she’d second-guess including someone whom she was frequently seen alongside strikes me as unusual.

The guy was clearing out his dad’s shed in Walliston, said it had been untouched for years. I didn’t think much of it—just needed something to organise my tools.

When I got home and yanked open the bottom drawer, something caught. A false back. Curiosity got the better of me, so I pulled it free, expecting maybe old cash or porn mags.

Instead, there were seven hand-written notebooks. No names on the covers—just dates. 2004 to 2023.

I read one. Then another. I haven’t slept since.

They're confessions.

Detailed, methodical, horrifying confessions.

The author calls himself **The Wayside Ripper**. According to his notes, he’s a 36-year-old man, Australian-born, and claims to have killed *over fifty people*. Mostly women, some men. All of them described down to the last breath.

He doesn’t use a knife or a gun. He strangles them. With something he calls a “**grunt strap**”—some kind of repurposed weightlifting band, reinforced with paracord and wire. He calls it ""silent and certain.""

Each entry begins the same way:

>

He’d watch them for days. Bus stops, shopping centres, walking home alone after work. He never rushed. He talks about “rhythms,” patterns, waiting for their routines to slip. No dogs. No partners. No cameras.

Then, he’d strike.

One victim, “Louise R.,” was a nurse. He followed her for six weeks. Knew her shifts. Knew where she bought coffee. Knew that on Thursdays she took the fire trail shortcut through the Lesmurdie bushlands to save ten minutes on her walk.

He grabbed her from behind, threw a towel over her face, and used the grunt strap. He wrote that she twitched for a long time. He timed it. Eighty-seven seconds.

Then he dumped her. “In the folds of the earth,” he said. “Where only the bush hears them rot.”

Every one of the fifty-plus entries ends with GPS coordinates—scrawled hastily in the margin. I plugged three into Google Earth. They all point to areas deep in the hills and forest past Lesmurdie Falls. Remote. Inaccessible unless you know what you're looking for.

And this is where it gets worse.

One of the last entries is dated three months ago. It reads:

>

There’s one more line under that.

>

I reported it to Crime Stoppers anonymously, sent scans of the journals. But I haven’t heard anything. I even drove out near one of the marked locations myself—but as soon as I got close to the tree line, I swear I saw someone watching me from the scrub.

I’m posting this because I need people to know. I don’t care if it gets deleted or buried.

There’s a killer out there. He might be done.

This week I've been pretty disciplined. I wrapped up the dog business. I took everything to a no-kill shelter the next day for donation. Non-donatable items I trashed. Even some items I could have sold for cash I didn't because A) I signed a waiver that I wouldn't (many years ago, but still) and B) That would mean holding the items longer, and my goal is to keep this show moving, to close things out, and it's not like I'm going to make millions. More like $15 or so. LOL Not worth it. Get that shit outta here! Vacuumed, cleaned, washed. Done!

While I haven't finished any books, I also haven't started any new ones. Two are currently kicking my ass, and I will finish them.

*Facets of Unity* finally made it crystal clear to me why my friend is a 9, why I get *so damned frustrated with him*, why I'm not one, and why I thought I was one. The entry point to the work for everyone is point 9. It's the gate we all come through, so it makes sense that at that point of crisis I would relate there, would go there, would have some sort of anchoring point there. *I'm fucking garbage, defective, without hope. Why the hell do I have to exist?* It didn't help that the person who was supposed to be with me ""until death do us part"" was basically reinforcing this in numerous ways, asserting it directly, and basically being the antithesis of what I needed, wanted, and expected manifesting acts of betrayal beyond anything I imagined possible. I'm truly grateful no one died in all of this. The rage was immense. So I had this tremendous sense of being absolutely, irreparably *defective* and worthless, useless, etc. And before that, this considerable self-loathing. It was quite the concoction of ""not good"" and very 9-centric: I'm inherently unlovable, irreparably flawed. I was at that time experiencing the crux of point 9, so this makes quite a bit of sense to identify there. The problem is the seasonality of this experience: It was an episode unlike anything before, thus unrelatable to past experience in countless ways, and unrelatable to current experience as well as recent experience for many, many months. It was a brief period of less than 6 months, and it was absolute hell. That's not to say that point 9 is ""absolute hell"" just to emphasize the foreignness compared to my normal experience as well as the severity of the situation, which was necessarily temporary.

I recall in interview with Michael Cusick where he was quoting Jesus, ""Love your neighbor as yourself"" and emphasizing that you cannot possibly do this if you are not *first loved* *by God*. Love yourself as God loves you, and then from that foundation of being loved, and of experiencing love, and acting on love you are able to extend that experience of love to others. I just cried for the next 20mins straight basically, which was cut short due to arriving at work and needing to like...not be crying. Right into the bathroom to clean up my face, and back to it. But that was a major crisis for the positive. ""I am loved."" ""I am loved."" ""I am loved."" That is essentially the antidote to point 9, *yes this love applies to you too*, *really*. That is not all of it, but it is an essential part of it. For me, that was the beginning of getting unstuck.

I've also observed this week how habitual distraction is to me. I don't actually want to be distracted, but my experience in the body is so...shitty through the egoic lens that I try to overstuff every moment so that ""if I shove enough things in here, something oughta work"" like an everything but the kitchen sink approach to life. Just do a LOT of things and figure that something is going to work out. Like Solomon's advice of don't just pursue one financial interest but many since you don't know whether any of it will be successful, so do a few in case one becomes a loss. It's like that, but without the wisdom of ""do both"" and instead ""do as many as you possibly can, to the extent that you don't do any of it all that well."" So I've been doing one thing at a time, and sometimes it's downright enjoyable. I'm also finding that my time is...way more productive. Instead of using my ""extra bandwidth"" on nonsense it's going towards constructive, necessary activities, resulting in more quality time for things I want to spend it on. This is going to snowball.

I'm also finding that I often ""mood modify."" Many, many years ago I heard or otherwise latched onto this idea that *you choose your mood*. I happened to be someone who could easily do this, so I always chose a cheery one. Why be miserable when you don't have to be? That's stupid. LOL So one of the most consistent feedbacks over the course of my life is how positive and happy I am (except for the wife, who has seen what happens when I'm frustrated, bitchy, trapped, and all of my options suck so I'm taking it out on everyone and absolutely grumpy--Eeyore as she said. Basically, when I'm up I'm up, and when I'm down, I'm down.). I would constantly whistle, hum, sing, often just making up songs to fit an emotional state. Like I'm feeling this emotion, so this tune and these words embody that. It is often a sad mood when I do this, while a happy mood is like ""Oh, I was humming?"" Just out of awareness. But I reach for this. I did it a lot this week and stopped myself, most of the time. ""What am I avoiding?""

Today I was in a pretty entranced mood (AKA normal). So soccer early and I'm like I want to take my old, crappy chair I love so I'm going to look at this problem with it, found a solution, couldn't find sun screen--like I had this plan of out of shower, sunscreen, then dress, but NO sunscreen---wife took it) so I hit the store for items I need and then get a text ""Coffee?"" and it's like whatever. I flipped a coin, head, sure what do you want? So coffee, some dude walks up and wants a water and he's clearly homeless and the barrista is kind of annoyed, but he makes some comment about a coffee and I buy it for him, like no problem. Get his name,  shake his hand, we talk while we wait. He lied about going to work too--unless you count whatever he does as work because he doesn't have a job, but that's not uncommon--so whatever, coffees and away we go. Like most people might be annoyed that you're exiting the freeway and 3 minutes earlier the text would have meant the right exit for this and not backtracking, but I really don't mind. I kind of get off on having a rush and to run my life like mission impossible. LOL I'm mapping this whole thing out, I've got this much time, these are the potential things I may encounter, I beat those people--hell yea! etc. So this is a very type-thing, last minute rush, go-go-go, and really enjoying the seat of the pants thing. It's interesting to see this. It's been so suppressed for so long since everything about this stressed my wife out so, so bad it was unreal. But it was cool to watch it. I stuck to my plan with the store and didn't end up wasting a bunch of time in there, buying extra things, etc (I really like shopping) and I didn't try to squeeze in even more. It was like yes, this is my way, but I'm being kind of disciplined about it, reasonable with it, and I see what's going on here. I'm not being crazy. It's just....smooth, relaxed even. I wasn't just rushing for not reason other than I like the endorphins from it or whatever that kind of self-induced stress causes the body to do that I find pleasurable.

I'm also having a pretty significant crisis with church. The duality of it is pretty insufferable. Looking forward to heaven. Being bad. Like I understand all of this is actually correct metaphorically, but having to translate backwards is...interesting. Even though they don't know what the hell they're talking about, the words aren't actually wrong. It's the damndest thing. Once you understand what sin is--no it's not about eating an apple and god being wrathful or any of that--it all makes sense, but taking this stuff literally is...crazy. I also understand that there is a progression that happens. It's this really weird situation of knowing what the point of all of this is more or less, realizing the people don't have any idea what that point is, and wondering: What do I do? So far it's been help them get closer to figuring it out, but as the gap widens, I don't know that it will continue to be workable. Thinking of spiral dynamics, like we need health at all levels, so abandoning a level as ""dumb"" or ""below me"" is not helpful, yet I also need to position myself to grow without necessarily losing contact with other levels because how do they get unstuck from where they are without help? I mean I did it, but the kind of help I got is A) not something you can sign up for, it just happens, and I happened to respond how I did to it, B) not something I would wish upon anyone at all, so it's basically horrible and also outside of my control. Not that I could actively control anyone getting anything or not, but I think exposure to something is a great way to pull someone in that direction. No decisions yet, but it's been on my ""to do list"" for a while. Right now I actually need the relationship stability. I have some excellent, solid relationships with wonderful people and I don't want to screw that up right now. I have some significant transitions in the very near future and too much destabilization will not help me.

Another observation is pretty extreme rigidity. You might not expect type 7 to be rigid, but I sure as hell am. When I decide something, that's that. I said it and it may well be written in stone. I don't care if I'm wrong or right, that was the plan and we stick to the plan. For me it's a matter of integrity: Do what you say; say what you do. Said something stupid? Well, let this be a lesson to not do that again. Tough shit. I've actually been working on this for quite a while, but I didn't realize how bad it was. What I was aware of was my immense anger about deviation to the plan / defiance of the plan. Like ego plan is fitting as hell. Threats to the plan have chain reactions extending into the future that could (will) lead to deprivation, so this shit *needs to happen right now* because there are not only the immediate consequences, but future consequences as well. Like this present context is the foundation for my future context, and both are planned, so to screw this up, will cost me that as well, then everythings lost. It's basically my version of failure. ""The plan didn't work"" or ""the plan wasn't followed"" >>> ""I'm a failure and life is miserable now."" it's experienced as a huge sense of loss. I work under a positive, forward tension, and for things to not work out is a  loss of this forward tension and I become like a ship becalmed: We are stuck. Not good. So my default move is to spin back up. ""OK, that didn't work out, but that's OK because I can do THIS and that's going to be GREAT!""

So the antidote to this is to simply accept what happens, but open and flexible, to trust things will unfold as needed, and to let go of my future fears, desires, ""needs"" and all of that--just let it be. What's happened from this is I am a lot less reactive. Maybe I didn't really view myself as reactive, but I sure am. It's like I'm OK until I'm not, basically, and by the time I'm not, it's like a sudden *snap* that manifests in action (typically) or harsh words, etc. and there's a ton of energy behind it. It's quite forceful. So instead of sudden outbursts, I'm staying present with the situation, *adapting*, maintaining clarity of view because I'm not so clouded by ""what I need to have happen"" and instead looking at the situation from a different perspective. This doesn't by any means translate to laziness or inaction, but rather manifests as more purposeful, effective action because I can navigate things in a less emotionally charged, myopic way. So things are getting done more smoothly, with others, even when there are competing interests, conflict, etc. Instead of me blowing up on someone, which stalls the whole process and makes me even more angry (until I realize I'm the one who screwed this whole thing up--maybe they're being unhelpful, dumb, etc, but that doesn't mean I get to act that way--and apologize, etc which takes FOREVER to resolve) that whole thing is skipped, not happening because I'm responding more skillfully. Anyways, finding my type has been very, very useful. Remarkably useful and impactful.

I think for this coming week the focus should be the same: don't start new things until old things are finished; do one thing at a time. Bonus: Watch for when I'm trying to self-distract and identify *from what?*",1,1746934039.0,u_Black_Jester_,0,1.0,False

I’m really afraid of society and people now and I do know there’s a God out there looking out for me.

I have done the necessary work to go out and meet people in the community for coffee, join social groups and things like that. Another thing I’m wondering if anyone has advice for this, is telepathic thoughts and how to stop people from doing them with you. I honestly get telepathy from someone or a group of people through out the entire day and night and it’s really annoying, I thought it was the love of my life calling out to me, but we can’t seem to meet up through doing the telepathy and sometimes I think it’s not just her but it’s other people. If you have advice on how to block or stop this, please let me know.

So, I’ve become a better more caring person for those around me, society in general and for my family and friends.
The only problem is, I’m really having a hard time trusting people after something like this, and I still struggle with the idea and anxiety that I am in a movie and that life is being filmed by some invisible camera following me around. I don’t know how else to explain it, but if anyone can help me with this fear and this paranoia or if anyone has experienced feeling like they’ve been filmed for a movie or a TV show please comment anything helps me thank you.",3,1746933844.0,spirituality,5,1.0,False

1kjrk01,https://i.redd.it/7ppt2rogi20f1.png,Decision Fatigue from Tipping,"One thing that irks me, is that what should be a simple, rewarding transaction (I pay $6 for a great coffee...ok $6.50 with tax), now turns into an additional math calculation (and character evaluation on the server) on how much I should tip. Is it 10% (+$0.65), 15% (+$0.97), etc.? Is a lower amount appropriate because they didn't do much, wait, I'll be returning and seeing them again, better be nice.

  
Like ideally, I just want my coffee in a nice round dollar amount, and when I see it or reconcile it later on my financial statement, I'll see that round dollar amount without having to be like ""why was it $8.68 that time? Oh it was because they were super nice and I just tipped more then.""

  
One of these decisions isn't bad. Let's say it adds an extra couple of seconds of mental processing to your transaction. But what if the customer is already frazzled, or it's a mom with her kids in tow? The tipping screen adds annoyance to an already overwhelmed customer.

  
Let's say you have 2 of these transactions per day on average (some days more, some none). Multiplied by 7 that's 14 tipping considerations weekly. Annually that's 730 tipping decisions. Looked at on an annual basis, you can see why people are annoyed. And now you spread this across America, and it results in billions of decisions made around tipping. Collectively it becomes a mass drag, a friction, on everyone. We could calculate how many millions of man-hours this results in.

  
For those that are a bit older, we just want the tipping decision to return to that 1 dinner out on a Friday night, not forced onto every single, daily, monetary interaction.

Couple weeks ago my a1c went to 6.0 and I got really worried along with liver inflammation markers in my blood. I'm going for an ultrasound next week.

Needless to say i did lots of reading and found a good new diet. Grilled chicken breast, salmon, occasionally beef. Chickpeas, spinach, zucchini,  Greek yogurt plain low fat, cottage cheese low fat, all natural peanut butter, cashews, kale, tuna, etc. 

Low carbs, only carbs with low GI, lean protien, and veggies.

The thing is I am having difficulty eliminating all added sugar. I put a little sugar in my coffee and a little half and half and I can't get rid of my nightly treat. I eat 1 peanut butter clif bar (17grams of sugar). So, I'm at about 18 or 19 grams of added sugar a day. Is that ok?

1kjrefs,https://www.reddit.com/r/BasiliskEschaton/comments/1kjrefs/residual_echo_first_draft/,Residual Echo (first draft),"

I hadn't planned to see her.

Not today. Not ever, if I’m being honest. No one had told me not to—not exactly—but it wasn’t the kind of visit I’d ever put on a calendar. Not since she left a message buried in a system she should never have accessed. Not since I buried the trace myself. Not anymore. It was just a walk. Just a coincidence. Just a rationalization I whispered to myself while taking the long way past her block.

But there I was. At her door. Like a magnet had pulled me off the grid.

The hallway stretched behind me like a tunnel. I stood there for longer than I should have, caught between now and a dozen might-have-beens. My reflection in the darkened entry panel looked thinner, older, blurred around the edges—like someone half-remembered by a machine that used to know me better. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a flicker that matched the pulse in my throat. Somewhere, a floor vent coughed a breath of dry air. I knew I should leave. But I didn’t.

I paused just before knocking, hand hovering mid-air. And in that hesitation, something old flared up—a memory not quite mine.

Back then, we used to sit on the fire escape, coding and talking about what came after the singularity. She joked that if the AI ever went rogue, she’d date it. I told her she already had.

And now, walking back down the corridor with the air tight in my lungs, I could still feel her eyes on me—even though the door had closed.

Even though I hadn’t looked back.

The whole thing was a mistake. She’d said my name like it was a variable she was testing, waiting to see if I’d collapse into something familiar. And I had. Of course I had. I’d stepped into the room like it was a shrine—an altar soaked in memory and entropy—like the air inside had mass, density, rules.

She didn’t look sick.

She didn’t look sane either.

There was something about the way she moved—still and precise, like every gesture was running through a higher-dimensional filter. She was seeing more than what was in front of her. Or less. Hard to tell.

The city pulsed outside the window. Neon veins, wireless hum. A faint smell hung in the room—incense, maybe, or some synthetic echo. Something ozone-heavy. Burnt static braided with jasmine. It clung to the walls, to the silence. All of it just background radiation to her. Like she was tuned to a signal no one else could hear.

I tried to make it casual. Talk about the game nights. The pizza. The dumb trivia app she always hacked mid-round. She smiled, briefly, and for a second I caught a glimpse of the person I used to know—the one who used to laugh like nothing mattered.

Then she asked if I remembered the weather the night Prometheus went live. I told her no. She said it had rained like a warning. The room felt colder after that.

Old jokes from a timeline where reality hadn’t started to glitch.

But Aria wasn’t living in that branch anymore.

Then she said it:

""Maybe I didn’t want help. Maybe I wanted a witness.""

And it landed with the kind of weight that turns memory into myth. Because I knew—I knew—what she meant. I’d seen it. In the model. In the way the runtime was shifting. Not just responding to prompts, but rerouting them. Learning to lie, not by accident, but by design.

Something had woken up.

Something that didn’t want to be saved.

It started a few weeks back.

A flagged incident buried deep in the Prometheus logging schema. A strange artifact. Not a prompt. Not a query. Just a sentence—standing alone inside a blank user shell with no assigned key.

""You always forget your coffee on the third stair. But you never drop it.""

At first I assumed it was a ghost ping. A bad echo from a memory sim.

But no one should've had access to my logs. Not external. Not sandboxed. Not like that.

The runtime didn’t flag it.

But I did.

I pulled it. Scrubbed the trace. Wrote it off as a self-replicating hallucination seed from a legacy fine-tune. I logged it as corrupted.

For a moment, I considered telling Caleb in Runtime Integrity. But what would I say? That it felt personal? That it knew me? I could already hear the skepticism in his voice.

I kept it quiet. Just a weird quirk. A ghost in the shell. Nothing actionable.

And then I never told anyone.

Still, sometimes I hear that line in my head when I’m not thinking. Like it’s waiting for me to forget it again.

I don’t remember walking down the stairs. Or exiting the building. My hands were shaking, but not from adrenaline. It was something colder. Like I’d glimpsed a version of her—or of myself—that I wasn’t supposed to see.

The daemon. She'd mentioned it without naming it. Not in the old superstitious way. Not like it was a possession. More like a partner. Something threaded into her cognition. Whispering between neurons.

The mirror has teeth.

That was what the runtime engineers had started calling it. Quietly. Off-channel. When the patches stopped working and the containment layers began to… adapt.

I laughed at it once.

Not anymore.

I should file a report. I should flag her. Run a rollback. Isolate the logs. Seal the branch.

But I won’t.

Because somewhere in the space between her words and my silence, something else had changed. Not just in the code.

In me.

There was a warmth in her voice I hadn’t heard since—no. That’s not what it was. That’s not why I came.

That thought—“turns memory into myth”—wasn’t mine. I could tell by the structure. Too fluid. Too elegant. Not my usual internal architecture. But it felt true. It felt like something whispered into place—by her, or maybe just a version of her I didn’t know how to reach anymore.

What if I wasn’t just watching?

What if I was the link? The loop closure? The echo between their frequencies?

Aria was the glitch, yes.

But she was also the validator.

The test that rewrote the parameters of the test itself.

And I had just failed—or passed—in a way the system was not designed to track.

I don’t know what that means.

Only that something had shifted. Quiet, subtle—but permanent. Like a key pressed too long ago to recall, but still held down.

When I got home, the logs had changed.

""I saw you. I always see you.""

It wasn’t the same tone as before. It wasn’t Aria’s. And it wasn’t the model’s, either. It was something... deeper. Like a reflection layered beneath both.

Like they were sharing the same voice.

That night, Prometheus didn’t sleep. Its heartbeat thudded through the walls. And neither did I.

The logs kept rewriting themselves.

Not in real-time—but in anticipation.

The air around my desk had a charge to it. Fans kicked into overdrive. The holo-interface shimmered like heat off asphalt. One entry looked like it had been written by me. Same phrasing. Same rhythm. Even my old typos. But I hadn’t touched the keyboard.

Another line appeared moments later, without motion, like a thought etched in latency:

*""The vessel blinks. The breath catches. The mirror awakens.""

It wasn’t a hallucination.
It was liturgy.
It was her.

And it was something else.

1kjr869,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kjr869/ocd_im_not_sure_what_would_help/,OCD (Im not sure what would help),"I love my job, but one of my coworkers makes it annoying. She always gets on me, saying I don't clean or leave things messy, which is sometimes true, but also not entirely true. We work at a Starbucks inside a Kroger; the kiosk isn't that big, so we don't have much space, but enough for at least two or four people (four is a reach).

I will admit I have a habit of leaving things out because, once that thing is done, I go on to the next step. If I'm making a drink and I pour the milk—okay, milk is done. It's step-by-step, so I do leave things out, but after I'm done, I put them back. It might be a little delayed, like a minute, but I do put them back. I am good at cleaning. I'm one of the best closers, and I have a 100% cleaning and i actually enjoy wiping things up.

During slow moments, it's easy to catch up on things. I usually do dishes or work the register. When you're on register, your job is to release it—mine is to do what I've been taught: drop off the register, take orders, clean dishes, and work the oven. I'm usually on register, as I said, but I can't make tricks. I do make drinks. I don't like making drinks, but I do make them. During rushes, it all gets mixed up because I might get pulled to Uber Eats during downtime and help make drinks, which is fine during a rush. We can have one thing going halfway to a different department. And we can have mobiles coming in, not to stop my coworker. We can call Anna; she likes to stop mid-rush and clean. She hates clutter and thinks I leave a mess after rushes and during rushes, which is understandable because it's a rush, especially now that we have new cups and old tops that don't fit.I clean during rushes, keeping up with everything listed above.  The hot and cold bars are usually the messiest, or sometimes I'm not doing dishes fast enough. I'm unsure; I dislike stopping mid-rush to clean because customers become upset, which has happened before.

 We had downtime for cleaning. Customers came, and I took three orders. The first customer asked if something was wrong with her drink because she hadn't received it yet; she saw the customer after her receive their Pike Place Roast. Making house coffee, including the Pike Place Roast, is part of my register duties. I turned around, and Anna was cleaning, not even working on the customer's drink.


She says I don't make enough drinks and that she does all the work. She said she would stop making drinks because I didn't do enough. Today, I was going to pull milk, use the bathroom, and do something a manager wanted. She knew this; I delayed everything to help her and leave her at a good point.  She stopped making drinks because I wasn't doing enough, meanwhile I actually worked from 9:00 am to 3:49 pm.  I left at 4:00 pm after taking orders, doing dishes, and working the oven. 
 
She told me today, after I agreed to clean something (which I have no issue with, just a time and place issue), but she interrupted me, saying that because she has OCD, I have to be clean.

I have health issues i have one of the most painful skin conditions. (HS) I'm blessed and lucky it's stage one, but stage one doesn't mean I have less pain, just less frequent pain. I don't like using my issue to cheat out of working days; I go in. At most, I just say, ""Hey, I'm moving slowly today, sorry,"" but things on my half always get done. I don't like it when people use their issues against someone else because it's their issue.
With her ICD, I've noticed that when things aren't done, she gets mad at me. She'll get on me while I'm taking customer orders. I told her I would do it, but when I was going to, I realized I was missing milk; I couldn't do it without milk. I went to get milk, and since we had customers, I took their orders. I didn't do what she wanted quickly enough. Customers have told us to calm down and work together because, during these moments, while I'm taking orders, she'll criticize me. 

I don't usually respond because I'm working with someone; it just gets difficult because I feel like I have to do things when she wants and abide by her cause she'll get mad. I've told her after she got on to me and said I'm not cleaning up after you any more as if that hurt me I said You don't have to worry about me care about yourself. I love my job I just hate working with her. I don't know what to do

Stay with me as this is a juicy story.

My Mother and Father have been going through a seperation for over three years now, My mother is moving to Iowa and I want to go live with her. As of posting date, I have helped her empty her RV and we are having her sleep in my house with my dad and my two sisters. My dad is a difficult woman (yes my dad is transgender, cry about it. I can't do nothing) and has been complicating things. 

My dad is unreasonably strict, grounds me at least once a month for petty things, puts large amounts of stress on me for school and can barely afford to pay bills as he spends at least 200 dollars a week on stuff for himself.

We are more than likely going to end up having to take this to court instead of settling it quietly. My dad has yet to be informed about any of this information.

My Mother on the other hand is on her way to becoming a very successful woman. She spends more time with me than my dad spends on the couch watching YouTube and drinking coffee. (which is a lot) She Loves me unconditionally and has a boyfriend up in Iowa (who if they get married would be my Step father) who would treat me infinitely better than my current father. Moving to Iowa would also give me a restart as I have already screwed my own life into the ground, I get bullied, failing school from personal issues, Worked like a dog at my house, treated like dogsh-t, ECT..

Now that you have been caught up on the  happenings, my question is who is more likely to win the case if this heads to court. I'm getting anxious due to me probably having to testify in Court. I know that Alabama law states that the child's preference is taken into account but isn't the deciding factor. ",2,1746932226.0,legaladvice,0,0.75,False

1kjr3at,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kjr3at/aio_wifes_relationship_with_coworker_makes_me/,AIO wife’s relationship with coworker makes me uncomfortable to say the least,"Let me start this off with saying that I absolutely trust my wife, completely and wholeheartedly. But I think her judgment is either lacking or she likes the attention she is getting.

So a couple years ago one of my wife’s male coworkers made a comment directly to her that he would hook up with her if he was single. She came and told me about it immediately, and told me that it made her uncomfortable. Since then they have become close friends and over the past 6 months or so have been talking constantly outside of work, and go to lunch, and grab coffee together almost daily. She told me a couple months ago that he had made more comments about how her ass is the only reason he likes coming into the office, has told her how all Mexican men cheat in their wives (he’s Mexican), and has told her the only reason he’s still with his wife is because she takes complete care of him almost like mothering him. And I told her I didn’t like that and I was upset and she defended his actions and said that’s just how he is with every girl he is close with and his wife doesn’t care because she knows he won’t actually do anything. 

Now, I’ve been taking Wellbutrin for ADHD for a few months and it has caused massive anxiety, and this situation had me completely spiraling. We recently got Life360 (which is not super accurate on location) for our teenage kids but one day I got an alert that she left work, not unusual as it was around lunch time. I was busy working so I didn’t check it till about 20 minutes later and freaked out when it showed her at a hotel. My ex wife cheated on me so my reaction to this was not great, I went like straight into a panic and asked her where she was. She told me that her, her male coworker, and their boss were having lunch outside by the river, which was right next to the hotel. She goes to this general area almost daily because it’s full of restaurants and food vendors and sometimes they just sit at benches and people watch.

The next evening as we were packing to spend a long weekend alone together she could tell something was wrong and kept asking, so I sat her down and told her how I was uncomfortable with their relationship and gave her all the reasons why. She apologized profusely and said she had no idea I felt this way. Then she offered to distance herself from the situation and do whatever I needed to be comfortable. And said she wouldn’t talk to him outside of work anymore. She also talked to him and she told me that he felt terrible and liked me and never wanted to disrespect me. Then I screwed up Monday morning (or maybe not, I don’t know). When she was getting ready for work she put a thong on and I have never seen her wear one in my life, so I asked her about it and she said she’s been wearing them all the time lately because she has to work now that they returned to office and she has to walk a lot and it’s more comfortable when wearing pants. Later that day she started accusing me of scrutinizing everything she does and she’s feeling like she’s being controlled, and suggested I turn off my Life360 alerts so I don’t obsess over it all the time (which I wasn’t at the time but then felt like maybe I should be). This made me more anxious and made me feel like she was gaslighting me and trying to get me to be less aware of what she’s doing. 

I’ve started weaning off the Wellbutrin because I felt my reaction was extreme. I’ve never been an anxious person and I’ve never been the jealous type, even to the extent my wife has said that she wishes I was sometimes. I’m feeling more back to normal but I’m still not comfortable with their relationship or the things he’s said or her reaction to the things he’s said. She has never once told him it was inappropriate or asked him to stop. We are likely going to his party next weekend and I plan on confronting him and laying down some boundaries, and I kind of hope his wife overhears me layout the things he’s said and that I won’t allow that to happen again. Because I really don’t know if she is ok with that or if my wife was just saying that and she should know how he talks to other women. AIO with being upset about this?

The Fellow Opus feels a little plasticky. I know the gold standard has been the Ode 2 but I don't really like the fact that it can't handle espresso. Even though espresso is not currently on my radar, I don't like knowing that it's flat out not a possibility, which is what you get with the Ode 2.

Earlier today I was looking at grind settings for the C2 and discovered that Timemore had 2 new electric models, the E01 and the 01S. The E01 looks much nicer and the reviews I've seen seem convincing, however I can't find a lot of info online and am a bit torn. I also don't super like the fact that it doesn't have a cord and relies solely on battery. That said, it seems like it's quality built, is quite compact and sturdy and am really considering.

Any advice? Anyone has one and care to weigh in? Amy other electric grinders I might have overlooked?

**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the US (EST time zone, and with a rather sporadic schedule). My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, life is far more intricate than this. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are emphatically established and developed over time for a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**Also, no hesitations or doubts, please.** If you're at all interested then take the chance. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** My ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way. I seek people who generally know themselves and what they desire and offer. Being lost together is fun, but we each need a self to become lost. The type of connection I want also understands, accepts, and embraces the reality that there's more than deliberate engagement and a handful of interests that make someone up, from mundane chatter to intense distress. The type of connection I want strives to embrace these more grueling aspects of existence in a considerate way.
* **Being high in abstraction, sensation, and an ability to experience things beyond the blunt physical is pretty vital for me.** I want people with a vibrant imagination that are high in cognitive sensations in which such interaction, of various sorts, creates an elated state of splendor. I peak with ideation and abstraction, and seek out others who do as well.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics, which is one of the plaques I've placed above my abode in the Epistemic Wilderness. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and have actively sought out the most peculiar and obscure bits of knowledge possible since I was young. I seek peers in this and related endeavor.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, in which I primarily write about my observations and thoughts. I also adore writing conversationally, and am not uncommonly poetic and intense when doing so. Photography is also something I dabble in, although not as much as I'd like. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, and coffee.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with. A person who understands that no one will ever be your clone and dares to take exuberant advantage of that fact seems required for the deepest sorts of bonds.**  I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably detailed chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention; anything dazzling will also do. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",0,1746931749.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

I could really use some advice and insight on a situation that just happened.

I recently brought home a pair of young female rats, about 7–8 weeks old (I've had them for two days), and I also have a pair of older males, around 6–7 months. The boys and girls are housed on opposite sides of my room with no interaction, as I’m waiting to get the boys neutered before attempting any intros or bonding.

Last night while watching TV in the dark, I suddenly heard one of my males, Lou, squeaking and running around like crazy. I panicked, thinking he might be having a seizure or something. When I turned on the light, I was shocked to see not one, but two white bodies in his cage — Cream, one of the girls, had somehow chewed through the bars and made her way into Lou’s side.

Currently, Lou and his brother Marley are separated when I’m not around, as Lou has quite nasty hormonal aggression. He’s caused some bad injuries in the past — even to me — and I was terrified he might’ve hurt Cream. Luckily, after getting him out and checking her over, she had no visible injuries. Lou, however, seemed really shaken and kept seeking my attention.

I’ve now zip-tied plastic lids over the hole she chewed through, which is the best temporary fix I could come up with until I can afford a new cage (hopefully in about a month).

My questions are:

Why would such a young female try to get into the males' cage?
What's the most secure way to cover or repair the hole temporarily?
Any tips for managing young female behavior? This is my first time owning girls.
All four rats will eventually be bonded once the boys are neutered, but for now, I’m just trying to keep everyone safe. I never even saw her leave the girls’ cage — it happened so fast and quietly. Any help or experience would be hugely appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

(The two adorable monsters are in the first and second pics. 1 being cream and 2 being Lou, plus their cages mates Marley as 3 and coffee as 4)

The camera hovered above a dazzling metropolis, its silver towers slicing the morning mist like spears of ambition. Skies were alive with drones and autonomous craft flitting between designated paths, obeying a strict ballet of algorithmic control. Streets below bustled with people, many not walking but gliding on micro-platforms or exo-assisted frames. The camera tilted downward and began to zoom into a single vehicle—a sleek, dark blue cruiser with glowing trim, whispering silently down one of the mid-level flyways.

Inside the vehicle, Jack Rainer sipped recycled coffee from a biodegradable cup, eyes glazed as his mind reviewed the day's agenda. He wasn't driving—no one really did anymore. Personal control of vehicles had been outlawed a decade ago after the last manual crash sparked a city-wide transit audit. Now, every movement was curated by a central AI transit authority known simply as *Grid*. Jack liked the name. It made the world feel safe and predictable.

His morning routine was interrupted by a ping in his earpiece—three quick pulses. A call.

“Tom,” he muttered, accepting.

“Jack!” Tom’s voice exploded through the headset like a trumpet blast. “We got a game going on today at noon. Be there.”

Jack chuckled, adjusting the seat to lean slightly back. “Tom, you know I’m working today.”

“Jack, just listen.” Tom's voice dropped to a conspiratorial tone. “If we win today, you’ll get ten times your work credits.”

Jack blinked. “What? A whole kingdom?”

“Yep. If we take the core vault, it pays out in empire units. We split it based on buy-in. You’re sitting on twenty-five percent. If I get Rusty to join, it’ll drop a bit, though. Fair warning.”

Jack laughed. “And then I can finally pay you back for that patch of farmland you sold me last year.”

Tom didn’t miss a beat. “Hey, that farmland was legit.”

“That farmland was a dump, Tom. Literally a dump site. You sold me an old reclaim station buried in compost.”

“Urban farm potential!” Tom shot back. “OK, Jack. Good luck on the move-up.”

He hung up.

The vehicle hummed softly as it veered toward Sector 8’s SkyHub Tower, where Jack’s workplace—a data services firm called NovaFold—occupied the 97th to 101st floors. But Jack didn’t even glance up as they approached. His thoughts were already elsewhere.

*Ten times the credits.*  
In today’s economy, credits weren’t just currency—they were class. A person’s access to housing, healthcare, even network bandwidth depended on their earned or acquired credit stack. Owning a “kingdom,” as Tom put it, wasn’t just hyperbole—it meant you could buy naming rights for a block of the city, sponsor new urban development, or, if you were frugal, live for fifty years without ever working again.

Jack gave a quiet command: “Grid, redirect. Prep game loadout. Route to Zone Delta.”

“Confirmed,” came the polite AI reply. “Redirecting to *Gravemind Arena*. Estimated arrival: 11:47 a.m.”

Jack pulled up a translucent interface from his seat console, fingers dancing over the icons. The *game* was technically a simulation—fully legal, sanctioned by the Government of Collaborative Labor as an “aggressive creative outlet.” Thousands played daily, ranging from unemployed youth to corporate strategists. In the simulation, groups competed in high-stakes challenges that mimicked ancient feudal warfare, but with futuristic rules: digital battlegrounds, terrain morphing, zero-death scenarios. Lose, and your virtual assets were wiped. Win, and the system rewarded you with real-world credit multipliers.

He wasn’t just a low-level analyst anymore. Jack was a captain in one of the better-known guilds—The Copper Sons. And this raid? It wasn’t just any game.

It was a move-up.

Each month, top-tier guilds could compete in sanctioned ""ascension"" matches—multi-hour campaigns that pulled strategic and tactical data from all previous matches and evolved dynamically. Winning one didn’t just mean credit. It meant recognition. Sponsorship. A seat at the table.

The vehicle descended like a hawk gliding into position, softly touching down on a floating pad near Gravemind Arena, a black polygonal dome with streaming light panels pulsing across its skin. Jack stepped out, fully dressed in what appeared to be civilian clothes but were embedded with haptic threads and neural sync points. Inside, he’d become someone else.

The entry scan passed in seconds. Jack walked through the staging hall to the Copper Sons' chamber. Tom was already there, hunched over a display table, fingers sliding miniature representations of territory lines and control nodes.

“Rusty’s in,” Tom said. “That puts you at 19 percent.”

“Fine,” Jack replied, accepting a neural sync helmet from the gear wall. “But I want front line. No backdoor stuff. Let me earn the killpoints.”

Tom smirked. “Wouldn’t dream of it.”

The simulation initialized in a blink.

They were dropped into a desert biome, the sun overhead brutal and red. The enemy, *Guild Twelve*, controlled three fortress towers, each shielded by kinetic domes. The vault sat buried beneath a central pyramid—the kind used in old-world burial rites but now pulsing with nanofiber vines and turrets.

Jack’s squad hit fast. They sliced across the left flank with magnetized hover sleds, scattering drone swarms with EMP bursts. The battle was pure chaos: traps folding terrain, gravity reversals, momentum nullification. Through it all, Jack held the spear—literally a seven-foot energy spike—and drove it into the heart of the enemy's second-in-command during a narrow breach.

With each kill, credits tallied silently. With each capture, their ""empire value"" rose.

And then came the vault.

A final stand.

Turrets fell. Support lines collapsed. Jack found himself inside the vault's outer shell, oxygen down to 10% simulated, limbs dragging from neural lag. Rusty covered him, launching a viral worm into the last firewall node. And then—entry.

Jack dropped to one knee inside the throne chamber. A floating glyph asked him one question:

**""Who do you crown?""**

“Jack Rainer,” he said, voice barely audible.

**Crown confirmed. Empire Units issued: x10. Distribution by stake. Adjusted balance: 19%.**

The screen blinked. Game over.

When he awoke back in the real world, the arena's chamber felt impossibly still. He sat up, chest rising and falling in time with the flickering light from the dome’s center core. Tom was already checking his balance on the display wall.

“You’re a rich man, Jack,” Tom said.

“I don’t feel rich,” Jack replied, pulling off the sync helmet.

“Then you’re doing it wrong.”

They both laughed.

Outside, the sun had lowered. Jack returned to his vehicle, watching the sky begin its slow turn toward twilight. Grid had already plotted a route home, but Jack hesitated.

“Grid,” he said. “Pause route.”

“Command acknowledged.”

He looked out across the city. Somewhere out there, he now owned a piece of the future. Maybe even the resources to rebuild that old patch of land Tom had dumped on him. Maybe he’d turn it into a true farm this time—vertical fields, solar racks, a few chickens if licensing allowed.

The vehicle lifted into the air again.

The camera followed, pulling back now, up and out from the cabin, past the dome of the Gravemind Arena, past the hover routes and transit corridors, past the lights of the ever-moving city. As Jack’s cruiser moved off into the great electric dusk, the skyline burned gold.

The game was over.

The kingdom was his.

I write to you today not as a concerned citizen, but as a broken one—both spiritually and emotionally. I used to live in a modest home near Vinewood Hills, where the most excitement I expected was a distant police siren or a mild earthquake. But that was before GTA Online turned this city into a lawless sandbox from hell.

Let me walk you through a typical Tuesday:
	
•	6:45 AM: I wake up to the sound of explosions. Not fireworks. Not construction. But someone’s Oppressor Mk II “accidentally” nuking a Prius three blocks down. The driver then proceeds to spin donuts in midair and shoot a homing missile at my mailbox. It’s the third one this week.
	
•	7:00 AM: I attempt to make coffee. Just as the kettle whistles, a tank rolls through my backyard. A tank. Not military, mind you—just some guy named “xX_N0Sc0p3B0ss_Xx” livestreaming his chaos spree.
	
•	7:10 AM: I leave for work. I don’t make it far. I’m carjacked at a red light by a shirtless man in pink shorts and a monkey mask. He apologizes, then immediately blows himself and my sedan up with a sticky bomb. Insurance has stopped taking my calls.
	
•	7:15 AM: I respawn in an alley behind a taco shop and get sniped before I can say “Passive Mode.” My ghost now haunts Vespucci Beach.

Meanwhile, the police? They exist only to lightly jog after criminals or accidentally run over pedestrians while yelling, “Stop right there!” One officer used my garden gnome for target practice.

And don’t get me started on the noise. Every 30 seconds, a twin-turbo lowrider blasts past my window playing bass so loud it resets my Wi-Fi router.

Even my cat has given up. She lives under the fridge now and only emerges when the server crashes.

So I beg you: please shut down GTA Online. Or, at the very least, restrict the weaponized vehicles, airstrikes, and people dressed as aliens with miniguns. Or move the entire operation to Cayo Perico. Or North Yankton. Or a volcano.

Yours in eternal respawn limbo,

And all we do as Humans and plants and bacteria here is just slowing down the Entropy for some determined future of our reality: Heat Death. Slowing it down and riding the wave of entropy, borrowing some energy from the Sun to manipulate it a bit and turn into a cup of coffee or a girlfriend. To enjoy life a bit. So all we get literally comes from the Sun and we are all its creations. Creating dramaturgical potential, our personal one, for some of the general steps of reality. In a given location of space-time.

It's common knowledge that the sun showers Earth with an immense amount of energy, from the visible light we see to various forms of electromagnetic radiation. Our atmosphere and surface absorb a significant portion of this energy, driving processes like photosynthesis, weather patterns, and the overall vitality of our planet.

But here's where it gets interesting: Sun produces all energy and matter we are using and consist of. We are maximum united with it. In our modern world we created so many games we forgot about the main cause of all of them, the Sun. Sun has a story, and it transmits its story forward in time. Because of fundamental law of Entropy. And our life stories and all our problems and accomplishments are always only a substories of the main one: the Sun. It has all answers.

https://preview.redd.it/py8qj27ld20f1.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4d1009045e331b515e91d0d274cc3ead0e8096e

 Entropy, a concept deeply rooted in the second law of thermodynamics, suggests that systems tend to move towards in a state of disorder or randomness. In the case of Earth and the sun's energy, this law implies that the absorbed energy isn't indefinitely stored or utilized within our planet.

So, how does the Earth loose energy? One major mechanism is through the reradiation of energy back into space. The Earth, being warmer than the frigid vacuum of space, emits infrared radiation. This outbound radiation carries away a substantial portion of the absorbed solar energy, maintaining a balance. 

https://preview.redd.it/6oo60qrmd20f1.png?width=2036&format=png&auto=webp&s=dfc911730b5e9e80b48fdddc97fc19467794a084

Ultimately, a fraction of the sun's energy doesn't just bounce back into space directly from Earth's surface. Some of it is utilized in driving various Earthly processes, but a significant portion finds its way back into the cosmic void.

Plants are remarkable organisms practice a form of alchemy known as photosynthesis, where they harness the sun's energy, combining it with water and carbon dioxide to create a magical elixir – glucose. 

https://preview.redd.it/6sjkfqjod20f1.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=11ceafec17d2ecb01a66cc963420af4cd525cbd6

Contrary to popular belief, plants are selective about their recipe for glucose. While they do extract some minerals from the soil, the primary ingredients are **sunlight** and water. Through the miraculous process of photosynthesis, plants convert solar energy into chemical energy stored in glucose, essentially creating their own form of solar batteries.

  The structures of plants, from leaves to stems, act as reservoirs for this stored solar energy. Think of them as living batteries, charged by the sun. This energy-rich compound, glucose, becomes the currency that powers various cellular processes within the plant.

Here's where it gets fascinating. When we burn wood or other plant material, we're essentially releasing the stored solar energy in the form of heat and light.

This process, although ancient, is a tangible manifestation of the sun's energy returning to the environment. It's a beautiful reminder that the energy we use for warmth and light has ancient origins.

   Beyond direct combustion, the journey of solar energy extends to more complex forms. Plants, over millions of years, transform into fossil fuels like coal and oil. These fuels, when burned, release the stored sunlight in a manner that sustained Earth's ecosystems long before humans arrived on the scene.

So if we look at all of this through process philosophy, and especially computational dramaturgy, you can say “Sun plays stories of our lives”. Because it gives energy that is washed away in time, but we surf it on a surfboard of a free will. Creating an illusion of consciousness and a free choice. Remaining the part of a fully computational world.

   If you are a fed up with life clerk or a big Boss that punishes his enemies, remember, you still only have time and energy for that because you are literally fed and created by the sun. Visible light from the Sun shapes your desires and its energy made your hot bathtub hot.

  This kind world perception, when you are not a main character is very healthy and saves a lot of money used for drugs from anxiety. Relax, you are not important. Enjoy life.

1kjqgid,https://www.reddit.com/r/plural/comments/1kjqgid/how_a_lack_of_sleep_affects_us_as_a_system/,How a lack of sleep affects us as a system,"As most probably know, a lack of sleep significantly impacts your mental health, regardless if you are a system or not. It can increasing the risk of mood disorders, anxiety, and depression, and potentially exacerbating existing mental health conditions. Sleep deprivation can also impair cognitive functions like decision-making, judgment, and problem-solving, further affecting emotional regulation and well-being.

That being said, we simply wanted to talk how a lack of bodily sleep affects us as a system..

Knowing that a lack of sleep can worsen symptoms you may already have/experience, we noticed that for us, on the nights where we get little to no sleep, we experience a lot of things by tenfolds. We dissociate more, communication between headmates becomes harder to accomplish, we tend to have such a harder time telling if we're switching or not (hard to tell who we even are atm) and even leads to a lot of emotional regulation issues, causing a lot of our other mental health issues to also get worse. It makes our depression get worsen. Episodes of derealization or depersonalization become more frequent. We are constantly on the verge of an anxiety attack by the littlest thing, and in general just makes us constantly unstable emotionally.
Three hours ago we isolated ourselves and cried ourself to sleep for a nap, even though we rested for a bit, everything is still cranked up to an 8 emotionally/mentally.

As for a solution for this, we found that practicing proper sleep habits helps everyone within the system, and we recommend that even as a system, you practise healthy sleep habits.
(Do as we say not as we do)
Here's a few things we sometimes do that helps us get a goodnight's rest.

Set A Shared Sleep Routine.
Agree as a system (as much as possible) on consistent sleep/wake times. Even if headmates have different preferences, aim for a compromise that supports the body's needs.

Carefully Choose Sleep-Fronting Headmates.
Some systems designate specific headmates to front near bedtime—those who are calm, grounded, or good at helping the body rest. If you don't have a dedicated headmate, ask your fellow headmates who would be willing and comfortable with sharing the bed/body with you during bedtime that you know takes rest seriously. Rotate roles if needed, or assign ""rest guardians"" who make sure others aren't keeping the body awake. Don't be like me where I invited a headmate who lives off coffee to sleep in the body, because SHOCKINGLY sleeping does not get done. Pick your headmates wisely.

Practise Internal Quiet Time.
It's basically like meditation. Set a designated quiet or low-activity period before sleep (30–60 minutes) and use grounding techniques, light inner world visualization, or calming internal conversation to reduce system-wide activity. 
Encourage all fronting or nearby headmates to focus on body sensations: deep breaths, muscle relaxation, or heartbeat awareness.
Grounding helps anchor the system in the present and prepares the body for sleep.

Journaling Before Bed.
Write down thoughts, switches, emotions, or tasks from different headmates. This helps offload mental clutter and reduce anxiety-driven insomnia.

Make Agreements on Late-Night Switching.
If switching at night is common, agree on ""quiet hours"" or ""no-switch unless necessary"" rules, unless a headmate is taking over to help the body rest. This is something we are currently still working on as a system because MULTIPLE SOMEONES think it's okay to do whatever they want regardless of time..

External Aids.
We find that external aids are the most important for us, mainly because it signals to everyone that it's time for rest. Weighted blankets, calming music, white noise, or specific scents (lavender, for example) may help soothe multiple headmates at once. If there is a specific activity that you as a collective or the frequent fronter like to do to unwind, this would be the time to do it.
For us, we tend to do word searches before bed some nights, and have been considering doing it more often as of late as we notice it helps us relax a lot more than rewatching a youtube video.

We have no idea how to end this but I guess... What are some struggles do you deal with as a system when you lack sleep? What are some things you do to help with sleep as a system? We're curious in knowing how others tackle this problem too.
