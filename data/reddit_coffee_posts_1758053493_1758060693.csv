Toronto, January 2025. Snow fell gently, cloaking the city in a layer of pristine indifference. But Eugene didn’t have time to admire the winter wonderland—he was too busy gearing up for yet another round in his never-ending legal circus. Armed with a pen, a stack of documents, and enough caffeine to power a city block, Eugene was ready to take on the *esteemed* bureaucracy of legal chaos and its motley crew of robe-wearing dramatists.. ""I didn’t choose the legal life,"" Eugene muttered under their breath, ""the legal life chose me.""

Inside 130 Queen Street, the Divisional Court building hummed with the dull energy of people who’d long given up hope of finding justice, replaced by the thrill of completing forms in triplicate. “If Kafka and Orwell had a baby,” Eugene muttered, clutching a stack of documents that could double as body armor, “it’d grow up to design this system.”Eugene’s battle was no ordinary David-versus-Goliath story. His Goliath wasn’t a singular foe but a hydra with heads labeled College, Employers, Unions, Tribunals, and Courts. Every time he lopped off one head, two more sprouted, and each came with a filing fee.

“If irony were a sport,” Eugene quipped to the security guard who now greeted him by name, “I’d have a maple leaf tattooed on my podium. Gold medal, no question.” The guard gave a polite chuckle—the kind that said he’d heard the line one too many times.

The HRTO and WSIB had handed Eugene case number, but it might as well have been tattooed on his forehead. Between the rejected applications, delayed hearings, and dismissal letters, he had enough paper to start a bonfire—or at least keep warm through February. “At this point, I’m not even fighting for justice,” Eugene grumbled into his coffee. “I’m fighting just to see how ridiculous this can get. Spoiler alert: very.”He stepped outside for a breath of fresh air, where the snowflakes floated down like a gentle reminder that the world didn’t care. “I swear,” he muttered, watching his breath freeze midair, “if this were a movie, it’d be called *Fifty Shades of Litigation*. And I’m the unpaid extra who keeps getting dragged back into the plot.”But Eugene wasn’t about to give up. No, giving up was for people with lives, hobbies, or an actual shot at peace of mind. “Besides,” he thought to himself, “if I quit now, who’s going to keep these bureaucrats in shape? Lifting all this paperwork has to count as cardio.”

**The Background Circus**

Eugene’s workplace didn’t just disregard safety standards—they treated them like a mythical creature: nice to imagine but utterly nonexistent. Diagnosed with severe health conditions that left him in constant pain and teetering on the edge of collapse, Eugene’s requests for accommodations were met with the kind of enthusiasm reserved for tax audits.

The employer’s unofficial motto? “If it doesn’t kill you, it’s not our problem.”The Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) wasn’t much better. Designed to protect injured workers, it functioned more like a bureaucratic obstacle course. Endless forms, delayed responses, and denials disguised as ""assessments"" left Eugene wondering if the system’s real purpose was to wear people down until they gave up. “They call it WSIB,” Eugene quipped. “I call it *We’re Sorry It’s Bogus.*” Despite his Herculean efforts, it often felt like the system was designed to exhaust, not assist. WSIB sent him to a ""Hard Work Program"" that would make Navy SEALs cry, all while denying basic accommodations. “I signed up for compensation,” Eugene joked, “not boot camp.”

Then there was the union—a shining beacon of incompetence. Instead of fighting for him, they fought against him, mishandling his grievances and leaking his private medical information like gossip at a high school cafeteria. Promises of advocacy? Broken. Accurate information about benefits? Forget it. “The union said they were on my side,” Eugene later joked. “I just didn’t realize it was the side of my employer.”

When his workplace and union both failed him, Eugene turned to the HRTO. That’s where he learned that justice doesn’t just move slowly—it moves at a pace that makes glaciers look hyperactive. Case became his personal purgatory, drowning him in red tape, filing fees, and procedural delays.But Eugene’s troubles didn’t start with the Tribunal; they began with a job that treated workers like disposable parts in a machine. Chronic pain, debilitating injuries, and unsafe working conditions were ignored as if acknowledging them might disrupt the profit margins. Safety protocols? Optional. Accommodations? Only if you considered being overworked into a health crisis an ""accommodation.""“I wasn’t asking for the moon,” Eugene would later say. “Just to not be permanently broken by my job. Apparently, even that was too much for them.”The union’s so-called ""support"" only made things worse. Medical privacy was thrown out the window, grievances were dismissed faster than an unpaid parking ticket, and any promises they made dissolved like snowflakes on a Toronto sidewalk. “They said they’d represent me,” Eugene said bitterly. “Turns out they represented the concept of incompetence.” “They said they’d have my back,” Eugene laughed bitterly. “Turns out they meant with a knife.”By the time Eugene stood before the HRTO, he wasn’t just fighting for justice—he was fighting to survive a system designed to exhaust him. Case 403/24 became a never-ending battle against a machine that thrived on apathy and delay. But Eugene wasn’t about to quit. When the system turned its back on him, he decided to keep pushing forward—not for the win, but because he refused to let them bury him without a fight.

**One-Liners Galore to Keep You Sane (Think Prozac, Xanax, and Tequila—Spoiler: Stay Off the Floor)**·

“I filed at HRTO. They responded with a delay so long, I forgot what I was filing for.”·

“I asked for workplace safety, and they handed me a canary and said, ‘Good luck!’”·

“If justice is blind, then bureaucracy must be deaf and has no GPS and they forgot to mention it’s also hard of hearing and has a terrible sense of direction.""·

“Workplace safety? It’s like Russian roulette—except every chamber is loaded, and you’re the one holding the gun.”·

“I asked for workplace safety, and they handed me a canary with a knowing smile. Spoiler: it didn’t make it.”· “Filing a motion with the Divisional Court is like ordering fast food—if your burger took five years, cost $200, and came without fries.”·

“Filing a case with Courts feels like diving into quicksand, except the quicksand sends you invoices.”· “Divisional Court? More like the Bermuda Triangle of legal progress. Enter if you dare.”·

“Between WSIB, HRTO and Courts, my new hobbies are crying into forms and drinking coffee strong enough to dissolve my filing fees.”·

“The Attorney General must be ghosting me. Either that or their office is stuck in a bureaucratic black hole.”· “Every organization told me, ‘We can’t help.’ I didn’t know ‘passing the buck’ came with an Olympic training program.”

**The Paper Trail from Hell: A Dark Comedy of Canadian Injustice**

Eugene’s submissions to the courts and human rights bodies weren’t just legal documents—they were architectural wonders, sturdy enough to double as a coffee table or a booster seat for a short judge. His accusations spanned the entire spectrum of bureaucratic dysfunction: employer negligence, union betrayal, tribunal incompetence, and even judicial bias.

""If paperwork were a weapon,"" Eugene mused, ""I’d be leading an army.""The process seemed less about justice and more about grinding him down. The Subjects responded to his claims with a deluge of documents so voluminous it made *War and Peace* look like light reading. As Eugene sifted through the mountain of exhibits, he couldn’t help but chuckle, ""Exhibit D has more plot twists than a Netflix thriller.""

Eugene had planned every detail of the case meticulously. ""If this were a heist movie,"" they thought, ""I’d be George Clooney... except with fewer Oscars and more Post-it notes.""Eugene’s new reality revolved around filing motions, rebutting objections, and injecting just enough sarcasm to keep his sanity. ""Humor is key,"" he said. ""Otherwise, this would just be an overpriced masterclass in existential despair.""Accommodations? Denied. Constitutional questions? Ignored. Deadlines? A joke. Correspondence either got lost en route or arrived fashionably late, like a bad date. ""At least they’re consistent,"" Eugene sighed, ""consistently dreadful.""The physical toll of his legal battles was almost as severe as the psychological one. ""Who needs a gym membership when lifting this case file gives you the same gains as CrossFit?"" he quipped, as he wrestled yet another binder into submission.

Eugene’s filings were encyclopedic—an anthology of failure across multiple institutions. They captured everything: fabricated claims by WSIB, HRTO’s disregard for evidence, and systemic barriers so robust they deserved an award. His work was a tragic symphony of bureaucratic incompetence played in a minor key.""If there’s one thing Canada does well,"" Eugene reflected, ""it’s turning injustice into performance art. And here I am, stuck in the middle of a Kafkaesque exhibit.""

**A Black Hole of Accountability**

The HRTO wasn’t the only institution turning a blind eye. Complaints to the Attorney General’s office went unanswered, like shouting into the void. Workplace safety boards, ombudsman offices, human rights commissions, and legal support centers all joined the chorus of “Not our problem.”Even WSIB (Workers’ Safety and Insurance Board) decided to pile on. They fabricated claims, misrepresented medical evidence, and shoved them into a “rehabilitation program” better suited for Navy SEAL training. “My doctor said rest,” they deadpanned, “but WSIB thought CrossFit was the cure. Spoiler: it wasn’t.”

**Battling the Courts and Tribunal Hydra**

Eugene’s odyssey through the labyrinth of tribunals and courts was a masterclass in frustration. Over the years, he endured more delays, dismissals, and baffling procedural hurdles than he could count. The Tribunals relentless denial of accommodations and its uncanny ability to ignore critical evidence might have been impressive—if it weren’t so maddening. “They should rename this place the *Tribulation Office*,” Eugene quipped. “At least then, it’d be truth in advertising.”

When the Courts entered the fray, things didn’t get better. Decisions arrived devoid of reasoning, constitutional questions were dismissed with a casual wave, and Eugene’s voice seemed lost in the judicial void. “They say the wheels of justice turn slowly,” Eugene sighed, “but these wheels aren’t just slow—they’re square.”Years ticked by. Complaints stacked higher than his patience, delays stretched endlessly, and decisions reeked of indifferent efficiency.

The Tribunals and Courts knack for denying accommodations, ignoring evidence, and dismissing cases bordered on performance art. “I’ll give them credit for one thing,” Eugene remarked dryly. “They’re consistent—consistently useless.”Even when the Higher Courts stepped in, it felt more like stepping backward. Constitutional questions were brushed aside, rulings were vague at best, and every request seemed to meet a collective shrug. “At this point,” Eugene muttered, “the wheels of justice aren’t turning—they’re rusting.”

Desperate for a glimmer of fairness, Eugene turned to the Courts, only to find a bureaucratic machine grinding at its own glacial pace. Cases dragged on for years, evidence went unnoticed, and rulings felt more like cryptic riddles than resolutions. “The Tribunals and Courts operates on a timeline all its own,” Eugene said with a weary smile. “It’s like dog years—but slower. By the time they resolve one case, I’ll be eligible for a senior’s discount.”

**In Court: The Comedy of Errors**

Eugene entered the courtroom armed with determination and a well-honed sense of sarcasm. “Your Honor,” he began, “I’d like to address tribunal delays, systemic discrimination, and the fact that I’ve aged a decade waiting for this moment.”The court, however, was unshaken. Delayed decisions, denied accommodations, and a pervasive sense of indifference became the norm. The only thing moving faster than the proceedings was Eugene’s patience—right out the door.Judges swatted away constitutional questions like pesky flies, tribunals ignored established precedents, and requests for accommodations were treated as luxuries, not rights.

When Eugene asked for an interpreter due to psychological distress, the response was a vague, “We’ll get back to you... eventually.”Inside the courtroom, the absurdities continued to pile up. Evidence was dismissed with a wave, rulings were cryptic at best, and the process felt like an elaborate game where the rules were rewritten daily. Eugene couldn’t resist quipping, “Your Honor, I’d love to present my case, but I think my rights got lost somewhere in the filing cabinet.”

Finally, the day of the hearing arrived. Eugene stood before the court, heart pounding like a drum solo, while the opposing side delivered their arguments with the enthusiasm of someone reading warranty terms.When it was Eugene’s turn, he leaned into the microphone and deadpanned, “I’ll keep this brief—mostly because I skipped breakfast.” The room chuckled, but beneath the humor, Eugene’s frustration simmered. As the case dragged on, Eugene faced each absurdity with his dark wit intact. “At this rate, Your Honor,” he said, “my grandchildren will be arguing this case for me. Let’s hope they’re better at it than I am.”

Victory was far from assured, but Eugene walked away with two things: the moral high ground—and a pretty decent punchline.

**A System Rigged for Failure**

By now, Eugene had cracked the code: this wasn’t one man’s struggle—it was a masterclass in systemic failure. The institutions supposedly built to protect workers and uphold rights were about as useful as a screen door on a submarine.Requests for help were met with a symphony of silence, a chorus of excuses, or the occasional crescendo of outright hostility. “Oh, the system isn’t broken,” Eugene mused, his exhaustion tempered by sharp sarcasm. “It’s a well-oiled machine, meticulously designed to grind people like me into a fine powder.”

The so-called safeguards seemed to have a single function: making sure that justice remained a rumor. Complaints disappeared faster than donuts in a break room, accommodations were treated like lottery prizes, and decisions seemed to be made with a Magic 8-Ball.Each step forward felt like being on a treadmill set to ""futile."" The harder he pushed, the faster the system found new ways to push back. “At this point,” Eugene joked darkly, “I should be charging them for the cardio workout.”The message was clear: the system wasn’t just rigged—it was weaponized. And Eugene, like countless others, was left wondering if the game was even worth playing. “They don’t want you to win,” he muttered with a grim chuckle. “They want you to give up—and I’d almost applaud the efficiency of their cruelty if I wasn’t the one paying for it.”

**Epilogue: A Snowy Fight**

Despite everything, Eugene stood defiant. His submission to the UN OHCHR wasn’t just a desperate move—it was a battle cry for every injured worker, every person with disabilities, and every marginalized soul ground down by the system. “The pen is mightier than the sword,” Eugene quipped, hoisting his stack of evidence. “Though honestly, this stack could do more damage than a sword if I dropped it on someone.”

Stepping into the snow outside the courthouse, Eugene tilted his head skyward, letting the flakes settle on his coat. “They say justice is blind,” he muttered. “In Canada, it’s also lost, confused, and apparently still using dial-up.”The bitter cold matched the frozen gears of the system he was up against, but Eugene pressed on. His fight wasn’t just personal; it was for every voice silenced by bureaucracy, every life upended by indifference. “They say you can’t fight city hall,” he grinned, “but nobody said I couldn’t file an international complaint. Let’s see them shuffle *this* under the rug.”

As the snow thickened, Eugene glanced at the courthouse one last time. “Justice may be blind,” he said with a grim smile, “but here, it’s also severely delayed, wearing earplugs, and probably stuck in a snowdrift.”But Eugene wasn’t about to give up—giving up was for people with better things to do, like having hobbies, peace of mind, or a functioning will to live.. “I’ll beat this system,” he said to himself, trudging back inside. “Or at least outlast it. Assuming it doesn’t kill me first. Honestly, place your bets.”With a stack of papers heavier than his resolve and a sense of humor darker than a Canadian winter, Eugene braced himself for the next chapter. “If I’ve learned one thing,” he chuckled, “it’s that laughter doesn’t fix anything—but it’s a hell of a lot cheaper than therapy.”",1,1758060212.0,humanrights,0,1.0,False

1niv95c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1niv95c/i_tried_atomic_habits_for_3_months_heres_what/,"I tried ""Atomic Habits"" for 3 months - here's what worked and what didn't","Three months ago, I decided to properly implement the Atomic Habits system instead of just reading about it. Instead of just reading it and moving on, I decided to actually test his methods for a full 3 months

Here's my honest breakdown of what actually moved the needle vs. what was overhyped.

What WORKED incredibly well:

**1. Habit stacking was a game changer**

The concept was to attach new habits to existing ones using ""After I \[current habit\], I will \[new habit\].""

So to implement this principle ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will read for 10 minutes."" It worked for me because I was already making coffee every day, so I didn't need to remember a new trigger. The habit piggybacked on something automatic.

**2. The 2-minute rule eliminated my excuses**

The idea with this was tart with a version that takes less than 2 minutes.

What I did:

* ""Exercise for 30 minutes"" became ""Put on workout clothes""
* ""Read a book"" became ""Read one page""
* ""Meditate for 20 minutes"" became ""Sit on my meditation cushion""

I couldn't procrastinate on something that took literally 2 minutes. Once I started, I usually kept going. For some people they struggle with this I think you just have to turn off your brain when it starts to whine. Because that's what I did that made it work.

**3. Environment design was ridiculously effective**

The concept was to Make good habits obvious and bad habits invisible.

So what I did was:

* Put a book on my pillow (so I'd see it before bed)
* Kept workout clothes next to my bed
* Moved my phone charger to the kitchen (so I wouldn't scroll in bed)

The result I found was I stopped relying on willpower and let my environment do the work. Which honestly helps me because I'm a chronic procrastinator.

**4. Identity-based habits stuck better**

I tried it and implemented this mindset: Instead of ""I want to read 12 books this year"" I said: ""I'm someone who reads daily"". Every time I read, even for 5 minutes, I was proving to myself that I was ""a reader."" It became part of who I am.

What DIDN'T work (or was harder than expected):

1. Tracking everything became overwhelming.

James Clear suggests tracking habits, so I tracked 5 different habits daily. This went wrong because the tracking became a chore. I'd forget to mark things down, then feel guilty, then abandon the whole system.

What I learned was to track 1-2 habits max instead. More than that becomes administrative work.

2. The habit scorecard felt judgmental

The ideas was to List all your current habits and rate them as positive, negative, or neutral.

It made me hyper-aware of every ""bad"" habit and created unnecessary guilt. I'd rate ""checking social media"" as negative, then feel bad every time I did it. I realized focusing on adding good habits instead of cataloging all my flaws was a better option.

3. Implementation intentions were hit or miss

This didn't work though the ideas was simple: Plan exactly when and where you'll do your habit: ""I will \[behavior\] at \[time\] in \[location\].""

What happened instead was life doesn't always cooperate with rigid schedules. When my planned time didn't work out, I'd skip the habit entirely instead of adapting. Instead I did flexible habit stacking that could move around my day. Which helped me more.

4. The plateau of latent potential was real

Results often lag behind effort you might not see progress for weeks, then suddenly breakthrough. Even knowing this intellectually, I still got discouraged during the ""valley of disappointment"" phase. Some habits took 6+ weeks before I saw real benefits.

My biggest discoveries:

* Starting stupid small beats starting ambitious. Reading 1 page daily led to reading 20+ books. Putting on workout clothes led to working out 4x/week. The 2-minute rule isn't a trick a it's psychology that works.
* Environment beats motivation. every time I wasted years trying to build willpower. Changing my environment did more in 3 months than years of ""trying harder."" I was surprised by this.
* Identity change is the real goal. The habits that stuck were the ones that made me feel like I was becoming someone new, not just doing different things.

3 months later:

I'm reading 30 minutes daily, working out 4x/week, and meditating most days. More importantly, these feel automatic now instead of forced.

The book's core insight is true about how small changes compound into remarkable results. But you have to actually apply the methods, not just read about them.

Good luck!

1niv82c,https://i.redd.it/h5vefwvxflpf1.png,3V 10A motor PWM/sync buck converter design,"Hello everyone

I have an old electric screwdriver with dead batteries that I want to turn into a coffee grinder motor. If I were to start from scratch I would probably go another route or just buy an electric coffee grinder, but I already have the motor with it's gearbox, mosfets, assorted electronic components, power supplies and a 3D printer for the enclosure.

I know for a fact that this thing can grind coffee with the batteries (tho they die after one grind), and I also know that for that purpose I need more than 6A at \~3-4v, as that's my bench power supply max current and it's not enough. Stall current should be around 12A with DC resistance around 300mOhm. (Side note: I'm actually surprised that 3xAA NiMHs can deliver this much current and survive for a few years). A PWM driven motor is basically a buck converter, right? So with this much current and low voltages a freewheel diode would eat up to 10W and my only option is to go synchronous with N and P mosfets with heatsinks

My quiestions are:

1. Does this thing make sense overall?
2. I don't have the equipment to test the motor inductance, so does 1mH sound reasonable? The motor is around 35mm long and 35mm in diameter if it's worth something. If so, it means that the LR time constant should be around 300hz. I guess then than anything over 1khz should be enough, this application is not really ripple sensitive anyways. But 1khz is an annoying frequency, so 10khz should be less audible (my dog may think otherwise)
3. Im planning to use a 555 timer in astable mode with around 10khz and \~25% duty cycle to get around 3-4 volts. Is the 200mA output of the 555 enough to drive the mosfets hard enough at 10khz? I hope so because the one thing that I dont have are dedicated mosfet drivers. About gate voltages, with 12V input even at 2V low and 10V high it should be safe I suppose
4. A 12V 3A power supply will probably not be enough for the current surges, I assume, so the circuit should use some beefy decoupling capacitors. Would an inductor choke be necessary as well? Or is the motor's inductance enough?

If I'm missing something else just let me know

I had a wonderful night of Fellowship last night, and feel like I'm on cloud 9. As I hit a milestone in my sobriety, I am getting reflective, so here's my story so far:

I, like many others, first walked into the rooms pretty certain I was hopeless. I walked in full of fear in February 2025. It wasn't my first meeting, but it was my first time attending a meeting with the **real** intention of getting sober, at least for a little while. I was sick and tired of not being able to stay stopped. Yet, I had things in mind: I was going to prove to those in my life that I *wasn't* lazy. I was going to get into trade school, get a better job, graduate high school finally (years later), and lose the alcohol weight. I was gonna learn how to stop waking up cringing at the terrible things I'd done, and how to feel like my body wasn't breaking down on me constantly. Then, naturally, once I'd proved myself to my peers, I'd pick up a drink again. 

My entire life I've struggled with ""depression"". Since the age of 12, I've had months-long bouts of time where I was unable to shower, get out of bed. I lacked purpose. I found alcohol and drugs to be a perfect escape from the realities I didn't want. My early drinking days were textbook. By 14, I was a blackout drinker. I distinctly remember being carried out of parties, falling asleep in bushes alone, and fighting with friends who just weren't drinking like I was. I loved that I could escape. I loved that I felt confident, that my fears and anxieties would disappear. 

Because alcohol was tougher to obtain - it required me flirting with older men outside of liquor stores or bribing the seniors at my high school to buy me liquor, I turned to weed as my daily fix. This was fine, of course, because it was a ""plant"" and not a drug. Didn't matter that I couldn't do anything without a toke, I didn't have a problem, because people can't have problems with weed! I would black out drinking on the weekends. It wasn't until I turned 17 and was living on my own that drinking became a daily occurence. 

At 21, after 4 brutal years of drinking and using other drugs daily. Pregnancies, putting myself in horribly dangerous situations, obliterating my savings, dropping out of high school, working a dead-end job, entering a co-dependant terribly toxic relationship, I knew I had a problem. Yet it wasn't until I walked into that first AA meeting in February that I was forced to say *""I'm an alcoholic"".* 

For a few weeks, I'd show up late to meetings and leave early. Never going to the same ones, never introducing myself as a newcomer. I heard people talk about God and I shuddered. This is a cult! I thought. I'll never work the steps, I'll never find a Higher Power. This is insanity worse than my addiction was. Plus, I thought, I'm too different. My childhood trauma is the reason for all of this. None of these people could ever understand. 

My worldview at this time looked like this: I am fundamentally incapable of living without substances. I will die before the age of 25. I will never be able to hold a proper job. I'll never have meaningful friendships. I am doomed to a life of living on the outskirts of society. I am too different from everyone I've ever met. There is no hope for me. A long list of things I can't do. My anger led me, my resentments controlled my life. Every thought, feeling and emotion was a reason to drink, and that would never ever change. 

Then something happened. A woman introduced herself to me at a meeting I'd been to a few times. I liked that it was small and that these people talked exactly the way I felt. I liked that it was a cozy room, and that they seemed to have hope. Against my better judgement, I asked her to sponsor me. Right away, she had me writing gratitude lists in the mornings. I had nothing to be grateful for! My life was a pile of shit! Yet, I tried.

I began to become familiar with the feeling of discomfort. Discomfort with talking about ""God"", with doing things I thought I could never do, like sharing in meetings. I started reading the Big Book with my wonderful sponsor. 

I began to feel good. Yet I was deeply uncomfortable. I didn't know what to do with hope. I didn't know what to do with feeling okay in my skin. I was terrified, and I didn't want to do the more difficult steps. At 110 days sober, I picked up a drink, and a bag, and I sat alone in my apartment and drank for 2 days straight. 

I didn't feel like that was me anymore. I enjoyed the feeling of oblivion but loathed giving up what I'd started building, My sponsor said something to me. She said ""no matter what, we will always be here for you."" She took me to coffee and a meeting the next day. I worked steps 3-7 over the next 4 months. My fifth step took 3 hours to complete and she listened intently to it all. I began to see my ""depression"" as something intrinsically linked with my addiction and alcoholic mind. That running towards discomfort is the single most important thing for my sanity. I, a woman who wanted to find ""chapters"" of AA that didn't mention God, now pray every morning and every night. The voice in my head that says prayer is a ridiculous waste of time dwindles with every day. 

I am beginning to feel the promises manifesting in my life, slowly but surely. I am 6 months into a one year trades program. I have sober friends. I no longer lead with fear or anger, and I am beginning to recognize my character defects and alcoholic behaviours in real time. The single most important word in my life now is consistency. I consistently show up to meetings even when I don't want to. I consistently pray. I consistently reach out to other people. I have a service position, I have a home group. 

Last night I went to a club with a friend, and we danced for hours, 100% sober. I woke up feeling confident in my skin and believing I have a place in this world. I feel supported by God, and I am able to consider others in all of my actions. I reach out to the newcomer. 

For a long time, I thought I was too young to be an alcoholic. Too young to belong to AA. That because I hadn't lost a wife, a home, or a well-paying job due to my addiction, I wasn't valid in needing a spiritual solution. The thing is, I am unbelievably grateful I found AA when I did. My life started this February. I never would've even come close to finding the marriage, the house or the job. Not if I continued living the way I was living. And, hell, I probably would've been dead before the age of 25! 

The world doesn't feel so dark and twisty anymore. I feel hope. I am learning to be vulnerable. Learning to love, to be tolerant. To be a friend and accept friendship in return. I am learning to work hard, and not just move quickly. I am learning to pity myself less, to be less angry. To let go of self will and stop isolating myself. My life is beginning because I heard others stories, because I know now that I am not alone. Because I am putting in the work. 

I can't believe I ever thought I couldn't live without a drink. The truth is, I couldn't live *with* one. I know now that I have a place in this world. That I am not doomed, and that others shouldn't suffer just because I don't always feel comfortable. I love waking up hangover-free and full of light. I love real friendships. I fucking love AA. 

Whatever I accomplish, whatever is given to me from this day forward, I will owe to this program.  It's such a privilege to be a part of this community. If you're new or struggling, hold on. Stick around for as long as it takes. It gets better with every day you try. and if you're young, don't let it deter you! You're never too young to be an alcoholic, and your bottom is whenever you decide you're done. As time goes on, clarity will show you how deep the allergy went. 

Thanks for my sobriety, and for my life.

I have mild IBS sympthoms when I eat certain foods and others give me more strong reactions so I 100% try to avoid them as much as I can. However when I see content about chinese food I see a lot of things that I can't eat, so I'm worried and thinking if anyone lives there with similar intolerances to mine, if they can tell me what foods can they eat that are easy to find.

**Things I can't eat:**

\- Garlic  
\- Lactose (Cheese, Milk, etc)  
\- Soy (only in very small quantities)   
\- Spicy Foods (most likely a problem lol never tried it)

**Things I try to avoid because it also upset my stomach but not as much:**

\- Broccoli  
\- Too much onions (few are not a problem)  
\- Chickpeas  
\- Coconut oil  
\- High FODMAP foods mostly

**Things I eat regularly and does very well on my stomach:**

\- Chicken  
\- Green / Dark Tea, Coffee, Lattes with no lactose, etc  
\- Potatoes  
\- Rice  
\- Almond Milk / Non lactose milk  
\- Mayonaisse  
\- Bread  
\- Carrots  
\- All types of meat  
\- Pasta

I would love to travel to China and try any food like any tourist, but sadly that's not my case, I don't want to end up wasting 2 days inside of the hotel shitting my pants or not being able to travel and stuff like that, so if I have to eat rice everyday and only drink water I will do, I'm just wondering if there are simple foods that I can eat there that I haven't seen in videos or reviews.

TLDR: The biggest problem for me are Garlic, Lactose, Soy and Spicy Foods.

Before going to bed, urinate (zero times). Go to sleep, and then all of a sudden, you have a bathroom trip at two in the morning. It occurs again a couple of hours later (two). I feel like I didn't get much sleep by morning.  
  
I once measured it out of desperation: about 600 milliliters per night. I can understand why my bladder wakes me up. I've already stopped drinking water in the evenings, stopped drinking coffee late, and even stopped eating snacks. My body still manages to find a way.

In fact, something I didn't anticipate—logging my evenings—helped. I kept a journal of my food, beverages, screen time, and stress levels. After a week, the patterns became apparent: salty meals combined with a phone before bed = surefire wake-ups.  
  
I was able to sleep for longer periods of time by putting my phone away earlier and switching from heavy meals to lighter ones. Better than before, but not perfect.  
  
I even made a one-page tracker and brief guide out of my notes; in case anyone is interested, you can find it in my profile bio.

My 20month old daughter is wildly independent and fearless. And she has an almost 4 year old sibling so she sees everything they can do and tries to copy. But she has been to the emergency department three times in the last year since she started walking. 

She’s had a giant goose egg on her forehead from a fall off the couch. A nearly broken nose from the same. A cut to her eyebrow, that’s now a faint scar, from falling off our coffee table face first onto a toy. She’s skinned her nose on concrete by tripping outside. She skinned her chin today doing the same. And she’s had a chemical burn on her arm that occurred at a family members home, that is now a long fresh scar down the length of her forearm. 
For not yet two years old she has incredible language skills and is so smart and expressive. She is so funny and full of personality. Her favorite words are “no, Me do!!” Like I said, she is SO independent and strong-willed. 

It kills me when these things happen and her beautiful face or skin is damaged. I’m really struggling to cope with the guilt and shame. But there is just no stopping her! She loves to be outside, and to climb, jump, and spin. I feel like an awful mother but I am with her all the time. Our house is baby proofed. We have strict rules about the couches and tables that we do NOT climb on them. But every time time she has an accident I was right there in the room but just took eyes off her for a couple minutes trying to do something like load the dishwasher or cook dinner.

1niv19h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1niv19h/our_valhalla_part_7/,Our Valhalla part 7,"It took long, slow, dominating strides, it knew I had nowhere to go. I tripped on the broken glass and shards decorated my arms and hands but I didn’t even feel them. It was so close to being entirely over me. I scampered forward on my hands and knees like a crazed animal, making large cuts with the glass. I wasn’t really thinking that much and somehow found myself in the vent. I rounded a corner and as I did its hand shot into the wall of the vent tunnel with aggressive force, entirely opposite to its contrived slow movements earlier. The wall dented and the echoing boom made me flinch. Its arm reached around the corner at me and I backpedaled hastily, leaving a trail of blood on the metal sheets. Its arm fell limp on the metal after it failed to grab onto me. I thought I might’ve been safe for the moment and tried to resume my breathing when a gory, wet, popping sound invaded my head and bounced down the vent. The hand, which was a few feet away from me now, started to slowly enter deeper into the system. It moved in short bursts, the attached arm becoming longer and longer. New elbows and shoulders were sent in after me creating a long segmented arm, it could hardly even be called an arm anymore. It took me a second to react and my response was flight, I scuttled backwards as fast as I could, the bandage on my hand had come off at some point and each thrust back left a gnarly handprint. The hand was crawling after me like a disabled spider, using my wet blood to keep track of me. I was approaching an intersection at the end of a long corridor. Its arm retracted a bit, curling up into a spring of bent joints, and shot out with much force, gnashing at me with its yellow uncut fingernails just millimeters from my feet. I backed into the crossroads just before it could touch me and I fell down. I tried to use my hands and feet to slow my descent but a piece of glass in my palm sliced free from the friction and I plummeted to the bottom, landing on top of a fan. Luckily the system was offline so I wasn’t shredded to bits. I tried to take the flashlight out of my pocket but my hands were too shaky and too slippery. 

I felt the walls and found a way forward, sounds of a limp, slithering hostility were making their way down towards me. I army-crawled forward and after a minute or so I was rewarded with light. I had managed to work my way down to level thirty-nine. I don’t know why, but all of the vent covers had been removed, so I had no problem getting out. I said my silent thanks to the AC demon and tried to stand up but my legs were too shaky. It looked like I was in a classroom. There was a chalkboard, a couple of lockers in a corner and a few lab desks around. I crawled under them towards the door, bumping into stools as I went. Until I heard a fleshy flopping sound behind me, the arm was hot on my trail. Imagining being dragged back up the ventilation system to a horrific demise made my movements accelerate. I kept pushing forward sloppily until I made it to the door, using the frame to stand up and struggling to reach out for the handle before shutting it just in time. It was a thick wooden door with a larger than usual window at the top, I could see into the room and the limb continued to pour in. The green sleeved amalgamation shakily rose to form a giant serpentine shape and struck the window hard, knocking me to the ground. The glass held and it continued to hold after the next few attempts. I just laid on my back watching it slam into the door, expecting it to reach in and grab me any moment. But it gave up. I managed to get to my feet on my own and peered into the classroom again, the arm was gone. And the timer was set. The marionette would be taking the elevator and would be down here any second. There was no way I’d be able to double back on it through the vent so I’d have to hide. 

The hallway didn’t have any lockers in it so I limped to the different classrooms as fast as I could to search for a spot. It was at this moment that I realized I was leaving a speckled red trail and hiding wouldn’t matter. I kept going anyways. There was a bathroom at the end of the hallway, I thought of what the kid in “The Shining” did and had an idea. I had no clue if I would have enough time to set it up but surely it must’ve been laborious to have to retract your hundred jointed arm up a ventilation shaft. I limped to the restroom and was relieved to see that it was the same kind as the one on the dorm floor. I struggled to stand on top of a toilet in a stall, the ceiling was one of those segmented ones so I punched one square in and slid it over the rest of the ceiling while making sure I didn’t fall off the porcelain chair. I made sure to leave handprints and footprints and such all over the place to make it look like I crawled up there. I then backtracked the way I came, all the way back to the classroom, awkwardly opening the door with my back to it. I made my way to a locker in the room while keeping an ear peeled for anything making its way through the vent. I opened the metal door with a shaky hand and slid inside, shutting it closed behind me just as the elevator dinged. 

I didn’t hear it coming, just as I had prophesized, but I could feel where it was. The closer it got to me the faster my heart would beat and that flavor of fear from my first meeting would surge through me. I could tell that after entering the floor, it immediately walked into my room and stood a few steps away from the locker I was in. I forced myself not to breathe. The only light I had was coming from the slits at the top of the locker, it could just take a few steps forward and look right down at me. I don’t know how long it stood there but it had to have been for at least five minutes, it was like it was waiting for me to forfeit. Delusions of surrendering and begging for mercy entered my mind and I had to shut them down. My hands and arms were bleeding badly so I pushed them into my pants to soak up what I could, the warm red flowed down my legs like piss. 

I was about to step out of the locker to surrender when the predatory feeling abated, it felt like it was walking away. Then came the next problem: should I wait or bolt for the elevator? If it was confident I was on this floor it might just wait inside the elevator for me and starve me out. If I bolted for the elevator though, it might be waiting around the corner to ambush me. I couldn’t just go back up the vent now either, it would hear me and stop me before I reach thirty-eight, I doubt I’d be able to climb up anyways. I grabbed onto the metal part of the inside of the door handle and slowly lifted it up without making a sound. I peeked through and the marionette had in fact left. I snuck out but the blood had trickled down my legs to my shoes and I slipped on myself. My hand, still holding on to the metal handle, pulled down hard to catch myself and it made a sound like a gunshot. I decided that the elevator was my only option now and forced my legs to cease their quaking so that they could run. I flew out into the hallway and was not met with ambush, instead it was standing at the end of the hallway, its hands held behind its back. It didn’t even bother checking my red herring in the bathroom, it was just waiting for me to come out so that it could play with me. It even left me the hope of making it to the elevator, but fear took hold and anchored me to the spot. 

It was just staring at me with its sick smile. The hands slowly, patiently rose from behind its back, like a musical conductor of a silent orchestra. They took their time to reach their apex, which was just below its shoulders height, then the legs moved. It was like they were in slow motion, a pendulum with a long string in low gravity. I tried to scream but all that came out was an incoherent babble. My foot shuffled a bit and my head twitched so that my eyes broke contact with it, looking down like a submissive dog outbarked. I tried to turn around but it felt like a sin, “He wouldn’t like that” was all I could think. The pain from my hands brought me back, I had been clenching my fingers right into the cuts causing them to pulse out red. It was still ten yards away or so, I could still make it if I went right now. I turned my back to it and started to walk to the doors, I couldn’t run yet. I felt anxious, like when you are the only person coughing during a quiet test in school. My shoes squeaked against the tile and my blood tapped the ground. I could feel it getting closer to me. I tried to run but I couldn’t remember how. The elevator was near and its doors hadn’t shut for some reason, I didn’t question it and stepped inside. I had turned around at some point to look back at it. It was so close now, twenty more seconds and its haunting chase would be complete; its hands were lower now, like they were expecting me. I wanted to see what would happen, what it would do to me, how it would do it. When I recall these memories everything loses its chronology. I start to remember confusions I had while I stood in that cabin. I thought of questions that I knew the answers to like “Why had my hand been cut in the first place?” and “Where am I?” Like the story could’ve started from here. I don’t remember what caused me to, but something let me push the surface button and the doors shut before its fingernails passed the door.

It smashed the door hard, over and over with the power of a bull. The sounds echoed up the shaft after me as I made my escape. Its weird hunting ritual had failed, twice, and I had evaded its brutal tantrum both times. The lights in the elevator were still off. I stared at the door silently during my ride, my mind broken from fear. The lights were off on the first floor again and it took me a moment to break free of my trance and realize that I had arrived. I could hear the elevator descend after I eventually exited. My footsteps were slow and uneven. I was on autopilot and my body and mind were separate. I stumbled into the entrance and climbed my way out, ignoring the pain the rope had on my palms. 

Manny was gone and there weren’t any parents either, Manny had probably just gone home. I deserved that after how mean I was to him. The moon was still high in the sky.

I had survived the bunker but I felt no satisfaction, I didn’t know what I felt. I just wanted to go home now. I don’t remember walking home, but I remember seeing the lights from the houses as I approached the neighborhood. It looked like everyone was awake, maybe Manny did tell Mom.

I prepared for the worst scolding of my life and went through the back door into the house but no one was there. I called out for Mom but she didn’t answer. I went to the kitchen and ran my hands under cold water, the cuts really weren’t as bad as I thought. It looked like all of the glass had fallen off of my arms at some point but it might’ve just been pushed in deeper. I covered myself in Band-Aids; my hands weren’t shaking anymore. I went upstairs and changed into clean pants and socks after running my red legs under the bath’s faucet. I then went downstairs and sat down in the TV room while I waited for my impending doom. Something else bad was that the notecard I had written the photograph’s backside on was sitting out on the coffee table. Mom must’ve conducted her own investigation on me while I was figuring everything else out. I thought of going into town to try and find her but I was just too tired. I noticed that I was gripping the chair's arms tightly and tried to let go. After about thirty minutes, I decided to go and try to apologize to Manny before I was permanently grounded but Mom entered the house.

“Hi Mom.”

“JESU- Oh, hi Finn. You scared the heck out of me. Where’ve you boys been all night? The Coopers have been getting all worked up.”

“...”

“Ah, yes I found your little secret. I’m guessing Mom gave it to you at some point? I’ve already gone to Mr. Toft about it, we’ll talk in the morning.”

“...”

“...Hun? Oh my goodness! What happened to your hands?!” She sat down in front of me and took my hands in hers, I was leaking out from under my bandages a little.

“Mom I… I went into the bunker.”

It got quiet, I’ve never seen Mom look scared before.

“W-What did you say?”

“I went into the facility out in the woods.”

She laughed, “Come on now sweetie, you know you can’t lie to me I see through all your fibs…”

I just stared at her.

“I know you couldn’t have gotten inside, the whole place has been sealed for years. You couldn’t possibly have been able to-”

“The ceiling on the first floor caved in.”

She stared at me with her mouth open.

I spoke slowly and shakily, “We were looking for the missing knife and the ground fell underneath me. I went inside, the first floor was empty so I took the elevator down to-”

“That’s not possible, the elevator was shut down, it doesn’t work.”

“It worked. There were folding chairs and a trash bin inside. I took the elevator down to level fifty… There was something there. It looked like a dead man. It got up and chased me.”

Mom briefly screamed and covered her mouth, she looked thoroughly traumatized. She went up on her knees and brought me in for an awkward hug. She was crying hard. 

“I’m sorry Mom, I had to go down there. I don’t know why…”

She just kept holding me tight, Grandma said Mom only worked at the desk but she might’ve learnt more about the specifics of the station after her husband was lost to it. She seemed awfully partial to Mr. Toft after all. 

She sat up and held me by the shoulders, “I’m so sorry hun, sit tight we’ll get you some help soon. I have to go call some people and… I’m sorry I let this happen, I’m so sorry. We’ll move far away in the morning I promise, you’ll never have to worry about that place again. Just please hold on, I need to call this in and go tell Carson. Did Manny go home after you both got out?”

“W-what?”

“Was he not with you?”

“No I-I went alone and he was gone when I came out, didn’t he go home?”

She paused like she wasn’t sure what to say, “It’s okay hun the adults will find him just lie down. It’ll be okay. It’ll be okay.” She said it more to herself than to me.

She walked over to the kitchen where she pulled out an ancient cell phone from a drawer that I didn't know existed until now. 

“M-Mom, what’s going on?”

“Sit tight hun, they’re gonna bring someone to go get Manny.” Her face was white with fear and her crazed eyes were focussed on the phone.

“...What?” Manny never went home, he had gone in after me.

She walked out the door while tapping away on the old fashioned phone. The house became silent. I found myself walking back to the bunker again. Before I knew it my feet were upon tile once more, I felt like a zombie. Manny was down here somewhere, he came in after me, he was down here with that thing. The lights were off now, like they were originally. I didn’t care, I knew the way to the elevator and I bumped into it before I knew it. I found the button and pressed it. No response. I kept pressing it, I pressed it a thousand times but there was no elevator coming for me. I tried to push my fingers in between the door to pry it open but I wasn’t strong enough. I ran through the rooms looking for an open vent but I couldn’t find one in the dark and I don’t remember seeing any on this floor. I ran back to the elevator to try and call for it again but it was still silent. My legs gave out and I fell on my bottom. I was in too much shock to cry. Then something caught my attention. There was a reflection of green light and a flashing red against the metal doors of the lift. It was the video camera. I picked it up and found that it was recording the hallway with the night vision mode. I hit stop and went to the media library. 

There were tons of videos I hadn’t seen before, Manny must’ve been doing a lot without me. I watched a few of them and saw clips of birds and rabbits in his yard, some were just ten minutes of clouds passing through the sky. There was a thirty minute video of the rain falling and thunder rumbling. Others were of people walking around and of the diner or county market. Then a few rows all had a similar thumbnail. Each were hour long videos of the entrance to the bunker filmed under night vision, just staring into the room. I fast forwarded through them and saw nothing out of the ordinary. It looked like after the first few he started bringing the tripod with him. Then there was the most recent video. It was forty-eight hours long, I selected the media. 

“-’Orang-urple’, okay?”

“Okay.”

I watched myself enter the facility from the third person. The lights weren’t on in the hallway. I felt vulnerable all of a sudden, I climbed my way back out to the surface to continue. Sitting down with my back to a tree I skimmed through the video. Manny stood there filming the hole for about forty-five minutes. Every once in a while he would whip around at the trees or the bunker doors. After a while he started to hum a weird melody. It was a slow melody with a kind of sad undertone to it, then he started to repeat the same four notes over and over again like a broken record. It was like he was hypnotized. Then there was a sound like bushes aggressively rustling from behind the camera, Manny spun around and screamed. He twitched the camera around looking for the source but there was nothing there. After a few minutes he seemed to have convinced himself that it was all in his head but I knew otherwise. He didn’t resume his humming and instead walked further out into the clearing and filmed the hole from a distance. Eventually he walked up to it and shouted my name, he whipped the camera at the woods again to see if he garnered a reaction but there was none. He was breathing hard. Manny walked to the woods like he was about to go back but he hesitated. Whether it was out of fear of the woods or fear of me dying, Manny entered the bunker for the first time.

His facility was different than mine. The air was thick and foggy, it was hard to see even with the infrared vision. None of the lights were on and the building was completely silent to me other than his heavy breathing. He approached the elevator with careful steps and checked his back before calling out my name back down the hallway. After no response, Manny hit the call button and the cabin was waiting there for him. The lift’s lights were also out but after he stepped inside I saw that the numbers on the control panel were somehow different than the ones I had, except for level fifty and surface. Instead, his were numbered normally from one to fifty, additional buttons were in place for an armory, dormitory, power level, and security room. The architecture was different as well, the elevator looked less like a white hospital lift and more like a luxury hotel one, with a polished wood look and bronze keys jack'o'lanterned with the numbers. The only one that was lit was the security room which he pressed. 

After a shakier than usual trip, Manny was brought to a floor identical to the one from my second expedition. My trash can of vomit was still there and its smell made Manny gag. He walked around it while giving my shame full video coverage. He went to where the computers were and filmed the monitors. This time only one of them was on and it showed multiple grey icons with different names. He hesitated a bit before sitting down and clicking on some of them, they showed security camera footage of different floors. Now the worst part of this is that I know, with certainty, that I have never seen a security camera in my entire time in the facility yet for some reason I was watching someone view live footage of me spinning around in the swivel chair on the power floor. The angle was labelled “PWR\_LVL\_007” which Manny figured out to be the power level. He ran back to the elevator but the buttons only offered the dormitory floor to him, he pushed the dimmed power button many times but it was no use, he settled for the dorms for now. 

During the elevator ride Manny held the camera down to his side but I could hear him coughing and spitting. I felt like spitting when I was on the medical floor so maybe he had that same taste of metal in his mouth. He whimpered a bit and the elevator came to a halt at the dorm floor, which prompted him to return the camera to his eyes. The floor was full of a thick fog or gas of some sort, making it hard to see even with the special camera. The lights were on but they hardly helped. Manny coughed hard and the video shook as he pulled his elbow up to cover his mouth. He hesitated a bit before venturing into the living quarters. The layout seemed to be the same as when I was there, only when he approached the end of the hallway where the cafeteria was supposed to be, he was met with a wall with a massive fissure in it leading into a rocky, earthy cave. Sounds of slow distant footsteps echoed  from the hole in the wall and Manny immediately started to walk backwards to the elevator. 

“Manny… I’m stuck…” It was my voice but with accentless, dictionary pronunciation. Manny jumped and turned towards the elevator, pressing the open button once he reached it. The elevator had moved. He kept pressing it like a crazed child. The bare footsteps transitioned from cave to tile yet the camera couldn’t make out the owner yet.

“W-w-w-what’s the color…?”

“Manny… help me…”

“What’s your favorite color!?”

“It’s beautiful Manny… let me show you…”

“STAY AWAY FROM ME!”

“The song is so pretty… I can bring you to it…”

The silhouette could be seen in the fog, it was way too tall to have been me. Manny kept pushing the button.

Then it was Doog’s voice, “Follow me, you can trust me.”

Manny yelped and the elevator opened. He fell down onto his side and the sound of quick, barefooted steps across tile could be heard. The camera was angled so that I could barely see the entrance and Manny was in the blindspot. A dark leg came into view and stood just outside of the elevator. Manny screamed and cried but he must’ve pressed one of the buttons at some point because the doors closed on it. Whatever it was had just stood there and stared at him, maybe it wasn’t able to enter the cabin or maybe it was just trying to intimidate him, either way it had traumatized Manny. The camera laid on the floor for fifteen minutes; when he reached the next floor he pushed the close door button so he could take a little bit longer to calm down. I don’t know when it happened but while I was watching it I had subconsciously walked back home and found myself sitting down on the curb in front of our homes. All the lights of all the houses were on and people were walking around hurriedly in their pajamas, none of them paid me much attention so I returned to my movie. Manny had made his way to the console I was at and as he stared at it in confusion, the display I had been analyzing jumped out at me and it now read: “38 Supervisor acknowledged Activation 50 success”.

I imagined that at this point I was probably still on level thirty-eight listening to the video logs. Manny paced around the room for a while calling out my name with a shaky, broken voice. Once he was willing to accept that I wasn’t there anymore he went back to the elevator. From what I saw, the room seemed identical to when I was there; the elevator, however, was not identical to when Manny was last there. The buttons had disappeared entirely. Before he could do anything, the elevator doors closed and the lift came to life more literally than before. He started to panic and pound on the walls and door. He dropped the video camera to pick up one of the folding chairs and rammed it into the crack between the door but to no effect. The lift was slowly making its way downwards now, seemingly slower than it usually moved. Manny sat down in front of the camera with his hands over his ears, rocking back and forth slowly while muttering something I couldn’t make out. After a while he noticed the camera again and scrambled over to it. He backed up against the wall opposite to the door and aimed it out like a weapon. 

The doors opened to level fifty and it was almost exactly how I remembered it. The light at the end of the empty room was still on but the soles of evil’s shoes were no longer there. Manny got up quickly and plunged himself into the room out of some compulsion, checking around the corners like a military sweep. The night mode was turned back on but it wasn’t as effective as it was before, in order for night vision to work there needs to be at least some amount of light, and in certain areas of the room there was none, less than none. He took jerky steps forward across the room until he made it to the second elevator, the familiar note was still there scratched into the wall and the gate was now opened. 

“I can hear it… I’m so close now…” He muttered. 

Manny made his way into the cabin like he was familiar with it. He set his camera down behind him and tried to shut the gate in order to descend to Valhalla. It was angled so that I could see all the way out into the dark room, the other elevator was now closed and the singular light was the only source of brightness. The gate seemed to be stuck and Manny was struggling to get it closed, he held on tight and threw himself backwards, propping a leg up on the wall to push off with. It was no use though, the gate was stuck in place. He worked until he was out of breath and fell onto his butt when he ran out of grip. After catching his breath, he gave it one more shot before giving up. He punched the wall hard and kicked it then walked around outside with his hands behind his head in frustration. He was babbling incoherently in a quiet voice. I watched him walk past the entrance a few times and it looked like he was about to try the other elevator again when it opened.

A bright beacon appeared across the room, and a dark silhouette emerged from it. I could see Manny staring at it from outside the cabin. The doors shut and the shadow found its place hidden in the dark, beyond where the night vision had effect. Manny seemed to realize that there was something else on the floor with him now and went back to trying to shut the gate, more frantic than before. He started whimpering and crying as he worked, his head was flicking between the gate and the dark so fast that his glasses flew off, to which he had little reaction. He stepped back and kicked it a few times, he punched it a few more, he stuck his fingers into it but none of it had any effect. His knuckles were scratched and red but he didn’t stop. I’m sure he was filled with the same terror I had sampled before only he had no possible way out where I had had options. 

“PLEASE…! PLEASE!!!”

He started screaming and thrashing about while holding onto the gates handle. It did not offer any mercy. The marionette was now faintly visible from the dark. Its eyes didn’t glow like the cat’s had, they were endless pools of dark. I swear its smile was wider than before, its teeth longer and more uniform. It held its hands behind its back like a teacher about to scold a student. Now in a state of malicious ecstasy at having found new prey after its failed hunt. Manny fell to the ground and scuttled backwards behind where the camera sat. We both watched in horror as the marionette made its way to him. It sounded like Manny was gasping for air as shouts failed in his throat. It slowly creeped up to him with nothing to stop it, then its arms rose patiently, and when it was standing completely over him, it struck like a starved beast, dragging him kicking and screaming out into the light.

Now there’s a part of the story which you might’ve been somewhat skeptical about so far, which was the day we built the snowman. You’ve probably been wondering why I could offer such a detailed description of its decay even though my back was towards it. The truth is that after I witnessed Manny’s fate, my mind essentially broke. A lot of these memories I’ve shared with you became repressed or overwritten by fabrications. I wouldn’t realize most of these until much later in my life and even now I’m still sorting through them. I’d like to think that I’ve been a pretty reliable narrator for the majority of the story, except for whenever I redact the town’s name, withhold the fact that I had an embarrassing lisp, and remove all of Manny’s “witerwawwy”’s (Literally’s). There are moments where I am unintentionally unreliable though. For one, I don’t remember Manny’s real name. “Manny” has just been a placeholder while I write this, I literally took it from Diary of a Wimpy Kid. I expected it to be revealed to me at some point but it never came, I don’t feel like I’m worthy to remember his name. Another is the snowman day. I don’t really know what happened to it, whenever I think about it though the memory plays out from the third person and I witness it as though I was astrally projecting or something. It also plays out in my head when I try to remember what I saw happen to Manny on the video camera that night. As I sat on that curb amongst a town in chaos, I watched the footage of my best friend being mutilated. The snowman’s eyes came off first, ripped out maniacally. One of the arms fell down, broken across the cold tile. Warmth ate away at the body, taking large, voracious bites. It was weakened until it collapsed and was no longer living. It was just like Mrs. Frisk had said, those events will happen again, and they did and will continue to, over and over and over again.

  


Chapter 5 Surface

I don’t know for sure what happened next or in what order. I remember seeing people go up to the Coopers house and Manny’s mom got super angry and hit some people. There was a lot of screaming and I remember seeing her sitting out on the road crying. I remember Mom taking my hand and we got into a car or ambulance or something. I must’ve dropped the camera at some point because I don’t know what happened to it or where it went. I never really got to understand why the video was as long as it was, how it managed to keep its battery full, or how it managed to get back to the surface. A lot of the facilities aspects are still unusual to me now. In some of the memories I recall, I find myself perfectly navigating rooms in the dark, like they had appeared with the lights on to me at the time. I don’t know what the elevator actually looked like either. Carson described particular floors outside of the numbered ones which makes me think that the one I saw on the camcorder was legitimate but it looked so much different than the rest of the architecture while my version was relevant. Then there was also the matter of the music box which didn’t appear to me in the videos or in real life. The more I discovered about the place the more mysteries it created.

I was taken to a hospital where I stayed for about two years. I had become sort of dormant from the experience and was put through therapy and recovery during my time there. Because of this, Mom and I were granted leave from the town and moved away once I was stable enough. Life outside was different but I grew into it eventually. We still received support from the cult/scientist/government people even though I couldn’t recognize it at the time. Mom stuck to her belief that Valhalla should be forgotten and she kept me in the dark when it came to my past that I couldn’t remember. I wouldn’t uncover what had happened in that town until several years later when I was a junior in college. I had taken a couple of gap years after high school so I was going into the year as a twenty-two year old. I really liked horror media and had been reading a lot of online horror stories and the girl I was dating at the time really liked old movies, so I eventually found my way back to George Romero. I had told her I never saw the older version yet when I watched it, it felt very familiar. This set off a chain of memories which would unravel most of what I had forgotten. It also brought back my compulsive clicking and my horrific nightmares.

I drove eight hours home the next morning to confront my mom about it. We got into a huge argument over it and she wouldn’t relinquish any information about it to me. I got mad at her and yelled until she cried then kept yelling. Which leads me to where I am now. I am currently typing this from my old home in the old town. I made my return after almost twelve years. I had an idea of where it was geographically and, after buying the proper camping supplies, hiked my way through the woods circumventing the guards on the main road. It took me four days or so to find it and when I did, I converged at the main road where the stop signs that Bun was talking about were. There were dozens of red octagons lined up on the road in an unusual fashion, just in case you didn’t see the first ones I guess. 

I snuck into Grandma’s house through the back door first. She wasn’t home, the house had been completely abandoned. The messy study and suspicious basement were now vacant of any furniture or effects. Grandma had stayed in town after we left so I wasn’t sure of what happened to her. I went to the closest ally I knew of, which was Doog, but his home was missing entirely. That haunted house was now reduced to an empty grass plot. I didn’t want to go to Sig’s place or Bun’s as their parents might recognize me and cause trouble. Sig’s mom probably wasn’t alive any longer but the thought didn’t really occur to me as the memories were still fresh in my mind. 

I checked my watch and found that it was almost time for school to let out. Mrs. Frisk was probably the only person I could rely on right now, her home was a stone’s toss from Doog’s. I broke in and tried to make myself look as nonthreatening as possible in her living room so as not to give her a heart attack when she came home. I had picked up a pen from her counter and was clicking as I waited. When she did return, she hardly acknowledged me. She just looked at me, sighed, and went to go make some tea in the kitchen. I sat there staring at my shoes while I waited for her. Mrs. Frisk had become a little bit older, her hair was properly greying now and her face was more wrinkly. She sat down in a chair next to the coffee table in front of me and took a quiet sip from her cup, “Hi Finn, welcome back.”

“Mrs. Frisk I’m so sorry about everything, I didn’t…”

She shook her head, “It wasn’t your fault dear, save yourself the guilt.”

I breathed out, “...What happened to this place?”

“Hm? Oh right you wouldn’t know, forgive me. Your grandmother perished from stress and her condition some time after you and your mother departed. She’s buried next to your father, Carson, and Thelma – ah Sigrid’s mom. The Coopers left, whether it was willingly or not I’m not sure, and were replaced with a new family. I got to learn more about Ulrich’s work and I’m now allowed to teach our history again. There have been three new children all of which are prohibited from entering the forest in any capacity. Some adults have taken shifts patrolling around our town to enforce it, although they don’t do too great of a job seeing as you managed to sneak in.”

“What happened to Mr. Toft?”

“Bun happened… and rightfully so. After everything his father had done to him and to everyone here, Bun chose to kill him. He shot him to death in his home and left with the rest of his friends. They burned down Doog’s house and sent out into the woods with him. I don’t know if they’re still alive but we haven’t heard anything about them from the caretakers… Their care for us has continued, Carson’s replacement has confirmed that there’ll be new inmates in town to fill the vacant homes in a few weeks.” I suppose the package we had found in the special place that one day must’ve been the gun he used; I guess I never really understood the Toft household’s relationship outside of Bun hating his dad. It was hard to picture him dead, I couldn’t help but imagine him still grinning masterfully as though he had expected it to happen.

“Are you going back down there, Finn?”

“Yes.”

“...I see. I’m sorry to hear that.”

“Goodbye Mrs. Frisk.”

“Goodbye Finn.”

I got up and headed towards the door. It had started raining out and I became wet once I exited. I decided to make my way over to the graveyard to pay my respects to the dead now that I’d be able to figure out which stone belonged to my dad. I suppose we could actually call it a graveyard now that there were actual bodies in it. I found the three new ones in the back right and saw the stone that would belong to my dad. His real name was apparently “Loki”, ironic as it was, that’s probably why he got so much shit for calling it Valhalla. Frey’s real name was Estelle. I didn’t bother checking the other two as they didn’t really matter to me. There was no grave for Manny.

After I made it back to my nostalgic home I dried off and went to work writing down my memories on the laptop I brought with me. It’s taken me a couple of days but I managed to get it done, I had to sneak out to the sandwich shop a few times for food in the middle of the night and I’ll probably make an attempt at the diner’s pancakes before I descend. Hopefully this won’t get taken down but if someone sees it before it does, that’ll be enough for me. And now that I’m finished, I will return to the bunker. I have to. Thank you for sticking with me and I’m sorry that I can’t offer all of the answers to everything, please don’t seek them out.

“Ah, don’t worry about it son. What brings you to this spot in town, hm? All the entertainment’s on the other side, ya know?”

“Oh I was, um, visiting my grandma.”

“Hm? Visiting old Frey all by yourself? Why you’re certainly a generous boy, Finley. Not many kids’d go outta their way to visit their elders I’d bet. I, for one, haven’t seen my folks, or even their kids, in twenty-nine years and counting. What’d the two a’ ya chat about by yourselves? Cribbage? Knitting, maybe?”

“Oh, I was just asking about her health, she had to go to the hospital out of town and I wanted to make sure she was alright… is all.” I felt like I’d made a mistake lying to Mr. Toft, the second the words left my mouth it seemed like he knew they were fake.

“I see, I see. And how is she doing? I’ve yet to see your Granny, son. Surely she is well?” He grinned.

“Yep, she’s alright. She went to take a nap as she – as I – left.”

“A nap? At this hour? Poor old willow’s gonna ruin her circadian rhythm I’ll tell ya; nothing worse in life than getting bad sleep.”

“Yeah, I suppose she might be on some medication maybe.” I tried to sympathize with his doubt to make my position seem more understandable. He just looked at me patronizingly.

“Now, now Finley. There’s nothing to be ashamed about, being curious and all. Asking questions is what defines us, to refuse is to unbecome. In fact, I’ve got nothing but respect for you and the questions you’ve been asking, as well as the answers you’ve been giving.” He took out a cigarette and lit it, “You’re a clever kid, I’m sure you know by now. It’ll be a shame when you stop asking questions. Take a look at your meemaw for one, she stopped asking those questions and look at what happened to her. A crying shame it was when she stopped, tragic. You wouldn’t do that to me, would ya son? All of us have got our hopes on you and how deep you’ll go. It’d just break my heart to see you end up like my Bjorn or that kid who lives by your grandma. All of us townsfolk are yearning for something great to happen here, even if we haven’t realized it yet, and you might just be that something. Never stop, Finley, I’m counting on you.” He turned to leave and my voice spoke without my consent.

“...Mr. Toft, what is the negative?” He turned towards me and smiled like a wolf.

“Ah, another good question... You see this cigarette? The way the smoke goes up and the ashes down?” He tapped it and cinders fell to the ground. “Well they’re distractions, a red herring. There is nothing to find at the top or the bottom, they are empty, nature's misdirection. I’m not quite sure if you’d believe this, but in his youth, young Mr. Toft was an astronaut. I’ve been to the stars and sat on Ms. Luna, but the only thing there was to do up there was to stare down at the beautiful Mrs. Terra. Space is an empty frontier. There is nothing of value in the cosmos, just a vast emptiness. All the planets, corpses, in comparison to the missus. You can even feel it when you’re there. The lack of sound, taste, smell, all set at zero. Makes me depressed just thinking about it…

“So you’d think the answer, by default, would be down, wouldn’t ya? At the deepest point water sits, there is also nothing. The ocean has its monsters and ghosts past where the sun shies away sure, but they’re still misdirection, a false bottom. Son, if the greatest treasure nature had was some fish, well I’d be quite frustrated with the Mother, that’s for certain. Ya see, she’s a very clever woman and her illusions intertwine themselves in our very being. This natural rule of two you feel, up and down, good and bad, predator and prey. But the two conventional unknowns are nothing next to her secret third, reserved only for the most curious of cats and kittens. Away from feathery heaven and fiery sulfur pits you’ll find the true frontier; inwards through solid stone and metal... Your daddy was a true pioneer, kid. He saw the great frontier, hell, the very valkyrie themselves came and welcomed him. Even now he’s there, in “Odin’s Great Hall” as I’m sure he’d name it. A corpse better than any of us ever will be…”

“But why?! What’s in the frontier?!”

He chuckled and walked past me, the light from his cigarette shining from between his fingers at his side. I felt a gust of wind scrape my face and when I looked down I realized that I had lost track of my stone. It felt like the cogs of this station were fully online all of a sudden, like I had been locked onto some strange path I had yet to understand. I was cold, like the cold you feel when you’re on two hours of sleep and have to make it through a full day of school or work. I returned home and went through to the backyard where I sat and stared into the forest, hugging my knees to my chest. 

The wind shook the trees making a loud rustling sound as the leaves flicked against each other. Then as the sun sank, the trees became dark and menacing. Giant shadows waving their arms above their head in a maniacal fashion. I went inside and walked up the stairs to my bed without realizing my shoes were still on. I laid on top of my covers and stared at the ceiling in the dark, listening to the trees roaring laughter from outside my window. I closed my eyes but there was no tiredness there to guide me into sleep. I went into the front yard and stared down the road. All of the houses’ lights were off and the neighborhood was illuminated only by the moon. I crunched across the grass to the sidewalk and went to my best friend’s home. His room was on the first floor so I went up to his window and knocked on it. No response. I knocked again. A lamp turned on and I could see a startled Manny staring out at me and then relaxing, he went over to unlock the window and open it.

“Hi Finn, what’re you doing?”

“I’m going to the bunker, come with me.”

“W-what?! At this time of night?”

“You said you did it all the time, before.”

“Well, yeah but I don’t anymore. Why are you going?”

“I need to.”

“Um, okay? I’m not going back there after what happened last time. You definitely shouldn’t go by yourself.”

“I need someone to go with me.”

“...Can we do it tomorrow?”

“No it has to be now.”

“Why? Why are you being so weird? Are you alright?”

“I talked to Grandma and she told me what was down there. I can’t wait any longer. Please come with me.” 

“What did she say?”

“She told me about the bottom.”

“The… The bottom? The bottom of what?”

“The bottom of the facility! What else?! There’s something down there she wouldn’t let me know about, I have to go find it.”

“Dude, don’t yell, you're gonna wake Mom and Dad up. You’re being super weird I don’t know if I should-”

“Manny please. My dad is down there, they left him behind. I need to do anything I can. He might still be there.”

“... Finn, it’s been like eleven years since the incident, your dad is probably…”

“...”

“Fine… let me grab my things first, I’ll meet you behind your house in five.”

“Thank you, Manny.”

I walked back over to my house and sat on the couch inside, staring at the blank TV for five minutes. I’m pretty sure I left the door open. I didn’t have a flashlight but Manny would have his and probably the video camera as well. I walked out the back and saw him standing there, “Ready?”

“Uh yeah, I had to make sure the batteries were good on the flashlight… Are you sure about this?”

I didn’t say anything, I just walked into the forest. I didn’t even need to see where I was going, I felt like something was holding my hand and guiding me through the woods and down the path.

“Hey…! Wait up!”

I kept walking.

I stood above the hole and stared down into the building, the lights in the hallway were still on. Either Manny didn’t notice them or something had flicked the switch back on. The quiet of the area hardly bothered me anymore but my fingers were lightly snapping subconsciously anyways. Manny caught up to me in a second, panting. 

“Finn… Gimme a sec.”

“I’m going down.”

“WAIT! Would you please… calm down for a minute?”

“I can’t Manny. I need to go down there.” My hands were shaking.

“I don’t… I can’t go down there, Finn. I’m sorry I just can’t do it. What if that thing is still down there? The thing that killed that guy on level fifty? Or the thing that was copying you?”

“We’ll deal with it.”

“What do you mean we’ll ‘deal with it’?! Do you hear yourself?! You’re going to – we’re going to die if we go down there Finn!”

“Ugh, fine. Give me the flashlight. Wait here and if I’m not back in one hour, go get help, okay?”

“NO! This is absurd! I can’t just-just let you kill yourself! What about our movies?! What about Doog and Bun and-and-and-”

“I need to do this otherwise I can’t have those things. It’ll just take me an hour and then we can put it all behind ourselves. Please…”

“Finn, I worked so hard to get you out of that hole last time, please don’t go back in…”

“...”

“You’re not yourself! How do I know you’re not just some… some imposter or something?! Did the real Finn ever leave that day?! I don’t get it!”

“Manny, I’m sorry. I can’t explain it properly, I just need you to trust me on this. I need to do this. Please.”

“...One hour… If I don’t see your face in one hour I’m waking up your mom and she’s going to ground you forever…” It looked like he was checking the camcorder for the time.

“Thank you… And if someone is using my voice again, ask them what my favorite color is. If it’s me, I’ll say ‘orang-urple’, okay?”

“Okay.”

I took the flashlight and sat down on my butt to lower myself into the facility for the last time.

  


Chapter 4 The Abyss

I made my way out into the corridor and looked back at Manny one last time. I wondered if he could even see that the lights were on in the hallway right now. I was going to check my watch to keep track of the time but I felt like it wouldn’t matter, I didn’t know if I’d even be returning and the elevator ride to Asgard was supposedly hours long. It’d probably be better if I didn’t stress myself out with a time limit anyways. I marched towards the elevator and hit the call button once again; this time the cabin was waiting for me. I didn’t bother trying to figure out if it had been taking trips in my absence, I just went inside and looked at the keys. The same floors were lit as last time although level fifty was still dimmed. Maybe I’d be able to figure out a way to unlock it on one of the other floors I thought. Carson mentioned Arvid needed a code to lock the elevator from the power level, maybe I’d be able to figure out how to reset the system or something. Only I had no idea what the code would be. I pressed nineteen first and the elevator came to life.

Floor nineteen seemed to be a dorm floor with multiple bedrooms, bathrooms, and even a cafeteria. The lights were out though so I had to make use of Manny’s flashlight, I’m very grateful that he mentioned changing the batteries. The dorms were small closets each with a loft bed over a desk area, clothes hangers hung down from the bed frames, some still had lab coats and shirts on them. A few of the rooms still had their owner’s belongings as well, a desk in one of the rooms had a laptop and a picture frame with a photo of two smiling parents holding a baby. The laptop’s battery was dead and I didn’t want to think too much about who the people in the photograph were. There were several vending machines along the corridor, each selling breakfast bars or those tiny disposable bowls of cereal. “Selling” probably wasn’t the right word as they were free. I pressed the buttons for a Lucky Charms bowl and it fell down without asking me for any payment, the door to the drop box was jammed though so I left them there. At the end of the hall was the cafeteria. Multiple tables with attached benches had been folded up and rolled into the corner, like the place was closed for the night. You could still see into the kitchen, however, and after getting scared by my torch’s reflections off the counter, I entered it. There was a foul smell, most likely from all of the rotting food left behind. I walked around the island counter and looked at what was on the ground.

It was here that I found the remains of the Christensens’ cat. Whether it was by choice or not, Meowbles had somehow ended up on the tile of the facility's kitchen on level nineteen. She was laid on her back and her legs and eyes were missing, however there were no insects making a meal of her or any other signs of decomposition. A pool of blood wrapped around a can of cat food and a can opener on the ground, like someone had been feeding her, or more likely, luring her. If I wasn’t so on edge, the sight would’ve probably made me cry. The only thing I could think was that this was definitely a threat. My thinking was interrupted by a soft, metallic, thudding sound coming from the ceiling. It sounded like there was something moving in the vents above my head. I looked around and found that there was an opening in the wall where a vent cover had been removed and was sitting on the ground next to it. It could’ve just been the compound settling but I didn’t want to take any chances with an AC monster so I ran back to the elevator and re-entered the cabin.

I pressed the button that was next in order, which was thirty. At some point during my dark elevator ride, everything shook and it came to a complete stop before my destination. I turned my flashlight on and tried to figure out what was going on. After the fear of being trapped in an elevator shaft forever started to sink it, the mechanisms whirred back into action and it continued like nothing had happened. I began to feel like something was watching me more intently than before. It felt as though I had been beaten in my race for control of the elevator and the victor was taunting me. My descent continued and I prepared for something to be waiting for me on the thirtieth floor when the doors opened. I was stood up, however, and my suicide mission was allowed to continue. 

This floor seemed to be the power room that was mentioned on the transmission. Carson said that someone named Arvid was here during the incident which I’m pretty sure is Mrs. Hansen as I remember people saying that name in the diner. The floor was a large maze of large grey boxes and tubes and wires. The hanging lights here seemed to be partially working, blinking on and off regularly; I decided to use the intermittent illumination over my flashlight just in case I needed a few more seconds of light later on. At the end of the maze was a long desk with computers installed into it, a rolling office chair was knocked over on the ground. The control panel was covered in a ridiculous amount of buttons, switches, keypads and green and red lights. Any hope of solving the elevator malfunction fell away from me, I picked the chair up so I could sit on it and pout. After staring at all of the devices for a while I noticed that one of the computer screens had moving text on it. The tube screen was old fashioned and the text was a bit shaky and hurt my eyes if I stared at it too hard, especially when the ceiling lights blinked off, but it read:

\*Command failure Activation 50 denied Contacting administrator…

\*Error Administrator not found Contacting 38 supervisor…

\*Error Address offline Please reinstate manually

Activate 50 \[Y\]

\*Command failure Activation 50 denied Contacting administrator…

And it kept going like that on its own, I figured it must’ve been caught in some computer catch twenty-two or something. It seemed like it was trying to contact someone on floor thirty-eight, presumably, so I figured I might be able to help it escape its digital paradox if I went there myself. I was so desperate to go down to the launch pad that anything that smelled of hope was good enough for me.  When I returned to the elevator it was loyally waiting for me, that thing in the vents of floor nineteen must still be up there I figured, if I made a return trip I might be putting myself at greater risk. I just now noticed that floors thirty-eight and thirty-nine were neighbors, maybe there’d be a staircase between the two. I pushed the button and the system lurched back to life to lower me eight more stories. 

As it was going, I noticed something was in the velcro pocket of my cargo pants: a pocket knife, or more precisely, THE pocket knife. I don’t remember taking it with me or leaving it in my pants at all, in fact I’m not even sure if I took it back with me after my first adventure in the bunker. I opened the tool and felt the rusty ruined blade, there was supposed to also be a serrated saw but it had been snapped off at some point. I traced the spot on my hand where I had scratched myself half a year ago in an edgy manner. It was a bad idea, however, and when the elevator shook to a halt the knife slipped across my hand leaving an actual big cut this time. The petty knife had disappeared from my sight once more and left me with a parting gift. Luckily, floor thirty-eight seemed to be a medical center of sorts. There were functional lights, humming as they illuminated a disastrous hallway.

There was an opened first aid box on the wall whose contents were spilled onto the ground, a roll of bandages had rolled away into a nearby room; a gurney was full of stacks of binders with important looking documents inside, some of which had torn from their three punched holes and were scattered onto the ground, and a light at the end of the hallway had broken and its glass was spread on the tile in front of a dark room. It reeked of sanitizer and chemicals, I could almost taste metal in my mouth. I grabbed some bandages off of the floor and wrapped them around my hand then struggled to bite it off. There weren’t any tears from me, even though I’ve cried at less, I think I was in some weird state of shock at this point. I looked down at my hands and they were shaking very badly, I thought of abandoning everything and going back but I was too far in, Manny might’ve already gone to get the adults and this could become my last opportunity to explore. 

I followed the trail of bandages into the room with the open door and found a very normal looking check up room, although I hadn’t been to an actual hospital yet, so it was pretty unusual looking to me. There was another room across from it but it was stuck behind the gurney and I couldn’t figure out how to unlock the wheels, I assumed it was probably just the same layout. The room next to it had a big window which let me look into it. The lights were off so it was a bit hard to see but it looked kind of like Grandma’s lab inside; I tried the door and it was locked. The room across was similar but I became distracted by the room at the end of the corridor, a blue light was spread across the wall. 

Side stepping past the broken glass led me into a lounge/office type of room. There was a leather loveseat and some other furnished chairs next to a coffee table with a vase of withered flowers on it. On the other side of the room was a desk covered in office paraphernalia: a mess of sticky notes with terrible handwriting on them, a toppled over cup of pens and pencils, and a laptop with its brightness turned up too high. Instead of an office chair, a wooden stool sat beneath the work station and behind it was another open ventilation shaft. I became like a deer in headlights but after listening for a while, there were no scratching or thudding sounds resounding from the opening. I hesitantly pulled the stool out and sat down at the desk.

The laptop had a document pulled up on it, whoever used this computer had set the warmth to the coldest setting making the white sheet look blue. It had several wires running from it into the wall which I’d assume is why it was still powered. I tried reading a couple of the sticky colored notes on the screen’s border but they were illegible. I attempted to exit out of the document but it was taking very long to load, I eventually caved and pushed the restart button. The laptop’s overworked fans finally took a much deserved break, only to start up again a few seconds later; the document was slightly burned into the screen. The start up greeted a Dr. Junge, a last name I was unfamiliar with, and asked them for a password. I now had to decode the many scribbled memorandums in search of the code. 

It took me a while but I finally found it. It wasn’t on one of the sticky notes but was instead on a keychain that was hidden in the desk, it was one of those digital ones that gives you a new code every few minutes. I typed the amalgamation of numbers, letters, and symbols into the bar and I was in. I was on a screen that looked kind of like a file folder but I was more distracted by the ninety-nine plus notifications pop up in the corner. Then another pop up took over the screen, it said something to the effect of: “Verify 50 activation Y or N”.

I pressed “Y” on the keyboard and it then asked me to scan my keycard, or Dr. Junge’s keycard, I suppose. I had found it earlier in my plundering, his face was definitely one I hadn’t seen before, he was probably one of the Einherjar. I noticed a scanner, similar to the one from the security floor, had fallen behind the desk. I scanned the barcode on the card and then a password terminal was filled with many asterisks. I hit enter to submit and I was met with a success message. Now I, hopefully, just had to go back to the elevator and I’d be on my way. That was until something on the screen jumped out at me, one of the icons on the homepage was a folder named “Frey”. Mr. Toft mentioned that Grandma’s name was Frey earlier today and this might contain the secrets she was hiding from me. I debated ignoring it and just going to the launch pad but there might’ve been something very important in it so I double clicked the icon. Multiple video and image files were inside the folder, each being named after a date from over twelve years ago. I clicked on the first video. 

A younger Grandma with brown hair was sitting on the couch that was right next to me only with the lights on and she was wearing a white labcoat. It took me a few seconds to realize that the volume was off so I had to turn it up a bit to hear what was happening, “-so please continue.” An off screen male voice.

“I equipped the anti-LE77 safety suit and my lab partner attached the tether to the rear. After she left, I heard the sounds of the air lock activating and I was instructed over comms to move forward. The pings of my suits sonar were operational although the heat control was incompetent, I was very cold. The control room noticed this and offered to postpone but I refused.”

“Why did you refuse, Frey?”

“I felt that if I went back I wouldn’t have been brave enough to return.”

“I understand, go on.”

“The tether gave me slight resistance but it helped me maintain my direction. I walked forward for about two minutes. I described what my senses were witnessing to the control team, they suggested I try and take a sample of the soil underneath my feet. I scooped up some of the earth with my tools and placed it into my gathering bag. They asked me for descriptions of what I was hearing, I responded with ‘nothing’. They suggested I return to which I complied. Entering the habitat again, it was hard to see at first. It was like I had pushed down on my eyes very hard and it took me a moment to adjust. In total I was in the zone for about five minutes.”

“And how did you feel afterwards?”

“Relieved. My team was proud of me and I felt happy.”

“How about during your ascension?”

“I reflected on the expedition and was satisfied with my job.”

“That’s good to hear, don’t forget to write up your report and submit it to your daughter by no later than Friday. Thank you, Frey.”

“Thank you, Dr. Junge.”

These seemed to be the psychological reports Grandma was talking about, she said that the fourth trip was the one where everything went bad so I skipped to that one.

“Good evening Frey, have your dreams been getting any better lately?”

“...No, Dr. Junge.”

“I understand that the previous expedition was very stressful for you, would you please describe it to me?”

“Yes. We had a full schedule so everyone was present to watch my excursion. Pretty standard at first: got into the death suit, all tethered up, and out into the dark I went. From my previous trips we had discovered a new route which took me off course, this time I would be walking to the left after about 505 feet. We wanted to keep exploring the Well but there wasn’t much I could do, our tests revealed that it was much more than a mile deep and much deeper than the initial chasm. We had ditched the sonar as it was too unreliable and I was instead going to be experimenting with a walking stick. I preferred the sonar, even if it was faulty, because the stick could get stuck in the soil and would shake my balance at times, it’d feel like someone was grabbing my stick and I didn’t like it. I had also grown comfortable with the sonar’s pings. They never got around to fixing the heat control but I had gotten used to the cold, it was like stepping into a demonic ice bath every other week… After the turn I walked for five minutes. The team requested that I turn around but I wanted to continue, I felt like I was close to something important.”

“What do you mean by ‘something important’?”

“I don’t know.”

“...Continue.”

“At thirteen minutes and forty nine seconds I heard something. I wasn’t sure what it was and I thought I imagined it or that control might’ve bumped into the push to talk or something. I stopped walking and asked for confirmation that we were still connected and they replied. I walked forward and bumped into something, it startled me and I dropped the stick. I should’ve seen it with my stick when I was walking forward so I figured that I missed it... I…”

“Frey?”

“Yeah, gimme a second…”

“Do you want to take a break?”

“No, just go grab me a water.”

“Of course.”

Her hands were on her knees and she was staring straight at her feet, when the doctor returned she sat back and chugged the water bottle.

“Are you ready to continue?”

“Yes… I reached out with my hand to observe the wall or stalactite I had run into but I grabbed onto an arm. A human arm. The shock and confusion took the breath out of my lungs. And then it grabbed onto my arm, with perfect coordination, even in the dark. I screamed into the comm and begged them to retract. It was a bit of a blur but we broke free and I was quickly dragged across the ground back to Asg- the habitat. I didn’t hear it follow me.”

“What happened next?”

“The suit had torn when I was being dragged and I struggled to rip the tattered mess from my body as I sat in the air lock. My vision hadn’t returned yet and I was very stressed. When the doors opened I crawled in and threw up on the ground, it was very embarrassing… After calming down I relayed what I had witnessed to the group and was comforted by them. We agreed to postpone my next trip indefinitely.”

“How about the ascension?”

“I felt sick. I kept thinking about a person living in the caves down here. I wanted to never come back.”

“And are you planning to leave V1H11?”

“C’mon Gunnar, you know I can’t do that.”

“But if you could?”

“...I’d stay. I can’t explain it but I want to go back there now. I remember the fear and everything but maybe my curiosity is too high or something? I felt like I was on the brink of something great while I was down there, I don’t want to give it up.”

“I understand, is there anything else I can do for you?”

“Do you have anything I can take for the dreams?”

It ended there. She found another human in the cave? That’s what was so important everything had to be shut down? Surely there was more to it. The next date wasn’t for a couple of months, I checked my back to make sure nothing was creeping up on me from out of the vent and hit play.

“Well, it has been a while Frey. Please tell me how you have been doing since our last visit. I've heard rumors that you’ve been spending weeks in the habitat at a time.”

“They’re true.” She did not look good, her hair was dirty and her eyes were very tired.

“That’s not good, why would you do this?”

“I need to understand it.”

“What is it that you need to understand?”

“The doppelgangers.”

“I’m sorry, I’ve been out of the loop on the details of what happens down there lately, please elaborate.”

“On our last visit I told you about the human in the abyss. I was wrong, it did in fact follow me back. We still had cameras and floodlights outside from the early days, although they’re mostly useless so no one checks them, but my son-in-law checked them out of curiosity a few days after and he very faintly saw… me! But it wasn’t me! It was an imitation of me! And it was a very poorly made imitation at that. The entire face was a mouth, a slanted grin took up the entire front of the head, it was ridiculous. And one of its arms was so long that it touched my- its toes. It stood there staring at the camera for who knows how long. The strange part, or the stranger part, was that it had clothes, my clothes. It didn’t imitate the late anti-LE77, it imitated MY clothes. Like the clothes I wear every day. The boy freaked out and almost let it enter Asgard but Lars was watching from the security room and stopped him. 

“This became the next interest of our group and we worked to understand it. Although there was more than just one. After everyone went to review the footage, that…-guy-whose-name-I-can’t-remember saw another face in the back. It was like those haunted photos you hear about online! This one was of poor old Ulrich, his legs were way taller than they should’ve been. We got to use our rovers again for once, mounting as many lights on them as possible to overcome the dark. Thankfully the dark near base wasn’t as bad as deeper in and we could almost perfectly view them with help from the floodlights. A lot of us had this feeling that we were being watched by something while we were down there and this proved it to be more than paranoia. Ulrich had never been into the cave yet something had copied him down to his untied shoes. The doppelgangers never reacted to the rover or light or whatever other stimuli we threw at them, they were just watching us. There was something vaguely threatening about them though, so I don’t think we’ll be sending any more of us out there… It gives me the chills to think about what would’ve happened to me if he didn’t notice it.”

“Hm, this is very interesting. How have you been doing outside of work?”

“There hasn’t been much ‘outside of work’. I’ve been spending most of my time down there. My sleep has been very bad, the medication you gave me hasn’t helped at all.”

“I’ll write you a new prescription later. This whole event has been affecting your health negatively, Frey. You’ve been shaking since you started talking, you look very underfed, and are unkept. I’m going to have to give you a week's leave from work so that you can reconnect with the surface.”

“W-what? You can’t do that, I need to be down there Gunnar.”

“No, you want to be down there. You need to take care of yourself, if you don’t it’ll affect the quality of your work and may compromise your partners’ safety.”

“...Fine. I guess I have become slightly obsessive.”

“Take up a hobby or something to keep yourself busy. I’m sure your daughter would love to come visit you and see that you’ve started a garden. She’s been very worried about you.”

“Is that so?” 

“Yes, it is. I would go see them after we’re done here if I were you, they might have some interesting news to share.”

She sighed.

“Let’s cut it short for today, we can continue in a week once you’ve recovered. Is there anything else I can do for you?”

“...Just the meds’ll do, thanks.”

“Of course.”

The next one was about a month and a half out, despite Grandma’s promise to continue in a week. I was captivated by the videos so I continued, completely forgetting about the launch pad below me.

“Frey, are you doing okay?” She looked even worse this time, somehow. Her hair was starting to grey a bit now.

“No.”

“Would you like to tell me about it?”

“...No.”

“Has the medication been working at all?”

“...”

“I understand that you’ve been having some problems with the work lately. I was told that you attempted to sabotage some of the research you had done and that you intentionally ruined an anti-LE77 safety suit. Can you please help me understand why?”

“Gunnar… We have to leave.” Her voice was monotone and low, barely above a whisper.

“Excuse me?”

“We have to stop this project. We have to leave.”

“Why do we have to do that?”

She had been lying back on the couch but sat up and stared into the camera.

“...There was another one that showed up a week ago…”

“And that would make how many of these doppelgangers?”

“Twenty-six now… one for each of us and an additional.”

“Why does this additional require us to abandon ship, Frey?”

“I can’t… I don’t know. It’s just bad. It doesn’t look like any of us, I don’t know what it’s mimicking.”

“Describe it for me.”

“...Teeth... And…” She was shaking her head and breathing hard.

“Frey, please calm down, you are safe here. I am sorry for overstepping my boundaries. If you’d like, we can continue another time.”

“No, I just need a moment. Water… please.”

“Right away.”

He set the bottle onto the coffee table but Grandma just stared at it.

“It’s been appearing in my dreams now. It’s been appearing in my mind at work… I get this overwhelming feeling of dread. The Well, it’s calling for me... That, and whatever Carson was sent here to find. I told my partners about what’s going to happen, what it’s going to do, and they just stare at me like I’m… ”

“Is it alright if I ask for you to elaborate?”

“No.”

“I understand, I’m sorry.”

She uncomfortably twisted in her seat, “Those kids with sparkles in their eyes saw it first, they talked about what they would nickname it. One said ‘Jeremy’ another said ‘The Doppelmaster’ but I knew when I saw it that it was named ‘marionette’. Not like it was an actual puppet, that was just what it was. The others tried to humanize it, giving it gendered pronouns and such, like it deserved anything more than an ‘it’. It made me sick. That abomination was waiting there for us, watching me as I made my little adventures in through the shadows, I’m sure of it. I just don’t understand…”

“Frey?”

She looked at where I figured he was off screen with a serious face, “Gunnar, they’re reconfiguring the scheduling. Carson’s going to come in here and ask you to move down there full time to watch over them while they do their work, it’s more efficient if they don’t have to take as many elevator trips. You have to tell him no.”

“I will take it into consideration, I assure you. Thank you, Frey.”

“You have to get them out of there… please.”

“I will look into it and do what I can.”

She stared at him intently then got up and left, the video ended.

There weren’t any other videos in the folder, other than the second and third expedition, and all of the documents were photocopies which were written in illegible handwriting. It dawned on me that I had been neglecting the vent behind me. I slowly turned around on the chair, sweat forming on my brow, and was met with nothing. The vent creature must not be able to go between floors. Remembering floor thirty-nine reminded me that I never found that staircase, I figured I’d just have to use the elevator. It had definitely been more than an hour since I entered the super structure, I wondered what was happening on the surface. Grandma's depiction of ambulance and firetruck lights against a foggy sky passed through my mind. I felt very homesick all of a sudden. Maybe it wouldn’t be that bad getting yelled at by all the adults and sent to the evil cult’s jail. I thought of Manny and how I yelled at him and it made me want to cry. I felt that I had dug deep enough, I was done asking questions now. That second elevator was a one way trip and if all that was down there was something so horrific that it could make Grandma cry and shout, I’d rather not pay it a visit. I just don’t get why she wouldn’t tell me about it, then again even I wasn’t able to tell Manny about that thing. If I did go back to level fifty the corpse might not be as docile this time. The adrenaline had worn off while I sat there at the computer and the pain from my hand came back to me, that knife was rusty as hell, I probably had an infection or something. 

I walked past the broken glass again and went to the elevator. I reached out to touch the call button when I stopped. The elevator was moving again. I backed up and thought about where I should hide when a ding struck my ears, the doors slid aside against my wishes. It stood in the dark confines of the elevator cabin. Its head was almost touching the ceiling. Black shoes met black slacks which were upon unnaturally tall legs. Its arms swung down next to them in a predatory way. Green business suit and a black tie until you reached the face. A yellow, toothy, haunting grin matched with pale greenish flesh. Its wide, threatening eyes were offering me all of its attention. We stood there – even referring to it under the same pronoun as me makes my skin crawl – the marionette and I stood there for a few seconds. I was too scared to pee myself or do anything. It was a corpse, I was right next to it on level fifty, surely someone propped it up in the elevator to scare me or something. It extended its leg. I flinched backwards. It raised its too-long arms out in front of itself like it was poised to grab me in a bear hug when it was within distance of me. I tried to run but my body wasn’t listening to my mind, then the sulfurous stench made its way to my senses like smelling salts. I sort of stumbled and hobbled backwards toward the psychology room like a newborn deer. ",1,1758059553.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1niuwhj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1niuwhj/our_valhalla_part_4/,Our Valhalla part 4,"There was something else that I wanted to ask my mom about but I was a bit afraid to. After everything that I’d found out, I became very skeptical of my dad. There was apparently some huge tragedy that happened with the scientists which resulted in around twenty-five people disappearing, although Mom and Grandma were supposedly a part of a team that was heavily involved in it and they were fine. I never got to actually see my dad, and I was starting to fear that he was one of the casualties. Mom had always told me that he was doing scientist stuff abroad which seems like it might violate the rule that people aren’t allowed to leave but then again, Mom and Grandma just went out of town no problem. The story was always that we were using his income to live in town but now it seems as though Mom doesn’t really need money for anything since the government people give us everything for free. The more I thought about it the more confused I became, surely it’s not possible for everyone to go along with a lie of that proportion. The real answer was most likely something in the middle: maybe Mom and Dad split up after the incident and Mom didn’t want to tell me about it because the cause could have been related to the tragedy. Grandma seemed to have had some similar sort of situation with Grandpa a long time ago, I didn’t even know Grandpas or divorces were a thing until Mom told me about them. At the end of the day, it was the least of my worries. I was due for a caffeine enhanced marionette nightmare, there was no use in putting it off any further.

Since I wasn’t going to be able to make any progress on my side of the investigation for another week, I decided it was only fair to help Manny out with Doog. I got a few crappy hours of sleep and woke up around eleven. Mom was still awake and was watching something on TV when I came down, I suppose the coffee’s power was fading off as she didn’t even notice me going out through the front door. I hopped over to the convenience store first to buy an energy drink for the first time, thanks to Mr. Toft I had a dollar fifty of extra spending money. It tasted like carbonated piss but it had enough sugar to be stomachable. Lately it felt like sleep was just making me more tired so I felt I’d have to get used to this taste.

The rain had started to become more intermittent and there would be small breaks during the day, the wind was still pretty brutal though. I dragged my feet over to the Coopers’ and knocked on their door only to find out that Manny was already at Doog’s place. Doog lived a few houses down from Grandma so back across the town I went. I could tell which house was Doog’s as the muffled sound of Gojira’s “Ocean Planet” was audible from anywhere on the block, you simply had to walk towards the vibrations to find it. 

Doog’s house was the worst looking in the neighborhood: his lawn had seen some neglect, the windows were filthy and smoke stained, and the lights were off inside giving it an abandoned look. I would have felt bad for his neighbors but the two houses next to him were empty and Grandma’s hearing wasn’t good enough for the nuisance to disturb her, probably. An anxious Manny was sitting on the front steps, holding his head while his knees held his elbows. 

I slammed the rest of the piss beverage and went to greet him, “Hi.”

“Hi Finn.”

“What’s up?”

“I’m not sure how to get to Doog, I tried knocking on his door but I don’t think he can hear me with the music. I don’t want to just barge on in.” 

“Let’s just go get Bun to help, he might not even need us to do anything for him this time. I’m kinda scared to go in there by ourselves anyways.” I could see piles of trash through one of the windows by the door.

“...Fine, I feel bad for relying on him though.”

“I don’t think Bun feels that way, he seems to just do whatever’s the most entertaining for him. He probably forgot Doog even existed and will be grateful when we remind him.”

Finding Bun was easier said than done, there was nowhere that he regularly frequented which meant that he could be anywhere. One could go days without spotting the silly man. Jonas at the movie theater said he hadn’t seen him, he wasn’t covering at any of the stores, and we didn’t run into him at all on our way around town. I thought that he might be at home but Manny told me that Bun mentioned his Dad would kick him out of the house during the day. Bun mentions someone named Sig a lot, so we thought she might know something of his Saturday routine. She lived at the end of our block on the tip of the cul-de-sac, back when the parents had a book club Mom would frequent their house every Sunday. I suppose she used to be in school a few years ago but I don’t really remember the big kids too much, from my understanding she was one or two years older than Bun.

We knocked on their door and when it opened the oldest lady ever was behind it. “Ohh\~ hello children! What brings you two over to our home, yes?” She spoke with a soft, shaky, elderly voice.

“Hi, is this where Sig lives?” Manny asked with a polite smile.

“Oh, are you boys Sigrid’s friends? How wonderful! Yes, yes, let me go and get her for you- SIGRID TWO MORE OF YOUR BOYFRIENDS ARE HERE TO SEE YOU, THEY SAY THEIR NAMES ARE- what did you two say your names were?”

“Um… Manny and Finn”

“THEIR NAMES ARE MANNY AND FINN, THEY HAVE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING IMPORTANT…” 

She paused to listen for a second, “I TOLD YOU TO KEEP THAT GODDAMN DOOR OPEN!!! She’ll be down in a moment dearies, yes, mmhm.” 

She had short red hair and was wearing an overall with nothing else underneath when she came to see us. Freckles covered her face and she had an eyebrow slit on her right side; her eyes were heterochromic, with one being light blue and the other green, but it could’ve just been a rebellious colored contact lens. She took a weird smelling cigarette out of her mouth before she spoke, “Whaddya brats want? I’m not interested in buying any girl scout cookies.”

“We were wondering if you knew where Bun was.” I asked.

“Well I know where he is, but I’m not done with him yet. I’ll send ‘im your way in an hour or so, where d’ya need him?” 

Manny wasn’t saying anything and was staring at his feet so I continued, “We’re trying to talk to Doog but he’s not answering his door.”

“Mmmm… that’s not good. I’ll cut Bun loose a bit early today, just to be safe. Find a bucket or something to hold a lot of water in and wait outside Doog’s house. Also…” She took a drag of the smelly cigarette, ""...Don't tell Momma that we’re friends, she gets confused easy. And make sure Bun knows we ain’t done yet and that I own his Sunday now, too.” 

“Uhh… okay?”

“Great, tell Doog I said hi.” She shut the door in our faces.

Grandma had a Home-Depot-style bucket outside her house for collecting weeds when she was gardening. We threw the weeds away and rushed over to Doog’s place down the sidewalk, expecting Bun to be there any minute. After twenty minutes of waiting, Manny was sitting on the front steps again with me next to him. The bucket was placed under the rain since water was apparently a crucial resource when venturing into the shut-in's domain. We sat there listening to the muffled sound of Doog’s mixtape over the rain: Prog metal turned into grunge eventually and then into hip hop and then to whatever genre Evanescence is. 

The rain cleared up a bit as the sun was beginning to set and when we finally figured Bun had forgotten to come see us, the flanneled man appeared. Bun was stumbling towards the property with both hands carrying gallons of milk; he was panting and out of breath. He set the milk down and fell onto his knees and hands before he had finished crossing the road. We just walked out onto the road and stared down at him while he tried to catch his breath. We figured he was going to throw up or pass out or something when he forced himself to get back up and gave one of his milks to me, “Huhhh… hold onto this for a sec… you…” He sort of pointed at Manny, “Bring the bucket.” He used the railing as he slowly ascended the steps, “DOOG!” He pounded on the door, “DOOG…! Fuck, hey guys this is gonna suck, follow my lead and don’t touch any needles or anything weird looking, okay? Give me the bucket, you can have the other milk.” If he wasn’t so pathetically out of shape I probably would have been surprised with how serious he became. Bun tried to open the door but it was stuck on something, he set the bucket down and threw his shoulder into the door until it started to open a little bit. He reached his hand around the door to throw whatever obstacle that was there out of the way then got back up and took the bucket inside with him. Bun turned the speaker off with his foot, which was in the first room, while he balanced the bucket in his hands. We followed close behind, wondering what on earth was going on and what we needed milk for. 

Doog’s house was beyond filthy: there were dirty clothes, trashbags, and bottles lying on the ground against the walls, a table in the living room was covered in needles, a weird glass vase, and a giant brick cell phone that looked like it came from the 80’s, and the walls were yellowed and ruined by years of second hand smoke. None of the lights were on and it stunk to high heaven and low hell. We had to navigate around caltrops made of broken bottle glass mixed with shards of a shattered picture frame as we went down the hallway towards the rooms at the back. This setting didn’t play into anything fantastical or terrifying that I had experienced before, it just felt lonely and sad. Bun kept shouting Doog’s name as we hastily worked our way in, to his surprise a door at the end of the hallway cracked open and the home’s owner slid out into the hallway. 

He hung his head a bit and if I could see his eyes I’m sure they would look tired. 

“Hey Doog.”

“Hey Bun,” his voice was way deeper than you would have expected, it was growly even.

“You doing okay? Are you going over?”“I’m proper… Did you bring kids in here?”

“Yeah, they were worried about you after you didn’t answer your door.”

“I never answer my door…”

He looked at me and then at Manny, I think. 

“The tire swing kid, ugh. Gimme a second.” He went back into his room to sit down, Bun followed him and told us to take the bucket outside. After dumping it into his already muddy lawn and setting it on the sidewalk I went back in to eavesdrop, although Manny didn’t want to intrude on them and waited outside. I tip-toed my way in, making sure not to step on anything loud. I squatted down and put my ear next to the hinges of the cracked door so I could listen to them unseen.

“ –cemetery, he needed the rope for something I guess.” A deep voice.

“Mmm, we did stupid shit like that when we were their age, makes ya kind of nostalgic.” A relaxed yet serious voice.

“They don’t even know, Bun.”

“I know… I’m sure they’re trying to though, that’s probably why they’re bugging you in the first place. Do you still have your visits?”

“No, I haven’t since winter ended…”

“Good, good. Yo, do you remember little Ella? We were talking about something and your name popped up. She’s still fangirling over you if you can believe it, she’s always asking me what music Doog’s listening to right now and when you’ll be out next and what color your underwear is.”

“...”

“I haven’t seen you in almost a month, are you getting any better? You’ve got Sig and the gang worried again.”

“Yet none of you ever stop by.”

“Don’t act like you’re an inviting host or something, it’s not easy coming in here on your own ya know? Look at all I had to go through to get to you.”

“...”

“...You know my dad gets notified whenever you order in all your ‘stuff’…” There was a thudding sound followed by something rolling, “Fuck, I’m sorry dude, I’m not trying to lecture you or anything I just don’t want you to kill yourself, man. I know you don’t care but we all like, love you and shit. C’mon, tomorrow I’ll come by and – actually probably not tomorrow, Sig has me for Sunday – but Monday I’ll come by and we can get your joint all cleaned up. I could probably convince Dad to move you over to Bug’s old place if you need. If you still want to go along with our plan I ordered in a-”

“Bun… stop.” Doog spoke calmly yet with power, “There’s no point in it. There’s no reward for any of this… I’ve tried… I’ve tried to get out. Have you ever gone past those stop signs a few miles out? I did, and they were all waiting there. Big guns, black masks, and sunglasses. They shouted at me as they hopped off of their giant truck while blinding me with its lights. They told me to get down on the ground and pushed my face into the street while they shot their sedatives into my arm… I woke up back here with the pebbles and dirt still attached to my face. No matter what I do or what I could’ve done I’ll end up back here. How can you just play nice with them?  How can you come up to me and tell me that you want me to do the same?”

“I’m sorry, man. I just…” It became deafeningly quiet but in a different way than the facility was. 

Doog sighed, “I’m just… not ready to get cleaned up yet, Bun. Give me some time, I need to figure some stuff out first. I’m not really ready to rejoin the rest of the losers, I definitely can’t face Sig again just yet, especially after all this…” 

“I understand… we’ll still be here for you when you’re ready.”

It went quiet again, I tried to imagine what a crying Bun would look like. 

Then Doog spoke again, “One of your fans is listening in on us.” I had been found out somehow, maybe Doog’s bangs gave him super sight instead of blinding him.

“I know… it’s fine. Don’t act like you haven’t done the same in the past, remember that time at the special place? You were-”

“Fuck off Bunny.” Bun’s laughter tripped over his sniffling.

“C’mon Doog, I told you I’d never let you forget about it. Ah man, your face was so red when we saw you, holy hell.”

“Careful, or I’ll tell your little followers about the ‘incident’.”

“Haha oh man, I forgot all about the ‘incident’, I don’t think I’ve gone back there since.”

“That reminds me, give this stuff to the cub with the tired eyes.”

“Hmm? Dude, why do you have this?”

“It was left in the gazebo, it has his name on the inside. I just never found time to give it back and my place was closer.”

“That takes me back too, we used to play house there with the girls and the big kids would come and shit on us.”

“They used to call you little sis.”

“Yeah that’s right, that’s right. Man, kids nowadays take us for granted, we could’ve been so much worse.”

“Heh, reminds me of your first horror movie…” They kept nostalgia tripping and it was kinda awkward that they knew I was there so I snuck back out of the crack house. Manny was still sitting on the stairs by himself. 

“Hey Manny.”

He yawned, “Hi, is Doog okay?”

I nodded, “Bun and Doog are talking about boring stuff now and etcetera… I wish there were girls our age in town.”

“Yeah, girls would be nice.”

“Do you think Sig and Bun are together?”

“Hm? Oh uh yeah probably, I guess.” His ears were red under his hair, I think Manny had a weird babysitter-style crush on her or something. I didn’t get it: she smelled like Bun, she was mean to us, and her mom was weird, definitely not my type at least.

“Uh, nevermind. I overheard Doog talking about trying to leave town at some point. He said there were a bunch of gangsters patrolling the main road past some stop signs. I was kinda thinking though: what if you just kept going through the forest? I mean you’re bound to get out eventually, right?” I opened one of the now lukewarm milks and took a sip straight from the container.

“I don’t think we’d be able to survive the elements if we tried.” I passed the milk to him.

”Well yeah but I mean like if we could survive, there’s gotta be other towns out there somewhere.” 

“Maybe…” I could tell he wasn’t really in it right now, I’ll bug him about it some other time. I kept thinking about how Doog went to sleep in that house every night, that wretched place. Seeing something as shocking and sad as that must’ve affected Manny badly.

I didn’t connect the dots at the time but the caretakers had apparently given Doog’s parents’ privileges to him, the telephone on the table in his living room was the same kind that Mrs. Frisk was talking about and the promise of “anything you wanted within reason” seemed to extend to taboo items as well. After his parents died, he was essentially given unlimited access to the worst coping mechanism possible which he would realize in time. Some of the other parents were inspired by this creative use of liberty and decided to use it to their own satisfaction which would eventually trickle down to the rest of the town, supporting the casual drug economy among the young adults. If there was any proof that the caretakers didn’t actually care about our well being, it was Doog.

Bun shut the door behind him with a cigarette that smelled like Sig’s in his mouth and he was carrying, to my surprise, my missing winter gear. 

“Doog said you forgot this by the gazebo at the cemetery around Christmas time, hope it wasn’t too important. I guess clumsiness must, like, run in your family or something.”

I looked at Manny and he frowned back.

“Oh uh, Doog also said he wanted to talk to Finn by himself before we head out, don’t really know what his deal is with you. If he mentions anything about the ‘incident’ though you tell me, m’kay?”

“Uh, sure.” Back into the haunted house I went.

Doog was lying on a beanbag chair that was a gross shade of green. His hands were covering his face while the incline directed his body towards the ceiling. His room was kind of cool if messy: he had a desk with a pc setup, there were posters of poorly dressed women and metal bands although they were all stained and crinkled by smoke, and he had an elastic rope chair that looked like a spider’s web next to his bean bag. A dartboard was on his wall next to the desk but it looked like Doog had taken to just throwing the darts into the popcorned ceiling as there was a small pile of chalky fragments on the ground next to the darts. His room didn’t have blinds so he had just nailed a large blanket over his window to shield from the sun. 

“Bun said you wanted to tell me something?” I asked while scrunching my nose a bit.

He waited a moment before speaking, “Why’d you leave your clothes at the bunker?”

“So I could run away faster.”

“I see.” He cleared his throat, “Do you go there often?”

“No, not really.”

“Good… When I was your age, I used to.” He sat up in the bean bag, “I know that this might not make a lot of sense to you, especially coming from someone like me, but please listen to what I’m about to say with sincerity... Once it properly enters your mind, that place will relentlessly draw you to it. After my parents disappeared, I would spend days sitting with my back to that thing just listening. I’d press my ear against the cold doors and listen for their footsteps. I swear I could faintly hear them sometimes, just walking around but now I’m not too sure. Since you’ve been to it I’m sure you’ve felt it, that the world doesn’t feel right there, nature just doesn’t get that quiet on its own. Whatever that place is or whatever’s inside of it broke me. After a while I wasn’t going there out of grief for my parents but for something else, something… I can’t really describe with words, just calling it morbid curiosity doesn’t do it justice. When I didn’t go, the dreams would come and my psyche would rot and wither away until my ears returned to that metal. It took me all of this,” he gestured out with his hands as if to refer to the house, “to break free from it, and even then it’s still there in the peripherals of my memories. It stole my grief from me. When I try to think of my parents – their faces or their voices – I’m just back in that clearing again…” He was getting a bit choked up and roughly cleared his throat. “My point is that you can’t walk down this path that I have, you just can’t, no matter what. Whatever curiosity courses through your brain is artificial and pursuing it will destroy you. I haven’t been back there since the day I found your stuff but I know that if I focus hard enough I’ll hear it, still calling for me, endlessly. If that place has set its eye on you, you need to tell someone, even if it gets you in trouble. You need to get as far away from here as possible. Your Grandma is an important person, I’m sure if there’s any family in this town who could get out it’d be your’s. Do you understand?”

I nodded hastily.

“Good…”

“...So were you the person who snapped the twig behind me that day at the bunker?”

“What? No, that wasn’t me. If something made a sound in the presence of the bunker it was most likely a person though, that’s pretty unsettling. You were right to discard your gear in that case. I don’t know anyone, other than me, who would visit that place willingly.” Unsettling was definitely the right word. I went from disturbed that my gear was taken to disturbed that someone had been watching me that day, possibly for hours. Who though? And wouldn’t they tell someone about me? Shivers met me like an old friend I haven’t seen in a while.

“Why’d you lie to Bun about my stuff?”

“Bun always gets antsy when the bunker gets brought up, he pissed himself when he first encountered it at your age. If he knew you guys had been there he might tell your parents or something. Ah probably not but he’d get pretty uncomfortable, that’s all.”

“Thanks Doog.”

“Don’t mention it, thanks for getting Bun to come visit. It’s a horrible feeling to be forgotten, you know.”

I turned to leave, “Oh one more thing: can you turn the speaker on, on your way out?”

I turned the volume down before I hit resume to make sure I didn’t go deaf, that kind of silence would be way too much for me. Bun and Manny had worked their way through one of the gallons by the time I came out, which was kind of impressive. Bun tossed his cigarette butt into the jug and tossed that into the bucket. Bun wanted to get his money back for the other milk so we strolled towards the market together, dropping the bucket off when we would pass Grandma’s house. The onslaught of rain had finally ended.

“What were you guys talking about in there?”

“Oh, uh Doog wanted to know about someone named Ella, but I don’t know anything about her.” I lied.

“Ha! She’s gonna go crazy when I tell her Doog was asking about her.” I might’ve started something regrettable.

“Speaking of which, are you and Sig girlfriend and boyfriend?” Manny perked up when I asked.

“Ehh, sort of? She was my first kiss if that’s worth anything. If you’re curious I’m sure Doog can share ALLLLL the details on that.” He chuckled to himself, their nostalgia was rubbing off on me a bit. “Ah shoot I just remembered I left my stuff at her house, y’all can have the milk imma head back.”

“Bye, Bun!” We said, Manny took the milk back to his house and we called it a day there.

I thought back on what Doog had told me as I laid on my bed. I really wasn’t sure if he was going to be okay but Bun seemed to have hope. If I keep this obsession up I’ll probably end up walking down that same path eventually. I’m definitely not telling Mom about it though, she would kill me. Although Doog didn’t have the same opportunity I do now. I can actually access the interior of the fortress, surely whatever’s down there is worth the hell it’s been causing. I then thought of Manny and the idea of him having to live in Doog’s house after being traumatized by the bunker. I had forgotten all about his movies these last few weeks, I’ll have to ask him about them tomorrow. The more determined to go down that elevator I become, the more sure I am that I won’t find a happy ending down there. As of right then, I felt as though I was going to completely drop my pursuit of the bunker and in turn spend my time creating memories like Bun and Doog had done. I closed my eyes and for once, I had a dreamless sleep.

  


Chapter 3 Lower Mantle

I woke up in the Bunker. I was in one of the rooms of the first floor, curled up on the ground. My flashlight was there next to me, illuminating the wall of empty lockers. I immediately knew it wasn’t a dream, I exploded onto my feet and shot the flashlight all over the room to make sure I was alone. So, either I was carried here by someone and set into the facility or I sleepwalked into it myself. I didn’t know which would be worse. Mrs. Frisk said that the whole town had nightmares at some point which caused some people to sleep walk. I haven’t done so in the past but there’s a first time for everything. After making absolutely sure nothing was in here with me, I set out to find my way to the exit when something wet brushed up against my leg. I was still in my pajamas and the bottom of my pants were caked in mud. My shoes were on and I had tracked some mud into the room with them as well. So I guess I did sleepwalk here after all, great. 

The hallway lights were shining through the little window in the door and their hum returned to my ears when I opened it. I switched my flashlight off; everything looked exactly as I had left it. It was a bit weird that I had shut the door behind me in my sleep but it would probably have been more scary if it was left open. It didn’t take me long to find the room with the exit, as I could just follow my tracks, and when I got there I found out that it was still night time, worries of leaving the house door open and Mom finding my empty bed hit me and I went to climb the rope when the silence was broken by a noise. A nearby twig snapped outside. And then another, just to make sure the first had been heard. The shock sent through me was like someone had put an ice cube on my balls on the hottest day of the year. I struggled to descend the rope without making a sound then clumsily snuck back out into the hallway without taking my eyes off the hole.

That was definitely a person up there, Doog said so, and whoever was here at this hour was not a friend. I thought of places to hide but all the lockers were open, if I hid in one it’d be obvious and the reception room was a dead end. I hesitantly moved towards the elevator, when I first came here I didn’t expect it to work so maybe I’d be able to hide in it without having to go to level fifty. My shoes squeaked across the tile loudly and my hands became sweaty as I went. I pressed the button to open the doors but they stayed shut. Instead, the system sprung to life and the cabin started to return from wherever it had gone. The elevator had moved since my last time here. Maybe it rests at the lowest point when it’s not in use? Anything with a pinch of logic was enough for me to depend on it at this moment. I stood there with my back to the elevator doors waiting for it to ascend, staring out across the long hallway and focussing on the only door left open, waiting for whoever to step out. My ears begged for the sound of the cabin. I realized I hadn’t been breathing and my lungs activated, causing anxiety to increase as I wouldn't be able to listen for sounds from the room as easily over my breath. Some of the lights flickered and blinked, I felt like I was going to pass out. Then I heard it: the elevator cab was drawing close to me. My eyes watered and tears came down my cheeks out of stress then I heard another sound from down the hallway, a thudding sound. The facility's population was now at two. The wait was unbearable. My heart beat in my ears in anticipation for whoever would walk through the door. My legs became weak like a baby deer’s and when the doors finally opened, I fell backwards onto my bottom. I tried to get up but I fell again. I crawled to the buttons and reached up only to see that there were now several newly lit floor icons. I pressed a random one without paying much mind and the doors shut again, leaving me in the dark elevator whose lights were never fixed. 

My descent away from the intruder began and I started to calm down a bit. I turned my flashlight on just to make sure that the elevator was empty then shut it off. I wasn’t going to allow myself to run out of battery at an inconvenient time by any means. I turned to look at the buttons; I had pressed level thirteen, apparently. The smell of my old vomit in the trash can made my nose cringe and I tried not to think about it too much. Then the dizziness from the elevator combined with the panic earlier forced me to cake on another layer of waste. The elevator slowed to a stop and I braced myself for whatever thirteen would hold for me.

The light hurt my eyes when the doors opened. Thankfully this floor was more similar to the surface floor than fifty. A long room was filled with tall, black, intricate computer machines inside of glass lockers. Protruding wires and blinking lights caked the servers that decorated the space. It was chilly here but I was just thankful to be away from the smell as the doors shut behind me. But the elevator wasn’t finished, it whirred into action again as the cab had been called from a different floor. Panic wasn’t through with me yet and I ran to go find a hiding spot after discarding my traitorous muddy shoes. There were four rows of servers that ran though the room and at the end was a desk sitting on a rug with a few monitors facing the wall. Wires ran from the computers to tall metal lockers behind it, opening them revealed a cluster of important looking wires, switches, and the like. I was small enough that I could squeeze into the wire nest and shut the door without it looking too suspicious from the outside. It was either that or hide under the incredibly obvious desk. I sat there for a few minutes, the lights here didn’t buzz so it was just the sound of my breath echoing around the locker. The dinging sound of the elevator never came though, whoever that was had gone to a different floor, unless the population was higher than two and the elevator was called from below. I tried not to think about it.

I crawled out of the locker and went to grab my shoes, the tile was cold on my feet. I kicked off all the mud I could and wiped them on the rug to be safe. I couldn’t resist the urge to click my flashlight, my pajamas didn’t have pockets so I held the batteries I had ejected. While I was standing on the rug, the computer caught my attention. Five of the six monitors were covered in various error messages and the like, the rightmost one was off. I sat on the swivel chair so I could inspect them properly as my time in video editing had given me an interest in software. There was a mouse whose icon darted across the different monitors when I moved it, as well as a keyboard. There was also a weird scanner on the desk, kind of like the one for barcodes at the market. The leftmost screen had many black squares on a grey background with labels on them, each for a specific floor of the facility. A message read ""Surveillance cameras offline, contact relevant supervisor”. I tried to click the “x” icon on the message but the computer didn’t react, it was like it was frozen. The next monitor seemed to have statistics of the server’s health, it was a bit overwhelming to look at so I ignored it. The third from the left had an empty email inbox of some sort with a popup telling me that all of the selected files had been successfully deleted, clicking didn’t do anything there either. The fourth one had a files folder open, showing a collection of audio files. It reacted to my mouse and scrolling showed me that the folder was nearly endless. I clicked on one but a prompt appeared telling me that the file couldn’t be accessed without a proper clearance level. I didn’t really know what that meant, seeing the scanner made me think of clearance items from a store though so I probably had to scan something. The last online monitor had a home screen with a blue background filled with blank white icons with weird names as well as a message in the bottom left corner which read: “Alert! Two unreviewed transmissions, due: 4015 days ago”. I’m pretty sure that was older than I was, I clicked on the notification and to my surprise it actually opened a media player to play the “transmission”. The file read the date of 4015 days ago and it seemed to be a recording of a phone call between two people. A blaring alarm was going on in the background as it played.

“LARS WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING DOWN THERE?!” An adult with an angry, serious voice.

“I-I-I don’t know! Everything was fine then it all went dark, I can’t see any of the other rooms the cameras are just black. The security room and connectors are the only ones that’re fine so-” A stuttery squeaky voice filled with panic.

“What about the rest of the team?!”

“I-I can’t tell! They were just standing there and then… It’s… it’s so dark. I think the air lock might’ve been compromised? It wasn’t in operation and it’s still showing up as satisfactory on the review b-but they were having problems with it before. The hull could’ve been breached as well but scanners hadn’t picked up anything approaching, the construction might’ve been weak to begin with and that-”

“Is there anyone else there?”

“No sir, I’m the l-l-last one left, the rest have gone to…” He coughed violently.

“Listen I’m not done with you yet so get your shit together. You’re the only one left with the elevator clearance codes, I need you to relay them to me so that Arvid can lock the elevator’s position. We’re going to break up for a second, she’s turning the main power system offline. It'll take a second to- …backup power.”

“Carson… I realize now. Everything that Frey was saying was right, we should’ve left the second she told us to. They could’ve broken in at any time but they waited so that we would feel secure down here. I can see him on the camera, he’s standing in the connector. It’s like he can see me through the computer… he’s smiling, just like she said he would.” He whimpered.

“Lars, please tell me the elevator clearance code. The insurgents will rappel down the shaft to come get you when everything is back to normal I swear.”

Lars laughed, “Back to normal? Wake up Carson, it’s over. He’s going to come into my room and drag me into the dark with my wife and the rest of the silly Einherjar any second now… As for the clearance code, it’s the same as the depths elevator’s call code but backwards. Now you listen to me, ‘director’. We all knew damn well that we were building an… inverted tower of babel, and we went along with it anyway, knowing the outcome. But if you’re really so stupid that you think we’re going to rebuild after this ‘god’ strikes it down then you’ve got a rude awakening coming for you. Now please let me be, mine is opening my door right now.” There was a sound like a chair falling over and then it cut off.

The audio ended, I clicked the skip track button to go to the next one. 

“Be advised, all calls are being recorded.”

“Sir, this is Carson, facility director and acting leader of Station V1H11. Primary power is offline and the main elevator is locked to level fifty. I have lost contact with squad 01, their abyssal habitat is compromised in its entirety, and I am incapable of overriding the elevator to the depths so extraction is currently impossible. Backup power should last for the next thirty minutes. I am currently operating from level thirteen of the superstructure although there are agents on the twenty-second, thirty-eighth, thirty-ninth, and forty-second layers, as well as Arvid on the power level, the reserves in the armory, and the scientists in the dorms. Due to the power switching, I am unable to check security cameras to monitor the depths elevator. I'd advise a hasty extraction while it is still in the lowest position. I am unable to confirm whether or not it is in use but we should assume that it is, backup power should run out long before it reaches level fifty, however.” 

An old man spoke next, “Understood, UE’s have already been dispatched to the location (could have been youies, not sure). We’ll speak when I see you next.”

“Yes sir.”

The audio ended. I felt sick all of a sudden. I just, really wanted to get out of here and go back home and go to sleep in my bed. I did not have the capacity to put all of these pieces together yet. I got off the chair and walked to the elevator, pressing the button proved that the cabin had been moved from where I left it. I would have been worried that someone might’ve been waiting inside but I had become very tired all of a sudden and my mind didn’t grasp the risk. I was lucky and the elevator was empty again. I took the liberty of taking out the trash and threw the bin into the server room. Now that I had time, I checked the buttons to see what was available. Floors thirteen, nineteen, thirty, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty-eight, and the ground floor were lit up. Floor fifty was now unlit, thankfully that corpse was stuck down there now. The idea that floors could become dysfunctional and that I could at any time get stuck on a floor forever scared me but for some reason my mind just wasn’t grabbing it at the moment. I found it increasingly harder to focus on things and to think. A terrible headache took me as I pressed the ground floor button. It felt like my head was splitting in two, I curled up on the ground and held my temples as the elevator ascended. Trying to focus on anything punished me with sharp pain shooting through my skull; if there was anything left in my stomach it might’ve come up just now. It was like my senses were becoming paralyzed and distant from my comprehension. Then a thought entered my head. Only it wasn’t my thought, it was like something else was using my mind to think. I couldn’t tell you what it said but I remember that it haunted me in the coming weeks, it was like having a bad dream that you can’t recall but you’re still left with the feeling that you had a nightmare. My memories haven’t been the greatest lately so maybe it’ll come back to me at some point, more on that later. I don’t know how long I sat there curled up on the floor either. When I finally regained focus, the elevator had already reached the surface and the light from the hallway illuminated the cabin. I wasn’t back to normal but I just wanted to get out so I endured the headache and walked to the entrance.

After I climbed out I laid down on the grass and just stared at the clouded sky while my headache slowly faded out. The silence didn’t really bother me that much right now, if there was noise it would probably make my migraine worse. I noticed that I had lost my flashlight and its batteries but I didn’t really care. I just wanted to get home. My watch said it was one in the morning. It was dark and I didn’t have my torch but I was pretty confident I’d be able to find my way back. I tried to remember if I had left my flashlight at the desk in the server room or in the elevator but memories made my head hurt. After a good thirty minutes or so, I got up and walked back home through the woods. My pajamas and shoes were getting muddied again as I trekked down the wet path. The sounds of the forest entered my ears at some point and made me feel sick. I tried to throw up but it wouldn’t come. 

I eventually made it back; I had in fact remembered to close the door behind me, now I just need to find out if Mom woke up and checked on me or not. I took my shoes off outside and shook off what mud I could. I opened the door as slowly as possible so as to not make any noise, after slipping inside and finding myself in the clear I went up the stairs and back to my bed that I had unconsciously fled from earlier that night, changing into clean pajamas first of course. ",1,1758059353.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

I returned to the room I fell down into, closed the door, and sat in the desk’s chair while I waited to find out if I’d missed Manny or if he was still on his way. I sat there in silent shock as I recalled everything that just happened, what was that thing in floor fifty? Was that the body of someone who got stuck in here? Should I tell someone about it when I get out? The lights had turned on when I returned as well, did I cause that or did the facility naturally toggle its lighting system? I started to feel like I’d be okay with Manny telling the adults about everything just so that I could get removed from this horror as much as possible, even if it meant being grounded forever. As the light from the hole started to dim and the sky I could see got darker my hope dwindled, but this time I was lucky, or unlucky. The sound of quick footsteps made its way to my ears and the out-of-breath panting of Manny.

“Finn…! Are you… There?” he wheezed.

 “M-Manny! Did you tell the adults?”

“No no, of course not. I got the rope, let me just… catch my breath.”

“Can you tie it to a tree and throw it down?”

“Yeah… yeah just gimme a second. Are you still okay down there?” I hesitated a bit, if I was going to tell him everything now probably wasn’t the best time.

“I’m alright.”

I waited for his panting to quiet and then for him to tie the rope to a nearby tree. It was the perfect length and the tip just barely scraped the tile. I tossed the flashlights up and climbed my way out with some help from my friend and just like that I was back to the surface. I laid down and just looked at the sky for a bit, it was so bright up here. The wind had never felt so good on my face. Manny also sat down next to me, relieved to have evaded a tragedy. There was something uncomfortable underneath me though, I sat up after a while and found the missing knife staring back at me, mockingly. I showed Manny but I think we were both beyond finding it amusing at this point. 

I stood up and walked to the doors just to see it for myself. They were indeed sealed shut and my gear had in fact disappeared. I still wasn’t ready to think about it though so I started to walk back to the trail, I didn’t realize I had been clicking the whole time until the sound of the forest interrupted it. 

“Wait Finn!”

“What?”

“Well? Did you see it?”

“W-w-what are you talking about?”

“The music box of course! It was so loud I could hear it from the forest, wasn’t it down there with you?”

“...No there wasn’t a music box, I didn’t hear anything like that down there it was just… silence. It was so quiet Manny, I don’t… I don’t know what that place is but we weren’t meant to find it.” I didn’t tell him about the corpse or the elevator or any of my expedition. After what he told me on the main road I felt like it would be a bad idea to tell him more secrets that were being held by the adults. I’m sure now, with the way Bun reacted to it, the words scratched on the wall of level fifty, and Mom’s warnings, that most of the people in our town knew about this place and maybe its purpose. I thought of Mrs. Frisk’s warning that certain events would happen again, she was probably a good place to start if I wanted to figure anything out about the place.

We left the rope dangling into the hole, I don’t think anyone would care that the cemetery's ugly swing had been grave robbed. I didn’t end up confessing to Mom about any of it either, I was still in a bit of shock when I got back and I figured that it’d be best if I didn’t jump the gun on anything. I didn’t even use the night light, I just left my room’s overhead light on while I slept. I caught myself subconsciously snapping my fingers a few times in a way similar to my clicking of the flashlight. My regularly scheduled Dawn of the Dead nightmares were interrupted by dreams of that place. They didn’t even feel like dreams, they were more like visions. I could feel the cold of that room, smell the sulfuric scent, and of course feel the fear that I had felt. I’d wake up in the middle of the night a few times to find that my mom had turned the light off, I would just sit there in terror, not daring to check my room for fear of what I might see until morning came or I drifted back to sleep. Despite all this, my curiosity didn’t waver at all. I still wanted to see what was down that second elevator or what the other floors contained, it felt like the facility was calling me back to it in a supernatural way. 

I became a bit distant from Manny after the incident, I was more closed off and less conversational. I would direct my focus more into the schoolwork just to distract myself from my thoughts. I caught myself zoning out a couple times during class and finding myself clicking a pen repeatedly, the experience had apparently blessed me with a bad habit. I was planning on questioning Mrs. Frisk about some things about town and the complex but I hadn’t worked up the courage yet. 

Spring brought about a lot of rain and because of it we had to spend our recesses inside where we’d play old board games and stuff. Some of the big kids would just go home for the day instead though, so you’d often get stuck playing Monopoly with some snot nosed brats. There was about an eighteen day span during that spring where it rained every single day and our class dwindled down to around half its size. Me and Manny had started to become accustomed to playing Uno during each of our recesses while the younger kids would play with the building blocks, we were the oldest kids there so we were kind of expected to take care of them while Mrs. Frisk took her break. When there were a lot of call ins, our teacher would take increasingly longer breaks which meant we would get a longer recess, which was great; there wasn’t a lot of sense in progressing the unit too much if half the class would miss it anyways. I had been working up to ask Mrs. Frisk about some things and this seemed like a good time to do so, yesterday’s recess lasted almost an hour and a half so today’s would probably be longer. I ended up telling Manny about my interrogation plans and he wanted to join me, which I didn’t really see a problem with, we both just wanted to know more about the town. 

Mrs. Frisk took her breaks in the main classroom most of the time but if she wanted a smoke she would open a window in the storage room. She had a thermos of tomato soup and a cold grilled cheese on a napkin on one of the unused desks as well as her weird flask, her fingers were holding a cigarette over the window sill. She was just peacefully enjoying her lunch while listening to the rain, much different than the last encounter I’d had with her in this room. 

“Mrs. Frisk?”

She flicked her cigarette out the window and hid her flask in the desk again, “Yes? What’s going on boys?”

“Um… we just wanted to ask you about our town a bit, if that’s okay.” I said.

Mrs. Frisk frowned, “Did your mother put you up to this?”

“Wh-no! Of course not, I just want to know about our history is all.” I suppose it looked a bit suspicious coming back after what happened last time, but I had Manny with me now.

“Mrs. Frisk you’ve already taught us about the early days of our town last winter and you always tell us that ‘Curiosity is our superpower’. I think it's a bit silly for you to spark our curiosity and then snuff it out.” I guess he was pretty serious about getting some answers, too.

“You boys know that the parents don’t want me teaching our history anymore. I could get into serious trouble if I did.”

“Not my parents ma’am, Mom and Dad don’t know anything about this place and no one’s willing to give us any answers. Plus, this doesn’t even really count as teaching, you’re on break and we’re not in the classroom.” I was very glad I decided to take Manny with me.

She sighed, I couldn’t tell if it was because she was annoyed or relieved, “...I suppose some of the basics wouldn’t hurt too much. I’m also in the same boat as your parents, Manny, I don’t really know enough about what’s actually been going on here.” She brought her flask out of the desk and took a big swig of whatever was inside, “Grab a chair, this’ll take a while.”

We removed a couple of chairs from their intimidating tower by the blackboard and sat them down in front of our teacher. “Another thing before I start my ramblings: don’t talk about any of this outside of this room. If someone finds out I told you some of these things, well, I don’t know what’ll happen but I don’t want to find out. And if you do want to discuss this with each other, do it far away from town, there’s always gonna be someone who’ll hear what you say while you’re in town, even if you think you’re alone.”

We looked at each other and nodded. She took another swig, “Okay I’m going to have to start with my late husband, Ulrich. We dated through high school and got married a couple of years after our graduation. We lived together when he went to college for biology and I took day jobs to support ourselves. Twelve or so years flew by and Ulrich had become a successful ecologist with a promising career when some government agent type people came into contact with him.

“I don’t understand the specifics of what they wanted him for but to Ulrich it seemed like a huge opportunity, which was all that mattered to me at the time. The only caveat was that what they were offering required us to completely dedicate ourselves to it, yes the both of us. We had to move to a discreet new location, cut contact with all of our family members, take new names, and live there for the rest of our lives. In return we would, essentially, get anything we wanted for the rest of our days so long as our requests were within reason. We’d never have to worry about food or money or rent, which were problems we had been battling up until that point.” I wasn’t really prepared for a Mrs. Frisk lore dump and wasn’t paying the most attention. Manny was very focussed though and he recapped some of these details to me afterwards. It was weird hearing about people’s lives outside of town, it had always been a bit of a fantasy in my head. 

“We, of course, took the deal and were sent out to this place in the middle of nowhere. The actual work they needed my husband for wasn’t needed for the next two years, to my understanding, but he had to attend some sort of classes to debrief, or to prepare him for his work. I tried to ask him about the classes but he told me that he wasn’t allowed to talk about anything he had learned with me. We were some of the first inhabitants in our town, other than the Tofts, of course. There were a few rules we had to follow, none were too interesting. Just basic guidelines but they were unusually serious about one of them: we weren’t allowed to go anywhere near this great chasm in the woods.” She paused to take a sip from her flask and a bite of her sandwich, “I didn’t realize this at the time but the cave was where Ulrich’s job was to eventually take place. Two years passed by and he was sent out with a team of other ecologists and military men to survey the land and to prepare for their project. 

“Other scientists of different flavors moved to the neighborhood and brought with them their families as time went on. I was eventually put in charge of their kids as I simply had nothing to do while my husband was working and I needed to occupy myself. Jobs weren’t mandatory in our weird little science outpost and most would just spend their time in an early retirement enjoying their hobbies. Things were going well in life until they were ready to begin the construction.

“It took them five years to construct it, whatever it was. We weren’t allowed to go near it under any circumstances. The uninitiated, or the people who weren’t a part of the group, believed it was some kind of lab complex for our workers but we were never given an official explanation as to what its true purpose was. They dug straight down into that great cave to build their fort while our town became a storage place for all their equipment. It was absurd how we had to deal with all of the commotion every day and weren’t even allowed to-” Mrs. Frisk paused to take a deep breath and calmed herself, “It was about six months from completion when the nightmares began. Every person in town began having horrific nightmares, or night terrors is probably more accurate, as we would wake up screaming and thrashing about each night. Everyone was expected to take psychological evaluations twice a week and to administer their prescribed medicine, I doubt anyone actually benefited from their meds but we took them nonetheless. As time progressed the hysteria worsened: people would wake up having wandered deep into the woods in their sleep, they would find themselves missing entire days in their memory, and some would describe experiencing sleep paralysis encounters that felt like they had lasted days. The sight of my poor students wearing those unnaturally tired eyes just makes me…” She shuddered. 

“A few people, including myself, were sent out of town for a while but the symptoms continued, no medical analysis or mental evaluation produced anything conclusive or helpful. Then one day, it stopped.

“Everything went back to normal and the people in charge of our group never gave us a good explanation for it, I’m positive that they knew what was causing it. The construction finished a couple months later and Ulrich's shifts in that dungeon started. He would disappear for days at a time and return randomly to see me. I didn’t understand any of it and it was driving me crazy but, my Ulrich was happy, which was enough to satiate me. He was a part of an important team of scientists, including your parents and grandma,” She pointed at me, I knew my dad and grandma were scientists but I didn’t know my mom had anything to do with it, let alone in cooperation with the others. 

“There were other workers who commuted from outside of town to go work in the lab but the people who lived here were of a higher importance. Their unit called themselves the Einherjar, although they seemed to treat it more like satire, always giggling about it and whatnot. Scandinavian mythology seemed to be some sort of theme with their work as the names we were given were also norse, the way they talked about it made it seem like it was just a dark inside joke of some sort… Then…” She knocked back the flask dramatically and took a big gulp of the mystery adult liquid. “Anyways, all that matters is that eventually, the project was suspended and the government or whoever pulled their resources out of our now inactive station. We still receive our promised benefits but less frequently and we still weren’t allowed to break our ‘contracts’ so we were trapped here. We were left in anticipation for our extermination but it never came, our caretakers decided to keep us around and encouraged us to grow this little station, even though its location was so inconvenient. Despite everything that happened… they still had plans to go back down there at some point. Their filthy pride wouldn’t let them give up, a story as old as time yet they didn’t care. I’m sure any day now they’ll bring even more starry eyed professionals into town just to-” She caught herself. “I think that’s just about enough for today, I’ve been spoiling those kids with these long recesses.” 

Manny wasn’t satisfied though, “So why can’t we have phones?”

Mrs. Frisk sat back down, “The stipulations, or the rules, of our deal prevented us from communicating outside of town so things like email addresses, phone numbers, and the like are prohibited. If they find any telephones outside of the ones they’ve given us, they’d be confiscated. The other technologies we are granted for entertainment such as computers and televisions are restricted from sending and receiving messages.”

I chimed in, “The telephones they’ve given you?”

“Yes, in order to contact our caretakers we were given our own specialized phones. Mine is at home right now, I haven’t used it in years.”

“Why can’t we have locks on our doors?”

“Their official statement was that bears were common around the area and that locks were forbidden for safety. Ulrich told me that that wasn’t the case, however. During their surveys they found no traces of any bear life, or most other regular wildlife, which was somewhat unusual. I’m sure it was just done to intimidate us, make us obey them or else, you know? That’s how they’ve been operating for the most part.” So Manny was right about the bears. If everything Mrs. Frisk said was true, the government people must’ve had to admit to his parents that there weren’t actually any bears, Mom must’ve also known since she let us go into the forest by ourselves.

“Why were my parents asked to move here if the project was suspended?”

“The medical team that was currently in charge of our health were retired from their services, the unit in charge of our care found it more convenient to admit another family and your parents were competent enough for the position. They are also expected to take apprentices at some point to my understanding.” I remembered a couple of doctors visiting our house when I was three, Mom told me they came from out of town to help. We still had a dentist in town though, I suppose they’re in a similar situation as Manny’s parents. I wanted to ask her about why the graveyard was empty but I didn’t want to be insensitive. I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was purposely withholding something very important. I just kept picturing that facility I had stood in being flooded with important looking people in lab coats, it made its current state all the more unnerving.

“Mrs. Frisk, Bun mentioned that we were supposed to have a “talk” when we were old enough but that Ella was the last person to get it.” I asked.

“Yes, we told the children a summarized version of this story when they had reached a certain age, without my input of course. Some became increasingly paranoid about their parents’ jobs or the rules of the town so we worked to ease their minds. But now, well, I’ve already shared my thoughts on how I feel about the parents’ decision with you.” She appeared as though she was done talking about things, it seemed that talking about her past was taxing. “I’ll take one more question, then we have to actually get back to class.” She went to take another sip but it was empty, she drank her tomato soup instead. Manny and I looked at each other. I wasn’t sure what else to ask about, I was almost tempted to just ask what she had been drinking from her flask. Manny on the other hand had a lot of questions he wanted to voice, he redeemed our last question, “What does Mr. Toft do?” 

“I’m… not really sure. I don’t know a lot about his background but he seemed to play a big part in things during the construction and project days even though he wasn’t one of the scientists. My best guess is that he’s a representative of our “employers” who keeps tabs on everyone, he’s pretty active in the community after all.” Bun’s dad was a serious man, he was as opposite to his son as possible. Whenever I saw him he was dressed nice, his posture was perfect, and he talked like a business man. His blond mustache was perfectly symmetrical as was his baldness which left hair only on the sides and back of his head. He was the kind of guy to call you “sport”, although when acknowledging that he might have been involved with the compound his friendly demeanor seemed entirely superficial.

“Alright boys, it’s time to get back to class. Let’s go get the-” She stood up but had to support herself on the desk, I guess whatever she was drinking made her a bit too sleepy, “Whoofta! On second thought let’s just call it a day. Go tell the munchkins that they can go home early… and remember: none of this leaves the room.” 

The “munchkins” had turned their too-long recess into a nap time, we woke them and told them the good news. It was still coming down hard outside but we decided to endure it rather than wait for it to stop. Instead of going straight home we took a detour to the cemetery so that we could discuss what we’d heard. There was a gazebo in the resting grounds by the trees which was where we took refuge from the rain, we figured it was far away enough from town that no one would be able to eavesdrop. 

We sat there for a bit just listening to rain, I bet Manny was thinking about how he could film the scene. The tire from the incomplete swing sat on the ground a little ways away from us, the rain making its black rubber shine. The wooden park bench we were sitting at in the gazebo had profanities and dicks scratched into its surface which I traced with my fingernail while Manny stared out at the tombstones. 

“...Mrs. Frisk told you that the gravestones had names no one would recognize, right?”

“Mmhm.”

“I suppose those must be their original names, then…”

He went to clean his glasses, taking his raincoat off so that he could use his dry under shirt to wipe his breath off the lenses. I thought about which plot was supposed to be Ulrich’s, there were about twenty-five to choose from. They must've used their real names to help cover up whatever had happened to them all. I started to chew on my raincoat’s zipper while I dragged my fingernail across the wood.

“Mrs. Frisk said that there weren’t any bodies though, so maybe Ulrich's still alive?”

“Hmm, she also referred to him as her late husband.” 

“Where did all their bodies go then?”

“...”

We both had a bad feeling that we knew where they were. No matter what question you started with, it always led back to that place. As time went on it seemed as though Manny’s refusal of the bunker was starting to wane, some part of me wanted to do everything in my power to make sure he never went where I did. At the same time, I felt like it was calling me back. It was so terrible yet for some inexplicable reason I needed to go back, it was like I had forgotten something important there that I had yet to remember. Another part of me wanted to coerce him to go, to show him what I saw and to go down that second elevator to “Valhalla” with me. I remembered the marionette.

“Has your mom told you about working with the scientists ever?”

“Nope and I don’t know how I could ask her without Mrs. Frisk getting found out. She’d probably ground me if I mentioned it at all anyways.”

“Mmmm, what about your grandma?”

“I… guess I could ask her. If Mom finds out she’ll put me and Grandma in a home, though. I think that’s like how adults ground each other, I’m not sure.”

He put his rain coat back on, “Finn, if the government is evil and is hurting people we might have to get involved and go down into the bunker. I don’t want to but the fate of the world could rest on this.” He was so cool. He then sneezed and a long string of snot got stuck to his sleeve awkwardly. 

“Oh Manny, that reminds me: how did you get the rope down by yourself?”

“Hm? Oh yeah! Do you know Doog? He was visiting the cemetery and he saw me struggling so he gave me a hand.”

“W- did you tell him what you were using it for?!”

“No, he didn’t even ask. Doog’s cool like that.”

Doog was a few years Bun’s senior but they were good friends even if they were quite different. Doog had long black hair with bangs that covered his eyes, he wore sleeveless metal band shirts with ripped jeans all the time, and his voice was unnaturally deep because of some condition he had. I don’t know if his real name was Doug or if his nickname came from being called “dog” all the time or what the reason was. Doog was an only child and both his parents seemed to have been involved in the “bunker incident” so he lived alone. He dropped out of school at some point and just spends his time at home so we barely ever see him; he only ever goes out when he has hangouts with Bun or apparently when he goes to grieve. 

“Do you think Doog knows anything about the bunker?” I asked.

“What? Why would he?”

“Well, I mean he doesn’t have any parents anymore, they must’ve had to tell him what actually happened to them.”

“How are we supposed to ask him about that without being mean? Doog’s cool, I don't wanna be mean to him.”

“We can ask Bun to help, maybe?”

“I don’t wanna run any more weird errands. Plus I don’t know if we can really trust Bun, his dad was that government guy.”

“If Bun was on his side I don’t think he’d have us do whatever we did for him. I’m pretty sure he hates his dad, too. Anyways, I’m gonna go figure out Grandma’s secrets, you should be in charge of Doog’s.”

“...Fine.”

The rain still hadn’t stopped and it wasn’t planning to. I thought about how the rain must look coming through the hole in the ceiling back at the facility, there must be a big puddle traveling through the cracks of the tiles. Thinking about it now makes my head hurt as I type this. I have memories of hearing the precipitation overhead while sitting in that compound even though I was never there while it rained, yet it’s so vivid and perfect in my mind. Anyways, we went home to go play Mario Kart and Manny's mom made us turkey sandwiches; I remember her being suspicious of all the early release days we were having at school.

I resolved to go visit Grandma by myself at the end of the week but when I finally showed up and knocked on her door there was no reply. I went in and looked around in case Grandma had had an accident or something but strangely enough she wasn’t there. I saw all of her calligraphy work on her desk in her study and got distracted by some other papers under it. My spy game had picked up right where I had left it although none of my espionage yielded anything valuable. A lot of the papers were covered in black highlighter or contained too many acronyms and jargon to be understandable. There were a couple of pictures though, one of a large building with many windows and a flagpole outside and the other was a black and white portrait of a young woman, her eyes were censored and the nametag she was wearing was illegible. She had pale skin, a brown haired bob cut, and was wearing a black suit. I flipped the portrait over and on the back was written “0V 01 0H 11 00 00 Potential Candidate - Desk 03/08/1970”. I didn't know what that meant but the censored eyes made it look like it was important. I copied the description down onto a nearby note card just in case it came in handy later.

Other than the desk, Grandma’s study was full of multiple overflowing filing cabinets and boxes on top of them filled with video film. There was one of those plastic office rug things so that an office chair could move around easier over the carpet. A corkboard was being used as a dartboard next to the door, a calendar on it had a dart sticking into the third and seventh of December, 2001, as well as many post it notes with unreadable memorandums upon them. I’d assume that this room was offline if the calligraphy didn’t contradict that, what else was she using this place for? Maybe there was a secret door somewhere. 

I resisted the urge to search for one when I remembered how weird it was that Grandma, the shut-in, wasn’t home. I checked the basement but she wasn’t there either, her lab was in the same state as it was on Christmas Eve. I decided to leave and to ponder a way to ask Mom about her disappearance without raising suspicions about why I was visiting Grandma by myself; I figured a school project about the elderly would be an innocent enough excuse. I stepped down the stairs from her old house back into the rain, making sure I turned all the lights back off and closed the door behind me. At least all of her flowers were being properly watered.

I went back home and hid the notecard away under my bed then went to talk to Mom but she also wasn’t home. Maybe they were having a night out or something? I think Manny was trying his luck with Doog so I had nothing to do while I waited for her to get back. I decided to head back out to go get some food from our sandwich shop, being by myself at home made me uncomfortable and even more so after my bad adventure into the depths. Being home alone always made me feel like I was somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be, even though it was my home. Sounds like the house settling put me on edge and I would end up grabbing my flashlight to entertain my bad habit. 

The sandwich shop was one of four restaurants in the town, there was also a burger place, a diner with abnormally good pancakes, and a dine in restaurant. Other than the sandwich place and the diner, the restaurants were poorly managed as the demand wasn’t enough to justify having good workers around the clock. The dine in restaurant was only ever open on the weekends from noon to night and the burger place was actually open every day although the workers were never sober and the food sucked, not to mention various food code violations happening on the regular. The diner and sandwich place were good because some of the parents got together to oversee the stores, instead of some depressed teenagers who were forced to get jobs. The Hansens, who used to have a couple of older twins in my class, took charge of the diner once their children “graduated” and turned the place into a very viable breakfast option. The sandwich shop was more of a delicatessen but everyone just called it “The Sandwich Shop”, it was run by a rotating group of adults including: Mr. Toft, Mr. Christensen, both of the Larsens (our across the street neighbors), Mrs. Karlsen, and a few others I can’t remember. I’m pretty sure Bun spent a month or two working there at some point which is probably when he obtained his legendary sandwich crafting abilities.

The shop was across the town, next to the cinema and other stores. As I was walking through the dim, windy, rain soaked town I noticed papers were floating in puddles by the street, getting sucked down into the sewers. I grabbed one before it could escape and on it was a picture of Meowbles with the word “MISSING” at the top, along with the details of her owners on the bottom, even though everyone was well acquainted with the locally famous Christensen cat. The family must’ve been trying to put the posters up during the downpour when they blew away into the street. As time went on, I remembered seeing more of them plastered on street lamps, telephone poles and even our blackboard at school. 

That persistent paranoia had found its way back to me, I hadn’t seen another soul since I left school a few hours ago and now Meowbles was missing. I ran the rest of the way, cutting through a couple muddy lawns and puddle spotted streets. I reached the block with all the stores and practically flew through the door to the sandwich shop, slipping on the tile and using the door to keep from falling. The bell rang when I went in but there wasn’t anyone in sight to notify of my arrival. I put my coat on a hook by the door and shook my fingers through my hair to get all the wet off. 

The yellowish lights were buzzing overhead as I approached the counter, flanked on both sides by glass containers of sandwich meat and bread. My boots squeaked when I went up to ring the service bell. It took a while but the backdoor creaked open and the sounds of outside slipped in for just a moment. The tall, serious Mr. Toft was on the clock today. He threw his apron back on and wiped his hands on it before greeting me, he spoke hastily, “Hiya sport! Just gimme a second to dry off real quick. Whatta day for weather, huh? …Now, what can I get going for ya?” He smelled like cigarettes and cologne.

“Um, can I get a PB & J?”

“Hm? Why certainly, son. A bit strange to come all the way out here just for a PB & J though, don’tcha think? Bah! Who am I to judge? I ate nothing but when I was your size, classics are good for character, that’s what I say.” I thought about how Mrs. Frisk described him as someone who kept tabs on people, he might know where Grandma was.

“Mr. Toft? Do you know where my mom and grandma are?” I asked as he whipped together a master class sandwich.

“Oh yes, oh yes, I do know EXACTLY where they are, son. Your momma didn’t mention anything to you before they left? That clumsy old woman, always forgetting somethin’ important… Nevermind that aside sport, we all got our flaws don’t we? Anywho, your poor granny twisted her ankle tendin’ to her daisies, or something of the nature, and was rushed off to go get some proper care from outta town this morning. Taxi should be dropping them back off momentarily.” I guess he really did keep tabs on everyone, or maybe this was just a special case. 

“Alrighty, we’re ready and good to go here. That’ll run ya one bill and two of your luckiest twenty-five cent coins, bud.” It might’ve been the most perfect PB & J I ever laid eyes on, he had added crunchy peanut crumbs on top of the peanut butter and melted marshmallows on top of those while combining multiple different flavored jelly spreads and then proceeded to toast the bread with a blow torch, the skill must run in the family somehow. I checked my pockets but there was no resounding clinking of quarters, “Ah… I forgot my allowance at home, I’ll be right back.”

“Nope. Hold it right there son, in that case this one here’s on the house. You’re a good kid Finley, no reason to make ya hurt for it too much, ‘specially when this weather's been taking souls, ya know? Don’t wanna have to see your mother putting up posters next to no scrappy third-rate cat, that’s for sure. Just remember that all of us here townspeople are on the same side, no reason we can’t just help one another.”

“Thank you Mr. Toft!” He winked as he wrapped the meal up and then I was put back out into the weather. I looked back through the glass door to see Bun’s dad discard his apron and exit the way he came. Everything was essentially free in the town because of the way things worked, so his generosity wasn’t really worth much but it was still pleasant. It felt different than when Bun had done it at least. Anyways, I wasn’t sure if his explanation for the missing parents was correct but I didn’t really have much else to go with. I made my way back home to enjoy the sandwich even though the wind was trying its hardest to take it from me.

When I made it inside the rainstorm was evolving into a thunderstorm, I always liked the sound of roaring thunder. I was ready to enjoy the meal in my cozy home when an anxious feeling entered my mind. It felt like something was wrong but I had no idea what. It was like when you leave for work and are forgetting something important at home but can’t put your finger on what it is. I racked my brain for anything causing the feeling but came up empty. Did I leave Grandma’s door open? No, I definitely shut it all the way. My raincoat and boots were by the door so I didn’t forget those and it was Friday so my backpack was still at school. It was starting to get very dark in the house so I ran around and turned all the lights on downstairs just to feel less vulnerable. I took my PB & J into the TV room so I could sit on the lazy boy in the corner and have my back to the walls. I wanted to go get my flashlight but it was upstairs, visions of bad guys waiting in the dark at the top of the staircase plagued my young mind so I stayed where I was. I started to scratch the leather couch rhythmically. The house started to creak from the wind but it sounded like someone heavy footed was walking around the second floor, trying to be sneaky. “If something took Meowbles in there it’ll probably try to take you as well…” Mom’s words found their way back to me, that human-monster was coming back for me and it was walking around upstairs. The marionette snuck into the house while I was gone and was waiting for its chance to strike. If I went for the door right now it would jump out at me from around the corner. My only way out would be if Mom were to come through that door and save me.

“No, he wouldn’t let himself be heard.” A familiar voice spoke, I spun my head around trying to find them. The voice was too close to me, I hesitantly looked up to the ceiling but there was no cliche jumpscare in store for me yet. It took me a moment to realize that it was me who had said it, but at the same time, I didn’t. Something else said those words with my mouth, I would never have referred to that thing as a “he”, that was something else’s logic. I didn’t understand what exactly had made me say that but I knew that it hadn’t done it to help me, it was done out of respect for that horrific corpse; it wouldn’t allow me to improperly perceive it. I felt safer in my home for the moment knowing it wasn’t present but more terrified in the grand scheme of things. I felt a despairful, sinking feeling that whatever curse I had incurred upon myself by going to level fifty was permanent and it wouldn’t let itself be easily forgotten. My perfect sandwich tasted bland when I finally got to eat it.

Mom didn’t come home until about 4:30 A.M., I knew because I didn’t get to sleep that night. I went down to talk to her, she was putting a pot of coffee on. Her long brown hair was a bit unkempt and messy, when she turned around to see me I saw that she had tired eyes to match.

“...Oh, hi hun. Couldn’t get any sleep?”

I shook my head.

“You really shouldn’t do so much TV before bed anymore, it’s ruining your sleep. I forgot to tell you but Grandma and I had to go out of town for some errands earlier today… or yesterday, I mean.” She yawned.

“Mmhm, Mr. Toft told me. Is she alright?”

“Yup she’s doing fine, I’ll have to go and get her when she’s released in a week. Her health just hasn’t been improving these last ten years, she might have to move into the… You said Mr. Toft came by?” Her mind was vulnerable from sleep, now might be a good time to strike.

“No, I went to the sandwich shop and he was working. He gave me a free PB & J.”

“...I see.” 

“Can I go see Grandma? I have to do a school project on old people and it’s due on Monday.” I repurposed my lie I concocted earlier.

“No hun. Grandma’s in no condition to have visitors right now. I’ll write a note for school.” Regular Mom probably would have immediately seen through that lie.

“What’s in the bunker?” 

“Not now, Finn.” I guess she wasn’t too vulnerable. She poured herself a coffee, “You want one? Or are you going back to sleep?” It tasted bad, but I wanted to feel mature so I kept forcing it down the hatch.

“Mom, do you hate Grandma?”

“What?! I don’t hate your Grandma Finn. We just don’t agree on some things, that's all. Your Grandma has a lot of regrets with her work and it’s hard for her to cope with it at times which makes her irritable and spontaneous…” She sipped her coffee. “Don’t worry about it sweetpea, you’re not still worried about that notebook she tried to give you, are you?” She was moving onto the offensive, the stupid coffee must be to blame.

“No it’s just that me and Manny were wondering… nevermind.”

“How’s your guys’ project going?”

“O-our project?” 

“Hm? The movie you were making?”

“Oh yeah, I forgot. The, uh, rain has been making production hard for us.”

“Is that so?” When Mom breaks out the “Is that so?”’s, bad things usually follow. I fled the scene before anything incriminating was extracted from me. ",1,1758059297.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

1niuuye,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1niuuye/if_your_breakup_is_fresh_go_easy_on_yourself/,"If your breakup is fresh, go easy on yourself.","hey, if you’re fresh out of a breakup i just wanna say something real quick.

at first it doesn’t even feel real. you still kinda have hope, so you keep living your life, seeing friends, doing hobbies, but deep down you’re waiting. then one day it hits, they’ve detached, it’s really over. and that crash is brutal. it’s like a little death. you look at them acting like strangers and you think, how can this even be the same person i loved? it’s one of the worst feelings.

in that stage you might beg, you might reach out, you might have dark thoughts. mornings feel empty without their text, nights are hard because they’re in your dreams. i know it’s rough.

here’s the part people don’t always say out loud: you do not have to throw yourself into hobbies or force yourself to be social if that’s not what you need. a lot of people will tell you to go out, keep busy, meet people, pick up new hobbies. for some that helps. for others it feels like pretending you’re fine when you’re not. we are not all the same. if the breakup is fresh, you don’t need to keep up with everything. you don’t need to be productive, you don’t need to “work on yourself” right away. let it be painful. you are allowed to not be a great friend or coworker for a while.

this stage can feel like being sick and needing to recover. so treat yourself gently, like someone who’s healing. if that means lying in bed watching anime all day, do it. if it means ordering chinese and spending money on coffee, do it. if it means isolating for a while, tell your family and friends you need space and that you’ll reach out when you’re ready. don’t force yourself to go out or fake fun. don’t force hobbies. you are allowed to be small and slow and messy.

it will get better. day by day you’ll notice tiny shifts. maybe you’ll order takeout less, maybe you’ll cook once, maybe you’ll take a short walk instead of staying in bed. healing isn’t a project, it’s a slow drift. surviving this is enough for now.

i felt like a sick person recovering and now i’m feeling quite good. it’s possible. one breath at a time. ❤️",5,1758059251.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

2. Wanted to binge watch Steven Universe. I offered to watch it with him and he said no, so I said ""Okee.""

About 7 hours after that I asked if I had done something to upset him in particular and that was why he didn't want me to stop by (this is a very common thing I've done many times, he'd also sometimes request me being him a coffee/snack/whatever so this was unusual for him to say no). He crashed out at me and compared me to his former r*pist and abusive girlfriend (name censored in the post).

Do I owe her more time and energy?,"I’ve had a friend for 10 years (both 40’s F) who I’m finally realising is toxic. The last decade has been hard- trauma, chronic health issues, solo parenting, financial strain- so I never fully processed how draining she was. I always thought she texted and messaged too much. I found it a bit self-centred that she reported her day to me (I’m getting coffee, I’m eating a sandwich for lunch, I’ve had 7 phone calls at work, I’ve gotta go to the grocery store, etc.) But she built up the frequency with time and there were so many things that demanded my immediate attention that I never pulled the fleeting thoughts about her annoyances to the forefront of my mind. And I wondered if I wasn’t being fair. I’ve had an unusually hard life and I never want to be that friend who has no time for people just cuz I’m going through something difficult. Plus, I’m sure I’m annoying at times, too. So, I tried to be supportive and respond to things as much as I could. But the more time went on and the more vulnerable I became as traumatic events and health issues unfolded, the more she flooded me with minutia. 

Attempts to set boundaries or shift the dynamic went nowhere. If confronted, she’d play the victim. When my life got especially heavy this year- declining health, a death in the family, a cancer scare- she listened less and talked more. Her “support” was canned (“I’m sorry, that sucks”) while she cycled through the same repetitive complaints and fantasies, like insisting we wanted live together despite me saying no many times. Every time she brings it up again, it’s like I’ve never said no before. It sometimes feels like talking to an NPC. I also noticed she had this habit of conflating our identities even though we’re not the same kind of person and don’t look alike either. She makes these comparisons that make no sense and it sometimes feels like she lives in some internal delusion and I’m just a character in her fantasy that she projects onto. So, it doesn’t matter what I actually say or am going through, the narrative resets back to what she’s decided it is. 

Two weeks ago, I finally snapped after she ignored my request for rest during recovery from a biopsy. She kept texting me random stuff and I didn’t respond. So, she asked how I was and I told her I was in pain and needed rest. She immediately sent a barrage of texts and photos about her day as though she was just waiting for me to wake up and respond so she could flood into my phone and mind with her own stuff. I told her she was self-absorbed and went into detail about why I was done. To be clear, this was not the first and only warning. I’d been pulling back for some time and had told her I needed more space in my life. But the more I took space, the more she attempted to occupy it with conversations becoming more and more one-sided until I was receiving ever increasing details that were *increasingly* banal and unnecessary (i.e. telling me details about going to the bathroom!). I started to realise it was deliberate.

Since pulling back, I feel like a fog has lifted. She’s already trying to push us back into old patterns, repeating behaviors I directly called out. I feel I’ve given her more attention and patience than she ever gave me. But she’s pushing to talk and a part of me wonders: do I owe her a final chance to respond, or is it fair to just disengage?",1,1758059062.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

So far, to troubleshoot, I have:  
\-thoroughly cleaned the basket and seal (no change)  
\-tried swapping in an extra seal we have (no change)  
\-ran just straight cycles of water (these always produce the full amount, but then immediately running it with coffee grounds after, we are back to low yield)  
\-changed up my grind to see if maybe our faulty batches were too fine (no change)

Nothing is working. As noted above, I can run it with coffee grounds and it's low, clean it out immediately and run it with just water, and it produces the full amount. So then I thought it had to be the grounds being too fine. We have a generic electric grinder where I put the beans in, pressed down to start the grind and typically counted to 12, and that produced usable grounds. I tried counting to 8 today, making them more coarse, but no luck.

1niuqpv,https://i.redd.it/3psxoxrxjlpf1.jpeg,How to unf*ck your brain,"I spent a solid chunk of last year feeling like my brain is totally f*cked. My energy was none existent. So, I researched a lot and tried a ton of stuff. I tracked everything and made notes each day on how I'm feeling. 

The following is a summary of all the changes that helped me the most. 

(There are sections, but honestly, it all kinda works together.)

---
**LEVEL 1 **

SLEEP: 
Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. 

HYDRATE: 
Carry a water bottle. Drink it. Around 3.5 liters for men and around 2.5 liters for women. Dehydration kills your brain.

SUNLIGHT: 
10-15 mins of morning sunlight (even through a window).It's important to reset your internal clock. You can also get a light therapy lamp for dark winter days.

MOVE YOUR DAMN BODY:
Quick Walks: Clears the head, gets blood pumping.

Desk Stretches:
1.	Neck Tilts & Rotations
2.	Shoulder Rolls (Forward & Back): Release the tension.
3.	Cat-Cow: Mobilize your spine.

**Seriously, 5 mins a few times a day makes a HUGE difference to blood flow and focus!**

FIX YOUR POSTURE: 
Hunching kills blood flow to your brain and gives you neck ache. Get yourself a standing desk / Laptop stand + decent chair + consciously sitting/standing taller


**LEVEL 2: Blood and Food**

- GET YOUR BLOOD CHECKED: Went to the doc, demanded comprehensive bloods. Low Vitamin D, B12, and borderline iron.

*Seriously, if you feel chronically shit, this is step one*

FOOD INTOLERANCE:  
Always had a weird stomach. Did a food intolerance test (get a decent one). Turns out, dairy and gluten were absolutely destroying my stomache with inflammation, making my brain feel like sh*t. 
Your food influences your brain, so make sure you eat right.


**LEVEL 3: Showers, Supplements, Breathing**

COLD SHOWERS: 
Started with 30 secs of cold at the end of my normal shower. Now up to 2 mins full cold. You get insane energy from that! Definitely worth a try. 

GREEN TEA + L-THEANINE > COFFEE:
Swapped my coffee for green tea and L-Theanine supplement = Clean, calm, focused energy instead of that jittering feeling.

BOX BREATHING:

1. Inhale for 4 seconds

2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds

3. Exhale slowly for 4 seconds

4. Hold again for 4 seconds

Repeat for 2–5 minutes. It’s great for calming your nervous system and getting better focus.

CHEW GUM (WHEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS): 
It surprisingly works for studying/deep work by increasing blood flow to the brain.

**LEVEL 4: Fix Your Attention Span**

GRAYSCALE YOUR PHONE: 
I legit have zero desire to scroll.

UNFOLLOW them: 
Kept actual friends + maybe 5 accounts that actually teach me something. Unfollowed the rest.

APP BLOCKERS: 
Blocked Reddit, Youtube and so on during focused work blocks.

NOTIFICATIONS: OFF (MOSTLY): 
You probably need a damn ping every 5 seconds.


**LEVEL 5: Supplements & Systems**

MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (BEFORE BED): 
Helped with sleep quality

OMEGA-3s (FISH OIL/ALGAE OIL): 
Reduces inflammation, good for you mood, increases cognitive performance

GET YOUR EYES CHECKED:
Had a tiny vision issue I ignored. New glasses = headaches GONE by 90%. Less eye strain = less headache.

I recently put together a quick 2-day itinerary for Rome that hits all the highlights and still leaves time to relax. Perfect if you’re short on time but want a taste of the city:

Day 1 – Arrival & Historic Center

12:00–14:00: Arrive downtown (Metro B from Magliana → Colosseo, change at Piramide). Grab lunch with a view of the Colosseum.

14:00–18:30: Check out the Colosseum and Imperial Forums outside, stroll to Piazza Venezia & Altare della Patria (optional climb), then Pantheon & Piazza Navona (coffee break included!).

19:00–22:00: Dinner in Campo de’ Fiori or Trastevere, then head back by taxi or public transport.

Day 2 – Vatican & City Highlights

08:30–13:00: Early start at Vatican Museums (book online!), guided tour including the Sistine Chapel, finish at St. Peter’s Square.

13:00–14:30: Lunch near the Vatican.

14:30–18:30: Walk from Castel Sant’Angelo → Piazza di Spagna via Via dei Coronari, Piazza del Popolo, Pincio Terrace. Kids? Stop at Villa Borghese/Casina di Raffaello.

19:00–22:00: Dinner near Trevi Fountain, enjoy the evening ambiance, then head back.

💡 Quick Tip: Wear comfy shoes and book Vatican tickets ahead – it makes a huge difference!

*  parappa is so infatuated with sunny that he's oblivious to anyone else ever being romantic to him. he could come across the most bombshell attractive, flirty person in the world trying to make a move on him and he'd just think of them as a nice individual trying to make friends because he's so infatuated with sunny to even consider anything else (which is why he was oblivious to hugging and kissing PJ in the romantic love stage)

* parappa and PJ are pretty good at skateboarding (i swear i saw official art of them skateboarding once but i dont remember)

* parappa would never do drugs in a million years. PJ def would but tells parappa he would never to make him happy, lol

* lammy is a coffee and caffeine addict. ma-san is a tea addict

Long time lurker and first time poster. I've gained so much helpful support from the subreddit that I just wanted to share what I found helpful and what ultimately aided in my success on my GRE.

**The Study Strategy:**

I had a relatively short GRE study plan given I decided I wanted to pursue it rather late. I would study 1-2 hours a couple days a week, take practice exams on weekends, and in the two weeks leading up to the exam, I ramped up my studying significantly (\~3 hours a night and a full day on the penultimate day). Doing vocabulary on my commute was helpful in getting familiar with some of the common words, but definitely had to spend more dedicated time studying during the two week sprint. Admittedly, I vastly underpracticed my AWA (only doing 2 in advance), but I was a bit more worried about my Q and V scores based on initial evaluations. For all of my practice, I kept notebooks where I would alternate my quantitative and verbal practice, and I circled/highlighted/boxed tips I would want to review. 

I would by no means say that this is a fool-proof study strategy, but it is what I ended up doing.

**The Helpful Things:**

1. Gregmat Quant Easy to Hard Topic-Based Study. This really helped me hone my weaknesses based on my scores and gives a great overview of useful tips and tricks. I was a bit overwhelmed in the beginning so I started here. For example, combinatorics really kicked my butt so I spent some time developing a consistent strategy to approach them (often require one-part common sense and one-part math). Using this to benchmark my growth (taking them at the beginning and end of my study journey) was really helpful in concept retention.

2. Intensely reviewing vocabulary in the short-term. Like most people, I have a stronger short-term memory, so reviewing a wide array of vocabulary terms in the day and hours leading up to the test was really helpful during the exam itself, as it was fresh in the mind. As compared to math strategies, which I practiced to be a bit more ""knee-jerk"", the vocabulary was a bit more surface-memorized. I even wrote down the hardest words on my scrap paper as soon as I sat down for the test so I wouldn't forget them (didn't end up being on my exam, but could have been useful).

3. Speed >>> and not skipping any solution explanations. The main limiting factors in my early performance was using correct but slow methods to solve quantitative problems, as I would panic towards the end and miss questions for no good reason. I recommend that even for questions you get correct on Gregmat or any other test prep website, you check out the solution video just in case they solved it in a way that was more efficient. This helped me immensely in speeding up my growth and learning new tricks.

4. AWA Commonalities. As all of the prompts are out in the open, I spent the night prior generating a bunch of different essay structures for each prompt. I then compared the examples and results used for each point and see what had broad applicability. This helped me narrow down the number of real-world examples I had to remember. The essay structure I found the most useful was what I termed the ""flip-flop-balance essay"", which argued one side, the other side, and ultimately centered on the value of a balanced approach. This ensured I would have ample material to write on, as I found focusing on a single side for the whole essay often led to points that bled into each other/were overall weaker. As my background is in engineering and healthcare, I pulled mainly from my field for examples, as it helped me worry less about memorizing (and potentially getting wrong) different facts.

Other than that, I will say I also tried to game my focus for the day-of the exam (i.e. drinking coffee long enough before to ensure I would use the bathroom in advance and the energy would kick in, but not so long in advance that I had an energy crash). If it helps soothe anyone's anxieties, I would say the Gregmat practice exams (and much of the practice material) are vastly harder than the real exam. In fact, I was so shocked at the comparative difficulty that I thought I got the easy Q/V sections and accepted my demise during the exam. So I was really shocked to see the scores pop up!

Happy to answer questions if there's anything else I missed, but thanks again for helping me on this journey.",2,1758058321.0,GRE,2,1.0,False

1niub6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/1niub6y/ttc_but_two_early_loses/,TTC but two early loses?,"I’m 32F and my partner 31M are TTC. We both eat well, exercise regularly and don’t smoke or drink.
My second cycle TTC has just passed after having my copper IUD removed in early August. 

I thought my partner and I were lucky enough to have conceived on our first try. The symptoms that were different to my normal cycle were that I had very sore breasts within days of ovulation, I felt very calm with no mood swings, my constant acne cleared and I felt like I was carrying. I also had a dream I was pregnant. I even cut out caffeine even though I love a good morning coffee. I did notice a constant twinge in my left side which I was conscious of. I did 3 tests all which returned negative (one maybe had a very faint line?). One was a day before my expected period and two were after. Then on day 3 after my expected AF date I woke up with severe cramps. I normally have light cramps in the week leading up to my period so this was abnormal. I went to work, in pain and rushed to the bathroom because I thought I was about to have an explosive bowl movement to find bright red blood, and a lot. That evening I removed my menstrual cup in the shower and the blood was very different to what I get on my period. It was a large volume for me and very stringy. I saw what looked like a white clump of cells about 6mm long. The next morning the tenderness in my breasts was gone and my “period” lasted 2 days and was heavy. My normal period is 5-7 days and light-moderate bleeding.

This cycle I was prepped with ovulation tests and we completed the task on time. The next cycle I had the same symptoms as the last without the PMS symptoms or one sided twinges. I did panic a few nights ago when I woke up feeling like one breast had shrunk but both breasts were still tender. Otherwise, all was normal until this morning, 13 DPO, when I woke up with mild cramps that turned into severe cramps again, and cue the bleeding again. Once I started bleeding my cramps vanished. I had been planning to test on day 2 of my expected cycle. 

I’m gutted and though I don’t return positive tests for either cycle I believe that we had conceived and now I’m left feeling empty and confused. Despite this I am considering the past two early losses though the internet says that unless I returned a positive test they aren’t? So I’m almost gaslighting myself and second guessing my instinct. 

Looking forward I’m considering changing my supps, for which I’m currently taking a prenatal incl folate and iodine, and taking CoQ10 and melatonin to aid sleep. I’m also considering asking my partner to take men’s fertility supps. He is very supportive and has been amazing. 

We both know to expect it not to happen immediately and I’m very grateful to know I can conceive (I believe) but I’m frustrated that it won’t stick. I know it’s most likely down to chromosomal abnormalities but it’s hard to accept when there’s no proof. 

I know there are a lot of people on here who have been TTC for years but would like to know how their journey started and have they experienced multiple early miscarriages or chemical pregnancies? I’m prepping myself for the long slog of the dreaded TWW and monthly emotional turmoil.

If I experience this for a third cycle in a row I will go see the doctor to explore my options for testing etc. I’m having those thoughts like “am I problem?” 
Has anyone experienced anything similar with unconfirmed early loss/symptoms? And what has your TTC journey been like?

1niu2z6,https://www.reddit.com/r/burnedout/comments/1niu2z6/burnout_with_allostatic_overload/,Burnout with allostatic overload,"Hi fellow cooked people - I am making this post to start discussion about allostatic load, and more importantly **allostatic overload**, as I have not seen a lot of discussion about these concepts on the internet, and I believe it may be quite useful in understanding some cases of burnout. 

  
What is allostatic load and allostatic overload? 

>**Allostatic load** = the “wear and tear” from repeated stress.

>**Allostatic overload** = when stress exceeds recovery capacity, leading to breakdown in sleep, appetite, energy, mood—the state often called burnout.

Now, your case of burnout may not be associated with an allostatic overload, but I am not an expert. The manifestation of an overload is mostly physical, and it seems to me that when we discuss burnout, we tend to discuss more the psychological side of it. In worst cases, it may be both.   
  
So for example, in my case, my burnout firstly manifested through a physical crash, which entails the following:  
\- severe tiredness through the day which made work impossible  
\- insatiable hunger, I am not talking ""being a bit hungry"", I am talking a feeling of having a bottomless pit in the stomach that won't go away. This isn't a psychological hunger, it's a physical one - I genuinely felt like I needed to eat something like 5000 kcal a day, and in the evening before bed I would still sometimes feel like ""hm, I could have more"".   
\- early waking up - this was actually the first symptom that appeared and the one I should have followed - as soon as the daylight shows up (meaning 5am in the summer) - I am wide awake and unable to fall asleep. This is due to cortisol spikes, which in the case of a person undergoing burn out, are very high.   
\- completely crashed heart rate variability (HRV) - if you have a wearable device that tracks this, you will notice you are chronically way below baseline

The psychological element in my burnout is secondary to these physical crashes - it took me a long time to accept that something is very wrong since up until this point I genuinely believed I enjoy my work, and while that can be true, it is obvious that some things will need to change in terms of my relationship to work, and how much I take on. 

I am currently on a sick leave while I recover. After my manager and I realized what is happening, I first took 3 weeks off, which was enough for sleep to normalize (it takes a while until you stop waking up early) and for HRV and daily functioning to start climbing up. So after that, I thought to myself ""great, let's slowly return to work"" - major mistake. After 4 hours of remote, casual work, it induced a crash all over again with all the symptoms listed above, and while I may not be back at square one, I sure did induce a setback. 

What I am trying to say is that I am suffering first from an allostatic overload, and secondly from what we describe as burnout, but I must also note that to me it seems that the exact definition of a burnout is also nebulous, and can include several different things. Point is, research has come up with this allostasis concept, which to me seems not yet sufficiently tied to burnout, but it could be massively helpful for some people in understanding what is going on them. 

  
So what is the recovery? Well, firstly it's the physical stabilization, which means **no work, no activity, no sports, no nothing** basically for several weeks until your nervous system rebuilds basic capacity for dealing with stressors. In my case, the initial 3 weeks of this did wonders, but since I tried to return to work too early, I am now again on week 2, and I reckon I will need at least another 2-3 weeks until I can leave my apartment for longer than 30 minutes a day. I would also recommend doing **no coffee**, because coffee stimulates you very nicely and gives you a feeling of ""huh I'm doing much better today"", but that's not true, coffee is just masking the real fatigue, and you need to feel that fatigue, because that's a signal that you need to rest. I did cold turkey, because I figured ""fuck it, Im fucked anyway, so might as well stack that on top"", and it sucked bad for several days.   
Then you can start thinking about reintroducing things in your life again, but I am honestly not at that stage yet, and I am also not at the stage of fully knowing what I need to implement in my life specifically, but it's clear that things will have to change, and that my over-ambition has led me to this.

Fire should be added in the mini fireplace (where it’s close). It would be nice if someone actually did editing like this before (furnishings). 

Steps for editing:

1. Lighting & Mood
	•	Brighten overall exposure so details pop
	•	Increase contrast & clarity for sharp lines
	•	Warm tones subtly (golden hour / beige)

2. Background & Environment
	•	Blur or soften busy backgrounds
	•	Remove distractions (plants, jacuzzi, leaves, stains, reflections, shadows)
	•	Extend floor/background for minimal, endless look

3. Colors & Surfaces
	•	Clean up whites on cushions (pure white or light grey)
	•	Add subtle highlights/reflections on metal/glass (fireplace)

4. Composition Polish
	•	Symmetry & balance
	•	Align multiple pieces perfectly straight

5. Magazine-Like Touch 
	•	Slight vignette to focus on furniture (optional)
	•	Subtle depth-of-field / lens blur

Extras:
	•	Add realistic fire in the mini fireplace

Goal:
	•	Clean, crisp, warm lighting = luxury
	•	No clutter, harsh shadows, or dull cushions
	•	Make furniture look like art in a gallery

I had a drainless full TT, MR, and flank lipo. I also recieved the Exparel shots. 
To prepare, starting 2 weeks out I used the Alastin reform cream, ate lots of fresh pineapple, added collagen powder to my coffee or water once a day, along with all of the everyday healthy lifestyle (water, high protein, daily walks). 
At 1 week out I started Colace daily and added in a lot more fiber. Smoothies were great for this! Aloe juice, frozen pineapple, frozen raspberries, 2 clemetines, spinach, cucumber, and chia seeds is my favorite. 
Reading, long walks, and hot tea really helped calm me. 
SOMEHOW I even had the best sleep I've had in ages last night. I didn't even make it through the first inning of a late baseball game (go Phils!!!) 
I have no expectations and l know things can change by the hour. I'm staying on top of my meds and taking a 5 minute walk around the house every hour. Dr sent me home with leg compression boots.

Then the weekends, great, I feel asleep early around 10pm, before bed I would feel great and say to myself, let’s break the cycle and wake at 6am! I would wake up around 3am and can’t fall back to sleep. 

I work out a little, drink coffee and try to carry myself till 10pm, but no, that day I am gonna feel sleepy at 5pm! If I take a nap, even only for 30 minutes, I will somehow be so clear and awake until 3am again.

I don’t like the taste of alcohol, I try medicine but they still can’t break this weird cycle. There is one week, I probably only slept for 2 hours everyday and on Friday I called sick because I felt I was gonna drop dead and I still couldn’t fall sleep at home as it was a big week to me.

A week ago got another apology and him feeling ashamed of treating me the way he did and being distant when I needed him most. Asked for a coffee meetup even if it’s just to sit together in silence. 

I declined the offer saying it’s too soon (2 months) and then he sent me some smooth talking voicenote without much substance but about how he basically is thinking of me and will wait till I am ready to talk because my boundaries make sense. 

Was somewhat easy to navigate that in the moment and not give away any warmth, just respond to logistics and such, but few days later have this urge to send clarifying messages like: you say you miss me, what are you actually offering ? You’re not mentioning any changes that would make it easy for me to hear you out. And I am stopping myself , because it’s coaching… and I want that to come from him. 

Besides as far as I know he is still heavily with his monkey branch and I don’t want to even be friends in that triangle…. He is not being clear on what he wants out of a coffee. For all I know it could be some last closure talk and I don’t want it… 

Struggling today that I am not flexible enough and not willing to hear him out when it looks and sounds like word soup of vagueness….

I moved to London at the beginning of this year and have been enjoying my days a lot (apart from the days in winter when it was dark by 3 pm...). I'm from Canada and decided to move here to fight my inner demons (Read: I wanted a change of pace and experience European culture).

I want to meet a girl to go to museums with, to visit Christmas markets with, to talk about deep topics with coffee on the balcony at 10 pm with, to go on weekend trips to Italy and see Roman statues and have authentic pizza with, but most of all, someone who simply enjoys my company as much I enjoy theirs.

About myself, I'm 26, Asian, 6 feet, and ever since I moved here, I've been doing a hella more cooking so I'm sure I can whip up a feast for you when you visit! I play games a lot on my PC, and my most played recently is Dead by Daylight, it's the only game where you can see characters from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Halloween, and Alien all work together to repair some scuffed generators.

I've been playing Silksong and suffering from the bosses like everyone else, but I think it proves that I'm into masochism :) I started bouldering recently and I think the climbing process is quite like how I have to climb Mount Fey in Silksong, so I basically imagine that I'm the MC in the climbing gym even if I'm climbing the most basic courses.

1nittx5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ActuallyReviewed/comments/1nittx5/does_nehemiah_tide_rescue_laundry_stain_remover/,Does Nehemiah Tide Rescue Laundry Stain Remover Really Work?,"I’ve had the chance to try out the Nehemiah B0F8Q6MZLM Tide Rescue Laundry Stain Remover Spray paired with the Tide To Go Pen for a couple of weeks now. Life, as expected, has thrown its fair share of messy situations my way, from chaotic family dinners to stubborn coffee spills at work. This product was put to the test almost immediately, proving whether it could handle everyday challenges or if it was another over-hyped purchase. Spoiler alert: I was pleasantly surprised—but there’s more to the story.

**Design and Packaging**  
Right out of the box, the 22 fl oz laundry spray bottle and pocket-sized stain pen seemed practical and purpose-driven. The spray bottle is ergonomically designed, making it easy to hold, even with wet hands, during laundry sessions. The bright label clearly outlines instructions, which is always a bonus because I’m not one for deciphering cryptic usage manuals. The Tide To Go Pen? Compact enough to stash in my glove compartment, handbag, or even my jacket pocket. It’s the kind of design that screams functionality. However, I did notice that the spray bottle could’ve done with a better nozzle. A couple of sprays felt uneven, with more product coming out than necessary.  

**Ease of Use**  
Everyday stains, meet your worst enemy. Using the stain spray was straightforward: a quick spritz on the mess, a five-minute wait (just enough time to scroll through some memes), and then tossing the clothes into the wash. No scrubbing frenzy or elbow grease needed. The Tide To Go Pen, on the other hand, impressed me the most when I was caught off guard by a ketchup splotch on my shirt during lunch. A simple dab and glide later, the stain faded, and I survived my meeting without looking like a toddler learning to eat spaghetti. That said, the pen isn’t magical—it’s most effective on fresh stains, so don’t expect miracles on dried messes.  

[Check Nehemiah B0F8Q6MZLM price on Amazon.](https://info.senaar.com/p/b0f8q6mzlm/)  

**Strengths**  
- Dual-purpose bundle combining a stain remover spray and a portable pen for versatility.  
- Effective on a variety of stains, including grease, makeup, wine, and mud.  
- Works on multiple surfaces like clothing, carpets, and upholstery.  
- Travel-friendly pen that’s perfect for handling accidents on-the-go.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The spray nozzle could be more refined for better control over product usage.  
- Not as effective on older, set-in stains—especially without pre-treating.  
- The pen runs out fairly quickly with frequent use, which might be an issue if you’re as clumsy as me.  

**Performance and Results**  
I decided to put the stain spray to a real test with one of my son’s football practice shirts. After an entire practice session, the grass and mud stains looked like a permanent part of the shirt’s design. A generous spray on the problem areas, a quick wait, and a normal wash cycle later, the shirt came out looking like it hadn’t been through an outdoor battlefield. The travel pen, though, is sensitive to timing. For instance, it managed to handle a chocolate stain beautifully during a work meeting but struggled with older marks on one of my scarves.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
On the market, similar products like OxiClean come to mind. While OxiClean’s sprays and powders are heavy-duty and incredible for laundry, the combination of the Nehemiah spray and Tide To Go pen offers an unmatched level of convenience. Products like Shout or Resolve compare well for specific stain types but lack the dual portable solution that comes sorted in this neat bundle. If portability matters to you, the Nehemiah product truly stands out.  

**True Value**  
We all want our money to work hard, and this product does a decent job at that. While priced slightly higher than competitors like Shout or generic store brands, you’re really paying for versatility and convenience. The dual solution of having a powerful laundry spray for home use and an easy-to-carry pen for life’s unpredictable messes makes it worth considering.

I have an extreme caffiene sensitivity (I cant even handle a cup of coffee so I use 75mg energy drinks when I need to wake up....thats the student life! Even then 75 mg is a lot for my system) and find that when I consume even low amounts of caffiene I endure heart palpitations, shaking, extreme anxiety, insomnia, paranoia, mild indigestion and nausea. I am not having three cups of coffee. I'm having a weak watered down kiddies energy drink. 
I'm 5ft with a bmi of 18.1, which probably dosen’t help, but theres definitely something up with my caffiene tolerance. It also stays in my system longer than it should. I am still feeling the effects (at 10pm) from the 75mg of caffiene I had at 5pm. 
Worth nothing that despite a family history of heart problems, and a squeezing in my chest when I run, I've had a 24 hour holter monitor test, a chest ultrasound, ecg abd street test done, and all readings are normal, so I've been cleared to start medication. When I told the cardiologist about my caffiene sensitivity, he told me I'd just have to ""wait and see"" about the stimulants. 
I know this is silly, and I probably have health anxiety, but please don't take this in the context of a psychological worry. I am genuinely concerned about this. 
I am skeptical of Dr. AI, but a quick search told me that 20 mg vyvanse is about equivalent to 200 mg caffiene, and I cant stress this enough, but as somone barely comfortable on 75 mg caffiene, and who experienced almost unbearable effects from 160mg, I am, to say the least, a bit scared.
Hoping to hear some advice or oppinion on this, as I'm nearly shitting myself with the thought of taking my stimulant tomorrow. 
Tldr: theyre putting me on stimulants. I have severe caffiene sensitivity. Am I going to drop dead?

My son, Liam, had a friend over from school—let’s call him Eli. They’ve been friends for a while, and I get along reasonably well with Eli’s mom.

A couple of days ago, Eli’s mom had told him he needed to be home before dinner because they were going out to eat that night.

While Eli was here, he started acting unusually tired, almost half-asleep. while playing video games. My younger son, Max, seemed concerned; he kept glancing at me and went to get Eli a glass of water. By the time Eli needed to leave to go home, he looked seriously unwell, his face was red, his eyes were glassy with huge pupils, he was shaking, leaning on the wall, and had to take breaks every two steps. When he bent down to get his bag, he nearly crashed into the coffee table, and my oldest son had to catchhim.

I checked for a fever, it felt minimal at most but I decided I could not let him walk home like that. It’s about five blocks from our house. My husband had the car, so I couldn’t drive him, and I was worried that if I walked him home and he fell, I wouldn’t be able to carry him.

I texted Eli’s mom, explaining that her son was in no shape to walk home and asked if she could come get him or if he could stay at our house until I had access to the car.

She texted back, saying to just send him on his way and let him walk home. I replied, explaining again that I really didn’t think he could manage it. She accused me of criticizing her parenting and insisted that if she said to let him walk, I should let him walk. I refused and put the phone down.

Poor Eli ended up sitting on the floor. I helped him onto the couch. Meanwhile, his mom called multiple times. I picked up, and she yelled at me, insisting he was fine to walk. I asked if he had any medical condition; she said nothing was wrong and that he could walk home even though he could barely stand. I hung up.

She eventually drove over angrily to pick him up, dragging him to the car.
I’m scared this situation might affect my son’s friendship with Eli. Maybe I should have trusted her and let him walk, but I really doubt he could have done it safely.

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: A Powerhouse for International Entrepreneurs\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting.*, Bahrain’s non-oil GDP grew by 5.1% over the past year, outpacing the GCC average. Forbes Business highlights the country’s ambitious 2025 Vision, with $45 billion in infrastructure and fintech development set for the next three years.\
The Economic Development Board (EDB) reported over 1,300 new foreign companies registered in 2024 alone, a 17% increase year-on-year. Strategically located between Saudi Arabia and Qatar, with direct access to key Gulf markets, Bahrain’s pro-business environment features:\
\
No personal or corporate income tax\
A highly skilled, multicultural workforce\
World-class connectivity—think the new King Hamad Causeway project\
Transparent legal frameworks, with English widely used in business\
\
The mood on the ground is energetic. In the Seef District, modern coworking spaces buzz with entrepreneurs. Bahrain Bay’s futuristic skyline is now home to regional divisions of Amazon, BNP Paribas, and new digital start-ups alike.\

Foreign Ownership Policies: 100% Foreign-Owned Companies in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration..* Regulatory reforms changed the scene—by 2022, Bahrain allowed 100% foreign ownership in most sectors, including trading, services, manufacturing, and technology.\
2025 Policy Update: What’s New?\
The Ministry of Industry, Commerce & Tourism (MOICT) announced in March 2025 that the list of “foreigner-friendly” business activities expanded again, now covering over 400 activities. See the full list of 100% ownership allowed for foreigners.\
However, some sensitive industries—such as oil extraction, certain telecoms, or media—still require Bahraini majority ownership or special approvals. Always check the Sijilat (the national company registry portal) for the latest status.\
Best Bahrain Entity Types for Foreigners\
Most foreign entrepreneurs choose:\
\
With Limited Liability Company (WLL)\
Single Person Company (SPC)\
Branch of a Foreign Company\
Bahrain Free Zone Entity (for 100% ownership with extra benefits)\
\
Compare business types here: Bahrain business type structures.\
A Practical Example\
When I set up my latest consultancy in the Diplomatic Area in late 2024, I registered as an SPC—enabling me to retain 100% ownership with a single shareholder structure. The online Sijilat portal recognized my activity code (consulting) as eligible for full foreign ownership. No local sponsor needed, and the process took only 6 working days.\
Note: If your planned business activity is still “restricted,” you may need a Bahraini partner (read about 99% options and workarounds here), or consider a local sponsorship model.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: Making the Winning Choice\
A quick comparison with neighbors:\
\
UAE: Free zones offer 100% foreign ownership, but many “mainland” licenses still require a local service agent. Licensing costs and minimum office space requirements are usually higher in Dubai or Abu Dhabi.\
Saudi Arabia: Foreigners need a Saudi partner in most sectors, with high capital requirements and longer approval times.\
\
Bahrain’s combination of mainland 100% foreign ownership, streamlined regulations, and flexible office solutions puts it ahead for many startups and regional HQs. And local business customs are refreshingly pragmatic: a handshake at a majlis can move things faster than a formal meeting (my favorite “insider” tip for real progress!).\
\
Business Formation Process: Step-by-Step, Insider’s Edition\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.:\
1. Define Your Activity & Ownership Structure\
Check Sijilat for activity code eligibility (or use Keylink’s free evaluation).\
Tip: Consulting, IT, trading, and most services qualify for 100% foreign ownership.\
2. Prepare Your Documents\
\
Passport copies for all shareholders/directors\
Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement)\
CVs and educational certificates (for certain regulated professions)\
Business plan summary\
No Objection Certificate (if you’re already resident in Bahrain for another purpose)\
\
Shortcuts:\
- Pre-fill Sijilat online; avoid manual data re-entry.\
- Upload high-resolution colored scans; blurry JPEGs will be rejected at MOICT counters.\
3. Reserve Company Name via Sijilat\
\
Smartest to do this before 10am, especially on Sundays, to avoid application backlogs.\
Approved names are valid for 6 months.\
\
4. Register at MOICT\
\
Submit application online via Sijilat portal\
Pay official fees (see cost breakdown below)\
Processing usually takes 5–8 working days\
Collect Commercial Registration (CR) certificate\
\
5. Obtain Municipality Approval\
Depending on your office location (Seef’s new towers process permits faster than Manama’s historic souq blocks—personal lesson learned after waiting four extra days for a downtown address!).\
6. Register with LMRA & Open Bank Account\
\
Labor Market Regulatory Authority (LMRA) registration for work permits\
Open a corporate bank account (most banks require your physical presence)\
Some banks now offer expedited digital onboarding—ask at Bahrain Bay branches!\
\
7. Additional Licenses\
Sectors like finance, health, or education may need extra approvals. The EDB is extremely helpful—stop by their Diplomatic Area office for a quick coffee and guidance (they serve excellent cardamom-scented coffee and actually answer emails fast—a rarity regionally).\

Document Shortcuts: Prepare all documents in both PDF and hard copy—some counter staff prefer printouts\
Network Wisely: Accept invitations for Arabic coffee—many regulatory clarifications truly happen informally\
\

\
Tangent: Ramadan Timing, Coffee Rituals, and Why They Matter\
Bahrain’s business pace shifts during Ramadan: office hours are shorter, but after-Iftar meetings blossom. I once sealed a multinational partnership at a majlis in Juffair, after the 10th cup of gahwa. These traditions may seem off-topic, but understanding them builds the rapport that can speed up everything from approvals to office searches.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & 100% Foreign Ownership\
Can I really own 100% of my business in Bahrain as a foreigner?\
\
Yes—if your business activity is on the MOICT’s expanded eligibility list (now more than 400 approved in 2025), you can own your company outright. Check eligible activities here.\
\
Are there sectors where 100% ownership isn’t allowed?\
\
A few restricted sectors (defense, oil, specific telecoms) require Bahraini majority partners or special licensing. When in doubt, consult Sijilat or your corporate service provider.\
\
How much do I need to budget for company formation?\
\
Minimum all-in formation costs start from BHD 1,000–2,500 for a basic SPC or WLL, exclusive of office rent and additional licenses. Full cost details.\
\
Is a local sponsor or partner required?\
\
For most activities—no. But for restricted sectors, yes. Understand local sponsorship here.\
\
What are ongoing compliance requirements?\
\
Annual CR renewals, basic bookkeeping, VAT returns (if applicable), and labor reporting. See Bahrain compliance services.\
\
\
\
Bahrain in 2025 is the GCC’s best-kept secret for foreign entrepreneurs. With a little local insight and smart planning, full foreign ownership is not only possible but practical—opening doors to the Gulf and beyond.\

1nitlwb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nitlwb,1 year plant journey anniversary,"I started my serious plant journey one year ago today. I had only 5 plants back then and have just shy of 50 now not including propagations. I decided last year that I would get one plant per week until I felt I had enough plants to handle without being overwhelmed, which still has not happened. My favorite plant types are philos, monsteras, anthuriums, alocasias, begonias and epipremnum (pothos) and my least favorites are ZZ's and Oxalis but I'm trying to get better with those. I have 5 plants on moss poles (Monstera, Thai Con, BMF, Verrucosum, Epipremnum pinnatum marble variegata) and have 5 more to pole up before winter; (Splendid, Glorious, El Choco Red, Esqueleto, Cebu Blue). 

My first plant was an Alocasia green dragon scale, which has still been my most challenging plant to keep happy but remains to be one of my favorites. 

I bought most of my plants from big box stores and local nurseries but this spring and summer I began to order plants online from Palmstreet (I live in the midwest so had to wait for winter to end) and I am very happy with the service and sellers, I have not had a bad experience as of yet.  

Education - When I first stared my journey, I watched about 100 hours of youtube plant channels and absorbed as much knowledge as possible, my favorite channels are - Kill This Plant, Sheffield Made Plants, Sydney Plant Guy, plantsbymelissa, The Jungle Haven. I learned from these youtube channel how to make custom soil mixes and I went all in and bought all the ingredients to make my own soil depending on the plant needs. 

Soil - My plant pantry consists of Fox Farms Oceans Floor soil (base), coco coir, coco chips, grades 1,2,3 perlite, grade 2 pumice, orchid bark, vermiculite, horticultural charcoal, worm castings, sand, lava rock, sphagnum moss, LECA. I just love being able to whip up a batch of whatever I need before potting/repotting. 

Watering - I use Brita filtered tap water left overnight with 9-12 drops of Stress Coat, before watering I add Fox Farm Grow Big 6-4-4 to every watering except on flushes. Once per month I will add CalMag and Silica to the heavy feeders. I dunk my plants in clear plastic containers of every size for bottom watering & I am able to see the plant soak up the water from the bottom, which is very satisfying. 

Containers - For pots I use all clear plastic, its great to be able to see the roots! For planters, I shop at TjMaxx where they always have lots of super cheap ceramic planters. I use large coffee cups for smaller plants.

Moss Poles - I use pre-filled Duspro poles but I tear out all the moss/bark that they come with at replace with New Zealand sphagnum moss. I know this is not efficient but I have too many poles to change course at the moment. 

Lighting - I face southwest but don't get full sun until late in the day, so I use (2) Sansi lights and (2) Barinna T10's.  

Pest battles so far - Spider Mites on (2) plants, used sexy plant juice combo with Dead Bug Brew did the trick. Mealy bugs on (8) plants, these are such a nuisance; they just keep showing up on new plants. Sexy plant juice, alcohol swabs, and finally went nuclear with (50) Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (beetles) that prey on Mealies (purchased from Nature's Good Guys). Even after letting them feast on my infested plants a few pests persisted but continued alcohol swabs on the leaves and stems is working fine. Fungus gnats are still the easiest to kill; I just sprinkle a small layer of diatomaceous earth (DE) on the top soil and they die off really fast (note - you must bottom water for this approach because wet DE doesn't work.) Items I always keep in stock - cold pressed Neem oil, Capt Jack's Dead Bug Brew, Isopropyl 70%, insecticidal soap spray, Dr. Bronner's peppermint castille soap, diatomaceous earth, Mosquito Bits. I use my bedroom and/or bathroom for quarantining infested and/or new plants. 
          
Favorite tools that I find invaluable - foldable plant potting mat with buttoned corners, moisture meter, light meter, chopsticks, rubber tipped tweezers, squeeze-water bottle with spout (for moss pole watering), gardening Velcro, small paintbrushes (for repotting/gently removing soil from the roots), Milliliter dropper (for Stress Coat and CalMag), clear plastic buckets in multiple sizes, broiler pan (for letting large plants drain into after watering dunk), microfiber gloves (for leaf cleaning), misting spray bottle.

1nitlku,https://i.redd.it/umemoap0clpf1.jpeg,Which joint/connection option to use for coffee mug shelf,"I'm still very much a beginner woodworker and I'm wanting to make my own coffee mug holder like the one below. I bought hard maple to make it and am wondering what the easiest but still strong option I can go for connecting the boards. For reference I plan to store mugs on here and maybe a small potted plant or two plus some other decor if there's room.

Would just glue and nails be strong enough for that? If not I was thinking pocket holes or going all out and doing some actual wood joints like rabbits for the corners and dados for the inside shelves. Id like to do the glue on nails as it's the quickest and I need to replace the mug holder I'm using now as it's about to fail. As I'm typing this out though I'm realizing it's probably not much more time to do actual joints since I have the tools for it.

I recently built an app called *Caffeine Tracker (Kafi)* to better manage my coffee habits, and thought some of you might find it useful too.

**Key features:**

* Visualize your caffeine intake with daily, weekly, and hourly charts.
* See how caffeine metabolizes in your body and how much will remain by bedtime.
* Built-in database for popular drinks (Starbucks, Costa, etc.) + option to add your own custom drinks.
* Apple Health integration to connect caffeine intake with sleep and wellbeing.

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions — what works, what could be better! 😊

1nith5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1nith5b/new_to_this_stuff/,new to this stuff,"hello

last year in April I was given a regimen of augmentin for a very mild sinus infection that really ruined my gut health, it took easily 9 or 10 months of eating healthy probiotic foods/prebiotic foods and taking probiotics to get to a place where I was comfortable again....really a horrible situation, I also missed a lot of work because of it. dont play around with antibiotics people, they are no joke. it caused the most startling chest pains and even made breathing hard at times....it was very scary for someone who has never been through something like this before, you think that you are having a heart attack or something and will end up in the hospital dead...very alarming. it doesn't help either when some people around you don't understand, and when you explain the symptoms you are having they say things like ""well you must be having an anxiety issue or a type of panic attack."" the point i guess is someone will never know what it's like until it happens to them, and let's just see how they handle it.

I went a period of several months with no digestive issues feeling normal again, probably from November 2024 to may 2025. now rewind about 3 months ago and it's back. the digestive discomfort, trapped gas pains and constipation type symptoms. really confusing. only this time...I experienced acid reflux for the first time. really really nasty experience. I don't know how people with gerd or severe reflux live like that, lots of credit to them. it manifests as an annoying sour taste in my throat, sometimes if I even eat a piece of broccoli or cheese, a couple minutes later there is the sour taste. it does subside though after 15 or 20 minutes, especially if I drink water. I don't have heartburn or pain though from this reflux. so, for the first time this year I finally saw a gastroenterologist because I should not be dealing with this crap. 2 weeks ago I had an endoscopy done. I was negative for that bad h pylori bacteria, negative for barretts esophagus condition, no mention of a hernia that people can get that causes reflux. report said my valve to my stomach was hill grade 1 or something, basically a strong normal closing valve with no dysfunction. 

they did find mild inflammation with hemorrhage and erythema, but no ulcers and doctor diagnosed gastritis. they know I'm very against prescriptions because they can cause side effects I don't want to deal with, so I refused to take Proton pump inhibitors. doctor said ok, but said please atleast try otc pepcid for maybe a month to help heal gastritis. so I agreed to that. funny thing is, even with taking pepcid 2 times a day, I still get that sour acid taste in my mouth, especially after drinking coffee. I guess I am foolish to think pepcid will prevent acid reflux from even happening. the doctor assured me when the gastritis is healed, my reflux will go away because according to him the gastritis is causing reflux issues. i really hope he is right. he also made no mention of thinking I have gerd disease or anything like that. he also told me even losing 10-15 pounds of excess weight would drastically reduce reflux issues and often people stop getting reflux completely if they shed a decent amount of excess weight. I'm overweight by 20 or 30 pounds probably. 

my real question is, if I don't really have stomach ulcers or open sores just mild inflammation is pepcid even really necessary for this? am I unrealistic to believe reducing my natural stomach acid levels even for short term will still eventually hurt me more? should I just not take the pepcid and focus on my food choices instead and reduce my caffeine intake? I'm just confused about what I should really do. if anyone has advice for me or tips it would be greatly appreciated.

well thanks for hearing me out and my long winded story

It was a pretty good work environment (compared to the other places I've worked) and all around a pretty good job. I received training, uniform, there were always managers, and higher ups making sure we were doing things correctly. 

Fast forward to 10 years later, same store. It's been about a week since I started. No uniform, just a hat. No training, except for a quick little refresh of back-cash. No training videos either. They have had me working since orientation with no non-slip shoes. They said they could order some through the McDonald's employee thing - i asked about it, and a different manager told me to just buy my own. I don't know if im making things correctly (such as iced coffee, etc), i have no idea where things are. I know a lot of things have changed since I worked there previously, but it has really gone downhill in this same store. I am honestly appalled. One of the shift managers was on-mic in the drive through cussing and complaining about a customer. 

What can I do? any time I try to bring up I need to do the training videos or need shoes / shirt. they just say ok. then never help me or do anything. I know theyre busy and understaffed . But It's a little crazy and concerning. I heard a lot of things changed since covid and I have no idea if im even doing things correctly. thankfully I have some memory of how to do things when I worked there previously, but not a lot.

Should I just tough it out? I've tried talking to the GM (the person who hired me, she knew me when I worked there previously, she didnt used to be the GM, but now she runs the store thats not going well.) no luck.

1nitbzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychologyofsex/comments/1nitbzu/is_my_friend_just_mirroring_me_or_could_this_be/,"Is my friend just mirroring me, or could this be tied to deeper psychological issues?","I’m in my early 30s, and I’ve had this friend for a couple of years. At first, I thought we were just very similar—same taste in clothes, music, and hobbies. But my sister pointed out that it seems like my friend is emulating me, and since then I’ve started noticing a consistent pattern.

Examples:
	•	I buy a coat → she buys the same one.
	•	I try a new hairstyle or lip color → she follows.
	•	I start a hobby (like clay modeling) → she joins the next class.
	•	I start dating on apps (which she used to criticize) → within a month, she’s on Hinge.
	•	I make a new friend → she connects with them too. But she’s never introduced me to her own friends. If I don’t include her in something, she’ll make backhanded comments like, “I expected an invite.”

So it’s not just fashion or hobbies—it’s also social dynamics and even dating decisions.

Then another detail started bothering me: when I helped her pack and move, I realized she has hoarding tendencies. Not just “multiple colors of the same top” (though that was there too), but things like:
	•	Five portable coffee machines.
	•	30+ Stanley-cup-style water bottles.
	•	An entire IKEA chest of drawers filled with unopened perfumes.
	•	Four bottles of the exact same hair oil from 2014, still sealed.

I don’t know if these two things are connected (the mirroring + the hoarding), but together they make me wonder if something deeper is going on—like insecurity, identity issues, or even compulsive behavior.

So my questions are:
	•	From a psychological perspective, could this mirroring just be admiration?
	•	Or could it reflect something like a dependency, lack of identity, or hoarding-related behavior?
	•	Most importantly, how do I assess whether I’m simply overthinking this, or if the dynamic is genuinely unhealthy?",0,1758055691.0,psychologyofsex,1,0.21,False

I still can't believe you got a visa.

They're very hard to get. 

But I'm so happy you're here, that I get to show you a little of my life here.

Right now, it's just past 06:30 and everyone but the sun and my sister are up. She's always been a late riser, but she'll get up eventually, and she'll be sharp as a tack right away. I'm more like my dad, up with the alarm clock but not really awake until a half-hour later.

He's shaving. I bet he nicks himself.

And mom and grandma are in the kitchen, making breakfast with whatever we managed to get yesterday. I'd absolutely kill for an egg, but what they're making does smell good.

Coffee?

Sometimes. Other times we get by on roasted barley with chicory.

My grandpa told us how, during the war, they'd make tea by steeping black, burnt bread crusts in water until the water turned brown. I'm so glad we don't have to do that anymore. We have real tea sometimes now.

Anyway, let's have a bite to eat, and then I'll show you what our days are like.

Sit anywhere you like. It's a small table, but we'll all fit. You're probably not used to tight spaces like these. You do get used to it. I've been living here almost my whole life. My parents were allocated this unit after my sister was born and we met the minimum family replacement size. No, we can't sell it, but it's ours until we don't need it anymore. Everyone of value gets a place to live.

“I'll wait for meat today,” mom says.

Grandma's staying home. Grandpa will try to get butter and milk. “What about you, dad?”

“Nails. Maybe soap.”

And my sister will get bread.

As for us, we'll try to get something special, a rarity. I'm off from school today so it's a “free” day for me. Whatever we get is a bonus.

OK, let's head out.

It's a nice day but you should probably take a jacket. It rains here out of the blue sometimes.

We go out of the unit, down the stairs because the elevator doesn't work, then out of the apartment block. There's a metal playground on the left, but it's empty of children because it's a school day. Surrounding us are generally more buildings identical to the one I live in, and then an exit toward the road. Few cars go by. Instead, most people are on foot, lined up on the sidewalk going both directions.

We join.

“What's that way?” I ask, pointing south.

“Fruit, coal and herring,” somebody says without looking at us. “Or so I hear.”

“And north?”

“Chocolate. That's what I always hope for. Maybe one day. I had chocolate once, a decade ago…”

“So these people don't know what they’re lining up for?” you ask me.

“Usually they have some idea, but not always. But there's always something at the start of a lineup. Otherwise people wouldn't line up.”

“How do they have time to just stand there?”

“Most of them don't work. The government is very efficient, so only the ones who need to work, work. The ones good at what they're doing. Everybody else, the normal people, we line up to get what the government provides. I know it's very different from the system you're used to.”

We stand in the line going north.

Slowly, we move.

Eventually, about an hour later, we come to an intersection. The roads are still empty, save for the odd black car every once in a while, which honks and whom we make way for, so our lineup crosses the intersection at a diagonal, intersecting at one point with a line going a different direction.

“Keep right for chocolate?” I ask.

“Chocolate? This is the queue for vodka and beets,” says an elderly man.

“And the other one?”

He looks at me, at you. “Refrigerator sign-ups.”

“If you want chocolate, there's a rumour they're giving it out on Potomskaya Street,” someone yells from within one of the two lineups.

“Wishful thinking!” yells another.

We merge into the other lineup and continue, passing people on the right when we can. Some give us dirty looks. Others smile at us because we're young and have so much ahead of us. “Sorry, we're not queuing here. We're just trying to get through,” I offer repeatedly as an explanation.

“Where are we going?” you ask me, as I pull you along. Although this is all so mundane, I'm exhilarated that I get to share it with you. 

“To where the chocolate might be,” I say.

“What if there is no chocolate?”

“Then it'll be like every other day.” But I hope it's not. It can't be. Not with you here.

On the left, we pass a row of makeshift tents, people getting in and out of them. You ask who they are, and I explain that they're prospectors, citizens who attempt to predict the routes of future queues to be able to get a head start on them. “They sleep here?”

“Yes.”

By the time we reach the vicinity of Potomskaya Street, we hear engines and music, and I remember suddenly there's a foreign delegation in the city today, but before I can explain, a police officer stops us.

“Papers,” he says.

I pull mine out, and show him your passport and visa too. He examines the documents closely before handing them back. “Do you have non-queue travel permits?”

“As a student, I'm allowed—”

“Fine, yes.”

“Do you want to see my school identification card?”

“No,” he says. “That's fine.”

“Would it be possible to maybe get close enough to the delegation to take a look?” I ask. “My guest, she is in our country for the first time.”

“As long as you don't get too close,” he says, then drops his voice to a whisper: “And if you take Glory to the Revolution Pedestrian Overpass across to where the municipal district is, they're giving out Naturafish. Special token. Get one for your lady.”

I'm about to protest that I don't have a special token, I'm not from a well placed family, when I feel his hand touch mine and a token pressed into it “Thank you,” I whisper.

“Remember something. Life is beautiful, and it's a perfect day for Naturafish.”

I thank him again clandestinely and we head toward a hill from which we can see a bend in Potomskaya Street, and the foreign delegation being welcomed. The street is lined with people waving flags.

“So many people,” you say.

“Yes, to make a good impression. But they're not normal people. They're actors from the state acting academies. They're playing real people. Look—” I point, and you put your hand above your eyes to block out the sun. “—there's the actor playing me. Do you see?”

“I think so, but he looks nothing like you,” you say.

“There's probably an actress playing you too. They're always on top of who's here and who isn't, and I'm sure the foreign delegation would be honoured to meet you, by which I mean the actress playing you.”

“What do you think I'll say?”

“That you are impressed by the economic development of the country, the cleanliness of its public spaces, and the increase of its agricultural output.”

You smile, and I smile too. “But I'm sure she'll be nowhere near as pretty as you,” I say.

We walk down the hill hand in hand and join another lineup. Ahead, holding a small radio to his ear, a bearded man calls out, “Sixty fourth minute and still nil-nil, but the Uruguayans are fouling our boys like animals. Brutal tactics. They couldn't cope with our speed otherwise. Oh, what's this? A red card for Uruguay's captain and a free kick to us at the edge of the penalty area. Could this be the breakthrough?”

“That's Platonov,” I explain. “He's something of a folk hero around here. He used to be a very good footballer, before his injury.”

“I didn't know there were any matches going on right now,” you say.

“There aren't. Our team has been banned from international competitions by the governing bodies."" You notice that the radio isn't emitting any sound. “Platonov merely pretends to listen to a real football broadcast, and relates to us what he pretends, and we follow along. Even the newspapers report on what he pretends. Today, it's our second group match of the World Cup. We're in a group with Uruguay, Cameroon and the Netherlands. And once this World Cup is over in a few weeks, Platonov will pretend another into existence, and so on, so there's always a World Cup going on. In some ways, it's better than the real thing. We don't always win. In fact, we haven't even made the final since February of last year.”

“Why does he do it?”

“For the love of sport and his fellow man.”

“Goooaaalll!” Platonov yells. “What a strike, straight into the upper left corner. Sanchez-Lobos didn't stand a chance. We're ahead. Twenty-two minutes left. Can we hang on? A win would set us up perfectly for the final matchday, but even a draw will do. Come on, boys! Come on!”

Everyone in the lineup cheers, including me and you, and you lean against my shoulder.

The lineups wriggle forward like snakes, crossing, merging, intertwining and forking, splitting apart, like veins across the city. The people in them talk and laugh and commiserate. “How are you?” “My husband's sick again.” “It could be worse: you could be sick.” “My children are hungry.” “Whose aren't?” “Can you hold my place in line?” “Yes, sure.” “I'm waiting on medical results.” “So you're healthy at least until then.” “My washing machine broke again.” “It was a Sovpral. It did you a favour.” “We've no hot water in our building.” “The electricity goes out every day after fourteen o'clock, but you can come over and boil some to bathe your baby.”

It's late afternoon by the time we locate the queue the police officer told me about. It's shorter than the others, as all special token queues are. You can tell the individuals in this lineup are more refined, less plain. These are people who have performed services for the motherland.

Around us, the municipal district looks upon us in all its concrete neoclassical grandeur.

“This is a really nice spot,” you say.

“Yes, it cost a lot of money to build. The city was supposed to be governed from here.”

“Supposed?”

“It's abandoned. The buildings are empty, mostly unfinished on the inside. The project was part of a five-year plan, but it wasn't completed in time. The fifth year rolled into a sixth, and the new five-year plan didn't want to finish up the last one's projects. Every five-year plan wants to be independent, its own thing, you know.”

For the first time I'm nervous, feeling the token in my pocket with sweating fingers. What if it's a set-up? The lineup moves quickly, and soon we are the front, in one of the unfinished buildings. Two women, both dressed in grey, sit behind a counter. One holds out her hand as the other says, “Token, please.”

I hand it over.

“Is it true this is the lineup for Naturafish?” I ask.

“Yes,” says the first, handing me a small unmarked tin. I can almost smell what it contains. My eyes fill with tears, but I don't allow myself to cry. Mom and dad, sister, grandma and grandpa will be so pleasantly surprised. “Thank you,” I say, already pulling you by the hand and shuffling to the side so the next person in line may get their tin.

We take our time walking back.

It's already evening.

“What's Naturafish?” you ask softly, still holding my hand. It's a lovely feeling.

“It's a synthetic form of tuna manufactured from soybeans we receive from Brazil under the beneficial terms of our trade agreement.” Because I can see your smile wilt, “It's considered better than the real thing,” I add. “Better tasting, better for the environment, more nutritious and a domestically-made product on top of that. It's something of a point of pride for us, a symbol of what we're capable of as a state.”

We arrive back at the apartment just in time for dinner, which mom is preparing.

She did not succeed in getting any meat and did not want to camp out until morning, but dad managed two bars of soap and two batteries, sister got bread, and grandpa was able to get a bottle of milk but no butter. “Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow,” he says.

“Butter luck,” you say, and everyone laughs.

The electricity falters then fails, which means the lights suddenly go out, but we have candles. I light them and arrange them across the unit.

The flames flicker in the breeze.

The light is warm.

“I wasn't in the mood for butter anyway,” says dad.

“Me neither,” adds sister.

At the end of the meal, I take out the tin of Naturafish and lay it on the table.

“Is it…”

“Yes,” I say.

In that moment, as I let grandpa open the tin, revealing the flakes of Naturafish inside, I know what you must be thinking. That it's a small tin. In your country, you would probably have one tin per person, and I wonder if you can ever truly understand what life is like here. But then mom passes out the dessert forks that dad and I made  from scrap metal years ago. And as we take turns tasting the Naturafish, talking, laughing, sharing the experiences of our days, I believe you can and do, and it fills me with the greatest joy.

“Does anyone happen to know if we won the match today?” dad asks.

“We were up 1-0 in the sixty-eighth minute,” you say.

“Dirty Uruguayans,” says grandma.

“I'm sure it'll be in the newspaper tomorrow.”

“Does anyone want coffee?”

“I do.”

“Me too.”

“But we've ve nothing to heat the water with,” I say, pointing at the candles.

Grandpa gets up from his chair, crosses to the window and looks out. “It seems they have power a few buildings down. I know a man who lives there, Ivan. I'll get some hot water from him and bring it back.”

“It's really no big deal. You don't have to,” you say.

“Don't be ridiculous,” says grandpa in that way we have of accepting gratitude by being mock aggressive. It means he likes you. 

I like you too.

I may not have much, but what I have I want to share with you. The sun sets. Grandpa returns. The water's no longer hot. Grandpa spent time talking to Ivan, whose daughter is getting married soon. But it's warm, and warm is good enough. Maybe not for real coffee, but for roasted barley and chicory it is, and that's all we have, and we're grateful for that, talking and laughing until bedtime.",2,1758055557.0,Wholesomenosleep,1,1.0,False

DC commentary:
>! Not sure if it was the beers last night at the work function but I couldn’t get my heart rate into the orange zone today. I did have to ask the coffee crew if this was a sufficiently challenging template as my heart rate zones felt quite a bit off. They did assure me that this is a fairly challenging template! It is an ESP today so you will get blocks for endurance, strength and power in that order. \
\
On the treads you start with endurance - 2 minutes of push into a minute of active recovery at base. Repeat this twice more to complete the block. \
\
Next block is strength and you are alternating between a minute base at incline and a minute base at flat road. The inclines start at 3% and climb to 6% by the end of the block. \
\
Last block was the easiest - just four 30 second all outs with a minute to walk in between. I didn’t think today was that bad but I was told by others it was pretty tough. I ended up with 5.57km (3.461 miles) in the tread block. \
\
Over by the floor, each of the blocks start with a row buy-in. On the first block this is a 40 stroke base row. After this you are over by the floor for tap squats with an active recovery of a shoulder press using the mini bands over your wrists. It did feel like this was over pretty quick and I only got maybe three rounds of this in before time was called. \
\
Next block was strength and we had a chest press paired with another recovery exercise of a deadlift to low row. In this one our coach said we could add a light weight to get a bit more resistance but the screen does show this with just the mini bands around the forearms / wrists. The row buy-in this time is only 20 strokes at a slower stroke rate where the goal was to get to half of what you did in block 1. \
\
Last block has a shorter row buy-in again - only 10 strokes. The power moves picked for this block is the single arm snatch paired with a low band crunch hold with scissors. Repeat this until the finisher of more snatches. Again, this felt pretty short and I only got a couple of rounds in before the finisher. \
\
I didn’t think today was too bad but everyone else thought it was pretty tough. I would have given it a 3 but I was told it should definitely be a 2 (🪶 🪶) out of 5 for gentleness so I have gone with that. !<

1nit7e9,https://i.redd.it/spfk1rqa9lpf1.jpeg,Un-Home,"A photo by alirezaskndari Unsplash 

A rainy childhood. A heavy jacket. Memories that never fade. 


The school bell tolled, signaling the end of another day. My classmates spilled into the corridor, their laughter echoing like wind through the halls. One voice rang above the rest—“Finally, no more watering plants!” They rejoiced at the rain that had spared them a chore. But where they found relief, I felt dread settle heavier on my chest. For me, rain had never brought freedom. It had always been a curse.

By the time I had walked home, my uniform was drenched, clinging coldly to my thin frame. I shivered through the day, goosebumps prickling my skin.

At home, I peeled off the wet clothes and hung them over the curtains—the only substitute for a hanger. From the plastic bag that kept my few “special” belongings—my vest, my uniform—I pulled the same mud-stained clothes back onto my body. I then slipped on the old grey wool jacket, once belonging to a sibling, carrying the weight and smell of years. Its wool was loose, riddled with holes, its smell sharp and sour. Wearing it made me feel unclean, as if the fabric itself were rejecting me.

In that dusty little room, the roof leaked like a sieve. Raindrops slipped through the tin, pattering onto the floor beside me. The air smelled of wet earth, smoke, and the sour wool jacket clinging to my skin. I sat trembling, tears sliding down my cheeks, as I wondered why life had been so cruel. Outside, others lay warm in their rooms, the glow of comfort spilling from windows I could not reach.

For a moment, I gathered what little strength I had left and stepped into the mud. The rain soaked me again and again as I struggled to find wood—pieces scattered, slick with water, heavy and awkward in my arms. Each trip back left me exhausted, clothes dirtied further, the jacket sticking to me, pressing its history into my back.

Back in the shack, the roof leaked steadily, drops of water falling into the corners like reminders that even shelter could not protect me. I crouched over the damp sticks, coaxing sparks into life. Hours passed, sparks dying before they could catch, smoke choking my lungs. I cried above that stubborn heap, my chest aching with the weight of the rain, the wood, the mud, and the leaking shack pressing into me.

Then the summons came, sharp and merciless: “When will the food be ready? We are hungry!” Louder still: “My husband is hungry!” There was no reprieve. Chores piled like punishments—water to fetch, dishes to scrub, food to prepare. By nightfall, when I glimpsed my reflection, the face staring back was that of a stranger: dirty, worn, hollow-eyed.

College had been my deliverance. The first time I saw its bright lights flickering in the distance from the taxi window, they shone like a beacon of hope. The farm breeze carried a freshness I had never known. When I opened the door to my small room, the white walls glowed as if newly painted, the air crisp and clean. I unpacked my few belongings into the wardrobe, stood before the shining bathroom mirror, and for the first time in my life, I felt I had stepped into heaven—a true home.

There, with the help of a bursary, I bought food, clothes, and toiletries of my own—luxuries once beyond reach. No more sharing lotion until bottles ran dry, no more brittle hair breaking between my fingers. My body, at last, was mine to care for.

Some people hadn’t understood; they said I didn’t like home, but they didn’t realize that not every home shelters, not every place comforts. The fear had been constant: I hadn’t wanted anyone to know my past, to call me by a name I didn’t like. Even those before me, who had worn the same jackets and walked the same muddy paths, had tasted a little of what college offered. It did not erase the scars of our past, but it offered a glimpse of what life could be—a brief reprieve, a healing breath.

But as the holidays approached, that reprieve threatened to unravel. The bright halls and clean air of college could not shield me from the memories creeping back, whispering the dread of home. Happiness felt fragile, and sometimes the weight pressed so hard that I wondered if I could survive it. Thoughts of giving up flickered in my mind, but the uncertainty of what came after—whether life beyond would be kinder or harsher—held me back. The place I had longed to forget was calling me back, and the weight of it pressed heavier with each passing day.

And yet, the memories cling. Even now, I wonder: why do I still feel the weight of those woods on my shoulders, as if I am forever carrying them through the rain? Why does the thought of that town, that place, those people, still ache in my chest?

I want to forgive. I want to forget. But the past lingers like smoke in my lungs, refusing to let me breathe freely.

1nit72u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nit72u,New indoor fry tank setup!,"Hello! 
I wanted to show you my new indoor fry tank I setup recently for my fry that won't stay outside for the winter and are too small for my community aquariums. 

As you can see on the second picture, I have a small and cheap reusable coffee filter, with an airline tubing ring to make it float, for the eggs that are about to hatch. I keep the eggs in tap water in a separate container for the most part, but move them there when I believe they'll hatch very soon. 

When they hatch, the fry are ""stuck"" in the coffee filter so I can move them to the white mesh box where they are safe from bigger fry and ""strong"" current. It's also easier to feed them in a smaller space like this.

The rest of the tank is for bigger / older fry before they get big enough to be transferred to one of my aquariums. 

I run a tiny sponge filter and a heater that I keep at ~ 25°C / 77°f. I feed them paramecium that I prepared in advance and Hikari first bite. I cycled the tank before adding any fish. There's also a few snails in there to deal with leftover food.

I'm hoping to have more success than with my previous set up in a bowl that was much smaller, without heater and water movement, where I lost quite a lot of fry. At the time I also wasn't feeding paramecium. ",5,1758055375.0,medaka,0,0.86,False

There are lots of things I really like about DC but feel like now is the time in my life to explore somewhere new. These are the things I am looking for in a new spot:

- Somewhere with a decent dating scene for a girl in their late 20’s  
- Walkability is very important to me but it doesn’t have to be an entirely walkable city - just have an area I could live in and walk to get to some little stores/coffee shops, has sidewalks, and is just not entirely car dependent. 
- I also love a city that is very bike-able and has bike lanes that feel safe (not a must though)
- Somewhere with good access to outdoor activities; ideally near mountains or a body of water that is useable (unlike the Potomac) 
- Has a good music scene with popular artists coming regularly
- Good food/ bar scene, no cuisine type in specific but just a decent amount of high quality, trendy restaurants 
- Has all 4 seasons and more sunny days than cloudy ones (not in the south)
- An hour or less to an airport where I won’t have to take a connecting flight everywhere I go
- Good farmers markets, running routes, workout classes, boutiques, and markets are also all bonuses 

For these purposes cost of living is not a factor!

He just ""does this sort of thing"" He apologized and they still continued to hangout despite my feelings.

She has talked about how this guy has a lot of money, a nice car and is super smart. This made me feel jealous and I told her why I felt uneasy about this guy and him asking if she wanted to go to Europe with him. She told me not to worry and that she has said to him that they are just friends. Fast forward a few weeks later. I came home from work and she was very upset, I asked her why, she told me that he found out they we are dating (I guess she never mentioned to him that she was in a relationship) He got all quiet and didn't say anything. The next day he confessed his feelings for her and she rejected him, telling him that she is in a committed relationship and that they wouldn't work out. She thought she had made herself clear that they were just friends, this guy had said that she was giving him ""signals"" but she didn't think so. They both talked about it like adults and want to remain friends and he told her that ""he's not in it for the long game""

When she told me about this, i got upset, I told her how I don't like how she talks about him, his money, car and intelligence. She said ""if you are jealous than do better than him"" This I took as an insult basically saying that I am not good enough and I should watch out for this guy. She then told me about there is nothing going on between them, they are just friends and that she isn't going anywhere and wouldn't do anything with him. I asked her if her feelings towards him are just platonic and nothing more. She told me that she likes him as a person and that they have some things in common; but again, she does not see her in a relationship with him. 

I had asked what boundaries are put in place with this guy, she said ""just friends nothing more"" I stated that I don't feel comfortable about this guy and that he rubs me the wrong way & the fact that I have never met him. I had asked her if I could meet her friend and she told me ""no that might make things worse and it would be weird"" I said I am just uneasy about this being ""some mystery guy"" and I would appreciate if she would let me know when & where she is hanging out with him and when she would be back. She said i was being controlling and if I couldn't allow her to have guy friends then we shouldn't date if that's going to be a problem.

I had asked her if the roles were reversed and it was me hanging out with a ""mystery girl"" who I talked highly of, said she has things that my girlfriend doesn't (money/car, what have you)  and that this girl has feelings for me but I tell her that we are just friends and hangout all the time. How would that make her (my girlfriend) feel?   
She said ""yes I would feel uneasy and not comfortable about it"" I told her yes these are my concerns

A few take aways from all this  
\- I feel disrespected and i think she is hiding something from me  
\- She is humoring a guy that likes her  
\- Continues to do stuff with him, while knowing that I am not a fan of it  
\- She says I'm being controlling yet doesn't want me to meet her guy friend  
\- Essentially told me that if I am jealous of him, then i should ""be better than him""

I trust that she would never put herself in a position to ""fuck up"" (cheat on me) but this still makes me uneasy.  Just don't know what to do at this point, I feel disrespected, not taken seriously and lied too. I am too afraid of bringing this up with her because she will get upset and say I am controlling her friendships but this is eating me away and I cannot take it anymore. I love her and I don't want to end things because ""I can't handle her having guy friends"" I just want 100% honesty and trust from her.",3,1758055251.0,relationship_advice,18,0.81,False

Understanding Dental Hygiene Basics

Daily Oral Care Routine
Establishing a robust daily dental care routine is the foundation of excellent oral health. Here are the key components:

• Brushing: Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste
• Flossing: Clean between teeth at least once daily
• Mouthwash: Use an antiseptic rinse to kill bacteria

According to the American Dental Association, only 30% of people floss daily, which means most individuals are missing crucial oral hygiene steps.

Toothpaste and Mouthwash Considerations

• Sensitive teeth: Desensitizing toothpaste

Trying to dress up as a realistic mummy for Halloween, and want to dye bandages to give them an aged look.  I want it to look splotchy, dirty, and inconsistent, so I was thinking I could use coffee grounds and black tea to dye them before distressing them. 

I'm planning on using Band Aid Brand Medical Gauze and am going to sew this gauze as a base layer around leggings and a top, once dyed.  The fabric is made from a Rayon / Polyester blend - that's it.  Not percentages or anything. 

I also attached a picture of what I'm going for.  The woman in the video used coffee and those bandages, but I feel her bandages are really monochromatic.  Since I'm going to have my legs and arms and face entirely covered, I'd like to have a little more variety in the coloring.  Any ideas or tips would be helpful!  Thank you!

The dead kept no schedule, and she had been stuck catching snippets of sleep whenever she could. A catnap here and a stolen twenty minutes there did little to help her keep a sense of time. 

Now it was black outside, starless, and her uncle's cabin was supposed to be somewhere out in these woods but it was black too, no candle in the window to guide her. The city was far behind her - as far as she could get on foot and lugging a fanny pack full of half-thought-out supplies, at least. A camping water filter and a bottle, but no cap; an impulse-buy flare gun that had sat uselessly in her junk drawer for four years but no flashlight. At least the old GPS unit worked, though the batteries were fading. These coordinates were roughly where the cabin should be, give or take a few hundred feet. She was not the least prepared zombie apocalypse survivor, but she certainly wasn't the most. That had been uncle Wally's department. She absolutely had to find that cabin. 

The trails she had followed in daylight had been clear of the undead for a while. She toyed with the idea of setting camp and starting again tomorrow. But what if she were ambushed as she slept, torn apart by a stray corpse just a hundred feet from the safety of the cabin?  But she couldn't continue on blind. She was just as likely to walk right past the damn thing and be none the wiser. She toyed with the cat-shaped brass knuckle keychain she had pulled off of her apartment keys. The GPS' screen barely even glowed, a sluggish off white in the darkness.

There was *one* source of light available to her. 

And it had been days since she last saw a zombie, let alone another person. She could fire the flare, dash for the cabin, and voila - safety. Uncle Wally would probably have stocked coffee and maybe even a few beers. As long as she moved fast, she could be inside in seconds. 

She slowly, by infinitesimal degrees, unzipped the fanny pack. Every minute pop of the teeth coming apart set her heart jumping, but nothing burst from the darkness to get her. She lifted the flare pistol, took a deep, bracing breath, and fired it straight up into the air. 

It lasted much longer than she would have expected. It was easy to spot the cabin, its recently burned remains still even letting off smoke in the apocalyptic red light. The dead surrounding the cabin's corpse turned, thirty, fifty of them, standing on the site of what she now realized had been Wally's last stand, and crashed through the underbrush. By the time they were on her, the flare hadn't even started to fall. ",14,1758054908.0,shortscarystories,3,1.0,False

1niswvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExploreComputers/comments/1niswvf/reveal_how_the_lenovo_ideapad_slim_3_chromebook/,Reveal How the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook Stacks Up in Daily Use,"Testing the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook over several weeks made me reevaluate what I consider an essential, everyday laptop. The sleek form and lightweight design of this Chromebook drew me in from the start. With a 14-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen, it combines clarity with vibrant color reproduction that effortlessly handled everything from work emails to late-night Netflix binges. What struck me most was how compact and slim it was—tossing it in my bag for a coffee shop work session felt effortless. This design is clearly aimed at people who want portability without skimping on essential performance.

**Performance That Surprises**  
Using this Chromebook, equipped with the trusty MediaTek Kompanio 520 processor, I found it to be powerful enough for everyday tasks. The balance of performance and energy efficiency meant there was no overheating during extended work sessions. Multitasking, such as switching between Word documents, Chrome tabs, and YouTube, remained smooth, thanks to the 4GB LPDDR4X RAM. The processor didn’t lag when editing Google Sheets or even running lightweight web applications, proving to be an excellent option for students or professionals who need reliable performance on a budget.  

[See Lenovo IdeaPad price on Amazon.](https://mymypc.com/p/b0dgd1699v/)  

**Storage: Convenience in Abundance**  
Storage was unexpectedly generous. The combination of 64GB eMMC flash storage and a bonus 160GB from the docking station set felt like a pleasant surprise. I could store files, work presentations, and personal multimedia without constantly having to worry about running out of space. This generous storage inclusion is especially appealing for professionals in creative fields or students storing coursework. The additional accessories, including a MicroSD card with an adapter and Type-C cables, were a thoughtful touch I didn’t know I needed until I started using them.

**Impressive Display and Touch Features**  
I didn’t expect a touchscreen to be this good on a laptop in this price range. The anti-glare coating works like a charm, even when I worked outdoors or near sunny windows. Using the touchscreen feels smooth and responsive—pinch and zoom actions are surprisingly precise, and navigation through ChromeOS becomes a breeze. Watching videos or scrolling through images showed off the sharpness and vividness of the integrated MediaTek graphics.

**Connectivity Options**  
The inclusion of WiFi 6 enables stellar internet speeds, with minimal lag, even during high-traffic hours. Bluetooth 5.1 makes pairing earbuds and other accessories effortless. The port selection—USB-C and USB-A slots, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack—covered nearly all my connectivity needs. I also appreciated the Kensington lock slot, something often missed in laptops marketed toward casual users.  

**Winning Points**  
- Lightweight and portable design, perfect for on-the-go individuals.  
- Highly responsive multi-touch anti-glare display.  
- Exceptional storage options with bonus docking accessories.  
- WiFi 6 ensures uninterrupted streaming and online gaming.  

**Hurdles to Watch Out For**  
While the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook met most of my expectations, there were some areas that left room for improvement:  
- The lack of upgrade options for RAM felt limiting, especially as applications grow more resource-intensive.  
- Although the MediaTek processor handles casual multitasking, it isn’t meant for heavier tasks like video editing or gaming.  
- ChromeOS, while beginner-friendly, might trouble users accustomed to full-fledged operating systems like Windows.

**Product Comparisons**  
Looking at similar models like HP Chromebook 14 or Acer Chromebook Spin, the Lenovo IdeaPad stands out for its price-to-performance ratio. While HP offers competitive display quality, Lenovo edges ahead with its docking accessories, adding more storage and functionality. Acer Spin, on the other hand, focuses on 360-degree hinge versatility, which is better for a tablet-like experience. However, for straightforward productivity tasks and enhanced portability, Lenovo remains my top pick. Its sharp display and included bonuses are hard to beat in this segment.

**Worth Every Penny**  
Factoring in all the features, it’s easy to see why this product feels like a solid investment for casual users. Budget-friendly Chromebooks often skimp on either screen quality or expandability, but the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 manages to strike a balance without shooting up the price. The added value from docking accessories further drives home its appeal, especially for students and professionals who want more storage without adding to the clutter.

Anyway this is about the time I got yelled at for honking my car horn at a person in the drive thru of a busy coffee shop.  The woman ahead of me was engrossed in her phone call.  So engrossed she didn't notice as the cars in front of her moved up, ordered and moved on to pick-up and pay.

I waited until it was her turn to order, with the line growing behind me, before I tapped my horn as lightly and quickly as I could.  My intent was to get her to look up.  I expected she would realize there  were no cars in front of her at all, she's four car lengths from the order box and it's time for her to pull up and place an order.

Instead she put her car in park, got out and came back to me screaming at me that I had no right to honk at her and it is not illegal to be on your cell phone in a drive thru.

I responded that I don't give a fuck, either place an order or get the fuck out of the way because I (waves at the line of cars and drivers staring at her) and the rest of us just want to get a fucking cup of coffee.

I am a morning person; I wake up full of energy, and I like to play upbeat, cheerful music while I make coffee and get ready for my day. It puts me in a great mood. My partner is the complete opposite. He is not a morning person at all and prefers to wake up slowly in complete silence.

This morning, I was playing my usual playlist, nothing crazy loud, just at a reasonable volume, and he came into the kitchen looking really irritated. He asked me to turn it off, saying the music was “grating” and giving him a headache before he’d even had his coffee. I laughed it off and said it would help him wake up, and I kept it on.

He got really upset then, saying that I was being incredibly disrespectful of his needs and that I always prioritize my own routine over his comfort. He told me I was selfish and that using headphones in the morning is a simple compromise that I refuse to make.

I think he’s overreacting. It’s my home too, and I should be allowed to enjoy my morning how I want. I don’t ask him to change his habits for me. He’s been giving me the silent treatment all morning, and I’m starting to wonder if I was an asshole for not just turning the music off",2,1758054459.0,AmIOverreacting,604,0.5,False

His girl Friday was Dora Miles, played by the lovely Nita Talbot. Even though Mike was the boss, Dora had a lot of clout in the newsroom.

Here are the ones people miss most often,"I built an app called [**Deduct AI**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deduct-ai/id6744041920) to help solopreneurs, freelancers, and gig workers save thousands by identify their purchases that can be written off. So far, I’ve helped builders uncover over $100k in deductions and here are some of the more interesting expenses I found out could be written off from the app:

**1. App Store / Play Store developer fees:** The IRS considers both store fees as business operating expenses.

**2. GitHub Copilot and AI tools (ChatGPT, Midjourney, etc.)**: If you use them for coding, content, or product design, they count as software subscriptions necessary for business.

**3. Coffee shop work sessions**: If you are working out of Starbucks and buy coffee to “rent a seat,” that spend is deductible as a business workspace expense.

**4. Part of your home internet and phone bill**: If 50 percent of your usage is for business (client calls, product testing, development work), then 50 percent of that bill can be written off.

**5. Online courses and books**: Anything that improves your skills such as programming, marketing, sales, or entrepreneurship qualifies as continuing education.

**6. SaaS tools**: Notion, Figma, Linear, Slack, Zoom, Supabase, AWS. All ordinary and necessary business tools.

**7. Travel to conferences and meetups**: Flight, hotel, Uber, and meals during a business trip are deductible. Even local meetups (rides and meals) count as networking expenses.

**8. Marketing and ads**: Spending on TikTok ads, Facebook ads, or hiring UGC creators counts as business marketing costs.

**9. Workspace setup**: Laptop, monitor, ergonomic chair, and standing desk. Even part of your rent or mortgage if you use a home office.

**10. Contractor costs**: Hiring a freelance designer, developer, or video editor is fully deductible as contractor services.

You can also deduct health insurance premiums, payment processing fees, coworking space memberships, and much more.

As a solopreneur, you are more than likely overpaying in taxes. On average, you could save **$3,000 or more per year if you know what you can actually track and are tracking your expenses throughout the year**. That is why I built [an app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deduct-ai/id6744041920) that scans your bank transactions and receipts to identify and track hidden deductions.

Well there was no need to imagine, as that’s exactly what I was doing just a few days ago. But what you CAN imagine, devils dogs, is my surprise when I saw, with my own two mean, green eyes, and I shit you not, a UPS delivery man wearing USMC issued MARPAT trousers and his standard issue UPS work shirt. Never in my life as a dedicated administrative services specialist have I ever seen such a heinous display. I made my way to my forward hatch expeditiously and made it known to the motivator that it would behoove of him to remove those trousers at once. Now, I know most of you know the correct response would have been aye Cpl or sum shit, but this malingerer looks at me with the most lCpl esque expression I ever saw in my faithful 2 years of service, (I was administratively separated for having too large of a penis obviously). and just drove off.

1niso5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/evcharging/comments/1niso5d/lvl_1_charger_causing_discoloration_to_outlet/,Lvl 1 Charger causing discoloration to outlet,"Hi everyone. I have a Godiag Level 1+2 16Amp charger plugged into a wall plug that is GFCI protected from a different GFCI plug on the same circuit (this is an assumption as the GFCI will trip on a plug on a different wall and the plug that the charger is plugged into also goes out). This charger is one of those that has a NEMA 5-15 adapter that you plug into to be able to plug into a normal wall charger. I went to unplug it to move to a different outlet and noticed browning (not black, not super dark, a little coffee colored) on the outlet itself. The charger plug/prongs looks fine and not melted. Theres a bit of a rust looking residue on one of the prongs though. I have a newer house built in 2018 and the plug goes into the outlet snug without play or gaps. My obvious worry is that it is a fire hazard. There doesn't seem to be any damage or short circuit as the charger runs fine and everything else plugged in works fine, and the GFCI trips as needed.

I run the charger probably everyday for hours (we charge 2 cars that pretty much is plugged in when parked in the garage) at 16amps for the 1.5 years i had it. My hunch is that the 16amps may be too much for the outlet and causing too much heat, just enough to discolor the outlet. Again never smelled burning and nothing smoking or no sparks when plugging it in.

I have a 12amp Kia Level 1 charger that looks to have a better built wall plug. Honestly just looks much better built all around than the Godiag. Would it be sufficient to plug this in and see if it gets as hot, if it stays coolor, would it be safe to just run the slower charger? Or should I get an electrician to replace the outlets?  Am I correct in assuming that the 16Amp (probably cheaply made) charger is causing the heating issue at the plug? Does anyone know the normal amps these house outlets allow?

I recently built an app called *Caffeine Tracker (Kafi)* to better manage my coffee habits, and thought some of you might find it useful too.

  
**Key features:**

* Visualize your caffeine intake with daily, weekly, and hourly charts.
* See how caffeine metabolizes in your body and how much will remain by bedtime.
* Built-in database for popular drinks (Starbucks, Costa, etc.) + option to add your own custom drinks.
* Apple Health integration to connect caffeine intake with sleep and wellbeing.

You can try the app for free, and I’m giving away **premium access to anyone interested**.

Would love to hear your feedback and suggestions — what works, what could be better! 😊

Narcissa Rae Scofield, the love product between a German Shepherd and a Siberian Husky, cloaks herself in the hues of autumn. This pure soul is looking forward to the season that she enjoys the most, in preparation for a new chapter of her life within the confines of the metropolis of unbridled hedonism, Nascent City. Thus, with a cup of specialty coffee carrying a delightful bouquet of aromas and donning her favorite turtleneck sweater, Narcissa is set to begin her day appropriately.

However, unbeknownst to her, the chilly morning is obfuscating an otherwise sunny and warm day, very much opposed to the idealized ""sweater weather"" the naive young woman hopes for.

Curious that my influence seems not to touch her. Is it suppression of desire? Denial? I must look closer.

1nislfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCRawData/comments/1nislfz/reveal_how_the_khanka_logitech_k780_keyboard_case/,Reveal How the Khanka Logitech K780 Keyboard Case Stacks Up,"The Khanka K780 Case recently made its way into my daily routine, and I’ve genuinely enjoyed putting it to the test. Designed specifically for the Logitech K780 Multi-Device Wireless Keyboard, it’s marketed as a durable and lightweight protective solution with several thoughtful features. The description alone caught my attention, but as someone who lugs their tech gear around constantly, I wanted to see if this case was as practical as the claims suggest.

**Design and Build Quality**  
From the very first glance, the aesthetic design is both sleek and functional. The black hard shell with its vibrant yellow zipper strikes a balance between professional and eye-catching. It’s not just about looks, though—the EVA material feels robust and was a big selling point for me. I deliberately tossed it into a bag with other gadgets, and it resisted scratches like a champ. Inside, the high-quality velvet layers are incredibly soft, giving the keyboard a snug and secure resting place. There’s even a mesh side compartment for storing small accessories, which I found perfect for cables or a USB receiver.

[Check Khanka K780 price on Amazon.](https://pasprog.com/p/b07txcz3z7/)  

**Ease of Use and Practicality**  
Thanks to the classic zipper design, accessing the keyboard is as simple as it gets. My work setup bounces between home and office, and the case makes the transition smooth. Just unzip, grab the keyboard, and you’re ready to go. The lightweight design ensures it’s not bulky to carry in a laptop bag or backpack. Because I can be a bit careless at times, knowing that the case offers dustproof and waterproof properties adds peace of mind. I accidentally left it next to my coffee cup the other day, and while there were no spills, it gave me confidence that the case was built for small emergencies.

**Protection Features**  
This case isn’t just about looking good. Its shockproof, dustproof, and waterproof properties prove incredibly effective. Whether it’s minor accidental bumps or the occasional splash, the EVA material seems to handle it all. Also, I realized something over time—keeping my keyboard in the case when not in use significantly reduced dust accumulation, a huge plus for anyone who leaves their gadgets out and exposed. I can already see how this case will extend the life of my Logitech K780.

**Good Points**  
- High-quality EVA material ensures protection against shocks and splashes.  
- Lightweight and portable design makes it easy to carry.  
- The soft velvet lining prevents scratches and keeps the keyboard secure.  
- Handy mesh compartment for storing accessories like cables or dongles.

**Bad Points**  
- Does not accommodate larger accessories or a full-sized mouse.  
- Limited compatibility; it’s designed only for the Logitech K780 keyboard.  
- The bright yellow zipper looks stylish but may not appeal to those wanting an all-black, minimal design.  

**Competing Products**  
There are certainly a couple of alternatives for protecting your peripherals. For example, I briefly considered the CASEMATIX Hard Shell Keyboard Case, which includes customizable foam inserts and feels a tad roomier. While great, it doesn’t have the elegant zipper design or the mesh compartment offered by the Khanka K780 Case. Another option, the co2CREA Hard Case, offers a comparable build but lacks the softer velvet lining, which I’ve grown to appreciate. The stand-out difference for me is how tailored the Khanka feels for its designated keyboard model. It screams ""custom fit,"" whereas others settle for the “one-size-fits-all” approach.

**Value for Money**  
We all know pricing can fluctuate, and I didn’t have the exact number in hand, but based on its features and performance, this case offers excellent value. Between the premium materials, protective qualities, and lightweight design, it feels like a solid investment for anyone wanting to keep their keyboard mobile and safe. While it might seem like an indulgence for casual users, professionals who frequently travel or switch workspaces will really appreciate the durability and ease. It’s not the cheapest option, but its quality for the price is undeniable.

So for important background information, my partner and I have been together basically 2 almost years. I caught my partner  “cheating” twice. I put it in quotations because he didn’t do any physical cheating. The first time I caught him, he had been texting with an old best friend. When I found out, I messaged the woman directly and what she said was: She opened her relationship before she decided to get married and basically said that she would send nudes to my boyfriend whenever she got bored or didn’t have a current partner of her own. She said that she never intended to have sex with him, but it was just something flirty and fun and she had no idea he was in a relationship. On top of that there was porn absolutely everywhere in his phone. Every search in his Safari was porn, he was also on Reddit pages looking at other stuff as well. When I found out, and confronted him he broke down to me and said that he has a porn addiction and this constant need for validation he didn’t feel that he was getting with me. We had moved in together about three months previous and he said that in that time he lost his job, I was the breadwinner, and I was constantly getting on him when he was depressed and that we had been so up and down and fighting and it was “just something fun.” I found out months later that when I was fighting with him and his friend lost interest, he did download Tinder but deleted it the next day.

Because of his breakdown, I felt guilty leaving and I agreed to try and make it work. We went to one therapy session and then started acting like nothing happened.. and then 4 months ago he came home drunk. One of our neighbours helped him into the house and came up to the bedroom to tell me that he was really intoxicated. I came down, helped him get onto the couch and went outside to smoke with the neighbor. He gave me his keys and his phone. I had been feeling off and so I decided to go through his phone. At first, it seemed all clear, but mostly just that he got better at hiding things. He hadn’t used his browser in months. He was using his private browser for everything. I found old videos of him having sex with his exes but again this is before we were together, but then I decided to look at his passwords and found a recent website he had been on fetlife. There he had posted pictures of his face and his penis, videos of him jerking off, there were messages from two weeks ago when I checked it just a “hey what are you doing tonight” and I was immediately filled with rage. We live together?? Were you gonna lie to me and go meet a stranger? 

He woke up the next morning, completely hung over. I had packed him a bag and told him to get out.  I said that enough was enough. On top of the fact that he couldn’t stay loyal to me no matter what I did, he had a clear, alcohol problem, and I was done with it. He begged and completed, but I told him that I had called his father and he was on his way to come get him. It was really difficult. About a month and a half by he would text me now again checking in, just basic conversation and then he asked me to go for coffee. I agreed. When we went, he explained to me that he had started taking medication to help him get off of the alcohol, he had been attending AA was two weeks sober. He told me that he didn’t even remember having his conversations and they were on nights that he had blacked out drunk and it wasn’t an excuse, but he just wanted me to know that it wasn’t anything that I was doing and he knew that there was something wrong with him. He had signed up for therapy, and asked if I would consider going to couples counselling and trying to make this work.. I told him that I needed some time so for about a month we got coffee together once a week and I finally agreed. We went to our first session where I told him that the point isn’t the problem. It’s the fact that he personalizes it. He goes on fetish websites and has conversations with real people, he doesn’t just look at porn. He goes on Reddit and comments on women posting on here. If it was just him going on porn hub, it wouldn’t bother me, but that’s not what it is. He has still been attending AA, goes to therapy once every two weeks, and we got a couples counselling once a week. He is really putting the effort in to change.

He came back into the house a three weeks ago, our first time having sex was absolutely exhilarating. It was so passionate, intense, full of emotions. The second time we hooked up, literally the next day, I found myself getting bored in the middle of it so I decided to try something new on a whim and we did anal for the first time again absolutely exhilarating and exciting. We then went to weeks without having sex. I would tell him that I was in the mood and it wouldn’t happen, either I fell asleep or he was doing something, and we just didn’t get to it. Last night was the first time we hooked up again and those two weeks and I spent the whole time being bored out of my mind. I noticed when I was giving him oral that he wasn’t getting fully hard maybe halfway and that just made me feel terrible and I remember how rockhard he used to get just simply seeing me naked in the beginning. When he finally did get fully hard, he just got me to ride him for about 10 minutes by the end of it my thighs were burning and I was so fucking bored. I was completely out of breath and just done, he topped me for about two minutes before I just told him that I was done and to stop. 

He didn’t even finish which again made me feel terrible about myself. We hadn’t had sex in weeks and he struggled to get hard and didn’t even cum. Even though I was bored, I still showed enthusiasm. When all of a sudden done, he told me “how great it was” and I just remember thinking to myself what bullshit that was. He went to take a shower and asked me to join and I said I’ll be right up. I heard the shower start and grabbed my vibrator. It only took me two minutes to get where I needed. And I just remember feeling so defeated. 

I’m bored , I’m hurt by my partner’s actions, something as simple as him taking a few minutes to get hard just gave me the ick and the whole time I just didn’t wanna be there anymore. What is going on?? we’ve done all this work and I feel really happy emotionally but sexually I’m not satisfied or happy. And before it’s a question, I don’t think about the other girls or what else he’s doing during those moments. I’m just bored at the same old routine. 69 you top me for a minute or two and then want me to ride you till you’re done. I miss the excitement feeling in the beginning. I miss the fun that we used to have. But even if he was to try the same thing that he did in the beginning with me now I don’t know that it would excite me either. 

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I see him making such an effort to do and be better, but I just feel like I stopped caring. Like I said I love him and care about him, but he comes home and it doesn’t make a difference in my day, I started going to bed without him rather than waiting because I’m tired of waiting for him all the time whether he’s talking to the neighbours or sitting out on his phone, I just stopped giving a shit.

1nisest,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1nisest/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_bunn_csb3t_and/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker BUNN CSB3T and Is It Worth It,"Using the BUNN CSB3T-B Speed Brew on a daily basis has been quite an experience. I’d heard of its reputation for brewing coffee faster than most home coffee makers, but testing it myself truly highlighted its efficiency. Within just four minutes, I was holding a pot of hot, aromatic coffee, and that convenience alone has changed my mornings. Unlike drip coffee makers that take their time preheating, this one relies on a stainless steel hot water tank that keeps 70 ounces of water brewing-ready 24/7. It’s convenient for someone like me, who prefers coffee on demand rather than waiting.

**Build Quality and Design Remarks**  
The first thing I noticed when unboxing it was the striking matte black finish paired with polished stainless steel accents, giving it a sleek and premium appearance. The size is moderate, sitting at about 8.3 inches deep and just under 15 inches high, which fits comfortably on a countertop without overtaking space. The removable thermal carafe is vacuum-insulated, ensuring warmth for hours. I even tested its claim by brewing a pot and leaving it on my desk—two hours later, the coffee tasted freshly brewed. The high-quality materials are evident in touch and feel, crafted for durability while maintaining aesthetic appeal.

**Ease of Functionality**  
Using this coffee maker couldn’t be simpler. The pour-in water bowl with a water level indicator makes it straightforward to measure exactly how much you need. Whether I’m brewing just 20 ounces for a travel mug or a full 50-ounce carafe, the process is consistent. Plus, having just one button to push keeps things beginner-friendly. My cousin, who isn’t exactly tech-savvy, managed to make herself a cup with no prior instruction.

[Check BUNN CSB3T-B price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b07gy6phyz/)  

**Brewing Quality and Temperature Levels**  
Taste is king when it comes to coffee makers, and I found that the BUNN system produces smoother, richer coffee than my previous machine. Its multi-stream spray head disperses hot water evenly over the grounds, maximizing flavor extraction. I experimented with a variety of coffee grounds, from finely ground breakfast blends to coarser dark roasts, and the results consistently impressed. Moreover, the water remains at an ideal 200°F, preventing over-burnt flavors common in cheaper models. The temperature consistency is one point I didn’t fully appreciate until I tried switching back to another coffee maker temporarily; the difference is striking.

**Winning Points**  
• Commercial-grade stainless steel tank ensures always-ready hot water.  
• Brews coffee fast—travel mug ready in 2 minutes, carafe done in 4 minutes.  
• Sleek design blends easily with modern kitchens.  

**Shortcomings**  
• The machine requires it to stay plugged in 24/7, resulting in constant power usage.  
• It cannot brew coffee using other methods like pods, catering specifically to ground coffee users.  
• Included thermal carafe doesn’t have a precise pour spout, causing occasional spills during the pouring process.  

**Product Comparisons**  
The BUNN Speed Brew stands apart when compared to options like the Technivorm Moccamaster or the Braun BrewSense. While the Moccamaster offers a similar café-quality taste, it doesn’t match BUNN’s speedy brewing time. On the flip side, Braun’s BrewSense is more budget-friendly but lacks the commercial-grade durability and optimized brewing temperature. Additionally, neither competitor offers the always-ready hot water availability, which I’ve grown to see as an unmatched convenience with the Speed Brew.

**Financial Value**  
Although the price point might feel steep to some at first glance, the consistent brewing speed, build quality, and café-like coffee flavor justify the investment. Many lesser-priced machines take longer or compromise on taste, making you spend more time or even lead you to replace them prematurely. I’d argue this model’s durability can save money in the long run, especially for heavy coffee drinkers like me.
