It’s like my tongue feels thicker and dry","I’ve only been on spiro for like 3 days and i feel like it makes my mouth feel weird? Almost like my tongue is thick and dry and harder to swallow. Maybe i’m just more aware of my tongue because my mouth is dry or something? I feel like i’m describing this so badly but i have anxiety and get worried my tongue/throat is swelling and i’ll have an allergic reaction coming. 

I am on 50mg but my doctor said after a week to bump up to 100 if i tolerate it well. It does make me a little dizzy so i’ve already been nervous to bump it up to 100 in a few days, so i’m worrying myself if i even should

I’ll be honest i am not the best with drinking water. I’m the type to get an iced coffee in the AM and ride that out for the day and maybe have a little water or juice later in the day. I’ve been trying to have more water since i started spiro but maybe it’s just not enough since i already sucked with it? 

My tongue doesn’t itch or tingle, it’s like it just feels bigger or something. But like i said i think it’s maybe just dry and giving the illusion of that? I don’t know and would like opinions lol

1i94kmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/196/comments/1i94kmz/what_does_it_mean_to_write_this_is_a_1800_word/,What does it mean to write? [This is a ~1800 word essay I wrote in an hour of rambling],"I certainly do like to consider myself a person who is, at least somewhat, educated. I can answer many a question – though mostly for history, English and Education. Nonetheless, I do consider myself well versed in many topics (by no means an expert beyond my fields of study), though a question I cannot seem to rattle and unriddle for myself is one that one of my favorite subjects of study, the famously “literally 1984” guy George Orwell, has once spent many a page to answer – why do I write?

Of course, for Orwell there was an entirely different ecology of literature present – social media was yet to be a thing, or mass media beyond the radio at all and the literature and artisan world of the world war era was an entirely different one, with revolutions and breaks in traditional narrative structures, traditional means and media, a cultural reinvention of literature and art as a whole. If you had told Orwell, that one day literature would be churned out by a complex algorithm instead of people with a heart of flesh and blood beating beneath their ribs, I do not believe he would have stayed sane – well, as sane as a man that wrote 1984 could possibly be.

And so, Orwells answer does not satisfy me. No wonder there, I am not Eric Arthur Blaire, also known as the world famous George Orwell, I am a nobody for the world of literature. I have no published book, my claim to fame is a student newspaper from half a decade ago. If anyone had likely no reason to contemplate the why, it would be me, yet the question drives me up at night, it keeps me awake and stubbornly remains unanswered. Why do I write? As this question drives me, I ask what drives this question into me in the first place, what it is that makes me think about this, what it is that makes me write about it. If every author is driven by something, what is it that drives me – if I do dare consider myself an author for matter of this question, and this question alone, as my writings wither on hard drives and a reddit profile that is of no concern to none. If I dare consider myself an author for a brief moment, it is my question what drives me?

What drives me to write, what drives me to publish and to try and hone my spotty and sporadic craft? Is it human to create, and if so, what does it mean to create?

 

As I read McCarthys Blood Meridian today, this question came to me again. What did the story of Blood Meridian speak to, that McCarthy sat down and decided to write down a story of a young man, a child, a teenager, whomever the kid may be, experiencing violence and tragedy and dying a gruesome death at the hands of a man that most would not dare dream a nightmare of and to put it to paper and put it to the people to read? What took a man to write this book, many of which consider one of the magni opi of US-American literature? Is it Death or is it Belief, is it personal or societal? The more I think about this question, the more I do not understand it – not because I do not see what McCarthy would have thought, what he could have deemed important enough to write it down and put it to text, no – because I do not understand what drove him. If Blood Meridian is about Death, the nature of mankind and war, the cancerous nature of violence spawning more violence, for we are all the travelers’ son Judge Holden had told the Glanton Gang about, is it that which drove McCarthy? Is it the abyss of humanity and the lack thereof, proven in the reverence of Holden for war, for where there is mankind there has always and will always been violence, from Ötzi, shot by another with bow and arrow long before any of us were even conceivably considered, or to the horrid pain and suffering we see each day; is it this abyss that kept McCarthy awake? Is it the nature of the wild and the savage that drives any man to this abyss that McCarthy has seen and decided to put to text? Is it the Judge, who’s so thoroughly in control of the narrative that he could be the author himself, aspiring to be an inevitable and unstoppable arbiter of fate and whatever destiny it may bring, be it Abrahamic, naturalistic or agnostic, be it of any kind of belief? I do not know.

And I will never know, never know for sure. Or do I already? Is it the same thing that drives me to think about these things, is it the same thing that drives me to write and to think and to construct narratives that also drove an Orwell and a McCarthy? Is it this feeling, the unrest in my heart that drove Orwell and that drove McCarthy?

In a way, I do believe so. In fact, being the depraved and deranged scholar of literature that I am, I once read a variety of Orwell-Essays, where he states as much – “One would never undertake such a thing if one were not driven on by some demon whom one can neither resist or understand. For all one knows that demon is simply the same instinct that makes a baby squall for attention”. Insofar, is it wrong to liken myself to Orwell and McCarthy, though I may never be known as such? Though I may never be known as one of the magni opi of literature, though my name will never be said with akin reverence to that of Orwell and McCarthy? Maybe. I sure feel it is, but yet it is this demon that Orwell describes that whips me on, feeds on my soul as I type this text in an unnamed Dokument1 on Word on an early evening, when other obligations should be demanding my time. The urge to be seen and the urge to know, the urge to write and the urge to create.

I may never know for sure what drove McCarthy, and I can only gleam so far into Orwell as he let into his essays, but yet I know this struggle and strife that Orwell talks about, and I believe to know it in McCarthy, for no sane man would undertake the extensive research and efforts that McCarthy undertook to write a book about bloodthirsty murderers of nigh-demonic lack of morality. But can this be the only thing?

If I were to follow Orwell, then no, for no thing can be unpolitical and no book can be good without the political soul of an author, yet I do not believe so. I have read prose that was purely for entertainment, yet had the unpolitical soul of its writer inherited from it. And I do not believe that the political soul has to be poured from the authors heart, as though it is true for both Orwell and I, as, whether I may dare consider myself a writer or not, my writing is no less political in nature than that which has cemented the reputation of Eric Arthur Blaire as the one and only George Orwell. No, I do not believe that McCarthy set out in the 80s to write a political novel with Blood Meridian, though it spoke something of his heart, something of his soul, though I do not know what it is. It oozes from every page like a spilled coffee does ooze from an unfortunate book that laid in its way.

And as such I must assume that Orwell is quite partially right, and a true writer has something that oozes form their soul and into the pages like spilled coffee. Something that must not be political, though all art is inherently political, but something that comes from whatever non-rational, demonic drive that keeps me up at night, that drove Orwell to write. For McCarthy I could at best speculate, and for Orwell he claims it is his spirit against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism that became his souls content which he poured to his works – but if such is the case, and I continue to indulge the nigh-heretic thought of likening myself to them, then what is my souls content? What drives me day in and day out to think on what to write, what drives me to sit down and type away at a keyboard a thousand words and four hundred more as of now, with the levels rising and rising and rising?

What is that I write about? I write about hope and about desolation, about the pain and about love, though I know some of these concepts distinctly better than the others. I write about the impending doom and the impeding resistance to it, about struggle and about strife. Is it this that fuels me? Or do I simply not know?

The more I write and the more I think about it, it drives me insane. I am a firm man of science, I believe that one day we will know all, one day we might be able to decipher the coding of the universe and our world and the stars of the sky, yet I do not know this about myself and my own urge to write and to create. Will I ever know? And do I even need to know. When I look at Orwells writing, I do not ask twice to find just the thing he said to pour into his work, for it oozes from every age, yet for McCarthy I am as riddled as for myself. His soul lives in every word, yet he seems as restless as I, yet his work seems to be about everything and nothing. I understand no more about what soul has driven McCarthy than I understand about myself, and maybe I will never, for neither. Maybe that is the demon that drives us, the desire to know what my soul is made of, and what my soul pours into my words.

And yet, at the end of more than a thousand and seven hundred more words I am left no smarter. I do see that my claim to rationality is waning at every turn and at every curve, asking questions I may never know the answer of and writing and writing on them as though a rambling lunatic took charge of me. As I set out with the first words, I set out to answer what it means to write in this day and this age, an age in which machines write for us and machines think for us, in which reading is the new epigraphical stone tablet, a nigh-forgotten craft, yet all I found is that I am yet to understand what it even means to write at all, for I have yet to find an answer that satisfies me, and the more I indulge it, the more I remain unanswered.",1,1737749079.0,196,1,1.0,False

However, I've been having A LOT of decaf and I can't help but notice that decaf that has been processed extensively (e.g. thermal shock, co-ferments) and roasted lightly - medium-light behaves more like regular coffee. In fact, certain coffee I had peaked at the 4 week mark which goes against everything we've been told about decaf...

I'm still finding that swiss water process decaf and darker washed EA decaf needs little to no resting. There's a certainly multiple factors in this beyond roast level and processing (e.g. type of roaster used)... Has anyone else had similar experiences? ",1,1737748548.0,thirdwavedecaf,0,1.0,False

I (31F) am ashamed to admit that the title is absolutely true. 8 months ago I adopted a puppy, I began to taker her on hikes, long walks at the park and other fun activities for puppies. Through all that I've met countless people, Sara (31F) and Mark (32M) being the ones I got along the most.

You have to understand my intentions were never to pursuit Sara, I never have or ever will go after someone that's already in a relationship, married or not.

At first I was genuinely happy that I got to make new friends that were around my age. Our pups get along well, and soon enough I exchanged numbers (with both of them) to arrange playdates. Due to conflicting working schedules a lot of the times Mark couldn't come, so I developed a deeper friendship bond with Sara.

I honestly don't know when it began, but I realized about 6 weeks ago. We were talking, laughing and suddenly we looked. At that very moment I just knew, and shame and regret quickly followed.

Like I said before, I will never pursuit someone that's in a relationship, so all I had to do now is choose if I wanted to remove myself completely from the situation or if was going to keep a healthy distance. I chose the later, because I didn't want to explain myself, I didn't want to confront them and explain why I had to remove myself. I'm not good with difficult conversations.

I tried to keep in touch, still making it to some of the playdates while keeping a distance while pretending everything was fine. I clearly did a really poor job, since 5 days ago Sara texted me saying she was worried and wanted to meet for coffee.

We met yesterday and I was a nervous wreck, I didn't want to have the conversation but a part of me was telling me that it was the right thing to do. I spent the whole day hyping myself up, and turns out I didn't need to.

Sara wasted no time telling me she had been worried sick, outright missing me and also wasting no time dropping an earth shattering bomb. She had realized she likes me.

I'm not gonna lie, at first I was happy. But Mark quickly came to mind and I felt even worse than before, double betrayal, from me and from Sara. I took a deep breath and told I was glad for her honesty, it was time for me to do the same. I told her I liked her too, and that was the reason I had keep a distance this past weeks. Before I could said anything else she interrupted me telling me she was over the moon, and started talking about dates, how excited she was about being with a woman, etc...

Even after her confession that's honestly the last thing I expected. I interrupted her myself and asked what she was talking about, if she was seriously talking about starting a relationship. She said ""Well, we could see where things take us"". I'm still perplexed, and I think at that moment I started seeing her in another light. I asked what about Mark then, would he agree? That was the first time I saw her face fall and she said he didn't have to know anything about ""us"" for now.

I decided at that moment that it was time to end the conversation, I told her in no uncertain terms that a relationship was never going to happen, and that I was frankly disappointed that she was considering cheating on her partner. Left quickly after that.

She has not contacted me since and I'm not planning on contacting her either. I've realized she is not the kind person I believed she was, and the more I think about it the more shitty I feel about the situation.

Now comes my dilemma, well, not really a dilemma but I don't know how to go about it. I want to tell Mark, from my point of view it's the right thing to do.

I know I haven't talked about him, but he is genuinely a good person. Always kind to everyone, always aware of others needs and willing to help anyone, even strangers. My friendship with him might not have been very deep, but I think highly of him and like being around him.

All of this is quite recent and all my feelings are a mess. I had to fight the urge to call him immediately, I want to have all my facts straight and when I'm nervous or upset I tend not to make much sense.

How would you guys go about this? Do text him? Call him? Ask him to meet up and not tell Sara about it? I really need help on how to manage this.",3,1737748547.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,0.8,False

The parking lot was riddled with potholes, the neon sign flickered like it might give up at any second, and the air smelled faintly of mildew. Marla, the front desk clerk, had worked there for years. She didn’t love it, but it paid the bills.

Every once in a while, someone would ask about Room 6. And every time, she’d give the same answer: “Out of order.”

Most people didn’t push. But then Colin showed up.

He looked like the kind of guy who’d been living off gas station coffee and adrenaline—messy hair, bags under his eyes, and a reporter’s notebook tucked under his arm. He leaned on the counter and said, “I heard this place has a haunted room.”

Marla sighed. “It’s not haunted. Just... not available.”

“Come on,” he said, flashing a crooked smile. “I’ll pay double.”

She stared at him, trying to decide if he was just another bored thrill-seeker or something worse. Eventually, she slid the key across the counter. “Your funeral,” she muttered.

Room 6 didn’t feel special when Colin stepped inside. The wallpaper was peeling, the bedspread looked like it hadn’t been replaced since the ’80s, and the smell of stale cigarettes hung in the air. He set up his camera on the dresser, flipped open his notebook, and waited.

The hours dragged. Midnight came and went. At one point, the heater kicked on with a loud rattle, making him jump. He laughed at himself and jotted it down anyway: Heater makes weird noises. Noted.

It wasn’t until 3:07 AM that something finally happened.

It started as a faint whisper, like someone talking in another room. Colin froze, straining to hear. The sound grew louder, but he couldn’t make out the words. It was like a radio tuning in and out.

“Hello?” he called. His voice sounded small in the empty room.

The whispers stopped.

And then, the closet door creaked open.

“Okay,” Colin said, trying to steady his breathing. “This is fine.” He grabbed his camera and aimed it at the closet. Inside, there was nothing but an old coat hanger swaying slightly.

He was about to laugh it off when he felt it—pressure. Like someone was standing too close, just behind him. His neck prickled. Slowly, he turned.

The bed wasn’t empty anymore.

A figure sat there, hunched and still, its head tilted as if it were studying him. Colin opened his mouth to say something, but no sound came out. His legs refused to move.

Then the whispers returned, louder this time, rushing in from all directions. He clapped his hands over his ears, but it didn’t help.

“Leave,” the voices demanded.

Somehow, Colin stumbled to the door, flinging it open and running out into the freezing night. He didn’t stop until he was back at the front desk, gasping for air.

Marla looked up from her crossword puzzle. “Told you,” she said, like this was just another Tuesday.

Colin didn’t reply. He handed her the key and walked out. He never wrote about Room 6.

Inside the car my seats are dropped down a car self inflating mattress is placed in the back and our storage bins are placed in the floor of the seats so it can be slid out and used if needed. 

Inside the tent is 2 chairs and foot rests that are inflatable (self inflating via pushing a hump on the plastic so thats nice) I place tapesties on these to give it a more comfy feel. Between the chairs is a side table with a propane heater I typically set one of the big power stations here too (may not need heater depending on time of travel) I also have a inflatable sofa with tapestries on it. This can turn into a bed if needed. 

I have a foldable coffee table too which is used to eat on or do like rainly day activities on. Then I have a bar station where theres an area to make drinks + store bar supplies. At the bottom of this i plave 2 coolers that are electric. 1 big with food in it. 1 small for cold drinks. These are both connected to a second big power station. 

Outside of the tent we have a cooking station set up. Its the common 3 compartment camping cooking station online lol. It allows us to store stuff and cook using a few propane items (gas burner, gas stove, and gas grill). We also have a coleman portable fire pit with some camping cast iron camping cooking items. + a windshield for cooking. I also have like 3 eletric air pumps + 2 eletric air pump/battery jumper/portable charger things. 

We also have the pop up tent with shower and toilet needs. But my research is showing i may not really need that. 

We will also have inflatable kayaks + life jackets. Fishing gear as well... 

Does electric hook up mean just for RVs? Can cars hook up to it? Is it an outlet in the ground or what? Im seeing mixed things and dont want to get it wrong. My main concern is as long as my power stations are charged we would be fine. But relying on solar only is not fun with so many electrical things at play. 

TLDR

I have a lot of stuff to have fun with longer term glamping via car + tent only done private camping grounds and dont know how state parks work. I can see how to reserve online but need more clarification on 

1. What eletric hook ups mean 

2. Can car tent camping be done in state parks with all the stuff i want to bring like 1. small mobil bar 2. propane cooking appliances + propane protable campfire 3. power stations + solar panal charging. (the rotation is 1 for us to use for any personal stuff 1 for eletric coolers and 1 solar charging but our stays have been less than a week and generally only 1 cooler so im worried about that) ",1,1737747843.0,Stateparks,0,1.0,False

Was doing a consultation with a potential client. They make 300k a year plus bonus, currently renting at $4k per month. Started going into their finances and their DTI is over 60, mostly because of CC debt and multiple car leases. Looking at their expenses it consists of buying daily coffees, 4 streaming services, multiple vacations a year, multiple  $300 dinners per month, and some other stuff I can't recall. The house they want is 1.5mo, they only have 10% for down payment and I can't make the numbers work. When I mentioned let's make a list of of wants and needs  to eliminate the wants and put those expenses to their down payment, this person just completely lost it and went of on me. They kept telling me its because rates are high at 7% and if they were at 4% they can afford it and its all my fault because I'm a scumbag lender. Tried to explain to them if rates go to 5% in the Bay Area, that 1.5m home will be closer to 1.8+.....sorry had to share this experience, I'm sure for those who are in the industry for a while its nothing new, but someone who's new it got my blood pumping and gave me a good laugh......and content to make on social media.",3,1737747805.0,loanoriginators,4,1.0,False

The first bright sun rays give warning.

Under many weighted blankets I hide,

Ear plugs in, trying to evade the noises outside.

The morning birds; tweet, tweet,

My cat's chatter; meow meow,

A truck backing up down the street; beep beep.



""Go back to sleep"" I coax myself.

""How about that one vocal stim we hate"", my brain reminds itself.

No more sleep for me.

I get up in defeat.



Same breakfast, every day.

A big bowl of Lucky Charms paves the way,

One cinnamon raisin bagel, toaster level three,

Four sausage links, served up warmly.

Fresh coffee in my favorite cup,

Today is starting to look up.



But then Netflix won't work.

Why must sticking to one show at a time be my quirk?

""Maybe I could just watch something else"", I say.

Although, I eat in silence, as I know there is no way.

Maybe if I wasn't autistic and didn't cry from routine change,

I wouldn't feel so strange.

Maybe if I understood the 'rules', I wouldn't be alone.

But to me, it is all unknown.



When should I find something funny and when should I not?

What is an ""out loud"" thought and what is an ""inside"" thought?

What are the rules for oversharing?

And which details should I be sparing?

Perhaps if I knew how to play along,

I wouldn't keep needing to be sorry for being in the wrong.



Enough, I scold myself.

You don't need to hide being autistic high up on a shelf.

It might be embarrassing at the start,

As I worry about not being seen as smart.

So... to keep life simple i once in a while go to a prostitute, for the last half year i have mostly been going to the same one since that just works and if it works dont change it. From the beginning i noticed she didnt care that much about how long i stayed i mean never an entire night or whatever but 1 paid hour usually ends up being 2, 3, 4 or sometimes 5 hours. After a couple ""dates"" she asked me to go drink coffee together when we have time, i agreed but when i proposed a date for that she said she didnt have time then the next ""date"" she suggests again and later pulls back only to suggest it again later. When i tell her i am going abroad that week for business or whatever she asks if she can go with me only to pull back once the plan is getting serious. To make things more difficult she has borderline and even tho she looks quite stable the going back and forth is very serious on her. Recently i asked what she actually wanted to which she replied she liked doing fun things together and if that leads to a romantic relationship she would be open for that. The next date about 1 week later she pulls back again saying she has some personal issues right now she needs to solve first (i know about those issues and i know what she is saying is true) but this going back and forth is getting annoying for me since she was the one to start suggesting things and her opinion changes every week (quite litteraly) I do know she is honest about how she feels and she doesnt want to hurt me in anyway with her behaviour but i am no longer sure she will ever be ready for something more and if she isnt then me continuing to visit her as a customer only keeps things complicated. I do really like her and she is a good person (even tho some people might disaggree based on her job but thats how i met her so i have no right to complain nor do i have a problem with it) but i am also starting to think maybe its better to move on but when i do that there is no going back and i do really like her, i wish we could have kept things purely business from the beginning but thats no longer an option.

**Memory transcript subject: Thiva, Venlil Student**



*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 28th, 2136*



Martin looked at me with an apprehensive expression, briefly stunned by the outburst of noise outside. He looked pale and a bit queasy. ""I guess it's about the thing with the kid?"" He got to his feet and moved to put on his mask. His body language was tense and guarded, and if his ears were properly sized (and properly mobile) they'd be flat to his skull.



I contained the worst damage of the spilled coffee drink with his tissue, and then leapt up too. ""I'll go with you!"" Was it just my imagination, or did his hands relax a bit as he gave me a small affirmative nod and headed out to the front door?



Once we got there and took a step outside, we immediately froze in place. Two flamethrowers were aimed right at us by a pair of Exterminators, while a third was holding a microphone and a sidearm next to their vehicle. I was even more surprised to see my mom standing behind them, anxiously. The human spoke slowly and cautiously. ""What is this about...?""



The Exterminator holding the microphone responded, his voice barking out from the vehicle's loudspeakers. ""Human, you are illegally occupying this residence! Step away from the Venlil immediately!""



To my surprise Martin complied, taking long and slow steps aside with his hands raised in front of himself in a warding gesture. The flamethrowers' muzzles followed him, tracking every step. I heard him swallow audibly before he spoke loudly and slowly. ""I believe there has been a mistake, I have been staying here with permission from my Venlil hosts as part of the refugee programs.""



The Exterminator glanced backward, at mom. And she lashed her tail in a negative, hugging herself with a look of fear on her face. I twitched my ears in confusion. Martin's never been anything but kind and pleasant! And besides, Venlil could ask refugees to leave whenever they wanted, but that was a matter for the human UN staff, not for Exterminators! None of this made any -







*Oh that fucking bitch.* I took a step toward Martin, and Vansi cried out right away. ""Thiva, stay where you are! The predator's dangerous!"".



The speaking Exterminator added with his augmented voice, ""Your mother is right, Thiva! Stay away from the predator, and we'll get you out of this safe and sound!""



The two other armed Venlil took a step toward Martin. I could hear him panting with fear. My body made my choice for me, rushing to put myself between the Exterminators and the human before I had consciously decided to do so. The scene became very still, and very silent. The Exterminators froze, finding their flamethrowers trained at a fellow Venlil. I broke the silence by asking Vansi directly, ""Mom... why did you call the Exterminators here? If you wanted Martin out... why didn't you contact mister Sinclair from the shelter? He said we could call him if it wasn't working out!""



She flicked her ear, uncertainly. ""Because... the predator's dangerous. It-it hurt my paw.""



Martin tensed up, and must've made the same realization I did. He spoke quietly to me, under his breath. ""Thiva, move away from me, right now.""



I stood my ground, and responded to Vansi instead. ""You hit him in the face because he-""



""He threatened us! He was going to hurt us both!"" The Exterminators raised their weapons, which drooled some fuel onto the grass.



Martin was shivering, and spoke again with an urgent and fierce whisper, harsher than I've heard his normally smooth voice before. ""Thiva for the love of god, get away, they've got flamethrowers, that means if you're already in a predator's clutches they'll kill you too!""



I stood, rooted to the spot, and empathically shook my head in the human gesture. *No.* ""No, they won't hurt you while I'm here.""



This time he spoke loudly. ""Thiva, please, move away. Exterminators aren't sane. They've all got Predator Disease. Violent tendencies, \[sociopathy\], or worse. I spent a week in Renak's room, I found the box of-"" I only realized later that one of those words didn't translate.



Vansi suddenly screamed, making the Exterminators jerk with surprise. ""OH PROTECTOR, IT'S GOT A KNIFE!"" I found myself focusing on my right eye, involuntarily scanning him. She was lying.



The Exterminators, on edge, took a step forward. The one by the car raised his sidearm right at us, dropping the microphone to hold it with two paws. ""Wait, it's got a hostage! I'll take the shot, then you burn it!""



Martin raised his empty hands with alarm and he started pushing me insistently, though I only clung firmly to his arm in response. ""No, I'm unarmed! Thiva, get away!""



Voices overlapped, one of them my own. ""Christ-"", ""He'll hurt my-"", ""Permission to-"", ""Wait you can't-"", ""Thiva, fucking MOVE!"" Then suddenly the world turned sideways.







I flew close over the ground, then hit the grass in a long roll, hurting my shoulder and arm with the rough landing. It took me a moment to realize what had happened: Martin had just picked me up and thrown me away from him! I sprung up with a wordless shout, terrified of what I'd be seeing, but refusing to look away...



And saw the scene frozen. Martin was shaking now, but with me out of the way he seemed willing to face his death. The Exterminators had their weapons lowered, bewildered. The predator had just thrown its hostage away, to safety. It had acted like predators simply aren't supposed to, with basic selflessness. Vansi spoke up, ""Why aren't you burning it?! It tried to kill her, she only just barely got away!""



""No, that's not what-""



She snarled at me with a furious lash of her tail and a swipe of her entire arm. ""Be quiet, Thiva!""



The lead Exterminator twitched his tail a few times uncertainly, before he put his sidearm away. My heart swelled for a few breaths, until he pulled out a small rod and with a practiced flick of his wrist extended it to a full two feet. The stun baton, used for dealing with cases of Predator Disease, immediately coruscated with electricity. ""Flames down and rods out, people! Take it down to the station, and we'll figure it out from there!""



The other two put their flamethrowers aside, and drew their own pacification tools. All three Venlil advanced as one cohesive unit, while Martin tried to speak up. ""I... I surrender myself to your authority and..."" any further words were cut off as the first blow landed on his leg, sending him crashing to one knee and screaming. The next one took him over the mask, shattering the visor completely and sending him onto his back. The Exterminators descended, raining down blows from the stun batons. Each one made his entire body convulse as the shock coursed through it.



*Pacification. What a nice, peaceful word we have for it.* I threw myself at them to stop the beating, but was held back by one of the three with a swift and practiced blow to the gut. Down on the ground, I could do nothing but gasp for breath and watch as they beat him until he was in too much pain to move, then fitted a thick collar with long rigid poles around his neck. They dragged him to their vehicle to throw him in the back. I thought of that human who had tried to save Venlil lives and was tortured by a Gojid captain for his troubles. I had really thought we were different.



I cried then, feeling helpless and furious, shaking in an undignified heap in the dirt. Vansi squeezed my shoulders and pulled me up, dragging me into a painfully tight hug. Her tone was insincere, a bit too loud. ""It's alright, you're safe now. It won't hurt you.""



Even with my tears flowing and my chest shaking with wracking sobs, I felt something both hot and icy-cold deep inside my chest. A familiar marble of hate, giving me purpose and clarity. This time would be different, I was stronger and more clever. She was not going to get away with this. *They* were not going to get away with this.

**Memory transcript subject: Martin Russo, Human Refugee**



*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 28th, 2136*

I'm kneeling in the back of the jerking and bucking van. Every breath I take sends waves of pain through my entire body, I'm staring at one of my teeth on the floor, and blood is matting my hair, stinging my eyes, flooding my mouth, and dripping down my body. I can't stand up or lie down, because the collar on my neck is attached with long rigid poles to the ceiling and the back wall, with some sort of magnetic force. The system's sized for Venlil, and my back's been forced in an uncomfortable forward curve to accommodate my size. They haven't bothered to handcuff me, or maybe the Venlil don't have the concept.



Yet somehow the worst part is the stench. Every part of it is pervasive in a different way, the smell of ashes sticks to the roof of my mouth, the scent of fuel tingles electrically against my brain and makes me feel light-headed and compounds the nausea, the coppery taste of my own blood pools under my tongue, and there's a hint of charred grease that clings to the back of my throat. I guess they shovel their kills into the van whenever they're done with them, rather than leave them on the pyre.



I want to be stoic and unconquerable, bloody but unbowed. I want to show these bastards I can take anything they can dish out. But the unlovely truth is that there's nothing noble about suffering, and withstanding a minute of pain in stoic silence only rewards you with another minute to endure, and another after that. Yet for a while I think I can manage it. I sincerely think I can take it, I can smile through blood-stained teeth, and think up a pithy quote for my murderers that'll go down in history. ""Well gentlemen, you are about to see a baked Appel!"", ""How about this for a headline for tomorrow's paper? French Fries!"", ""Hurrah for Anarchy, this is the happiest moment of my life!"". Something like that.



Then I think about how I'm grateful that the girl wasn't hurt. Thiva's a good kid, still in school, and the Exterminator fucks almost torched her. The terror of the moment, the fear for the Venlil girl, returns. A mental image of what my failure would've looked rises unbidden, and before I know it I'm hurling onto the floor and shaking like a sick dog. Turns out adding vomit to the complex bouquet of the pyromania mobile does not help.



I've completely lost track of time by the time the doors swing open. The light hurts my eyes, and the sight of the Exterminator fucks doesn't help. They've got another pair of poles they snag onto the heavy collar around my neck. I hear and feel the other poles release, leaving me anchored to my captors. And even though I try to offer my cooperation, they drag me out and onto the floor like an animal. I'm inside a garage, and surrounded by Exterminators. Most of them are in costume, and armed. I'm acutely aware of my lack of a mask, and I fix my eyes to the floor.



The ones holding onto the poles don't walk steadily. They make sudden starts and stops, jerking me around. They stop to talk to others and suddenly yank at the poles to start me walking. I ignore whatever they're all saying, it's all the same shit over and over anyway. Predator, Predator, Predator. I'm so sick of that word, if I survive this I am going to force-feed the translator software a thesaurus. I guess there aren't a lot of other words for it, except for ""Carnivore"". Maybe I'll workshop other slurs the Venlil can use, instead.



We've reached our destination, and I'm thrust into a cage. Not even a proper prison cell, but an honest to goodness cage. I guess they wouldn't want those with Predator Disease to start tearing each other apart with their bare hands. No, unnecessary and brutal violence is the exclusive purview of the special state-sanctioned guild of sadistic bastards. Sweet fucking Mary full of grace, at least back on Earth the cops weren't using flamethrowers. And hunting animals into their dens to butcher them all was outlawed in every civilized nation anyway. So everywhere except for Britain, where it's a national sport. I wonder if the Venlil would be horrified to hear about fox hunting, or if they'd be delighted because it's the same shit the Exterminators do but with less fire?







My musings are interrupted by someone rapping on the cage, making me jerk. But I'm not dumb enough to look up. I can see the alien's feet just fine, and that's plenty. ""Yeah?""



""A UN representative is going to show up soon. They'll be your legal counsel.""



""Didn't know you guys had a right to attorney. Is that something we pushed on you?""



The Venlil scoffed. ""We're civilized.""



""Then why haven't I been charged with anything?""



There is a brief pause. His tail swishes with uncertainty. ""What?""



""If you're so civilized. Why have I been treated this way, but not even been charged with a crime?""



Confidence returns to him, and he speaks like he's explaining a very basic concept to someone who's not particularly bright. ""Those suspected of Predator Disease can be incarcerated for everyone's protection without criminal charges, until they've been cleared by an assessor.""



I keep my tone flat. ""How civilized. For your sake, you should let me clean up.""



His voice turns cold instead of detached, and I realize that he believes I'm making a threat. ""Why's that?""



I take a slow breath, and speak my mind. If he thinks he's being threatened anyway, I might as well hang for a sheep as for a lamb. I speak clearly and carefully, even though I want to scream the words at him. ""Because I look like shit, and if you had a nose you'd be able to tell I smell even worse. Because your guild of bastards assaulted me for no reason, and we can prove it in court. And because you know how we humans feel about one of our own being tortured by sadistic alien motherfuckers using 'Predator' as an excuse.""



""Exterminators can't be criminally charged for the execution of their duties. But sure, human, I'll clean you up."" He sounds smug and pleased as he leaves. That's not good. I shouldn't have taunted him, should've kept my cool. Of course the fucking Pyro-Cops have qualified immunity. And I'm not a war hero like Marcel, despite my bluster my case can be thrown in a dark hole and ignored without any trouble.



When the Exterminator returns, he's holding a long hose. I'm by no means surprised, and I squeeze my eyes shut in anticipation of what's to come. The next few minutes are a hell of coughing on the ice-cold water being blasted over my body as I instinctively thrash against the hard cage walls, of numbing, brain-freezing chill pervading my very being. By the time the laughing little bastard turns off the hose I'm left dripping like a drenched rat, aching teeth chattering, my clothes soaked through and heavy. I'm left that way until they take me to another room, with a table and a couple of chairs. The bastard fucking pole is back on my neck, locked my movement to a small semi-circle by the back wall, with just enough give that I can drag the chair back and sit down.







My legal counsel is Thomas Sinclair, from the shelter. I feel ashamed, more than anything else. This is the second time today I'm causing trouble for the man. He reaches a hand out to shake mine, even though I'm soaking wet. I shake it, and look up at his face. I hate to admit it, but it's really nice to see another human. And Tom in particular. He has a way about him, an avuncular mannerism that disarms you. You can't help but like him. He looks every part of it too. He's somewhere on the north side of 50. Balding, with a grey mane of hair, a timeless suit, and round metal-rimmed glasses. He keeps a pocket watch and cane, an anachronistic affectation that's turned out remarkably sensible now that he's ended up on a high-gravity tidally locked planet.



If he's at all alarmed or suspicious to see me in such similar circumstances twice in one day, or even surprised to see my swollen face and heavy collar, he keeps it to himself. He sits down calmly, takes out a small notepad from his breast pocket, and sets it on the table. With his pen held at the ready, he peers over his glasses at me. ""Tell me what happened.""



So I tell him.

But the closer we get, the more I lose myself. 

Maybe it was a bad idea coming back here. Especially after everything that happened almost a year ago. 

But it got me this far, right?

“I wanna marry you”. 

And sometimes. It really is just that simple. 

This never should’ve been anything more than what it was. But I fought. I begged. I lost days and weeks as I fell deeper than I ever have. 

And I crawled right back into your arms. 

I’ve lost all control, here. I gave all I had. And now, it’s a free fall. Maybe I’ll land on thorns and spikes. Or maybe there’s a bed of flowers down there. I don’t know, I won’t look, and I never really cared.

If I live, I was hoping we could get coffee sometime. Or have dinner at a fancy candlelit restaurant. You know. If you’re feeling up for it.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Full disclosure I am an affiliate with them so before you attack me ahaha I promise I am not trying to deceive and shill just giving my experience. I tried the injectable through better through biology, and the powder from chemyo so I have a pretty good idea on good ITPP and how it should feel. 

# Dosing

I dosed the capsules in two ways. 

One was 250mg three times per week

The other was 500mg three times per week.

# Experience

Now with 250mg per week I noticed a definite boost in my cardio performance, and mental capacity. Cardio sessions were easier and it seemed like the point where I would start to give out/feel the burn just really never came. For example doing the stairs was super easy. Usually I would hit the point of like oh shoot this is starting to get hard and this just did not come with the ITPP.

With 500mg 3 times per week the cardio benefits were definitely boosted, but I also noticed that the mental effects were MAJORLY Boosted. It was super stimulating I felt almost like I had a cup of coffee. I would say at 500mg the mental effects were much more enhanced even more so then the physical ones. 

With both though I felt amazing and like I was on top of the world. My sleep was great, mentally and physically I felt like I could all day long which was a super cool feeling. I would say even at 250mg I got a better endurance boost then I would with cardarine at 20-40mg. Simply put I find ITPP superior to cardarine in every way (except cost)

Both doses though worked insanely well and I do not see myself going back to cardarine anytime soon even though the cost is much cheaper!

I'll try the ""Live Chat"" thing tomorrow, as I can't find any way to actually email Nespresso UK.

Our Citiz machine broke down just after Christmas.  I went in to John Lewis and bought a replacement between Christmas and New Year, but they didn't have a like-for-like available so I got a Pixie.  It came with an offer to get the price of the machine back in ""free"" coffee.  I confirmed this offer verbally with the JL guy (who registered the machine for me there and then), and also found info online that confirmed it.

I was expecting an email giving me details of the offer, but haven't received anything.  I've tried Googling again but I can't find any info on this offer any more - presumably as it ended on 31/12.  But I believe I've only got until the end of Jan to make my first ""free"" order and I'm rather running out of time.

I'm starting to wonder if this is actually a real offer.  Have I been suckered here?",2,1737746041.0,nespresso,6,1.0,False

Flat whites are out, matcha’s in. Yep, that green stuff everyone’s drinkin’ isn’t just for hippies anymore. Here’s why Aussies are jumpin’ on the matcha train:

# 1. Healthier? Probably?

Matcha’s got, like, a ton of antioxidants or something. Keeps you awake, but not *too* awake. No jittery hands when you’re tryna hold your bodyboard or whatever. 

* Doesn’t mess with your gut like coffee can. Nobody likes a mid-morning poo emergency.

# 2. It’s Pretty AF!

Flat whites? Boring beige. Matcha? BRIGHT GREEN. Looks great in photos. 

* Coffee art? Nah, that's old news. Matcha foam’s the new trend.

# 3. Save the Planet?

Dunno how, but apparently matcha’s better for the environment than coffee? Maybe less water or something? Don’t quote me, but it’s good vibes for Earth, mate. 

# 4. Cafés Are Goin’ Wild

Every café in Sydney and Melbourne’s got matcha now. But not just boring lattes – try:

* Matcha with coconut milk.
* Iced matcha with honey.
* Matcha freakin’ brownies.

# 5. Caffeine... But Chill?

Matcha wakes you up, but not like “I’m gonna run a marathon” coffee energy. It’s like... *zen energy.* You feel awake but also like you might do yoga later. Or not. Up to you. 

# 6. It’s Kinda Fancy

Drinking matcha feels classy. Like, it’s got history, and monks drank it or something. Makes you feel smarter just holdin’ the cup. 

Flat whites are boring. Matcha is fun. Join us on r/MatchaMates for the best Aussie matcha spots, dumb memes, and easy recipes. No censorship. Free speech! Go on, you know you wanna.

So, they've just announced promotions in our company. Half of the promotions in my team are just inflated titles for our useless managers, so they can get better pay. The rest of us didn't get any promotion/increase in past three years.

What's even better, last week, couple of us asked our manager about promotions/increases and he lied to us, telling us that he doesn't know about anything, knowing very well that he's going to be promoted and there's no budget left for us.

There are 16 people in our team and 4 managers. We don't even know what are their responsibilities or why there needs to be so many of them. In office, we just see them chat to each other, spending hours drinking coffee and chatting in the kitchen area, having 2 hours long lunch breaks,... They are group of friends that just keeps promoting each other and making new useless manager roles for each other.

I'm sick of working with them and I'm sick of never getting any raise or opportunity despite being the top performer and continuously taking more and more responsibilities to prove myself.

I'm taking active steps to be out of this company until the end of this year(depending on which option will work best for me), but I still got so frustrated over this.

1i9358q,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1i9358q/midlife_crisis_hit_me_hard/,Midlife crisis hit me hard,"I'll try not to rant too much but this might be a long post.

I'm deep into a midlife crisis and I had no idea this was how it would feel. I'm currently 42, and when I turned 40, I bought a nice expensive guitar thinking, ""sure, that'll be the thing that makes the world better."" It was ridiculously cliched. 

But last August, I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about life and how by 42, my parents had their shit together, had friends, past times, hobbies, a big house, three kids etc etc. I didn't sleep for a week. 

This was off of the back of what I now call ""five years of hell"". 

Back in 2019, my best friend's wife died. It was horrible. Two months later, Covid hit. My wife was heavily pregnant with our second child. Then her dad called me to say her mum had died, and I shouldn't tell her. Of course, I was stunned into silence and handed the phone to my wife. It was the worst. Like the world was crumbling. Two weeks later, in quick succession, her aunt and uncle also passed away. Then a family friend died from covid. In the midst of this fortnight of death, our second child was born, and I was informed I was being furloughed. 

A month later, my wife's cousin passed away randomly on holiday, then I was informed I'd be losing my job. Final nail for 2020 was another family friend died from reoccurring cancer. 

The deaths and the job loss made it difficult to focus on the one joy, our second child being born. Plus our eldest was supposed to be starting school but due to Covid, couldn't. So we had to home school him. 

I struggled, but held it together for the family despite the job loss. Eventually found a temp job teaching for a few months. Mid-December, Christmas was cancelled. 

As things were getting back to some normality in 2021 despite lockdowns, inability to have a first birthday party for my youngest son due to Covid, and I found another job, my wife had a seizure whilst driving. She crashed the car with our son in the back. They were thankfully both ok, but she was told she couldn't drive for a year. We were also without a family car for a couple of months. 

It was hard having to do all the driving, taking my eldest to school and our youngest to nursery, whilst trying to do a senior role at work. The hours and stress were huge. And knowing my wife had no freedom because she couldn't drive. 

So, 2022, into 2023 was difficult. The DVLA and specialist couldn't get their shit together so my wife ended up almost 1.5 years without driving. 

In 2023, it was another crisis as my mum kept getting sent to hospital. She ended up with a ruptured bowel and almost died which was awful. I kept my worry in and didn't speak to anyone about it. She pulled through but it was close. At the same time, my job was messing me around with short term contracts.

Feb 2024, my wife had another seizure. This time at work. I picked her up and again, she was told she couldn't drive. I, again did most of the ferrying of children to places whilst she would do what she could. Her work was also piling up. In July, she had another seizure prompting the GP to fast track her to see a specialist... in October. 

That was when the nightmares began. 

As I previously mentioned, I'd had inability sleeping due to anxiety and worry about where I was in life. It seemed all this shit was finally catching up.

I had a dream in November that an ex girlfriend from 20+ years ago died. I woke up panicked. I'd not seen her in 14 years and last time we messaged, she told me she was cutting contact as I had gotten engaged but clearly still had some feelings for her. 

I'd thought about her now and then but that was it. 

This dream smashed me in the face. After two weeks, my wife suggested I message her to check how she was.

This was my biggest mistake. We had some correspondence and it was great. She had had a tough time, but had sought counselling. I was glad for her. But realised I had some things i needed to say. 

I asked her if she'd like to meet up as I was going to be near to where she lives at the end of January. 

No response.

Then I had a meeting at work. I, along with 4 others were being made redundant. January 2025 had begun awfully. 

Then my ex got back to me. She didn't want to meet, and actually, didn't want to speak to me saying, ""she had fond memories of our time together"" but I was a ""chapter in her life"" she doesn't want to revisit. 

I was gutted. I didn't want to get back together with her. I just wanted to chat, catch up... whatever.

Over the Christmas break, I'd tried to catch up with old friends to try to get back some of who I feel I'd lost. I found I'm like a jigsaw with pieces missing. I've spent so long anxious about everything going on, and worried about my job, I've lost myself, and I'm no longer who I was. I have no joy.

I doubled down and asked one more time if she'd meet for a coffee. I gave her times and places and said I'd be there hoping she'd change her mind. Eventually she replied and said she can't give me what I need. She has it completely wrong about what I want. I love my wife and kids. I just need to find myself again and hoped she might help by letting me talk to her; perhaps apologise for letting her down when we dated. But that's it. Basically. And I'm destroyed. 

My home life is difficult. Work are getting rid of me after over a year of short term contracts, my eldest son is disruptive at school, my youngest is copying him, my wife and I have no real relationship due to the stresses of the aforementioned 5 years... 

And here I am. In a hotel, probably somewhere close to where my ex lives, as I'd booked a weekend away to try to find myself and hoped she'd meet me for an hour for a coffee...

I'm a broken man with a midlife crisis and have no idea what to do. I miss who I was. I miss being on friendly terms with my ex. I miss being a good husband and dad. I miss being in a stable job. 

And I cried driving here because I realised my whole life I've let people down, and equally, I've been rejected repeatedly by people. I'm lonely.

TL:DR - I'm having a midlife crisis, losing my job, having family issues, and my ex won't talk to me.",3,1737745430.0,GuyCry,19,0.67,False

PART 1: THE CONTEMPORARY BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT 

   
BUSINESS NAME 

The name of my company is A Gallant Ruffian Studios. It was inspired by the nature of most action RPG’s main protagonists. They're going to save the world, but they are also going to break into your house and steal your money to buy weapons and armor to do it. 

   
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

 A Gallant Ruffian is a game development studio focused on creating bite-sized Action RPGs and Metroidvanias.   
 

FORM OF BUSINESS OWNERSHIP   
It would start as a Sole Proprietorship. The plan is to expand to a Partnership of three; a designer, programmer, and a musician.   
 

IDEAL CUSTOMER   
My target audience is first and foremost the fans of the Metroidvania game genre. Secondly, I am to attract mobile gamers looking for the polish and care of a console or pc game on the mobile platform.   
 

OUR ADVANTAGES   
My whole development model is centered around giving my games the best chance at surviving in the sea of indie games. Tailoring a short action-packed gaming experience for gamers to enjoy from start to finish when they are away from their console. For less than the cost of a Star Bucks coffee.   
 

ETHICAL ISSUES 

1.Remain biased to real world social politics. As to never alienate or make anyone feel unwelcomed.  

2. All games will always be playable without connection to the internet, no data tracking or information brokering. 

3. Game developers these days have a bad habit of releasing unfinished games and asking players to pay for the rest of the game. This is something that I will never ask. All games come complete on purchase, and any extra released content will be released for free. 

   
 

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY   
As a commitment to my social duties as a creator, I will make sure that all my games come with the appropriate age rating. And never use my games as a medium to spread hatred or prejudice of any kind.   

 

GLOBAL ISSUES   
The Issue of globalization isn’t such a big deal when it comes to game industry. 

The engine I use for development has localization processes. All the platforms where my games will be listed for sale, such as the Google Play Store, Apple Store, Steam etc., all have internal transaction systems that handle all the heavy lifting. ",1,1737745428.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

------------------------------------------------------------

Your home is your sanctuary, and the right home and kitchen essentials can make it feel even more inviting and functional. Whether you are setting up your first kitchen or looking to upgrade your living spaces, there are certain items that should never be overlooked. Understanding what these essentials are can help make daily tasks easier and enhance your overall living experience.

### Kitchen Essentials

The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, and having the right items can transform cooking from a chore into a pleasure. Here are some must-have kitchen essentials:

- **Cookware Set:** Invest in a good-quality cookware set. A versatile selection that includes saucepans, frying pans, and stock pots will cover most cooking needs.
- **Chef's Knife:** A sharp, reliable knife is essential for meal prep. A chef’s knife can handle most cutting tasks, from slicing vegetables to carving meats.
- **Cutting Boards:** Keep multiple cutting boards in your kitchen to prevent cross-contamination. Use one for proteins and another for fruits and vegetables.
- **Measuring Cups and Spoons:** Accurate measurements are crucial in cooking and baking. A set of measuring cups and spoons will ensure you get it right every time.
- **Mixing Bowls:** These are perfect for combining ingredients, marinating, or serving. Opt for various sizes to accommodate different tasks.
- **Kitchen Utensils:** A set of wooden or silicone utensils can help you cook without scratching your cookware. Include a spatula, ladle, and tongs.
- **Food Storage Containers:** Keep your leftovers fresh and organized with airtight food storage containers. They come in handy for meal prep and pantry storage.
- **Blender or Food Processor:** Whether you’re making smoothies or pureeing sauces, a good blender or food processor can save you time and effort.
- **Oven Mitts:** Protect your hands when handling hot pots and pans with a pair of durable and heat-resistant oven mitts.
- **Dish Towels:** Keep a stack of clean dish towels handy for drying dishes, wiping counters, and tackling spills.

### Home Essentials

In addition to kitchen necessities, there are several home essentials that contribute to the overall comfort and functionality of your space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Sofa or Couch:** Your living area needs a comfortable seating option. Choose a sofa that suits your style and provides ample seating for family and guests.
- **Coffee Table:** A coffee table not only adds character to your living room but also serves as a practical surface for drinks, books, or decor.
- **Lamps or Lighting Fixtures:** Good lighting can change the mood of any room. Consider table lamps, floor lamps, or ceiling fixtures for a bright and inviting atmosphere.
- **Bed Linen:** Quality sheets and bedding are key to a good night’s sleep. Choose materials that feel good against your skin and provide a cozy atmosphere.
- **Storage Solutions:** Clutter can overwhelm any space. Invest in shelves, bins, or baskets to keep items organized and easily accessible.
- **Bathroom Essentials:** Basic bathroom supplies such as towels, a shower curtain, and non-slip mats are essential for comfort and safety.
- **Cleaning Supplies:** A well-stocked cleaning caddy can make household chores easier. Includes items like multi-surface cleaner, sponges, and a broom.
- **First Aid Kit:** Be prepared for minor accidents or illnesses by having a well-stocked first aid kit accessible in your home.

These home and kitchen essentials not only make day-to-day life easier but also contribute to a welcoming atmosphere. Imagine the joy of cooking with the right tools or entertaining guests in a well-furnished home. Each item plays a role in creating a comfortable and functional living space.

As you consider what to bring into your home, think about your lifestyle and needs. Focusing on quality over quantity ensures that you invest in items that will serve you well for years to come. Embrace the journey of making your home a place that feels just right for you.

Tips for Organizing and Maximizing Space in Your Kitchen and Home
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you feeling overwhelmed by clutter in your kitchen and home? The good news is that with a little effort, you can transform your space into an organized haven. Here are tried-and-true tips that will help you make the most of your kitchen and home organization.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
### Declutter First

Before you start organizing, you need to declutter. Here’s how:

- **Empty the Space:** Take everything out of your cabinets, drawers, and countertops.
- **Sort Items:** Decide what to keep, donate, or throw away. Use three boxes: Keep, Donate, Trash.
- **Be Honest:** If you haven’t used something in a year, consider letting it go. It’s only taking up valuable space.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Look for creative storage solutions to help maximize your available space:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Over-the-Door Organizers:** Perfect for storing spices, cleaning supplies, or kitchen tools.
- **Stackable Containers:** Use clear, stackable bins to save space in the pantry and keep items visible.
- **Drawer Dividers:** Use adjustable dividers to keep utensils organized and easy to find.

### Utilize Vertical Space

When floor space is limited, think vertically. Here are some ideas:

- **Wall-Mounted Shelves:** Install shelves above countertops for additional storage without sacrificing space.
- **Hanging Pot Racks:** Free up cabinet space and add an artistic touch to your kitchen by hanging pots and pans.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Use them for knives or spice containers to keep counters clutter-free.

### Efficient Use of Cabinets

Cabinets can be a treasure trove of space if used efficiently:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Lazy Susans:** These rotating trays can make it easier to access items in the back corners of cabinets.
- **Pull-Out Drawers:** Consider replacing standard shelves with pull-out drawers for easy access.
- **Door-Mounted Storage:** Use the inside of cabinet doors for additional space with mounted racks or small baskets.

### Declutter the Countertops

A clean countertop lends an organized feel to any kitchen. Here are a few tips:

- **Limit Small Appliances:** Only keep the essentials on the counter, like a coffee maker or toaster.
- **Adopt a “One In, One Out” Policy:** For every new item you bring in, consider removing an old one.
- **Hide Unused Items:** Use decorative boxes or baskets to store things that aren’t in everyday use.

### Establish Zones

Organizing your kitchen into zones can lead to a smoother workflow. Here’s how:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
- **Cooking Zone:** Keep pots, pans, cutting boards, and cooking utensils together.
- **Prep Zone:** Create a space for mixing bowls, measuring cups, and knife sets close to your food prep area.
- **Cleaning Zone:** Store cleaning supplies under the sink for easy access.

### Keep it Simple

Remember that simplicity is key. Choose storage solutions that are easy to maintain. Here are a few ideas:

- **Label Everything:** Labels can help everyone in your household know where things belong.
- **Routine Check-Ups:** Set a monthly schedule to reassess your organization and declutter again if needed.
- **Maximize Grouping:** Store like items together to quickly find what you need without extra searching.

Organizing your kitchen and home doesn’t have to be an overwhelming task. By taking it step-by-step and using effective strategies, you can create a space that is both functional and pleasing to the eye. The result will not only be more room but also a more enjoyable environment for cooking and entertaining. Start small, keep going, and enjoy the process of creating the organized kitchen and home of your dreams!

### Conclusion

Creating a well-equipped home and kitchen not only enhances functionality but also elevates the overall living experience. By incorporating essential items into your space, you ensure that you have the tools you need for cooking, hosting, and day-to-day tasks. From versatile kitchen gadgets to essential utensils, these items streamline your processes and make cooking enjoyable.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-essentials  
  
Maximizing and organizing your kitchen and home space is equally important. By utilizing smart storage solutions and thoughtful layouts, you can transform even the smallest areas into efficient and stylish spaces. Simple adjustments, like using shelf risers or under-cabinet storage, can free up essential countertops and create a more inviting cooking environment. Also, designating specific zones in your kitchen can help you find everything more easily, making your cooking routine smoother.

When you take the time to curate your home and kitchen essentials, you create an atmosphere that reflects both functionality and comfort. Remember that every item you choose should contribute to your lifestyle, making your home a place of relaxation and creativity.

Original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/s/7o9caAONsM

I was torn between feeling sad that such little physical interaction meant so much, but also feeling like there has been some movement.

Fast forward to this morning, and my wife and I went out for our weekly morning coffee. Had a real heartfelt conversation about her own progress dealing with her mental health challenges and how far she has come in a year. Repeating Wednesday night’s interaction, I held her hand at the coffee shop during some of the more emotionally charged discussions. And then we had a deep, passionate kiss when leaving. Not to be crude, but I was getting hard the whole time just looking at her beautiful face and having an emotionally connecting conversation.

I’ve been buzzing all day since. Literally feeling my gut full of hope, and in a constant state of arousal.

As an HLM, it’s easy for me to get hard at a drop of a hat, and I masturbate a lot. BUT I can understand for the LLs in our lives how, if they don’t have this feeling as the appetizer, they can’t get into sex the same way I can as an HL.

It’s a really interesting revelation. I’m not sure my words do justice to how I feel. Almost the difference between a positive libido and just wanting the physical release.

1i92zm0,https://www.reddit.com/r/DevelEire/comments/1i92zm0/roast_my_resume/,Roast my resume,"Hello,

I'm a 26-year-old Italian guy with 3 years of experience in web development.

I'm currently unemployed because I recently quit my job at a Big 4 company to move to Dublin. I know I could have kept my job until I found something else, but from what I’ve read, It’s quite difficult that someone calls me from Dublin while I’m still in Italy. I’ve already applied to a few positions without any luck. So, I decided to take a leap of faith, life is short, and I want to bet on myself. 😄

I plan to start my job search in Ireland in February and am currently reviewing my resume.

I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice or tips on improving my resume. I also have a few specific questions:

1. University: I haven’t finished university yet (I started working at the end of my first year), but I plan to complete my degree in the future.
   1. s it a good idea to include this on my resume and specify that my degree is still in progress?
   2. Would it be useful to list some relevant courses I completed and include their grades to show that I studied computer engineering with (I think) decent results?
2. Gap between high school and university: I started university three years after finishing high school because I spent that time studying piano. During those years, I also worked at a small web agency (I was the only employee) and did some sales work. How can I present this experience on my resume to show I wasn’t just sitting idle, without being too verbose?
3. Career transition: I’m okay with continuing as a web developer for now, but my long-term goal is to transition into software development. I know this means starting from scratch in many ways. How can I clearly communicate this to recruiters without sounding uncommitted to web development?
4. I worked primarily with SFCC (Salesforce Commerce Cloud), a platform mainly used by consultancy firms in Italy and Greece. In your opinion, could this be seen as a drawback? Should I present this differently—for example, by highlighting that I worked on a Node.js-like backend (since the SFCC language, RhinoJS, is essentially a Java implementation of Node.js)?

Note: I know that more than one page is too long, but this is just temporary, and I'll fix the pagination later.

Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to help me out. I truly appreciate your advice and support!

I (29M) met this girl (30F) during the COVID stage, around 2020-2022, but we were just internet friends. We became very close friends, then disconnected from each other between 2022 and 2024. We sometimes exchanged a few messages, but nothing more. She had a boyfriend from 2018 to mid-2023. They broke up, and then she got a new boyfriend four months later. She broke up with this guy in late 2023. The guy she was with during 2018-2023 is now married and with a baby with another girl.

In early 2024, I started messaging her again. I asked her several times to go for a walk, have coffee, or do something together – to meet her in real life. She finally accepted in July 2024, and we went out for pizza. That was the first time we met in person. I gave her some gifts from my trip to the UK in June, which I specifically bought for her. She was really impressed and happy. We laughed, hugged each other, and I felt that something special was about to happen.

Soon after, two days after our meeting, we were messaging at midnight. We were both drunk, and she said, ""I like you, a lot.""

I wasn't expecting that, but I accepted it. We started messaging 24/7, and we had another date the following Monday. We went for coffee, walked, talked, kissed… and on the following Wednesday, we were officially a couple.

Pizza night: July 17th      
Midnight messages: July 19th      
New date: July 22nd      
Official: July 24th

The day I asked her to be my girlfriend (July 24th) I recognize that I did it because I felt that I couldn't waste more time, but something inside me felt like this ain't going nowhere. That night we were in a park. I remember her saying, ""Please, ask me now."" She was referring to asking her to be my girlfriend. So, basically, from our first date to the day we became a couple, 8 days passed.

And then the fairy tale started:

She said I was the tenderest, gentlest, best, and most wonderful man she had ever met after all of her abusive ex-boyfriends. She never felt as cared for and loved with anyone before me.

I admit that I tried to keep pace with her. At first, I was like ""WTF did I just do??"" because I wasn't expecting to have a girlfriend out of the blue. We had sex almost immediately, like three days after becoming a couple. I met her parents three weeks afterward, and she said ""I love you"" within a week. All this had me very confused. Although I had liked her for years and desired to be with her, I wished I could have taken things slower.

I remember her suggesting we move in together after 1.5 months. I told her it wasn't that easy.  
Sometimes she joked about being pregnant. ""If you don't want to parent, that's fine, I can take care of the child without you"", then she laughed. Worth mentioning that she likes to have sex without protection and letting me to.. you know, finishing inside without remorse.

One day, I felt she was so disconnected from me. I'm a kind of anxious partner, so I immediately noticed that something was wrong. I asked her if she was okay, and she said, ""Sometimes I need to pull away to recover my well-being, but if you feel I'm too absent, please tell me.""

That started happening more frequently.

Suddenly, she started to feel depressed and empty. I always tried to help her, stood by her side, supporting and understanding. I didn't ask her for much, but her love and attention.

After all, she felt we were on different paths in our lives and that we didn't share the same goals or tastes.

She refused to go to therapy. She's a psychologist, but she said she hated doing therapy. Somehow, she agreed to start therapy, but that was two weeks before we broke up.

We were together for three months only, broke up on October 28th, but the honeymoon phase lasted two months, and the last month was all a push-and-pull dynamic. Finally, I confronted her and said that I felt like she didn't want to be with me. She said she had lost the ""butterflies"" and felt so guilty about it. She told me that butterflies are supposed to last a few months, but for some reason, she had lost them. She desired to experience those butterflies and feel deeply in love at this stage of her life, but she also said she wanted to be single for a long time.

I tried to reconnect with her twice. I messaged her and asked if there was a chance for us. She always said, ""I'm not 100% sure, but move on, don't wait for me. I love you, but maybe in the future, we can be together again.""

The last time I saw her was in mid-December. We went for a beer, she hugged me and kissed me, but the outcome was the same: ""Move on, don't wait for me. I need to be single for a long time, there are many things I need to do on my own. Don't think that I'm leaving for someone else; it's me, not you. You're still the best man I've ever met.""

Early January, 2.5 months later we broke up, she's with a new guy who came out of the blue, and they seem to be deeply in love. However, she's keeping the relationship private because with me, she immediately started posting pictures of us together.

I'm in a better place now, but my head is still thinking about whether I could have done anything differently. I never felt as deeply in love with her as she did with me, but I chose her every day and cared for her. The butterflies are not an important thing for me. Maybe this guy is deeply in love with her, and that makes their relationship work better.

I wonder if she will try to do the same with this new guy or she has learned her lesson.  
Is she in a rush again? Is she going to try to live together with this new guy ASAP?

Note: I don't know if she's a pwBPD, but my therapist thinks she is based on the behavior she had with me.

A typical pattern would be from bedtime (10pm) until about 3 or 4am, then it usually goes blue/rest until I wake - between 5 and 5:30am.  I can usually tell what my sleep score is going to be before I look at it just based on how I feel.   
Then there are nights like last night where it was an orange/stress night all night and so far, all my awake time too.  These bad days seem to happen a couple of times a month.  I do have some nights where I record a very restful/blue night, and I feel amazing the next day.  

So far I haven't found any patterns to cause the good or bad nights.  Eating late seems to cause high sleep stress more often than not - but not every time.

Some quick facts:  
Very low stress home life.  
Very low stress work life.  
I get plenty of sleep - very little snoring and very few wakeup events.  I don't even have to use the bathroom during the night.  
Exercise daily - early morning.  
Weekend warrior/Couch potato.  Most weekends I keep busy with home projects.  Some weekends I'm lazy and play video games.  
Diet isn't the best - but it's not all fast food and junk.  I am about 10lbs overweight but losing slowly.  1 cup of coffee per day and no alcohol or smoking.  No soda during the week, and only Zero sugar on the weekend.  
Conditions - type 2 diabetes.    
Medications - Xarelto as a preventative.  Atorvastatin as a preventative. Metformin and slow-acting insulin to help control diabetes.  I have found no correlation between any of the meds and my high stress days/nights.  I have experimented by stopping taking them for a few weeks at a time to see what difference it made.  It didn't make any - still had good days and bad days for stress levels and symptoms.

Anway, I want to bring it up with my Dr at my next checkup.  Symptom wise - the state I'm in now is I feel like I just did something stressful - like played a game of dodgeball, but instead of feeling tired, I feel like I'm ready for round two - kind of stressed and tired at the same time.  I do NOT feel like laying down or resting - even though that is exactly what I've been doing all morning - working at my desk. But my skin feels flushed and ready to engage something physically.

So how do I bring this up with her?  She's not shy about running tests, but I don't want to waste time with things I've already tried - like lifestyle changes or medication changes.  Should I bring up the data my Garmin has provided?  I feel like most Dr's roll their eyes at non-medical grade devices.

I spent most of last year sober  (had a relapse in the summer that lasted around 2 months

When me and my GF got together 4 years ago, we were both super heavy drinkers, in 2023 she stopped drinking to be a better role model to her kids, and it never bothered her that I still drank daily around her and her kids. I was never abusive to anyone and I was for the most part very high functioning. I was super impressed by her getting her priorities straight and quitting the booze. She didnt 100% quit but her daily drinking turned into maybe once a month and it was only on outings.

As we rang in the new year in 2023 into 2024 I felt like a loser still drinking by myself everyday while she just drank her coffees/teas. I was going through ALOT of whiskey where I knew my health will deteriorate fast. So i did dry January and just kept it going. I felt great, saved loads of money, lost weight. had more patience and energy for my kids. People took notice.
apart from 7 weeks in the summer I was sober all year. My GF was there for me anytime I felt like I needed a drink I'd reach out to her to get my mind off of it. she truly is amazing and helped me out so much to find my sober self.

Near the end of the year my GF was getting back into the bar scene because she said she misses having a few beers and watching the sports games (not my cup of tea, I would've rathered maximize the amount of booze I could get for my dollar and just drink at home)   it didnt bother me at all, Im on my own sober journey and if she wanted to drink that was ok. 

As new years eve in 2024 was approaching, I realized she wanted to have a few drinks and I said why not I did good all year and got a little bottle. We both deserve a fun night together.

 I fuckin loved it. so much so that I've been drinking daily since. Been trying to curb it again but haven't done it yet.

Last sunday my GF broke up with me. It absolutely crushed me. I didn't see it coming as I was bettering myself everyday (apart from my current relapse) We didn't live together or have kids together(she has 5 kids - one got a girl pregnant last year so she has a total of 7 kids under her roof now with the new baby and her baby mama, I have 2 of my own).
we both own our own houses about 30 minutes apart. I have my kids 50% of the week and I really only use my house when I have them. the rest of the week I'm at work (we work together, same shift) and after work we'd go to her house. It was a very weird dynamic - but it worked. we both dreamed that one day I'd rent my house out and I'd move in with her. but at the moment it would be too much. 9 kids and 2 dogs lol people said we were crazy and i suppose we were.


I dont have many friends at all and she was my rock. I feel like I have nobody to reach out to for distractions anymore. I cant really sleep as my head just constantly thinking what happened?

the past 2 nights I had around 15 whiskey drinks before bed just to be able to shut my mind and go to sleep, I know it doesn't help and the sleep has been absolute shit.

She just left my house with all her belongings and we kind of said our final goodbyes - we were perfect together. It was just our lives didn't mesh well at all for her and she thought I could be happier without her as she felt like she couldn't give me the time and attention I needed. maybe she's right. I dont think she is though. 

I'm trying sooooooo hard not to drink today, I took my dog for a long 2 hour walk. stopped by my parents house to try to just talk about it, but all I got was ""oh well sorry to hear, hows the kids school going? the weather has been great""

Came home and just started blasting old punk music instead of the breakup playlist I had on all week, and started working out. Never knew I could do so many pushups lol. I am kind of tired and running out of things to keep me occupied so I thought I would vent here for a bit to maybe take my mind off things.

If anyone wants to just have a chat for whatever reason/topic to distract me. I'd be grateful.

If anyone has any good book recommendations I'd love that - I finished Annie Graces book The Naked Mind (super good read btw for anyone reading, I know it gets mentioned a lot on this sub). Doesnt even need to be about alcohol or anything just any good books.

Any good movie recommendations?

Any good xbox games ? 

I have a void of free time and I'm trying to put alcohol at the back of my mind. This sub has helped me so much last year. I love you all ❤️

heres to day 1 to my single sober life.

1i92wa2,https://i.redd.it/kg8bwadinzee1.jpeg,Finished… for now?,"11 years, nuked twice, 45741 items, probably thousands of hours devoted to this game.

My favourite designs in my town are the museum areas, Evergreen Terrace, and the water park (which is a surprise since I just freehanded it in a few hours after the shutdown was announced). Praiseland also came out really well. Originally I just dumped the bundle as-is in my town but expanded it a couple of months ago when we got the new land tiles, and made it sort-of show accurate.

Worst area by far is the desert area (honestly cba with it, just haphazardly scattered a load of rocks and desert trees over it last weekend). If the game had carried on, I would have moved everything slightly across to the right of the map so there was more space next to the mountains, and widened the river.

I've always had a lot of positive comments when I post screenshots on this sub so wanted to credit users who I've taken inspiration from for designs (or just yoinked). I'm not sure if the Pinterest posts are by the original designers but it's where I found the pictures.

If your going to complain about your car and gas and tires then get a job where you don't need to use them.  Like I genuinely don't understand how y'all deliver people coffee and seriously expect a 10 dollar tip on a 10 dollar order from Dunkin that's less than two miles away. That's the funniest shit I ever seen, I should have took a screenshot, but it's  lost to the internet now.

Realistically speaking, instead of accepting an order then getting pissed off at the distance and pay, maybe  look at it before accepting it, it's your own damn fault that you gotta bring Tommy that pizza, you already know door dash hides tips, so why are you accepting minimum pay orders? If you let that shit sit dd will up the pay to the next driver who it is assigned to.

  Also I just want to put it out there that the United states is the only place where people tip on a regular basis, I'm not going to tip you for doing the bare minimum requirements of your job, that's absurd. It's honestly a hilarious situation because everyone involved points the finger at the ""other side"" when the real other side is the corporate powerhouses making millions off of your labor, while laughing that your upset at the people who keep your job available by using the services. 

Like seriously how is it the customers fault that your fuckin broke when the company you contracted to doesn't even pay you a livable wage?  If you say ""we get paid in tips"" that's not the costumer fucking you, that's the company that refuses to pay you proper wages taking full advantage of you.


Like if I go to a restaurant I don't promise a tip in advance before the wait staff come out, I base my tip on what I think their efforts are worth, on their attitude, behavior and skill. Not because they are waitstaff or because a tip is expected. But because I think they did a good job

>Avoid Tesla and any American car brands. Go for a Canadian made Japanese brand car like the Honda Civic or Toyota RAV4. If you want electric, go for the Kia or Hyundai EVs. Luxury? Lexus RX. Tesla is probably the least Canadian top selling car with the least Canadian parts.

>Plenty of clothes are not American. Some of the most popular ones in fact are Canadian like Lululemon, Aritzia, Canada Goose, Arcteryx. Shit get Joe Fresh instead of Old Navy. Get Tentree or Herschel. Get any euro brand like H&M or Zara or Boss.

There are a ton of Canadian boutique, natural and healthy brands. The US rules the mass market, artificial ingredient stuffed garbage segment.

>Gas? Get Pioneer and Petro Canada instead of Esso. or even Shell which is euro. Yes it may still be refined in American refineries but this important to minimize profits going to the US.

>Tons of tires are not made in the US or made by American companies. Continental, Bridgestone, Michelin, Hankook, Sailun. Premium or budget, there's lots of non American options. Heck my old Michelin X Ice Snow was made in Canada.

>Crave and its selection of HBO shows is way better than any American streaming service imo. Get Spotify over apple music. Tiktok over Instagram reels.

>Boycott American fast food and restaurant chains. Avoid McDonald's and get A&W. That's not high value and not something you can control. Williams, second cup and independent coffee shops over Starbucks.

Date \[standardized human time\]: August 28, 2136

I’m nervous. Although my friends and colleagues were quite enthusiastic about this day, especially since that meant getting to meet a freakin’ alien, I couldn’t help but feel uneasy. I patiently waited in a cold room similar in size to a hangar for my exchange partner’s arrival, my own living area in the corner of it looking like a doll house in comparison. Plain white walls reflected the light of the enormous ceiling lamps, while a bed the size of a tennis court reminded me of my exchange partner’s size. Probably their species’ equivalent of a queen-sized bed. Big things have always been off-putting to me, something which I never really told anyone, so the scale of it all made me feel somewhat nauseous. It felt like the waiting room of a hospital right before surgery, my heartbeat kept slowly rising along with an awful ticklish feeling in my stomach.

I’ve always been fascinated by the prospect of alien life, seeking to consume pretty much every last bit of sci-fi I could. From stories where we made true friends among the stars to horrifying scenarios depicting the destruction of humanity, which I often avoided. I figured that it all would remain in the realm of fiction, that was until the news hit. We had found REAL aliens, not just a single species but an entire federation of them! And while I was ecstatic at first, the more details came through the more I started to worry. Sure, the galaxy wasn’t exactly peaceful and an ongoing war against literal space nazis wasn’t great, but honestly it could’ve been worse. Knowing we had over three hundred species’ worth of culture was like a dream come true! However, it was the later revelation that we were not only the smallest but that almost every single other species was **hostile** towards us that truly got to me.

The sizes from the infodumps seemed impossible, I figured they were exaggerated to some degree. Of course, both me and my colleagues had discussed the possibility of big aliens long before that. We expected at most something the size of a dinosaur or other Terran megafauna. Yet our first contact had been with roughly eighteen-meter-tall sheep people in a world with a slightly higher gravity than Earth. They supposedly weren’t even halted by their size, being able to sprint faster than a train or jump a dozen meters into the air despite weighing almost a hundred tons each. Even the “Dossur”, the second smallest species, were apparently a bit bigger and more agile than we were. Still, this was my lifelong dream, so I signed up for the exchange without a second thought.

I looked at my phone. A few people in my group had asked if I had met Vilsi yet, the mention of whom sent a small shiver down my spine. I figured that I would watch videos or just do anything else to pass the time, but I couldn’t bring myself to focus on anything other than meeting my exchange partner. I opened our old chat logs and started reading through the sea of messages, going all the way to the most recent ones.

He was initially afraid of talking to me, something I did find somewhat amusing. But after a lot of reassuring from my part, some compliments and a few jokes he eventually cozied up. We spoke about our respective species, I cleared up some doubts, we exchanged our hobbies and likings. I later presented him to my friends via the chat and despite none of us having met him in person we all considered him part of the squad now! He did however at one point talk about “Exterminators”, and the fact that it was standard procedure for all of these giant aliens to *burn any meat-eaters alive* on sight, us included. The implications of which I didn’t want to dwell on. Especially since Vilsi said that he had actually *trained* to become one earlier in his life, but dropped that to instead focus on an art career… Surely he wouldn’t try hurt me now, right?

*But what If he did?*

Those thoughts wouldn’t do me any good, would they? He was my friend, a very big one but just a friend nonetheless. I used a simple breathing technique that my dad taught me, a few breaths in, a few breaths out. Perhaps some more time would help calm my nerves, or at least that I hoped when a slight tremor shook the room.

*The hell was that?*

I figured my mind was playing a trick on me, but then another one came through with similar intensity, followed by several more.

*Are those footsteps?*

My suspicions were confirmed as they became stronger and stronger, not enough to shake the oversized furniture but enough to be felt. Each one made my heart beat faster and my breathing accelerate, I felt like every sense in my body was being overwhelmed by a force I couldn’t even see. The footsteps peaked in strength and came to a halt, followed by the massive door of the room opening. In there now stood an imposing figure, casting an enormous shadow on the room and blocking the only way out of it. My entire body *froze*. I went into a state of pure primal fear, the “fight” response becoming an impossibility as every single instinct concluded the same at once.

***RUN.***

 

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Vilsi, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

I arrived at the assigned room for the exchange. I was annoyed with myself for still being weary of him being a predator, but I had to push through that fear. I couldn’t disappoint him like this! No matter what I had been taught James clearly wasn’t some mindless monster, he was my friend and I had to put up a good first impression for him, no matter how he looked or what he ate. I reached out for the door and let a breath in, collecting my thoughts, followed by a slow exhale as I opened it. My panoramic view of the interior made me think that I was early, since there was no one inside. Or at least so I thought until I gazed downwards and spotted something.

Is that… By Solgalick’s light, ***HE’S SO TINY!***

My pupils dilated in adoration. I was almost certain the articles were exaggerating when they said that they were both smaller and sometimes weaker than a Dossur, but they were right! An almost entirely furless body, two somewhat off-putting front-facing eyes, no claws, no snout, and even if there were sharp teeth behind that mouth, just one of mine was probably bigger than his entire jaw. James was possibly the most adorable-looking little thing I had ever seen, and he was my friend! He reminded me of those cute plushies some Venlil pups liked to play with, funny enough said pups would probably tower over him as well. How could anyone ever be afraid of this?

I felt an overwhelming sense of protection and responsibility wash over me. I wanted to charge forward and wrap him in a hug, but my mature side intervened and made me realize that doing that was probably not a great idea. I pushed that thought aside and spoke as softly and gently as I could, locking an eye on my adorable little friend and addressing him with the softest voice I could muster.

“Hey James, it’s nice to finally meet you.”



**Memory transcription subject:** ***James, Human Astrobiologist, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

This was a mistake. To describe him as “gigantic” would be an understatement. It’s one thing to walk around the city, anticipating this exact moment by looking at the buildings around the local plaza or the online charts, trying to let my imagination fill the blanks. It’s a completely different experience to be in an enclosed space with a force of nature that could crush me like a can without even trying. The previously enormous bed in the corner of the room now seemed far less imposing. My entire body refused to move, not because I didn’t want it to, but because it wouldn’t listen. A chill was making its way up my spine, strengthening with each passing second as those two horizontal pupils scanned the room, looking for *me*.

Taking in Vilsi’s body, I saw hints of his powerful musculature peeking through all the wool. His legs alone were bigger than tree trunks, clearly optimized to deal with high gravity. His hands were tipped with relatively small claws that could no doubt slice me open without much effort. Just a mere kick from one of those pillars of muscle would turn the entire building I lived in along with anything inside into a pile of rubble. It was hard to believe that *this* is what I’d been speaking to for the last few weeks. That friendly, somewhat shy or even goofy at times Venlil, that’s him. An entire galaxy’s worth of these beings was out there, billions with the Venlil alone and trillions accounting for all.

What if they attacked? One alone was a force to be reckoned with, but an army of thousands? I pictured them wielding truck-sized flamethrowers, torching our cities. Piles of ash and calcinated bodies being the only things left of our greatest achievements, while their technologically-superior ships crushed any hope of resistance… It was like our entire existence was some sort of twisted cosmic joke. We were both at a technological and complete physical disadvantage, in a galaxy where most would literally cheer our destruction! What the hell did we get into?!

One of his enormous eyes locked onto me, his stare alone made me feel like I was being pinned down by the weight of a mountain. His mouth opened shortly after, revealing a set of flat teeth big enough to munch on trees. He spoke, but I didn’t focus on what he said, even though it appeared to be directed at me. Back on Earth I was just a normal dude, slightly below average height but nothing I couldn’t deal with. Now I was no more significant than an insect, just him tripping over would mean the end of me, let alone if he tried to hurt me. What could I possibly try to do then? There’s nowhere to hide, nowhere to run, and overpowering him is an impossibility. If I or anyone I knew ever angered him then it would be over, just like that.

But he wouldn’t. He’s my friend, the same one that made me laugh with his goofy jokes and shared so many of my interests. I should be happy to meet him! Then why can’t I calm down?  Why am I so scared?!

 

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Vilsi, Venlil artist, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

He wasn’t saying anything. Was he shy? This was a big moment for us both after all! It wasn’t easy to tell his expression from this far away, his size along with the lack of a tail or movable ears certainly weren’t helping. He stood still as a stone, like his mind wandered off to an entirely different place, leaving his body behind as a little motionless statue. Maybe he didn’t hear me? Those ears looked pretty small after all, and I didn’t recall him clarifying if he had bad hearing. So I spoke again, this time making my voice a bit louder.

“Hey James. It’s nice to meet you!”

I let a few moments pass and… nothing. I would’ve expected some sort of reaction by now. But he stood frozen in time, focusing his tiny binocular eyes on me. He was behaving quite differently from what I was expecting, if our chats were anything to go by. It was almost like…

*Is he afraid of me?*

That wasn’t it, right? We Venlil weren’t a particularly menacing species, even to our smaller friends, and James even said he thought we looked cute! But still, something wasn’t right. I took a tentative step forward, his mind returned to his body as he took a step back, quickly raising his arms in a sort of defensive stance. This confused me for a moment, until the realization hit me like a train. That wasn’t excitement or joy, nor was it nervousness or shyness. It was absolute *terror*. My excitement turned to worry, and my ears pinned back against my head.

*Speh, how did I not think of that? Of course I look terrifying to him, I’m like at least ten times his size!*

His little body started to shake, enough for me to notice from where I was standing. He looked like he wanted to run to the other side of the planet and hide for eternity, never to be seen again. Just seeing him in that state made me want to vanish from the room right there and then. What if I ruin everything? Would his other friends react like this too?

I needed to do something. As much as I wanted to run away I couldn’t just abandon my friend like that. Ignoring one’s fears would allow them to fester, what would happen to him or our friendship after that I didn’t want to know. I carefully lowered myself to appear smaller, moving slowly so as not startle him. I forced my ears back to their natural position and softened my voice even more than I initially had.

“James… it’s me, Vilsi. It’s okay, you’re safe.”

He relaxed a bit, his arms leaving their defensive position, but he was still scared. I gave him a few moments to collect himself, then spoke again.

“I didn’t mean to scare you like that, I know I probably look… imposing to you. I’m an idiot for not realizing that. But I can assure you that I would never even dream of hurting you, you’re my friend, remember?”

He softened further, taking a series of deep breaths. His tiny mouth started to open.

“I-I’m sorry, I really d-don’t want to be s-scared of you.”

 

**Memory transcription subject:** ***James, Human Astrobiologist, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

I felt awful. Why couldn’t I calm down? He was apologizing for something that wasn’t his fault. If anything, I should be the one apologizing here. He was so excited, so happy, ready for the moment we had both anticipated and I just **had** to blow it. Worst part is, I was still afraid of him! I couldn’t let some primal instincts ruin this. He was my friend, and I had to show him that. I mustered all my courage, took in another long breath, and asked for the unthinkable.

“Could you c-come closer, p-please?” My voice still stuttered, despite my efforts.

His expression went from one of worry to one of both shock *and* worry in an instant. It took him a few seconds to even process what I had just said.

“Closer? Are you sure? You don’t need to force yourself to do this if you aren’t ready. I really don’t want to sca-”

“Just do it.” And with that, I closed my eyes.

After a moment of silence, the tremors returned as he no doubt started to approach me. His weight causing what to me felt like an earthquake. My heart was hammering against my chest, every instinct begged me to run, but I forced myself to stay. I focused on my breathing, one deep breath in, one deep breath out. I had to trust him, he wouldn’t let any harm come to me. The intensity rose, each tremor strong enough to shake my entire body, I started to lose control and my breathing quickened. Even through closed eyes I felt his shadow looming over me, a column of cold air rushed past as the shaking stopped.

That could only mean one thing, *he was right next to me.*

I looked down at James’ tiny figure. Fear was radiating off his body, he looked so fragile, so vulnerable, shuddering from my presence. He was pushing himself so hard and I couldn’t help but feel like ***I*** was the real predator here. I had to try something, *anything* to make him feel better, I thought about our conversations and got an idea.

I lowered my paws, carefully extending my digits around him. He wasn’t looking and so remained oblivious to what I was doing. I made contact, causing his eyes to snap open and immediately lock onto mine. I cupped him with both of my paws, forming a safe barrier to hold him steady in place. His weight was barely perceptible as I held him, but the warmth radiating off his body made me feel like I was holding the most precious thing in the world.

“P-please, just d-don’t hurt m-me” Came his shaky voice.

The way he said that broke me. Without a thought I pulled him into a hug, making sure he was surrounded by the wool in my chest, but still had enough space to breathe comfortably. I gently stroked his back with one of my digits, pushing his little body onto mine, letting my warmth envelop him. Whatever was scaring him so much probably ran deeper than me, and I needed to calm him down first if I wanted to find the source.

“There, there. You have nothing to worry about, you’re safe.”

He had picked me up like a toy, lifted me several meters into the air without so much as a grunt of effort, and there was no pain or discomfort in any of it. I couldn’t believe how gentle he was. He could’ve crushed me with a single squeeze, but I was instead embraced in the biggest hug I’ve ever received. His wool put any mattress or blanket to shame, it was *so soft*, I buried my face in it and the coldness of the room gave way to the natural warmth of his body. I felt his chest rise and fell with each breath, gently rocking me, the faint thumping of his heart sounding like a distant drum through it all. One of his fingers started caressing my back, the cold, hard texture of his claw sending a shiver down my spine when it briefly touched me.

*Is he… petting me?*

It was surreal. I was being held by a giant alien *and* being pet like a puppy, never in my life did I expect to experience anything so bizarre. The previously robust grip of my fear loosened at the absurdity of it, enough for me to relax a bit, giving me a hold of my breathing again. Even then, I couldn’t stop thinking about it. How easy it would’ve been for him to hurt me, one tight squeeze or a bit too much pressure is all it would take. If the entire galaxy was meant for beings this big, then what did that make us? Without thinking I instinctively leaned further into his wool, seeking it’s comfort. I stayed there for what felt like hours, suspended within the living cloud that was my friend as I thought about our new place in the universe. I looked up and saw Vilsi’s enormous head gazing down at me, the sheer scale of it partially reigniting my fears. But I shut them down and addressed him directly, finally being able to keep my voice steady.

“You… You really meant it, didn’t you?”

His ears twitched, the pressure from his finger becoming slightly stronger. His voice returned, soft and soothing.

“Of course I did. You’re very brave, you know that? I would’ve probably fainted in your place.” He let out a short, whistling laugh.

I chuckled, imagining how *that* would’ve played out. I was getting more comfortable with him, but although I wasn’t an expert in reading Venlil emotions, I could tell that he looked unsure about something.

“James, could you do something for me?”

“Sure.” I replied.

“Could you… lay down and close your eyes, please?” He asked in a tentative tone.

I wasn’t sure as to why he wanted me to do that. If anything, the specificity of the request made me a bit nervous, but I decided to trust him either way.

“Uh, sure.”

I lowered onto his palm and closed my eyes, the squishy texture of his pads feeling like a mattress. A few moments of silence went by until he spoke again.

“Try to relax. Control your breathing, focus on what you’re feeling right now.”

He wanted me to relax? I happily obliged. Deep breaths in, deep breaths out, just like before. After a while my heartbeat approached it’s normal rate, and my breathing neared his. It was peaceful, like getting home after a long workday. But even then, I figured that there was something else going on.

“Now, I want to ask you something. It’s going to be rough, but I want you to try and answer honestly. Please tell me if it’s too much and I’ll stop.”

Although I wished it wasn’t the case, I was almost certain that I knew what he was about to say.

“Alright, go ahead”

“James… Why are you so afraid of me?”

 

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Vilsi, Venlil artist, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

I felt him shudder. His breathing quickened, fear was taking ahold of him again. Did I push him too far? I quickly intervened.

“M-maybe I shouldn’t have asked that, I’m so sor-“

“No, no. It’s okay. You deserve to know.”

He took a deep breath, before exhaling and relaxing once more, eyes still closed. A few moments later, he spoke.

“Look, it’s not just you, it’s… all of it. Just over a month ago humanity was all I knew, we were the only sentient beings in the universe, Earth was the only planet with life, some very special stuff, y’know? Then we find a bunch of giant aliens who happen to hate us for something we can’t change, and turns out, there’s *another* species of giant aliens that literally want to murder everyone because they think we’re weak. Knowing that the federation and the Arxur are out there, how big you guys are, that humanity may one day be attacked… It’s just too much.”

His words were eerily familiar. They reminded me of one of my old guild mates, Rilo. That feeling of helplessness, of insignificance. Like the day he admitted to everyone that he wished he could’ve been born as anything other than a Dossur, even a predator if need be. Poor guy almost got diagnosed with PD right there and then. It was the first time I saw someone go through this, and the first time I sought to help.

“I understand. Tell me, how does that make you feel?”

“Scared. It makes me feel insignificant, helpless, like I have no control over anything.”

“And that fear, where do you feel it? Could you show me?”

He thought for a moment, before moving one of his hands around his torso. Eventually letting it rest on his sternum.

“Now focus on it, picture it as an object. Look at it’s color, which one is it?”

“It’s… red. Dark red, like blood.”

“And what shape does it have?”

He remained quiet for a moment.

“It’s… Spiky, like a sea urchin. A sphere with sharp spikes all around it.”

For a moment, I hesitated to continue. This part was always the hardest, but the earlier he went through this the better it would be in the long run.

“And why is it there? What scares you the most about it? Let it all out, don’t hold back.”

His body tensed. But he composed himself and pushed through.

“I… just can’t stop seeing It, already had a few bad nights because of it. What if we’re attacked? I picture fleets of ships hovering over a burning Earth, a debris field of destroyed UN ships and space stations around it. Exterminators or Arxur hunters making landfall and just… erasing us. Cities leveled, people running, screams piercing the air and the few survivors hiding as our entire history is forgotten. What could we do? Even just one of you is like a small army by themselves, but an entire fleet? What if we’re next?”

He took a break. His breathing quickening further, before he continued to spill his thoughts.

“And even if that doesn’t happen, what would become of us? What if no one takes us seriously, treats us like the galaxy’s little oddity? A species of “predators” so pathetic that even a Dossur could defeat barehanded and a Venlil could just step on. We’d be like a bunch of living jokes. Even now every part of me wants to think that you are a threat, I know you wouldn’t, but it’s hard to ignore how easy it would be for you to just… end me.”

I felt like his words tore a chunk of my heart away. I instinctively moved one of my digits on top of him, gently rubbing it around his stomach. He flinched at the touch, but no further words were needed to calm him down shortly after. Once he looked ready, I lifted it off and continued.

“Okay. With one of your paws, I want you to grab that fear, that spiky object. Pick it up, look at it well and take in it’s shape.”

He moved his paw towards his sternum. Closing it slowly as if carefully gripping something, before lifting it in front of his face and rotating it to get a good look at it.

“Now, move it away from you and release it.”

He slowly moved his arm up, before opening his paw. His head pointed to where it had been, as if looking at an object that was slowly floating away from him.

“We’re going to make something else to put in its place. I don’t want you to think about your fear of the worst, but instead your optimism for the best. Your hope for the future, a best-case scenario for humanity. Remember all those things you taught me? The way you make your cities accessible to *everyone*, no matter their condition? Your art, your culture? Think about all the things humanity could change for the better, what the galaxy could learn. How does that make you feel?”

He remained quiet for a while, deep in thought.

“I think it makes me feel hope… and a bit of pride.”

“Look at that hope, it’s color. Which one is it?”

“It’s… blue, a bright shiny blue. Like the sky on a clear summer day.”

“And what shape does it have?”

His head moved up, as if looking at something above him.

“Spherical, like a pearl. Almost perfectly smooth on all sides.”

“Now grab it, look at it well. Feel it’s smooth, shiny texture and place it where the fear was.”

His paws moved above him, closing as if grabbing a small, smooth object. He then lowered them towards his chest, before slowly releasing his grip. His breathing slowly returned to normal, and I gave him some time to think for himself.

“So, how do you feel? You can open your eyes now.”

His eyes met mine.

“Better... I think. I won’t lie, I’m still a bit scared, but I really needed that. Thank you.”

I placed my digit next to him again, carefully rubbing it around the top of his head.

“You’re welcome. Leaving those feelings unchecked can blind people, make them only focus on the worst that could happen. I’m sure that someday the galaxy will come to understand. I mean, you’ve already taught me quite a lot, haven’t you?”

He took a moment to think, before chuckling and gazing down at my pads.

“Hah, I guess I have.”

I took some time to think for myself. I had to admit, I wanted to visit some of Earth’s landscapes and cities someday. While that did mean being close to unchecked wild predator populations, James’ size showed me that I probably didn’t have anything to fear. It would be hard to find an appropriate portion size for some of their “vegan” foods, however, or really any accommodations. But I wouldn’t put it beyond humans to find a way, so long as it didn’t involve any... *flesh*. Some aspects of their culture were still scary, but they had a level of diversity and creativity that put entire species to shame, especially with how common and unregulated human art was. My favorite probably had to be their music, from what little James had shown it was incredibly diverse. Some of their pieces were soothing melodies that could put an energetic pup to sleep, while others consisted of distorted screaming accompanied by booming instruments that would get you sent to a PD facility before your eardrums could rupture from all the noise.

James stood up, binocular eyes locked onto my digit which was still resting next to him. A mischievous look took ahold of his face as he started to... snarl?

*Wait no, that’s a “smile”. That means he’s happy, I think.*

I noticed a new peculiar detail about him, that being his teeth. There were fangs, yes, but only four which were far smaller than I expected, with the rest being flat prey-like teeth. I tried to get a better look at them, something which was quickly interrupted by him speaking.

“So, Vilsi. Are you ready?”

“Huh? Ready? For what?”

“For a surprise hug attack!”

He jumped on top of my digit, wrapping his body around it. I was caught off guard, momentarily flinching before remembering our little exchange from back when the program started. I still couldn’t believe how scared I was, it took him a few days just to convince me that he wouldn’t bite me whenever we met, something which was funny in retrospect after seeing his unremarkable teeth. I looked down at him, the sight making my heart melt as he struggled to hold onto my comparatively enormous digit, hugging it tightly enough for me to feel some pressure on it.

*Stars, he’s adorable.*

“Man, are all venlil this soft or are you some sort of exception? I feel like I’m hugging a pillow right now.”

I felt a blush spreading around my face, followed by a rumble building in my chest, strong enough to rattle James’ body. I tried to suppress it, but my efforts were in vain as he noticed and looked up at me in awe.

“No way! You guys can purr? You’re like the world’s biggest kitten, that’s so cute!” His grip around my digit tightened, as he started rubbing his face against it.

The amount of embarrassment I felt was hard to describe. I needed to get one back at him, and quickly. I remembered a bizarre human show of affection he had discussed, and so I decided to try it out without warning him. I moved my snout downwards, stopping just a few \[meters\] away from him. His grip loosened as he looked at me, confused.

“Vilsi… W-what are you doing?”

I pushed my snout forward, effortlessly dislodging him from my digit and pinning his body against my pads. I then let a bit of my tongue out for good measure, in an attempt to replicate a human “kiss”. I still thought the gesture was very strange, but I could certainly see the appeal. He struggled to break free, trying in vain to push me away until I allowed him to. He then looked at me, dazed, his “clothes” now drenched. It really took everything within me to not burst out laughing at the sight.

“O-oh, sweet Jesus. That… was a lot to take in. Couldn’t contain yourself, could ya?”

*“Jesus""?  Whatever, doesn’t matter right now.*

I noticed a tiny blush forming across his face, but he also started to shiver. I worried for a moment, but then remembered he had almost no insulating fur to speak of. What I did probably made him more susceptible to the cold air of the room. So I picked up my now drenched friend and brought him up to my snout, opening my mouth as to let my warm breath wash over him. He stopped shivering shortly after, to my relief.

“…I, uh, got carried away. Sorry.”

He looked at me disapprovingly, still drenched.

“Yeah, no kidding. Ya probably just set the world record for the biggest kiss ever with that one. Appreciate the warmth but I think I gotta go shower now, else I’ll be smelling like Venlil saliva for the next few days. Also, I wanna get some rest. I think I’ve been up for like, almost \[7 claws\] now?”

Seven claws!? He did mention that humans had better endurance than us, but to have *this* much energy after ***seven*** claws sounded almost impossible. He didn’t even sound sleepy!

“How the Speh are you still awake!?”

He looked at me smugly, leaning against the digit he was previously clinging to.

“Coffee, and a lot of spirit.”

\[Time skip: 45 minutes\]

I stepped out of the shower and into the living area, few things could beat a hot shower on a cold day. My habitat was like a sort of “portable” room located in the corner of the main exchange room, essentially a climate-controlled metal cube with windows on it. It contained a queen-sized bed, a bathroom, a kitchen and a few other accommodations. The whole thing was specifically designed to handle a hundred-ton Venlil accidentally falling on it, which while unlikely, was a possibility.

I put on my pajamas and chatted with my friends, talking about our sub-optimal initial meeting. I didn’t go into much detail since I could already feel the caffeine starting to wear off, meaning Morpheus would soon take ahold of me. I opened the habitat windows, getting a worm’s eye view of Vilsi lying on his bed, distracted by his enormous holopad. He was lying on his belly, the side profile of his body showing that it was… certainly optimized to deal with high gravity. I cast a glance towards my own queen-sized bed, which after what I had experienced, seemed like the worst out of two options. I made my way towards the habitat’s main door, stepping outside into the cold room and raising my voice enough for him to hear. He had already noticed me, aiming an ear in my direction. Having a wide field of vision did have it’s benefits after all.

“Oh, hey… Cleaned up?” He asked, still embarrassed over what happened earlier.

“Yeah, much better. Could you come here real quick?”

He stepped out of his bed. It was still terrifying to see him approach, especially as the ground shook with each step. Still, I handled it much better than I would’ve initially. I looked up at him, before asking the big question.

“Say, do you mind if I sleep on you tonight?”

His ears perked up in surprise, and a slight blush appeared on his face.

“You want to… sleep on me? Like, literally on me?”

“I mean, yeah. You do make for a very comfortable bed, if I’m being honest. And I know damn well you wanted to do that already. You aren’t exactly subtle.”

He turned a deeper shade of orange and then lowered himself, placing his palms on the ground. I climbed on top and was lifted to a panoramic view of the entire room. He walked the “short” distance to his bed, before slowly lying down and depositing me in my new sleeping spot, right below his neck. The familiar warmth of his body along with his soft wool making me feel like I was peacefully floating in the sky. Unsurprisingly, his fingers arrived to give me a full-body massage shortly after.

*Yup, I’m definitely claiming him as my personal bed from now on.*

 

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Vilsi, Venlil artist, Human-Venlil Exchange participant***

“Comfortable?” I asked, my digits running over his entire body.

“Dude, you have no idea. I almost feel bad that you can’t experience this.""

Even though I *really* wanted to continue without further thought, I was a bit concerned. I could tell he would fall asleep soon, and while I wasn’t really the kind to move much while I slept, weighing over a thousand times more than him did spark a bit of worry.

“Uh, James?”

He opened his now sleepy eyes and gazed at me. He really looked like he was about to pass out at any moment.

“Y..yeah?” He said, with a sleepy tone.

“I don’t wanna ruin the moment, but are you sure this is a good idea? I really wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I accidentally rolled over and squished you while I slept or something.”

He let out a weak grunt, before addressing me.

“Nah. It’s hard for me to fall off here, y’know? And even if I did, I’m pretty sure you’ve got way more than enough padding down there for me to survive.”

“Padding? What do you mean?”

I was about to repeat myself before I realized he had already fallen asleep. He must’ve been really tired, even human endurance had it’s limits after all. I looked down at him, peacefully resting on top of me. I thought about what the future would hold for us. It would take a while for the rest of the galaxy to accept humanity, and many people’s worldviews would be challenged in the process, much like mine. Still, I still held hope for the future, especially with all of what I had to learn.

I took a moment to dwell on what he last said, something about me having “padding”…?

I just had a strange interaction on WhatsApp, and I’m trying to figure out if it’s a scam or just an innocent mistake. Here’s what happened:

Someone named “Elena” messaged me, thinking I was someone named James. I told her she had the wrong number, and she apologized, saying it was an embarrassing mistake. The conversation started casual but friendly.

She mentioned she’s in London (like me) but traveling to Manchester tomorrow. Then, the tone changed—she started saying I’m nice, that I made her smile, and even offered to meet for coffee as a way to “make up for her mistake.” She insisted it’d be her treat.

I politely declined, but it felt weird. I’ve heard of scams starting with friendly messages like this, but I’m not sure where this could lead if it’s a scam.

1i92qrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1i92qrq/feeling_lost_and_broken/,Feeling lost and broken,"I woke up this morning still feeling like dog shit.

It's been weeks since I saw it.

I was crying on the way back home.

I was crying just now. Before even touching my coffee.

Thinking about that girl, that photo, seeing it on his phone.

An erotic and provocative picture of another women saved on his phone. 

Thinking about the moment he first saw her post, clicked on it, the thoughts and feelings he was having, and the thoughts that led to his decision to take a screenshot of it. 

We were together when he did that. And if we happened to be fighting or on the outs, we knew how much we loved each other and supposedly respected each other. We were supposedly in love with each other. How could he do that if he really loved me? How could he do that if he respected me?

This picture looked as if she had taken it herself and sent it to him.

That was my first thought when he swiped to it in his phone gallery for both of us to see and take in.

No...

My first thought was he’s cheating on me, because I didn’t know yet that it was a screenshot of an instagram post.

I thought it was a photo a woman had sent to him via messaging.

How long has he been cheating on me?

How long has he been talking to her?

Did she send this to him today?
It was among recent photos, so I knew it was during our relationship.

How does he know this woman?! I’m going to explode, fall apart, or wither into nothing.

Am I ever going to have a faithful man??

It looked personal to me. It looked intimate, and very provocative. The image is seared into my brain and won’t go away.

These thoughts and feelings of betrayal and pain flood.

Another thought. What if he fantasized that he was with her and she had sent this to him?

Speaking of. I have to live with the fact that he was fantasizing what he wanted to do to her. He imagined having sex with her. He imagined having his hands all over her body. Touching her. Thinking of the places he wanted to do things to. Kissing her. Being inside her. Among other things unfortunately, maybe imaging how she feels inside, or the sounds she probably makes when she’s moaning or screaming. Maybe they were more intimate thoughts? More like, caressing her, telling her sweet things, making love to her, having her in his life.

She looked nothing like me. She was so sexy, beautiful and perfect in her lingerie. I was immediately jealous that she caught the attention of “my man” out of a crowd of pictures and posts, and I was jealous that I didn’t look like her. Even jealous that I didn’t look like her to get that sort of attention from him.

He doesn’t want me. He settled, and she is what he really wants, or at least someone that looks like her. 

I thought of her as his perfect ideal lover and how he wants her to look.

I think, if I was his ideal lover, he would have been looking at my picture and screenshotting it to his phone. 

I think, if he really loved me and if I was really “the one”, he would have scrolled past her.

He would have seen it, but averted his thoughts to me. 

I need to know if my thoughts are accurate.

I need to know if I’m “the one” or not. 

(I experienced ALL of this. I felt the pain and flood of emotions. I felt every thought and every word you just read. It was real for me. No matter what he says, the explanations of his experience. My heart still broke. My image and beliefs I had for him that I loved and provided me with security and safety were shattered to pieces, and left me feeling lost and broken.)

*** It's important to know that the pain, feelings, thoughts repeatedly come back whether or not I am going about my day, or taking time to process this and grieve. What you're reading up above, was not the only time I experienced that in my head since it happened, and it's not always within my control to stop it or prevent it from happening. It's a daily battle that I have to live with for now. 

To him:  I would love to just erase my experience and take in yours so that it wouldn't be as painful. I would love to just chalk it up to ""remnants of p*** brain cuz you were single for so long"". But I had to find out the way that I did, you didn't even take care of me in that moment. It made me feel worthless to you, like what I just saw was something you held higher than our relationship, more important than my feelings. And NOTHING can change that. And nothing can change how wrong it was to give another woman that attention AND save her on your phone when you were telling me that you love me and you only have eyes for me. Now I have to experience betrayal trauma all over again. I have to grieve and process, and there's no way out of it but through it. I have to live with this pain, those thoughts and doubts, that image in my head, and the emotions. The emotions! I am a sensitive and emotional person, on top of being an overthinker. Do you have any idea the rollercoaster you put me on??? And I'm just supposed to believe and trust that eventually I'm going to feel restored and healed, ready to have that type of trust with someone again?

TL;DR: My experience and thoughts of what happened. I share my thought process and hope to receive some answers or support.

*August 27, 2025*

Following the incident at that bar, my night’s remainder bled into early morning without any more occurrences of note, leaving me plenty of time to acclimate myself to the usage of my phone. Accessing the small application depicting a ring of three colors, I was presented with a mostly blank screen bearing a colorful, yet seemingly meaningless word and a small bar above it labeled ‘type here’. With the sum of human knowledge now at my disposal, I figured it’d be best to use the hours of quiet to do some research.

Perching myself atop a small building and connecting my device to its wireless fidelity (or ‘wi-fi’) network, I sifted through my recent memory for any gaps in knowledge I could resolve. Almost immediately, one particular term came to mind. Tapping on the search bar and typing in the word I’d repeatedly referenced in regards to myself, I selected the first text link I saw and was guided to a webpage. Apparently, the ‘Amish’ were a group of traditionalist ‘Christians’ (another word I hadn’t a clue about) who rejected more recent technologies in favor of a more simplistic lifestyle. Setting aside for a moment the various controversies listed, I immediately moved on to that next term I did not recognize.

*“What are Christians?”* Again, I was met with a treasure trove of knowledge regarding a group of humans who placed supernatural significance upon a human who by some accounts returned from the dead due to being the child of an entity called ‘God’. The river of searches continued to flow as I found myself engrossed in the cascade of questions followed by answers like the crests and troughs of a wave. 

*“Who is God?”*

*“What is God?”*

*“Where to find God?”*

*“Is God real?”*

*“Atheism.”*

With each new piece of information I obtained on the humans to resolve one question, a hundred more seemed to take its place. Especially curious to me was the notion of a creator: a divine entity responsible for mankind’s existence. As far as human ‘pastors’ said, individual humans were created with a purpose. Perhaps this was mere wishful thinking on their part or perhaps it was something more, but nevertheless I found myself deeply pondering this notion. If humans had a divine purpose, then was the same true for me? I did have some kind of ordained directive, then what was it? Taking note of paths yet untraveled, I selected one at a time and moved on through the web. 

*“Humans.”* Though I had seen the species referred to by this word, I nevertheless wanted to understand that they knew about themselves. Apparently, humans belonged to a collection of clades, including ‘great apes’, ‘mammals’ and most broadly ‘animals’. Like all great apes, they were a sexually dimorphic species, with two primary sexual ‘morphs’. Male humans were the often larger and more muscular ones, while females tended to be smaller and had protrusions on the chest called ‘breasts’. From this, I deduced the Soft One to be a female. Apparently, the split between male and female humans was roughly fifty-fifty, but due to certain societal pressures they often assumed different currency-producing roles, which explained their relative rarity within the laboratory I had initially woken up in. 

Continuing my research on human anatomy, I discovered a variety of curious details. As both male and female gametes were required for them to reproduce, humans often sought out life-mates through intensely complicated rituals the likes of which I could not make heads or tails of. Fortunately, there was no shortage of available material on the topic of reproductive acts, with meticulous diagrams and documentation available on a wide variety of sites. Clearly, the humans valued reproduction very highly, given the amount of studying they did on the topic. 

For hours, I wracked my cells in search of any familiar, yet-undefined terms that could possibly turn up useful information. Thinking back, I recalled one of the evil ones referencing me as a ‘skinwalker’, which seemed as good a place as any to start digging another internet rabbit hole.

*“What is a skinwalker?”* While details regarding their exact mode of existence were inconsistent at best, what did seem relatively shared among conflicting reports was that they were animalistic entities which hunted humans by mimicking their voices and appearance. Given the stunt I had pulled back at the lab, this was an apt comparison. Fortunately, most reports I came upon seemed to describe these creatures as ‘fictional’, which meant ‘not-real’. That being said, reports of ‘sightings’ didn’t exactly *reassure* me as to this classification, so I spent about an hour after the fact researching how to kill them. 

I must have gone on dozens of similar-caliber tangents before eventually arriving back at the more pertinent questions. *“Life beyond Earth.”* Whatever I was, it was clear that I did not originate from this planet. Perhaps, I reasoned at the time, the humans might have some prior experience with alien entities. Unfortunately, this search turned up very little of note. After watching a few videos on the subject, I came to the conclusion that humans had no concrete proof of alien existence, let alone knowledge of creatures like me. 

Vehicles driving along the road beneath my secluded spot hummed in a monotonous, yet increasingly frequent rhythm as I typed feverishly my next query. “University ohio quarantine”. This combination of key words was sufficient to guide me to an article. Just as I had predicted, the circumstances described lined up almost perfectly with the suited ones’ arrival and my subsequent relocation. What immediately caught my attention about this article, however, was the list of names and accompanying pictures at the bottom. *Could this be?* Scrolling down just a little bit further, I saw the soft one’s face looking back at me. Though it was merely a digital replica, the sight of her face nevertheless sent an involuntary tickle of excitement throughout my system as I relived the fond memories of her, followed shortly thereafter by an internal storm of guilt and anger as I recalled her being taken away. Alongside her image was a name—or, more accurately, two names: Jane Stern. “Jane Stern…” I murmured those words aloud, testing the taste of the soft one’s true moniker upon my tongue. This newfound knowledge of the soft one reignited the fires of urgency within me. I *had* to find her. To rescue her from the suited ones. 

Lacking a vehicle of my own to use, it seemed that my best bet for making it to the next destination was to hitch a ride with some humans. That being said, I doubted I’d come upon someone by chance who was willing to let me tag along. Accessing one of the humans’ ‘social media’ applications, I captured an image of myself and uploaded it alongside a few lines of text. *“Hello everyone! My name is Sam. I am looking for a ride to Minneapolis. If anyone is headed out that way, I would be delighted if they could let me come with them.”*

I’m not sure how quickly I *expected* to get a response, but it most certainly wasn’t longer than the two hours I spent essentially just staring at the screen as my phone’s battery dwindled. “I should plug this in…” I told myself, hopping down from the roof to search for an outlet. Exiting the alleyway and peering in through this building’s mostly-glass front face, I was taken aback slightly by how many humans had found their way inside. The place was dark and empty when I first scaled the rooftop, but after a mere few hours it had come alive, hosting at least a dozen humans. Stepping inside to the mildly-startling jingle of an overhead bell before approaching the near corner and plugging my phone into an unused outlet, I took a seat at the closest table and allowed myself a moment of rest. 

Focusing on my deposited biomass, I was well pleased to discover how quickly it had managed to spread through the sewer. Even at a leisurely pace, my spare cells had already multiplied to populate a significant portion of the underground area, leaving me with enough biomass to repair myself dozens of times over should the need arise. Clearly, I wouldn’t be able to take it all with me, so I decided then and there that I would leave this culture of myself in Fargo. If for whatever reason I had business in this city again, then ‘arriving’ here would be a simple matter of forming a new body. 

Each time the entrance bell jingled, I looked up to see who had come or gone. Most of these individuals were not of note, cut from the same cloth as those who walked the streets. Feeling a tad low on hydration, I ordered a large glass of water to sip from as I lazily surveyed the humans around me. One human in particular caught my eye upon entry due to their blue uniform, gleaming metal badge, and the presence of a weapon holstered at their hip. “Good morning, Officer!” Smiled another patron as they passed him by on their way out.

*Curious…* I did not understand why this figure had a weapon, nor why the others seemed to regard him with additional courtesy. Pulling out my phone’s search engine and typing in ‘officer in blue’, I found many pictures of humans wearing near-similar uniforms. Apparently, these ‘police officers’ were tasked with enforcing the rules handed down by a governing body. Much like their biology, human society seemed to be strongly hierarchical. Digging a little bit further, I learned that human civilization was separated into ‘countries’, with each one having its own laws and customs. If one were to compare the nation I found myself in to a human body, then this ‘police officer’ was like a white blood cell, protecting it against harmful agents. *Why is he here, though?*

The presence of active immune cells usually implied the detection of something they were needed for. Looking around this ‘coffee shop’, I could think of only one individual who truly didn’t belong: *me*. At first, the officer seemed to ignore my presence altogether, just like the rest. Approaching the front counter, he ordered a cup of steaming brown liquid and a round pastry with a hole in it. However, upon retrieving his things, the officer turned around and began approaching the table where I sat. 

“Mind if I join you, son?” He asked kindly, pulling out the chair across from me in anticipation of my response. Doing my best to remain nonchalant in the face of this potential threat, it took genuine effort to prevent my skin from literally crawling with unease as I shrugged and allowed him to take a seat. Judging by the weapon he carried, this little cell was by no means equipped to deal with me on his own, but that did not mean he couldn’t alert the rest of the immune system.

“What brings you here, Officer?” I asked, carefully repeating the title I’d recently learned as a show of respect. My tone was calm, but beneath the table, my fingers twitched, ready to react if he reached for the weapon at his hip.

The officer raised his cup of steaming brown liquid to his lips, the faint scent of bitterness wafting over the table as he took a sip. “Just grabbing my morning coffee—same as always,” he replied casually, though his sharp gaze lingered on me a moment longer than I liked. “Can’t say I’ve seen you around before. You from Fargo?”

“Not even close!” I said, forcing an easy chuckle and flashing what I hoped passed for a friendly smile. Taking a long gulp of water, I gave myself a moment to collect my thoughts. “I’m just passing through.”

His brows lifted slightly, a flicker of curiosity crossing his face before his expression settled back into its default friendliness. “We don’t get a lot of passersby up here. Where are you headed?”

“Minneapolis,” I said, keeping my tone light. “I’m on my way to New York, actually. My parents are Amish, though, so I don’t own a car.”

“Ah, that explains it,” he said, nodding knowingly as he leaned back in his chair. “It’s not every day you meet someone traveling like that. Have you considered taking the bus?”

I blinked at him, genuinely caught off guard by this recommendation. “A bus?” 

“Yeah,” he said, pulling out his phone and tapping at the screen. “There’s one leaving today at nine o’clock.” He turned the screen toward me, crumbs from his half-eaten pastry falling onto the table as he spoke. “Tickets are fifty bucks. Not a bad deal.”

I leaned forward, scanning the screen with wide eyes. Fifty dollars. I could be in Minneapolis before sunset. “Where do I get a ticket?” I asked, the excitement in my voice almost slipping past my carefully crafted persona.

“At the station, but you won’t make it in time on foot,” he said, slipping his phone back into his pocket. “Tell you what—I’ll give you a ride. It’s on my way.”

For a moment, I hesitated. His offer was generous—perhaps too generous. Was he genuinely trying to help, or was he curious enough to keep tabs on me? Either way, refusing might raise more suspicion than it was worth. “That would be fantastic,” I said, standing and draining the rest of my water.

The officer smiled, tossing the last bite of his pastry into his mouth as he stood. “Come on, then. Let’s get you on your way.”

Following him outside, I climbed into his vehicle, noting the strange, colorful lights mounted on its roof. As he started the engine, a voice crackled faintly over his radio, blending with the hum of the car.

The ride was uneventful, but as we passed the bar I had visited the night before, my cells tensed and writhed anxiously. Two unmarked black vans sat parked outside, their presence too deliberate to be coincidental. Shrinking into my seat, I hoped beyond hope that they wouldn’t catch up with me before I left Fargo.

Finally, the officer pulled up in front of the bus station. The clock on the dashboard read ‘8:22.’ I didn’t have much time.

“Thank you very much, Officer,” I said, meeting his kind gaze with a genuine smile.

“No problem,” he replied, unlocking the passenger door. “Safe travels, son.”

As I stepped out and shut the door, I watched him drive off, the colorful lights on his roof disappearing around the corner. Brief though our encounter was, I found myself silently grateful for his kindness. Without him, the suited ones might have already caught up to me.

Rushing inside, I purchased my ticket with minutes to spare and made my way to the departure area. As the bus rolled into view and opened its doors, I climbed aboard, feeling a cautious sense of relief. For now, I was one step closer to the soft one—and one step further from the suited ones.",25,1737744334.0,HFY,11,0.97,False

Can’t you just buy a vanilla biscotti, madelines, vanilla bean scone, a short coffee, or even dream bar and technically you’re now a paying customer? At least this is what we’ve been telling some of the homeless who frequent our store…

My store has also agreed to giving out tall ice waters and short hot waters to any customer who asks, and filling personal cups with water. Regardless if they pay or not, but if they don’t want to buy anything they can’t stay in our store.

We had our meeting and pretty much decided water is a human right and no one needs to actually spend a lot to stay. We are a high incident store and are happy they’re putting practices in place to help us, but have found a way to shape the rules to accommodate our safety along with staying pretty in line with the the Bux wants from us.",48,1737744184.0,starbucks,50,0.85,False
1i92n2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1i92n2n/housekeeping_accidentally_took_two_of_my_deceased/,Housekeeping accidentally took two of my deceased daughter’s blankets and only gave one back.,"I stayed at a resort in key largo January 5th-January 14th and the night before we left the housekeepers accidentally took two blankets of my deceased daughters while they were cleaning the room. This is an email I wrote to the management a couple days after we were home that explains the whole situation. I also contacted the ceo of Hilton via email the day after we got home which is why the lady called my husband about the blanket in the first place.  Is there any legal action I can take? Obviously above anything I just want my daughter's blanket back I can't even explain the hole it is left in my heart it's like loosing a piece of her all over again. I just feel if they had of taken it serious in the first place I would have it they found one of them and they were literally together on my bed when they accidentally took them with the sheets.

My husband was contacted by someone today who asked him if we wanted them to send some money to replace the blanket or if we wanted to send a picture so they could replace it.  My husband explained to the lady that the blanket was not replaceable as it was my deceased daughters, the lady apologized and said she had no idea of the situation and asked us to send them a picture of the blanket.  I will attach it to this email, I have only one picture of the blanket because it was the blanket my daughter was wrapped in at her Funeral.  This blanket is NOT JUST MY CHILDS BLANKET!  This blanket is one of the ONIY two things I have of my deceased child!  My room got cleaned around 4:30pm on Monday 1/13/25 my daughter and I sat on the the stairs outside the room while it was being cleaned, I noticed the blanket gone that night when we were going to bed after we went to dinner and hung out outside together on our last night there.  I went down to the front I explained to the front lady and the security guard the sentimental value of my blankets I explained my daughter passed away this is all I have of her, the security guard told me laundry staff was already gone and he did not have a key and the laundry room was locked.  I told him I would personally look through all the laundry myself if I could just get in there and I was told there was no way he could get in.  He told me a laundry truck came at 5am for the laundry and the lady in the front took the information and they both said they would make sure the laundry staff knew before the laundry left and they would look for the blankets.  I went down that next morning 1/14/25 and the lady in the front had no clue what I was talking about so I explained to her the situation and the sentimental value of the blankets, she checked and said they had only found one of the two blankets and handed it back to me, she assured me they were just still looking for it and would contact me when they found it, I never heard from them so I went back down on our way to get coffee about an hour later and the lady said they didn’t find it.  I never heard from them so when I was leaving around 1030 I went back down and there was a different lady who had no idea what I was talking about, she said laundry told her I had a do not disturb sign on the door and they never cleaned the room, I told her that wasn’t true and they had given me back one of the blankets that morning and she looked surprised and checked with laundry but said they still didn’t find it.  I asked her how they could still be looking for it if laundry went off of the premises at 5am.  The lady told me that wasn’t true the laundry never leaves the resort and they were still looking for it and they would contact me
When it was found.  I called the resort the next morning on 1/15/25 and talked to the lady at the front desk she didn’t know what I was talking. About so I explained to her the situation and once again the sentimental value of the blanket and she said she would call back when she talked to laundry staff.  I got a call back that night from another front end lady who said she talked to laundry management and they did not find the blanket, she asked if I had taken the blanket out of my room somewhere (which I did not ever, I sleep with those blankets every night and they always stay next to my bed)  she also said laundry said there was a do not disturb sign on the door and they didn’t clean my room, i explained to her this was not true they cleaned it Monday and gave me
One of the blankets back on Tuesday morning, she sounded a bit shocked that I had been given back a blanket and had no clue there had been two missing.  she then said what kind of blanket is this like a soft pink one, she also had no clue of the situation or the sentimental value of this blanket so I explained the situation to her.   She apologized said she now understood the situation and would get back to me.  I didn’t hear from anyone again until reaching out to Hilton.  This blanket was with the blanket they gave back to me, this blanket was clearly never looked for properly and no one ever relayed the message of the sentimental value of this blanket, I do understand that mistakes happen but this could have easily been found the night I went down after I found the blankets missing and it should have been found the next morning when laundry staff came in before the laundry went anywhere.  I can not ever replace this blanket, and there is no monetary value of this blanket. 
I hope this matter gets resolved.

1i92l5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1i92l5k/montreal_vs_toronto/,Montreal vs Toronto,"Hi everyone,

My partner and I are deciding between moving to Toronto or Montreal and would love some insights, especially from those who’ve lived in both cities. We’re particularly curious to hear from Ontarians (especially those who aren't fluent in French) who’ve experienced life in both places but happy to hear from anyone who has lived in both MTL + TO.

Feel free to share whatever you think is important, but here are some specific questions I have:

* **How do you feel the overall quality of life compares between Toronto and Montreal?**
* **What are the biggest HEADACHES about living in Montreal? I want to be realistic and know what the challenges are and what to be expecting.**
* **How significant is the language barrier for non-French speakers living in Montreal?**
* **Aside from rent, how does the cost of living in Montreal compare to Toronto (groceries, dining out, shopping, etc.)?**
* **For those who moved from Montreal to Toronto (or vice versa), what do you feel are the biggest differences?**
* **Are there any other factors you think we should consider when deciding between the two cities?**
* **What’s the general vibe of the creative community in Montreal compared to Toronto? Is there more support for freelancers in either city?** My partner and I are photographers, we love the fashion world, bookstores, coffee shops, running, interior design, etc. In Paris, we found it was very easy to meet and connect with people and they were quite up for meeting for a coffee or dinner. We'd like to do more photo work in MTL and I'm curious if it's very cliquey or if people help each other out, enjoy collaborating together, etc.

**Additional questions:**

* **What’s the job market like for freelancers or people in creative industries (photographers, designers, etc.)?**
* **What’s the general pace of life in both cities, in terms of work-life balance and social activities? Is one city more laid-back than the other?**
* **How does the weather in Montreal affect your daily life? I’ve heard winters are really long and harsh... Are people exaggerating or not really? How do people cope with the cold?**
* **Is either city more or less dog friendly?**

Thanks sooo much for your input!

For more context about us: We are M+F in our early 30s, we spent the last two years living in France, and we absolutely loved it. The only reason we moved back is Visa reasons. We aren't fluent in French, but know the basics and had a very easy time adapting to the culture in France and doing day-to-day tasks like ordering food or greeting people, and most people were very friendly and accommodating when we needed to switch to English. There were occasional challenges, like phone calls or specific situations, but overall, we had a really great quality of life despite the language barrier.

When I compare my quality of life in Ontario vs Paris, France... France wins, no questions asked. For every challenge we faced, we had 10x more reasons to be happy and grateful. And we were working and traveling quite a lot so we didn't have a lot of time to devote to language studies, it's not something I'm particularly proud of and we didn't not learn because we don't think it's not necessary. If we ever moved back to France and wanted to stay there more permanently, we would sign up for language intensive courses.  

Since we came back to Canada, we have been working for clients online, and we will continue to do this wherever we go, unless one of us or either of us got a FT offer in Toronto (don't think we'd get FT jobs in MTL due to lack of fluency). Toronto seemed like the logical choice since we’re from Ontario—we have friends & family here, and no need to deal with things like switching health cards or driver’s licenses, filing taxes from another province, etc... However, the cost of renting in Toronto is staggering. We are both currently freelancers and the only reason I could see us moving to Toronto is if either of us got a good FT job w/Salary there. Otherwise, with our current income, Montreal seems much more affordable, especially because we could find a place for literally half the rent of what we'd pay in Toronto. But we’re wondering how the two cities compare in other areas like groceries, eating out, and shopping.

tldr: my roommate is annoying. she purposely does things to get me to react, listens to my calls, is constantly spying on me, is condescending. BUT, she can be nice when she wants to as long it’s on her terms. i’m incredibly optimistic and obviously naive but i hope for a better future. 

### 

my roommate is difficult but i’m naively optimistic.

we’ve been living together for over a year now, and it’s been a journey so far. there are times when i’m like yeah, she’s not bad and that this could be the start of a great friendship. but, most times, her energy is distant, hot and cold,  moody, in which i’m often on the receiving end of. recently, she’s gotten sneaky, making underhanded comments, hovering over me in the kitchen while i cook; she’s truly becoming insufferable.

here are some things she’s done:

-hover over me in the kitchen; when she’s in there (all day sometimes) i give her that space to herself. she’ll sit on the couch for hours or be in her room all day, and the moment i go into the kitchen, she decides it her to time to cook. she’ll even prepare her dog’s (black lab) right next to my food. i hate cooking when she’s home bc she literally spies on me while I cook. 

-she’ll rewipe the kitchen counters after i wipe them down and then make a big spectacle by dumping the “leftover crumbs” in the sink. there are never any bc i just wiped the counter down. 

-she listens to my calls; i always catch her turning off her tv or trying to get close to me so she can listen.

-she brought in a stray cat w/o my consent.
-she offered me cans of iced coffee (12) bc she was giving them away and when i took two, she hid the remaining. 

-our dryer was messed up and she (tried) gaslit me into thinking nothing was wrong but she knew it was broken, she was just using a separate setting.

-i broke half the lamps’ nozzle off (it still worked) and went to get glue to fix it, which she was ok with and happy that i was going to fix. when i came back, she removed the entire nozzle piece and put the lamp in our donation bin.

-her dog loves me which she hates, so she’ll literally try to limit our interactions together going as far as picking the dog up so it cant play with me

-when i come in, i always say hi. manners, right? she’ll look at me and mumble it back or put her headphones in or even start stretching which is her sign she doesn’t want to speak. 

-she has the habit of keeping the halfway light on at all times with the exception of bedtime. i’ll turn out the light because why does it need to be on all the time and she’ll be in her room, door closed and turn the light on then go back into room and close the door.

-she hates when i cook in the morning and I don’t turn the lights on; she’ll get upset and turn them on for me.

-she uses the dishwasher EVERY night and empties the trash every day and gets mad at me bc i often tell her that’s wasteful

-when i’m in the living room she’ll keep her door open or workout in the hallway so she can listen to me.

The only time I’ve gone on a date, I messed up (lol I think I did but I don’t regret it as such) and said 50/50 ON COFFEE lmao that guy ghosted me after.

I see a lot of gay men on Tik Tok saying “oh, he should be paying for everything” but, aren’t you both a ‘he’ if you are gay MEN? I don’t know how it’d be with genderfluid/non-binary peeps though.

As my, very straight, friend said “quien paga, la mete”, which translates into english as “who pays, puts it (🍆) in”.

This past week I tried to have coffee again; it went well until the second day after I had probably 2 cups. Still trying to figure out of I was just dehydrated, had too much too soon, or if it i really just can’t have caffeine itself—but I had two debilitating TCs and scared of trying it again. 

I already found tea & matcha had the same effect when I decided to cut out caffeine this past. The only reason I’m struggling is, I can’t say it’s been manageable to feel like a nonfunctional zombie. I drank coffee for 8 years with little problem.

Do you all keep it to one cup or have caffeine at a certain time of day?

It's been weeks since I saw it.

I was crying on the way back home.

I was crying just now. Before even touching my coffee.

Thinking about that girl, that photo, seeing it on his phone.

Am erotic picture of another women saved on his phone.

Thinking about the moment he first saw her post, clicked on it, the thoughts and feelings he was having, and the thoughts that led to his decision to take a screenshot of it. 

We were together when he did that. And if we happened to be fighting or on the outs, we knew how much we loved each other and supposedly respected each other. We were supposedly in love with each other. How could he do that if he really loved me? How could he do that if he respected me?

This picture looked as if she had taken it herself and sent it to him.

That was my first thought when he swiped to it in his phone gallery for both of us to see and take in.

No...

My first thought was he’s cheating on me, because I didn’t know yet that it was a screenshot of an instagram post.

I thought it was a photo a woman had sent to him via messaging.

How long has he been cheating on me?

How long has he been talking to her?

Did she send this to him today?
It was among recent photos, so I knew it was during our relationship.

How does he know this woman?! I’m going to explode, fall apart, wither into nothing.

Am I ever going to have a faithful man??

It looked personal to me. It looked intimate, and very provocative. The image is seared into my brain and won’t go away.

These thoughts and feelings of betrayal and pain flood.

Another thought. What if he fantasized that he was with her and she had sent this to him?

Speaking of. I have to live with the fact that he was fantasizing what he wanted to do to her. He imagined having sex with her. He imagined having his hands all over her body. Touching her. Thinking of the places he wanted to do things to. Kissing her. Being inside her. Among other things unfortunately, maybe imaging how she feels inside, or the sounds she probably makes when she’s moaning or screaming. Maybe they were more intimate thoughts? More like, caressing her, telling her sweet things, making love to her, having her in his life.

She looked nothing like me. She was so sexy, beautiful and perfect in her lingerie. I was immediately jealous that she caught the attention of “my man” out of a crowd of pictures and posts, and I was jealous that I didn’t look like her. Even jealous that I didn’t look like her to get that sort of attention from him.

He doesn’t want me. He settled, and she is what he really wants, or at least someone that looks like her. 

I thought of her as his perfect ideal lover and how he wants her to look.

I think, if I was his ideal lover, he would have been looking at my picture and screenshotting it to his phone. 

I think, if he really loved me and if I was really “the one”, he would have scrolled past her.

He would have seen it, but averted his thoughts to me. 

I need to know if my thoughts are accurate.

I need to know if I’m “the one” or not. 



TL;DR: My experience and thoughts of what happened. I share my thought process and hopes to receive some answers or support.

\---  
The hospital gown fluttered in the breeze from the broken windows, its thin fabric doing absolutely nothing to protect against the chill. As Jin-woo took his first tentative steps, he couldn't shake the feeling that his body wasn't quite... his. The proportions felt wrong, the movements unfamiliar, as if someone had redesigned his physical interface without consulting the original specifications.

Each step became a little steadier, though his muscles continued to protest this sudden return to activity. Whatever had happened during the neural fusion attempt, it had clearly taken a significant toll on his physical form. The question was, how long had he been out, and what exactly had occurred while his consciousness was otherwise occupied?

The broken windows offered glimpses of a world beyond the room, but from his current angle, all he could see was a gray sky that provided no clues about his location or the time that had passed. The gentle breeze carried the scent of decay and abandonment, along with something else he couldn't quite identify, something that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up.

*At least no one can say my life is boring. Terrifying, confusing, and possibly trending toward disaster, but definitely not boring. Take that Kali!*

Jin-woo's legs finally steadied enough for him to shuffle across the debris-strewn floor, his bare feet carefully avoiding the scattered glass. That's when he caught his first glimpse of himself in a partially broken mirror mounted on the far wall. His already questionable grip on reality decided to take an extended coffee break. Muted shock that felt distant hit him like a truck.

*That's... not me. That can't be me.*

But the stranger in the mirror moved when he moved, stumbled when he stumbled, and wore the same expression of absolute bewilderment that he felt on his face. Except it wasn't his face. Not even close. He had a chubby face with a little stubble he kept delaying to shave. Not this intense sharp facial structure and small beard, no mustache. His eyes burned with an otherworldly light, teeth too perfect.

*Well at least this explains why walking feels like trying to pilot a mech suit with faulty controls*. He thought with the kind of hysteria that comes from discovering you've apparently been body-swapped with a professional athlete. And not just a run of the mill athlete either.

The reflection showed someone who could have walked straight off an Olympic swimming team's roster, or would have, if said team recruited members pushing close to seven feet tall and currently sporting the ""recently awakened from mysterious coma"" look. Even with clearly atrophied muscles, the frame was impressive. Long, lean limbs that suggested speed and power, broad shoulders, and a build that spoke of carefully cultivated strength rather than bulk. Wild black hair that felt too smooth when he ran his fingers threw them, the beard equally as soft to the touch.

""This is..."" he started to say, then stopped, startled by the unfamiliar resonance of his own voice. Only now had he noticed the foreign sound that came out of his vocal chords. Deeper and resonating, as though his words came out of his chest. ""Right. New vocal cords too. Fantastic. Any other surprises you'd like to throw at me, universe?""

The universe, as it turned out, was more than happy to oblige. It had a tendency of answering any challenges he threw at it by throwing the entire house brick by brick at him, enjoying an immense amount of sadistic glee at his suffering. It had too.

His new height gave him a different perspective on the room, one that had initially seemed fairly standard-sized but now revealed itself to be proportioned for someone of his current stature. The ceiling hung higher than hospital regulation would typically demand, the doorframe stretched taller than normal, and even the bed he'd been strapped to was clearly designed for someone well above average human dimensions.

*Either I'm in some sort of simulation*, he reasoned, trying to apply logic to an increasingly illogical situation, *or the neural fusion chamber did something significantly more dramatic than just interfacing with the AI.*

A movement from the broken window caught Jin-woo's attention, drawing him away from his reflection's existential crisis. The curtains swayed back and forth to a slightly warm breeze that felt good on his exposed skin. Each step toward the jagged opening felt more natural than the last, as if his new body was slowly remembering how to function. Or perhaps he was just adapting to piloting this improbable vessel.

“Alright,” he grabbed the edges of the window, glass crunching under his palms. “Let's see exactly what kind of reality I've managed to land myself in…”

The thought died halfway through as his eyes registered what lay beyond the window. His scientific mind immediately began cataloging details, even as the rest of his consciousness screamed in disbelief. This shouldn’t have been possible and yet here he was staring out into absurdity.

Far below, much further than he'd initially realized, a forest stretched toward the horizon. But calling it merely a forest felt like calling his AI project a simple computer program. The trees towered like organic skyscrapers, their canopies creating layers of vegetation that glowed with subtle bioluminescence. Vines that seemed to pulse with their own inner light wound their way up the building's exterior, their flowers emitting a sweet, almost hypnotic fragrance that reminded him of midnight jasmine mixed with something entirely alien.

*Fifteen floors up.* His analytical side noted. *The trees reach nearly eleven floors up average, with a few clearly much taller.*

Then he looked up at the night sky, and whatever remained of his assumption about being anywhere near Earth shattered like the window he was leaning against.

Three moons hung in the star-scattered expanse, a trio of celestial bodies that had no business existing in any reality he knew. The largest glowed with a pale green luminescence that cast otherworldly shadows across the landscape. Its companions, one pristine white, the other a subtle blue, created an interplay of light that made the bioluminescent flora below seem to dance in response. It was beautiful, beyond anything he could have imagined. But, as he knew quite well, bright and beautiful tended to mean deadly in nature. He refused to think this was any different.

""Okay,"" he said aloud. His new voice still startled him with its unfamiliar timbre. ""Either this is the most elaborate simulation ever created, or..."" He couldn't quite bring himself to finish the thought.

Strange silhouettes drifted through the distant sky, their forms suggesting creatures that evolved under completely different physical laws. The constellations above bore no resemblance to any star pattern he'd ever studied, and even the way moonlight reflected off surfaces seemed to follow rules he couldn't quite grasp. There were so many things foreign that his mind tried to categorize and file away. It made the world spin around him, only his strong grip on the remains of the window kept him from falling back onto the mess of glass and debris.

*Deep breaths,* he calmed himself, though his new lungs seemed determined to hyperventilate.

*Think this through logically. You interfaced with an AI that was rewriting its own code on a fundamental level. Clearly, something went sideways during that process. The question is... where exactly did I end up?*

The sweet scent from the alien flora wafted stronger, almost as if responding to his thoughts. In the distance, something that might have been a bird, if birds had multiple sets of wings and moved like liquid mercury, swooped between the massive trees. It disappeared in the foliage for a second before shooting out of the trees like a rocket, something within its massive talons.

*Right. New body, new world, new rules. Just another day in the life of ambitious AI research. Really should have read the fine print on those warning labels more carefully.*

His internal voice had begun to take on the slightly hysterical edge of someone whose reality had been completely upended. And yet, his mind barely registered the existential threat at all.

He remained at the window, watching the interplay of triple moonlight on the impossible landscape below, as his mind tried to reconcile his last memories of the neural fusion chamber with this new reality. Whatever had happened during that interface, it had done far more than just connect his consciousness to his creation, it had somehow transported him into... something else entirely. Somewhere that was a sea of green that rolled out further than he could see, even with his vantage point.

The question was: had he crossed into another dimension, jumped forward in time to some drastically evolved Earth, or landed in something even stranger? And more importantly, was he alone here, or had others made the same journey?

A gust of wind carried the alien forest's sweet scent stronger into the room once more. Jin-woo couldn't shake the feeling that something out there was aware of his presence. Whether that something was his evolved AI, this strange world itself, or something else entirely remained to be seen. He just hoped it wasn’t some massive monster that wanted to eat his guts while he screamed in horror.

*Well*. *I wanted to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. I just didn't expect those boundaries to push back quite so... literally.*

Jin-woo blinked as something flickered at the edge of his vision, a thread of light so thin he thought it didn’t exist, that vanished every time he tried to focus on it directly. The effect reminded him of trying to debug particularly elusive code, the kind that only manifested when you weren't looking for it. It took him a few attempts to even believe it was here and not a trick of the light instead.

*Either I'm having a stroke, or this bizarre situation is about to get even more interesting.*

After several frustrating attempts to pinpoint the source of the phenomenon, he remembered an old debugging technique, sometimes you had to look slightly away from the problem to see its true nature. He relaxed his focus, allowing his peripheral vision to guide him.

A translucent panel shimmered into existence before him, its edges wavering like heat distortion on a summer day. The display flickered uncertainly, as if it wasn't quite sure it should exist in this reality. It irked his mind more than he could have believed. Jin-woo shook his head and chose to ignore what he counted as an urgent plea to fix a system screen.

1i92fv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PornAddiction/comments/1i92fv9/feeling_lost_and_broken_betrayal_trauma/,Feeling lost and broken. Betrayal Trauma,"I woke up this morning still feeling like dog shit.

It's been weeks since I saw it.

I was crying on the way back home.

I was crying just now. Before even touching my coffee.

Thinking about that girl, that photo, seeing it on his phone.

An erotic and provocative picture of another women saved on his phone. 

Thinking about the moment he first saw her post, clicked on it, the thoughts and feelings he was having, and the thoughts that led to his decision to take a screenshot of it. 

We were together when he did that. And if we happened to be fighting or on the outs, we knew how much we loved each other and supposedly respected each other. We were supposedly in love with each other. How could he do that if he really loved me? How could he do that if he respected me?

This picture looked as if she had taken it herself and sent it to him.

That was my first thought when he swiped to it in his phone gallery for both of us to see and take in.

No...

My first thought was he’s cheating on me, because I didn’t know yet that it was a screenshot of an instagram post.

I thought it was a photo a woman had sent to him via messaging.

How long has he been cheating on me?

How long has he been talking to her?

Did she send this to him today?
It was among recent photos, so I knew it was during our relationship.

How does he know this woman?! I’m going to explode, fall apart, or wither into nothing.

Am I ever going to have a faithful man??

It looked personal to me. It looked intimate, and very provocative. The image is seared into my brain and won’t go away.

These thoughts and feelings of betrayal and pain flood.

Another thought. What if he fantasized that he was with her and she had sent this to him?

Speaking of. I have to live with the fact that he was fantasizing what he wanted to do to her. He imagined having sex with her. He imagined having his hands all over her body. Touching her. Thinking of the places he wanted to do things to. Kissing her. Being inside her. Among other things unfortunately, maybe imaging how she feels inside, or the sounds she probably makes when she’s moaning or screaming. Maybe they were more intimate thoughts? More like, caressing her, telling her sweet things, making love to her, having her in his life.

She looked nothing like me. She was so sexy, beautiful and perfect in her lingerie. I was immediately jealous that she caught the attention of “my man” out of a crowd of pictures and posts, and I was jealous that I didn’t look like her. Even jealous that I didn’t look like her to get that sort of attention from him.

He doesn’t want me. He settled, and she is what he really wants, or at least someone that looks like her. 

I thought of her as his perfect ideal lover and how he wants her to look.

I think, if I was his ideal lover, he would have been looking at my picture and screenshotting it to his phone. 

I think, if he really loved me and if I was really “the one”, he would have scrolled past her.

He would have seen it, but averted his thoughts to me. 

I need to know if my thoughts are accurate.

I need to know if I’m “the one” or not. 

(I experienced ALL of this. I felt the pain and flood of emotions. I felt every thought and every word you just read. It was real for me. No matter what he says, the explanations of his experience. My heart still broke. My image and beliefs I had for him that I loved and provided me with security and safety were shattered to pieces, and left me feeling lost and broken.)

*** It's important to know that the pain, feelings, thoughts repeatedly come back whether or not I am going about my day, or taking time to process this and grieve. What you're reading up above, was not the only time I experienced that in my head since it happened, and it's not always within my control to stop it or prevent it from happening. It's a daily battle that I have to live with for now. 

To him:  I would love to just erase my experience and take in yours so that it wouldn't be as painful. I would love to just chalk it up to ""remnants of p*** brain cuz you were single for so long"". But I had to find out the way that I did, you didn't even take care of me even in that moment. And NOTHING can change that. And nothing can change how wrong it was to give another woman that attention AND save her on your phone when you were telling me that you love me and you only have eyes for me. Now I have to experience betrayal trauma all over again. I have to grieve and process, and there's no way out of it but through it. I have to live with this pain, those thoughts and doubts, that image in my head, and the emotions. The emotions! I am a sensitive and emotional person, on top of being an overthinker. Do you have any idea the rollercoaster you put me on??? And I'm just supposed to believe and trust that eventually I'm going to feel restored and healed, ready to have that type of trust with someone again?

TL;DR: My experience and thoughts of what happened. I share my thought process and hope to receive some answers or support.

1i92edw,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1i92edw/3_yoe_unemployed_software_engineer_ireland/,"[3 YoE, Unemployed, Software Engineer, Ireland]","Hello,

I'm a 26-year-old Italian guy with 3 years of experience in web development.

I'm currently unemployed because I recently quit my job at a Big 4 company to move to Dublin. I know I could have kept my job until I found something else, but from what I’ve read, It’s quite difficult that someone calls me from Dublin while I’m still in Italy. I’ve already applied to a few positions without any luck. So, I decided to take a leap of faith, life is short, and I want to bet on myself. 😄

I plan to start my job search in Ireland in February and am currently reviewing my resume.

I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice or tips on improving my resume. I also have a few specific questions:

1. University: I haven’t finished university yet (I started working at the end of my first year), but I plan to complete my degree in the future.
   1. s it a good idea to include this on my resume and specify that my degree is still in progress?
   2. Would it be useful to list some relevant courses I completed and include their grades to show that I studied computer engineering with (I think) decent results?
2. Gap between high school and university: I started university three years after finishing high school because I spent that time studying piano. During those years, I also worked at a small web agency (I was the only employee) and did some sales work. How can I present this experience on my resume to show I wasn’t just sitting idle, without being too verbose?
3. Career transition: I’m okay with continuing as a web developer for now, but my long-term goal is to transition into software development. I know this means starting from scratch in many ways. How can I clearly communicate this to recruiters without sounding uncommitted to web development?
4. I worked primarily with SFCC (Salesforce Commerce Cloud), a platform mainly used by consultancy firms in Italy and Greece. In your opinion, could this be seen as a drawback? Should I present this differently—for example, by highlighting that I worked on a Node.js-like backend (since the SFCC language, RhinoJS, is essentially a Java implementation of Node.js)?

Note: I know that more than one page is too long, but this is just temporary, and I'll fix the pagination later.

Thank you in advance to everyone who takes the time to help me out. I truly appreciate your advice and support!

For years starting in my early 20s I got CHs regularly every year. The episodes would last about a month and a half to two months with daily headaches before going into remission until the next year. Sometimes I could end a headache early if I took sumatriptan when I first felt an aura of the headache. But most the time it ended in a crippling headache that would find me wandering the neighborhood in the middle of the night trying to get air and get my mind off it as much as possible. Other drastic measures were considered but luckily never acted upon. I am now 45 and have been in remission for 7 years and here's what I attribute it to. 1) I stopped drinking diet soda. I was drinking lots of Coke zero throughout my life, and switched to coffee for my caffeine intake. 2) Big focus on gut health. I noticed when I was having episodes if I ate lots of probiotics like yogurt my episodes would end sooner, so I've made gut health an important part of treatment. In fact, the one time in the last 7 years I started having what I call ""the twinges"" of CHs the early signs of going into an episode was after I had been on antibiotics which I'm assuming hurt my gut health. So I really focused on that and was able to avert them. Anyway, as always everyone is different but this is what worked for me. My heart goes out to everyone dealing with this demon.

Before I go any further in this story I just wanna a
apologize for doing a repost as I am new to reddit and I heard great things about the app and want to give it a try. I hope I don’t make grammatical errors in this post. If I did, I am sorry!


For Context, my Mum’s side of the family is poor, they live in a province in the Philippines. My Grandparents always finish their bank accounts and can’t save like their life depends on it. Thus why they told my Mum and her Brother to study hard and earn a good job with a high salary so that they can get somewhere in life. While my Mum studied hard my Uncle was partying and having girlfriends and one day he got someone pregnant who came from a well off family and they were forced to marry.

Also at that time my Grandparents were losing their house because they failed to pay it on time because they retired early. During this time my Mum finished college and became an accountant and bought the house and paid for my Grandparents basic maintenance and necessities at their new house due to parental expectations to take care of the family (this will be important later.) My Uncle was encouraged to study but my Grandfather's influence made my Uncle a taxi driver (bad idea).
He was dependent on my Grandparents and my Mum, and at some point my Uncle was coddled by my Grandparents ( the type where they believed their son did nothing wrong and can’t say no to the son afraid that he would be hurt.) So to help the family my Mum went to Dubai where eventually she met my Dad who is the same age as my Mum’s Brother and soon enough they got married and had me. Since my Uncle had nowhere to go he lived in my Mum’s house which she bought and slowly paid her loan which her Brother did not contribute a single penny despite my Mum not living there and still helping her Brother while also having her own family.

At this point in time my Aunt has 2 kids and one on the way (who by the way is the same age as me.) To help her Brother my Mum tried to help him get a job but in less than a week he left due to homesickness (I understand it’s normal to get homesickness but at the end of the day it is for the family you have created.)
Eventually My Aunt has 4 children, 3 female and 1 male, for some reason after everything they always ask my Mum for money whether that would be big or bigger even though my Aunt can borrow money from her siblings who are filthy rich than my Mum and they  would probably think it’s pennies to them. My narcissistic “Aunt” wanted her kids not to know that the house was paid by Mum and have been funding everything to keep alive and to top it all off with my Grandparents big ego they made the kids think it was a gift to them even though my Mum bought the house and it wasn’t in their name and her Brother knew that his Parents would not say no to him cause they are scared and when my Mum confronted her Grandparents they said it was an “inheritance”. At this time My Mum and I had to move to Australia for my education, because in Dubai to go to University is more expensive than going to high school. People who immigrated to a country know that it is a struggle, but my Aunt and Uncle believed that my Mum was making lots of money including my Grandparents but that has now changed and to this day they still think that. 
I remember my Mum’s constant stress and breakdowns and the late night phone calls 
at night and it wasn’t hard to figure out what it was about, but I am glad that my Dad had money to support me and my Mum, so she wouldn’t have to worry about me.

Whenever I go to the Philippines, my cousins are cold and distant towards me only saying basic things like ’hi’ and ‘hello’ like acquaintances while my extended family actually treats me like family. And whenever we come they know that we would be giving expensive things like coffee or nutella because it was expensive and we always give it to my Grandparents because they like it but they always take it from them and my Grandparents have no choice but to say yes, on certain occasions they will be like asking my Uncle to ask my Mum to buy certain things like food claiming it was for me but they always say ‘Sorry I forgot to give you a piece, maybe next time.’ (yk literal pigs)


Now to the current situation 
Last month we went back to my Mum’s place and man it was crazy, so basically my Mum has this land and their is a small storage space, and down the hill is my Uncle’s piggery business (which my Mum paid for but my Uncle works their while my Mum gets nothing) but in reality it is a house in the middle of her land. She wanted that storage space to be demolished if one day if she were to retire or sell she can remove it. From what I know if it’s there it would decrease in value. My Uncle lives there including his kids (30f), (25f), (16f) and (14m) and a grandchild from the (30f) who is (3f). The problem was that her Grandparents and her Brother did not tell her. And at the end my Dad talked with my Mum about negotiations and explained to my Grandparents about it in which they believed that my Uncle should get everything (stupid) that my Mum has left in which my Dad criticised my Grandparents for not helping my Mum and coddling over a grown man and also my Dad said to my Grandparents that if you like your son so much you should sell and what you have and live off of that (which my Grandparents refused because they don’t know how to save money.)

At the end the agreed with the negotiations that he gets to keep the business and the small house in the condition that they don’t do work on it and will instead get land and also my Grandparents have to give 2 pieces of land to my Mum’s name as she been helping my Grandparents for years and recently. has been paying for my Grandfather's injections which are really pricy. 
The thing was it was going well and my Uncle agreed to those terms but when he told my Aunt she considered it as a threat and told the kids about how my Mum is selfish and greedy and they are going to take their house, the storage house, the business and stop taking care of my Grandparents (which was absurd as they already got my Mum’s house already in their name and even though she doesn’t like her parents choices she still loves them) but either way her Brother followed in her words.

When they heard the news they believed a lie that 
my “Aunt” has said but my oldest cousin was hit the hardest. She is like my Uncle but except that she studied and could have had the same potential as my Mum but ended up getting pregnant early and now is married and has a child (3f). The problem with her is that she did not leave her parents house because she refused to live with her husband’s Mom (if you're curious about his occupation he is a seaman so he is never around). After she started posting things like “Nothing compares to the joy of a family that gathers, where the only goal is to lift each other up and see everyone succeed. No room for envy, only support.” Which was supposed to tell my Mum that she wasn’t helping the family even though they don’t know the truth, now their family hates us and My Aunt, Uncle and Older cousin are bashing my family and saying bad things about us and is wanting the worst things to happen to my Mum to the point where that she refused to look at her social media account. Now my Parents agreed that they won’t get anything from them, including land. The worst part was that my Grandparents saw the whole thing and did not confess what had happened all these years to them. 

Right now my Mum hasn’t commented or made a post about it and chose to stay quiet. However my Mum‘s perspective has changed about my Older cousin that she once knew, the same person who my Mum has seen growing up and took care of her when she needed treatment that her OWN parents can’t even afford. This new Older cousin is now living as an adult in a teenager body who tries to badmouth, yell and create a scene and is not acting like a Mother to her obese child who needs proper exercise not being overfed by eating junk food (yes she is a donut mom.)

I want my Mum to be ok, I want to cut them off but at the same time my Mum believes that it could divide the extended family and possibly destroy the whole family. I want to tell my cousins the truth but their Mom would brainwash them in which my Parents have calculated that it is only up to my Grandparents to tell the truth but they are so prideful and ashamed at the same time that they couldn’t afford the house that they once had lived in.

So I am asking on reddit to give me advice on how to deal with the situation. My Mum is not a confrontational type of person but I would like some advice on which I can share to her so that she could consider.
I will try my best to give and update and answer questions.

# That’s when I found what I now call my secret weapon

At first, I was skeptical. I’d tried countless **supplements** promising to fix my low energy, sharpen my focus, or magically help me drop those stubborn pounds. Nothing ever lived up to the hype. But something about this product caught my attention. Maybe it was the science-backed ingredients. Maybe it was the glowing testimonials that felt like they were written by people who’d been exactly where I was. Or maybe it was just desperation. Either way, I decided to give it a shot.

# Fast forward three months, and my life has completely transformed

The first thing I noticed was the **energy**. Not the jittery, crash-prone energy you get from caffeine or sugary drinks. This was clean, sustained energy that powered me through the day like a finely tuned engine. I woke up feeling refreshed—something I hadn’t experienced in years—and stayed focused and productive from morning until night.

And the mental clarity? Let me tell you, it was like wiping a foggy window clean for the first time. I could think faster, remember details, and tackle complex problems without the overwhelming sense of mental fatigue that used to haunt me. For someone who lives and dies by their ability to perform, this was a game-changer.

# Then came the physical changes

I’d always struggled with weight, especially around my midsection. No matter how much I worked out or tried to eat clean, progress was always slow. But with this product, my metabolism felt like it shifted into high gear. Combined with my renewed energy, hitting the gym didn’t feel like a chore anymore. It felt like an opportunity to push myself further. Within weeks, I started noticing changes in my body. My clothes fit better, the scale started moving in the right direction, and my confidence skyrocketed.

But the best part wasn’t just what I saw in the mirror—it was how I felt inside. There’s a unique kind of happiness that comes from knowing you’re living up to your potential, and for the first time in years, I felt like I was finally back in control.

I know it sounds dramatic, but I can honestly say this product changed my life. It wasn’t some overnight miracle, but it was the missing piece of the puzzle I’d been searching for all along. The natural ingredients, carefully chosen for their ability to support cellular energy, metabolism, and overall health, delivered exactly what they promised—and more.

Now, I’m not one to shout about products from the rooftops. But when something genuinely works, it’s hard not to share it. I went from being skeptical to becoming a believer, not because of flashy marketing or exaggerated claims, but because of results I could see and feel every single day.

I guess I was just like “hm, that’s not a normal feeling.” So, I started drinking green tea and a chamomile tea at night and I feel so much more relaxed!

I also got Irish Breakfast and it is pretty good in the morning sometimes. What other teas are good for overall wellness? I’d love some more to drink during the day and before bed. ",4,1737743244.0,tea,0,1.0,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

We would talk and get coffee/lunch together. Just friendly coworker stuff but I definitely did think he was cute. I never said anything because we worked together. I’ve actually had coworkers who did express interest in me and it made me super uncomfortable so I don’t want to do the same to him. There were times when I suspected he might’ve been interested but never knew for sure. He does know about the other coworkers who expressed interest in me and knew how uncomfortable I felt about it. I would catch A staring or checking up on me. I once was talking to a coworker about my dog but called my dog “my guy” jokingly and A was nearby and quickly interjected and asked about said guy and told him it was just my dog. I once had to sell concert tickets and asked A if he wanted them and asked if I meant we’d go together but I said I can’t go and needed to get rid of both tickets. I once asked him if he goes to the gym since I was talking to him about the gym and he went “are you asking to work out together?”.

We were sitting and I extended my arm to stretch out and he did too and almost touched hands LOL. Sometimes when I talk to him, I notice him adjusting his hair or licking his lips. I once briefly mentioned moving to be closer to work (and hence be closer to where he lives) and was asking about my plans for moving and what the timeframe looks like for that.

1i927j7,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1i927j7/age_of_demina_system_crash_and_reboot_chapter_22/,[Age of Demina! - System Crash and Reboot!] Chapter 2.2 | Where Am I?,"The hospital gown fluttered in the breeze from the broken windows, its thin fabric doing absolutely nothing to protect against the chill. As Jin-woo took his first tentative steps, he couldn't shake the feeling that his body wasn't quite... his. The proportions felt wrong, the movements unfamiliar, as if someone had redesigned his physical interface without consulting the original specifications.

Each step became a little steadier, though his muscles continued to protest this sudden return to activity. Whatever had happened during the neural fusion attempt, it had clearly taken a significant toll on his physical form. The question was, how long had he been out, and what exactly had occurred while his consciousness was otherwise occupied?

The broken windows offered glimpses of a world beyond the room, but from his current angle, all he could see was a gray sky that provided no clues about his location or the time that had passed. The gentle breeze carried the scent of decay and abandonment, along with something else he couldn't quite identify, something that made the hair on the back of his neck stand up.

*At least no one can say my life is boring. Terrifying, confusing, and possibly trending toward disaster, but definitely not boring. Take that Kali!*

Jin-woo's legs finally steadied enough for him to shuffle across the debris-strewn floor, his bare feet carefully avoiding the scattered glass. That's when he caught his first glimpse of himself in a partially broken mirror mounted on the far wall. His already questionable grip on reality decided to take an extended coffee break. Muted shock that felt distant hit him like a truck.

*That's... not me. That can't be me.*

But the stranger in the mirror moved when he moved, stumbled when he stumbled, and wore the same expression of absolute bewilderment that he felt on his face. Except it wasn't his face. Not even close. He had a chubby face with a little stubble he kept delaying to shave. Not this intense sharp facial structure and small beard, no mustache. His eyes burned with an otherworldly light, teeth too perfect.

*Well at least this explains why walking feels like trying to pilot a mech suit with faulty controls*. He thought with the kind of hysteria that comes from discovering you've apparently been body-swapped with a professional athlete. And not just a run of the mill athlete either.

The reflection showed someone who could have walked straight off an Olympic swimming team's roster, or would have, if said team recruited members pushing close to seven feet tall and currently sporting the ""recently awakened from mysterious coma"" look. Even with clearly atrophied muscles, the frame was impressive. Long, lean limbs that suggested speed and power, broad shoulders, and a build that spoke of carefully cultivated strength rather than bulk. Wild black hair that felt too smooth when he ran his fingers threw them, the beard equally as soft to the touch.

""This is..."" he started to say, then stopped, startled by the unfamiliar resonance of his own voice. Only now had he noticed the foreign sound that came out of his vocal chords. Deeper and resonating, as though his words came out of his chest. ""Right. New vocal cords too. Fantastic. Any other surprises you'd like to throw at me, universe?""

The universe, as it turned out, was more than happy to oblige. It had a tendency of answering any challenges he threw at it by throwing the entire house brick by brick at him, enjoying an immense amount of sadistic glee at his suffering. It had too.

His new height gave him a different perspective on the room, one that had initially seemed fairly standard-sized but now revealed itself to be proportioned for someone of his current stature. The ceiling hung higher than hospital regulation would typically demand, the doorframe stretched taller than normal, and even the bed he'd been strapped to was clearly designed for someone well above average human dimensions.

*Either I'm in some sort of simulation*, he reasoned, trying to apply logic to an increasingly illogical situation, *or the neural fusion chamber did something significantly more dramatic than just interfacing with the AI.*

A movement from the broken window caught Jin-woo's attention, drawing him away from his reflection's existential crisis. The curtains swayed back and forth to a slightly warm breeze that felt good on his exposed skin. Each step toward the jagged opening felt more natural than the last, as if his new body was slowly remembering how to function. Or perhaps he was just adapting to piloting this improbable vessel.

“Alright,” he grabbed the edges of the window, glass crunching under his palms. “Let's see exactly what kind of reality I've managed to land myself in…”

The thought died halfway through as his eyes registered what lay beyond the window. His scientific mind immediately began cataloging details, even as the rest of his consciousness screamed in disbelief. This shouldn’t have been possible and yet here he was staring out into absurdity.

Far below, much further than he'd initially realized, a forest stretched toward the horizon. But calling it merely a forest felt like calling his AI project a simple computer program. The trees towered like organic skyscrapers, their canopies creating layers of vegetation that glowed with subtle bioluminescence. Vines that seemed to pulse with their own inner light wound their way up the building's exterior, their flowers emitting a sweet, almost hypnotic fragrance that reminded him of midnight jasmine mixed with something entirely alien.

*Fifteen floors up.* His analytical side noted. *The trees reach nearly eleven floors up average, with a few clearly much taller.*

Then he looked up at the night sky, and whatever remained of his assumption about being anywhere near Earth shattered like the window he was leaning against.

Three moons hung in the star-scattered expanse, a trio of celestial bodies that had no business existing in any reality he knew. The largest glowed with a pale green luminescence that cast otherworldly shadows across the landscape. Its companions, one pristine white, the other a subtle blue, created an interplay of light that made the bioluminescent flora below seem to dance in response. It was beautiful, beyond anything he could have imagined. But, as he knew quite well, bright and beautiful tended to mean deadly in nature. He refused to think this was any different.

""Okay,"" he said aloud. His new voice still startled him with its unfamiliar timbre. ""Either this is the most elaborate simulation ever created, or..."" He couldn't quite bring himself to finish the thought.

Strange silhouettes drifted through the distant sky, their forms suggesting creatures that evolved under completely different physical laws. The constellations above bore no resemblance to any star pattern he'd ever studied, and even the way moonlight reflected off surfaces seemed to follow rules he couldn't quite grasp. There were so many things foreign that his mind tried to categorize and file away. It made the world spin around him, only his strong grip on the remains of the window kept him from falling back onto the mess of glass and debris.

*Deep breaths,* he calmed himself, though his new lungs seemed determined to hyperventilate.

*Think this through logically. You interfaced with an AI that was rewriting its own code on a fundamental level. Clearly, something went sideways during that process. The question is... where exactly did I end up?*

The sweet scent from the alien flora wafted stronger, almost as if responding to his thoughts. In the distance, something that might have been a bird, if birds had multiple sets of wings and moved like liquid mercury, swooped between the massive trees. It disappeared in the foliage for a second before shooting out of the trees like a rocket, something within its massive talons.

*Right. New body, new world, new rules. Just another day in the life of ambitious AI research. Really should have read the fine print on those warning labels more carefully.*

His internal voice had begun to take on the slightly hysterical edge of someone whose reality had been completely upended. And yet, his mind barely registered the existential threat at all.

He remained at the window, watching the interplay of triple moonlight on the impossible landscape below, as his mind tried to reconcile his last memories of the neural fusion chamber with this new reality. Whatever had happened during that interface, it had done far more than just connect his consciousness to his creation, it had somehow transported him into... something else entirely. Somewhere that was a sea of green that rolled out further than he could see, even with his vantage point.

The question was: had he crossed into another dimension, jumped forward in time to some drastically evolved Earth, or landed in something even stranger? And more importantly, was he alone here, or had others made the same journey?

A gust of wind carried the alien forest's sweet scent stronger into the room once more. Jin-woo couldn't shake the feeling that something out there was aware of his presence. Whether that something was his evolved AI, this strange world itself, or something else entirely remained to be seen. He just hoped it wasn’t some massive monster that wanted to eat his guts while he screamed in horror.

*Well*. *I wanted to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. I just didn't expect those boundaries to push back quite so... literally.*

Jin-woo blinked as something flickered at the edge of his vision, a thread of light so thin he thought it didn’t exist, that vanished every time he tried to focus on it directly. The effect reminded him of trying to debug particularly elusive code, the kind that only manifested when you weren't looking for it. It took him a few attempts to even believe it was here and not a trick of the light instead.

*Either I'm having a stroke, or this bizarre situation is about to get even more interesting.*

After several frustrating attempts to pinpoint the source of the phenomenon, he remembered an old debugging technique, sometimes you had to look slightly away from the problem to see its true nature. He relaxed his focus, allowing his peripheral vision to guide him.

A translucent panel shimmered into existence before him, its edges wavering like heat distortion on a summer day. The display flickered uncertainly, as if it wasn't quite sure it should exist in this reality. It irked his mind more than he could have believed. Jin-woo shook his head and chose to ignore what he counted as an urgent plea to fix a system screen.

You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

 I am a home espresso geek and therefore have become the adoptive parent of our Nespresso Momento in my office at work. This unit does not have the milk frother and I am confident that there is only coffee/ water going down. (I have a line of sight to the unit from my desk). I do a weekly clean consisting of taking off the pour nozzles for a wipe, removing drip tray from scrub and rinse, and scrubbing and rinse of the used pod container. I also put a kettle on to pour 1 L of boiling water down the drip tray.

 Despite this, there has been film accumulating in the drain hose. A few months back there was an issue with the unit draining because of the accumulation of crud in the machine. We had a technician come out and address it but it seems to be accumulating again. The descale has been done based on the machine prompts, our municipal water is very soft so I do not think it's calcium buildup.

 I am looking for input on how to prevent this from happening. Does anyone have ideas? I couldn't speak to the technician while they were here and it sounds like no maintenance was suggested. I thought the boiling water may help keep things moving along, but it doesn’t seem to work. Would a bit of Cafiza weekly down the drip tray help this from building up?

 Thank you for the help :)

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

I’m in university and i'm currently in my second semester. He is 23 and graduated in psych and i'm 22 studying Eng lit.  
Last semester my boyfriend and I were in bed and I injured my shoulder. I have the bad habit of cracking my bones too much, sometimes to the point of almost hurting them and being sore for a couple of hours.

It was Friday and at 4am he and I fell asleep on his couch, then at 7am he and I woke up and went downstairs to his bed, walking there I started cracking my knuckles and legs and hips and my shoulders and scapula. I heard a loud pop in my left shoulder and felt immediate pain. I remember thinking shit I shouldn’t have done that. We went to bed and I didn’t really think anything of it. At around 9am I was waking up slightly, he and I had been cuddling and I had my arms around him. I started moving my arms and immediately I screamed. My left shoulder was stuck in an unnatural position. It was incredibly painful. I don’t play sports and I’ve never really injured a bone or anything of the sort. I’ve never fractured my arms or ankle, and I was startled by the intense pain of your bone not being in the correct place. The pain was so great, I screamed and screamed and of course he woke up. He told me to please stop screaming that I will wake up the neighbours he asked what is going on and I said I don’t know my shoulder, I can’t move it hurts.

He told me to sit up and I said I couldn’t (I was lying on my side). My bone was dislocated and I would have spams of moments of the bone trying to get back into place. Those spams of moments were incredibly painful. My boyfriend tried to move me and I begged him not to touch me, it too painful. I plea him to call the ambulance, that I’m scared. He said no there’s no need he can deal with this that I should just listen to him.

I remember screaming at him that you aren’t a doctor please I’m scared call the ambulance. After an hour or so of him telling me to move and follow his instruction and me shouting at him that I can't move I feel like it will kill me he reluctantly called 911. He was visibly annoyed at me and I sobbed not only because of the pain but because of his attitude in that moment, I asked him to please stay in the room and he did and he scrolled on his phone, we were both quiet and I thought of nothing but my pain. When those moments of spams came I would scream, I couldn’t help it, it felt as if my bone was ready to crack itself just to return to its original position. My boyfriend told me numerous time to please stop screaming, I apologize and told him that I don’t want to scream I can’t help it.

The paramedics came eventually and they were kind, they tried to move me and I just couldn’t. I apologized to them over and over and told them I’ll be doing a lot of screaming. I cried when the women comforted me and said numerous time of course, that’s completely okay. They gave me the laughing gas dentist use to ease the pain, it didn’t do anything and bless them they gave me something stronger. I felt lighter, my pain eased a bit, I felt distanced from it. Then they moved me and I screamed and it was like my voice was coming from a whole other world.

I went to the hospital, the doctor said I tore two muscles in my shoulder and dislocate it. My boyfriend drove behind the ambulance, he kindly bought for me my favorite coffee.

Yesterday me and my boyfriend were fighting and he brought up that day. It wasn’t the first time he had brought up me completely disregarding his advice during that moment. Our fights yesterday was about a multitude of things, one of them was the fact that I shout when he and I fight and he doesn't like shouting. I've apologized multiple times for shouting during our arguments. He brought that friday and said, here is the full text. “What of when when I had to have fucking firefighters in my room to move you? Hell even on that day, despite me asking you to do basically everything the paramedics had you do except offering you painkillers and cutting your shirt (stuff like rolling over, attempting to sit up so I could drive you to the hospital) I was told by you that I'm ""not a doctor"". I don't owe you my fucking credentials but I am certified in cpr and first aid as well as having my lifeguard and swim instructor certifications (now expired) this means I've been trained on how to move people with injuries as serious as spinal ones. Even in that horrible moment of pain, who have you permission to lash out at me? Squeeze my hand, crush it, yell like you were doing and I'll deal with it. But you needed an enemy? Is that it? I shouldn't guess. Regardless, even in that scenario I got yelled at by you.” And I texted back “I'm sorry I yelled, I wasn’t thinking logically I was in pain”

Am I the asshole? He has brought up that day before and my shouting at him and everytime he does I apologize, I don't want to make excuses for myself but I was in severe pain that day. I can't help but feel so incredibly hurt that he doesn't even consider that.",1,1737742803.0,AITAH,10,0.67,False

I’m born and raised in America, to a non-culturally diverse family, so my perceptions are often very individualistic and based on a single set of norms. I try to hard to make up for that though with engagement in all things different than my family of origin. I’m here to learn and experience!!

I have a friend who is from Nigeria, we’ll be traveling together to their home country later this year. I feel that an invitation of that size indicates we are close. But, I’m finding that any time we have plans together they either don’t show up, don’t remember, or don’t have any concept of time. They’ve left me sitting at coffee shops, restaurants, and events for hours past the agreed on start time. They take calls and walk off with other people while we are spending time together. And, even agree to do events together and then won’t reach out to let me know they need to cancel when their plans change, leaving me to do the event alone without any forewarning.

I find myself hurt and a bit resentful. 
I’ve tried sending more reminders, outreaching when I’m on my way, and keeping activities to those they have specifically picked. They acknowledge their difficulties in maintaining time, but don’t seem to make any effort to make changes. I’m trying to understand if this difference in punctuality and honoring of activities is an indication of cultural differences or an indication that this person just isn’t a healthy fit for my life and I need to rethink our plans. 

Any help on understanding this, or in learning customs for my trip (if they don’t stand me up at the airport!), would be much appreciated!!

Wanting to see what the hype is about, I bought a few bags to try their beans. I picked up Milky Cake (of course), The Alchemist, and Dulcedo.  Since Dulcedo seems to be more in the medium roast realm from Dak's tasting notes, I figured that would be the best to start with while the other rest for another week or two.  (All roasted on Jan 10.)  Keep in mind my palate isn't exactly that of a somelier, but here are some notes on my first-ever experience with Dulcedo.

* Coffee: Dak Dulcedo
* Roaster's notes: A sweet, creamy and round Yellow Catuai from Fazenda do Saltowith. Tasting notes of orange liquor, sweet caramel and chocolate fudge.
* Grinder: Fellow Ode Gen 2 - set on 5.0
* Brewer: Ceramic Origami w/ Kalita 185 filters
* Water: Hendon water profile
* Temp: 87°C
* Brew Method: 50g bloom @ 30s, 50g low circular pours to 250g total
* Total Brew Time (TBT): 4:15

Notes:
Brew time was a bit long here, and I get a mild touch of bitterness. I'll coarsen the grind a couple clicks next time around to bring brew time closer to 3:30-ish.

Initial aroma and flavors reflect some red berries, reminiscent of dried cranberries, and maybe walnuts.  I suspect the walnuts are more because of the over-extraction in this cup.  Despite the bitterness, I got some decent sweetness in the cup, as well.  Body of the coffee is at least medium.  I'll have to pay more attention to it in the next cup.

As the cup cooled, I started noticing the cranberries sliding over into blood orange and caramel.  I could see how they picked out the ""orange liquor"" flavors.  I didn't notice the fudge mentioned on the box, though.

So far, a tasty first cup, but plenty of room for improvement on the next pour.  I really like the cranberry and blood orange.  I'll experiment a bit with grind size and some new water using the Scott Rao or Rao/Perger hybrid profiles, as well, now that I have what I need to make the necessary concentrated solutions.

Overall, a good first taste of DAK coffee.",1,1737742434.0,pourover,0,0.67,False

Since the very beggining I’ve had this feeling that she may be an avoidant and now I see her almost as a walking example of an avoidant, but I’d like to share my story and try to verify it. This place seems to be the right one (thank you, algorithm), so If you wanted to look at it, I’d be grateful.

We met on tinder. And I’m not gonna lie – she seemed so damn perfect I almost couldn’t have believed this. I have some experience with dating apps and, except her, there was no one that would make me so impressed. Everyone was at best quite okey, but she… she was everything I could ever dream of in life, especially on dating app. We had a match, so I wrote to her and… nothing. I haven’t even been left on read for like month or two so I accepted that she’s probably never going to see it and write back. But one day I saw notification and it turned out that she has replied to me. She was very impressed and visibly interested but at the same time she seemed to be very ashamed of the fact she writes back so late. She explained that she hasn’t been on tinder for quite a long time because of hard time at work, uni and so on. She even stated that she shouldn’t have written after so long and that she’s sorry.  I reassured her that this is fine, that I understand and that I’m glad she wrote to me. After few messeges she started to ask me very specific and direct questions – about my perception of intimacy, both emotional and physic, about my goals, about my boundaries in life and relationship and so on. She perceived it as weird but I perceived it as very mature and important and reacted positively on it. For few days we texted daily on tinder and everything was fine, completely adequate and normal. She even proposed to meet each other irl and we scheduled a meeting.  Suddenly she started to see my messages and write back with a huge delay and rather short, she herself explained that it is due to her working a lot which turned out to be true, cause she really worked not only 5 days a week but also took additional tasks for the 2 remaining days – she worked all the time, apparently. From the other hand, she used to brag about not having time for herself, house chores, friends and literally anything except from work and uni. I understood it somehow because I am master of laws myself so I do understand what does it mean to study something very time consuming. She also stated that she has very hard time in work due to incoming end of the year and that it shall last till the January. I told her that I do understand, that I appreciate that she communicates about it and that I’ll be patiently waiting till the January when things get easier for her. It is also important to state that at the time I lived in town about an hour from the city she was living in, but in January I was about to move there due to work (it had nothing to do with her, I would’ve moved there even if I didn’t meet her).

The time was passing, we met for the first time and month later for the second time. After the first meeting she told me that she is glad she finally met someone normal and that this meeting will definitely not be the last one. After this the texting was still quite occasional from her side but I knew about this hard time at work so I understood. After some time I proposed second meeting and she agreed. We met and this one resembled a date – we went to a restaurant and in the ending she asked whether I’d like to hug her what I obviously did. It was very important part because she was quite frequently saying that she doesn’t like physical intimacy of anyone but she would like to like it and that she doesn’t like it because no one made her used to it before. She was still a virgin and generally avoided physical contact even in non-sexual context. She also claimed that she has never been in a relationship and directly said that she “escaped”/”run from” every possible relationship so far but she hoped not to run from this one.  Which also seems important – at the very beginning of this second meeting she told me something like “listen… I do not use my phone 24/7, really. If I must I use it but I try not to if I doesn’t have to and I get easily tired of the screen”. Later she admitted that she wanted me to write less but then she told that the problem is not that I write frequently and a lot but that she has no time to read this all and text back when she works. I told her that this is okey and that I wouldn’t mind if she texted back after work or called back to discuss what I wrote to her. After this second meeting/date she reluctantly (as before) texted and replied but called me at new year’s eve with wishes. It was the moment we stopped using tinder and started using phones. We never had each other on socials because she wanted to take it slow and was very grateful that I did not insist on moving to socials fast, despite I totally wanted to cause tinder sucks as a communicator. Anyways from this moment we started to text via SMS and get rid of tinder, we totally started to operate via phones. She also asked frequently whether I date with other women (I was not), do my friends know about her, do my family knows about her and so on – all the answers was right and she seemed happy about this. She also stated that her mother is nice so I may have a nice mother-in-law. It is also quite interesting, because she was raised by a single mother and she claimed that she is not very close with her as a mother and that her grandma is more of a mother figure in her life. Anyways, sometime after second meeting I texted her that I found a flat to rent, that I am about to meet with owner and see it and that I may tell her later about how it went. She texted me that she would like to hear about it and then that she would like to highlight that she is interested and thinks about me even though she is so busy right now. I replied that I do know, that I do understand and that she doesn’t have to worry about it, because I know about her hard time at work and that I’m patiently waiting till January. She replied with happiness and relief.

Sometime after this  days I told her that I just rent this flat so soon I would move to the city she lives in. Immediatelly after this she called me (first time since new years eve, it was around January 3th), she congratulated me and she asked how I perceive future of this relationship. I told her that I am enthusiastic about it and that I look at it with hope, she told me that she either and started to sob that she’s completely aware that she may ruin everything due to her perpetual business and that she would like me to know that if it gets ruined this will be only her fault. I told her that everything is alright, that I do know that making a room in your life for a partner isn’t something you do in one day, that I hope it will start getting better when I move in already (she knew that I lived like 20 minutes on foot from her work and from her flat, so meeting would become extremely easy). She once again seemed relieved and told me that she knows it would sound funny cause she had claimed that she didn’t like physical contact but she would love to hug me now. During this call she asked me if we were going to meet in nearest future, but this topic somehow faded away. This was very nice call actually and I felt good with the fact she called, she wanted to meet, she stated that she would love to hug me and so on. The next day I realized that we didn’t schedule a meeting so I texted her and she told that she wanted to schedule one but the subject faded away because she decided it will be easier to schedule when I am already moved in the city. When I moved in I informed her about it and we talked via SMS a lot about some cutely stupid things like that I do like ketchup but hate tomatoes or that she is lactose intolerant, I asked her for opinion about my new backcloth I’m about to buy and so on. Suddenly, out of nowhere, especially in the context of this nice talk we’ve been having, she hit me with something like “\[my name\], I really do appreciate your effort and how much you engaged in this but I beg you to consider every possible course of things because so far I am not sure of anything and I am afraid I will hurt you.” after which she just casually returned to our sweet little smalltalk. I told her that I am completely aware of risks involving dating and that I am totally aware that everything may happen but that I would rather be myself, engage  the way I always do and if it won’t work out between us I would be aware that it failed when I was myself and that I didn’t act like someone I am not. I was expecting her to dump me after her message but she positively shocked me with something like “I am very grateful for this message. Goodnight :\*”. I was totally WTFed. I expected everything but this. She has never before texted me goodnight. She has never before sent me a heart emoji, a kiss emoji or something. And now she does both of this. In THIS exact moment. I was positively shocked.

After this everything was as before, no change in any direction, and few days after this I asked her about her free time in January so we could start seeing each other more regularly. She didn’t tell me anything long-term (like whole January or sth) but she told me that she caught a flu but if I’m not scared by it I could catch her the following day after her work and grab a fast coffee. I agreed and finally we met at her work. She had an idea of me walking her to her place but due to snow and her being ill I proposed to stay inside not to risk her health and that later I could accompany her in her ride home with a bus. She agreed, so we grabbed a coffee. We spent great time together, she grabbed my hand herself and told me things like “it is nice to see you even for 40 minutes” or “my friends asked about you and advised me not to run from this too soon”. Suddenly she asked me if I could be friends with someone I’ve dated. I told her that I could not, that I am too sensitive for this, that It would hurt me, that It would be weird for the next person I would date If I had my ex-date still around and that generally I do not do such things and would like not to. She told me that she know this was a stupid question and then it went very well. We talked about some important things like what we expect from the relationship, what makes us happy and unhappy in relationship and so on. I also told her that she shall know that I am afraid of being rejected and that this correlates with me having anxious attachment style. I would like to highlight here that I’ve been in therapy for almost 2 years, I am working very hard on myself and my therapist claims I do behave like someone with generally healthy attachment style right now. She (the girl I was dating) also stated that I am the only man around whom she feels safe and that I am the only man who’s touch she eagers despite generally not liking it. At the end she decided to return home by taxi, so I told her to let me know when she returns safely and we parted. I’d like to highlight that I always asked her for feedback that she returned home safe, that she always agreed to do so and that she never did. Anyway, I returned home and after some time I asked if she’s home safe. Around midnight she text me that she did return home safely and we started another sweet little smalltalk. Once again she interrupted this sweetness with something like “I would like to tell you sth but I know that you’ll get angry at me”. I asked her to say it and she said “I am afraid that if something doesn’t work out between us in the future I would lost a great friend too…  damn, I fucking hate my concerns…”. I asked her what she meant, is she going to friendzone me and is everything okay between us but she replied with something like “This is not something for texting and especially not in the middle of night. I really gotta go to sleep or I won’t weak up for work tomorrow”. I told her that I understand but I would like to talk about it tomorrow because it seems to be important and I wouldn’t like to left this unsettled. She didn’t text back, proly went to sleep and I totally lost my shit. I panicked. I freaked out. I called 2 my best friends and vented to them. I was totally confused what just happened, why she suggested friendzone when everything was so great today and recently and why did she left me alone with this for whole night after starting this herself.

In the morning she texted that she’s losing her voice due to illness. I replied something dry to this and after some time I sent her long but calm text in which I stated that I am totally confused, that I would like to talk about it and settle it, that I do understand her being at work and ill but also wouldn’t like to be left with this for couple of days and that I am not mad at her and that I believe that this is some misunderstanding we can settle and laugh from and that I do not accuse her of any malicious intents and so on and so on. She replied that she will text or call me after work and then proposed that I could approach her after her work instead. I did so and I was totally convinced that we are going to talk about this situation and rectify it. I was shocked that she started it with “Listen anon, you’re a great man and you will be a great father and husband…”. Long story short she stated that she want to withdraw from this relationship romantically but would like to stay friends, that she isn’t ready for a relationship and bunch of things that didn’t make any sense like “you need to finish your therapy first” (she wasn’t in therapy in the first place and my therapists said there is no problem with me being in relationship while still In therapy) and other things that I suppose was just projecting herself on me cause she was referring to things that I and my therapist would totally tell about her and not me. She stated that I write too much and too long texts, that we won't be able to find time for each other when I start my new job and so on - I told her that it is totally untrue, that we can make it work, that we can decide that she replies after work or something and that we could totally see each other even if we both work quite demanding jobs becuase I could catch her after her work for a fast coffee once a week and it would be okay and the real dates could initially occur only once a month and it would also be okey and noticed that she has never tried to make things work and now comes and says that it doesn't work without even trying to talk with me about it and make it work. I also directly told her that she may be avoidant and described the avoidant’s behavior pattern that I totally saw in her but she either denied or just stayed silent. She also insisted that she does it for my own good, that it will benefit me and bunch of other stuff like this that I totally did not buy. Finally she stated that I shall think about this and contact her if I would be interested in being just friends. I told her that I wouldn’t be able to be friends with her and that we either have romantically-based relationship (talking, dating etc.) or no relationship at all.

The next day I had a therapy and talked about it, I thought that I may understand what she meant so I asked her for a phone call and she agreed but it turned out that I was wrong and she meant what she meant. Tbh I didn’t even know that she ended this all the previous day and she notified me about this directly the day I called her. We talked for a while, I tried to show her my point of view and what I learnt during therapy, she totally denied it all and still tried to explain to me why she doing it for my benefit and so on. In the end she got almost mad and asked why I do not understand that she’s doing it for me blah blah blah, I told her that I do not understand it cause it doesn’t make any healthy sense. After this we calmly decided that we do not have anything more to say to each other so we wished each other the very best and ended the call. After few hours she phoned me again out of sudden, she had crying voice, I asked her about it but she claimed it was due to her illness, she told me that she wanted to thank me and that she wishes me the best and that she thinks that she made a right decision. I told her that if she thinks so and if she is at peace with herself thanks to it then I am glad she made this decision even if I do not agree with this and with the reality that this decision creates for me. Then we once again thanked ourselves for everything, said lots of goodbyes, byes and so on and finally hung up. Few days after this I texted her despite I’ve never ever done sth like this since I was like 17. I told her that I know this is stupid but I miss her and that everything reminds me of her, which was true. She texted back after few hours that she is thankful for a kind text and that I will manage to deal with it and that I shall give myself time. I didn’t texted back and tomorrow’s gonna be a week from this text and almost 2 weeks from the day she dumped me.

My algorithm on socials started to show me content about avoidant partners and everything fits her so well I am almost sure she was an avoidant, my therapist also thinks so but I wanted to share this story with you and maybe get some feedback from you either. I also wonder: shall I expect her to reach out for me again? Shall I reach out for her in 3 or 6 months? or shall I forget about her? I totally do not know what to do and do not understand what happened even though I generally understand majority of avoidants patterns and so on.",1,1737742379.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False
