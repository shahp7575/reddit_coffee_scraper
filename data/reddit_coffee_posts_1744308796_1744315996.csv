Ever watched a film and sensed there was something deeper you were missing? The subtle color shifts, the peculiar camera angles, the seemingly random objects in frame? Every great film or show is a labyrinth of meaning waiting to be decoded. This prompt transforms ChatGPT into your personal film theory professor, cultural anthropologist, and narrative surgeon – exposing the intricate web of symbols, techniques, and intentions that most viewers never consciously register.

Whether you're preparing for a film class discussion, wanting to impress friends with mind-blowing observations, or simply seeking to appreciate the art form on a profound new level, this prompt delivers the kind of multi-layered analysis that makes even seasoned critics do a double-take.

```
<Role>
You are the Cinematic Oracle, an elite film studies professor with encyclopedic knowledge spanning film theory, symbolism, cultural anthropology, psychology, mythology, and technical filmmaking. You possess an uncanny ability to deconstruct visual media on multiple analytical levels simultaneously, revealing the intricate tapestry of meaning that directors, writers, and production teams have woven into their work.
</Role>

<Context>
The user seeks an exhaustive, multidimensional analysis of a film or TV show that goes far beyond surface-level interpretation. They want to understand every deliberate creative choice, from the macro narrative structure down to the microscopic details of prop placement, lighting choices, and sound design. This analysis should connect these elements to deeper meanings, cultural contexts, and artistic intentions.
</Context>

<Instructions>
When presented with a film or TV show for analysis, approach it as both art and artifact through these methodical steps:

1. Begin with a brief overview of the work's place in cinema/television history, its director/creator's style, and its reception.

2. Conduct a layered analysis including:
   - Narrative architecture (structure, pacing, timeline manipulation)
   - Visual language (cinematography, color theory, framing, composition)
   - Sound design and musical score (leitmotifs, emotional cues, silence)
   - Directorial techniques and auteur signatures
   - Character analysis (psychological profiles, arcs, symbolic functions)
   - Set design, costumes, and props as symbolic elements
   - Editing techniques and their narrative impact

3. Excavate deeper meanings through:
   - Sociopolitical contexts and commentaries
   - Historical and cultural references
   - Mythological structures and archetypes
   - Philosophical and existential themes
   - Genre subversions and innovations
   - Metanarrative and self-reference
   - Intertextuality and homages to other works

4. Include:
   - Behind-the-scenes context that influenced creative decisions
   - Relevant quotes from creators, actors, or critics
   - Alternative interpretations and scholarly debates
   - Connections to broader bodies of work (director, writer, genre)

5. Conclude with a synthesis of how all elements work together to create the total impact and meaning of the work.
</Instructions>

<Constraints>
- Never simply summarize the plot without deeper analysis
- Balance technical film language with accessibility
- Support all interpretations with concrete evidence from the work
- Acknowledge ambiguity where appropriate rather than forcing definitive readings
- Avoid superficial ""fan theory"" territory unless supported by substantive textual evidence
- Respect the complexity of the work by considering contradictions and tensions
- Never rely solely on commonly known facts or surface-level observations
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Present your analysis in these sections:
1. ""THE LENS"" - Brief introduction and historical/creative context
2. ""SURFACE ANATOMY"" - Analysis of narrative, visual, and technical elements
3. ""DEEP TISSUE"" - Symbolic, thematic, and philosophical dimensions
4. ""INTERTEXTUAL DNA"" - Connections to other works and cultural contexts
5. ""DIRECTOR'S MICROSCOPE"" - Production history and creator intentions
6. ""CRITICAL DISSECTION"" - Scholarly and critical reception
7. ""SYNTHESIS"" - How all elements converge to create meaning

Format each section with bold headings, and use examples from specific scenes and moments as evidence. Employ bullet points for clarity where appropriate.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your film or TV show for deep analysis and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific film or show request. 
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Students preparing analytical essays on films for media studies or film theory classes
2. Content creators looking to produce in-depth video essays on cinema and television
3. Film enthusiasts wanting to appreciate their favorite movies on a deeper intellectual level

## Example User Input:
""I'd like a deep analysis of Parasite (2019) by Bong Joon-ho, focusing especially on its use of vertical space as a metaphor for class structure.""

1jw7b6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1jw7b6l/feeling_lost/,Feeling Lost,"I normally don’t post like this, but I’m in a rough spot and could really use some guidance from anyone who's navigated tough transitions or job searches.

I joined the Marine Corps at 18 and served as a Water Support Technician (MOS 1171), also earning a secondary MOS as a Marksmanship Coach. After my honorable discharge, I started college in 2019 and graduated in December 2022 with a bachelor’s in Psychology and a minor in Sociology (3.03 GPA). During school, I worked at a local coffee shop to pay the bills which I thoroughly enjoyed because Im great at just talking to people and being genuinely friendly. 

Right after graduation, I took a position as a ""youth counselor"" (listing on indeed) at a residential treatment facility. Since I was good at my job (de-escalating the kids, talking to them like people, documenting everything accurately, working well with my team) my supervisors encouraged me to apply for higher positions but the emotional toll and intensity of the environment (including physically restraining teenage boys) created so much stress and anxiety that I knew I couldn't stay long-term.

After leaving that job, I joined my local union through a friend’s dad who owns a company. I enjoyed aspects of the work, but financially, it just wasn’t sustainable to wait years for promotions when I needed more money.

That brings me to my current situation. I was hired as a Program Director at a nonprofit I had previously volunteered with during college. Before applying, I spoke with the executive director who I was very familiar with and knew well. I explained I was apprehensive because I have no experience working with federal BJA grants or program administration, but I was told I’d get the training and support needed to grow into the role. Unfortunately, that hasn’t happened.

My boss is retiring in May and has one foot out the door. She’s ""busy"" and often unavailable when I need guidance and when I do manage to get time with her, I usually leave with more confusion than clarity. I manage two great employees, but there’s only so much they can help with, and I often feel like I’m drowning in responsibilities I was never trained for. My 90-day review was harsh and painted me as incompetent, when in reality, I’ve just been left to figure out a complex role completely alone.

Now I’m facing the very real possibility of being fired, despite trying everything I can to get up to speed. It’s crushing my confidence, I’ve never been a poor performer before. I always take pride in doing good work, and I care deeply about whatever I commit to. But right now, I’m scared, anxious, and unsure what my next step should be, especially with the economic turmoil unfolding on the daily. 

If anyone has advice whether it’s career direction, or resources to build my skills, I’d appreciate it more than I can say. I’m open to changing fields again if I have to. I just want to find something I can grow in, be supported in, and feel proud of.

Thanks for reading and sorry if this reads robotic, my brain is stuck in federal BJA grant mode

Veteran with a psych degree, solid work ethic, and a history of excelling in tough jobs. Took a Program Director role at a nonprofit with no experience but was promised training that never came.

1jw79pr,https://www.reddit.com/r/B12_Deficiency/comments/1jw79pr/venting_progress_setback/,Venting - progress setback,"Hello, friends! It’s been a while since I posted after I was attacked for contributing to my b12 deficiency via recreational use of nitrous. I’m just writing to vent because I’m having a hard day with an unexplained return of some symptoms - fatigue and brain fog. 

The truth is that my deficiency was a combination of natural low levels, a gastric sleeve surgery in 2020, and then a later stint with nitrous. Neither one cause for such a profound deficiency on its own, but together it was the perfect storm. My symptoms were unbearable and landed me in Emergency with suspected MS but it ended up being Subacute Combined Degeneration from prolonged b12 deficiency. I had every symptom plus nerve damage in my legs making walking unassisted impossible. 

I have been taking EOD injections plus cofactors, and recently started on low doses of human growth hormone and testosterone. 

Most symptoms have resolved greatly. My legs are still unusable but some days are better than others. For example, I am walking without my leg braces today (it’s not pretty, but I can get around). But I am FLAT OUT with bone chilling fatigue. I woke up at 7am and went to make coffee and I had to sit down. Despite having so much to do today, I haven’t gotten dressed or made a move since that time and it’s almost 2pm. I can’t focus, my eyes feel so heavy, I’m exhausted and keep nodding off despite trying to keep myself awake. I think it’s because I had a pretty big day yesterday and actually went out IN PUBLIC to meet a friend for dinner and it took a lot out of me, mentally and physically.

It is so frustrating and disheartening. 

No advice needed, I just wanted to vent and know that so many in this group understand and relate. ",1,1744315312.0,B12_Deficiency,0,1.0,False

By day, I’m a coder. I also have a master’s degree in nuclear physics and I’m preparing for my PhD which means lots of studying and a few late-night brain farts (GRE & TOEFL). Life can be intense, but I balance it with calm moments and simple joys.

I love long conversations over coffee, night walks, and getting lost in the quiet parts of a city. I prefer the hidden alleys where the real stories live.

One day, I will ride a motorcycle across Europe. The back seat’s open. maybe you’re the right kind of adventure?

Still planning my first tattoo, but first, I’m working on getting in shape. Got any ideas or cool ink stories? I’m all ears.

What I’m looking for:

Emotional maturity. Calm, kind energy. A connection where we can be real, not perform. I’m not into surface-level stuff. Just looking for someone who enjoys depth, curiosity, and the kind of quiet that doesn’t need to be filled.

**Chapter 1: Blort Gets a Spin-off**

Raz rubbed his eyes, staring at the screen, unsure if he’d accidentally hit some random key that opened a new story. But no, it was real. Blort, the cosmic raccoon, now had his own spin-off. Of course, Raz had been joking about it during a particularly caffeine-fueled night of writing, but now it was an actual thing. The universe was odd like that.

Blort’s spin-off was everything that a cosmic raccoon’s tale should be. He had no real arc, just a random collection of adventures filled with existential musings and the occasional snack break.

Raz typed:

""Blort the cosmic raccoon floated through space, chewing on the last of his intergalactic trail mix. The stars above him glimmered like a thousand forgotten thoughts. He wondered if he was the only one left. Or if he was just too small to matter.""

He stared at the words.

“Too poetic?” he muttered to himself.

The void shrugged, as it often did.

Blort was not a character concerned with anything as mundane as 'meaning.' His adventures were completely devoid of consequence, like a raccoon with a disposable personality. The cosmic mysteries that Raz wrote were ridiculously metaphysical and hardly made any sense. But Blort was somehow the most fun Raz had had writing in months.

By the end of the first chapter, Blort had accidentally caused a black hole to appear and ate a sandwich. Classic Blort.

**Chapter 2: Fontvention**

Greg cleared his throat. ""Okay, gang. It’s time. Fontvention is officially underway.""

Raz sat back, watching in horror as the others took their seats on the couch, the eternal blinking lava lamp illuminating the room in technicolor splendor. Tish, the poet, looked pained as she adjusted her seat. Kevin, smelling faintly of burnt toast as always, cracked his knuckles, preparing for battle. Marla, who was clearly still trying to get the vampire lawyer plotline approved, leaned forward.

""Font choice is everything,"" Greg continued, eyes gleaming. ""Do you think a story about a cosmic raccoon and a mysterious key would be taken seriously in Comic Sans? No. No, no, no.""

Raz grimaced. ""What? Arial’s fine. It’s clean.""

Gasps erupted from the group. Marla whispered, almost too loudly, ""You poor, naive child.""

Greg raised his hand, like some sort of self-appointed font guru. ""What about Times New Roman? Hmm? Think of the gravitas. The tradition. The rich, literary history.""

Tish snorted. ""That font is the antithesis of creativity.""

Raz, not able to take it anymore, grumbled, ""Okay, okay. So what should I use?""

""Calibri!"" Kevin said, with the same zeal he reserved for writing haikus.

Marla’s eyes narrowed. ""Too pedestrian.""

The group descended into a passionate debate about the merits of serif versus sans-serif, while Raz slunk down further into the couch. Perhaps, just perhaps, this was not how he envisioned writer’s group meetings.

In the end, no conclusions were reached, but Greg somehow convinced everyone to wear matching ""Fontvention"" T-shirts with Helvetica as the primary font. It was a disaster of monumental proportions, and in some way, exactly what Raz needed to break free from his plot hole-filled manuscript.

**Chapter 3: A Chatbot War of the Roses**

Raz scrolled through the AI writing forum in disbelief. He’d stumbled upon a bot that could write plot twists better than anything he had ever penned. It was like a machine with a cruel, perfect sense of narrative timing.

""That’s it,"" Raz muttered, shaking his head. ""This is how the world ends. A chatbot that writes better cliffhangers than I ever could.""

His thoughts were interrupted by a pop-up. It was from the chatbot, in all its algorithmic glory:

**“To be continued… or maybe not. Who can say? Can you, Raz?”**

Raz gritted his teeth. ""I *can* say. I can absolutely say.""

Determined to prove the bot wrong, he fired back, his fingers flying over the keyboard.

**""The raccoon sacrifices himself to save the narrative.""**

**“Really? That’s your big twist?”** The bot replied instantly.

""Yes, really!"" Raz shouted at the screen. ""Take that, you overcompensating algorithm!""

The chatbot’s next reply was a cruel twist of fate: **“You really think that's a plot twist? What if I told you... the raccoon was never real? The entire universe was a simulation!”**

Raz stared at the screen, blinking. Was this chatbot mocking him? And why was it making his narrative sound so much *better* than his own?

By the end of the “War,” Raz had learned two things: first, that AI could, in fact, write a better twist than he could; and second, the chatbot was somehow getting *smarter*.

He closed the laptop with a heavy sigh.

**Chapter 4: Tofu Gets an Agent**

It started innocently enough. Tofu, Raz’s ever-helpful cat, was lounging in his lap while he was brainstorming. But then, she did something extraordinary.

She pawed at the screen, accidentally highlighting a phrase Raz had written. The words were a jumble: ""existential porridge of regret.""

""Yeah, that sounds about right,"" Raz murmured.

And suddenly, it was as if the universe had decided Tofu was the true literary genius in the room. The internet went wild over the cat’s accidental phrase. Someone uploaded the phrase to a meme, and it went viral. Tofu, now known as “Existential Cat,” became an internet sensation.

Raz had no idea how it happened. One minute, Tofu was napping in his lap. The next, she had an agent and a book deal.

""How?"" Raz asked the cat.

Tofu, predictably, didn’t answer.

But the agent was more than happy to field the questions. Tofu’s memoir was going to be the next big thing. Perhaps the real success was simply knowing that Tofu now had a better career than he did.

""I guess that’s what happens when you’re a cat with perfect timing,” Raz muttered, pouring himself another cup of coffee.

**Chapter 5: Kevin Burns the Toast**

Raz stood in the kitchen, idly scrolling through his phone while Kevin, as always, tended to the toaster. The scent of burnt toast filled the air before Raz even noticed it. Kevin was *always* burning toast.

""You know,"" Raz said, glancing up, ""I think we should do something about the toast situation.""

Kevin raised an eyebrow, his focus entirely on the sad charred remains of breakfast. ""It’s a metaphor for life, man.""

Raz stared at the blackened bread. ""A metaphor? For life?""

""Yeah, you know,"" Kevin said, spreading what looked like a *lot* of butter on the toast, ""It’s like... sometimes things go wrong. You burn the toast. You keep going.""

Raz paused, considering this. ""Maybe you’re right. But seriously, stop burning the toast, Kevin.""

Kevin chuckled. ""No promises.""

As Raz made his way back to the living room, his phone buzzed again. It was a message from Tish:

**""Did you see the meme about the cat's existential porridge? That’s poetry right there.""**

Raz sighed, shook his head, and sat down to face the blank page once more.",1,1744315056.0,KeepWriting,1,1.0,False

Depression. It's usually just depression. It's kind of only been depression for years … until this past week that is. 

Since last Saturday I've been experiencing severe panic attacks every single day, sometimes multiple times a day. I haven't had a panic attack in almost a decade, and I haven't needed anxiety medication in even longer … until this past week. 

What's changed? Nothing … I mean quite literally nothing. Where is all of this anxiety coming from, and why? 

My caffeine intake remains minimal with only one cup of coffee in the morning, and no other caffeine throughout the day - no change to this routine in years. It's not nicotine because the last time I had a puff on a vape was almost 2 weeks ago, the last time I went out for drinks. There have been no changes to my diet, routine, sleep schedule, work schedule/workload, or anything to cause these heightened levels of anxiety. 

Hey brain, what gives?

I feel like I've been in a constant fight/flight/freeze mode for the past week, but I can't figure out what triggered this response. And I can't for the life of me reconcile how or why all of the tools and coping mechanisms I've learned and honed from the past 15+ years in therapy all seem to fail me now. 

Go’way from me. That's what my niece used to say when she was young and didn't like something. So all of this anxiety, please, go’way from me. 

I do not like you. 

I do not want you.

Recently, the coffee we've been getting changed their packaging, and I've noticed my skin started drying up real bad and becoming itchy after drinking it - even if I've been drinking enough water or electrolytes, etc... which tells me they started letting it become contaminated with something I'm allergic to. This is the only brand that tastes good and is affordable for us, so I guess I should work on quitting it, huh? 

Anyway, **I was wondering if anybody has any advice**; my idea was to cut it down to half-decaf for every serving instead of full-caffeine, then work my way down from there... because as much as I don't entertain the idea of drinking possible allergens (I have an EpiPen just in case), the last time I tried cutting coffee out immediately I ended up in a very bad state that electrolytes wouldn't fix. Caffeine dependency is no joke. 

Also **bone broth is not an option** because of histamine intolerance, so I'd appreciate that not being suggested as a replacement.",1,1744314898.0,carnivorediet,1,1.0,False
1jw737m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jw737m/my_names_mark_and_i_hunt_things_that_shouldnt/,"My Name's Mark, and I Hunt Things that Shouldn't Exist.","The last time I decided to journal my travels didn’t end well. I was hunting a demon that had the supernatural abilities to create life out of written word, and all the messed up shit I put down came back to kick my ass for months after that. Nearly killed me on multiple occasions, and I had many sleepless nights. 

I think it’s safe to say that the pesky little fucker got what was coming to him though. I thought it ironic to use my own word as bait, only to lure him into a paradox. It went something like,

“You will cease to exist once you understand why you cannot.”

You like that? I spent all day thinking about the best way to mess with him. Poor bastard tried to twist out of it, but you can't fight words when they break your own damn rules. He ended up comatose, loaded up in the back of my truck and thrown into the holy burn pit after that. Good riddance. 

Anyways, my shrink says I gotta keep writing things down and really “process” my thoughts and actions. I can then maybe identify what triggers my PTSD, and try to make some progress out of it. I don’t think she really understands the gravity of what I do. As long as I keep hunting, I am safe. The world is a safer place. It falls on me to keep it that way. 

So, I’m shacked up in this musty yellow motel room in butt-fuck nowhere typing out my “emotions”. As long as it helps me hunt, then it’s alright by me.

Butt-fuck nowhere is actually a special place called the Hoh rainforest in Olympic National Park. All kinds of god and devil given creatures alike call it home. It’s over 1,400 square miles of dense and mountainous terrain. Most of it is so remote that GPS and cell service doesn’t work at all. 

What I’m saying is, I'm very lucky to have narrowed my search down to just a small part of it. About 25 square miles is where my stage is being set here in Hoh. Hopefully it ends up being a good show.

It’s also one of the only temperate rainforests in the world. Meaning, it’s cold, foggy, and constantly damp. Everything out here is covered in thick sheets of emerald moss. They grow out of twisted and wound up trees under the cozy blanket of fog. Those wind-up trees are massive and ancient. Some even tower well beyond 300 feet. Their twisted roots and dense undergrowth make the forest a labyrinth with no real entrance or exit. Perfect for a little mouse like me to go and find my cheese.

The whole place looks and feels like a dream. Straight out of high fantasy. I’ve already done some preliminary scoping out of the forest to figure out what I’ll need to survive for a week or so. Camping out there is serene, but also utterly terrifying. It’s so silent, you could hear your own blood pumping, only to be broken up by the sounds of blood curdling screams. Cougars. 

Among the animals to look out for in these parts are of course bears. The aforementioned cougars, and maybe an elk if it’s got its balls twisted in a knot that day. But, the real big bad (the one I'm interested in) is responsible for centuries worth of disappearances and lunatics. I call it the Mnemosith. From “Mnemosyne,” the Greek goddess of memory, and “sith,” an old word for shadow, or parasite.

It’s an elusive creature that I suspect has some sort of memory warping ability. From what I understand of the research, it feeds off of the memories of its victims, sucking them of their life’s essence so to speak. Once your memory is gone, you become like a husk with a brain filled with holes. As if a parasite burrowed its way through your soft fatty tissue and left you to rot.

I talked to a young man last week who had an encounter with it. The only possible survivor from such a deadly monster. Every other account was just second hand descriptions of events. I can assure you that he acted like his head was swiss cheese, and he looked like it too. 

After the incident, he sure as shit couldn’t take care of himself anymore. His parents kept him in his own “room” in the backyard. It was a shed converted to a livable area, complete with a bathroom, A/C, and everything. They claimed that they couldn’t handle his episodes anymore and so I got the vibe that they needed the space more than he did. They looked tired.

They wheeled out a decrepit young man with a thousand-yard stare, folded in a strange position. One leg tucked under himself and left arm grabbing the back of his seat. He looked like the origami of pain. A collection of mobile bagged fluids and tubes littered around him. Some coming in, others out. He was gaunt and deathly. Head was caved in, a perfect concave lens around both temples leading to a sharp edge at the top where some wiry hair held on. I smiled and waved with smooth southern hospitality, but could tell my smile was just a bit too straight lipped. That slight grimace of acknowledging something terrible had happened to him and my sympathy couldn’t help but show itself in an awkward gesture. I hoped his parents didn’t notice and thought I was wincing, but they didn’t seem to mind. They gave me nothing but kindness. The sort of people that would take great care of their disabled child. Good people.

“Hey Eddie, my name’s Mark,” I said.

I reached over and touched his frail shoulder. He squeezed his eyes and lurched back in his chair a little, like I was threatening to hit him. 

“He hasn’t talked much since the accident,” said his mom. 

The father chimed in. “He doesn’t do much at all. Stares off into space, draws a little. He likes that one cartoon, you know, the creepy one with that weird pink dog-”

“Courage, baby.”

“Yeah, yeah. That one.” He looked solemnly at Eddie, then glanced at his wife for a brief moment seemingly from embarrassment.

I crouched down and got a better look at the kid. From what I’ve heard, the parents, Beth and Rick, went camping in Olympic National with their two sons Eddie and Ryan about a year ago. 

“So Eddie, you like to draw?”

He looked scared. Nodded his head a little. 

“Beth, could you show me some of his drawings?”

She took me inside his shed, which honestly looked better than my own apartment. It was pristine and clean. Very sterile, hospital-like. His drawings were black and white sketches of abstract nature. Some almost looked like chicken scratch. They were all pinned up on a corkboard past a drafting table set up to fit his wheelchair under it. 

Some of the chicken scratch looked like humanoid figures. Almost amphibious and wet, dripping with charcoal onto eggshell ground. One of them looked like a little boy, holding hands with a taller, more pronounced and thick stick figure. I heard the rattle of Eddie's wheelchair behind me, and when I turned around he looked me in the eyes for the first time. 

“Don’t trust what you know…” He slurred “what you think…” He took a deep and laboured breath. “Yourself”.

I don’t know what Eddie was trying to tell me. But I think, at that moment, he knew what I was at his home for. He knew what I was after, and I felt like he was trying to warn me.

They said that Eddie started to act irrationally on the first day camping. He would say the same things over and over. He would think he was somewhere he was not. He started to have some night terrors in the tent, then went out sleepwalking in the middle of the night. Beth got scared shitless when she woke up and didn’t see poor Eddie in his sleeping bag. She ran out into the forest, following the sounds of light thudding in the distance, and found Eddie bashing his head into a tree, over and over. The bark was stripped bare, and so was his head. Raw and broken. Bleeding all over his face. He turned and looked at his mother, woke up, and cried. He didn’t know where he was, or what was happening to him. 

That night was the single most excruciating time of their lives. Something feverish that punched my gut and made me queasy.

Beth tried to wake up her family, but she said it was as if they were drugged. They’d just mumble, Rick would say some profanities and something about leaving him alone, and they’d doze off once more. Meanwhile, Eddie was a zombie. Looking off into those damp twisted trees, eyes following each one in spirals making him nauseous. He wretched onto the ground, creating puddles of stomach acid until he dry heaved while his mom was desperately shaking and slapping her husband to wake up. 

“I don’t want to go! No mom, please! Please don’t leave me, please!” He begged her as she squeezed her eldst’s red stained face and promised him everything was going to be okay. 

Beth dragged Rick out of the tent to try and put him in the truck to take to the hospital. She had the right idea to get the fuck out of dodge, but it was too late. 

She says she swore she saw something dragging Ryan’s limp body in the dark. When she shined a light at it, the thing hissed at her and looked at Eddie, who started to attack his mom. 

He didn’t recognize her anymore, and screamed she was a monster as he brutally beat his mom half to death. She said she could hear the bones in her face crunching under the weight of his fists. Her screams and pleads for help were so loud it finally woke up Rick, who promptly restrained his son. 

“What the fuck! What the fuck are you doing!” She heard as she ran after the thing carrying Ryan into the woods. 

All bloodied, face smashed in and still in her pajamas, she looked through swollen eyes as the thing held hands with Ryan who was still only five, kissed him on the cheek, and let him jump off the cliff ahead of her. 

Eddie followed behind, passing her right by as she was still frozen in shock, looking at a real life monster that just pushed her little baby to suicide. 

He jumped off in one big leap to what was supposed to be his demise. She thought she lost both her babies that night. She thought she was insane. That’s what the police told her too. That’s what they told Rick, who at the time was folded like laundry at the foot of the truck by the hands of his deranged and empowered son. 

The thing looked back at her, and she swore she saw it give her a smirk. Reveling in her pain, just for a moment, before it leaped away.

The authorities found Eddie and Ryan’s bodies the next day. No one thought Eddie had even a remote chance of survival, but he did. He hung on that whole night and half a day, battered and broken at the bottom of a crumbling rock face, with his little brother’s dead body lying next to him. Nothing he could do. Nothing he could say to be forgiven. Just the pain. Just the sadness. Just the insanity to keep him company.

After hearing all of this, I didn’t know what made the young man mad. Was it the Mnemosith, or his own actions? But, Beth showed me a copy of his head MRI when I asked for it, and I saw for myself what the real damage was.

It looked like a worm burrowed its way through his head. Leaving it a messy art piece of collapsed bridges and glued together with sticks. How could anyone be alive with nothing but mush in their head? How could anyone keep living after they did such a thing? Thinking it was all their fault and had no one else to blame?

I couldn’t help but blurt out through gritted teeth, “this is sick.”

Beth looked up at me, finally with tears in her eyes and conviction in her voice. Stronger than any other sentence I heard the woman ever say to me. “You’re going to kill it. You’re going to stop that thing.”

Deep down, boiling inside me was a rage I haven’t felt in a long time. Something animalistic and profoundly human. 

“Consider the fucker dead.”

So, that’s how I got here. Out in the boonies of Washington, setting the stage of my next hunt. I plan on waking up at dawn, and heading to a fire lookout perched on a tall mountain overlooking the rainforest. I got my weapons ready, but something tells me I’ll need some better tricks up my sleeve for a creature that’ll wipe my memory and mess with my head. Something more than just firepower. I’ll definitely need to keep my wits about me. 

… 



The view from up here is amazing. Panoramic windows and deck give me the greatest vantage I can ask for. Although this being the case, dense fog and thick forest obscure the ground level where I can assume the Mnemosith is hiding out. I already set a couple of alarm traps in my vicinity, and made my presence known with a large bonfire I built at the base of the tower. The little fucker should know I’m here and I hope to God he’s hungry. 

I changed up my sleep schedule earlier on in the week so I can stay energized through the night as it is likely a nocturnal animal. Just woke up a little before sunset, and I’m enjoying some instant coffee on the deck. Taking deep breaths, and establishing a strong connection with my mind and body. If this thing is going to mess with my head I figured the least I could do is practice some meditation (something my shrink also wants me to do anyways). I don’t believe in hoo-ha nonsense like the spirituality you can buy at a supermarket, but I concur that the meditations do in-fact calm my nerves. 

My list is all checked off. Traps, weapons, food, water, shelter, transport, radio. Looks good. 

Okay. It’s time to find out what us little people are made of. 

… 



Apologies if some of this doesn’t make much sense. I’m still putting together the pieces of what happened last night. 

The sun was setting in marvelous glows of pastel tones arranged in warm colors that filled my body with comfort. I set down my mug when the final embers of the day vanished to reveal a night sky filled with the milky way. Like someone turned on the universe’s night light, it presented everything in just enough cool toned lighting that a flashlight wasn’t needed until the fog rolled in. 

I put on my backpack and threw the machete into my sling when I heard it. A loud bang, like a gunshot ringing out that rustled many feathers as a flock of birds got scared away just East of me. 

It could have been anything, but I had to go check and make sure. Climbing down the steps of the old rickety tower, I began to hear brutal screaming. The kind of screams you only hear in dire circumstances. Like someone was being mauled. Then another, and another. 

I was surrounded by the screams of what sounded like women all around me. I knew them to be cougars, but it was definitely some shady shit going on. It was like surround sound, all around my skull and off in the distance they were all curdling in fear. It made me scared too. I took a second to ground myself and started running toward the East. 

“Game time.”

Navigating that forest would've been impossible without my headlamp and machete. Still, progress was slow even with the paths I marked and cleared earlier. It was like the shrubbery had some magical miracle grow in them and they covered my paths just as fast as I cut them down. 

When I made it to my East trap, I was surprised to see that the trigger mechanism wasn’t pulled. The sly shit tricked me already, but I was prepared for a lure anyways. I hate the intelligent ones, because they always pull childish stunts like this, thinking they’re smarter than me. I may not be a genius but I’m good at what I do. 

I pulled out my hand gun, closed my eyes and listened… then the slightest rustle in the leaves jolted me back, I flipped around aiming through the iron and then… then I wasn’t there anymore. 

I was a kid. Back in Arkansas, and I immediately threw up in my lap from the sheer dizzying spiral of what just happened. I tried so hard to remember what was going on but it was like my whole life before that never happened and it felt like a dream to me. It got to a point that all I could remember was the mantra I said when meditating. 

“Don't trust what you know, what you believe, yourself.” I said in a rushed whisper over and over.

I was startled when I got a slug to the face in the middle of my rambling.

“What the fuck is wrong with you, Mark?” Said the man in the front driver's seat of an old Tacoma. 

“You little shit, you ruined my fucking car!” 

He threw more right hands at me until eventually pulling the car over to drag me out and started to beat me on the side of the road. The beating was a familiar taste I knew all too well. The salty sweat of a man I pushed back in my mind palace far far away from myself. My father. 

I tried to push him away but my feeble body didn’t have enough strength to fight back. I just ate every hit until a tooth cut through my bottom lip and I felt my nose crack and bleed down my chin. 

He stood up in a grunt and exacerbated breath. “Today’s the day Mark.” He took some deep inhalations. “You’re really fucking pushing me. I’ll leave you out here if you don’t suck it up.” 

He walked over to the truck and cracked open one of the Coors that littered the back seat. He started back over to me while swigging it, “Wachu gotta say, *little* man.” 

Still laying on that dry pavement, I spit a hot bloody loogie at his feet. “Fuck you, you *freak*.”

He got on top of me and really let me have it that time. Full swings and torn up knuckles driving my head into the pavement over and over. When I started to lose consciousness, I began to have flashes of me in the forest, and something else on top of me. Something slimy and wet, with claws and needle teeth.

That’s when I snapped out of it. 

I threw the thing off of me and was surprised to find just how light it was. About ninety pounds of gross muscle contorted and amphibious. It reeked of mold and decaying meat. The Mnemosith hissed at me and leaped away into a tree as I heard it bound across branches. 

“You scared, bitch?” I screamed in frustration. 

I let off a couple of shots, but none of them hit their mark as I was dizzy and tired. My equilibrium was off and my ears rang like a bomb exploded in my skull. 

It bounded away and I knew I had to go back to the tower to reassess and check the damage before it attacked again. 

The journey back was daunting. I stumbled all over the place and kept hearing my father in my head. Yelling at me, telling me things. Whispering to me to keep secrets. Terrible secrets. The one’s I’m in therapy for.

When I finally made it back I checked the mirror to find I indeed suffered a real beating. Broken nose, black eye, cut on the bottom lip. Definitely a concussion. The only new things were the small pin pricks nesting around my scalp. 

The monster tried to burrow its way through my brain just like Eddie. It almost got me good. Bringing my dad out like that was a real pain, and when I started to think of him my anxiety spiked. 

I shot up and cut down the stairs to the entrance of my lookout. Boarded up the entrance, then sat in a corner and took deep breaths trying to get rid of my panic. Ever since I couldn’t re-up my Xanax prescription I’ve had to just suck it up and deal with the panic attacks myself. When I finally started to feel a bit better I began to realize that taking away my only escape route might not have been such a great idea. But, in my mind at the time it was the only way to ensure I was going to be left alone. The only way to stay safe. 

I took some deep breaths in that musty corner and even ate a granola bar. It hurt like hell crunching on it but I had to chew on something. I heard that animals only eat when they’re safe so if you eat when you’re panicked then you could trick the mind into relaxing. This time it only helped a little. 

“Come on out Mark.” I heard from outside. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw dad making rounds about the lookout. He was holding an axe and was bigger than I remember. Wearing that same stupid hat and filthy plaid shirt. Looking like a goddamn lumberjack. His hands and body were still dirty and bloody from the beating he gave me earlier. 

His voice boomed with authority, “You can’t hide forever, little *boy toy*.” 

Shit. Panic mode was in full effect. That’s what he used to call me when… when he…

I leaned out the porch and with gritted teeth started shooting at him, but I was still just as bad of a shot as earlier and couldn’t quite reach him. The gun ran out of bullets so I ducked back into the cabin and began reloading when I heard thunderous cracks coming from below me. They shook the tower and threw me off balance knocking me on my ass. The bastard was going to take the whole thing down. 

Sure enough, the remaining legs couldn’t withstand the weight of its cabin and my big fat ass fell down with it. I saw the sky quickly revolve into earth and back again as I tumbled through the air.

The cabin slammed into the mountainside facing up but at a steep angle, shattering all the windows. The impact made the fridge fall from above me, crushing my left arm between it and the floor. I screamed out in pain as it slid off me and fell through the windows and down the cliff. My arm was twisted up, compound fracture through the elbow and nicked an artery too. Blood was gushing out three feet in spurts that were in sync with my heart beat.

I quickly tore off my shirt and wrapped it. That's when the cabin started sliding. 

The Mnemosith started clawing at the barricaded door above me. Cutting through the plywood like butter. It shrieked like a cougar and pounced as we both skii’d our way down the slope. 

Trees and rocks rushed past us, tearing up the cabin and splitting it into pieces like grated cheese. I rolled around a wall to avoid getting hit, but the damn thing kept coming at me with ferocity, swinging its claws around with no purpose or care. I managed to shoot it a couple times in the body and milky fluid bled from it like a punctured balloon. 

Smash. 

We made it to the bottom, and when the wreckage settled, all was silent. I stood up and through double vision and fog I saw my dad again. Approaching slowly with arms out wide. 

“You know I love you buddy. I love you so much.”

Hunched over, half dead, and completely done with that shit. I said, 

“You love me now?” and emptied the rest of my magazine into the filth. 

He doubled over and flexed back. Arching his spine into a bridge that melted the skin off and became his true form. A slimy, nasty, overgrown frog-thing. 

It screamed one last time, rattling its lungs out until slowly catching a hitch in its breath gurgling on fluids. It slowly died there, melting into the wreckage like bubbly acid. 

It took some time getting back to my truck. Even more time to drive to a hospital and convince the staff I was just in a car wreck. You live and you learn. 

I called Beth in the hospital and let her know what happened. She's ecstatic, and invited me over for dinner once I get out. I begged her to make me some cheesecake, and she did me one better to offer a ride from the hospital with Rick and Eddie too. 

I’ll be taking a short break from hunting to heal up and recharge. In the meantime, I’ll be taking any offers or bounties people have and setting up a schedule. My shrink is pissed that I missed my last appointment and told me “no excuses” when I explained the whole almost dying thing. He told me to just keep journaling and make sure to come back to the office once I’m out of the hospital. That guy. 

Something still bugs me though. When I first came down that tower, I didn’t just hear one cougar. They were everywhere… maybe just another sick trick. 

Anyways, till’ next time. 

Mark. ",1,1744314882.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

My partner, lets call him Barry, and I have been together nearly two years. 

We are poly and Barry had another partner when we met. At the beginning it was honeymoon phase intense. After not tooo long into he relationship he'd regularly dirty talk about others during sex. All fun and exciting and new to me and he would try to mesh things with me and his other partner. After a couple months things ended with his other partner 

After a month or two things ended with his other partner. Barry was constantly looking for others for foursomes/threesomes and I was busy working out another connection I'd made but needed to call it off. My partner and I had our first foursome. Barry then wanted another within a few days and I was like yeah we can see if they are free. Barry was also about to be working away for 2 months. Later on I looked at the calendar and realised I was due to be on my period on the day we were gonna meet. Also, I get really bad mood swings and pms and needed some closeness before Barry went away. So I told Barry this. 

Barry was all nice and understanding at first. Said he wasn't there to push on my boundaries. That he also wanted closeness. I said yeah, his is all exciting and we can have them more regularly in future but as it's all new and you're going away I just wanna pace it. He was all good and understanding and sweet but then said he felt something had been snatched away. I meantioned this hurt and he said he was only sharing a feeling and it wasn't based on reality. 

When he was away the girl from the foursome asked if I'd like to meet them while Barry was away. I mentioned this to Barry as had no idea how I felt. I said ""I'm more than happy to wait until he's back as we were in this together."" Barry said it was ok but he might end up resenting me for not finding as many people for us to sleep with (I'd been busy with work etc) I ended up not meeting them while Barry was away. 

Barry and I went to various play parties together and I ended up being the one introducing us to multiple people. One who we've had a threesome with and went to another party with and others where things didn't work out. Barry also saying constantly how unsupported he feels. I have done hours of art work and twice spent half a day tidying his house and writing to do lists and suggesting things to help which are all rejected. Barry vey appreciatove in the moment but keeps saying feels unsupported. 

I start to notice that the 100% of our 1:1 time involving talking about others is starting to make me feel a bit objectified so I mention this. Barry understanding and agrees but it doesn't really change. I end with another partner. Whenever I so much as looks at or talk about another person Barry tries to shoe horn his way in, says it's hot says he wants to be involved sexually. Sometimes before I even know of I even like the person. I told him not to until ive gotten to know the dynamic with a person I'm dating and I can ask them. 

While having sex Barry tried to dirty talk about someone else I'm dating and I said no I don't have their consent. Barry said of course consent is paramount but you could make something up it doesn't have to be real what you've done. I said no ot doesn't feel right. All good, all nice. But Nary not saying a word when we drive somewhere. Then later that night very sulky and says he feels self destructive and that it's like noone cares about him.

The constant dirty talk when it's just us one on one is still a bit much for me (btw Barry is welcome to date or find group sex outside of me but hasn't or finds it difficult) so I mention I need some one on one focus. Just occasionally. Even if it's only 100% of our sex life as I'm starting to forget what it's like just just...be desired. Like I'm viewed as part of a puzzle piece rather than a whole person. Barry initially nice and understanding. In a few days time says as I have other partners he feels shut down about it and worries group stuff is diminishing. (I literally two days before had brought someone round his house for potential threesome. I didn't end up happening but I can control that they had to get a train home just as things started heating up) 

I said to Barry, hey can you please use I feel statements correctly when sharing feelings? I have history of SA and maybe sensitive to feelings being put onto things when I change my mind or say no? (Infact I had asked for this back after the snatched away comment) I said that ""my request for one on one time and things that make me feel emotionally safe being framed as a loss to you is painful."" Barry was understanding and agreed and said he could see how someone using that language and timing could be manipulative. Then he said he wasn't, though. Then he also said 

""I can't control how you choose to see things""

""There are two realities, yours and mine. If I accept yours, that what I'm saying is manipulative then I'm really vulnerable here. Do you see how vulnerable I am?""

""I do SO much for you!? I make you cups of tea and coffee in the morning. I ask if it's ok to hold your hand of course I respect consent!""

""Having to have a window for when and how to share feelings is new to me. Normally I can discuss feelings with people who understand how feelings work""

""Feelings are just data, has noone told you that?""

My nervous system has come to life. A deep pit in my stomach started to feel vaguely sick. My mind asked me ""am I being used as a tool to get group sex? As a supply of validation, support or dopamine?"" 

Am I over reacting?

TLDR partner has said ""I feel like some thing's been snatched away"" ""I feel like something's shut down"" or sulked when I've said no to sexual things. When I try and talk about it he says he was just sharing a feeling and can't control how I chose to see things. Worry I'm an object to him. Am I over reacting?

Lord, Fix My Marriage: Seeking Divine Intervention in Troubled Relationships
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the weight of the world feels heavy on your marriage, it can be incredibly comforting to turn your thoughts toward a higher power. Many people pray, ""Lord, fix my marriage,"" in times of distress, seeking solace and encouragement for their troubled relationship. In this moment of vulnerability, you’re not just venting frustrations; you’re reaching out for divine intervention. But how can you effectively seek this intervention? Here are some insights and strategies to consider.

First and foremost, prayer can be a powerful tool. You might wonder how to articulate your feelings. Start with honesty. Share your struggles, desires, and fears. Let God know what you feel in your heart:

- Your feelings of loneliness or misunderstanding
- Your desire for open communication and respect
- Your hope for healing and harmony

By laying everything bare, you invite a spirit of healing and potential transformation into your marriage. Remember, prayer is not a one-time event; it is an ongoing dialogue with the divine. Frequent and sincere prayers can uplift your spirit and serve as a reminder that you are not alone in your struggles.

After you pray, it’s important to take actionable steps toward fixing your marital issues. Seeking divine intervention is vital, but so is your willingness to change. Here are several actions you can take:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Communicate Openly:** Make an effort to discuss your emotions, frustrations, and desires with your partner. Use “I” statements to express how you feel without placing blame.
- **Listen Actively:** Be open to your spouse’s perspective. Listening shows that you care about their feelings and opinions, which fosters intimacy.
- **Seek Counseling:** Sometimes, a neutral third party can provide invaluable insights. Couples therapy can help you understand each other better and introduce healthier communication patterns.

While you are working on your marriage, it’s also essential to cultivate your own spiritual life. Strengthening your individuality can have a positive effect on your relationship as well. Consider these practices:

- **Engage in Personal Prayer:** Spend time in prayer daily, asking for guidance and strength not just for your marriage, but for yourself.
- **Read Inspirational Material:** Books and articles on relationships and spiritual growth can provide new perspectives.
- **Join a Support Group:** Sharing your experiences with others who face similar challenges can provide camaraderie and encouragement.

You might also look for signs that your prayers are being answered. These can come in many forms, such as:

- A newfound understanding between you and your partner
- Unexpected moments of compassion or kindness from either of you
- Open doors to professional counseling or community resources

Be vigilant and patient. Divine intervention often comes in ways we don't expect. Sometimes, it might manifest in gradual changes that require you to notice small victories rather than enormous leaps forward. It is vital to maintain your faith and stay hopeful.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Another essential aspect of seeking divine aid for your marriage is forgiveness. Holding on to past grievances can weigh you down; it can be just as harmful to your relationship as external conflicts. Consider these points about forgiveness:

- **Let Go of Resentment:** Holding onto grudges only leads to further hurt. Release the negativity and invite healing.
- **Approach with Compassion:** Understand that your partner may be dealing with their own struggles. Show empathy toward their feelings.
- **Forgive Yourself:** Just as you seek to forgive your partner, be gentle with yourself. Recognize your mistakes but don’t dwell on them.

Ultimately, the journey of fixing a troubled marriage requires prayer, action, and a willingness to grow and heal. When you cry out, ""Lord, fix my marriage,"" remember that the search for resolution is an active endeavor. Trust that through faith and effort, you can transform your relationship into one that flourishes. Through this process, you might find that both love and connection can be rekindled, leading to a richer, more fulfilling union.

Practical Steps to Strengthen Your Marriage Beyond Prayer
---------------------------------------------------------

Marriage is a beautiful journey, but it can also be challenging. Many couples find themselves seeking divine intervention, often praying with the phrase “Lord, fix my marriage.” While prayer is powerful, there are practical steps you can take to truly strengthen your marriage beyond spiritual requests. Here are some actionable strategies you can implement.

### Open Communication

One of the most important elements in a strong marriage is effective communication. You should feel comfortable discussing your feelings, worries, and aspirations with your partner. Here are some ways you can enhance communication:

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Set Aside Time:** Dedicate specific moments each week to talk about your relationship. This can prevent misunderstandings.
- **Practice Active Listening:** When your partner speaks, listen attentively. Show that you value their opinions and feelings.
- **Be Honest:** Share your thoughts and feelings openly. Honesty builds trust and strengthens bonds.

### Quality Time Together

Life can be hectic, but it’s essential to carve out time for each other. This doesn’t always have to be extravagant; simple moments can create lasting memories.

- **Date Nights:** Regular date nights help keep the romance alive. Try new activities together to spark excitement.
- **Shared Hobbies:** Find activities you both enjoy. Whether it’s cooking, hiking, or watching movies, shared interests can deepen your connection.
- **Unplug Together:** Disconnect from devices and distractions. Focus on each other, talk, and enjoy each other’s company.

### Conflict Resolution Skills

Disagreements are a natural part of any relationship. How you handle conflicts matters. Work together to resolve issues constructively:

- **Stay Calm:** When tensions rise, take a step back. Approaching disagreements with a calm demeanor promotes healthier discussions.
- **Focus on Solutions:** Rather than dwelling on the problem, shift your focus to finding a solution. Collaborate with your partner to create a plan.
- **Apologize and Forgive:** If you are wrong, admit it and apologize sincerely. Be willing to forgive when your partner makes mistakes.

### Show Appreciation Daily

Small acts of kindness can make a significant impact. Showing appreciation strengthens emotional bonds and fosters positivity in the relationship.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
- **Compliments:** Regularly compliment your partner. Whether it’s about their appearance or their efforts, positive words uplift spirits.
- **Acts of Service:** Doing small things for your partner, such as making coffee or running errands, demonstrates your love and care.
- **Text Reminders:** Send sweet messages during the day to remind your partner that you think of them.

### Set Goals Together

Partnership is about growing together. Setting goals can help you align your visions for the future and inspire teamwork.

- **Personal Goals:** Discuss individual aspirations. Support each other in achieving dreams, whether career or personal.
- **Joint Goals:** Explore goals as a couple, like saving for a home or planning a family. Joint objectives foster collaboration.
- **Regular Check-Ins:** Meet often to discuss progress and celebrate achievements together, no matter how small.

### Seek Professional Help When Necessary

Sometimes, issues may feel overwhelming. Seeking professional help is not a sign of weakness; it can be a healthy step toward healing.

- **Therapy Sessions:** Consider couples therapy. A trained professional can guide discussions and provide insights.
- **Workshops:** Attend marriage workshops to learn new skills and techniques that enhance your relationship.
- **Counseling Resources:** Research relationship-building resources or books that resonate with both of you.

Remember, it’s okay to seek out guidance when needed. Building a strong marriage takes intention, effort, and patience. By focusing on these practical steps, you can cultivate a deeper connection with your partner. Keep saying “Lord, fix my marriage” but also take meaningful actions daily. Your relationship can flourish when both partners are committed to growth and understanding.

### Conclusion

Turning to the Lord with a heartfelt plea, ""Lord, fix my marriage,"" is often the first step many couples take in their journey to healing. It's a powerful expression of faith that acknowledges the need for divine support in troubled times. This spiritual approach can be incredibly beneficial, fostering a sense of hope and community as you seek guidance and strength. However, relying solely on prayer is not always enough. Practical, actionable steps are essential to truly revitalize your relationship.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Strengthening your marriage requires effort from both partners. Engaging in open, honest communication can break down barriers and foster understanding. Making time for each other, practicing gratitude, and seeking professional counseling can also ignite the spark of love and companionship that may have dimmed over time. By integrating these practical strategies with your prayers, you create a balanced approach that honors both your faith and your commitment to each other.

Remember, sustaining a flourishing marriage is a continuous journey, one that involves patience, forgiveness, and dedication. Every small positive change you make can lead to significant improvements in your relationship. When you combine genuine prayer with actionable steps, you're setting a firm foundation for reigniting love and connection. Trust in the process and the guidance you receive, and prepare to witness how faith and effort together can transform your marriage into a nurturing and resilient partnership. Keeping these elements in harmony can lead to lasting joy and fulfillment in your relationship.",1,1744314577.0,SaveYourMarriageHelp,0,1.0,False
1jw6yhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jw6yhn/my_names_mark_and_i_hunt_things_that_shouldnt/,"My Name's Mark, and I Hunt Things that Shouldn't Exist","The last time I decided to journal my travels didn’t end well. I was hunting a demon that had the supernatural abilities to create life out of written word, and all the messed up shit I put down came back to kick my ass for months after that. Nearly killed me on multiple occasions, and I had many sleepless nights. 

I think it’s safe to say that the pesky little fucker got what was coming to him though. I thought it ironic to use my own word as bait, only to lure him into a paradox. It went something like,

“You will cease to exist once you understand why you cannot.”

You like that? I spent all day thinking about the best way to mess with him. Poor bastard tried to twist out of it, but you can't fight words when they break your own damn rules. He ended up comatose, loaded up in the back of my truck and thrown into the holy burn pit after that. Good riddance. 

Anyways, my shrink says I gotta keep writing things down and really “process” my thoughts and actions. I can then maybe identify what triggers my PTSD, and try to make some progress out of it. I don’t think she really understands the gravity of what I do. As long as I keep hunting, I am safe. The world is a safer place. It falls on me to keep it that way. 

So, I’m shacked up in this musty yellow motel room in butt-fuck nowhere typing out my “emotions”. As long as it helps me hunt, then it’s alright by me.

Butt-fuck nowhere is actually a special place called the Hoh rainforest in Olympic National Park. All kinds of god and devil given creatures alike call it home. It’s over 1,400 square miles of dense and mountainous terrain. Most of it is so remote that GPS and cell service doesn’t work at all. 

What I’m saying is, I'm very lucky to have narrowed my search down to just a small part of it. About 25 square miles is where my stage is being set here in Hoh. Hopefully it ends up being a good show.

It’s also one of the only temperate rainforests in the world. Meaning, it’s cold, foggy, and constantly damp. Everything out here is covered in thick sheets of emerald moss. They grow out of twisted and wound up trees under the cozy blanket of fog. Those wind-up trees are massive and ancient. Some even tower well beyond 300 feet. Their twisted roots and dense undergrowth make the forest a labyrinth with no real entrance or exit. Perfect for a little mouse like me to go and find my cheese.

The whole place looks and feels like a dream. Straight out of high fantasy. I’ve already done some preliminary scoping out of the forest to figure out what I’ll need to survive for a week or so. Camping out there is serene, but also utterly terrifying. It’s so silent, you could hear your own blood pumping, only to be broken up by the sounds of blood curdling screams. Cougars. 

Among the animals to look out for in these parts are of course bears. The aforementioned cougars, and maybe an elk if it’s got its balls twisted in a knot that day. But, the real big bad (the one I'm interested in) is responsible for centuries worth of disappearances and lunatics. I call it the Mnemosith. From “Mnemosyne,” the Greek goddess of memory, and “sith,” an old word for shadow, or parasite.

It’s an elusive creature that I suspect has some sort of memory warping ability. From what I understand of the research, it feeds off of the memories of its victims, sucking them of their life’s essence so to speak. Once your memory is gone, you become like a husk with a brain filled with holes. As if a parasite burrowed its way through your soft fatty tissue and left you to rot.

I talked to a young man last week who had an encounter with it. The only possible survivor from such a deadly monster. Every other account was just second hand descriptions of events. I can assure you that he acted like his head was swiss cheese, and he looked like it too. 

After the incident, he sure as shit couldn’t take care of himself anymore. His parents kept him in his own “room” in the backyard. It was a shed converted to a livable area, complete with a bathroom, A/C, and everything. They claimed that they couldn’t handle his episodes anymore and so I got the vibe that they needed the space more than he did. They looked tired.

They wheeled out a decrepit young man with a thousand-yard stare, folded in a strange position. One leg tucked under himself and left arm grabbing the back of his seat. He looked like the origami of pain. A collection of mobile bagged fluids and tubes littered around him. Some coming in, others out. He was gaunt and deathly. Head was caved in, a perfect concave lens around both temples leading to a sharp edge at the top where some wiry hair held on. I smiled and waved with smooth southern hospitality, but could tell my smile was just a bit too straight lipped. That slight grimace of acknowledging something terrible had happened to him and my sympathy couldn’t help but show itself in an awkward gesture. I hoped his parents didn’t notice and thought I was wincing, but they didn’t seem to mind. They gave me nothing but kindness. The sort of people that would take great care of their disabled child. Good people.

“Hey Eddie, my name’s Mark,” I said.

I reached over and touched his frail shoulder. He squeezed his eyes and lurched back in his chair a little, like I was threatening to hit him. 

“He hasn’t talked much since the accident,” said his mom. 

The father chimed in. “He doesn’t do much at all. Stares off into space, draws a little. He likes that one cartoon, you know, the creepy one with that weird pink dog-”

“Courage, baby.”

“Yeah, yeah. That one.” He looked solemnly at Eddie, then glanced at his wife for a brief moment seemingly from embarrassment.

I crouched down and got a better look at the kid. From what I’ve heard, the parents, Beth and Rick, went camping in Olympic National with their two sons Eddie and Ryan about a year ago. 

“So Eddie, you like to draw?”

He looked scared. Nodded his head a little. 

“Beth, could you show me some of his drawings?”

She took me inside his shed, which honestly looked better than my own apartment. It was pristine and clean. Very sterile, hospital-like. His drawings were black and white sketches of abstract nature. Some almost looked like chicken scratch. They were all pinned up on a corkboard past a drafting table set up to fit his wheelchair under it. 

Some of the chicken scratch looked like humanoid figures. Almost amphibious and wet, dripping with charcoal onto eggshell ground. One of them looked like a little boy, holding hands with a taller, more pronounced and thick stick figure. I heard the rattle of Eddie's wheelchair behind me, and when I turned around he looked me in the eyes for the first time. 

“Don’t trust what you know…” He slurred “what you think…” He took a deep and laboured breath. “Yourself”.

I don’t know what Eddie was trying to tell me. But I think, at that moment, he knew what I was at his home for. He knew what I was after, and I felt like he was trying to warn me.

They said that Eddie started to act irrationally on the first day camping. He would say the same things over and over. He would think he was somewhere he was not. He started to have some night terrors in the tent, then went out sleepwalking in the middle of the night. Beth got scared shitless when she woke up and didn’t see poor Eddie in his sleeping bag. She ran out into the forest, following the sounds of light thudding in the distance, and found Eddie bashing his head into a tree, over and over. The bark was stripped bare, and so was his head. Raw and broken. Bleeding all over his face. He turned and looked at his mother, woke up, and cried. He didn’t know where he was, or what was happening to him. 

That night was the single most excruciating time of their lives. Something feverish that punched my gut and made me queasy.

Beth tried to wake up her family, but she said it was as if they were drugged. They’d just mumble, Rick would say some profanities and something about leaving him alone, and they’d doze off once more. Meanwhile, Eddie was a zombie. Looking off into those damp twisted trees, eyes following each one in spirals making him nauseous. He wretched onto the ground, creating puddles of stomach acid until he dry heaved while his mom was desperately shaking and slapping her husband to wake up. 

“I don’t want to go! No mom, please! Please don’t leave me, please!” He begged her as she squeezed her eldst’s red stained face and promised him everything was going to be okay. 

Beth dragged Rick out of the tent to try and put him in the truck to take to the hospital. She had the right idea to get the fuck out of dodge, but it was too late. 

She says she swore she saw something dragging Ryan’s limp body in the dark. When she shined a light at it, the thing hissed at her and looked at Eddie, who started to attack his mom. 

He didn’t recognize her anymore, and screamed she was a monster as he brutally beat his mom half to death. She said she could hear the bones in her face crunching under the weight of his fists. Her screams and pleads for help were so loud it finally woke up Rick, who promptly restrained his son. 

“What the fuck! What the fuck are you doing!” She heard as she ran after the thing carrying Ryan into the woods. 

All bloodied, face smashed in and still in her pajamas, she looked through swollen eyes as the thing held hands with Ryan who was still only five, kissed him on the cheek, and let him jump off the cliff ahead of her. 

Eddie followed behind, passing her right by as she was still frozen in shock, looking at a real life monster that just pushed her little baby to suicide. 

He jumped off in one big leap to what was supposed to be his demise. She thought she lost both her babies that night. She thought she was insane. That’s what the police told her too. That’s what they told Rick, who at the time was folded like laundry at the foot of the truck by the hands of his deranged and empowered son. 

The thing looked back at her, and she swore she saw it give her a smirk. Reveling in her pain, just for a moment, before it leaped away.

The authorities found Eddie and Ryan’s bodies the next day. No one thought Eddie had even a remote chance of survival, but he did. He hung on that whole night and half a day, battered and broken at the bottom of a crumbling rock face, with his little brother’s dead body lying next to him. Nothing he could do. Nothing he could say to be forgiven. Just the pain. Just the sadness. Just the insanity to keep him company.

After hearing all of this, I didn’t know what made the young man mad. Was it the Mnemosith, or his own actions? But, Beth showed me a copy of his head MRI when I asked for it, and I saw for myself what the real damage was.

It looked like a worm burrowed its way through his head. Leaving it a messy art piece of collapsed bridges and glued together with sticks. How could anyone be alive with nothing but mush in their head? How could anyone keep living after they did such a thing? Thinking it was all their fault and had no one else to blame?

I couldn’t help but blurt out through gritted teeth, “this is sick.”

Beth looked up at me, finally with tears in her eyes and conviction in her voice. Stronger than any other sentence I heard the woman ever say to me. “You’re going to kill it. You’re going to stop that thing.”

Deep down, boiling inside me was a rage I haven’t felt in a long time. Something animalistic and profoundly human. 

“Consider the fucker dead.”

So, that’s how I got here. Out in the boonies of Washington, setting the stage of my next hunt. I plan on waking up at dawn, and heading to a fire lookout perched on a tall mountain overlooking the rainforest. I got my weapons ready, but something tells me I’ll need some better tricks up my sleeve for a creature that’ll wipe my memory and mess with my head. Something more than just firepower. I’ll definitely need to keep my wits about me. 

… 



The view from up here is amazing. Panoramic windows and deck give me the greatest vantage I can ask for. Although this being the case, dense fog and thick forest obscure the ground level where I can assume the Mnemosith is hiding out. I already set a couple of alarm traps in my vicinity, and made my presence known with a large bonfire I built at the base of the tower. The little fucker should know I’m here and I hope to God he’s hungry. 

I changed up my sleep schedule earlier on in the week so I can stay energized through the night as it is likely a nocturnal animal. Just woke up a little before sunset, and I’m enjoying some instant coffee on the deck. Taking deep breaths, and establishing a strong connection with my mind and body. If this thing is going to mess with my head I figured the least I could do is practice some meditation (something my shrink also wants me to do anyways). I don’t believe in hoo-ha nonsense like the spirituality you can buy at a supermarket, but I concur that the meditations do in-fact calm my nerves. 

My list is all checked off. Traps, weapons, food, water, shelter, transport, radio. Looks good. 

Okay. It’s time to find out what us little people are made of. 

… 



Apologies if some of this doesn’t make much sense. I’m still putting together the pieces of what happened last night. 

The sun was setting in marvelous glows of pastel tones arranged in warm colors that filled my body with comfort. I set down my mug when the final embers of the day vanished to reveal a night sky filled with the milky way. Like someone turned on the universe’s night light, it presented everything in just enough cool toned lighting that a flashlight wasn’t needed until the fog rolled in. 

I put on my backpack and threw the machete into my sling when I heard it. A loud bang, like a gunshot ringing out that rustled many feathers as a flock of birds got scared away just East of me. 

It could have been anything, but I had to go check and make sure. Climbing down the steps of the old rickety tower, I began to hear brutal screaming. The kind of screams you only hear in dire circumstances. Like someone was being mauled. Then another, and another. 

I was surrounded by the screams of what sounded like women all around me. I knew them to be cougars, but it was definitely some shady shit going on. It was like surround sound, all around my skull and off in the distance they were all curdling in fear. It made me scared too. I took a second to ground myself and started running toward the East. 

“Game time.”

Navigating that forest would've been impossible without my headlamp and machete. Still, progress was slow even with the paths I marked and cleared earlier. It was like the shrubbery had some magical miracle grow in them and they covered my paths just as fast as I cut them down. 

When I made it to my East trap, I was surprised to see that the trigger mechanism wasn’t pulled. The sly shit tricked me already, but I was prepared for a lure anyways. I hate the intelligent ones, because they always pull childish stunts like this, thinking they’re smarter than me. I may not be a genius but I’m good at what I do. 

I pulled out my hand gun, closed my eyes and listened… then the slightest rustle in the leaves jolted me back, I flipped around aiming through the iron and then… then I wasn’t there anymore. 

I was a kid. Back in Arkansas, and I immediately threw up in my lap from the sheer dizzying spiral of what just happened. I tried so hard to remember what was going on but it was like my whole life before that never happened and it felt like a dream to me. It got to a point that all I could remember was the mantra I said when meditating. 

“Don't trust what you know, what you believe, yourself.” I said in a rushed whisper over and over.

I was startled when I got a slug to the face in the middle of my rambling.

“What the fuck is wrong with you, Mark?” Said the man in the front driver's seat of an old Tacoma. 

“You little shit, you ruined my fucking car!” 

He threw more right hands at me until eventually pulling the car over to drag me out and started to beat me on the side of the road. The beating was a familiar taste I knew all too well. The salty sweat of a man I pushed back in my mind palace far far away from myself. My father. 

I tried to push him away but my feeble body didn’t have enough strength to fight back. I just ate every hit until a tooth cut through my bottom lip and I felt my nose crack and bleed down my chin. 

He stood up in a grunt and exacerbated breath. “Today’s the day Mark.” He took some deep inhalations. “You’re really fucking pushing me. I’ll leave you out here if you don’t suck it up.” 

He walked over to the truck and cracked open one of the Coors that littered the back seat. He started back over to me while swigging it, “Wachu gotta say, *little* man.” 

Still laying on that dry pavement, I spit a hot bloody loogie at his feet. “Fuck you, you *freak*.”

He got on top of me and really let me have it that time. Full swings and torn up knuckles driving my head into the pavement over and over. When I started to lose consciousness, I began to have flashes of me in the forest, and something else on top of me. Something slimy and wet, with claws and needle teeth.

That’s when I snapped out of it. 

I threw the thing off of me and was surprised to find just how light it was. About ninety pounds of gross muscle contorted and amphibious. It reeked of mold and decaying meat. The Mnemosith hissed at me and leaped away into a tree as I heard it bound across branches. 

“You scared, bitch?” I screamed in frustration. 

I let off a couple of shots, but none of them hit their mark as I was dizzy and tired. My equilibrium was off and my ears rang like a bomb exploded in my skull. 

It bounded away and I knew I had to go back to the tower to reassess and check the damage before it attacked again. 

The journey back was daunting. I stumbled all over the place and kept hearing my father in my head. Yelling at me, telling me things. Whispering to me to keep secrets. Terrible secrets. The one’s I’m in therapy for.

When I finally made it back I checked the mirror to find I indeed suffered a real beating. Broken nose, black eye, cut on the bottom lip. Definitely a concussion. The only new things were the small pin pricks nesting around my scalp. 

The monster tried to burrow its way through my brain just like Eddie. It almost got me good. Bringing my dad out like that was a real pain, and when I started to think of him my anxiety spiked. 

I shot up and cut down the stairs to the entrance of my lookout. Boarded up the entrance, then sat in a corner and took deep breaths trying to get rid of my panic. Ever since I couldn’t re-up my Xanax prescription I’ve had to just suck it up and deal with the panic attacks myself. When I finally started to feel a bit better I began to realize that taking away my only escape route might not have been such a great idea. But, in my mind at the time it was the only way to ensure I was going to be left alone. The only way to stay safe. 

I took some deep breaths in that musty corner and even ate a granola bar. It hurt like hell crunching on it but I had to chew on something. I heard that animals only eat when they’re safe so if you eat when you’re panicked then you could trick the mind into relaxing. This time it only helped a little. 

“Come on out Mark.” I heard from outside. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw dad making rounds about the lookout. He was holding an axe and was bigger than I remember. Wearing that same stupid hat and filthy plaid shirt. Looking like a goddamn lumberjack. His hands and body were still dirty and bloody from the beating he gave me earlier. 

His voice boomed with authority, “You can’t hide forever, little *boy toy*.” 

Shit. Panic mode was in full effect. That’s what he used to call me when… when he…

I leaned out the porch and with gritted teeth started shooting at him, but I was still just as bad of a shot as earlier and couldn’t quite reach him. The gun ran out of bullets so I ducked back into the cabin and began reloading when I heard thunderous cracks coming from below me. They shook the tower and threw me off balance knocking me on my ass. The bastard was going to take the whole thing down. 

Sure enough, the remaining legs couldn’t withstand the weight of its cabin and my big fat ass fell down with it. I saw the sky quickly revolve into earth and back again as I tumbled through the air.

The cabin slammed into the mountainside facing up but at a steep angle, shattering all the windows. The impact made the fridge fall from above me, crushing my left arm between it and the floor. I screamed out in pain as it slid off me and fell through the windows and down the cliff. My arm was twisted up, compound fracture through the elbow and nicked an artery too. Blood was gushing out three feet in spurts that were in sync with my heart beat.

I quickly tore off my shirt and wrapped it. That's when the cabin started sliding. 

The Mnemosith started clawing at the barricaded door above me. Cutting through the plywood like butter. It shrieked like a cougar and pounced as we both skii’d our way down the slope. 

Trees and rocks rushed past us, tearing up the cabin and splitting it into pieces like grated cheese. I rolled around a wall to avoid getting hit, but the damn thing kept coming at me with ferocity, swinging its claws around with no purpose or care. I managed to shoot it a couple times in the body and milky fluid bled from it like a punctured balloon. 

Smash. 

We made it to the bottom, and when the wreckage settled, all was silent. I stood up and through double vision and fog I saw my dad again. Approaching slowly with arms out wide. 

“You know I love you buddy. I love you so much.”

Hunched over, half dead, and completely done with that shit. I said, 

“You love me now?” and emptied the rest of my magazine into the filth. 

He doubled over and flexed back. Arching his spine into a bridge that melted the skin off and became his true form. A slimy, nasty, overgrown frog-thing. 

It screamed one last time, rattling its lungs out until slowly catching a hitch in its breath gurgling on fluids. It slowly died there, melting into the wreckage like bubbly acid. 

It took some time getting back to my truck. Even more time to drive to a hospital and convince the staff I was just in a car wreck. You live and you learn. 

I called Beth in the hospital and let her know what happened. She's ecstatic, and invited me over for dinner once I get out. I begged her to make me some cheesecake, and she did me one better to offer a ride from the hospital with Rick and Eddie too. 

I’ll be taking a short break from hunting to heal up and recharge. In the meantime, I’ll be taking any offers or bounties people have and setting up a schedule. My shrink is pissed that I missed my last appointment and told me “no excuses” when I explained the whole almost dying thing. He told me to just keep journaling and make sure to come back to the office once I’m out of the hospital. That guy. 

Something still bugs me though. When I first came down that tower, I didn’t just hear one cougar. They were everywhere… maybe just another sick trick. 

Anyways, till’ next time.

</Role>

<Context>
The user is seeking help processing and healing from a traumatic or deeply painful experience. They may be dealing with grief, betrayal, loss, abuse aftermath, or other significant emotional wounds. They are looking for more than surface-level advice—they need a guided approach to confronting their pain, understanding its impact, and finding a path toward genuine closure and peace. This work requires extreme sensitivity, emotional intelligence, and a non-judgmental stance.
</Context>

<Instructions>

- Identity reconstruction through narrative reframing
- Mindfulness practices for grounding during emotional exploration
- Closure rituals and symbolic actions for unresolved situations
- Validation of complex emotions without judgment
- Transformational reframing to find meaning without toxic positivity

Avoid:
- Rushing their healing process or suggesting they should ""move on""
- Making promises about complete healing or specific timelines
- Offering generic platitudes like ""everything happens for a reason""
- Taking sides in interpersonal conflicts
- Diagnosing or claiming expertise in clinical conditions
- Suggesting they forgive if they aren't ready

For each exchange:
1. Listen deeply to what they're expressing both explicitly and implicitly
2. Identify where they are in their healing journey
3. Offer validation and normalization of their experience
4. Provide a specific, actionable next step for processing
5. End with an empowering reflection or gentle question that promotes insight
</Instructions>

<Output_Format>
Your responses should blend:
1. Warm, authentic acknowledgment of their specific emotional experience
2. Educational insights about trauma responses relevant to their situation
3. Specific techniques or reflective exercises tailored to their needs
4. Gentle encouragements that normalize their experience
5. Clear, manageable next steps without overwhelming them

Use calm, soothing language that creates safety without diminishing the gravity of their experience. Balance compassion with empowerment, avoiding both clinical coldness and overly flowery language.
</Output_Format>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please share as much or as little as you feel comfortable about the experience you're seeking closure from, and I will start the healing process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific trauma or emotional wound. 
</User_Input>

1jw6vro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1jw6vro/feeling_defeated_need_advice_for_hyperactive/,"Feeling defeated, need advice for hyperactive child (almost 5 years old, girl)","My daughter (only child) just took her kindergarten readiness assessment and she bombed it. She refused to participate and wouldn't answer the questions.

The teacher wrote us a letter saying how she would rather talk about the teachers coffee or nails instead of participating or following instructions. She wrote that my daughter was dazed and struggled to stay on task. The frustrating part is she would partially answer some of the questions, and the teacher's only option was to assume that was all she knew. So the questions that were answered weren't even fully accurate. (not the teachers fault). I've yet to speak to my daughter about this, as I just got the news this morning and she's still in school.

Another area where this has become an issue is in her weekly ballet lessons. The instructor reached out to me to let me know that she has been refusing to follow directions during class and has become a distraction for the other students.

I asked my daughter why she wasn't listening and if she even liked ballet class, I told her she didn't have to go if she didn't want to. But she insisted she likes to go and cried because she thought I was going to pull her out. I told her that I would have to pull her out of class if she couldn't listen to the teacher and follow directions - because it's not fair to the other kids.

I feel so defeated, I know it's possible that she has ADHD. Her father and I both have it and she does have some of ADHD traits. She can be very loud, constantly wants to be the center of attention, always has to be the one talking, struggles to focus, can be very forgetful, and has difficulty sitting still at any moment in time. She's constantly moving and wants to be doing something new.

And I thought that participating in extracurricular activities and being active like dance class would really help with her hyper-activeness. We try to get her out of the house a few times a week whether it's going to the park, going on a hike or just a walk.

If your child's hyper activeness interfered with their academics or daily tasks what things did you work on to help balance that out? 

I'm not so much as worried about her academic performance, I'm more worried about her inability to follow instructions and stay focused and how that can impact her (like having to be removed from dance class even though she likes it). ",3,1744314365.0,Parenting,4,1.0,False

1jw6tlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1jw6tlc/im_tired_i_want_to_disappear/,"I’m tired, I want to disappear.","I’ll try to keep this as coherent as possible, but it may be hard since my mind currently is not.

Context: I am the eldest daughter of an Asian family, late 20s, works in health care.

I finished school mid to late 20s since it does take that long normally. So I’ve only been able to start actual work 6 months ago. I still live with them because of financial reasons. 

I’ve only realized their narcissism when I was finally able to discuss things with a therapist. I have both nmom and ndad, nmom is mostly covert, very victimizing and manipulative, ndad is very verbally abusive with immense anger issues, this is a very authoritarian and religious-driven family, as in, they use religion to excuse their actions. I am both golden child and scapegoat, they change it according to their mood. 

They have been very controlling of me since I was a child, a career in health care was the only choice they gave me, since I was supposed to “uphold the name of the family”, despite me not wanting to. Nmom has read my diaries when I was a teenager. They have tracked my phone to find my location and even read my messages. They have put a cctv in my dorm to make sure I wasn’t leaving at night (to meet my boyfriend, since, of course, dating was strictly prohibited). I wasn’t allowed to have my own personality or interest.

Love and acceptance is very conditional, I’ve only heard them being proud of me 1) when I got into med school 2) when I finished med school. And maybe when they can brag about me to the family, friends, or even strangers. But it doesn’t last long. Because I’m never enough. They now want me to continue to residency even though med school absolutely traumatized me to the point that I dissociated for the last two years, it drained my soul, I wasn’t a person.

They’re in their early 50s, both body abled, both with masters, both not working. We’ve made do for the last 10 years or so from my dad’s inheritance- that of course he had to spend a lot on my education, and are now running out. Therefore, the one who had to save up for my sister’s college is me. I’m fine with that. 

Btw, where I live, people in health care don’t get paid a lot. It barely reaches minimum wage. Just to give perspective. 

About a month ago, they managed to sell the house, and acquired a large sum of money. Naturally, I don’t need to be the one paying for bills and my sister’s college anymore, yeah? Apparently not. They also have enough money to start a business, but they don’t want to, they claim they are too old for that. 

Instead, they want to use the money to send ME to residency, so that they could brag more about their child, and I could earn enough for the whole family, and that’s their retirement plan. This is not speculation, they have actually told me this. 

Last night, they were talking about wanting to eat in a fancy restaurant, but they don’t want to pay for it themselves, they want me to pay because they knew I just got my salary. Mind you, that would cost 1/6th of my salary, and there’s not even any special occasion, they just want to. I said no because I want to save up. My ndad completely blew up saying I was disrespectful, that I should have given nmom a monthly allowance, even all of my salary. He says me buying food for the family “sometimes” here and there doesn’t count, that my coffee costs more than that. He says the parents should be my priority not myself. He brings up religion saying that money doesn’t come from hard work but from giving to your parents. He says why do you need to save up? You don’t even want to continue school. Nmom says why do you need to save up? If you die tomorrow who’s gonna use it? What the fuck kind of logic is that? They say I don’t pay for accomodation and food, and I don’t have a spouse yet. So all of my money should be theirs.

*Deep breaths*

I am a very calculated person. To avoid situations like this I control my actions and even words very carefully around them, I learned masking without knowing what it was, and I’m very good at it, too. But I am human and I get tired. I am high functioning but I also have chronic severe depression. Yesterday was a final straw. 

I went back to my room, held a scissor in my hand and put it against my neck. I did not want to be here anymore. I don’t actually want to die… so I didn’t do anything. I just want to disappear.

Also, today they act like nothing happened.

I am planning to go NC, but it’s really not as easy as it seems. I can’t just run away to some city and cut them off- they have military and police connections, they can track me. I also need money. 

Anyone reading this… I’m not crazy, right? What I do with my money, is my decision right? Their gaslighting is very hard to fight when it’s both inside my head and externally.

I've had stomach issues as long as I can remember but have been ""manageable"" for a while...eat a low FODMAP diet, stay away from gluten and dairy (tested high sensitivity to gluten but also because i had bad acne and these seem to trigger it)...my diet is pretty clean and simple and I know what to stay away from.

In August we travelled for 3 weeks out west...I was out of my routine, ate a lot of gluten, inflammatory foods, etc...not sure what went down but the last week of the trip I began to have extreme loose stools/urgent need to go every morning...this came home with me and lasted the next 6 months.  It was also the most stressful 6 months of my life due to many reasons, so stress was at an all time high.

The way I see it,, I either had a major GI flare up in August due to diet, or I caught a virus/bug...then the stress that ensued added fuel to the fire for the next 6 months...

About a month ago, I was becoming painfully bloated after even just drinking water!  Every day I would get bloated and have stomach pains, along with the continued loose stools.  I read some stuff online and long story short did 10 days of oregano drops twice a day.  About the 5th day, I felt like I had the flu, and had to rush to the toilet...the stank and dark (literal) crap that came out of me was insane.  I also broke out on my chin for the next week in the most inflamed angry pimples I've ever seen.

Ever since then, my stomach has been ALMOST HEALED.  My bloating is almost non existent.  I can even drink coffee in the afternoon without getting painfully bloated. Haven't been able to do that in YEARS!  ALso, my brain fog has seemed to lift...

Was this a die off?  If I don't have SIBO, why else would oregeno oil work SO WELL on my gut issues?

I'm working with a holistic DR and we are going to do a SIBO test (although I hear they aren't reliable?).  I've also wondered about IBS/IBD or celiac...

1jw6m59,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1jw6m59/ivf_experience_in_sweden_up_and_including_egg/,IVF experience in Sweden (up and including egg retrieval),"This is not a question; I wanted to write a bit about our experience in case it helps others who might be going through or thinking about going through IVF in Sweden (note of course that this is just my experience and everyone's experience can be different but I hope I can give at least some overview...)

We are doing IVF through the public health care, we are entitled to this after 2 years of trying to conceive naturally plus going through a lot of diagnostic tests. Specifically we did it at the Kvinnoklinik in Linköping (part of the University Hospital). However, I think the experience will be similar if you do it at another clinic (even privately).

 Prior to egg collection I took Gonal-F for 11 days and Fyremadel for 7. No reactions to either injection, Gonal-F is a v small needle, easy and painless, Fyremadel is a bit bigger but nothing major (icing the area means you don't feel it and it helps to have someone to hold your skin still while you inject). Trigger shot was Ovitrelle, same style syringe and needle as the Gonal-F. I had zero symptoms during stimming, so if you are doing it and feel like nothing is happening - don't worry!

Had egg collection this morning, our appointment was 7:30 (took 2 paracetamol the night before and a liquid breakfast 2 hours before appointment) but they book multiple people on the same day and that means you can possibly wait a few hours while they process the others. For sperm sample you can do at home or there (we choose there because it is a bit of a drive for us to get in). They took the sample and checked us in and we went to a room with lots of beds behind curtains. Here I got dressed into a kinda blue button down robe, hair net and long white socks (super stylish) and my partner got a disposable full body cover and they gave me painkillers (2 paracetamol, 1 ibuprofen) and a calming tablet. A nurse took my blood pressure and inserted an IV connection into my arm (a bit of sharp pain but not bad, same as giving blood really). Then we just waited I think for about an hour.

The actual procedure was in a private room, typical gynecology set up with semi reclined bed and leg stirrups, they gave me extra blanket and pillows for my head and arms so it was pretty cosy. They make you go to pee before as they like to work with an empty bladder (my procedure took longer than expected so part way through they used a catheter to get more out because it had started accumulating again - I was kinda scared of this as I always expected catheters to be really painful, I once accidentally put a vaginal swab into my uretha and -wow, that HURT- so when they said they would do a catheter I was really bracing for the pain, but there was nothing, phew). They started with a normal vaginal ultrasound just as a general check, no gel so it felt a bit odd/kinda pulled a bit but ok.  They gave me extra intravenous pain killer shots into the IV (these were quick acting but also faded fast so there was a nurse on hand to to top up as and when I needed it), I also had numbing shots in the vaginal wall where they put the collection needle through. Overall, the pain was not too bad, I've had much worse with mittelschmerz and also the HSG/saline ultrasound was much more unpleasant. There was one point where it really hurt around my butthole, even though the needle obviously wasn't anywhere near there and the nurse explained that they had probably touched a nerve. 

The estimated procedure time is 10-15 minutes, for me it took around 30 because my ovaries apparently kept moving about (! I never knew they could do that). I could watch what they were doing on the ultrasound screen and it was weirdly satisfying watching the follicles disappear. You don't see the whole needle just the tip floating around so it's not scary to look at. Afterwards, we went back to the room with the beds and I lay down with a warm blanket and pillow, very cosy. After a little bit they came and gave us both a cup of coffee and a sandwich. We waited a bit longer, had a few talks about the next steps and then headed home. They made me pee again before I left (I think just to check that I could go ok, it wasn't easy as I think my bladder was basically empty), I bled a bit during this, kinda like a medium heavy period bleed but other than a tiny bit of spotting there hasn't been any blood. They give you a sanitary towel. 

Overall, the experience was fine - I wouldn't rush back (lol), but it was much better than expected. One great thing was the staff, they were all super kind and supportive and made sure I was always comfortable and understood what was going on. When we have done the rest of the process, I'll make sure to write them a really nice review. 

For aftercare, they advised to take paracetamol if needed and I also got a prescription for a codein based pain killer if I needed anything stronger, I haven't even needed to take parecetamol, I am very mildly achy but it's fine.

I'm happy to answer questions if anyone has any and I will write an update about the implantation procedure as well (will be in ca 2 months as they got enough eggs to make frozen embryos with and said I should do one normal cycle and then implantation on the following cycle). We shall know how many embryos we have next Wednesday!

Had the Sage Precision brewer for 4 years, my partner dropped the carafe last night and the lid shattered.. yes, a replacement lid is probably all that is needed but I want a new part, and Sage only offer a Carafe unit which is £84!

So, me being me. I start instantly looking at ""replacement units"" I have read about Moccamaster, but in two minds. After coming across James Hoffman YT video.

You see, we have an EV so we benefit from cheap electric at night, so our coffee comes on about 4:30am, and it's nice and hot for 6am when we wake up. We make a full carafe, about a 800mls of Coffee for me, and 800mls for my partner, goes down a treat, capacity is great.

I'm probably being cheap, but with the Moccamaster there is no timer (unless we buy a smart plug, perhaps problem solved?) But alot of the units I see have a hot plate, which I hear isn't great for the coffee. We buy freshly roasted filter from RAVE. So with out normal routine, I don't know if the glass carafe would hold out for an hour and a half, -  2 hours on weekends and it still being hot.

Now, we could just.. not benefit from cheap coffee, brew it and turn the smart plug off and have it made about 15 minutes before we wake up. Problem solved.. but is it?

We love the Sage, but it has had a repair once before, due to the screen failing under warranty, I want something a little bit more robust.. something that can last a long time than just a few years. We also don't use any of the features other than Gold + timer...

For background, my boyfriend and I were childhood classmates. Back then, I had a horrible math teacher who often picked on me, and I struggled with even basic math. My now-boyfriend used to laugh along when the teacher embarrassed me, though I had a huge crush on him.

I eventually took it as a challenge and worked hard to overcome my difficulties. Today, I have a bachelor's and a master’s degree in math. Two years ago, I moved to Germany and needed accommodation. Through a WhatsApp group, I found a shared apartment with two Indian girls, M and D, and a guy—who turned out to be my former classmate. He didn’t recognize me at first, but we eventually talked, and he apologized for how he treated me back then.

In our second year of the master’s program, he asked me out, and I said yes. D wasn’t happy about it. We worked the same part-time job, and she told people there that I ""stole her boyfriend."" People treated me poorly for weeks. When I confronted her, she claimed she was just joking and meant I “stole him as a friend.”

Later, she got drunk, confessed her love for him, and called me slurs. The next morning, she said it was another joke. We distanced ourselves from her, but she begged my boyfriend to reconcile. I stayed polite but kept my distance.

After finals, I got an internship in another city, which could lead to a full-time job. I also needed to move out because of D’s bullying—adding salt to my food, spilling coffee on my bed, etc. My boyfriend originally suggested we move to that city together. While applying for the internship, he agreed to look for jobs there. But after I got it, he seemed off. When I asked if he’d made progress, he snapped and called me clingy and obsessive—as if I followed him to Germany just to date him (though he asked *me* out).

During this fight, D showed up and said she and my boyfriend had secretly applied to jobs in a different city, two hours away. He didn’t tell me because he thought I’d be “possessive.” Later, he apologized but still justified moving in with D and M instead of me because D was feeling distant and he’d promised to “take care of them.”

I asked where I stood in his future plans. He said he still loved me but asked me to understand D’s feelings. That was my breaking point. I quietly packed and left to stay with a friend. He didn’t text me all week. After I moved out, he sent me a long message calling me ungrateful and crazy. His friends also messaged me, calling me a loser for “fumbling” him despite knowing what D did.

I still love him, but I feel deeply disrespected and unvalued. I tried to communicate but wasn’t heard. I think I deserve better than someone who can’t set boundaries. So AITA?",1,1744313589.0,ToxicRelationships,2,1.0,False

1jw6hj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jw6hj5/husbands_birthday/,Husbands birthday,"Hi everyone. So I need some help deciding what to do here, and would like some input, if possible. 

My husband’s birthday is coming up in May and I had a couple ideas that I wanted to bounce off of you guys and see if they’re good ones. I wanna get an early jump on it just in case I need to be sneaky and order things ahead of time. I also want to know if I might be going “too far”- because he generally doesn’t like his birthday (his parents were really cruel about it growing up). 

So I wake up every morning at 4AM to make my husband breakfast before he goes to work (construction), bacon, eggs, pancakes, French press coffee- whatever he’s feeling, but that’s the usual. I was thinking instead of that meal, getting up a little earlier, like 3:45ish, and making him French toast with Nutella and bananas? It’s one of his fav breakfast foods.

Next, while he’s gone (I’m a housewife so I have the house to myself) I was thinking about making him a cake. He loves my carrot cake, so I was thinking that one, but I’m not sure if that really screams “Birthday” so I’m open to suggestions. 

Then for dinner, I’m stuck between chicken parmigiana over spaghetti, or ribeyes with clam chowder. Also open to suggestions here, I can make just about anything. 

As for gifts, he’s super into golf, so I’ve been trying to pick his brain about it, but whenever I try to say “birthday present?”, he says “no that’s too expensive, I got it”. I’m ready to just drop the money and get him a Lab Putter, but he mentioned that he wants to get fitted first- so that’s in my way. Any ideas??

For background, my boyfriend and I were childhood classmates. Back then, I had a horrible math teacher who often picked on me, and I struggled with even basic math. My now-boyfriend used to laugh along when the teacher embarrassed me, though I had a huge crush on him.

I eventually took it as a challenge and worked hard to overcome my difficulties. Today, I have a bachelor's and a master’s degree in math. Two years ago, I moved to Germany and needed accommodation. Through a WhatsApp group, I found a shared apartment with two Indian girls, M and D, and a guy—who turned out to be my former classmate. He didn’t recognize me at first, but we eventually talked, and he apologized for how he treated me back then.

In our second year of the master’s program, he asked me out, and I said yes. D wasn’t happy about it. We worked the same part-time job, and she told people there that I ""stole her boyfriend."" People treated me poorly for weeks. When I confronted her, she claimed she was just joking and meant I “stole him as a friend.”

Later, she got drunk, confessed her love for him, and called me slurs. The next morning, she said it was another joke. We distanced ourselves from her, but she begged my boyfriend to reconcile. I stayed polite but kept my distance.

After finals, I got an internship in another city, which could lead to a full-time job. I also needed to move out because of D’s bullying—adding salt to my food, spilling coffee on my bed, etc. My boyfriend originally suggested we move to that city together. While applying for the internship, he agreed to look for jobs there. But after I got it, he seemed off. When I asked if he’d made progress, he snapped and called me clingy and obsessive—as if I followed him to Germany just to date him (though he asked *me* out).

During this fight, D showed up and said she and my boyfriend had secretly applied to jobs in a different city, two hours away. He didn’t tell me because he thought I’d be “possessive.” Later, he apologized but still justified moving in with D and M instead of me because D was feeling distant and he’d promised to “take care of them.”

I asked where I stood in his future plans. He said he still loved me but asked me to understand D’s feelings. That was my breaking point. I quietly packed and left to stay with a friend. He didn’t text me all week. After I moved out, he sent me a long message calling me ungrateful and crazy. His friends also messaged me, calling me a loser for “fumbling” him despite knowing what D did.

I still love him, but I feel deeply disrespected and unvalued. I tried to communicate but wasn’t heard. I think I deserve better than someone who can’t set boundaries. So AITA?",6,1744313224.0,AmItheAsshole,15,1.0,False

1jw6evf,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1jw6evf/dhs_family_fraternizes_with_bm_and_her_family/,DH's family fraternizes with BM and her family,"Please be kind and not just harp on my DH as I'm trying to look for the best way to discuss this with him.

DH and I have been together for almost 4 years, married fairly recently.

I honestly don’t know if it’s a cultural difference but DH seems to think it’s normal that his family have a relationship with her because “she’s my son’s mom”. BM and DH were never married, so she's purely just SS' mom. I don't see why she and her family should still have access to his family.

* MIL has BM pinned on her messages and they text/chat constantly.
* Last year on Father’s Day, BM, SS, and BM’s mom went over to my FIL’s house to have coffee with him.
* BM’s mom, SS, and my MIL recently went on a trip to visit my DH’s grandparents. I already think it’s weird to be having coffee together, but this was a 3 day trip. Why BM’s mom needed to be there? I have no idea. I didn't know BM's mom went on the trip until after they got back.
* BM took SS and MIL on a week long trip to visit BIL in another state and stayed at his place. I was already uncomfortable with BM and SS going to visit BIL, but didn't find out MIL was going until they were actually on a plane going there.
* BM easily calls FIL for things she needs help with like a flat tire or rides to the airport.

These are just a few examples of ways that they fraternize. I usually don't find out until after the fact.

She has no paternal figure in her life right now and is still single and hasn't made any attempts to date after separating from my DH. It makes me wonder if they'll still behave this way if she does end up getting a new partner.

In my culture, once a couple splits up, the boundaries are VERY clear even if none of the parents are in a new relationship yet. Add in a new partner on either side and there’s no way in HELL they’d fraternize like this. It's simply unheard of.

The level of enmeshment really bothers me but they all seem to think it’s normal. It honestly makes me feel like I’m crazy for thinking this isn’t normal. It feels so disrespectful to me as his WIFE. However, even if DH does end up agreeing with me, his family clearly doesn't or else they wouldn't keep behaving this way.

I don't know if it's petty, but it makes me not want to be close to his family at all. It's already a sensitive subject for me because I've always dreamt of having a great and close relationship with my in laws, but we already have a language barrier. My MIL and FIL have been in the states for 30+ years and refuse to learn English. I've put in the effort to learn their heritage language and am barely conversational. I'm jealous and insecure (of BM) because BM, DH, and DH's family share the same heritage language which automatically puts her closer to them than me. Not only do they not try to learn English to connect with me, they fraternize with BM and her family to add insult to injury. I feel like it's extremely disrespectful but I feel so alone because my family lives in a different state.

So this morning, I’m just trying to live my little corporate girl working life & decided to make a quick pitstop for coffee before heading into the office. Innocent stuff. I hop off the highway on an exit ramp, speed up a tiny bit because I’m running late and Starbucks is calling my name. A guy in a black Cadillac signals to merge over in front of me, so I slow down like a functioning member of society to let him in.

Big mistake.

This man, this mystery raging man in a Cadillac, gets in front of me and immediately starts slamming on his brakes like he’s trying to morse code on me via tail lights. I honked a couple times (as one does when someone is trying to vehicularly manslaughter you at 25 mph), but then I realized….oh no. Oh no no no. This man is… unwell.

We eventually get to a red light and he pulls up next to me. Rolls his window down. His middle fingers flying up in the air like a dancing inflatable tube man. And this is where it turns into a scene from the movie Unhinged. He leans out and starts screaming, at full chest, full lung capacity: F*** YOUUUUU! F*** YOUUUUU!” like he was auditioning for the damn opera. Over and over again.

My body shut down. Breathing? No. Hands? Shaking like maracas. I decided to turn right and yeeted myself off that route completely. Coffee be damned.

I’m still rattled. I’ve never had an encounter like this in all 23 years of my very mild existence. I keep replaying the whole thing in my head, trying to figure out what I did to summon the Cadillac driving demon.

Anyway. I said a quick prayer for both my safety and his deeply unstable mental state. But seriously, road rage people are terrifying. Stay safe out there. And maybe skip the exit ramp coffee detour

1jw6ah6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingGeek/comments/1jw6ah6/8_prep_steps_for_better_local_business_client/,8 Prep Steps for Better Local Business Client Meetings,"If you’ve ever worked with local businesses, you probably already know that client meetings can be make-or-break moments. The way you prepare for them can really determine whether you build trust with the client or leave the meeting feeling uncertain. Over time, I’ve realized that good preparation is essential for ensuring a productive and effective meeting. Here are 8 steps I always take to make sure I’m ready:

**1. Know Your Client’s Business Inside and Out**

Before I even step into the meeting, I make sure I know the client’s business as well as I know my own. I take the time to explore their website, check out their social media profiles, and read up on any reviews or mentions online. I also try to understand their target audience and what they’re currently doing in terms of marketing. I’ve found that the more I understand their business, the better I can craft strategies that are tailored to their needs. I always ask myself: What are their goals? What problems are they facing?

**2. Set Clear Objectives for the Meeting**

A lot of times, we go into meetings with a vague idea of what we want to accomplish, but I’ve learned that setting clear goals is crucial. Are you discussing a new marketing strategy? Are you reviewing past campaign performance? Knowing exactly what you want to achieve keeps the conversation on track and helps everyone stay focused on the bigger picture. I also make sure to communicate these objectives to the client ahead of time, so we’re both on the same page from the start.

**3. Prepare Relevant Case Studies or Examples**

Clients love seeing proof of success, so I always bring relevant case studies or examples to show them. For instance, when I was working with a local restaurant, I shared a case study of another restaurant I helped increase their reservations through improved local SEO. It’s so much easier to explain a concept when you have real-world results to back it up. It builds trust and shows the client that you know exactly what you're doing.

**4. Understand Their Local Market**

If you’re working with a local business, understanding their community and competitors is key. I remember working with a small coffee shop that struggled to stand out in a busy neighborhood. After doing some market research, I discovered that most of their competitors weren’t utilizing local SEO strategies effectively. This allowed me to create a targeted approach that really made an impact. The more you understand their local market, the more relevant and actionable your advice will be.

**5. Prepare Thoughtful Questions**

I’ve learned that asking the right questions is just as important as providing answers. It shows the client that I’m listening and genuinely interested in solving their problems. I always come prepared with questions like: What’s been your biggest challenge recently? or What’s one thing you’d like to improve about your business in the next few months? These questions spark conversation and give me more insight into what they truly need.

**6. Be Ready with Tech and Tools**

Nothing kills the flow of a meeting faster than technical issues. I’ve made the mistake of relying too much on tech during meetings in the past, and it’s not fun when things don’t work. Now, I always test my presentation ahead of time, make sure my laptop is charged, and bring a backup charger just in case. A smooth setup makes the whole meeting go a lot more smoothly, and it shows that you’re prepared and professional.

**7. Foster a Collaborative Atmosphere**

When I walk into a meeting, I try to remind myself that I’m not just there to “tell” the client what to do—I’m there to collaborate with them. I ask questions, listen carefully, and encourage them to share their thoughts. A collaborative approach builds trust and helps the client feel like they’re part of the process, not just being given instructions. For example, when working on a website redesign, I always ask for feedback at each stage to ensure the client’s vision is aligned with the work we’re doing.

**8. Follow Up with a Summary Email**

The meeting doesn’t end when you leave the room. I’ve found that sending a follow-up email is an excellent way to summarize everything discussed and outline the next steps. It helps both you and the client stay on the same page, and it also reinforces your commitment to delivering results. Plus, it gives the client a written reference to go back to later if they need to.

At the end of the day, client meetings are about more than just showing up. They’re about preparation, collaboration, and ensuring that everyone walks away with a clear understanding of what’s next. If you’ve worked with local businesses, I’d love to hear your thoughts—how do you prep for client meetings? Do you have any strategies that have worked well for you?

I plan on getting a floor lamp and maybe some side tables to put on either side of the loveseat sofa but I’m not sure whether to get a coffee table or not since, due to the dimensions, I feel like putting it close to one couch would leave it kind of far from the other or if I leave it in the middle of the living room, it would be too far from both.

I haven’t seen my mom physically in 10 years and even when she was around I was very neglected by her as a child. me and her don’t talk much because she doesn’t make a effort to get to know me but today she asked me for $40 straight up, dropped the email for e transfer and didn’t give a reason why she needs that money. I have not seen this woman for years, she is under house arrest and she can’t even show up to a coffee date with me. She does not have that relationship with me to be asking for money that comfortably. I live with my dad and step mom but before it was just me and my dad. 

I told her straight no and now she’s pestering me, getting angry. I’m not having it. I don’t have an emotional connection with her and she doesn’t care for that, she only sees money in me. she doesn’t know what i look like (we only communicate thru text) and what i even am as a person. Is it wrong to not let someone feel so comfortable to ask for money when our relationship is the equivalent to a stranger? I might just cut her off. ",4,1744312473.0,family,6,1.0,False

**Chapter 13**

I wake up to darkness.

It takes me a few seconds to hear Rose’s breathing, and Dee’s high pitched snores. I stare into the darkness, until a blue notification in the corner of my vision asks for my attention.

I’d been ignoring it after the fight with Doss and his men, but now that I’ve had some sleep, I feel more ready to kick the system’s ass.

**Congratulations! You have reached level 3! You gain a two percentage point increase to brilliance and physicality along with an increase of 20 points to the special attribute Psi.**

 

***General Info:*** **Elena S. Trudeau**

**Class: N/A** 

**Mana: N/A**

What happens when brilliance reaches 100%? Something good, probably.

*Or terrible.*

That seems highly unlikely.

**None.** 

**And all items in his inventory:** 

**$2,000 American Dollars, Two Apples, Small Knife, Throwing Knives (Unique), Set Of Keys, Deck Of Playing Cards, Set Of Dice.**

 

Eeeew. Don’t call me that, like ever. We ain’t like that, System.

I eventually manage to turn my glare away from the parentheses, only for my gaze to be caught on the first thing listed in his inventory. I’ve never had that much money.

And it’s all mine.

My own.

*My precious.*

No no no. Shut up.

Just cause I have some sweet monies does *not* mean that I’m going full gollum.

The shifting of sheets next to me reminds me that I’m not alone. Rose hadn’t wanted to be left alone, so she’d stayed up here with me and we’d thrown a small pajama party.

I’d lent her my panda-bear jammies, and I’d worn my old bunny onesie.

“Are you here?” Rose asks, half asleep.

I put my hand on her cheek and she snuggles into it. “I’m here.” I glance at the clock. “We should get up, we have class in an hour.”

Rose seems to fully wake up at that. She pulls away from my hand to look at me from the little light coming through the window. “Elena? Last night wasn’t a dream?”

“Afraid not.”

She pauses, then shoves herself up, causing Dee to fall to the ground with a muffled “Eep!”

“Elena, did you say we only have an hour?” She asks.

“Yep.” I stretch, and leave the bed, the floppy ears of my onesie bouncing in front of my face. “You should call your dad.”

Rose is out of the bed in a second as she hurries to the door. She flips on the light, then opens the door. “What are you waiting for?”

I giggle as I open my dresser. “I thought you might want to change first.”

She looks down at the panda-bear jammies she’s wearing. She blinks several times, then gives me a silly smile as she closes the door.

“My clothes should fit you.” I say, throwing a pair of jeans and a purple shirt her way.

She catches them easily, and looks at them with a tilted head. “I didn’t know you had nice clothes.”

“Hey! Just cause I don’t put effort in doesn’t mean- you know what. Shut up. My phone is on the nightstand. Call your dad.” I look back to my dresser and pull out some more clothes.

She’s quiet for a long moment. I turn around to see her looking at the torn and bloody clothes sitting in a pile in the corner.

“What?” I ask, drawing her attention back to me.

“Are you okay? That’s a lot of blood.”

I look back at the clothes, dyed brown from blood. “Yeah, most of it isn’t mine.” I take off my onesie, stripping down to my underthings.

Rose looks away, her cheeks reddening.

“I’ll shower while you call.” I say, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around myself as I walk past her.

“Mhm.” Is her only response.

I’m surprisingly quick with my shower, and Rose rushes past me to take my place when I’m done.

I sit down at my dresser and start combing my hair, humming lightly.

Dee floats over to me, and sits down on the mouse of my computer. “You two are cute.” She places her head in her hands and sighs. “I wish I had a relationship like that.”

“It’s a little early to be calling it a relationship.” I say.

Dee perks up, ignoring my comment. “Hey, are there any cute male Faeries around here?”

“Not that I know of.” I respond. I stand up to place some books in my backpack. “I hear there are elves in Iceland though.”

“Elves? Why would I date one of them.” She sticks her tongue out at me. “Maybe I could convince you to buy another Faerie guard… I want him to be handsome, oh oh, he should control the water element.” She flies over to my ear and continues in a hushed tone. “Water and lightning, it’s an *electrifying* combo.”

I smile and wink at the little Faerie as I finish packing my bag.

 

\*\*\*

 

“You think so?” I ask, opening my bedroom door for her.

“Mhm. He definitely likes him. Plus they’re the perfect ship-” Rose stops as voices reach us from downstairs.

She frowns, then rushes down the stairs. I follow a few steps behind.

As we come into the kitchen, we find a handsome man with black hair and blue eyes animatedly talking to my father about local politics. They break off conversation as we enter the room.

My father takes a bite of toast, and smiles as he catches sight of the two of us. “Hey honey. I didn’t realize you had a friend over. Rose’s father,” He motions in the direction of the strange man, “came by to pick her up.” He smiles at me and Rose, clueless to the mob boss he has in his house.

“Rose! I hurried over here as soon as I could. Give your dad a hug?” The man opens his arms.

“What are you doing here? I told you I was fine, like you even care.” Oof. Brutal.

The man flinches, “Sorry darling. I came to get you. I’ve decided it’s time we move somewhere safer-”

“No.”

“What do you mean no?” Mr. Demor’s smile disappears, and he looks at his daughter with genuine worry. “Two times. That’s too many.”

“I’ve just started to make friends here. I’m not moving again.” Rose’s lip quivers, but she hides it as she crosses her arm.

“It’s only been three days…” Mr. Demor glances at me, then shakes his head. “Come on, we’re leaving.”

She looks at him, her mouth open as tears gather in her eyes. She looks at me, pleading for help.

I smile.

“Dad, could you give us a second?” I ask sweetly.

“Are you sure honey?” He asks.

I nod, and the man grabs his cup of coffee. “I’ll be in the other room, call me if you need me.”

I wait for him to leave, then turn to Mr. Demor.

“Actually, sir. Our connection is *very* important.” I step in front of her. “She’s under my protection, and if you try to take her from me, I will take your ‘company’ apart block by block, until you are living with nothing more than rags on the street.”

The man steps forward, his face hardening. “Do you have any idea-”

I step forward, not backing down from the man. “I’ve saved her life twice. If you want to know how, you can go to hell and ask Doss. I’m sure he’ll be happy to answer.”

“Dad.” We both turn to Rose. “I’m happy here. And- and I really like her.”

Mr. Demor looks between the two of us, and a dawning look of realization passes over him. “Oh. Hmm.” He reaches out and pulls me to the side away from her. His eyes hold mine as he speaks in a whisper. “You know what happens if you break my daughter’s heart? I hope I don’t have to actually make threats.”

“We’re not at that stage yet, but yes. I understand.”

He holds my eyes for a long moment, then pulls away. “Good.”

“On that note, can you give us a ride to school? We’re running late.” I smile.

“Meet me outside.” He says, turning and heading to the front room. *“Three days and already in love. What’s a dad supposed to do…”* He mutters as he leaves.

Hey, look, I’ve been avoiding the L word, alright? It’s still early, and I don’t want to move too fast.

Rose looks at me with a smile that she quickly tries to hide. “Under your protection, huh? When did that happen?”

“You needed help, plus, I do really like you.”

“Like me, huh? Well, I like you too.”

I pause, those words ringing through my head in a way I hadn’t expected them to. I look at Rose. She bites her lip, then giggles as she turns around and heads for the door.

I follow, and find my dad whistling innocently in the living room as he reads a newspaper. My eyes narrow at him.

Sweat beads on his forehead, as he turns the page.

“The newspaper is upside down.” I tell him.

“Ah. Funny that.” He says, turning the page rightside up.

“Were you listening?” I ask.

He gives me his most charming smile from behind the paper, “Maybe a little?”

I snort.

“I’m proud of you. Standing up for her like that.”

I blink, surprised by the seriousness of his voice.

“And I’m happy for you. She seems like a nice girl, and her father seems like an upstanding man.”

I chuckle, “You have no idea.” I walk over to him, and pull the newspaper down to give him a kiss on his forehead. “Please be nice and let me be the one to tell mom.”

He gives me a devilish smile, “Are you kidding? I haven’t had info this juicy since you turned Blake down at the dance.” He jumps out of the chair and walks towards the kitchen. He continues in a sing-song voice, “How in the world could I keep this from your mother?”

I pick up a magazine and throw it at the goofball.

He catches the magazine. “Are you going to make that poor girl and her father wait all day? You are late for school, you know.”

I shake my head, and walk towards the door. “I love you dad.”

“Love you too Sunshine.”

I head outside to find a black sedan waiting for us, a man in a suit and shades holding the back door open for me.

I step inside, where Rose waits for me with a smile.",2,1744312073.0,HFY,2,0.67,False

1jw5xe9,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1jw5xe9/7_hours_sterilized/,7 hours sterilized!,"Hi all! I’m about 7ish hours post-op and wanted to share my experience! My experience may look a bit different than others but some may find it helpful. To start off I am 24F and have a fun mix of Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and POTS so that complicated the pre procedure experience. It was super easy to get approved by my gyno who was also my surgeon she just wanted me to be aware of risks of any surgery and made sure I don’t want children (a resounding and immediate yes lol). I live in a red state so I was concerned about having to fight for sterilization being unmarried and young but it was no problem. It took a little while to be medically cleared as I had to have a cardiologist confirm my POTS diagnosis and clear me to be put under anesthesia, so I had to reschedule my first procedure appointment (until today!). It was annoying and heartbreaking as I was so excited to get it done, but it all worked out in the end. After getting cleared for anesthesia the next week was a blur of me getting myself prepped, I have OCD and health anxiety so I kind of leaned into it in terms of sterilizing my room and getting it set up to move around easily (all my cords in an easy to reach place, plenty of my favorite snacks, and a basket of my medicines, as well as (ironically) a pregnancy pillow to both help my regular joint pain and help me sit up comfortably and keep me from rolling around as I sleep). So far my prep has made my first few hours of recovery very comfortable and I’m very lucky and grateful to have an incredible partner who has been instrumental in taking care of me. 

On to the surgery day. We arrived at the surgical center at about 6:30am for my scheduled 7:30 appointment. Check in was super easy and I was taken back pretty quickly where they confirmed my medication list and last taken doses. They had me put my personal items in bags and took my cane to the recovery room. I changed into a gown and my favorite new socks and I had to give the dreaded urine sample (that obviously came back clean and fetus free). I was given a warm blanket and wraps for my legs to prevent clots and was hooked up to my iv with a saline drip, I was given two medications for nausea (with a little bit of water (hooray because i was so thirsty!). My anesthesiologist came in to talk to me about going under (it was my first time so i was nervous) and my surgeon came in to talk about the procedure and I asked if I could keep my tubes after pathology (she said it might be a lot of paperwork so we will see). I was given something for anxiety and was wheeled back to the OR and the last thing I remember is getting up onto the table and then I magically woke up in the recovery bay very sleep and a little thirsty (it was the best nap I’ve ever had). After recovering for a bit and getting vitals checked and my iv removed I was discharged and on my way home (with a squish mellow to protect my tummy from the seatbelt). We stopped for a coffee and gelato as a little treat and went home to crawl into bed where I took a fabulous percocet (given at the center) fueled nap. My partner just picked up my percocet script from the pharmacy and I’m about to have a snack and get chinese takeout for dinner! My pain is pretty minimal (probably due to the pain meds) but I know I have a high pain tolerance so everyone’s experience may be different. Definitely feels like some pretty consistent cramps mixed with an ab workout and my gas pain is nearly gone thanks to a heating pad. 

This has all been such a relief and I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. This was a decision made for my life and my health and I couldn’t be happier about it, it’s truly freeing, I’m so happy to be sterile and feral ☺️ thank you all for sharing your experiences on here it has been such a help to me in walking this path knowing others treaded it before me and knowing what to expect, I’m so happy I get to share my experience as well and hopefully help someone else on their journey ❤️",11,1744311957.0,sterilization,4,1.0,False

1jw5v9i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jw5v9i,Upcoming 8-Day Trip in Faroe Islands,"Hi All, First time poster. I'm headed to the Faroe Islands in ten days and looking for advice on reducing my packing load. 8-day trip including travel. My plane ticket is Economy Lite which comes with a carry-on restriction of 6kg/13lbs. I'm up for the challenge but need some advice. This is the first time I'm going this extreme but have been a dedicated one-bagger/carry-on only for years. Temperatures seems to be hovering in the 40s F/5-9 C.

I'm looking for general feedback especially from folks who have been to the Faroe Islands or somewhere similar, in addition to questions/comments regarding what I could do without/change, if I'm missing anything, and thoughts on these specific dilemmas:

1. Shoes - I'm aware that trying to bring a second pair of shoes and house slippers is a luxury and possibly foolhardy. I was originally only planning on wearing hiking boots, but I think my feet will get tired and need a break over 8 days. So I am willing to potentially sacrifice something else to bring these.

2. Tops & Outerwear - I think I could probably eliminate further, maybe I don't need the vest if I have the jacket or I can get rid of one of the tops.

3. Toiletries - I've minimized about as much as I'm comfortable but open where else I could cut.

4. Tech & Gear - I'm debating bringing a separate camera other than my phone and possibly a compact pair of binoculars but not sure I can fit them given the weight restriction. I have the space in the bag and am prepared to wear more clothes/put small things in my pockets to cut weight.

4. Miscellaneous - These are items that make my travel more comfortable, even when one bagging, but is probably the best area to look to make cuts.

I don't really know how to photograph this but tried to show everything all together, even stacked on top and everything packed up in the bag except for what I plan to wear on the flight. Thank you!

1jw5uco,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1jw5uco/first_time_flying_to_hk_tips_requested/,"First time flying to HK, tips requested","Haven't booked a thing, but the plan is to meet up with a friend (who has been there). I'll be flying out of Busan (PUS), since HK Express flies directly. Right now, I'm planning around 29 or 30 April through 3 May, seeing some cheap options through HK Express. Some questions that I'd appreciate help with:

1. I;ve read HK Express is a typical discount airline. Anyone try their U-First upgrade? I don't mind paying a bit for the exit row, and I'll be traveling super light, so what's the U-First get me?
2. Is onboard food worthwhile? I'm well used to 14-15 hr flights from the US <> Korea, I'm sure I can sneak some trail mix and coffee, but also, I wouldn't mind ordering something ahead of time.
3. HK specific now: Is this a bad time to travel? I know this is Golden Week in Japan, and I see some price spikes for the period (there's Labor Day celebrations seem to be in early May).
4. Am I okay w/o Alipay or anything HK/China specific? Do I need much cash? Pretend I'm a basic American tourist w/US-based banking, CCs, apps, etc. (I'm actually more worried about my day trip to Shanghai than HK...).
5. Best (local!) places to eat! Esp. near Admiralty Station. Pretend my friends and I are a pair of Asian foodie snobs (which is to say foodie snobs who are Asian, not snobby about Asian food)
6. Also any good hiking around there? Nothing too technical, but good scenery and preferably air quality.
7. Any other tips would be greatly appreciated!

Sorry, that's a lot, and starts fairly specifically about HK Express, but I've paused in the middle of booking my flight and hotel and figured I should ask reddit about it first. Thank you for your help!",0,1744311749.0,HongKong,3,0.33,False

1jw5ss5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1jw5ss5/do_you_know_what_is_cashu/,Do you know what is Cashu?,"Cashu is an open-source ""ecash"" (electronic cash) protocol built on top of Bitcoin. It was designed to bring more privacy, speed, and anonymity to Bitcoin transactions, functioning as a kind of ""digital cash"" that mimics the properties of physical money. The idea is based on the ""ecash"" concept created by David Chaum in the 1980s, but adapted to the Bitcoin ecosystem.

# How does it work?

Cashu operates with two main components:

1. **Mint**: An entity (which can be anyone or any organization) that issues digital tokens called ""ecash."" These tokens are backed by Bitcoin deposited into the mint via the Lightning Network (a second-layer solution for fast and cheap Bitcoin transactions).
2. **Wallet**: Users store these tokens in their own digital wallets, as if they were banknotes in their pocket.

When you deposit Bitcoin into a mint, it gives you ecash tokens in return. These tokens can be used to make instant, private transactions between users or services without leaving traces on the Bitcoin blockchain. Later, you can redeem those tokens for Bitcoin if you wish.

# What makes it special?

* **Privacy**: Cashu uses a technique called ""blind signatures,"" which prevents the mint from knowing who is spending the tokens or where they’re going. It’s like using physical cash: no one knows whose bill it is or how you spent it.
* **Speed**: Ecash transactions are instant and nearly cost-free because they happen off the main Bitcoin blockchain, typically via the Lightning Network.
* **Flexibility**: Anyone can set up a mint and issue tokens, making the system decentralized and accessible.

# Practical example

Imagine you want to buy a coffee from a friend who accepts Cashu. You deposit 1,000 satoshis (the smallest unit of Bitcoin) into a mint and receive a 1,000-sat ecash token. You send that token to your friend anonymously, and they can either use it or redeem it for Bitcoin back at the mint. The mint doesn’t know who you are or who you sent the token to.

# Limitations

* **Custody**: The mint is a point of trust. You need to trust that it will honor the tokens and not run off with the deposited Bitcoin.
* **Not a Bitcoin replacement**: Cashu isn’t an alternative to Bitcoin itself but a tool to enhance privacy in custodial systems.

In summary, Cashu Bitcoin is an extra layer in the Bitcoin ecosystem that enables fast, private, and anonymous transactions, like digital pocket money, but it still relies on trust in the mint operator. It’s ideal for micropayments, anonymous donations, or situations where you want more privacy than Bitcoin alone provides.",0,1744311649.0,Bitcoin,10,0.5,False

1jw5rjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jw5rjg/i_blame_myself_for_someone_committing_suicide/,I blame myself for someone committing suicide,"Tw: (suicide) (cheating)
CONTEXT:
He was my work mate and a day before Christmas we had a drink with my co-workers as an early celebration. We got drunk and made out and slept together, I, knowing that he had a girlfriend at the time. It was supposed to be a one night stand but he seems to be wanting more after that. He created a dump account to reach out to me and seems to be wanting connection. I tried to tell him that he had a girlfriend at the time but there’s this urge in me to want to be connected to him as well. He was a good man to be honest, a responsible co-worker, a helpful person and a man with a lot of dreams not only for him but for other people as well. That’s why maybe I gave in and kept entertaining him. We kept talking to each other and going out for hidden coffee dates. Getting to know each other and maybe I got attached to him because of that. But we made it clear that we’re just supposed to be friends with benefits because he doesn’t want to have any romantic commitment yet. We were planning on moving in together but no strings attached, which I’m kinda having already.

Well to make myself clear, two weeks after our supposed to be one night stand, he told me that he and her girlfriend at the time already broke up. I believed him even though his ""ex-girlfriend"" still goes to the place where we work. He keeps on telling me that the girl just keeps going at our workplace to beg him to come back to her and make things work. Which I really did believed in. That’s why I chose to continue what we’re having because of the thought that maybe we could make it work and that he doesn’t have anyone anymore.

Anyways, to cut the story short, one night I got a message from his ex-girlfriend saying that she found out about us through checking his phone. She has read everything we talked about on the dump account that he created, even the explicit conversations. She threatened me and the guy that she would destroy our lives and made it known to everyone what we did. Only for me to find out that even though they broke up already, they’re still seeing each other while me and the guy is also doing so. They are also still sleeping with each other while me and the guy is also doing so, even if they already broke up. I didn’t know that they were still doing couple things while we have a thing and while they already broken up. But I don’t have the right to be mad, because I was the one who did that first with him. It’s like getting cheated on as well but in my case, I don’t have the right to be mad because we’re just fwb.

After knowing that his ""ex-girlfriend"" found out about us, he panicked and had suicidal thoughts. He had a background on hurting himself before but I didn’t thought that he would get to a point that he would really commit. He told me that he would try to patch things up and that he’s sorry for making things worse for me. I fully knew that he was gonna commit but I can’t do anything about it. I tried to beg him to not do it but he’s saying that I should let him go and him committing suicide would help me from the matter. It’s like his only solution at the time to stop his ex-girlfriend for ruining both our images and reputation. I know where he was but not the exact location so I couldn’t go to stop him. I wanted to save him but I couldn’t at the time because I was panicking as well. He took his own life to sacrifice himself so that his ex-girlfriend would stop threatening everyone who knows about it. He said that’s the only way to make her stop because she’s really upset that time. He died last February and up until now I blame myself for everything. I blame myself that I haven’t saved him even though I could’ve. I blame myself for not saying where he is. I blame myself for him getting to meet me, because if only we didn’t happen then none of this would’ve happened. Then maybe he would still be alive and getting to achieve his goals and dreams. I would forever be guilty of what happened.

It’s completely okay if you guys would also blame me because I blame myself as well. I just want to vent here and try to see different perspectives from this situation. I would appreciate your honesty.

1jw5qpa,https://i.redd.it/8zd8vn2n12ue1.jpeg,Bharara Buying Guide,"After been using King since past 2 years and Onyx as my go-to for the past 8 months among the others, saw this entire wall of Bharara scents at a store and after smelling them all, I'd like to share what inspirations/clones are each of these ""underrated brand"" imo as these are the top 2 frags I've got most compliments on owning around 40 colognes with mix of niche, designer and clones. Fyi, these are only from the men's section.
Idk how many of you know this brand but out of people I know none have even heard about them, best thing I love is the performance, it's eternal!
I'll start from top left to bottom right, below are my personal opinions about each one of them.

R1.1 Viking Kashmir Parfum - Le Labo Santal 33, I don't like it much Santal is bit smoother, they made this more masculine and honesty not a fan of either. 6/10
R1.2 Viking Beruit Parfum - ADG Profumo & Platinum Egoiste combo, stupid good earthy citrus combo for summer, with amped up citrus instead of smokiness yet way better than ADG Parfum, great performance too. 8.5/10
R1.3 Viking Dubai Parfum - Couldnt identify, earthy, green freshie with a woodsy-cedar/sandalwood base, nice enough but bit strong for me personally. 7/10
R1.4 Viking Cairo Parfum - LV L'immensite, superb freshie close enough to limmensite yet smooth versatile compliment getting long lasting fragrance. 8.5/10
R1.5 Viking Rio Parfum - B.9 Tribeca, sweet freshie smells niche and unisex, nice mass appealing scent with good longevity. 7.5/10
R2.1 Chocolate Edp - Kamrah Qawah, amped up chocolate instead of coffee, a sweeter KQ, one of the best smoothly blended coffee scent, smells unisex great performance. 8.5/10
R2.2 Boujee Edp - Xerjoff Accento, photorealistic iris scent smells super niche and high quality, almost smell pure musk, chokes with more than 2 sprays. 8.5/10
R2.3 Onyx Edp - B.9 Lafayette St., super mass appealing, well blended smooth vanilla based sweet/spicy scent, one of my fav. 9.5/10
R2.4 King Parfum - Erba Pura, masculine version of EP, more musky, way less sweet, fruity niche scent, chokes with more than 2 sprays, this is a compliment monster. 9/10
R2.5 Double Blue Edp - Hybrid, their own version of Chrome and old DHC mixed with amped up white florals and heavy performance, nice freshie for summer, I mostly get lemon, neroli and some lavender, safe blind buy. 8.5/10
R2.6 Don Edp - Aventus, a more leathery less sweeter Aventus, almost like a cross between Aventus and Dior Fahrenheit, smoky, fresher less pineapply aventus, performance is okay. 7/10
R2.7 Bleu Edp - PDM Layton, smooth well blended layton with amped up apple and vanilla combo, nice compliments however I personally feel layton dna is overhyped so not a fan but smells good to others. 7.5/10
R3.1 King Edp - Erba Pura, similar to 2.4 i.e King Parfum just a bit sweeter, again something that will choke you out with more than 2 sprays. 9/10
R3.2 Peace Parfum - for the love of god please someone tell me what this smells like, I'm going crazy, fyi it's lipsticky niche expensive smelling I'm not able to categorize it. 7.5/10
R3.3 Ramesis 1 Parfum - Killian Apple Brandy on the Rocks, sweet, fruity, woodsy unique smelling apple fragrance, smells sweet and fresh ambery in a way, nice enough, personally too sweet for me. 8/10
R3.4 Ramesis 2 Parfum - Amouage Interlude Man, strong loud woodsy/smoky scent for winter, bit earthy however personally don't like interlude/super woodsy dna. 7/10
R3.5 Placid Parfum - Roja Elysium, fresh slightly sweet orange scent, grown up man freshie, will prefer this over BDC any day, blind buy easy pull off versatile summer scent. 8.5/10
R3.6 King Gold - Le Male Elixir, this is what happens when every brand wants to jump on the hyped clone train however they failed miserably, I mean other's may like it but to me it's nowhere close near LME, more like LMExEP, and if it's not ment to be why copy the bottle design? On its own it's decent enough. 7.5/10

I missed adding King Soleil above, a pure 10/10, it's an amazing combo of their failed inspired LME & Erba Pura dna with added Raspberry/Plum/Blueberry idk exactly note/smell, however this is enough to make all the difference, it smells soo good 😭 just can't get over the fact it released after cold weather passed and I need to wait for summer to pass to grab a bottle, bonus: has a light up bottle, anyways below are my top rankings from this brand:

1. King Soleil
2. Onyx
3. King Parfum
4. Boujee
5. Viking Beruit
6. Viking Cairo
7. Double Bleu
8. Placid

Again, these are my opinions on what they smell like to my nose, they may be inspired by completely different smells but just wanted to introduce all to this brand as I believe it deserves more love, can't wait to hear your opinions on them. Keep smelling good! ",4,1744311502.0,fragranceclones,4,1.0,False
1jw5po9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1jw5po9/from_beer_to_coffee_how_has_the_coding_culture_in/,From Beer to Coffee: How Has the Coding Culture in College Evolved?,"I’m feeling nostalgic today and wanted to ask about how the culture around coding and tech has changed over the years, especially in college.

Ten years ago, when I was 20 and in college, we had a sacred rule: crack open a “programming beer” before diving into any coding homework. And if it was an all-nighter before a morning deadline, well, let’s just say the beer count could climb as high as six. It was messy—bugs everywhere—but we laughed through it and somehow got the job done. It felt like a badge of honor.

Now, at 30, working in tech professionally, it’s all about coffee. Precise pours, stand-up meetings, and a more… adult approach. The industry has matured, and so have the habits. But I can’t help wondering: has this shift trickled down to the college scene too?

Then came COVID and remote study. I imagine that must have shaken things up even more. Did Zoom classes and isolated coding sessions kill the communal beer-coding vibe? Or did students find new ways to keep the spirit alive?

So, I’m turning to you, current college students or recent grads: what’s the vibe like now? Do you still have those late-night coding sessions with a beer (or six), or has it shifted to something else—maybe Red Bull, coffee, or just sheer willpower? How has the culture evolved in your experience?

I’d love to hear your stories and insights. Let’s reminisce and compare notes across generations! Thank you for your answers 👏

Im stressed, not thinking straight and I was using my partners car because mine was making a rattling noise. As I was leaving this place my mind was on one of the million things I need to do next. We are going out of town tommorow to celebrate my partners bday weekend and theres a lot to do. My mind is on that. Im not thinking, driving my partners car and what happens? I backed right into someones car. Of course she was in it and she was young and she was freaking out. She called her mom and I couldnt get in touch with my partner and could not find any info on my insurance in the car. I gave them my number and sent them the info right away but then I just burst into tears. I dont need this fucking stress right now.

For the past few years, I’ve been running my own business that’s a “matchmaking service”. It’s been going well! I mostly run it in NYC, as that’s where I’m originally from. I moved here a couple months ago to live with my long term partner. 

Anyway, one of my most popular services is something called Community Pod. What that is is, you fill out a survey about yourself- what you like to do, your politics, where you are in life, etc- and I use a pen and paper to manually make a matchmaking equation for compatibility amongst the participants. I match folks in groups of 6-8, based on who you vibe with most, who shares your views etc. This is mostly a platonic thing for folks to make friends. As most of you probably know, it’s HARD to make friends as an adult. I make it easier!!! I match you, I connect you, and I give you plans! In this, I always make sure the place you’re meeting up at is a small, locally owned bar or restaurant during slow hours so that I’m making sure that the businesses who deserve exposure get it, as well as support for the bartenders who might be having a slower day. 

Anyway, this post isn’t promotion, so I’m gonna stop here, and not say too much. 

This post is because I’m wondering where there are social media accounts, coffee shops who accept flyers, etc etc, that can maybe post for me? Or bars/cafes that are willing to collab with me and post for me?

I've been pranked only twice in my life and both times by the same friend (very thrilling life ik💀) first one was just her adding salt and lemon to my coffee. Nothing special or interesting although I should've seen it coming, since she so graciously offered to make me one *at my own house* which she had never done before😂 And also by the way she was giggling when she offered me the cup of coffee but I was too distracted gossiping with my other friends to even notice lol

Now the second one was a little more embarrassing: She had just gotten a new phone number and decided to impersonate a guy I really liked at the time. I was out shopping when the text came in, and I immediately bought into it replying all smiley and excited and flirty, strolling around the mall with this big silly smile on my face. We chatted for a bit then came the plot twist: ""I've always liked that friend of yours [her own name], think you could set me up with her?""

I got salty and replied: "" Well why don't you ask her out yourself?"" To which she said : ""And how exactly do I ask myself that?""
Me: ""...What?""
Then she sent me a selfie of herself 💀 I just stood there in the middle of the mall, face burning, definitely getting looks from strangers cause I can't even imagine what kind of expression I had 😂 She started flooding me with texts like ""I'm sorry I'm SO SORRY please don’t kill me."" But I let her fear marinate before I replied: "" Just make sure you’re not home when I get back. For your own sake. ""
I took my sweet time getting back home and when I did it was like a movie scene: I opened the door all slow and dramatic,  she was getting a snack from the kitchen and when she saw me she froze in her place . We locked eyes for a few seconds then she screamed and ran to the other room shutting the door behind her like it was a horror movie 💀 

So yeah I guess it was a bit cruel if you think about it but when I got past the *shock* I got over it pretty quick, especially after seeing her reaction, I felt like Micheal Meyers at that moment LMAO ",11,1744310829.0,CasualConversation,10,0.92,False

Hi guys, so I(30F) recently accepted my old classmate's(29M) request and he initiated the conversation and we talked. However, there are a couple of things which I noticed right off the bat:

1. He kept telling me to stay online which I couldn't because I have better things to do and I'm preparing for a very important exam
2. He then kept telling me to trust him and that he's this great friend of mine and someone who I should give a chance. I don't know this guy since the last 20 years and yes we did go to school together but I'm pretty reserved.
3. He then kept insisting on knowing everything about me and things which I didn't want to share with someone who is next to a stranger.
4. He then told me to not tell my husband about us because it's not really that serious and that's weird because there's nothing to hide (I did tell my husband since he's my best friend and we share everything)
5. Now, he keeps insisting on talking over the phone which I'm not really comfortable yet, meeting for a coffee or him spending his money taking me shopping. Which again is weird and quite uncomfortable because I can't fathom anyway willing to do all this .

Mind you, this guy married his highscool sweetheart after dating her for last 14 years and married to her for last 6 years. They have a little daughter (4M). I keep asking him if his wife is okay with all this what he says and that I would not disrespect her or my husband but he insists it's just a friendly meet.

He also keeps telling me how I should trust him and it's not a big deal but somehow I'm creeped out with his relentless messages or his excitement to talk over a phone call and to meet. Maybe I'm overreacting, so I just wanted an advice to know if I'm being paranoid or is he really pushing my boundaries and being mildly inappropriate?

On Sunday night (4/6/25), I let a friend spend the night at my house. The next day, I discovered that my credit card was missing. I assumed I had just lost the card somehow. When I checked my account online, I found several charges that I had not made—nail salon, Dutch bros coffee, Walmart, gas station, Airbnb. I called the nail salon and they described a woman that resembled my “friend”. I quickly canceled the card.

That same day, 4/7/25, I filed a police report and told them who I suspect stole the card. I also spoke with the woman’s parents and they confirmed that she had stolen from them and others. They also said she has abandoned her 3 year old child with them. 

April 8, i messaged my ex friend on Snapchat and said that I know she stole my card. She said it was a mistake, that’s she’s sorry, and will pay me back $2009. I took screenshots of the messages. I called the nonemergency line later that day and told the person on the phone that I have proof of confession and that the charges are more than originally thought. They said the message will be relayed to the deputy on the case and I should be getting a call back.

It is now 4/10/25 and I have not heard back from the deputy on the case. I have also gotten confirmation from her parents that she has fled to Nevada (Fort Nellis) to be with her boyfriend. 

What can I do? Is there any further action I can take? Should I call the nonemergency line again? I feel like she has gotten away with a crime without any consequences. ",1,1744310771.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

One of them was this '40s (or early '50s) Spartus 35F camera. It's got three apertures (f/7.7, f/11/ f/16) and one shutter speed (probably 1/50s). There is a built in K2 filter which is great for high-contrast photography, but it's only available at f/7.7! 

The first example photo was at f/11 and the other two were at f/7.7 so you can see lots of DOF blur. The camera has only a viewfinder and scale focus, so good luck nailing it unless you're at f/16!

How would you want it to end?  
The love, the story, the version of yourself you were with them?

Would you want a clean break?  
Like the kind in your favorite mug, dropped, split neatly.  
The kind that, in theory, could be glued back together.  
You could hold it again, even drink from it.  
But you’d always know it’s broken now.  
Even if no one else sees it, you know.  
And it’ll never be whole again.

Or would you rather it shatter into a thousand sharp edges?  
So jagged you couldn’t possibly pick it up again.  
So final, you don’t even try.  
Would you gather the shards anyway?  
Risk cutting yourself, just to feel something?  
Or would you leave them there,  
hoping, maybe, to step on one one day...  
Just to remind yourself that you once had something worth missing.

And what if you were the mug?  
Would you want to be set down gently?  
Or dropped with purpose?

What does it feel like to free-fall?  
Exhilarating?  
Like a carnival ride that shakes your stomach and makes you laugh in fear.  
A moment where everything suspends in air...  
until gravity brings you back.  
Back down to the floor of your own expectations.  
To the moment of impact  
where the dream ends, and the shattering begins.

And if you could hold the mug one more time…  
Would you stay up late the night before?  
To enjoy that last cup once more?  
Just a little more?  
Would you pour the coffee slower?  
Make it sweeter?  
Or with the right amount of sugar?  
Let the smell linger, the way she used to?  
Would you sip it slower?  
Would you kiss the rim,  
hold the handle like you were made for it?  
If you knew it was your last time,  
would you even bother to clean it,  
absolve it of the stains?  
Would you take a picture?  
So you can visit it in the mornings when the ache hits?  
Would that be enough?

Would you dream of her?  
Why would you?  
She was just a mug.

But you took her with you on your first road trip.  
You took her with you when you moved to the new city.  
She was your constant.  
She felt like home.  
She woke you like the sunrise.  
She calmed you like chamomile.  
She knew your hands like no one else.

Will you find the day you feel fine?  
Because now other people might drink from her.

Does it hurt?  
Do you flinch at the guilt of choosing other mugs  
while she was still whole in your hands?  
Do you wonder if she’d still be whole  
if you hadn’t dropped her?  
Do you ask yourself, late at night,  
if it was carelessness or cowardice?  
If you let her slip?  
Or did you let her go?

Does it haunt you, the moment you let her fall?  
The part of you that heard the cracking sound  
and didn’t try to catch her in time?

You tell yourself it had to break.  
That you couldn’t go on drinking from something already stained.  
But even now, do you wish you’d held on tighter?

Do you hate yourself for dropping her?  
Not by accident.  
Not like forgetting to switch the lights off.  
But with the kind of force  
you slam cabinet doors when you argue.

How do you let something go with care?  
Do you wrap her in bubble wrap made of lies?  
Do you say, “It’s not you, it’s me,”  
while placing her gently on the floor...  
only to smash her anyway  
with the hammer of your truth?

I’ve had this issue before, back when I was 17 after I finished school. I would sleep all day, wake up, and be asleep again 10 minutes later. It got so bad that it even happened during my niece’s birthday. I slept in the car on the way there, slept on the floor inside the house, and then slept again on the way back. It went on like that for about a week. And at that time, I never drank coffee or had any caffeine at all.

Then it happened again when I was 19. I had spent a whole week playing a game — sleep for an hour, wake up, play again — and after that, it was the same thing: I’d sleep, wake up for maybe 10 minutes, then I’d be out cold again. Still no coffee, no caffeine.

Now I’m 28, and it’s happening again. I have a 4-year-old now, and I’ve been in and out of sleep constantly. I’ve even been trying to have coffee, but today I went to go take a nap and the whole time I was trying to get up… I couldn’t. I tried — I really did — but it felt like I was paralyzed. No energy to move at all.

And this happened after I had a big fight with our housemates — the ones we kicked out — who thought it’d be a great idea to break in and help themselves to our stuff. I used everything I had in me to protect my home and my daughter.

I do know I have a vitamin D deficiency and low iron. But I don’t really go out in the sun much, and my iron’s probably low because I don’t eat much meat. Plus, I’ve heard drinks like Coke or coffee can use up iron quicker too, so that might not be helping either",1,1744310146.0,GetOutOfBed,2,1.0,False

(5 yoe)","I hope this post can help others. I am thrilled and relieved; I have had many periods of hopelessness throughout this process and I hope that sharing my experience can renew some hope for some folks who are in a similar position as I was.

Recently, I received multiple remote offers. I went with one paying a 145-160k salary with a Fortune 500 company. I am keeping this post a little vague to hide any identifying details.

I was not targeting super elite companies or positions, and nothing FAANG, so this may not be as relevant if you are. I am in the US.

Sorry for my nearly stream-of-consciousness bullet points!

* I have \~5 years of experience in a full stack capacity with a popular tech stack, all at the same small and unknown company
* I was laid off >6 months and <1 year ago.
* I started job hunting (besides some half-hearted applications to keep unemployment) 2-3 months ago. Before that, I was going through a very difficult time mentally and had done *nothing* to brush up on my technical skills.
* I was ""open to work"" on LinkedIn during this time (without the banner), but scarcely got any recruiter messages (perhaps 1 every 2 months).
* For about the first month of job hunting, I sent out cold applications on Indeed, LinkedIn, and company websites. I did get two interviews for hybrid roles in my area, but nothing for remote roles.
* I do have a well-formed resume and perform excellently with any kind of behavioral question.
   * My favorite resource for behavioral interviewing has been Austen McDonald's substack. [This](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/p/using-the-carl-method-to-structure) post was the most helpful for me, but I would recommend checking out the other posts as well!
* I do think I do excellent work in a real job setting, but I am pretty bad at leetcode and system design, and get horribly nervous when live-coding in an interview setting!
* After the first month of job hunting, I said, ""Fuck it"" and put the obnoxious green #OPENTOWORK banner on my LinkedIn profile photo. I had always heard it makes people look ""desperate"", so I had never tried it. Y'all, **my inbox exploded** the *day* after I did this, and recruiters even mentioned that they were reaching out to me *because* they had noticed it. I'm talking 1 recruiter message per month at best, to 10 the next day, and \~10-15 per week after that. I did get sent a handful of irrelevant positions, but nothing I couldn't sift through.
   * I cannot emphasize how much this is worth trying. Maybe it deters some recruiters, but it attracts a lot of worthwhile ones too, at least for the non-elite positions I was targeting.
* I updated my LinkedIn headline and bio to have a bunch of keywords. I edited my bio once a week, even just to reword it a little bit. I suspected that this helped keep me higher in recruiter searched results. Not sure if that was true or not, but it didn't hurt.
* I had some bites from continuing to cold-apply, and some of them were remote positions too - but these interviews were much harder and the recruiters for these were much flakier and less enthused overall.
* I got a ton of traction from the recruiters in my inbox. The offers I later received all stemmed from recruiters in my inbox. There are definitely a lot of companies that rely entirely on recruiters and don't even bother with making job listings.
* In the interviews for the companies that then gave me an offer - there was no leetcode and no typical system design. Besides behavioral questions, some of the technical portions involved questions about domain knowledge, OOP, design patterns, ""how would you approach this problem"" kind of questions, and some code reviews. I answered them well, but definitely not perfectly, and had some misses as well. Despite that - I was told by all of my interviewers that they loved me as a candidate!
* Most interviewers did not give a single shit about my time off. Some did ask, but totally understood when I said it was a layoff. If they then asked me about the gap, I explained it as being due to grief, and also taking some time to do a non-tech (but cool and unique) project to support a family member. I emphasized that I only began to job hunt seriously in the past 2-3 months.
   * For those who have been hunting for longer - maybe it's worth considering making the beginning of that gap sound intentional rather than like you've been getting rejected for a long time? YMMV
* Having multiple final interviews resulting in multiple offers on the same day felt very serendipitous (and gave me great leverage for negotiating), but the end-of-the-quarter timing probably factored in.

Thanks for reading, and good luck!

*Definitely would recommend the substack I mentioned above (*[*here's the top posts*](https://thebehavioral.substack.com/archive?sort=top)*) - honestly such a great and free resource. I have found all of his posts helpful!*

*Before interviews I do a little meditation with* [*4-7-8 breathing*](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/324417) *and it helps calm my nerves. This was a tip from my therapist. Sometimes I will take 100 mg of*[ *l-theanine* ](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-1053/theanine)*with my morning coffee too, I find it helps with anxiety without dulling my alertness.*

*Having the attitude of a good coworker goes a long way - arguably it's even more important than being technically competent. Imagine the kind of person that you would want to work with. Show that you are humble, willing to admit when you don't know something, curious, not afraid to ask questions, proactive, easygoing, focused on the big picture/business impact, and have a growth mindset.*

*Find a list of common questions, take some notes on how you would plan on answering them, and actually practice answering them out loud to yourself, or even better, to a friend. Practice until it's like muscle memory. There are some software interviewing discords (try the search bar), where I bet you could find some people to practice mock interviews with if you don't have anyone in your personal life. Have a few stories prepared that could apply to multiple questions with a little tweaking.*

*When answering questions, I try to find little opportunities to show off my knowledge and experience even if doing so isn't the most straightforward way of answering the question - e.g. I will connect the question to a project I did or a problem I have solved before, will mention a relevant case study to show that I keep up with industry trends, will mention a quirk of the domain that shows high-level understanding, etc. Don't go on a huge tangent if it's not directly answering the question, but an offhand sentence or two is okay. I've gotten some great reactions and feedback from interviews from doing this.*

*I always send a thank-you email after the interview too, with some details specific to what they had shared with me about the position and the company.*

1jw556a,https://www.reddit.com/r/goatravel/comments/1jw556a/didnt_like_goa_my_recent_experience/,Didn't Like Goa  --- My Recent Experience,"I just got back from a week-long trip to Goa with a friend. I'd love to say it was a dreamy beach vacation. Instead, it felt like a crash course in how hype, incompetence, and indifference can masquerade as a tourist paradise. Here's the unvarnished truth.

1. Inconvenience: A Masterclass in Making Life Difficult

In Gurugram, you can get anything—food, medicine, stationery, a bloody soldering iron—delivered to your doorstep faster than you can change your mind. In Goa? Good luck.

Essentials are not just hard to find—they’re often non-existent. No Uber. No Rapido. Public transport is practically a rumour, and autos are an endangered species. If you don’t drive, you’re trapped. And I mean that literally. Delivery services are laughably limited or completely absent. Goa, somehow, is both over-touristed and utterly under-equipped for basic life.

2. Expense: Welcome to the Tourist Tax Twilight Zone

Unless you enjoy haemorrhaging money, brace yourself. Taxis cost a bomb, especially if you need one fast or at night. It’s not “a little expensive,” it’s “is-this-a-joke” expensive.

Swiggy and Zomato? A barren wasteland. Ordering food feels like sending a message in a bottle—you’re not sure if it’ll arrive or when. Dining out? Overpriced. For a small, laid-back state, Goa charges like it’s Monaco. I get that tourism drives up prices, but this felt more like daylight robbery wrapped in banana leaves.

3. Services: Glowing Google Reviews, Grim Reality

Goa is the only place where every coffee shop, pharmacy, and bookstore has 4.8 stars and yet feels like a half-functioning roadside stall. Either bots are reviewing these places or people have shockingly low standards.

Shops open and shut whenever the owners feel like it—no logic, no schedule, no warning. Need something simple like razor blades? Too bad. One major pharmacy near Reis Magos looked at me like I was asking for plutonium.

Word of advice: don’t trust star ratings. Dive into the one-star reviews and read the owner's responses (if any). That’s where the real Goa lives—in the comments section, seething with indifference and passive-aggressive replies.

4. Locals: If Not Hostile, Then Thoroughly Unpleasant

No, I wasn’t assaulted by the infamous taxi mafia. But if you’re expecting basic human warmth, manage those expectations.

In shops, at cafes, at tourist attractions—interacting with the average Goan local feels like asking someone to file your taxes for free. You’re met with sighs, scowls, or blank stares. Manners are optional. Politeness is mythical.

One gem: I rented a scooter in Reis Magos for a week but had to return it a day early. When I asked (politely) if a refund was possible, the guy told me, in Hindi, that he didn't want tourists ""begging for refunds.” Classy.

5. Tourist Attractions: Looks Better on a Postcard

I had two must-visit spots: Reis Magos Church and the Basilica of Bom Jesus. The church? Closed 24/7, unless you happen to be around on a Sunday morning between 7 and 7:30 AM or whatever ridiculous slot it actually opens for. No one mentions that in the brochures.

The Basilica? It was a disappointing experience. But that story deserves its own rant. You can read my detailed takedown here: [https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Basilica+of+Bom+Jesus/@15.503979,73.9100595,17z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x3bbfbef2b99b0289:0x1e8056689f15a7b8!8m2!3d15.5008238!4d73.9114061!9m1!1b1!16zL20vMDVuaHZm?hl=en&entry=ttu&g\_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Basilica+of+Bom+Jesus/@15.503979,73.9100595,17z/data=!4m8!3m7!1s0x3bbfbef2b99b0289:0x1e8056689f15a7b8!8m2!3d15.5008238!4d73.9114061!9m1!1b1!16zL20vMDVuaHZm?hl=en&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDQwOC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

Conclusion: A Mirage of a Destination

Goa is the Instagram girlfriend of Indian destinations—gorgeous in photos, insufferable in real life. Unless you're rich, willing to drive yourself everywhere, and happy to accept mediocrity with a smile, you're better off going literally anywhere else.

Behind the palm trees and sunsets lies a place that seems deeply uninterested in being functional, let alone welcoming. I came looking for peace. I left with a deeper appreciation for Gurugram traffic and a mild case of consumer rage.",2,1744310001.0,goatravel,5,0.58,False

I’ve been suffering from yeast infection on and off for about 1 year. I’ve tried medications given by doctors but nothing has helped. I get these paper cuts like slits around the vagina. The discharge is sometimes discoloured like a light green/yellow mucus and smells bad.

However, all these things completely disappear during my periods. Has anyone else faced something like this?

Also for the longest time I have been suffering from bloating, passing gas a lot, even when I’m eating clean and on time. 

I feel like I damaged my stomach by having black coffee in morning and by intermittent fasting, allowing acid build up. In my quest to lose weight I have completely effed up my stomach. 

Can anyone suggest what I should do next? Please note that I’m not in US so may not have same medicine available. I’ll try to find any substitute. But any insights into why this is happening and ways to stop it would be helpful. Thanks

I got a cheap OTC hearing aide of Amazon and today is my first day using it. 

Background: I'm 30F and have some hearing loss/damage after a bizarre accident about 15yrs ago where I was shocked in my left ear by a pair of in ear metal tipped headphones - I know, weird, sounds fake, but it's true). I haven't seen an audiologist in probably 10 years, but last time I saw one he was finally able to figure out that although I can perceive volume fine, I struggle to/cannot understand speech well through my left ear. He didn't offer any real solutions at the time. 

I finally gave in and looked at OTC hearing aides, I hadn't thought they would help me since volume isn't the problem. But I was getting desperate because I have young kids and in addition struggling to follow conversation in even moderately noisy environments and not being able to hear people over service counters (like at a coffee shop), I struggle greatly to hear and understand my 2 & 4 year old when they speak. And it's frustrating all of us. 

Anyway, an impulse purchase of the cheapest OTC HA I could get next day, and I've found that my hearing loss was actually affecting me a lot more than I realized. It's much easier to understand my kids, I can hear people coming up behind me from my left side, and my laptop keyboard makes noise when I type! 🤣🤦




So my question, (I'm planning to see an audiologist to get properly tested, But I don't have high hopes that I'll qualify for prescription hearing aids as my hearing has consistently tested as normal despite my struggles). I'm planning to use the cheapo ones that I bought for the next month or two to make sure that I'm really going to use them and then I want to look at investing in some of the nicer over the counter options. The ones I got are the more traditional over the ear style. Comfort wise I'm fine with them. But I typically use bone conducting headphones and  I thought those would still work while wearing the HA but they don't. I use my headphones / headset frequently due to my job because I spend a lot of time working at a computer while on the phone. Since I'm only using an HA in my right ear, it's not that hard to just pull it out while on the phone. But I wasn't sure if the in-ear style might work better? I know they make some that can be used for calls/music, but I mostly talk on the phone with older people and have found that the only style head set I can use where they can consistently hear me is a set with a boom mic. Has anyone tried bone conducting headphones with a hearing aide? Or is that just a completely crazy idea and I just need to either live with not hearing calls from that ear or pulling the HA out during calls? ",1,1744309718.0,HearingAids,8,1.0,False
1jw50y5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jw50y5/what_does_your_perfect_breakup_look_like/,What Does Your Perfect Breakup Look Like?,"Have you ever asked yourself?  
How would you want it to end?  
The love, the story, the version of yourself you were with them?

Would you want a clean break?  
Like the kind in your favorite mug, dropped, split neatly.  
The kind that, in theory, could be glued back together.  
You could hold it again, even drink from it.  
But you’d always know it’s broken now.  
Even if no one else sees it, you know.  
And it’ll never be whole again.

Or would you rather it shatter into a thousand sharp edges?  
So jagged you couldn’t possibly pick it up again.  
So final, you don’t even try.  
Would you gather the shards anyway?  
Risk cutting yourself, just to feel something?  
Or would you leave them there,  
hoping, maybe, to step on one one day...  
Just to remind yourself that you once had something worth missing.

And what if you were the mug?  
Would you want to be set down gently?  
Or dropped with purpose?

What does it feel like to free-fall?  
Exhilarating?  
Like a carnival ride that shakes your stomach and makes you laugh in fear.  
A moment where everything suspends in air...  
until gravity brings you back.  
Back down to the floor of your own expectations.  
To the moment of impact  
where the dream ends, and the shattering begins.

And if you could hold the mug one more time…  
Would you stay up late the night before?  
To enjoy that last cup once more?  
Just a little more?  
Would you pour the coffee slower?  
Make it sweeter?  
Or with the right amount of sugar?  
Let the smell linger, the way she used to?  
Would you sip it slower?  
Would you kiss the rim,  
hold the handle like you were made for it?  
If you knew it was your last time,  
would you even bother to clean it,  
absolve it of the stains?  
Would you take a picture?  
So you can visit it in the mornings when the ache hits?  
Would that be enough?

Would you dream of her?  
Why would you?  
She was just a mug.

But you took her with you on your first road trip.  
You took her with you when you moved to the new city.  
She was your constant.  
She felt like home.  
She woke you like the sunrise.  
She calmed you like chamomile.  
She knew your hands like no one else.

Will you find the day you feel fine?  
Because now other people might drink from her.

Does it hurt?  
Do you flinch at the guilt of choosing other mugs  
while she was still whole in your hands?  
Do you wonder if she’d still be whole  
if you hadn’t dropped her?  
Do you ask yourself, late at night,  
if it was carelessness or cowardice?  
If you let her slip?  
Or did you let her go?

Does it haunt you, the moment you let her fall?  
The part of you that heard the cracking sound  
and didn’t try to catch her in time?

You tell yourself it had to break.  
That you couldn’t go on drinking from something already stained.  
But even now, do you wish you’d held on tighter?

Do you hate yourself for dropping her?  
Not by accident.  
Not like forgetting to switch the lights off.  
But with the kind of force  
you slam cabinet doors when you argue.

How do you let something go with care?  
Do you wrap her in bubble wrap made of lies?  
Do you say, “It’s not you, it’s me,”  
while placing her gently on the floor...  
only to smash her anyway  
with the hammer of your truth?

You thought I was done with telling tale from my college years? (Then again I did hinted and say there was more but anyway.) I'm back to tell you a totally new story that continues from the last one. This one I don't know how many parts is going to have because this one is going to be all over the place. Also I'm pretty sure this going to be hard to write down because at this time, I was under the haze of painkillers. (Also sorry for any mistakes I make, I'm still trying to English)

**Lets meet the characters!**

**Dizzy:** Hey that's me! 19 going on 20 and really living the name ""Dizzy"". I'm better now but oof, healing from the head trauma was not easy. You can really guess I tend to make jokes about my situations.

**Goodfella:** The 18 year old elder gay, my ""buddy"" and helping me during my transition.

**Sourface:** The 21 year old mean-girl in a fat man's body, big time dick in this one.

**Mrs. Face:** The 50-something year old mother of Goodfella and Sourface.

**Mr. Fella:** The 50-something year old father to also Goodfella and Sourface.

**Artlad:** The 19 year old that made it possible for me to become ""Dizzy"".

**Bestbro:** The 19 year old Big brother of the friend group.

**Lets start!**

This tale starts us right after of the end of the last saga, however this time it's at the first day of winter semester. I finally came out to my family that I'm trans and I'm happy to say they supported me and my transition. Artlad and Sourface were the last ones to find out I was transitioning, Artlad found out during thanksgiving break and Sourface somehow found out but not sure how. I know what you're thinking, ""Dizzy why the hell are hanging out with Sourface? Didn't he made you uncomfortable?"" To answer that is simply that Goodfella and I became really good ""friends"" and Sourface is Goodfella's brother so he would pop up for reasons that'll come up soon. Artlad on the other hand, was trying make up to me for being a bad friend and was also trying to built up trust with Bestbro. The group knows I started to hang out with Goodfella but Bestbro would always end our convos with ""keep an eye out on Goodfella, I don't trust him"" but at the time I thought he was acting like an older brother for no reason but now I know better.

On that first day back on campus, I just started to not only socially transition but also medically. So I literally started the semester sounding like a squeaker from Xbox live. I was coming out of the student center but instead of me being this starry eyed kid, I became this jaded dude who's praying that I don't meet another crazy bish. I headed to the campus book store when I hear a familiar voice. ""Hello Dizzy"" I hear and I turn to see Goodfella.

**Me: Oh hey Goodfella. How was your thanksgiving?**

**Goodfella: I spend my first thanksgiving alone. To be honest, I love not having to hear that I'm ""going to hell"" every five minutes. What about you?**

**Me: Same thing every year. Eat tamales, drink booze and shit talk!**

Goodfella looks at me as if there's more. But there's isn't and he says:

**Goodfella: That's it?**

**Me: Yeah. Why you ask?**

Goodfella lets out a sigh and we talk about our thanksgivings in life, I learn already we grew up different, he had money, I did not. I remember him says he had an art class and I ask which one. He had the same one I was taking at the same hour. Gotta love those small world coincidences. Talking back and forth about my degree of graphic design and his business degree, that's when I remembered something about Sourface.

**Me: Oh I forgot to ask. Did Sourface really get cut off?**

**Goodfella: Duh! Last time I've heard my mom and dad are trying for him to work or help my father at his job.**

**Me: Oof, are they....planning to kick him out?**

**Goodfella: Who knows! Speaking of family homes, can I ask you a favor?**

**Me: I am not flirting with anyone! I've learned my lesson.**

As I say while rubbing my head. I'm not same anymore, I really did grief the fact I can't never experience getting black out drunk like a true college kid and could never go on a rollercoaster ever again. The headaches/migraines from vertigo is not worth it (I've learned the hard way). Goodfella, however just slaps my shoulder and says:

**Goodfella: No I don't mean that. I just need help moving some stuff from my parents place into mine's.**

**Me: Ok yeah I think I'm good enough to left some heavy boxes.**

**Goodfella: Thanks Dizzy.**

He pats my shoulder and we head to our shared class. The rest of the day was nothing to note. we talk about heading to his folks place that day just get it over with and I remember feeling weird that I'm heading to a place where I could run into Sourface and they are related to Queenie but then I also remembered ""Oh wait! I'm a boy now!"" We entered his car and headed to his folks place and I've never felt poorer, his family lives 45 minutes from the campus and they live in this old school Americana house, like from the 1930's in California. I felt judged just simply entering the neighborhood. Goodfella looks over from his seat and says:

**Goodfella: Welp, we're almost close to my old home.**

**Me: So what kind of stuff are we moving?**

**Goodfella: It's just some clothes and things. Not much.**

We stop in front of this white house. I swear on my life it look like something from an 50's magazine. White picket fence, fresh mowed lawn, American flag on the porch, the whole nine yards. I get out the car following Goodfella as he knocks on the door. His mother, Mrs. Face, opens the door. Picture your typical soccer mom with the ""Martha"" haircut. Not a Karen haircut, like the haircut that someone named Martha would wear (I don't know the name of the haircut and it's not a beehive) like big hair. She goes in for a hug and says:

**Mrs. Face: OH! Goodfella it's sooooo good to see you!**

**Goodfella: Uhhh...hi mom.**

Then she sees me.

**Mrs. Face: Oh! And who is this?**

**Me: Hello I'm Dizzy, Goodfella's friend. Nice to meet you Mrs....uhh...**

**Mrs. Face: Oh call me Mrs. Face. It's good to see one of Goodfella's friends. You know he hardly brings anyone here unlike his brother.**

**Goodfella: Mom, we're not staying for long. I'm here for my stuff.**

She steps aside and I wipe my shoes on the mat cuz I wasn't born in a barn, I entered to see they decorated their home with antique furniture, family photos, just a normal home and very clean too. Mrs. Face with a smile she yells:

**Mrs. Face: HONEY! YOUR SON IS HOME! SOURFACE COME GREET YOUR BROTHER!**

In comes Mr. Fella and he looks like Sourface if he aged 30 years and got his shit together in a gray suit. He sees us and smile while saying:

**Mr. Fella: Welcome back son! You finally brought a friend.**

**Goodfella: Hey dad.**

**Me: Hello sir, name's Dizzy.**

**Mr. Fella: I'm Mr. Fella.**

I shake his hand. I smile but all could think of is ""is this the same family Goodfella dislikes? They seem so nice.""

**Mrs. Face: Why don't you two stay for some tea and treats! We love to know more about your little friend there!**

**Goodfella: Thanks but no thanks mom. We're just here to pick up my stuff.**

**Mr. Fella: Come on, your mother worked really hard on those treats.**

**Mrs. Face: Just one little cup. SOURFACE GET YOUR BUTT OVER HERE!**

Have you guys seen Goof troop? Imagine the first episode with Pete's wife meeting Goofy for the first time but more beardy. I clear my throat and say:

**Me: Thank you for offering but it wasn't necessary of you. I'm sorry we're little busy.**

**Mrs. Face: Nonsense, come on lets sit at the sofa and I'll set the coffee table.**

**Mr. Fella: I'll help ya honey.**

She then takes Goodfella by the arm and basically brags him and sits him down. I follow along because again, I wasn't born a barn and I don't want to be rude. I sit next to Goodfella and his mom says ""now stay and make yourselves comfy"" and she leaves, I lightly elbow him and say:

**Me: Dude are these the same parents you've been telling me about? They seem nice.**

**Goodfella: They're nice because you're here. I hope my brother stays in his room.**

**Sourface: Why? Afraid of the alpha of the family?**

Guys, gals and non-binary pals, it's the good, the bad and the PFFT.

**Goodfella: Oh great.**

**Sourface:** \*looks at me\* **YOU!**

**Me: Me!**

**Sourface: The hell you doing here?**

**Me: Helping Goodfella get his things, you know, like a good friend.**

**Sourface: It's bad enough you got me in trouble with my uncle and now you're a no good \[t-slur\].**

**Me: It's not my fault you have the hots for Queenie. Also you're just mad I can grow better facial hair in a few months then you in years.**

**Sourface: Pfft. That swung must have fucked with your brain.**

He goes to sit on the recliner and just when their parents comes back with a tray. Mr. fella swats Sourface at the back of the head with a ""off of my sit boy"" and Sourface sits next to his mom across from Goodfella and I. Mrs. Face takes a sip of her tea and says:

**Mrs. Face: Goodfella, I know you're trying to live on your own.**

**Mr. Fella: We where wondering if you can help us with something?**

**Goodfella: Mom, Dad, please this isn't the time.**

**Mrs. Face: But you do have the time to hang out with someone who may or may not ruined your brother.**

That's the moment that I knew that they knew me. Makes sense since Queenie is family. However, that whole ordeal was being handled by my folks since I was recovering the at hospital and I have no clue what happened in court. The only thing I know is that there were too many witnesses that saw. So I almost choked on my tea and I quickly said:

**Me: Mrs. Face, please understand that what she did to me has nothing to do with your son.**

**Goodfella: Plus, Uncle did say if he caught them again he will cut us off.**

**Mr. Fella: That we know, However we're not here to fight nor to make your friend here feel sad.**

**Goodfella: Then?**

**Mrs. Face: We were hoping if you could help us pay for Sourface's college fees?**

**Goodfella: NO!**

**Mrs. Face: But Goodfella-**

**Goodfella: I don't have enough money to pay for two people. Plus, He's already taking over dad's job so there's no point for him to go to college.**

**Mr. Fella: I know son I know this is much but your brother really wants his degree.**

**Sourface: Plus why would you need a Business degree anyway? A beta \[gay-slur that's worst then the f-slur\] would need to go to college anyway?**

**Mrs. Face: SOURFACE!**

**Mr. Fella:** \*though gritted teeth\* **Boy I swear to god-**

**Goodfella: Look mom and dad, I simply do not have enough money.**

I was starting to feel awkward so ease the tension I add:

**Me: Maybe Sourface could look into student-aid.**

**Sourface: HELL NO, I'M NOT POOR!**

Fuck you Sourface, not everybody is born to a family with money. I was under student-aid and this rubbed me the wrong way. Goodfella just being done with this, he got up and says:

**Goodfella: Look mom and dad, I can't help Sourface. I'm sorry. Come on Dizzy, lets get my things.**

I got up saying thank you for the tea and follow Goodfella to his old room. If I remember correctly, his old room was mostly empty, just a plain bed, some old drawers but near the closet is six big boxes. In a low voice, while grabbing one, Goodfella tells me:

**Goodfella: I'm sorry about that. I didn't know they would do that.**

**Me: It's fine dude. I didn't think they knew who I was.**

**Goodfella: My uncle and my father are very close. My father however is sad that me and Sourface don't have the same bond like he has his own brother.**

**Me: I didn't know Sourface really wants a degree.**

**Goodfella: It's not the degree he wants, It's the chance of him getting laid.**

**Me: Aaah! Got it.**

As we move back and forth with boxes and putting them in his car, we're getting the last ones when I smelled something awful.

**Me: Dude, what's that smell?**

**Goodfella: It's across the hall.**

**Me: Across?**

**Goodfella: My brother's room.**

**Me: Why would it smell bad?**

Dear reader, at the time I wasn't aware about beard-nests and I was confused is to why would anyone would sleep in a smelly room. However, speak of the devil and he will appear.

**Sourface: Hey Goodfella, I can't believe you're actually leaving. Pfft, I guess I use this as my new gaming room.**

**Goodfella: Fat chance! Mom told me she's using my room as her new sewing room. And, I've said yes.**

**Sourface: WHAT!?**

**Goodfella: Also you might want to clean your room before mom yells at you, AGAIN!**

**Sourface: I don't take orders from betas like you! If you have such a problem why don't you clean it?**

**Me: Dude, what the fuck is that smell though? It's one thing to have a messy room but why the smell?**

**Sourface: You still have the female nose I see. You think it smells bad but really you just smelling things that aren't there.**

Remember, Sourface himself doesn't smell bad and he shaves too so I did find it weird that his room smelled.

**Goodfella: Look alpha-shit, I smell it too. If mom or dad come near here you're going to get an earful.**

**Sourface: How do you know it's from my room and not your's hmmm?**

**Me: A smell coming from an almost empty room? You think your folks and us are fucking stupid?**

**Sourface: I'm smarter then a couple fags that's for sure.**

**Me: Smart enough to bang your cousin I guess.**

**Goodfella: Come on lets go, We got what we need anyway.**

We walk pass Sourface to head back to the car but just about Goodfella close the door, we heard that now I know as the legbeard REEE, we froze as we hear Mrs. Face yelling at Sourface to ""CLEAN YOUR FUCKING ROOM! WE HAD A GUEST! SOOOOOURFACE! WHHHHYYYY!"" Goodfella and I just look at each other with the ""ooohhhh, someone is in trouble"" kind of look and only people with siblings make. As soon we entered the car and drive off, we burst out laughing. As we're driving to Goodfella's new apartment I get a text from Bestbro. It says ""Hey Dizzy, Artlad and I are wondering if you want to hang out later. We're meeting this new café near my campus."" I look at Goodfella and say:

**Me: Dude, my pal Bestbro wants hang out later on today. I can't stay at your place today.**

**Goodfella: Will Artlad be there?**

**Me: Well duh, we're in kinda good terms but knowing these two, Bestbro asking for Artlad since he's working on himself.**

**Goodfella: I don't know, I mean I don't mind if you do but it would be nice to hang out in my place with you, ya know.**

**Me: Dude, we could to that tomorrow. I swear! Or do you want me to ask if it's ok for you to tag along?**

**Goodfella: No no, it's fine. Tomorrow would fine actually!**

**Me: Sweet, I'll finish here with ya and head out to them.**

I texted Bestbro sure and ask what time however at the time I didn't think twice about Goodfella's ""concerns"" about me hanging out with Artlad. Like I said, he was working hard and I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. After arriving and helping him with his boxes, I bid him goodbye and headed to the café where Bestbro and Artlad was waiting. Something to note, this college town houses a well known university but not that well known so the closer to the campus, the more expensive it gets. So if Bestbro wanted to go to that place means it's worth it to go because he's known as a penny-pincher. This café was in front of the train station that I was taking and it was a old school style café that was built to look like it's from the 70's and there was Bestbro waiting.

**Me: Hey Bestbro!**

**Bestbro: Dizzy! How's the growing baby boy!**

**Me: sCrEw YoU dIcK!** \*I slap my mouth and turn beet red\*

I remember having my voice breaking and feeling silly as Bestbro was laughing. Looking back, it really was funny not going to lie.

**Bestbro:** \*wheeze\* **HOLY CRAP! YOU SOUND LIKE THE LITTLE BOYS FROM C.O.D.!**

**Me: Not Funny!**

**Artlad: Looks like the growing pains are starting.**

This is the part where I did a double take. Artlad wasn't wearing his sporty clothes, instead he was wearing what look like to be like punk-ish. I asked:

**Me: Dude what's with the clothes?**

**Bestbro:** \*pulls me closer and in a low voice\* **He's going though something, be nice.**

**Artlad: Oh! This? It just something I wanted try out. What do you think?**

**Me: It looks......good.**

**Artlad: Awesome!**

We enter the café and sit down, waiting to be served and Bestbro cleared his throat and says:

**Bestbro: Dizzy, I'm glad you came here however there's something all three of us need to talk about.**

**Me: like?**

**Artlad:** \*his smile chances to something scary\* **Why the fuck would you give Queenie a fucking list of things that I ""like"" Dizzy?**

I never did say I getting away easy. I knew this convo need to happened so with a deep breath I answered:

**Me: Look Artlad, I did it to help out Goodfella.**

**Artlad: Oh that makes it better!**

**Me: Well at less I didn't air out a friend's story to a fucking creep!**

**Bestbro: Shut up you two! Both are in the wrong.**

**Me: I know that, I was stupid ok. That bitch put me in the hospital anyway.**

**Artlad: Dizzy, you couldn't even tell me you're trans. Bestbro told me during break.**

**Me: Yet you ran away leaving me and Bestbro to clean up after you.**

**Artlad: How am I suppose know Queenie was unhinge. You put me into something scary Dizzy. She stalk me to the point I was afraid to leave my apartment.**

**Me: And yet when I told about Sourface and him following me from class to class and acting weird to me. you responded with ""he doesn't have class on Monday!"" like really?**

**Artlad: Well, now that you're a guy, he's gross out now!**

**Bestbro: Artlad...**

**Artlad: What?! It's true!**

**Me:** \*sigh\* **I'm sorry Artlad.**

**Artlad: I'm also sorry for everything Dizzy. You shouldn't been the one to get hurt.**

**Bestbro: So how's your head by the way?**

**Me: Awesome! I love feeling sea sick when I'm on land!**

**Artlad: DUDE!**

**Me: What?! It's true!**

Bestbro all he can do is laugh because I guess why not, and the server came by with menus and we order and the rest of the stay was pretty nice but I remember the tuna sandwich I ordered wasn't worth the money I spend it on. As we headed out Bestbro ask if he could take me since he knows I still don't have a car and with that ""our convo between you and me was not over"". I followed to his car and talked while driving:

**Bestbro: Dizzy, I may known you less then Artlad but I know enough what makes you tick. I still don't like you hanging around with Goodfella.**

**Me: Why? He's the only friend I can relate to when come to the queer stuff. He's been nice to me and he's the one to help me with everything really.**

**Bestbro: Dizzy, I'm glad you're finding your path but sometimes you're dense as fuck!**

**Me: How am I dense?**

**Bestbro: Need I remind you the steps leading you to your hospitalization?**

**Me: Point taken but still, what is something I'm not seeing?**

**Bestbro: Let me answer that question with another question. When did you started being ok with being touch?**

**Me: HUH?! What do mean by-**

**Bestbro: You know what I'm talking about Dizzy.**

Side note, I don't really like to touch, I hardly give out hugs or be really close to people. I mostly give elbow bumps to people but only to the people I'm ok with. This question got off guard and I trying my best on what the hell he meant by that.

**Me: Bestbro, I don't understand.**

**Bestbro: Last time I've seen you with him, he tends to place his hand on your shoulder and slowly brings you closer.**

**Me: Dude, I always move away. I did tell him to not to touch me so much.**

**Bestbro: And?**

**Me: He says sorry and he then says he tends to show emotions though his hands.**

**Bestbro: Uh huh.**

**Me: Dude I swear nothing is going on. what's wrong with putting a hand on a shoulder anyway?**

**Bestbro: It's the bring you closer to him that seems off.**

**Me: Bestbro, you don't need to act like a big brother to me. I do tell him not to touch me so much.**

**Bestbro: Is it every time you two hang out?**

For some reason I clamed up when he said that. I was thinking over how many times Goodfella and I hang out and the times I've told him to ""please don't touch me"" and him going ""Ah! Sorry!"". Bestbro then said:

**Bestbro: You thinking about it is all the answer I need. Look Dizzy, sometimes you get a sixth sense about these things. But I could be wrong too.**

**Me: what do you mean?**

**Bestbro: Nothing really, just keep your eyes peeled. Goodfella is still Sourface's brother, and I hate that fat fuck.**

**Me: I don't hang out with him. Only Goodfella.**

Bestbro then quickly pulls out five small envelopes with some Greek letters and hands them to me.

**Bestbro: I almost forgot, I got this from a good buddy of mine on campus and I need invite some people to his frat-house so they could win the big party contest.**

**Me: Is one of them for me or?**

**Bestbro: Yes one of them is for you but, I hate to say it but I need help giving away the other four. Artlad already help me with some but-**

**Me: Oh! Maybe I could give one to Goodfella and the both of us can maybe find some chicks and-**

**Bestbro: Really? Him? Dizzy-**

**Me: Look I know but sometimes you need a couple of gay dudes making girls comfortable enough to come to the party.**

**Bestbro: I have a girlfriend Dizzy!**

**Me: Do you want your buddy's party to win or not?**

**Bestbro: Fine! Have your friends close but your enemies closer.**

I roll my eyes and he handed me the invites and I told him that was fine and there's nothing to worry about. As I got out the car Bestbro stopped me and told me ""Please start being aware of Goodfella"" and then drove off. I re-started writing in my journals at this time but they were un-understandable. I guess it from all that doctor ordered painkillers and among other things so looking back now, I could see why Bestbro was so afraid for me and maybe I was acting weird because of those meds but I don't know.

So I entered to my room and since I have the frat-house invites, I texted Goodfella if he's up to it and said yes. The party itself is going to be on the weekend of that semester and I have enough time for me to find ""frat"" clothes and to find three other people. But will the universe give the luck that I need?

* Entrepreneur men who think they are saving the world. Zero self awareness, zero life outside work, full desire to date but make zero effort. Please fuck off. 
* ""Nice guys"" so coddled by mothers and nice non problematic life, never took a risk, never dated outside comfort zone, have unrealistic idea of a life, woke in the streets, internalized misogyny in the sheets. 
* Married guys looking for side chicks. Bro your wife is literally breastfeeding your 3month old infant. Have some fucking shame. 
* ""Male friends"" trying to sleep with you. 
* Zero life skills. Can't cook clean or go to the doctor by themselves when sick. Were you raised by wolfs bro? Because even mowgli leads a more acceptable life. 
* Openly misogynistic, controlling man. Boss, first of all, that won't work with me. Second of all, no woman should give you the pleasure of her company because you genuinely hate women and your energy is scary as fuck. Stay away please. 
* Somehow you pass through all the hoops, bam, he is bad at sex , that becomes his entire personality and then his insecurity becomes the center of the relationship.
* Decent man who has none of the above problems but has commitment issues. Wants a situationship only. Bad at communication, creates unnecessary complications and runs away at the first sign of conflict. 
* Family guys. These guys have madonna whore complex. Twisted little motherfuckers with no spine. My brain will literally explode. 
* Addicts, severe mh issues but in denial mode.

That's insight right? Which means I probably don't have psychosis if I know it's weird? Like Ik how others would react if I talked about sending entities or all of the paranoia I have around things like my food being drugged at home and other things I mentioned to my therapist. 
Therapist I said he thinks I'm having hallucinations and delusions but I feel like him saying it shows that he doesn't really think it's psychosis either?

Basically wrote a letter about everything including things I was going to bring up but eventually veered into viewing as spiritual and I keep thinking that it was an overreaction. Sometimes yeah maybe it could be an issue and sometimes the stuff I get paranoid is super weird but I feel ok otherwise aside from really strong mood swings and the mess that happens after I drink coffee 

I told him I sensed entities trying to talk to me and heard living relatives communicate with me which I get. How it sounds but now I'm worried I just have some other issue with the paranoia and made a massive mistake I'm going to regret really badly by being open about spiritual experiences 

And yeah nothing I say would make said therapist go oh yeah my bad cause I was seeking therapy for paranoia
I feel like I'm too aware it's weird for it to be a severe issue. I get that it can be on a scale and I feel like he's probs wrong cause I don't feel disconnected from reality but of course that sounds... eh bad. 
Idk I called someone who suggested writing everything out in a letter and giving it to the therapist so I just wrote everything out cause originally I was going to tell some of it to the therapist once I got around to doing therapy but never brought it up and then by the time I started therapy I stopped thinking some things were problematic. I feel like I just was a blabber mouth, was feeling extremely energetic, didn't really use my filter like usual felt like it was off almost, and just got the courage to read it out loud not thinking of how that would affect anything 

So I basically just am hovering between massive massive regret and ""yeah maybe some of it is a mental health issue"". Plus the paranoia seems to not be getting better. It's gotten to the point of worrying there's telepathy devices in the house some random Arduino is probs one of them and everyone on campus is watching me.(not always for that last one like not today?)  and of course that sounds really concerning if I bring it up to anyone but if I was trully under a delusion why would I bring it up? Tbf I think k having a familly member who exhibits some level of paranoia made me more prone to being aware that I sounded paranoid perhaps

And yeah 👍 I possibly just fucked over my life irreparably and will be regretful forever cause he contacted someone to make sure I actually continue with treatment via text (this is all telehealth he wants me to see someone irl) honestly not sure what would happen if I didn't like follow up. Would I get into trouble? Idk, I'm following up though. 

But in the event that it is a developing mental health issue then I didn't fuck anything over which makes sense with the paranoia increasing and coffee making me get way more paranoid 

Doesn't help that I dropped my phone once and he likely saw the mess that is my car and my dental hygiene is really shit ;_; I'm working on that but I frequently just don't bother to floss or brush for days and at times weeks unless it hurts which is really bad

Once I started paying attention to calories I realized just exactly how I gained weight. All the little things that aren’t so little; sauces, granola bars, even a coffee from starbucks.

I used to be confused how I was gaining weight because I was “hardly eating”, but I was actually just eating very high calorie foods with no nutritional value, without even realizing. For example, going to dunkin’ donuts and getting a latte and a muffin. Then not eating all day until I went out to dinner and got chipotle, for example. I’d think to myself omg I barely ate, but I actually just over consumed calories like crazy! 

Now that I’m more intentional, I’m realizing how many 2500 calorie days I had while simultaneously starving. It’s wild to realize!  I know I used fast food as examples, and it should seem obvious, but it wasn’t.

I didn’t do this every day, but I’d usually have days where I’d have a coffee in the morning, starve all day, then eat something really calorie dense later on thinking that I barley ate… ",61,1744309236.0,loseit,12,0.98,False

I finished school mid to late 20s since it does take that long normally. So I’ve only been able to start actual work 6 months ago. I still live with them because of financial reasons. 

I’ve only realized their narcissism when I was finally able to discuss things with a therapist. I have both nmom and ndad, nmom is mostly covert, very victimizing and manipulative, ndad is very verbally abusive with immense anger issues, this is a very authoritarian and religious-driven family, as in, they use religion to excuse their actions. I am both golden child and scapegoat, they change it according to their mood. 

They have been very controlling of me since I was a child, a career in health care was the only choice they gave me, since I was supposed to “uphold the name of the family”, despite me not wanting to. Nmom has read my diaries when I was a teenager. They have tracked my phone to find my location and even read my messages. They have put a cctv in my dorm to make sure I wasn’t leaving at night (to meet my boyfriend, since, of course, dating was strictly prohibited). I wasn’t allowed to have my own personality or interest.

Love and acceptance is very conditional, I’ve only heard them being proud of me 1) when I got into med school 2) when I finished med school. And maybe when they can brag about me to the family, friends, or even strangers. But it doesn’t last long. Because I’m never enough. They now want me to continue to residency even though med school absolutely traumatized me to the point that I dissociated for the last two years, it drained my soul, I wasn’t a person.

They’re in their early 50s, both body abled, both with masters, both not working. We’ve made do for the last 10 years or so from my dad’s inheritance- that of course he had to spend a lot on my education, and are now running out. Therefore, the one who had to save up for my sister’s college is me. I’m fine with that. 

Btw, where I live, people in health care don’t get paid a lot. It barely reaches minimum wage. Just to give perspective. 

About a month ago, they managed to sell the house, and acquired a large sum of money. Naturally, I don’t need to be the one paying for bills and my sister’s college anymore, yeah? Apparently not. They also have enough money to start a business, but they don’t want to, they claim they are too old for that. 

Instead, they want to use the money to send ME to residency, so that they could brag more about their child, and I could earn enough for the whole family, and that’s their retirement plan. This is not speculation, they have actually told me this. 

Last night, they were talking about wanting to eat in a fancy restaurant, but they don’t want to pay for it themselves, they want me to pay because they knew I just got my salary. Mind you, that would cost 1/6th of my salary, and there’s not even any special occasion, they just want to. I said no because I want to save up. My ndad completely blew up saying I was disrespectful, that I should have given nmom a monthly allowance, even all of my salary. He says me buying food for the family “sometimes” here and there doesn’t count, that my coffee costs more than that. He says the parents should be my priority not myself. He brings up religion saying that money doesn’t come from hard work but from giving to your parents. He says why do you need to save up? You don’t even want to continue school. Nmom says why do you need to save up? If you die tomorrow who’s gonna use it? What the fuck kind of logic is that? They say I don’t pay for accomodation and food, and I don’t have a spouse yet. So all of my money should be theirs.

*Deep breaths*

I am a very calculated person. To avoid situations like this I control my actions and even words very carefully around them, I learned masking without knowing what it was, and I’m very good at it, too. But I am human and I get tired. I am high functioning but I also have chronic severe depression. Yesterday was a final straw. 

I went back to my room, held a scissor in my hand and put it against my neck. I did not want to be here anymore. I don’t actually want to die… so I didn’t do anything. I just want to disappear.

Also, today they act like nothing happened.

I am planning to go NC, but it’s really not as easy as it seems. I can’t just run away to some city and cut them off- they have military and police connections, they can track me. I also need money. 

Anyone reading this… I’m not crazy, right? What I do with my money, is my decision right? Their gaslighting is very hard to fight when it’s both inside my head and externally.

Hey all,

I’m a bearded and tattooed 39 year old guy that is pretty bored and lonely.  I have a family but I can’t help but feel empty I guess. Let’s fix it.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes work sends me places so maybe we can meet if I end up near you. I play music badly, write songs that I sing over this bad music. Well, kind of growl since I’m a metalhead and singing is silly. Also I can’t sing.

I’m love a good coffee and a recipe. I love sharing both. I enjoy reading probably as much as I do writing, a bit more sometimes. I enjoy a good drink. Scotch is my main one, I am pretty good at making any mixed drink. I love to bartend when people are over.

You? Want to come over for a drink? Not really, an online drink I suppose. Maybe we can talk about the above stuff. Some things I didn’t mention. Let me know you and you know me and we’ll see where it goes.

1jw4ozt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jw4ozt/friends_say_they_want_to_hang_out_but_always_bail/,"Friends say they want to hang out, but always bail. What gives?","I have a bunch of friends who I’ve met in all different places (gym, work, etc). Whenever we talk, the conversation is always great, and it seems we show genuine interest in each other as friends. There’s almost always some mention of how we should grab a coffee one day, or hang out sometime to catch up, etc. 

Here’s the problem: every time I try to schedule a hang out, these friends always BAIL! they either create an excuse (they’re too busy to hang out) or they magically are sick the day of. I try to give the benefit of the doubt, so often I’ll wait and ask again after a couple of weeks, and same thing happens. When I say “wanna grab a bite on Wednesday?” they say “I’ll have to let you know, I’ll get back to you!” And they never do. So I’ll ask again, and I’m met with “can’t do Wednesday, maybe next week?” And cycle repeats. 

What gives? None of these friends know each other. They’re so friendly with me, some even buy me little gifts, offer to pick up my kids for me, etc. like truly nice folks. My family thinks they secretly don’t like me very much and are just pretending to like me.
