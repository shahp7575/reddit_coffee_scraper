Looking for some honest feedback to consider. My brain is locked into one train of thought and I need to make sure I’m not tunnel visioned over this issue. This is a long post. I’m sorry. I just want to provide as much info as possible so I don’t have to answer too many questions in comments to create the correct picture. 

My husband and I bought a used 2019 Ford F150 XLT from a local
Ford dealership.  When I test drove it a few days prior, the CEL was on. It wasn’t blinking. The salesman was in the front passenger seat when I asked about the light. He said some work was done on the trade in and the CEL wasn’t cleared after. I asked what work was done and he didn’t know, said Service department doesn’t tell them. Before we parted ways after the test drive I pointed out the right front tire was low. I asked him to follow up with Service and update me after the test drive. He updated me the next day telling me all was good and the truck was back on the lot if we were still interested.  I test drove the truck again and the CEL was not on. 

The day of signing, we looked everything over - top, bottom, inside and out. Nothing wrong. No wet stains on the pavement from leaks. No CEL.  We really went over it well. We signed and took the truck home. All was good. I also had the car fax print out which included the service work completed when the truck was traded 3 weeks prior. No major issues, just routine maintenance including oil change, tire rotation, brakes. No mention of CEL or any major repairs that would trigger the CEL. 

15 hours later while my husband was at work a half hour away from home  in a hard to navigate busy tourist area, the CEL came on while driving. He stopped the truck, checked all he could think of including fluids and found the oil dipstick to be dry. He bought oil and it took 3 quarts to fill to max line in the dipstick. CEL light remained on. He called me, gave me details and I called the dealership. After a few calls the solution was to tow the vehicle back to the dealership and provide my husband with a loaner so he could finish the work day. I stayed with the truck at the dealership to assure I knew everything that was going on with the truck. I was not leaving without answers and I wanted to see who was talking to who when they didn’t know I was watching/listening. I was there for 4 hours. 

The service manager visited me twice to update me. While I waited I used the customer waiting area computers to do my own research. I knew the oil light would come on with low oil but not the CEL unless the oil pressure was so low there was worse damage. I’m not car/truck stupid. I won’t waste time explaining how. To say I was concerned was an understatement. We hadn’t had the truck in our possession for a full 24 hours yet. Service was able to pull the CEL history and the codes associated are P0430 & P0456, neither are associated with 3 missing quarts of oil. The codes represent a misfire, which could be the result of many things like a bad spark plug, coil pack and so on. 

Service drained all the oil, added a new oil filter and the required quarts of oil. Service manager stated he wasn’t sure why the CEL came on over 3 quarts of low oil. He thinks maybe his technician of 10 years got sidetracked when changing the oil weeks earlier and didn’t put the right amount of oil in. While I understand mistakes happen and no experienced person is above making them, had it been anymore than 3 quarts this could have been a costly mistake. 

Service manager gave us homework over the weekend, drive it, check oil when cold and report back Monday the 16th with findings and or feedback. So we did just that. I even called a family mechanic we’ve used for many years and trust. He told us what to listen for for lower and upper engine damage sounds. He also told us an existing issue that triggers a CEL doesn’t go away. Even if the CEL is cleared, a few drive sessions will eventually trigger it again. This means …. When I test drove it and saw the CEL, salesperson gave me some bs answer, it was cleared again in Service without fixing the problem and then sold to us. I even asked the salesperson on the day we were to come in to sign, to run the truck through service again and make sure all is good. He said he did. If that was the case how did 3 missing quarts of oil go unnoticed? Anyway, Friday and Saturday, we drove it. All checked out. Oil stayed at max level when tested cold. No CEL.  Sunday morning, oil still at max level while cold. Took it for a short drive for Sunday coffee and there it was again: the CEL light. 

Husband called off work for Monday the 16th and we will be at the dealership service door at 8:30am when they open. 

Here are my questions: 

1- Were we scammed by the Ford dealership into thinking this truck was good to purchase? In our minds, if the CEL was on in your possession and your service department cleared it, surely you would know the codes and what they mean? Why clear the codes and not fix the problem? 

2- Salesman said he doesn’t have access to the service department information and they aren’t kept in the loop or  updated. Is this true? 

3- I asked for service records from this dealership when they towed the truck in. I was told I wasn’t allowed to have them. Is this true? I have the car fax report but want the internal dealership service records showing me what was really done. As the owner, am I entitled to them? This isn’t healthcare - there’s no Hippa involved. Why am I not allowed to see them? 

4- While we do have a Ford warranty on the truck, service manager said they were taking care of it and we owed nothing for any repairs since we hadn’t had the truck more than 15 hours when the truck was towed back. What if this issue is too costly to fix in their eyes and they bail on responsibility. Are we screwed? 

5- The warm fuzzy feelings about having a newer vehicle disappeared as we watched the tow truck tow it away. And all weekend we’ve had knots in our stomachs over this, loss wages and time, bad feelings and words about it all as well as the stress of anticipating what next steps are on Monday the 16th. Do we have to keep this truck? 

6- Is the dealership in the wrong for selling us a truck with known issues without disclosing them? Do we have any legal standing in this situation? We are in Michigan. In Michigan, the lemon law only applies to new (2025) vehicles only. 

Thank you to anyone providing feedback.

1nhal8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1nhal8o/commute_then_breakfast/,Commute then Breakfast,"So I work in Daycare and have to drive to work, it costs a fraction of the price of public transport and takes way less time. Problem was always rush hour traffic. I started at 8am on average if I left at 6:45am I'd arrive at 7:40, If I left at 6:50am I'd arrive at 8:05am. So every morning at 6am I'd scramble to wash, feed the cats and eat breakfast and get out by 6:45am. I'm lazy and sleepy by nature so it's hard.

Thing is the earlier I leave, the shorter my commute always is. So one day I decided, up at 6am, wash, cats out by 6:25. I arrived at 7am. I bring breakfast and spend a whole hour chilling, eating toast and fruit with a couple of cups of coffee. The stress of travel is less, I have to navigate past few cars, bus only lanes don't become bus only lanes until 7am and I'm no longer worrying am I going to be late, am I going to be late.

Better still instead of making coffee, breakfast and cramming everything in, in under 10 minutes or risk being late. I get to relax for an hour, eat a bigger breakfast, have more coffee and start work refreshed and well fed. I've been doing this 9 months now and its made a huge difference. I barely realized how badly driving to work, worrying about being late then starting a shift wore me down. Now even if its a stressful drive for whatever reason, I have time to relax and eat. By the time lunch comes round I'm no longer starving because breakfast was five hours ago instead of six.

But best of all, I get to sit on my ass and relax for 1 hour. Occasionally I have to ask the janitors to open my part of the building, but its a small price to pay.",2,1757904909.0,work,0,1.0,False

I cut my teeth on a Rancilio Silvia, and have owned my current one for 4(ish) years. I am starting to do some small events for my church and friends, where they want me to run a coffee bar. My single boiler machine just can't keep up without taking forever, so its time for me to upgrade.

I would say I am fairly experienced, from working at a coffee shop, to piddling around with my own machine for a while. Main coffees that I make at home and for friends are lattes and cappuccinos, every once in a while ill make myself an americano. I do want to stick with one group head, no reason for me to go bigger.

I love the industrial look of some machines, so I want to stick with the LELIT Biancca, Rocket Appartamento, LUCCA Solo style machines. I have also heard good things about the Profitec Pro 500. My goal is to stay under/around $2K (USD). Anyone have some of these machines, and would give me some advice on which one would do me best?

1nhajwz,https://i.redd.it/16wgq6z7t8pf1.png,Love After a Toxic Marriage | arrived at the Palo Alto headquarters before the sun had fully risen,"Chapter 1

I arrived at the Palo Alto headquarters before the sun had fully risen, my heels clicking against the polished marble floor of the empty lobby. Five years of my life had gone into this building, into Ryan's company—our company, though you'd never hear him say it. Today was everything we'd worked for: the Series B funding pitch that would either launch us into tech stardom or leave us struggling for another year.

My fingers trembled slightly as I arranged the presentation packets for the fifth time, aligning their edges with mathematical precision. Each folder contained months of my work—financial projections, market analyses, growth strategies—all meticulously prepared for the venture capitalists who held our future in their hands.

""You're here early,"" Madison's syrupy voice cut through the silence, startling me. She stood in the doorway of the conference room, a vision in pale pink, her blonde hair falling in perfect waves around her shoulders. ""Let me help you with those.""

""I've got it,"" I said, perhaps too quickly. Something in her eager smile made my stomach tighten. ""But thank you.""

She tilted her head, eyes widening with practiced innocence. ""Ryan asked me to make sure everything's perfect for the Westbrook Capital team. You know how important this is to him.""

To him. Not to us. Never to us.

""I know exactly how important it is,"" I replied, my voice steady despite the familiar ache her words triggered. ""That's why I've been preparing for three months.""

She nodded, backing away with that same saccharine smile. ""Of course. I'll just go check on the refreshments.""

I watched her leave, then turned back to my presentation slides on the laptop. Everything was in order—I'd triple-checked each number, each projection. This deal was going to happen. It had to.

By nine o'clock, the conference room hummed with anticipation. David Chen from Westbrook Capital sat at the head of the table, flanked by his team of analysts. Ryan worked the room with his trademark charm, all confident handshakes and practiced laughter.

""Let's get started,"" David announced, folding his hands on the table. ""We're eager to see what Mitchell Tech has to offer.""

Ryan nodded at me—my cue. I stood, smoothing my skirt, and began the presentation I could recite in my sleep. The words flowed easily as I outlined our company vision, our market position, our competitive advantage. The room was with me; I could feel it in the way they leaned forward, in their thoughtful nods.

And then I clicked to the next slide—the crucial financial projections that would demonstrate our path to profitability.

It wasn't there.

My heart stuttered. I clicked again. Nothing. The spreadsheets—the backbone of our entire pitch—were missing.

""Is there a problem?"" David asked, his interest visibly cooling.

""Just a small technical issue,"" I managed, frantically searching through my files. But I knew. I knew exactly what had happened. Who had happened.

Ryan's face hardened as he realized something was wrong. ""Sarah?""

""The financial projections are missing from the presentation,"" I said quietly, fighting to keep my voice level. ""But I have them here—""

""Missing?"" David's eyebrow arched. ""This is the third meeting I've had with your company where critical information was somehow 'missing.'""

The room temperature seemed to drop ten degrees. The other investors exchanged glances.

""Mr. Chen, if you'll just give me one moment—"" I began, but he was already standing, gathering his papers.

""I think we've seen enough,"" he said coldly. ""A company that can't manage its own presentation materials is hardly ready for eight-figure investments. Gentlemen?""

They filed out, Ryan's desperate attempts to salvage the meeting falling on deaf ears. When the door closed behind them, the silence was deafening.

I turned slowly to face Madison, who sat in the corner, her eyes already glistening with manufactured tears.

""What did you do?"" My voice was barely a whisper.

""I—I don't understand,"" she stammered, looking around at the gathering employees. ""I was just trying to help organize the presentation last night...""

""This is the third time,"" I said, my voice gaining strength with each word. ""The third time you've 'accidentally' sabotaged my work. The Henderson contract. The Fujikawa partnership. And now this.""

Ryan stepped between us, his face thunderous. ""That's enough, Sarah.""

""Enough?"" I stared at him in disbelief. ""We just lost our Series B funding because your assistant deleted critical files!""

""Madison was trying to help,"" he snapped, placing a protective hand on her shoulder. ""Unlike you, she doesn't make everything about herself.""

The room spun slightly. Five years of sacrifice, of swallowing my pride, of building his dream while burying mine, and this was what it had come to.

""Sarah,"" Ryan's voice cut through the office like a blade, ""you need to apologize to Madison. Now.""

Something inside me—something that had been bending for years—finally broke.

""No,"" I said, the word unfamiliar but exhilarating on my tongue. ""I quit. And Ryan? I want a divorce.""

The gasps around the room barely registered as I gathered my belongings, my hands steady for the first time that day. As I walked toward the door, I caught Madison's eye. Behind the facade of shock, I saw something else—fear. She knew what I'd just realized: her game was finally over.

Chapter 2

I stumbled through the parking garage, my vision blurred by tears I refused to let fall. The click of my heels echoed against concrete walls, matching the thundering of my heart. Five years. Five years of my life sacrificed for a man who had just publicly humiliated me to protect his mistress.

My hands shook as I fumbled with my car keys, dropping them twice before managing to unlock the door. Once inside, I gripped the steering wheel until my knuckles turned white, trying to steady my breathing. The air conditioning blasted against my face, but it couldn't cool the rage burning through my veins.

""Enough,"" I whispered to myself. ""It's finally enough.""

I reached for my phone and scrolled to a contact I hadn't called in months. Michael would be in a meeting now—he always was—but this couldn't wait. Not anymore.

He answered on the second ring. ""Sarah?""

""Pull everything,"" I said, my voice steadier than I expected. ""Every dollar you've invested in Ryan's company. Pull it all. Today.""

A beat of silence. Then, ""What happened?""

""I just quit. And I'm divorcing him."" The words felt surreal coming from my mouth, yet somehow they were the most honest thing I'd said in years.

""Thank God,"" Michael exhaled, the relief in his voice unmistakable. ""Are you okay? Where are you?""

""Parking garage. I'm fine."" I wasn't, but I would be. ""Michael, I need you to listen. This isn't just about our marriage. Ryan's been lying to everyone. His precious assistant Madison has been systematically sabotaging my work, and he's been covering for her. Today she deleted our entire financial projection section before the Westbrook Capital pitch.""

""Chen was there?"" Michael's voice sharpened. ""Jesus, Sarah.""

""Pull your investment,"" I repeated. ""Pull it now.""

""Consider it done."" The sound of typing filtered through the phone. ""I'm messaging my team as we speak. Every share we own will be liquidated by market close.""

""Thank you."" My throat tightened. ""I'm sorry I didn't listen to you about him.""

""Don't,"" Michael said firmly. ""Just tell me where you're going. You're not going back to that house, are you?""

I hadn't thought that far ahead. The idea of returning to the modern glass mansion Ryan had insisted on buying—a showpiece, not a home—made my stomach turn.

""I need to get some things first,"" I said. ""Then I'll figure it out.""

""My guest room is yours. No arguments."" His tone softened. ""Sarah, I've been waiting for this call for five years. Whatever you need, I'm here.""

After hanging up, I sat motionless, watching executives in expensive suits walk to their cars, their lives continuing as if mine hadn't just imploded. The numbness was wearing off, reality seeping in. I had no job. Soon, no husband. I'd walked away from everything I'd built.

No. Everything I'd helped him build.

Two hours later, I stood in Ryan's home office, methodically packing my personal files. The house was silent—he was probably still at the office, damage-controlling the fallout from my dramatic exit. Or comforting Madison.

I pulled open his desk drawer, searching for the external hard drive that contained backups of my work. Instead, my fingers brushed against a stack of printed emails. I shouldn't have looked. But something—instinct, perhaps—made me pull them out.

The first email was from Madison to Ryan, dated three months ago:

""Took care of the Henderson slides like you asked. She'll never know what happened. Dinner tonight to celebrate? The usual place where no one knows you're married? ;)""

My hands trembled as I flipped through more pages. Receipts for jewelry. Hotel confirmations. And multiple references to ""fixing"" my presentations.

It hadn't been accidental sabotage. It had been deliberate. Planned. Between the two of them.

I sank into Ryan's chair, the evidence spread before me like a roadmap of betrayal. All those nights I'd worked until dawn, all those weekends sacrificed, all those miscarriages I'd endured alone while he was ""at the office""—it had all been a lie.

My phone buzzed with a text from Michael: ""It's done. $4.2 million withdrawn. Ryan's stock is already dropping.""

I stared at the message, a strange calm settling over me. This wasn't the end.

It was just the beginning.

Chapter 3

The afternoon sun slanted through the windows of Verve Coffee as I waited, my fingers drumming an anxious rhythm on the ceramic mug. Three days had passed since my dramatic exit from Mitchell Tech, and the numbness was beginning to wear off, replaced by a cold, calculated fury that surprised even me.

When Chloe Evans walked in, I almost didn't recognize her. The confident executive assistant I'd known had been replaced by someone more subdued, her once-perfect posture slightly hunched as if perpetually bracing for impact. Madison's handiwork, no doubt.

""Sarah,"" she said, sliding into the seat across from me. ""I almost didn't come.""

""Thank you for taking the risk,"" I replied, pushing a latte toward her. ""I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't important.""

She wrapped her hands around the mug but didn't drink. ""Everyone's talking about how you walked out. Some people are calling it a nervous breakdown."" Her eyes met mine. ""But that's not what happened, is it?""

""No."" I leaned forward. ""Chloe, I need to know what really happened when you were fired.""

Something flickered across her face—fear, then resolve. She reached into her bag and pulled out her phone. ""I kept everything. I knew nobody would believe me otherwise.""

She slid the phone across the table. On the screen was a series of screenshots—emails, memos, all meticulously organized. I scrolled through them, my stomach clenching tighter with each swipe.

Draft emails from Madison to the board, written in my name, containing subtle errors that made me look incompetent. Calendar invitations deliberately rescheduled. Files with key data points altered.

""She did the same thing to me that she did to you,"" Chloe said quietly. ""Except I didn't have a paper trail to prove it wasn't my mistakes. And I didn't have a husband in the C-suite.""

""Ex-husband,"" I corrected automatically, still scrolling. ""How long did you collect these?""

""Six months. From the day she started working closely with Ryan."" Chloe's voice hardened. ""She's done this before, at Meridian Systems. She targets women who threaten her access to powerful men.""

I looked up sharply. ""How do you know that?""

""Because I've been doing my homework since she got me fired."" A hint of the old Chloe emerged—competent, thorough. ""There are at least three other women with stories just like ours.""

My phone buzzed with an encrypted message from Emily Vance: \*Meeting you was risky but worth it. Attached: Ryan's latest board memo. Company in freefall since you left. Missed projections by 40%. Madison blaming finance team. Three resignations yesterday.\*

I opened the attachment, scanning Ryan's desperate attempts to explain the company's sudden downturn. Without my strategic guidance, he was flailing—exactly as I'd expected.

""Thank you, Chloe,"" I said, forwarding both her evidence and Emily's memo to my secure email. ""This helps more than you know.""

She hesitated before standing. ""What are you going to do with all this?""

I smiled for the first time in days. ""Justice.""

Back in my temporary office at Michael's investment firm, I stared at my laptop screen, my finger hovering over the call button. James Parker's profile photo looked back at me—older than I remembered, his features more defined, but with the same steady gaze that had once made me feel seen in a way Ryan never had.

Before I could overthink it, I clicked.

Three rings, then his face filled my screen. The London skyline glowed behind him in the early evening light.

""Sarah."" Just my name, but the way he said it—like a prayer, like coming home—made my carefully constructed composure waver.

""James."" I swallowed hard. ""I need your help.""

Something in his expression cracked at my words, the professional veneer slipping to reveal raw emotion underneath. ""What happened?""

I told him everything—the sabotage, the betrayal, the divorce, the evidence I'd gathered. He listened without interrupting, his jaw tightening as I spoke.

""I'll be on the next flight,"" he said when I finished, already reaching for his phone. ""This isn't something we should discuss over video.""

""James, you don't have to—""

""I do."" His voice was firm. ""I've been waiting five years to be there for you, Sarah. I'm not missing my chance again.""

The call ended, and I sat back in my chair, a strange lightness spreading through my chest. For the first time since walking out of Mitchell Tech, I felt something other than rage or pain.

I felt hope.

My phone buzzed with a text from Ryan: \*We need to talk. Coming to Michael's office tomorrow. This has gone too far.\*

I smiled as I typed my reply: \*Perfect timing. I'll have company.\*

1nhajgn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/1nhajgn/unsure_of_academic_direction/,Unsure of academic direction,"hey all, this is a long one. TLDR at the bottom

Having a hard time deciding on a direction in life- I’m 22, and I work at a starbucks. I am tired of working at starbucks and I want to pursue a way of making more money. I’m currently enrolled in ASU online for free with starbucks’s free enrollment benefit. over the years i’ve talked to soooo many academic advisors and i still don’t really know what in higher education i’d like to move forward with. 

as a little background, i took a college prep class in high school, went to a semester of my community college, and went to a real on campus university for about a year. Both my parents went to universities, my dad has a bachelors in culinary arts and my mom has a masters in computer tech with a nursing minor. my mom is an immigrant and my dad is a normal white guy so the emphasis of school on my life has always been really serious. in high school i was never allowed to take art classes even though i’m an extremely artistic person, and acedemically i found myself being more math and science. i was good at chemistry, bad at biology, and pretty good at geometry but i think thats because of my teachers tbh. any time ive enrolled in universities ive always done something science related, except for when i enrolled in regular university as a political justice major, but later changed to conservation and restoration ecology, and currently im enrolled in psych. 

Honestly, i’ve never really cared about school except for the social and arts part. i don’t get acedemic validation very easy, it just doesn’t do it for me. and that hasn’t changed, i really don’t care about school i just want to make more money to enjoy more other stuff in life. I wouldnt say im very book smart, and i don’t really enjoy learning in a structured environment like school. I’m not very self motivating at all. I’m the “tried to k***** myself at 16 and didn’t plan for anything after that”person, and i’m just now realizing after being out of an abusive house for the past few years- that the future exists and you can plan for it! my old goal i’ve ever really had was to move out and be completely self reliant and safe from my family and i accomplished that when i was 18, so after that ive been riding on that high- only recently ive really understood the vertues of life and how straight up survival isn’t the only thing to live for. For everyone else the obvious answer would be to do something in art but 1- i don’t want to ruin anything artistic for myself by making it into a job and 2- maybe its just what my parents have fed me but i don’t think i could find something that would make me money- especially in this economic political climate. 
i think im too stupid to do anything in math or science, i don’t really want to be a therapist because i have a history of mental illness, and i don’t keep up with the news enough anymore to continue in social justice. i was thinking of getting into the trades but i don’t want to do a manual labor job for the next 50 years and work insane hours, and the thought of a stagnant phone call office job makes me want to rip my eyes out. Also as beautiful and important i think the roles of teachers are- especially now- i can’t see myself working with kids and teacher are really really getting the  shit end of the stick- mad respect. sales and/or making my own small business is also out of the question, it’s scary and manipulative imo- i also want a job i know AI won’t take eventually. I don’t even really care about coffee really- i like the benifits and job security i have, i’ve been working there for 4 years now and i know it so well i don’t even have to put a lot of effort into my job when i come in, i like my op lol coworkers and chatting during work but still getting everything done, i like my regulars and i like being able to make someone’s day with a free coffee and it’s absolutely no sweat off my back. i love being able to have food always when im in a tough financial pinch even if it’s just starbucks food and i love giving my friends and family coffee and discounts and free lyft rides and such, i also like that i can contribute to my 401k with a 5% match!! I do like unions, farmers, agriculture, conservation of everything- art, animals, the world, culture, music, natural medicine practices, recipes, all of it! i like to explore and research but only things im interested in 

i’ve really just been feeling shit out of luck, i don’t stick with things very well so my current thought is to work the minimum amount of hours at work possible to maintain my benefit, take out a loan to cover part of my rent and other living expenses for the time- and taking out a loan will also help my credit score during this time so my credit cards (that will probably be run up like crazy) aren’t the only things controlling my credit, and power through as much school as i can like that, i think i only have about 2ish years if im doing constant school (year round). but i’ve also heard the advise to never ever take out loans so i’m not sure. 

the reason i don’t ask my parents is because my dad is now a phone salesman for the past 25 years and works at home depot part time, and my mom was pretty successful for about 24 years but became an wxtreme binge drinker because of the stress, lost her job, and honestly- is not a very good role model. i don’t think she has advice to offer that i’d like to take. 

i don’t really have another trusted adult i look up to in my life right now that i can ask advice from so i go to the internet now. I’m wondering if anyone has any advice, anything at all. and i understand that everything ive said doesnt leave a lot of other options- there’s no amount of “just suck it up”s’ and “tough shit” i haven’t already heard, im just coming on here wondering if i really am just shit out of luck and should try to apply myself to something that might ruin an aspect of life for me because i’m forced to to it professionally. 

if i had to short form my skills and interests i would say that it takes me a while to learn things but once i do i’m very very good at it, i’m adaptable, i am good at talking to people even though im not extremely fond of it. i’m very good at multi tasking and i’d like to think i’m pretty understanding. i’m good with my hands and i’m strong- a “fix-it”, o work best in medium positions of power (i’ve been a general manager at almost every job i’ve ever had) i’m pretty committed to whatever place i work for. i also do a lot of art in my free time- i also make and hem clothes too. politically and morally- in short form- id say im a semi radical punk, bordering eco/natural punk. i’m a big connoisseur of music but i don’t play any instruments. i have before tho- im a band/choir kid. although not formally diagnosed- people would describe me as definitely somewhere on the spectrum, i like to cook and i’m moderately into health, and i like to spend a lot of time alone but not completely alone. i’m not looking for a job where i’m earning a million dollars a year with an insane work load, i’m just looking to be able to send my mom flowers and buy a sandwich without worrying if i’m gonna miss eating that week, yk? not shooting for the stars 

tldr: I’m 22, working at Starbucks, and using their free ASU tuition but I feel stuck on what direction to take. School has never really motivated me, I’ve switched majors a lot, and I don’t want to turn my art into a job or end up in something I’ll hate like sales, teaching, therapy, or decades of manual labor. I like conservation, agriculture, culture, music, and hands-on work, and I’m adaptable, good at multitasking, and usually end up in leadership roles.

In 1994, Katie Walters, the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, but then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scott, after Scottie, who is 16 going on 30. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scott are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scott, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scott comes home, and sees them kiss. Scott snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scott go dress shopping for Scott’s homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scott arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scott then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scott.

Chapter 1: Not Begging Anymore

I gave her my organ. She took my husband in return.

When Lavinia was dying, I bled for her. I thought sacrifice would make us family. Instead, it made me a fool.

Months later, weak from surgery, I walked into a clinic and froze. My husband sat beside her, his hand on hers.

“Don’t worry, Lav,” he whispered. “I’ll take care of you—and our baby.”

My scar ached. My world collapsed. The sister I saved was carrying my husband’s child!

“Erin gave me her organ,” Lavinia said, smirking. “But you gave me your love. She’ll never understand what we have, Trev.”

And she was right—I don’t. I never will.

I was grieving but clarity slapped me with the messy truth. So that afternoon, I decided to end things on my terms.

I’m done with betrayal.

I'll show them how it's done.

One word—Divorce.

I'm leaving my husband…for real!

\--

For four years, I’ve been a wife, a fool, and nothing more than his second choice.

The photo of a sonogram trembled in my hand. I was supposed to be happy—if only the baby was mine. But the harsh truth—it was Lavinia's—my stepsister and my husband's lover. I stared at it until the edges blurred, until bile threatened to rise in my throat.

He was here, in the room, watching me. Silent. Almost smug. The air between us carried everything I had tried not to see—her perfume on his shirts, his sudden late nights, the way his eyes dimmed whenever they landed on me.

I finally spoke, though my voice sounded foreign, raw.

“How long?”

Trevor didn’t flinch. His expression was flat, almost bored. “Does it matter?”

A crack opened in my chest, and still I pressed on. “Of all people, why did it have to be my stepsister?”

His smirk confirmed what I already knew. He didn’t bother denying. He didn’t even try to soften the blow. Instead, his gaze slid over me, cold and assessing.

“You’ve let yourself go,” he said, tone detached, like he was listing facts. “She’s… different. She makes me feel alive.”

The words cut deeper than if he’d shouted them. Alive. As though with me, he’d been dead.

I held his stare, refusing to let him see me unravel. Inside, my heart was clawing at my ribs, screaming to shatter, but I swallowed the sound. He would not have the satisfaction.

Once, I would have begged him to choose me. Tonight, I chose myself.

I turned, walked to the drawer, and pulled out the envelope I’d been hiding for weeks. My hand didn’t shake as I laid it on the bed.

Trevor’s brow arched. “What’s this supposed to be?”

“Your freedom,” I said, my voice steady though my chest was burning in rage. “Don’t choke on it.”

I left before he could speak again, slamming the door behind me. The echo rang through the hall like the final toll of a bell. For the first time in four years, the air filling my lungs didn’t taste like defeat. I don't deserve this kind of cruelty. I was done and so was my feelings for him.

Chapter 2: No Flinch, Just Itch

The slam of the bedroom door still echoed in my ears as I moved down the hallway. Each step felt heavier, though my chest was strangely lighter—as if setting down the divorce papers had carved a space inside me for air again.

I should have gone straight to the car. Straight out of the house that had become a mausoleum for my marriage. The walls no longer carried warmth, only shadows of what we used to be. But of course, fate had other plans. Lavinia was waiting for me. Not to comfort but to insult me in my own house. She leaned against the banister at the top of the stairs, her silk robe clinging to her body in that calculated way of hers. By the looks of it, she looked entertained.

“At last, the truth had set us free,” she said softly, almost like a condolence. “I was actually planning to tell you myself but look where the situation led us.” The sound of her voice ignited something sharp in my chest. She wasn’t even pretending to be discreet anymore.

“I hope you enjoy my leftovers, stepsis,” I snapped, glaring at her.

“Don’t look at me like that, Erin.” Her voice was honey over venom. “This is all your fault. Trevor deserves someone who excites him. You were never enough. Just accept the fact that you’re a loser.”

The words should have split me open. Maybe last week they would have. Tonight, they only forged steel in my spine. I turned to her, my voice quiet but lethal. “Then congratulations, Lavinia. I hope he'll make you and your baby happy.”

Her smirk flickered, faltered for just a beat. That was enough for me to take. I descended the stairs, my heels striking the wood like a war drum, announcing my exit. The keys in my hand felt cold, solid, real—my ticket out.

By the time I slid into the driver’s seat, the weight of betrayal and humiliation pressed down like a mountain. I gripped the wheel until my knuckles blanched, fighting the sob that burned at the back of my throat. But I didn’t let it out. Not yet. Not while they were in that house, clinging to each other like victors on stolen ground.

I started the engine. I was half-expecting Trevor would follow but he didn't. Fine. He could rot in the silence I left behind. The city blurred past, streetlights flashing like gold streaks on the windshield. For a brief, fragile moment, I thought I might breathe again.

Until I noticed the headlights in my rearview mirror. Too close. Panic crept into my nerves, scratching at the edges of my calmness. I gripped the wheel tighter as I took a sharp right into an empty side street, pulling over beneath a flickering lamp post. The following car rolled up behind me, its engine low, steady.

My breath caught into my throat. Then the door opened. And out stepped a familiar man I hadn’t seen in years. Henry—the guy I ghosted back in the day.

He approached the driver’s side, raising a hand in cautious greeting. “Erin. Don’t panic. It’s me.”

I blinked, stunned, my heart stumbling over itself. “Henry?”

He nodded. “Yeah. Henry Silva.” His voice was calm, reassuring, the same tone he used to have when pulling me back from the edge of my storms. “I figured you’d need someone on your side tonight.”

My lips parted, but no words came. Of all the ghosts from my past, I hadn’t expected this one. I thought I had left him behind years ago, buried with the choices I never made. But here he was—my defender, the man who once knew me before I lost myself. And now, fate had delivered him back into my life on the same night I finally walked away from my good-for-nothing husband.

Chapter 3: Masculine Jeopardy

I needed air.

I needed clarity.

And more than anything, I needed a plan.

That’s how I ended up sitting across from Henry Silva in the quiet corner of a downtown restaurant. The kind of place where no one looked too closely at who you were or why you were there.

Henry hadn’t changed much. Sharp suit, sharper eyes, and that steady calm he always carried, the kind that made people trust him even when they shouldn’t. Once, years ago, I had trusted him with my heart. Now, I was trusting him with my freedom.

“I didn’t mean to scare you earlier,” Henry said, his fingers wrapped around the zarf of his coffee cup. He barely touched it yet.

“You didn’t scare me,” I murmured, though my hands still trembled faintly around the rim of my cup. “I just… wasn’t expecting you.”

He nodded, eyes catching mine. “I know. I wouldn’t expect that either. But when I saw your name on the case file… I couldn’t stay detached. I wanted to handle it myself.”

Silence fell between us, but it wasn’t heavy. It was the kind of silence that once defined us—when a glance said more than hours of conversation ever could. For a fleeting moment, I felt like the younger version of myself, the girl who used to believe love could be enough.

I wrapped my hands around the glass of water in front of me, trying to stop them from trembling. “He didn’t even deny it, Henry. He looked me in the eye and basically said I was… boring. That Lavinia makes him feel alive.”

“You did the right thing, Erin,” he said, his voice low but firm, scanning the documents I’d brought along. “Filing now protects you. The longer you wait, the more leverage Trevor gets.”

Henry’s jaw tightened. For a second, the polished lawyer facade slipped, and I caught a flash of the man I used to know—the one who hated seeing me hurt.

My throat tightened, tears pressing against the corners of my eyes. I swallowed them back, the way I always did.

“Henry…” My voice cracked before I could stop it.

“You’re not boring,” he said, more sharply than I expected. His gaze softened a beat later. “He’s trying to make you doubt yourself so you’ll back down. But you’re stronger than that.”

Stronger. The word settled in me like an anchor. I wanted to believe it. We spent the next half hour going over paperwork, strategies, and the ugly logistics of unraveling a marriage.

He was all business, but every so often, his eyes lingered a little too long, his tone softened a little too much. And then the bell over the café door jingled, and I felt the air shift before I even looked up.

Trevor.

He stood at the entrance, his expression unreadable as his gaze landed on us—on me, sitting across from Henry.The moment stretched, thick with unsaid words.

My heart raced. I hadn’t wanted him to follow me, hadn’t even cared if he noticed I was gone. But now, here he was, and the sight of Henry across from me was a truth I couldn’t hide.

And for the first time tonight, it wasn’t betrayal or humiliation that burned in Trevor’s eyes. It was jealousy.

He might have lost me tonight—but he wasn’t about to let me go without treating his wounded ego.

Chapter 4: So Rich Coming From You

Trevor’s stare cut through the café like glass, slicing straight into me. He didn’t move at first, just stood there with that self-righteous posture that used to make me think he was a man of principle.

Now I know better. That posture wasn’t about principles but control. I'm sure he didn’t have any at this point.

Henry shifted in his seat. I could feel the tension rolling off him, sharp and silent, like a storm gathering just offshore. He didn’t break eye contact with Trevor, didn’t flinch. That, more than anything, made Trevor walk toward us.

Every step echoed in my chest. He stopped at our table, his gaze flicking between us, then dropping to the open file of divorce papers on the table.

“So this is how low you’ll go,” Trevor said, his voice calm, but his jaw tight. “Running to your old flame like a wounded little girl. Pathetic move, Erin.”

My cheeks burned. Anger, shame, fury—it all tangled together. But before I could respond, Henry leaned back in his chair, utterly composed.

“Careful,” Henry said evenly, his voice carrying that lawyer’s precision. “You’re on dangerous ground speaking to her like that. Especially in public.”

Trevor’s mouth twitched, but he didn’t look at Henry again. His eyes locked on me instead.

“Did you come running to him the second you walked out? Is that how little I meant to you?” he hissed, low enough that only we could hear.

The words stung, but I held his gaze. “Don’t flatter yourself. You lost me long before tonight.”

For a moment, his mask slipped. Hurt flashed across his face, raw and unguarded. But then it twisted into something darker, uglier.

“You think he cares about you?” Trevor sneered, jabbing a finger at Henry. “He’s using you, Erin. He always did. You were just too blind to see it.”

Henry’s eyes narrowed, but I reached across the table first, resting my hand over Henry’s. It wasn’t calculated. It wasn’t even entirely intentional. But the second I did it, Trevor’s eyes flared with something primal.

Possessiveness.

It was alluring and terrifying all at once.

Henry didn’t move his hand away. He let it rest beneath mine, steady, warm, a silent show of solidarity that said more than words ever could.

“Leave, Trevor,” I whispered. My voice was low but edged with steel I hadn’t heard from myself in years. “Go back to your mistress. Or better yet, crawl back into whatever hole you crawled out of when you decided I wasn’t enough.”

The vein in his temple pulsed. He leaned closer, his voice razor-thin. “You’re going to regret this, Erin. Both of you.”

“I’ll see you in court,” I said coldly, eyes still locked on him. “Don’t think for a second you’re walking away clean, Mr. Larusso.”

He gave me a hard look. For a second, I thought he was going to rebut. Yet, he left, the door slamming shut behind him.

Chapter 5: Granted Versus Chaos

The courtroom smelled faintly of wood polish and old books, a place where lives were dismantled and rebuilt on paper. My palms were slick against the table, though I forced myself to sit upright, shoulders squared. Across from me, Trevor sat in his pressed navy suit, calm, smug, as though he had already won something I hadn’t yet realized I’d lost.

Henry leaned close, his voice steady. “Stay calm. Today’s procedural. The judge has everything she needs.”

I nodded, though my chest pounded. The proceedings blurred into a haze of voices, documents, and the gavel’s echo. My mind clung only to the words that mattered.

“The court hereby grants the dissolution of marriage between Erin and Trevor Larusso.”

It was done. Just like that, the years I spent trying to save us were reduced to a ruling and a stamp. Trevor didn’t look at me. He stood swiftly, buttoning his jacket with the ease of someone who had been waiting for this day, for my erasure.

Henry gathered our papers and touched my arm lightly—a gesture that steadied me, if only for a second. But the storm wasn’t behind the oak doors. It was waiting outside. Lavinia leaned against the marble column in the courthouse hallway like she belonged there.

Her silk blouse clung to her, her lips painted a victorious shade of red. The sight of her standing there, waiting for me, was almost worse than the judge’s words.

“Congratulations,” she purred as soon as she spotted me. “You’ve officially made me Mrs. Larusso without the boring ceremony.”

I tried to step past her, but she slid into my path, her eyes glittering with malice.

“You gave me your organ once, Erin. And now—your husband.” She tilted her head, smiling sweetly. “You’re such a giver. How does it feel, watching me live the life you could never hold onto?”

Her words sliced deep, reopening wounds I thought had already scarred.

“Enjoy it while it lasts,” I said quietly, though my voice carried steel. “Because everything Trevor touches eventually falls apart.”

Her expression darkened. Then, before I could brace myself, her hand struck my cheek with a sharp crack. Heat blossomed instantly across my skin, humiliation burning hotter than the sting.

The hallway fell silent, onlookers freezing in shock. And then—her performance shifted.

Lavinia exhaled sharply, her hand flying to her stomach.

Her face twisted, pale now instead of triumphant. “Trevor!” she cried, her voice breaking into a sob. “She’s stressing me—my tummy’s rumbling weird. I guess…something’s wrong—”

Her knees buckled, her body folding slightly as if the very weight of her cruelty had turned on her.

Trevor had just emerged from the courtroom, his gaze snapping to the sight of Lavinia clinging to the marble column, trembling.

For a split second, I thought it was another act. A manipulative ploy. But then—

The dark bloom of blood appeared, staining the pale fabric of her skirt. Murmurs erupted through the hallway.

“Trevor!” Lavinia’s voice cracked into a scream. “Help me—please—”

My breath caught in my throat. Even in her cruelty, even in her victory, she was still carrying his child.

Trevor’s composure shattered. His face drained of color as he rushed toward her, catching her before she collapsed fully.

Around us, chaos erupted—shouts for help, hurried footsteps, the echo of someone calling for an ambulance.

“If something happens to her and the baby, I swear, I'll never forgive you, Erin!” Trevor hissed as he boarded into the ambulance.

Chapter 6: Departure and Goodbye

The flashing lights of cameras still haunted me even hours later. Every headline had my name carved into it like a warning label—Homewrecker. Jealous First Wife. Bitter Ex.

And Lavinia knew exactly how to play the part at the press conference. She held her baby bump like it was some fragile crown. She spoke through her tears with the poise of someone trained in manipulation.

“She bullied me,” she told the sea of microphones. “Erin never accepted me, never accepted that Trevor’s heart was mine. I’m carrying his child, yet she made me feel unsafe—unwanted—just because I was his first love.”

First love. The words sliced deeper than I wanted to admit. Rage bait, exactly what the world craved. The audience burst out, social media flared alive, and by sundown, I was trending. Not because of who I was, but because of who I was painted to be.

I didn’t fight back.

The court had already granted the divorce. Legally, I was no one to Trevor anymore. And now, publicly, I was a villainess who dared to exist in the shadow of his mistress-turned-wife. So then, I booked my flight that night.

A one-way ticket.

No return.

No hesitation.

The airport was hushed at dawn. I wheeled my small luggage, wearing oversized sunglasses to shield my swollen eyes. I clutched the passport and boarding pass as though it was the last rope keeping me sane. Henry had begged me to stay, to fight. But I couldn’t hold it anymore. I was done being a punching bag for both Trevor’s betrayal and Lavinia’s cruelty.

I moved quietly, ignoring the stares from strangers who perhaps recognized me from the news.

When I reached the waiting area, my phone buzzed continuously with simultaneous messages.

Trevor: Where are you?

Trevor: Erin, answer me.

Trevor: For once, do the right thing. Apologize to Lavinia publicly. Make this right!

My chest ached, not from longing, but from the finality of it. He wanted me to bend my knees once more to the woman who stole everything.

I stared at the screen until my reflection blurred. Then I powered it off, walked to the nearest trash bin, and dropped it inside without a second thought.

But the SIM card—I slipped it out, pressing it between my fingers. When the plane ascended, I let the small chip fall from my grasp. It tumbled against the window before disappearing into nothingness, like every promise Trevor ever made me.

“You don't deserve my love, Trevor. I’m leaving you for good.” I whispered, wiping the tears in my eyes.

Just when I thought everything was in favor of me... the plane went on a drastic turbulence. And then came a loud crash! In a snap, everything exploded in my very eyes...

These are all very really issues and scenarios, but does it have to be all we talk about? There’s no positives and absolutely no in betweens. You hear the worst cases, nothing else.

I bought a CPO 2023 330i on July 13th with 17.5k miles. It’s specced exactly how I like and I got a fantastic deal. Since then, I’ve only had the car in my possession for 5 days because it’s been back at BMW service almost the whole time.

It started with some cosmetic stains inside the car. During my extended test drive I didn’t notice any mechanical issues, and the dealer told me I could bring it back later for a detail since their team had left for the day. In the few days between buying it and bringing it back in, I started noticing multiple rattles. When I dropped it off for detailing, I mentioned all of my concerns.

That’s when things snowballed. The dealership kept the car for a month. They discovered that coffee had been spilled into the center console and damaged the electronics, so they had to replace the entire MMI control unit. On top of that, they sent the car to the collision center and stripped down the back of the car to the frame to fix rattles.

When I finally got the car back, it was clean and most of the rattles were fixed, but one was still there. I brought it back later that same week. It’s now been another three and a half weeks. The last update I got was that the collision center identified the source of the problem but doesn’t know how to fix it yet and is waiting on BMW NA for guidance.

The GM has offered to unwind the deal and let me return the car given the circumstances. On one hand, I love how this car is specced and I got it for a great price. On the other hand, the stains, coffee spill, numerous rattles, certain wear and tear, and the fact that one rattle can’t be fixed so far makes me worried the car could have bigger issues down the line.

So my questions are:

Would you let them keep trying to fix it, or take the GM up on the offer to return it?

If I do return it, should I try again with another low-mileage CPO 330i (my last car was a very low mileage CPO Audi which I lemoned after just over a year over ownership), just buy a new 330i (around $54k specced how I want), or at that price point just go for a dealer gently used M340i with a few thousand miles?

I really like this car, but I’m starting to worry that if I don’t walk away now I’ll be stuck with long-term headaches. Curious what you’d do in my shoes.",1,1757904416.0,BMW,2,1.0,False

Going forwards I am going to confirm with an ent or periodontist to ensure I dont have tonsil infection or similar. that may be the source of the smell. Right now I use dial antibacterial soap and hydrogen peroxide only. Making sure to floss often but gently. This has made me able to live with it and solve 95% of the issue. Sometimes the smell still comes up but I can wear it more often.

In 1994, Katie Walters, the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, but then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scott, after Scottie, who is 16 going on 30. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scott are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scott, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scott comes home, and sees them kiss. Scott snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scott go dress shopping for Scott’s homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scott arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scott then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scott.

I had undiagnosed ADHD and went to private school which was very hard and started pulling all-nighters when I was 13. In middle school I’d wake up at 5:45ish am and get very little sleep and that continued throughout high school, and in college it was normal for me to get like 4 hours of sleep a night. I would start drinking coffee in college but it wasn’t like how I drink it (need it) now. Even when I graduated and got my first full time job, I was pulling all-nighters because I was always behind (untreated and undiagnosed ADHD), hoping that night would be the night I caught up. Anyways, at around 23, I feel like my body just gave up after being in fight or flight and I went on anti depressants for the first time and that’s when all of my sleep issues started. I thought it was just a side effect of the meds, and I’ve been in this since 2018 trying to figure this out. After trying different meds, ruling out other things, testing for sleep apnea and starting CPAP therapy and all of that, we still landed on IH a few years ago, and that’s where I’m at. (I do also have insulin resistance and PCOS, ADHD, depression/anxiety/CPTSD and all that so it’s hard to target specific things).

I do hear that some people have always had issues waking up, etc, but I’m curious if anyone ended up with IH after being severely sleep deprived for a long time. Thanks y’all 🫶🏼",1,1757903523.0,idiopathichypersomnia,0,1.0,False

He's hunched over, messing with the handle. Immediate brain reaction:

Without thinking, I full on *yell*  not even a casual ""Hey!"" but a panicked, diaphragm rom the depths shout that scared both of us. He jumps like he’s been shot, throws his hands in the air, and shouts, “I’m not stealing your car!”

I walk closer, adrenaline still pumping, and finally see what he’s actually doing.

There’s a freaking slice of cheese like a literal Kraft single  slapped right across my door handle. Just hanging out there, looking smug.

Apparently, a bunch of teenagers thought it’d be hilarious to go around “cheesing” cars overnight, and my poor neighbor was trying to clean it off for me before I left. So instead of stopping a crime, I basically accused a guy with a paper towel and good intentions of grand theft auto.

1nha43f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1nha43f/i_was_his_pregnant_blood_bag/,I Was His Pregnant Blood Bag,"Chapter 1  
  
Three years of marriage to Grant Caldwell, and I'm finally pregnant.  
  
But he just denied my maternity leave. He expects me to keep working—right up until the day I give birth.  
  
I used to think it was because he was worried. That he was afraid something might happen if I were home alone, and he wouldn't make it back in time.  
  
Then his secretary, Star Jones, got hurt. Badly. Bleeding everywhere.  
  
They dragged me in to donate blood.  
  
That's when I heard the doctor say it—voice dripping with envy: ""Ms. Jones, Mr. Caldwell truly treasures you. You have a clotting disorder and a rare blood type. He keeps a mobile blood bank ready, just for you.""  
  
My heart turned to dust.  
  
Suddenly, it all made sense.  
  
Why I was rejected after my initial interview at Caldwell Corp… only to get a callback because of my blood work.  
  
Why my leave request was denied.  
  
It was never about protecting me.  
  
It was because I have that same rare blood type.  
  
I gave up. I left the city. I walked away.  
  
But not before I saw Star's smug expression.  
  
""Grant is so overprotective,"" she purred. ""He won't even let me pour my own water. I'm not that fragile—I can protect myself for him. I don't need a blood bank.""  
  
Grant's face was tense, but his voice shook with fear. ""Don't talk like that. It's Susan Miller's honor to be your blood bank. You're infinitely more important than someone like her. Seeing you bleed… I almost lost my mind. Thank God you're okay.""  
  
He held her gently, trembling like he was cradling something priceless.  
  
Then Star laughed lightly. ""Lowly? She's carrying your child, isn't she?""  
  
Grant buried his face in her shoulder. ""If I hadn't bet that her child would have the same rare blood type… you think I'd let someone like her carry my child?""  
  
Star laughed again—bright and cruel.  
  
And I stood there, outside the door, my world crumbling.  
  
I'm pregnant. And they just took eight hundred milliliters of my blood. I nearly passed out.  
  
Not a word of concern from Grant.  
  
Not even a look.  
  
In the end, it was a nurse who took pity on me and helped me to another room.  
  
Three years ago, Grant swept into my life like a storm of affection.  
  
He paid off my father's gambling debts.  
  
On the anniversary of my mother's death, he promised her he'd take care of me forever.  
  
I really thought I'd found my soulmate.  
  
Turns out I was just a lamb raised for slaughter.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
He slipped out of the room, pulling the door shut without a sound.  
  
When he turned, he found me waiting on the bench in the hallway, my eyes fixed on him.  
  
""Susan,"" he said, a hint of surprise in his voice. ""What are you doing out here?""  
  
He came closer and knelt down, his movements calm and deliberate. His hand wrapped around mine—my skin was cold, his touch warm.  
  
I blinked slowly. ""How's Ms. Jones?"" I asked, trying to sound indifferent.  
  
Just the mention of her name softened his expression. ""Star's sleeping. But you—you look pale. You should go get some rest.""  
  
I almost laughed. He noticed I looked pale? Now?  
  
""I'm fine,"" I said flatly. ""Ms. Jones is the one who matters.""  
  
My tone must have given me away. Grant thought I was being jealous. Without another word, he pulled me to my feet and guided me firmly toward the elevator.  
  
""I'll stay with Star. The driver will take you home.""  
  
Tears stung my eyes. Without thinking, I brought a hand to my stomach.  
  
He saw the gesture. I know he did. But he said nothing.  
  
My heart felt twisted, heavy—like it was collapsing inside my chest.  
  
When I got home, the emptiness hit me right away.  
  
The house was too big, too quiet. Just Grant and me. No one else.  
  
I remembered once, months ago, when I'd just finished cleaning the whole place. I was tired, my back sore. He was working at the table, not looking up.  
  
""You're the CEO of Caldwell Corp,"" I'd joked, ""and you don't even have a housekeeper? Nobody's gonna believe that.""  
  
His reply was calm, detached. ""I don't like strangers in the house. You're my limit.""  
  
I stood there, frozen. The vacuum cleaner slipped from my hand and hit the floor with a dull thud.  
  
He must have realized how that sounded. He quickly added, ""What I mean is, no housekeeper could ever be as efficient as my wife. Besides—strangers would ruin our privacy.""  
  
Back then, his words wrapped around me like a warm lie. I believed him. I thought it meant I was special.  
  
Now I know better. I was just naive.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
His phone sat dark on the coffee table, silent and still.  
  
Moonlight washed over my face, pale and lonely in the empty living room.  
  
I wiped my tears and forced myself toward the kitchen. My body felt heavy, drained. There's a tiny blood bank growing in my belly—I knew I should eat. Grant wouldn't want his so-called ""blood bank"" to go hungry, after all.  
  
I choked down a bowl of plain noodles.  
  
Then I opened my phone. The first thing that flashed across the screen was a new post from Star Jones.  
  
To celebrate her discharge from the hospital, Grant had taken her to the most expensive restaurant in the city—The Imperial House. The bill for that single meal was probably more than I make in a year.  
  
But it wasn't the money that stung. It was the way he looked at her.  
  
The video was taken by someone else. There was Star, leaning into Grant's shoulder. He had his sleeves rolled up, serving her, feeding her bites of food. So tender. So caring. A kind of affection he never showed his own wife.  
  
I let out a bitter laugh and turned off my phone. The darkness swallowed me again.  
  
I stumbled upstairs—to Grant's studio.  
  
It was his sacred space. Off-limits to me. I always imagined it was filled with valuable things.  
  
Turns out, it was.  
  
The walls were covered with thousands of portraits of Star Jones. And the lock code? Her birthday.  
  
It opened on the second try.  
  
I wandered through the room. Grant had known Star since her school days. His early sketches were rough, unpolished, but full of feeling. As the years went by, his technique improved—but the subject never changed.  
  
Dozens of pink envelopes were piled near his easel. I opened one. Out poured Grant's desperate, passionate love. His words were so intense they brought fresh tears to my eyes. Every sentence was an ode to Star.  
  
I sank to the floor and read them all. One after another. After a while, my tears ran dry. But my heart—it felt torn open. Raw.  
  
By the time I finished, the sun was beginning to rise.  
  
I cleaned everything up, locked the door behind me, and scheduled an abortion for the following week.  
  
Once the baby is gone… so are we.  
  
  
  
Chapter 4  
  
Grant looked exhausted as he came in. ""Susan, who were you talking to?""  
  
I rubbed my tired eyes. ""You're hearing things.""  
  
He changed his shoes and pulled me into a hug. ""What's going on? Are you mad I wasn't here?""  
  
""No,"" I said, pushing him away calmly.  
  
He frowned but kept his voice soft. ""Come on, don't be like that. I heard you on the phone with a doctor. Is the baby okay?""  
  
He knelt and put a hand on my stomach, leaning close. ""Hey little one, are you giving your mom a hard time? We should go to the hospital. You're Daddy's little angel—I need you to be okay.""  
  
The performance turned my stomach. He wasn't worried about me or the baby—he was worried about losing Star's personal blood supply.  
  
""It's fine. I just need to lie down.""  
  
I pulled away and went to the bedroom.  
  
Grant watched me for a minute before leaving, apparently satisfied I wasn't in crisis.  
  
Later, he came back and sat by the bed, chatting about prenatal vitamins and doctor's visits. I smiled and nodded along. If I didn't know the truth, I might have believed he actually cared.  
  
When he thought I'd fallen asleep, he finally left. I stared at the ceiling, wide awake.  
  
He didn't come back until lunch.  
  
""Still sleeping, sleepyhead?"" he murmured before kissing my lips. ""Lunch is ready.""  
  
I pretended to stir and followed him out.  
  
But my appetite vanished the moment I saw Star sitting at the dining table. A wave of nausea hit me. I turned to leave, but Grant caught my wrist.  
  
""Susan, what's wrong?"" He frowned, glancing between me and Star.  
  
Before I could answer, Star chirped, ""Susan! You're up! I ordered your favorite nutrient meals from Imperial House—to thank you for the blood donation.""  
  
I pulled my hand free and walked slowly to the table. The spread was full of spicy food.  
  
""How thoughtful, Ms. Jones,"" I said flatly. ""You know I can't eat spicy food while pregnant, yet you ordered Sichuan.""  
  
Star's face fell instantly. Grant rushed to her side. ""Star, I'm so sorry. I was trying to accommodate Susan's tastes. You know I never eat spicy either.""  
  
Star began to cry. Grant's eyes got watery too. He spent the next several minutes comforting her while I stood there, forgotten.  
  
When her sobs finally quieted, Grant turned on me, eyes blazing. ""Susan Miller—apologize.""  
  
I clenched my fists. ""This is insane. I didn't say anything wrong. Why should I apologize?""  
  
Star burst into fresh tears. Grant couldn't take it. He slapped me—hard.  
  
I stumbled back, my back slamming into the table. My ears rang.  
  
""You brought this on yourself,"" he said coldly.  
  
From the shelter of Grant's arms, Star shot me a look of pure triumph.  
  
I stood frozen as Grant lifted her into his arms and brushed past me without another glance.  
  
Three years of love—gone, just like that.

Into: anime and K-dramas with heart (Naruto, Demon Slayer, always open to recs), story-driven movies, late-night playlists, cooking simple meals, hiking/quiet walks, stargazing, museums and cafes over parties, and a clean all-black look. I used to game a lot; now it’s Genshin once in a while. I love travel (Japan and Switzerland are top of my list), but a calm weekend at home is perfect too.

Looking to meet someone kind, steady, and emotionally open whether as a close friend or something more if it naturally clicks. Distance doesn’t matter if the effort matches.

No fancy opener needed just say hi, your age/location, and your comfort song or show. I’ll share mine back and we’ll see where it goes :)

Thanks for reading, hope that wasn’t boring. Take care!

Development? Nonexistent.
The superintendent is a maintainer who only care about meals, snacks and Monsters, and the DO is a civilian reliving his glory days like it’s still 1999. They shout about empowerment but micromanage enlisted into the ground. Civilian ADs pull the strings, and if you’re not one of their pets, you’re basically invisible.
What they claim vs. what they actually do:
“We empower instructors.” → Micromanage your every move.
“We develop leaders.” → Zero investment in you; just shut up and teach.
“We respect enlisted expertise.” → Civilians run the show and treat you like an assistant.
“We model the curriculum we teach.” → The organization is the polar opposite of the values in the course.

For three whole years, I pretended to be Ethan Parker's girlfriend—only to realize, too late, that I'd actually fallen for him.  
  
Just as I was working up the nerve to tell him I was pregnant, I overheard Brittany—the girl who'd always had it out for me—talking to him.  
  
""Thanks for faking amnesia to help me get back at Olivia,"" she said. ""One hundred pranks, and I'll go out with you.""  
  
My whole world came crashing down.  
  
I was nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game to win over Brittany—his unrequited crush.  
  
So I died in a staged plane crash.  
  
Ethan searched the wreckage like a madman until he found a single ring, engraved with the words: ""Prank 100: I bet you love me.""  
  
They say he cried until he passed out and woke up in the hospital consumed with rage toward everyone involved in the pranks.  
  
Meanwhile, I stood in the French Alps, burning my fake death certificate, a faint smile touching my lips.  
  
He faked amnesia to break my heart. I faked my death to break his.  
  
Brittany's voice, sickly sweet, drifted through the wall. ""Ethan, prank 96—success!""  
  
Ethan's reply was cold, unfamiliar. ""Having fun, Brittany?""  
  
""Getting back at Olivia for stealing your scholarship and that game design award. Duh,"" one of his buddies chimed in.  
  
""Just four more, Brittany, and Ethan's all yours!"" another voice shouted.  
  
My blood ran cold.  
  
""Ethan's a genius. Who would've thought of faking amnesia just to mess with Olivia?""  
  
""That time we made her search for her bracelet in the pouring rain… priceless! And then he gave it to Brittany!""  
  
My mom's jade bracelet. The one she gave me on her deathbed. The one Ethan ""lost"" when he moved. I'd searched for seven hours in a downpour and ended up with a 104-degree fever.  
  
""And remember her thesis defense? Ethan told her he got jumped at a bar.""  
  
They roared with laughter. ""She ran to the bar, found nothing, and ended up begging her professor not to fail her! We got it all on video.""  
  
I bit my lip until I tasted blood.  
  
I'd missed my thesis defense—a project I'd poured six months into—for nothing. I had to postpone graduation because of it.  
  
Brittany giggled. ""And that time he folded her game design—the one she'd slaved over for three nights straight—into a paper airplane. She was like a stray dog, picking up the pieces all night.""  
  
""So what's the plan for this one?"" Ethan asked.  
  
""Tell her you're in the hospital. Tell her to rush over. Then we all go party and leave her hanging!""  
  
My phone buzzed. A message from Ethan: ""City Hospital, ER. Come quickly.""  
  
I slipped away before anyone noticed.  
  
Two minutes later, he retracted the message. A pang of guilt, maybe?  
  
I played along like I'd never seen it.  
  
I already knew the truth.  
  
I'd stumbled upon a hidden folder on his phone labeled ""Game Progress,"" filled with 96 videos—one for each cruel prank.  
  
The password? Brittany's birthday: 12/24.  
  
The same day he claimed he first met me.  
  
The same Christmas Eve I waited for him in the snow for three hours while he was at Brittany's birthday party, placing a crown on her head.  
  
That night, he'd wrapped a scarf around my neck—so tender, so caring.  
  
A wave of nausea hit me. I opened his meticulously kept chat log with Brittany.  
  
""Told her I was working late. Took you to Disneyland. She waited until 3 am.""  
  
""Told her her competition time was two hours later. She ran out in her pajamas. Hilarious!""  
  
The last entry was from the night of our class reunion. Brittany had ""accidentally"" spilled scalding coffee on me. Ethan shielded me instantly.  
  
But the chat log read: ""Disgusted even to touch her. Used three bottles of sanitizer.""  
  
I called my dad. Told him I wanted to join him in Paris.  
  
He'd moved there five years ago, after Mom died. He'd always wanted me to come, to study abroad. I'd refused. I stayed for Ethan.  
  
I thought I could melt his icy heart. I forgot that melted ice leaves only bone-chilling cold.  
  
""My sweet girl,"" Dad said, his voice full of relief. ""You finally figured it out.""  
  
""Yeah,"" I choked out, tears welling.  
  
""Dad,"" I said, ""when I leave, I need you to stage a plane crash.""  
  
He didn't understand, but he agreed.  
  
A plane crash. My final gift to Ethan Parker.  
  
I deleted every photo of us. While packing, a leather-bound journal slipped out from Ethan's safe. Embossed on the cover was the phoenix logo from my game, Ashes of the Realm—the initial design I'd spent 36 sleepless nights perfecting.  
  
Ethan had printed it. The book was filled with my design drafts, meticulously collected, with notes wishing me success.  
  
Page seven held a photo of me, glasses perched on my nose, deep in code. A sticky note beside it read: ""She called the developers 'frazzled cats' today. Her revised plan is ten times better. Such an adorable genius.""  
  
He'd been there those nights I pulled all-nighters—massaging my shoulders, cooking me ramen. He'd run out at 3 am for cake just because I'd mentioned craving it. He remembered my period, always ready with hot ginger tea and heating pads.  
  
This ""love prank""? He was falling for it, too.  
  
The last page held a crumpled plane ticket stub from last Valentine's Day. His handwriting filled the margins: ""If I had to choose again, I'd still pretend to lose this ticket, trick her into staying up all night with me to revise the proposal. Brittany wanted this. Prank 72.""  
  
Rain lashed against the window. All that love, built on a lie. He might have cared, but he cared more for Brittany. I was just a tool.  
  
I scheduled an abortion.  
  
That night, Ethan came home smelling like winter. I pretended to sleep.  
  
He paused. I hadn't reacted to the prank. He must've lost face in front of Brittany and his friends. Why wasn't he pushing it?  
  
The mattress dipped. Strong arms wrapped around me.  
  
He nuzzled his face against my neck, his breath warm on my skin. ""We're having a baby, Livvy Moon.""  
  
Livvy Moon. His nickname for me. Like the moon, shining only for him. Close to my real name, Olivia. But I knew he called me ""pretentious"" behind my back. Livvy Moon was a joke. Another way to make a fool of me.  
  
I stayed silent. He didn't know about the abortion.  
  
He pulled out my pregnancy test—three little hearts drawn on it in pen. My pen. The Montblanc I'd bought him with my first paycheck. The one he carried.  
  
I didn't respond. He hugged me tighter, whispering sweet nothings. My heart stayed frozen.  
  
""I'm tired. Let's sleep.""  
  
He went quiet, obedient. ""Tomorrow, we're going to Brittany's birthday party,"" he murmured before drifting off.  
  
I lay awake all night.  
  
He built a game of amnesia; I gave him three years of my heart.  
  
I'd stage a death, and he'd spend the rest of his life regretting it.  
  
At the party, Ethan's friends surrounded me, shoving the biggest slice of cake in my face.  
  
""Ethan says he loves watching you eat sweets.""  
  
Ethan looked away, feigning disinterest.  
  
The cake tasted bitter. My stomach churned.  
  
Brittany pushed the cake closer. ""Olivia, don't be rude. It's my birthday! Unless… you're nauseated by me?""  
  
A sharp pain ripped through my abdomen.  
  
They laughed, reveling in my discomfort.  
  
I stumbled to the bathroom, violently ill. Their laughter echoed through the door. Another successful prank.  
  
""Still have that stomach bug?"" Ethan offered me a glass of water with mint leaves—an old remedy he'd taught me when we first met.  
  
I couldn't answer. The pain intensified—needles stabbing my insides.  
  
I looked down. Blood. So much blood.  
  
""Take me to the hospital,"" I whispered, clutching his arm.  
  
Brittany blocked the door, giggling. ""It's just spotting. Totally normal. Don't overreact, Ethan.""  
  
""Get out of the way!"" Ethan roared.  
  
The first time he'd ever challenged her.  
  
I woke up to Brittany's whiny voice outside the room. ""Too much of the… you know… stuff? Wasn't it just supposed to be embarrassing?""  
  
One of the guys laughed. ""Getting rid of that little bastard's a bonus. Ethan should be thanking us.""  
  
""Yeah. Three years is enough. What if she'd kept it? How would he ditch her then?""  
  
Ethan's voice, low and strained. ""Pranks are pranks. You don't mess with her health.""  
  
Brittany's voice turned shocked, then angry. ""Who was it that said he'd help me 'teach that nerd a lesson'? Who wanted to humiliate her as my birthday gift? Don't tell me you've fallen for her.""  
  
A long silence. Then, ""Never. You know I love you.""  
  
Laughter erupted again.  
  
Prank 98: Complete. They were already plotting number 99.  
  
I touched my now-flat stomach. The dull ache lingered. We were just part of their sick game—a birthday present for Brittany.  
  
I cancelled the abortion. There was no need.  
  
The baby's father had already made the decision.  
  
I was about to call my dad when Ethan walked in. I feigned sleep.  
  
His voice, thick with guilt, brushed against my ear. ""Olivia, I'm so sorry…""  
  
The reason went unspoken.  
  
When I was discharged, Ethan said his friends and Brittany wanted to apologize. They invited me to hike up Cheaha Mountain. There was a temple at the top, a place to pray for our lost child.  
  
I knew it was probably another prank. But the thought of the baby…  
  
This would be my goodbye.  
  
They fawned over Brittany, ignoring me.  
  
At the prayer tree, Ethan bought a wooden plaque for us to write the baby's name together.  
  
Brittany smiled sweetly. ""You're such a good mom, Olivia.""  
  
I ignored her fake sympathy.  
  
The tree was crowded. I had to lean over the railing to hang the plaque. Someone shoved me hard from behind.  
  
""Aaah!""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
A sudden, violent force ripped through me. My leg... I couldn't move.  
  
Everything went black.  
  
Then, Ethan's arms were around me, lifting me up. His eyes were red and swollen.  
  
""Livvy Moon, don't worry. I'll get you to a hospital.""  
  
""Why?"" I whispered, my vision swimming with tears. ""Why are you doing this to me?""  
  
The wound was on the outside, but my heart was the one that felt completely shattered.  
  
His voice shook. ""I didn't know they'd do that, Olivia. I swear…""  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up with my leg trapped in a heavy plaster cast. The doctor said the damage might be permanent. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks.  
  
Ethan was right there beside me, his face etched with deep worry. He drew a tiny moon on the cast. ""Livvy Moon,"" he whispered. ""I'll be here until you're better.""  
  
I closed my eyes, and he gently tucked the blanket around me, moving as if I were made of the most fragile glass. He fussed over me, fetching anything I could possibly need, running back and forth for almost an hour before he finally settled into his chair.  
  
The perfect, attentive boyfriend.  
  
The one who had orchestrated my downfall.  
  
I pretended to sleep, my heart hammering out a painful, frantic rhythm. Ethan stayed up the entire night, keeping watch over me.  
  
He kept kissing that little moon on my cast, his own tears flowing freely. He held my hand so tight, as if he were afraid I might vanish.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Livvy Moon. It's all my fault. I should've never listened to them. I should've never hurt you.""  
  
""I'm glad I still have a chance. I won't ever hurt you again. You're my everything, Livvy Moon.""  
  
""I almost lost you. I'm so sorry.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He watched me all night, and I could feel the weight of his gaze. He was in pain because I was hurt—he'd even told them not to mess with my health.  
  
For a second, I almost let my guard down. Almost. Then it hit me—how delusional I was being.  
  
Ethan's true loyalty? It always went back to Brittany.  
  
Prank 99. I was still just a pawn in their twisted game. He let it happen. Again.  
  
What's stopping him from being part of Prank 100?  
  
While he was out grabbing breakfast, I called my dad. The bodyguards were already on their way. It was time to put the ""plane crash"" plan into motion.  
  
Then Brittany showed up. Smug. Gloating.  
  
""Olivia, breaking your leg? That was my idea. Prank 99.""  
  
I stared back, my breath catching in my throat.  
  
She looked me over, adjusting her designer shawl like she owned the room.  
  
""Prank 100? The Realm competition. You're going down for plagiarism. Ethan handed over all your Ashes of the Realm levels. He even bribed the committee. Your submission will be timestamped three minutes after mine. Get ready for public humiliation.""  
  
Realm. The biggest game design competition in the country. Two years of my life—all those levels, saved on my laptop.  
  
I slapped her. Hard. ""Stealing my work. Chasing after my boyfriend. You'll always be a second-rate version of yourself, Brittany.""  
  
Her eyes turned sharp. She grabbed my wrist, hand raised to hit back. ""You're the one settling for secondhand things now!""  
  
But the slap never came.  
  
""Brittany, what the hell are you doing?"" Ethan stood in the doorway—my dad's bodyguards right behind him.

1nh9ywf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1nh9ywf/struggling_with_gaming_conflict_in_my_marriage/,Struggling with gaming conflict in my marriage,"Hi everyone, first time posting here.

I’m 29, my wife is 36, and we run a business together. We've been together for 7 years and married for 2 years. When we first got together, we both worked extremely hard to get our business off the ground. Now things are stable, we make our own schedules, client work is always handled on time, and we’ve built a lifestyle that includes a lot of travel and free time.

I’ve always been a gamer. Early in our relationship (when I was about 25), I did fall into some unhealthy habits — gaming 3–4 hours every single day. Since then, I’ve made big changes, but the topic has continued to come up on and off over the past 4 years.

Recently, after we spent a month traveling around resorts in Canada, I logged back in to play with some friends. That’s when things escalated again. A few days ago, she walked into my office while I was working and saw a game open in the background. She assumed I’d been gaming all day, and since then we’ve been fighting. Now she says I need to quit gaming completely or she’ll leave.

For context, our life together is very active and connected:

We spend about 3 hours every morning walking the dogs and having coffee together.

We both work during the day.

In the afternoons we either go to the gym for 1.5 hours or go mountain biking for 2–4 hours.

We also travel about 2-4 months a year.


In my downtime, I like to game. Typically, I’ll be logged in (not always actively playing) for around 3 hours a day, and once a week I’d play with friends for 5–8 hours. I suggested cutting it down to just Saturdays, but she feels that any gaming is childish. She’s also said my gaming was responsible for any past businesses that failed, which I don’t believe is true.

I’m not ignoring responsibilities, and I feel like I’ve been trying to compromise, but clearly this has become a major sticking point.

So my question is: how do we move forward? Is this about gaming itself, or is it a deeper compatibility issue in how we view free time and responsibility?

We are in a friend group with 3 others (21F, 22F, and 22M). Two weeks ago, B and the other guy decided they wanted to have a movie night and watch The Emoji Movie. The girls weren't super enthusiastic, but B convinced us to come by luring us with fresh-baked brownies. It takes me and the other 2 girls \~30 minutes to get to his apartment, including a 15-minute walk entirely uphill in 80-degree heat. Upon arrival, he does not have the brownies as promised. The Emoji Movie was $3.49 and he hadn't rented it yet. 

Maybe 5 minutes after we sat down, he asked all the girls to Venmo him $1 each if we wanted to watch The Emoji Movie, or we could watch some weird and very horribly-animated Christian movie with 4 reviews for free. At first, we did not think his request for $1 from each of the women was genuine, and we were kind of shocked and side-eyeing. But it became clear that he was actually requesting that we all Venmo him $1 or we would be subjected to that weird movie. Upon receiving all $3, he purchased the movie (that we really didn't want to watch anyway) and we watched it through. At no point in the movie did he have any brownies out (literally the whole reason I came, which I stated when responding to his text invite), and instead gave all the girls one bag of microwave popcorn to share, while he and the other guy drank some beer that they did not offer to us. We watched the movie and then began our trek home. 

All 3 of us girls are annoyed because we were lured with brownies that we did not get, and had to venmo a man ($1!!) for a stupid movie he wanted to watch, while the only other man there was not asked to pay (because he brought a snack that the two of them shared), all after making a long and strenuous commute to his apartment. 

We had also previously hosted him at our apartment (me and 21F are roomates) and provided alcohol and snacks, which he enjoyed, and we did not expect, request, or recieve any money from him in exchange. He also goes out regularly and buys coffee every day, so I do not think he is financially struggling. 

Am I the asshole for being annoyed at him? Would I be the asshole if I gave him a hard time for this tomorrow? Or ended our friendship over this? All 3 of the girls are very offended. For context, this is not the first time he has been kind of asshole-ish to us, and specifically to the girls. Thank you!",7,1757903034.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,8,1.0,False

The mattress dipped. Strong arms wrapped around me.  
  
He nuzzled his face against my neck, his breath warm on my skin. ""We're having a baby, Livvy Moon.""  
  
Livvy Moon. His nickname for me. Like the moon, shining only for him. Close to my real name, Olivia. But I knew he called me ""pretentious"" behind my back. Livvy Moon was a joke. Another way to make a fool of me.  
  
I stayed silent. He didn't know about the abortion.  
  
He pulled out my pregnancy test—three little hearts drawn on it in pen. My pen. The Montblanc I'd bought him with my first paycheck. The one he carried.  
  
I didn't respond. He hugged me tighter, whispering sweet nothings. My heart stayed frozen.  
  
""I'm tired. Let's sleep.""  
  
He went quiet, obedient. ""Tomorrow, we're going to Brittany's birthday party,"" he murmured before drifting off.  
  
I lay awake all night.  
  
He built a game of amnesia; I gave him three years of my heart.  
  
I'd stage a death, and he'd spend the rest of his life regretting it.  
  
At the party, Ethan's friends surrounded me, shoving the biggest slice of cake in my face.  
  
""Ethan says he loves watching you eat sweets.""  
  
Ethan looked away, feigning disinterest.  
  
The cake tasted bitter. My stomach churned.  
  
Brittany pushed the cake closer. ""Olivia, don't be rude. It's my birthday! Unless… you're nauseated by me?""  
  
A sharp pain ripped through my abdomen.  
  
They laughed, reveling in my discomfort.  
  
I stumbled to the bathroom, violently ill. Their laughter echoed through the door. Another successful prank.  
  
""Still have that stomach bug?"" Ethan offered me a glass of water with mint leaves—an old remedy he'd taught me when we first met.  
  
I couldn't answer. The pain intensified—needles stabbing my insides.  
  
I looked down. Blood. So much blood.  
  
""Take me to the hospital,"" I whispered, clutching his arm.  
  
Brittany blocked the door, giggling. ""It's just spotting. Totally normal. Don't overreact, Ethan.""  
  
""Get out of the way!"" Ethan roared.  
  
The first time he'd ever challenged her.  
  
I woke up to Brittany's whiny voice outside the room. ""Too much of the… you know… stuff? Wasn't it just supposed to be embarrassing?""  
  
One of the guys laughed. ""Getting rid of that little bastard's a bonus. Ethan should be thanking us.""  
  
""Yeah. Three years is enough. What if she'd kept it? How would he ditch her then?""  
  
Ethan's voice, low and strained. ""Pranks are pranks. You don't mess with her health.""  
  
Brittany's voice turned shocked, then angry. ""Who was it that said he'd help me 'teach that nerd a lesson'? Who wanted to humiliate her as my birthday gift? Don't tell me you've fallen for her.""  
  
A long silence. Then, ""Never. You know I love you.""  
  
Laughter erupted again.  
  
Prank 98: Complete. They were already plotting number 99.  
  
I touched my now-flat stomach. The dull ache lingered. We were just part of their sick game—a birthday present for Brittany.  
  
I cancelled the abortion. There was no need.  
  
The baby's father had already made the decision.  
  
I was about to call my dad when Ethan walked in. I feigned sleep.  
  
His voice, thick with guilt, brushed against my ear. ""Olivia, I'm so sorry…""  
  
The reason went unspoken.  
  
When I was discharged, Ethan said his friends and Brittany wanted to apologize. They invited me to hike up Cheaha Mountain. There was a temple at the top, a place to pray for our lost child.  
  
I knew it was probably another prank. But the thought of the baby…  
  
This would be my goodbye.  
  
They fawned over Brittany, ignoring me.  
  
At the prayer tree, Ethan bought a wooden plaque for us to write the baby's name together.  
  
Brittany smiled sweetly. ""You're such a good mom, Olivia.""  
  
I ignored her fake sympathy.  
  
The tree was crowded. I had to lean over the railing to hang the plaque. Someone shoved me hard from behind.  
  
""Aaah!""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
A sudden, violent force ripped through me. My leg... I couldn't move.  
  
Everything went black.  
  
Then, Ethan's arms were around me, lifting me up. His eyes were red and swollen.  
  
""Livvy Moon, don't worry. I'll get you to a hospital.""  
  
""Why?"" I whispered, my vision swimming with tears. ""Why are you doing this to me?""  
  
The wound was on the outside, but my heart was the one that felt completely shattered.  
  
His voice shook. ""I didn't know they'd do that, Olivia. I swear…""  
  
Then, nothing.  
  
I woke up with my leg trapped in a heavy plaster cast. The doctor said the damage might be permanent. Hot tears spilled down my cheeks.  
  
Ethan was right there beside me, his face etched with deep worry. He drew a tiny moon on the cast. ""Livvy Moon,"" he whispered. ""I'll be here until you're better.""  
  
I closed my eyes, and he gently tucked the blanket around me, moving as if I were made of the most fragile glass. He fussed over me, fetching anything I could possibly need, running back and forth for almost an hour before he finally settled into his chair.  
  
The perfect, attentive boyfriend.  
  
The one who had orchestrated my downfall.  
  
I pretended to sleep, my heart hammering out a painful, frantic rhythm. Ethan stayed up the entire night, keeping watch over me.  
  
He kept kissing that little moon on my cast, his own tears flowing freely. He held my hand so tight, as if he were afraid I might vanish.  
  
""I'm so sorry, Livvy Moon. It's all my fault. I should've never listened to them. I should've never hurt you.""  
  
""I'm glad I still have a chance. I won't ever hurt you again. You're my everything, Livvy Moon.""  
  
""I almost lost you. I'm so sorry.""  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He watched me all night, and I could feel the weight of his gaze. He was in pain because I was hurt—he'd even told them not to mess with my health.  
  
For a second, I almost let my guard down. Almost. Then it hit me—how delusional I was being.  
  
Ethan's true loyalty? It always went back to Brittany.  
  
Prank 99. I was still just a pawn in their twisted game. He let it happen. Again.  
  
What's stopping him from being part of Prank 100?  
  
While he was out grabbing breakfast, I called my dad. The bodyguards were already on their way. It was time to put the ""plane crash"" plan into motion.  
  
Then Brittany showed up. Smug. Gloating.  
  
""Olivia, breaking your leg? That was my idea. Prank 99.""  
  
I stared back, my breath catching in my throat.  
  
She looked me over, adjusting her designer shawl like she owned the room.  
  
""Prank 100? The Realm competition. You're going down for plagiarism. Ethan handed over all your Ashes of the Realm levels. He even bribed the committee. Your submission will be timestamped three minutes after mine. Get ready for public humiliation.""  
  
Realm. The biggest game design competition in the country. Two years of my life—all those levels, saved on my laptop.  
  
I slapped her. Hard. ""Stealing my work. Chasing after my boyfriend. You'll always be a second-rate version of yourself, Brittany.""  
  
Her eyes turned sharp. She grabbed my wrist, hand raised to hit back. ""You're the one settling for secondhand things now!""  
  
But the slap never came.  
  
""Brittany, what the hell are you doing?"" Ethan stood in the doorway—my dad's bodyguards right behind him.

1nh9vel,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1nh9vel/reusing_bottles_at_12m/,Reusing bottles at 12m+?,"I solely breastfed my baby for like 6m, then I started supplementing formula only for daycare and still breastfed outside of daycare until like 10m. After that, I was breastfeeding only morning and night (until almost 12m). So really it wasn’t until after 10m that she would have back to back feedings from a bottle…

That being said, around 10m I had looked up how long you can keep prepared formula in the fridge and it said 24 hours so I was basically using the same bottle for 24 hours and just refilling it and putting it in the fridge between feeds. Baby is now just over 12m and we’re transitioning to whole milk (currently doing half whole milk and half formula). Because of this, I was looking up what the rules are with whole milk, come to find out (from a conversation with ChatGPT) that the 24 hour rule is for formula that the baby has not tried to drink from!

So now I’m wondering if I can keep doing what I was doing since it’s never caused a problem? Currently, I fill a bottle all the way to the top at night, once she’s done I keep whatever she didn’t finish and add more milk to it, and keep it in the fridge for her morning feeding. For weekdays it’s just those two feedings but weekends I’ll use the same bottle for one more feeding during the day. Obviously my baby has never gotten sick from it and it helps with less dishes to do so I feel like it’s fine but the official regulations say not to keep it for more than an hour or two, and then when I look at other Reddit threads, they’re asking about newborns. I feel like since my baby is already pretty much a toddler, any bacteria that does form won’t bother her since she doesn’t have a sensitive stomach like a newborn does. What do you guys think???

EDIT:

Okay just wanted to say that I appreciate everyone’s responses but I’m looking for opinions about what age you think it’s okay to put an unfinished drink in the fridge for later. Like if I don’t finish a drink, I’ll put it in the fridge and drink it later that day. I don’t really drink milk by itself, but I’ve put coffee (with creamer) in the fridge and drank it later or Gatorade or whatever. So with the assumption that it’s completely fine for adults and teens and even kids to do this, I’m just wondering at what age it starts to be okay for toddlers? 9m? 12m? 18m?

Hello Reddit! Do you love romance ideas?Slow-burn romances? Hurt and comfort romances? Ohh, maybe a pregnancy romance idea? Well, I have ideas for all those categories! I'm not replacing any of my current partners or anything. I'm just posting the ideas floating around my head. Anyway, let's get to the important stuff! My name is Em, and I am a 22-year-old woman. I have been roleplaying for a long time. Like a very long time. I consider myself a novella-length writer. Which means I write around 500-2,000 words per post. I prefer to roleplay on Discord. I write exclusively in third person. I am an adult, so I will require that you are at least 22. I love chatting about our characters and sending TikToks or other stuff. Ohh, also the important part. I do enjoy smut, but I do a ratio of 80 percent story to 20 percent smut. That is not negotiable; I write for the joy of crafting a story, not to get off.



So to recap, here is what I'm looking for in a partner. Someone who is at least 22 years old. Someone who can match my length and writes exclusively in third person like I do. Someone who understands that these roles are not all smut. Someone who enjoys chatting and building friendships with their partners!Also, I understand you get busy, as I'm a college student and work full time, so if you are busy, just let me know! 

Also please use the password: Romance awaits. 



On to the roles! Now, I broke them up into categories to make it easier to understand. 
MMC is the male main character. 
FMC is the female main character. 




Pregnancy Plots:

1. The MMC is looking for a surrogate to help him start his family. Maybe his wife has passed, or maybe he is just tired of waiting for the one to come along. So he finds FCM through a surrogate agency and begins the journey to give him a family and much, much more.



2. MMC and FMC were a fling in college, and then they had a messy breakup. So she figured he wouldn't want anything to do with his special needs daughter. That is until they run into each other in a store years later. 



3. MMC and FMC work together. They actually despise each other. So much so that everyone in the office knows that. MMC pulls pranks on FMC just to piss her off. That is until FMC life falls apart. She was married, but then she found out her husband was cheating on her weeks after finding out she was pregnant. Her life falls apart. Little did she know the man she hated would be the one to help her put her life back together. 



Slow Burn plots:

1. FMC is a journalist, a reporter for a huge newspaper company. MMC is the famous person she is tasked with trying to get to agree to an interview. Fate has other plans, and the two end up in a love story fit for the times.  All the drama MMC has in the press is fabricated by FMC to save him. 



2. FMC is a world-class bull rider. When she is paralyzed in an accident. Her family hires FMC to help bring her out of her shell. The only problem is FMC hates MMC, but that slowly ebbs away. 



3. FCM is the queen of Scotland. The only child of the king and queen, she becomes queen after her mother's death. She is amazing at it, but to keep the country afloat, she must find a king. Her father arranges for her to marry the king of another country. Maybe Russia or England or something. FCM hates MMC with a passion. She wants to run the country because MMC cannot do it. So she spends her time planning to kill him. Unaware that MMC wants nothing to do with being king and would much rather study his hobbies. 



Hurt/comfort plots: 

1. MMC and FMC were best friends. They were inseparable until FMC was in a car accident after leaving MMC's party. He thinks he caused the accident, so he no longer speaks to her. That is until one day when he comes across her YouTube page that talks about her life and her love for him. 



2. FMC is homeless and injured, living in New York. She is barely surviving if she is being honest. Sure, she spends most of her money on drugs, but that's only because her leg doesn't hurt when she is high. One day she is trying to get a hot chocolate from a coffee shop while people grumble behind her. When it's not enough money, she just leaves. MMC watches the whole thing play out and decides he must help her. After all, he definitely has enough money to do so.



3. FMC has cystic fibrosis; she has made peace with dying. That is until she meets MMC, a vampire who now works at her job. He can't understand why she won't let him fix her. She can't understand why he cares enough to want to fix her. A beautiful love story is born. 



Enemies-to-lovers plots:


1 This one is truly an enemies-to-lovers idea. MMC is an awful person, a racist, a bigot, you name it. They are just awful.That is until they meet FMC, a woman who is everything they hate, but she isn't afraid to call him out on his wrongs. To change his mind. It's slow, it's ugly, and it's beautiful.



2. MMC and FMC families have hated each other for years. They don't really know why or understand it. Waking up one morning from a one-night stand, FMC is shocked to find MMC beside her. She vaguely remembers the night. The guy was smart, funny, and interested in her. Though she still hates him. This starts a very weird friendship with benefits that turns to more. 



3. FMC is a brutal serial killer. MMC is a cop tasked with getting FMC to help them catch a copycat killer. The two can barely stand each other, though in the hatred something else blooms.






Sample of my writing: 

Paige sat in the rundown, disgusting gas station bathroom. Five minutes—five minutes of pure hell. She paced the single-stall bathroom, wishing her feet didn't stick to the floor, wishing it didn't smell in here. This wasn't how she had planned it or how she had planned her life. Though everyone always said you can't plan life, Paige had found a way to make it work.

The stickiness of the floor seemed to drag her back to reality, which was somehow worse than planning to run from this problem, but she couldn't run from it. No, this was her life now as she looked at her phone again. 4 minutes and 45 seconds were left.

Paige was spiraling, probably because they were not even speaking at the moment. The fight seemed so stupid now. So small compared to this, but it wasn't that she had caught them together. In her bed, in her apartment. The memories came flooding back, no matter how much Paige tried to block them out. Her best friend had slept with her boyfriend. She supposed it was made better by the fact Adrain and slept with Jeffrey. That was something Paige couldn't give him. It wasn't another woman.

Standing in that bathroom, in the crappy, definitely haunted gas station on Seventh Street, Paige was contemplating her entire life, and the only two people she wanted to talk to were currently not speaking to her.

That was most definitely on account of her reaction, but how else was she supposed to react to walking in on that scene? Was she supposed to throw them a party? Adrain was still cheating, and the part that hurt the worst was Jeffrey's betrayal. Jeffrey was her best friend; they had grown up together. The two were inseparable from the moment Paige moved into the neighborhood at nine years old.

It was the fifth foster home in five months, the fourth couple, and the fifth month without her older brother. Justin was her everything. He raised her, but when Paige got pneumonia from the cold winter nights spent sleeping outside, Justin had to do what he could. ""I'll always love you, and the second I can, I will come get you, I promise,"" the words ran through her head as she closed her eyes for a moment.

That was nearly fifteen years ago. Fifteen years ago, that was the night a terrified nine-year-old girl met the little Jewish boy down the street, and suddenly she had a friend in this world.  
""Justin, I need you to come get me."" Paige whispered softly as she wiped her eyes. Her voice was breaking as she thought about her hero for the first time in a long time.

Justin had died five years ago, but that wound never quite healed. There was always a time in her life when Paige needed her brother. She thought Justin was more like her dad until she met Jim. Jim Goldberg was her adoptive father, and that man would do anything for Paige. Would he do this? I love her through this. Paige shook softly as she stood in the far-too-bright gas station bathroom.

The loud and obnoxious ring of the timer on her phone pulled Paige from her spiral only momentarily. The alarm going off meant she had to look and see if she was pregnant or not. The stick on the counter wrapped up in that neon pink wrap seemed to be taunting her. Maybe it was just food poisoning or the flu. Maybe she was being paranoid. God, she hoped she was being paranoid. Mumbling a prayer under her breath, Paige sighed softly as she reached forward. Her long, thin fingers shook violently as she picked up the stick.

PREGNANT.

In that moment, Paige was positive; it made her heart stop. She at least definitely stopped breathing for a moment or two. That word was taunting her. She was pregnant. Pregnant, unmarried, and very Jewish. The sound that escaped Paige's lips was a gut-wrenching noise as she stood there.

All she wanted in that moment was to call Justin and tell him she had to come get her. He wasn't going to ask why she couldn't drive herself home from a gas station. No, there would be no questions; he would simply give her a ride in silence and worry about her Jeep tomorrow.  
With shaking hands and teary eyes, Paige called the next person she could think of. ""Papa"" Paige cried as she held the phone to her ear.

Suddenly she was nine years old, again terrified of Jim's very presence in his own home. She was back in her childhood bedroom, hiding under the bed. She smiled at the memory of Jim reading bedtime stories in an empty room as Paige hid under the bed. He would end everyone with, ""Papa, loves you; it's okay. You are safe."" She needed that now more than ever.

Those work, but they’re often crowded and expensive. There are underrated growth channels that can bring in high-quality leads without huge budgets. Here’s a guide on how to use them effectively.

**1. Niche Communities**  
Find forums, Slack groups, or Reddit communities related to your agency’s focus. Engage genuinely by answering questions, sharing insights, and posting case studies. Over time, members start seeing you as a trusted expert.  
*Example:* A small design agency joined a startup Slack community and started helping founders with quick branding tips. Within two months, they converted three active members into clients.

**2. Local Partnerships**  
Connect with complementary businesses or freelancers in your area. For example, a web development agency can partner with local marketing consultants. This creates a referral network where both parties benefit.  
*Tip:* Start with free coffee or Zoom calls to discuss mutual opportunities. Build trust before discussing referrals or commissions.

**3. Client Referrals**  
A structured referral program can turn happy clients into repeat lead generators. Offer small incentives or discounts for referrals. The key is simplicity — make it easy for clients to share your service.  
*Example:* An agency offering social media management gave existing clients a free extra month for every new client referral. It resulted in a steady pipeline without spending extra on ads.

**4. Content on Niche Platforms**  
Write guest posts, guides, or case studies on niche blogs, industry publications, or specialized LinkedIn groups. This positions your agency as an expert in a specific area, attracting leads who are already interested in your services.  
*Tip:* Focus on quality and actionable insights rather than generic marketing fluff.

**5. Micro-Events or Workshops**  
Hosting webinars, workshops, or local meetups can showcase your expertise. Even small events create trust and generate leads from participants who are already interested in your services.

**Key Takeaways:**

* These channels often cost less money but require consistent effort.
* Focus on building trust and providing value before pitching your services.
* Pick 1–2 channels and commit to them for at least a few months to see measurable results.

Partner grew up in the south and we both went to school in the state so we're aware of the politics, climate differences, etc. 

ETA: we will be buying a house wherever we end up, but at a later date. Not looking at any properties this trip- just deciding if Huntsville is the place for us.",0,1757902262.0,HuntsvilleAlabama,6,0.33,False
1nh9oj1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1nh9oj1/spin_laundromat_lounge/,Spin Laundromat Lounge,"Asked my hostel for a decent laundromat at they said “Spin.”

So off I went, expecting the experience to suck because what laundromat doesn’t?

Can’t say I’ve seen one with an attached cafe.. and almost sure it was the cheapest I’ve used, though I don’t use them often.

And, free unscented detergent?  I was expecting to pay some overpriced cost for that too, so that was nice.

Coffee, a load washed, a load dried and dried my shoes in their own and I’m almost sure it was ALL less than $20.

Is this some weird unique to Portland thing?

You’d think this concept would be popular elsewhere and maybe it is, but I’ve never seen a “laundromat social lounge” until today.",141,1757902247.0,Portland,28,0.99,False
1nh9nxr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nh9nxr,Tik Tok scam dating,"I've gone through this crap before. I can clearly tell from punctuation and use of pronouns, that there's some red flags here. Random person found me on TikTok and started a conversation there. They moved to the conversation to ""Signal"" app which cant be traced and is encrypted. Their phone is ""broken"" and so they can't hear me on a phone call but it literally sounds like a soundboard is being used to say hello over and over again. The speech constantly changes from an AI generated ""AI girlfriend response"" back to very slightly broken English. 

I was sent fake photos that I was easily able to verify through Google reverse image search and I have a short video of the details. 

I confronted them about this, and new photos were sent. Can anybody verify the identity of the second set? If not I want to post it here so maybe somebody else can find it if these photos are used again. And if these photos of a real person, my hope is I can find them and let them know their identity has been stolen.

I'd like to pictures to stay up, so there's a better chance of someone else being able to find them as well.",4,1757902200.0,Sextortion,1,1.0,False
1nh9mvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nh9mvx/can_christians_have_pet_peeves/,Can Christian’s have “pet peeves”?,"I know this is a really dumb question. But I just have had experiences in my past where I can’t tell if it’s the Holy Spirit convicting me or if I’m just being hard on myself.

But can Christian’s have pet peeves? I know the Bible speaks of being patient and loving, joyful and all that jazz. And a pet peeve is something that someone finds hard to be around. 

Recently we were watching Narnia, great movie. I love it. But someone in the crowd kept talking the whole movie about “oh there’s Jesus” and snapping their fingers (as people do for quiet applause) and I just slowly found myself getting more and more frustrated to the point I just left the movie early. But now I’m wondering if I was in the wrong. I heard a little voice saying “they express their joy differently, be more understanding” but I couldn’t tell if it was Holy Spirit or myself just being legalistic. And I find throughout my life that I just have different things that set me off. Not in a blow up kind of way, but just little annoyances. People living a “comical” style of Christian life makes me annoyed. Like the people who have the “Jesus and coffee lol imma comment this entire movie about where jesus it at in it and snap my fingers in agreement and I’m just gonna be loud about Jesus in an obnoxious way”.  
I’ve always been a reserved person. I don’t show a lot of emotion, I’m not super expressive, but I’m deep. I have deep conversations and think really deeply about a lot of things. Something as simply as “can Christian’s have pet peeves” sends my head spiraling. So I guess when I see Christian’s with the “trendy” lifestyle of Christianity, my inner hipster comes out with annoyance lol.

That being said, what’s your take on this?",1,1757902117.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

Their failures are just as spectacular *(and public)* as their successes.

Think of David's amazing victory over Goliath versus his affair with Bathsheba.

Or Peter, who professed undying love for Yeshua, only to deny him three times a short while later.

Thankfully, our day-to-day behavior isn't a measure of what saves us.

Yet, despite this, we encounter the following mysterious statement from Yeshua in the Book of Revelation.

*“To the angel of the church in Laodicea write:*  
*These are the words of the Amen,*  
*the faithful and true witness,*  
*the ruler of God’s creation.*  
***I know your deeds,***  
***that you are neither cold nor hot.***  
***I wish you were either one or the other!***  
***So, because you are lukewarm***  
***—neither hot nor cold—***  
***I am about to spit you out of my mouth.***  
*You say, ‘I am rich;*   
*I have acquired wealth*   
*and do not need a thing.*   
*But you do not realize that*   
*you are wretched, pitiful,*   
*poor, blind, and naked.""*  
\-Revelation 3:14-17

Ever stop to think what our savior is trying to communicate here?

He's saying he's more accepting of those on the opposite extremes of super-cold and super-hot than those who take the wimpy, non-confrontational middle ground.

Think of David.

If there was ever a man who lived life on the edge for God, it was him.

He always ran either super-hot or super-cold.

He was a sprinter for the Lord...

Not some casual jogger carrying a bottle of Gatorade in case things got too steamy.

He was never on the fence.

See, what Yeshua was calling out is the lack of passion for his Father in heaven.

Sadly, to me, your average churchgoer fits this profile to a tee.

They are just going through the motions.

Their attention to God only takes place on Saturday or Sunday mornings when they begrudgingly wake up to go to their chosen house of worship.

Once they get there, they go through the motions of singing the worship songs, pretending to listen to the sermon with ridiculous fake smiles plastered on their faces, and afterward, greet their fellow worshippers with an equal measure of superficiality.

Probably the only thing they look forward to when they go to the worship service is the chocolate chip cookies and coffee that will be served later.

That's a chance to get some caffeine and sugar into their system to recover from the amazingly boring sermon they were just subjected to.

It's also a great chance to show off their kids and demonstrate to everyone just how socially approved by the world they are.

Ego sure loves external acknowledgement!

Then, when all is said and done, they go back home, and it's back to the porno binges.

So am I right, or am I right?

The details may slightly vary, but I think you get the gist of it.

No judgment here.

What I just wrote about was me *(outside of showing off kids because I don't have any),* and it comes directly from my personal experience.

This is what I've experienced myself, and what I've observed in others.

So if you're about to get all bent outta shape because of what I've just said...

Take a chill pill, homie...

And again, understand, I'm pointing the finger at me, just as much as I'm pointing it at you.

The takeaway for today is that the Lord hates nothing more than those who embrace a comfortable passivity that bears no fruit.

And we all know what Yeshua did to fig trees that bore no fruit.

I'm telling you, he did not mince his words when he called out the members of the Church of Laodicea.

He clearly labeled them as ***“wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.”***

So think about it.

Do you wanna face God only to hear He sees you as wretched and pitiable, all the while believing you were in His favor?

And again, I'm terrified I might fall into that category as much as the next guy.

Sometimes the lusts of this world become just too tempting and overtake me.

Alrighty, I think I've made my point, so I'll finish up here.

**CONNECTING THIS TEACHING TO THE NEW TESTAMENT**

*""Early in the morning,*  
*as Yeshua was on his way*  
*back to the city, he was hungry.*  
***Seeing a fig tree by the road,***   
***he went up to it***  
***but found nothing on it except leaves.***   
***Then he said to it,***  
***'May you never bear fruit again!'***   
***Immediately the tree withered****.""*  
\-Matthew 21:18-19

*^("")**On reaching Jerusalem,*  
***Yeshua entered the temple courts***   
***and began driving out those***   
***who were buying and selling there.***  
***He overturned the tables***   
***of the money changers and***   
***the benches of those selling doves,****and would not allow anyone to*

1nh9g6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nh9g6d/skipping_christmas_john_grisham/,Skipping Christmas – John Grisham,"Greetings, fellow readers!

I trust this message finds you well and perhaps nestled in a comfy chair with a good book in hand. Today, I'm delighted to share some thoughts on a delightful read that offers a refreshing change of pace, especially as the holidays approach: *Skipping Christmas* by John Grisham. If you're curious about diving into this charming tale, you can find it here: [Skipping Christmas – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/skipping-christmas-john-grisham/).

### A Quick Peek at the Plot (No Spoilers!)

For those accustomed to Grisham's legal thrillers, *Skipping Christmas* is a wonderful departure. This novella introduces us to Luther and Nora Krank, a suburban couple who, after their daughter leaves for a year-long Peace Corps stint, decide to do the unthinkable: skip Christmas entirely. No tree, no decorations, no parties, no presents, and certainly no Frosty the Snowman on the roof. Their plan is to ditch the holiday stress and spend their savings on a luxurious Caribbean cruise. As you might imagine, their decision sends shockwaves through their intensely festive neighborhood, leading to a hilarious and heartwarming chain of events that question the true spirit of the season.

### What Stood Out to Me

What I genuinely appreciated about this book was its sheer simplicity and heart. Grisham, known for his intricate legal plots, proves he can also craft a light, character-driven story with ease.

*   **The Characters:** Luther and Nora are incredibly relatable. Their desire to escape the commercial frenzy of Christmas is something many of us can empathize with. You'll find yourself laughing at their antics and rooting for them, even as their plans go hilariously awry. The neighbors, too, are vividly drawn and provide much of the comedic tension.
*   **The Writing Style:** Grisham's prose is as clear and engaging as ever, making it a very quick and easy read. The pacing is perfect for a novella—it moves briskly, keeping you entertained from start to finish. It’s a perfect example of how a skilled writer can adapt their voice to suit a different genre.
*   **The Humor and Heart:** This book is genuinely funny, filled with situational comedy and witty dialogue. Beyond the laughs, there's a lovely underlying message about community, tradition, and finding joy in unexpected places. It made me reflect on my own holiday rituals.

### A Few Gentle Observations

While I thoroughly enjoyed *Skipping Christmas*, it’s worth noting that it is a holiday-themed novella. If you're looking for the high stakes and suspense of a typical Grisham novel or a deep, philosophical fantasy, this isn't it. It's meant to be a light, feel-good read, and it delivers on that promise perfectly. Some might find the ending a tad predictable, but in a story like this, the journey and the humor along the way are the real treasures.

### Should You Pick It Up? My Recommendation!

Absolutely! I highly recommend *Skipping Christmas*. It’s a charming, funny, and heartwarming story that’s perfect for a cozy afternoon read.

*   **Who it’s best for:** This book is ideal for casual readers looking for a light-hearted escape, anyone who enjoys holiday fiction, or Grisham fans curious to see him in a different light. Even if your usual taste leans towards thrillers or psychological fiction, this can be a fantastic palate cleanser. It’s also a wonderful choice for reading aloud with family.

### Tips for New Readers (And Fellow Enthusiasts!)

For those just starting their reading journey or looking to make it a more regular habit, here are a few thoughts:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel pressured to pick up an epic tome. A novella like *Skipping Christmas* is a fantastic entry point because it’s a quick win. Finishing a book, even a short one, builds momentum and confidence. You can explore more of John Grisham’s varied work, or other authors, by checking resources like [Skipping Christmas – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/skipping-christmas-john-grisham/) for more titles.
2.  **Find Your Niche:** If thrillers or fantasy are your usual go-to, that’s great! Explore those genres. But don't be afraid to occasionally step outside your comfort zone, like trying a holiday humor book. You might discover a new favorite!
3.  **Read When You Can:** Life is busy, but even 15-20 minutes a day can make a difference. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee—find what works for you. Don't aim for perfection, just consistency.
4.  **It's Okay to Not Finish:** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it’s perfectly fine to set it aside. There are too many wonderful books out there to force yourself through one you're not enjoying. The goal is enjoyment, not obligation.
5.  **Talk About It!** Sharing your thoughts, like I’m doing now, makes reading a more interactive and enriching experience. You might discover new recommendations or perspectives.

I truly believe that reading is one of life's greatest pleasures, offering countless worlds to explore and perspectives to consider. Don't ever feel daunted by the sheer volume of books; just pick one that calls to you and begin your adventure.

I hope this review encourages you to consider picking up *Skipping Christmas* for a dose of holiday cheer and laughter. You can easily find it here: [Skipping Christmas – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/skipping-christmas-john-grisham/). I’d love to hear your thoughts if you've read it, or if you have any other lighthearted recommendations!

Also sorry this is gonna be so long I’m terrible at being concise but tldr, how to shoot my shot to a barista. 

Recently I developed a crush on a barista from a coffee shop I go to. My friend used to work there and I used to live closer so I used to visit there sometimes and I’ve always found him very attractive (I’ve seen him 2 or 3 times?) He has such pretty eyes and I’ve been wanting to tell him but never been able to cuz I chicken out, especially when there’s other staff there. I told my friend about it but the things my friend told me made me hesitate for shooting my shot. (Nothing major or a deal breaker but some differences such as age and religion etc.)Ofc I won’t know until I talk to him but such differences and me thinking the chance of us getting together was slim, I never pursued him. 

Until last Thursday…!!! 

It had been a while since I last visited (few months I believe). I went in with a different friend from the one who used to work there. As he was getting my order, he said “and what was your name again? You’ve been here before!”
MY HEART SKIPPED A BEAT! I didn’t think he remembered me!! I tried so hard to maintain my composure and not go full blast red tomato cheeks!!!

I tried my best flirting skills which is making strong eye contact and smiling, and yes I know it’s not much but I do have long, full and curly lashes with very unique hazel eyes that I get a lot of compliments on them so this is the best I’ve got, and it’s worked pretty well at the bars and clubs lol 

After getting our drinks and chilling there for a while, we left the cafe, and maybe 40 minutes later, we (my friend and I) went back to the cafe to borrow the bathroom. He saw us walking in, looked at me and smiled and said “Hey (my name)!! Welcome back! Round 2?” If it was just this, I would just leave feeling happy and giddy. But as I sat at the stools waiting my friend, he started talking to me! He asked me what I’ve been doing today, what I do for work, and just talking for a while, as he was taking orders and making drinks!! We laughed and the conversation ended only because I started walking over to the restroom. I rehearsed in my head how I was going to complement his eyes, but all I could do was walk over, ask him his name and got a handshake out of it lol

I have used my social media skills and found his insta but since my friend doesn’t even follow him, I didn’t follow him either. I don’t wanna seem pushy but with how I’ve been struggling with dating, I want to give this a try. I haven’t had a crush in a loooong time! I’ve been a barista and a bartender before and I know sometimes customers think we’re flirting or when they’re flirting with you it can get a bit annoying at times. I think complementing his eyes is nice, but that may not be enough to get my interest across. And when would be a good timing to go again? (I don’t think I can go next Thursday)

**🚀 Welcome to the AI Content Vault!**

I mean, who hasn't craved a treasure chest filled with proven content strategies? Imagine being able to crank out posts that resonate, engage, and, yes—you guessed it—go viral! Here are a few golden nuggets you can snag before they’re gone:

- **The “Hook ‘Em” Method:** First line bait—you know the drill! Start with a bold statement or a provocative question. Think *“You won’t believe how easy it is to double your followers!”* It's all about grabbing attention right off the bat, like a cat with a laser pointer!

- **Emotional Connection is Key:** Tap into feelings. Whether it’s joy, surprise, or outright laughter, capturing your audience’s emotions means they’ll be more likely to engage. Isn’t that why we love those feel-good stories? 😂

- **Visual Appeal:** Break up that text! Use images, GIFs, or even memes that match your vibe. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words, and memes? Well, they’re practically the new Shakespeare. 

- **People Love Lists:** Remember those listicles that got you scrolling for hours? Create content that’s easy to digest—like a delicious snack! “5 Ways AI Can Revolutionize Your Writing” or “3 Common Mistakes Every New Content Creator Makes” can be golden!

- **Add a Bit of Humor:** Don’t be afraid to sprinkle some fun in your content. A little laughter goes a long way, making your audience feel like they’re chatting with a friend over coffee (or maybe a margarita). 🍹

After nearly a year, I have an update on my situation where my boyfriend allowed his girl-friend to sleep over at this apartment. After my last few posts, things died down between the two of them. They remained friends but he set very clear boundaries after I expressed how upset I was over her being flirty with him. For example, they stopped hanging out 1x a week and, if they saw each other, kept it to a 1x month lunch or coffee or only hung out in groups. Over the course of the past year, I still had a pit in my stomach every time they hung out, interacted, or anything of that nature. I would see messages from her pop up on his phone, if we were hanging out in a group, she would make comments about his athleticism or would overly-laugh at his jokes (like more than others in the room). Anyways... he consistently gave reassurance to me that nothing was happening and she was just a ""flirty person by nature"" and he set new boundaries with her each time I raised a concern. Well.. a week ago... she finally told him that she had feelings for him this whole time. He LOST it on her. He told me immediately that he cut her off completely, and he was sorry to me that he didn't see it sooner. I know my boyfriend was blindsided and he truly thought she only viewed him as a friend, but I can't help feeling hurt that he didn't trust my gut and truly believe my concerns the whole time. Anyways, while I feel validated that my instincts were right, and I am happy at the resolution, I can't help feel disrespected by both him and the friend - who I decently got along with in group settings - as well.

I’d long forgotten about this, but I was reminded when my nephew called me, confused about why a woman would reject him just because he asked her for coffee. I sighed and just told him that, in his mind, he should thank her, so he wouldn’t have to deal with her in his life anymore.

I believe that anyone who thinks coffee dates are low-effort is under a false sense of romanticism.

Unless we’ve already known each other for some time (like friends trying to turn into lovers), first dates should only be the bare minimum. We don’t know each other. We don’t want to invest much of our finances into a connection that might fizzle out. We don’t even know if we’ll go beyond a first date.

So, getting coffee is a short, simple way to meet and talk in a safe space. Plus, isn’t it more important to make an effort to plan and show up?",2,1757900733.0,WhatMenDontSay,3,0.75,False

I was originally scheduled to come in at 10:30 am but my boss urgently texted me to come in at 8 instead because it was apparently very busy at the store, so of course I come in early! When I get there it's total pandemonium.  They have a bulk order of 8 travellers, the drive thru is insane, and we were getting mobile orders like crazy.  It was consistently busy for a good while.  

During this rush, I get a couple that wants to order a traveler and I mention to them that it may take a minimum of 15 minutes+ because we are in a rush and we are a little bit backed up.  They say sure and I place their order and I'm not able to start the traveler right away because I had to clean our funnel (it was covered in milk, creamer, stuff stuck on it) and I definitely didn't want that to get in this couple's traveler!  They had already walked away at that point so I couldn't let them know that it would take a little longer than anticipated.  

They come back maybe 10 minutes later and I let them know the coffee is still brewing into the traveler containe, but I had their cups, sugars, etc, all ready for them.  I just needed their coffee to finish.  Our machine had a bit of an issue so once again it got a bit delayed, but it was almost done brewing.  They are super irritated at me at this point and I am super apologetic but they just roll their eyes at me and told me they wouldn't have ordered if they knew it was going to take so long.  I made them aware we were backed up earlier and super busy!  

Anyway, once the traveler is done, I put everything together for them and I see them just staring absolute daggers at me as I'm rushing back and forth (mind you I'm doing other tasks and handing out other orders while this entire fiasco is happening as well) and I can definitely tell they're mad at me. 

 Once I get everything together, I fully approach the window I am suuuper apologetic and I kept telling them just how busy we were in our drive thru, and mobile orders, etc, and they just go OFF on me.  The woman yelled at me and said ""I don't CARE if you were 'backed up', you should've had it ready in 15 minutes!"" And I once again say I'm incredibly sorry.  The man then yells about how terrible I am/the store is and says ""You guys suck!"" while pointing directly at me.  

I felt like I was going to cry!  I felt so terrible.  I didn't even have a chance to try and remedy the situation because they were so mad.  I don't even know what I could've done in this situation.  My manager was super busy and so was everyone else in the store, and we had a lot of technical issues to deal with.  I ended up getting slightly teary eyed, but I didn't cry.  I definitely had to try and compose myself quickly.  

I was so distraught the entire day because we were just soooo busy the entire time!! I know this is a part of food service and customer service, but man I wish it weren't.  I know I should toughen up and be stronger too, but I am just so sensitive!! (Edit: I forgot to mention I am still incredibly new at my job, I've only been here for around a month 😭) 

Anyway, rant over.  I am so sorry for the long post and I apologize if anything was not allowed in this sub!  Please let me know and I will fix anything in my post! ",7,1757900422.0,starbucks,5,0.89,False

Hey there,

I’m looking to connect with someone genuine who enjoys good conversation, laughter, and building a real connection. Friendship is always the starting point, but I’m open to seeing where things can naturally go whether that’s just good company, something casual, or eventually more.

A little about me: I’m 33, 5’10”, athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. People would describe me as laid back, sarcastic in the best way, and always down to laugh. My work keeps me busy with odd hours, but I actually enjoy the flexibility it gives me. I can travel and usually work around different schedules pretty easily.

When it comes to interests, I’m all about the outdoors during spring, summer, and fall whether that’s hiking, camping, being out on the water, or just a long walk with good company. In the colder months I switch gears and keep it cozy with reading, cooking, binging shows, or relaxing with coffee and good conversation. I also really value physical connection and quality time. It’s my way of feeling close to someone.

I’m hoping to meet someone who’s fun, witty, playful, and open minded. Consistency matters to me, and I’d love to find someone who enjoys both the silly side of things and the deeper conversations. Someone who’s not afraid of a little sarcasm, loves to laugh, and appreciates genuine connections.

If this sounds like your vibe, send me a message. I’d be glad to get to know you.

Yotul bow \[body language\] = The use for bowing is very similar to uses in human societies. There is some regional variation, so I will only describe the form done around Areeg City. First, the tail is sweeps far to the side, until it rests against the thigh. Women sweep to the right while men sweep to the left. The chest is also bend down until it is almost horizontal, shifting the weight forward. Yotul can stand with their heels on the ground or on the balls of the feet. Smoothly during the bow the transition from the former to the latter. By balancing on the balls of the feet without the tail for support and so much weight moved forward, the Yotul is in an mechanically unstable position. Some older people do not raise their heels because of the physical demand it places on their body.

In Mainlander tradition, is said to arrive when the primordial forces are not respected and will disrupt the balance of nature, causing miscarriages, famine, floods, plagues, etc. Tallana is more common name with Islanders while Tallan is more common with Mainlanders.

Callno = Large gas-giant and only other planet is Leirn’s system. In Islander tradition, is said to be the daughter of Ralchi and Tallan and is given the epiphytes ‘the Wise’ and ‘the Wanderer’. Mainlanders did not realized Callno was not a star until late in the River Empire.

Danka = Polar moon of Leirn. In Islander tradition, is said to be the son of Ralchi and Tallan and is given the epiphytes ‘the Bold’ and ‘the Star Sailor’. Mainlanders metaphorically called Danka the child of Tallan, because it brings smaller amounts of destruction.

1 Step\^2 = 1 Sole = 144 Toe-pads

1 Tail\^2 = 1 Sweep = 4 Soles

1 Rope\^1 = 1 Field = 129,600 Swipes

I had a conversation with u/Any_Ordinary_9783 over Discord DM. He gave me permission to post the stuff below:

<Stoovas> = Native language of Yotul on Werna. In Stoovas, complex words are formed by combining simple words. I am not 100% sure, but I believe the technical term for this is an agglutinative language (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxARj07jFp0).

<Wer> \~ Cold

<Kel> \~ Sharp

<Na> \~ Rock

<Werna> \~ Cold Rock

<Kelna> \~ Sharp Rock

It is also common on Werna for families to share a suffix; Denna, Sharna, Elna, Hoona, Oona. This custom is characteristic of Islanders and deviation from it used to indicates someone as a Mainlander.

Which is the better fit?","Hi everyone! I’m in my early 30s, single, and currently in DC. I grew up in Asheville, and while DC has its perks, I’m feeling overstimulated, burned out, and ready for a slower pace and lower cost of living. DC has also felt really stuffy, pretentious, and difficult to connect with people. My job has decided to allow me to move and I’m deciding between Durham, NC and Richmond, VA and would love to hear from people who know them well.

About me and what I’m looking for:

Active (powerlifting, running, hiking). I really value access to trails, greenways, and nature.

Love artsy, eclectic neighborhoods with coffee shops, indie restaurants, and live music.

I don’t drink or party anymore, but I still enjoy dive bars, shows, and having things to do at night.

Walkability matters mainly for everyday runs and walks right outside my door, not necessarily walking to the grocery store. I use my car a lot in DC, and prefer it over the metro sometimes. I think I prefer a car city honestly. But I work from home and want to be able to go on 30 min walks or some running. 

Into concerts (indie/electronic/alternative), both big acts and smaller venues.

Work remote in tech, so I need decent airport access but mostly I’m looking for culture, community, and affordability.

My impression so far:

Durham: I’ve visited a few times for concerts. I know it’s grown a lot over the last decade and used to be rough. I remember it having a good food scene, but some people are hating on and say that there are zero sidewalks and I won’t be able to run or walk anywhere. So that worries me some. I’m afraid that I won’t like it because of of that. Some also say that the music venues are terrible, even the ones in Raleigh etc. the airport seems good, I travel a lot for work. And I do see trails and greenery but I guess it depends on where you live on if you can access that. It’s also closer to home for me drive wise so easier to visit family for the holidays or just visit for a weekend. 

Richmond: Every time I’ve visited, it feels like more of “my vibe”, artsy, historic, and a bit more established in terms of neighborhoods, food, and music. But I don’t know how it feels day-to-day as a resident. It has an airport but smaller so probably no direct flights to west coast on the occasion I do fly there. I’ve had good experiences there with food and the neighborhoods. Still further away from home. 6 hours vs 4 which does make a difference in a drive. 

What I’m hoping to figure out:
Does one city stand out as a better fit for someone like me? Could I be happy long-term in either, or does one align more with what I’m looking for (nature, artsy neighborhoods, shows, affordability, community)?

I’d love any perspectives, especially if you’ve lived in both or moved from DC to one of them!

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1.

The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation.

I’m a 24F dating my 26M boyfriend for a year now and we recently just moved in together about 3 months ago. We have also been talking about getting engaged soon. But here’s the problem. 

We have differing views on maintaining friendships with exes. I believe that exes can’t be friends, especially when there’s a new relationship involved, but he thinks it’s fine. He is friends with one of his exes and a girl named E, with whom he had a brief, unsuccessful relationship. Recently, E’s father passed away, and being the kind person he is, my boyfriend told me he plans to meet E for coffee and a conversation. He knows how I feel about him spending time with his exes, including E, and we’ve argued about this before. I’ve cried my feelings to him about this, but he doesn’t seem to understand. I trust him and know he won’t cheat on me, but I still feel uneasy whenever he mentions his exes or E. Whenever we discuss this, he says I’m insecure. I can’t stay in this relationship if my feelings aren’t being considered. Am I overreacting if I tell him I can’t be with him anymore if he continues to prioritize E over our relationship and my feelings?",9,1757899703.0,AmIOverreacting,59,0.84,False

Should I move up to 1.75 and see if my appetite goes down, or  maybe start making an effort with the quality of my diet? I’m only willing to do one or the other at this point. Not both. The other thing is I don’t drink even one ounce of water. I only drink coffee and monster so I can try drinking water, but that is a third option. I only want to do one of the three. Help me decide.

The Good Stuff First
I got this mainly because of the HydroJet mopping – it actually uses fresh water while cleaning and sucks the dirty water back up. No smeared coffee or paw prints anymore, which is huge with muddy boots and melting snow everywhere half the year. It also handles our rugs well (20,000 Pa suction + carpet detection), and the anti-tangle brush really does work with dog hair.

The Glitch
After about three months, the robot started occasionally missing spots on mopping and leaving streaks. I noticed the roller mop wasn’t spinning as consistently as before. Not a total failure, but annoying.
Contacting Support
I reached out to eufy customer service through their website. I wasn’t super optimistic—usually I expect slow replies or canned answers, especially dealing from up here.

But I was surprised:
They replied within 24 hours.
Asked a few questions (purchase date, symptoms, video of the mop head behavior).
No scripted replies—actually read what I wrote.
After a short troubleshooting round, they quickly offered a replacement roller assembly unit.
The replacement part was shipped directly to me here in Stockholm—no cost, no hassle. Took about a week to arrive (which is pretty standard for international shipping to the Nordics).
Fixed and Back to Normal
Installing the new roller was simple. Since then, it’s been running smoothly again—strong mopping performance, no streaking. Floor is consistently clean even with daily mess traffic.
Verdict

The e25 itself is solid for Nordic homes—powerful enough for carpet and hard floor, and the mopping is actually useful. But what stood out was customer service. They were responsive, practical, and solved the problem without making me chase them.
If you’re in Scandinavia or anywhere with real weather and real mess, this model’s worth a look. And it’s a plus knowing the company backs their product.

1nh8llx,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nh8llx/tragedy_with_a_smile/,Tragedy With A Smile,"You know what they say about weddings and funerals, right? They bring everyone together? What a fucking joke. I remember Uncle Derwin’s funeral as if it happened yesterday. That’s when it all began. When I lost control. We often take for granted the fact that our body is ours to move and shape to our whim. A world in which a muscle stops working or some paralysis takes hold is nearly unthinkable. At least, until it happens. Then it’s suddenly all “woe is me”, as if days earlier we weren’t making jokes about wheelchair users or stroke victims. Empathy, what a crazy concept! Anyways, I digress. I am not paralyzed nor wheelchair bound. My affliction is something a little bit more… bizarre. 

I was attending my uncle’s funeral after he had passed away in a drunk driving accident. He was the drunk driver, no surprises there. I was never particularly close to him, but my family insisted I go. My dad was especially distraught about his brother’s death. He loved Derwin, flaws and all. How someone can be so forgiving, I’ll never understand. But I can respect it. I can respect anyone who chooses to be kind out of their own free will. Especially given that sometimes it’s just so much easier to be apathetic. 

There were less than twenty people attending the service. Some of them I recognized as Derwin’s work friends. There were also a few older couples near the front pews who I didn’t know. Maybe his neighbors? He was a pretty neighborly guy, so that wasn’t out of the question. Whatever the case, enough bridges had been burned that the service was not anything huge. The circumstances of his death likely didn’t help matters. Hell, it was a closed casket for a reason. What I did notice is that no one was crying. I’d imagine that one of the most humbling afterlife experiences is to watch as no one cries at your funeral, but what do I know?

It was during my dad’s eulogy speech for Derwin that the sensation began. I had been in a cycle of frowning and having a neutral facial expression for most of the funeral, which I think is understandable. Such a dour endeavor isn’t exactly conducive to bright smiles. I was also bored out of my mind, which probably wasn’t helping. 

“He had more love in his heart than anyone I know. I think he would be happy to see all these faces here today at this service,” my dad said, tearing up. “I know he’s up there, somewhere, watching us.”

It was at this point that I noticed my facial muscles start to shift. I tried to get it under control, but they seemed to have a will of their own. I remember thinking to myself how unusual it was for a muscle cramp or spasm to have such strength. Before I could figure out what to do, it happened. A wide smile spread across my face right as my dad gave a tearful last few words. I froze. 

“And may we all cherish our time here. It’s what Derwin would’ve wanted,” my dad finished. He stared me dead in the eye, a puzzled look on his face at my expression. Then anger.

Maybe it was just him who saw me. Maybe it was the whole room. I was so shell-shocked that everything became a blur. What the fuck had just happened? And how was I supposed to explain it? Sure, the last words were touching, but not to the point that I should’ve had a grin even a comedian would be flattered by. I was too suffused with panic to even consider trying to figure out a rational explanation. My face didn’t show it, though. The grin was still wide and shit-eating. The muscles in my face were starting to ache.

As we left through the church’s open doors, my dad didn’t speak a word to me. The smile had eventually diminished once the service came to an end, but that didn’t suddenly erase what happened. The gray sky above did little to lift my mood. And if it started raining, well… safe to say I would not be having a good time. 

“Do you want me to drive?” I asked, breaking the silence. 

My dad looked at me in response with such tired eyes, I could hardly fathom it. He trembled a little, but still didn’t speak. He kept the keys to his truck clutched in an iron grip. I guess I couldn’t really blame him. As far as he was concerned, I was having the time of my life all while he grieved over his brother’s death. Maybe he thought I was high out of my mind or something like that. Sure, I had smoked some weed prior to the service, but nothing that would cause that sort of physiological response. I could only hope that the sudden smile was a fluke. A misfired nerve. Like winning the bad lottery. 

We got in the truck, silence still permeating the space. As the truck came to life, *Summer Breeze* emanated out from the speakers. My dad quickly turned the music off. He had played it on the way there to provide some levity before the funeral. It was clear to me that it was the last thing he wanted to hear right now, especially since the sun had been covered with clouds between the start and end of the service. I was so wound up inside I thought I might burst. Here was the only family left in my life, no longer willing to speak to me. And off something I had no control over. There is no worse feeling. It was like being blamed for something you didn’t do as a kid. It is utter helplessness in its purest form. 

“Why did you smile?” my dad finally asked, his voice cracking a little. There was no anger, not even disappointment. It just sounded hollow. “Is everything a joke to you?”

My heart sank. He didn’t think I was high or drunk or whatever. He thought I just plain didn’t care. It hurt. It hurt a lot. My dad always tried to see the best in everyone, Derwin being a perfect example of that. For me to shift his worldview towards the side of pessimism was beyond painful. I wanted to tell him the truth, but how was I supposed to do that when I didn’t know what the truth even was? It would just sound like I was making shit up. Making excuses. Now that was something I was good at, and unfortunately everyone knew it. It’s reasonable for one not to believe a repeated liar. I had made my bed, and here came a time where laying in it was the only option. I said the only thing I could.

“I don’t know what happened. It was not intentional, I swear.”

If I was unable to offer a solid explanation, the next best idea was to perform damage control. Out of all the relationships I was fine with fracturing, the one I had with my dad was not among them. There would be no one left to go to if I messed this up.

In my peripheral vision, I saw his face soften. “I believe you,” he said, though he still refused to look back at me. I couldn’t blame him for that. My uncanny resemblance to his brother probably did not help matters. I was a dead ringer for Derwin. Strange, the curveballs that life can throw at you even from birth. To have so little control over that is unsettling to say the least.

The drive home gave me a while to recollect myself and come up with a proper explanation. I decided I would go with the idea of it being a strange sort of muscle spasm. I would tell my dad that it was painful, even if that was a lie. In actuality, it felt euphoric when I allowed the smile to take shape. Like it was the right thing to do in some universal equation. I was rewarded for it, as though I was a dog performing a trick to receive a treat. I brushed away such thoughts, trying instead to figure out how I could word it. There was no need to further freak myself out. The funeral had already provided plenty of that. 

We eventually approached the driveway to the house. I had my own apartment, but visiting my childhood home never felt like a chore. Under these conditions, however, it was a bit of a different story. The air was laden with a tension no impromptu explanation could allay. Although what I had said earlier did have a brief placating effect, it was clear to me that my dad still wasn’t content. As he wordlessly opened the door for me to enter the house, I opted to speak up.

“I think it was a muscle spasm, but it was unlike any I’ve had before. It was extremely painful, and I’m sorry it happened at such a bad time,” I told him, my desperation making me sound incredibly genuine. 

My dad finally looked at me, sighing. “Okay. But you are right, that was really bad timing,” he said, giving me a weak smile. At least his sense of humor wasn’t completely decimated. There was still such a tiredness in his eyes that I didn’t really know what to think, but I’d take what I could get.

After that day, there was quite a while without incident. I’m not sure exactly how long, given I didn’t have the foresight to keep track, but it was long enough that the funeral became just a weird one-off. My dad was still grieving, though he didn’t hold any ill will towards me. I could thank the lord that he was more reasonable than his brother. Derwin would’ve flown off the handle had I pulled something similar at a funeral he was doing a speech for. God, maybe I miss Uncle Derwin more than I thought? I keep thinking about him even now. Maybe it’s because his funeral was the catalyst for all this. 

Whatever the case, nothing happened until a single session with a client upended my work life. I had been working as a therapist for the past two years, and was starting to get a decent list of clients. I won’t lie, it was a difficult job, with many pitfalls to look out for. I was only able to stave off burnout by building up a pretty morbid sense of humor, if that hasn’t been made clear enough by now. There’s only so much empathy and sympathy you can afford to give when constantly hearing stories of abuse, self harm, and suicidal ideation. It can weigh heavily. I was only able to stand it for as long as I did by keeping a good amount of emotional distance. Ironic, then, what would transpire next.

It was a pretty standard session. I won’t reveal too many details about the client, but I suppose it doesn’t matter much anymore. I guess I’ll give her the name “Abby” for the purposes of this retelling. She was on the younger side, and unfortunately had been through the relationship wringer. She had some PTSD from the abuse suffered at the hands of her former boyfriend. We were around three months in session-wise, so I had built up a decent rapport with her. I can’t ethically justify giving more details than that though.

Abby sat down on the plush white couch in my office as she told me of her most recent episode. I’ll spare you the minutiae, but when we came to the crux of the episode, that’s when it happened.

“When my dad raised his voice at me the other day, it was like I was back in the hotel all over again,” Abby said, starting to tear up. She shuddered a little bit, wrapping her arms around herself as though she was freezing

Even as a seasoned therapist, cases like this were never easy. To see an indelible mark left on a person from events beyond their control is harsh. Pessimism about the world becomes so much more prominent when all you see is the bad. What is therapy, if not compassion for those that the world has chosen to leave behind? Paid compassion, yes, but compassion nonetheless. Perhaps that is a cynical way of looking at it, though I did feel as if I provided genuine help to those who needed it. When it just wasn’t enough though… Well, I ought not speak on that. 

“I hate that even someone raising their voice at me is enough to do this!” Abby exclaimed, self hatred pouring forth in palpable waves. 

As I moved to respond, I felt a strange twitch. Something familiar. The muscles in my face twisting into a visage of glee. *Fuck! Not now*, I thought. I pinched my arm hard to try and keep whatever force was causing this at bay, but the pain seemed only to act as stimulus. The tugging at the sides of my lips became even stronger. I was not winning the battle, nor the war. Abby gave me a puzzled look, her tears now stopped in their tracks.

“I’m so sorry, can you give me a moment?!” I asked Abby, trying to keep my lips pursed as I spoke. 

It wasn’t enough, as a big smile broke through before I could exit the room. Her eyes widened at that, and I saw as the tears came back in full force. So much for beneficence and nonmalficence. The whole situation was fucked. I closed the door behind me with far more force than I’d intended, and I could hear Abby startle even with the separating wall. I had no more fight left in me, allowing the grin to have free reign over my face. Just like at the funeral, it felt euphoric. Again I was being rewarded. But by what?

After around five minutes, my face finally returned to neutral as though nothing had happened. I was overjoyed to have my own expressions back, but that was quickly stifled by panic. Shit, I had left a client in the room by herself! That was a big no-no, especially in the middle of a breakthrough session. That’s not even taking into account the impression I had left her with. Abby had told me some of her most dreadful feelings and I beamed at her like a kid receiving ice cream. How to unfuck this session was beyond me, but I had to at least try. 

I walked back into the room, trying not to let on how nervous I was. Distancing myself was usually easy. Not this time though, given the circumstances. Abby’s face was far more red than when I had left the room originally.

“So sorry about that, I’ve been getting these muscle spasms lately,” I said, opting to be as candid as possible. If I was to re-establish trust, that was the way to go. 

“Can we uh, reschedule for another time,” Abby responded, her voice as hollow as I’d ever heard it. “I don’t think I can do this right now.”

“Are you sure?” I asked, a vast pit opening in my stomach.

“Yes. Please.”

My heart broke a little at that moment. Whatever this spasm was, it had not only interfered with my familial life, but also my work life. Not to mention the potential damage it had wrought on the client. As much as I try to keep my emotions in check regarding my clients, I still care deeply about them. It might seem like a paradox, to both care and not care at the same time, but it exists nonetheless. Some things are unexplainable, I suppose. Abby opted to cease sessions with me after that incident. Prematurely ending treatment, and because of something I couldn’t control. It still stings. 

I took an extended vacation from work. I didn’t want to, given it left some of my more high risk clients vulnerable, but I couldn’t allow another incident like that. God forbid I smiled at someone who was telling me how suicidal they were feeling, that was a disaster waiting to happen. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if such a thing occurred. Therefore, I surmised, it was in everyone’s best interest to figure this all out. As long as this phenomena continued happening, my life was only going to get worse. I decided to visit my doctor and try not to sound like a maniac when describing it to him. 

A week later and my appointment with Dr. Kincaid came and went. It was not very helpful. He mentioned something about it being possibly psychosomatic, perhaps related to high stress situations. I guess I can understand why he came to that conclusion, given the circumstances surrounding the two incidents, but to me it didn’t make much sense. I wasn’t stressed at all during Derwin’s funeral. And my session with Abby was no more plausible, given that she was not even close to being my most stressful client. He wound up referring me to a psychiatrist, and recommended some over the counter anxiety medication. I was pretty incensed by that. I knew far more about mental health than he did, and what I suffered from wasn’t anything psychosomatic. I’ll admit in retrospect that I may have let my ego get in the way there.

It was after the visit to the doctor that the incidents picked up exponentially in frequency. The next one was while I was ordering a coffee at my local Starbucks. Not usually my first choice, but coffee is coffee. I’ll give you the short version of what occurred. 

“What kind of milk do you want with your coffee?”

“I’ll go with oat milk, please.”

“Anything else?” 

Unlike the other times where I’d had some level of warning with my muscles tensing up, this was near instant. I wasn’t able to respond because of how wide the smile was. I tried to turn around but it was as though my body was locked in place. The barista became visibly uncomfortable, shifting her feet. I was escorted out of the store after a minute of that, once my legs started to work again. The part of me that was embarrassed was far overshadowed by the terror I felt. Whatever it was, it was spreading across my body. It wasn’t just my face anymore. I rushed back to my apartment, nearly pulling a Derwin by speeding past a red light. I was lucky not to get t-boned. 

Things have only gotten worse since then. I’ve been holed up in my apartment for a while, too fearful to go out. Excuse the paranoia, but what would I do if my body locked up during a drive or something similar? I just can’t risk it, especially with the incidents becoming more frequent. It feels almost natural now when it happens. As though it's a normal function my body is meant to carry out. Moving on its own, paying no mind to the brain controlling it. What felt alien before now feels normal. I sometimes can’t tell when it’s me moving and when *it* is doing the moving. The sensations just blend together.

I find my mind wandering, foreign thoughts proliferating amongst my own. I know for the time being that these are not my own thoughts, but what will happen once it becomes as natural as the alien movements now feel? Will I be myself anymore? Will I even be able to tell?

I can’t even tell if it is me writing this all down, or if *it* is doing the writing. Looking back at previous pages, the personality expressed through the narration is not my own. I don’t have a morbid sense of humor. I don’t make jokes at times like this. Whenever my computer screen goes black, I am forced to look at my own reflection. To see a wide smile and hollow eyes staring back at me. It is a veritable hell. I’ve been experiencing an increasing urge to leave the apartment and go outside. I don’t think it is me that’s thinking this, though. I wonder what it will be like, to walk around and talk? All while the people are unaware as to what is really doing the walking and talking. 

They will see me and think: *If only I could be so happy.* They will not give a second thought to me. Or rather, to *it*. I can only pray that someone notices. Someone who knows me. Someone who can tell that I am not myself. Then again, I still don’t know if the me right now is myself. What then? In any case, there’s nothing I can do anymore. It wants me to post this. It knows no one will come to help.

Even my breathing is performed for me now. I can’t hold my breath. I can’t make it stop.

There was a time weekends disappeared with you. Hours gone between quick check-ins that somehow turned into all-night calls. I can’t even remember when it shifted, only that it felt like there was never enough time, even when you took up every part of my day and I yours.

I don’t miss the big things as much. Not the trips, not the anniversaries, not the pictures that made it look like we had it all figured out. I miss the *ordinary*.

The invisible hours where love lived without anyone noticing.

I miss you handing me my coffee already stirred because you knew the sound of the spoon made me flinch.

I miss how you smiled when I knew the difference between silence that was heavy and silence that was holy. How proud you were that I never confused the two with us.

I miss the way our laughter didn’t need an audience, didn’t even need a reason;  just you and me in a world no one else could understand.

Love isn’t what people make it out to be. It’s not the drama. It’s the safety. No one warned me that the rarest gift would be being allowed to show up messy, unpolished, undone, and not be made to feel like too much.

With you, even the mundane became sacred. With you, I was safe.

And that’s the ghost I carry. Not losing *love* in the movie sense, but losing the one place I could be wholly myself without performing, without proving.

If you ever wonder what you gave me, it wasn’t passion or spectacle. It was rarer: you were a home I didn’t know how badly I needed. And homes like that… you don’t just walk away from.

You don’t just “get over.” I know I never will. And honestly, I don’t want to.",3,1757899017.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.72,False

Now back to the s*icide attempt…. I thought it was going to work so I maxed out a few credit cards prior that I’m still paying off, my car is on its last legs and… I live in it 🫠 hence why I work in coffee shops/library

It’s so interesting how these guys that ask me out seem disappointed but they literally have no clue how much they just got saved from a disaster of a person entering their life lol.

And people are always like “let them decide for themselves” which I think is crazy. Very obviously anyone under the sun could do better. I’m not even going to put someone in the situation ",1,1757898884.0,offmychest,7,1.0,False

On Saturday I saw people kayaking near the spot in the photo (dropped pin is close to Morris Canal Park). I looked it up on Google Maps and found Urban Paddle Kayak, but it seems a bit far from where I actually saw people in the water. Does anyone know how I can kayak closer to that area?

1nh8h6h,https://i.redd.it/0e8ppntbb8pf1.png,Keto Banana Bread Recipe,"#  Keto Banana Bread (That Won’t Kick You Out of Ketosis)

Banana bread has always been the “comfort sweater” of the baking world — warm, soft, and perfect with a cup of coffee. But traditional recipes are carb bombs thanks to all that flour and sugar… and the bananas themselves.

This **Keto Banana Bread** keeps the flavor but skips the sugar spikes. By swapping real bananas for a clever combo of **banana extract** and **unsweetened pumpkin puree**, we slash carbs while keeping that moist, rich texture.

#  The Funny Origin of Banana Bread

Banana bread rose to fame in the 1930s, right when baking soda and baking powder became household staples. Legend has it that thrifty Depression-era homemakers didn’t want to waste overripe bananas, so they mashed them into quick bread.

Our keto twist? Imagine one of those 1930s bakers staring at a ripe banana and thinking, “I’d rather keep my carbs for whiskey.” We’ve honored her spirit — all the banana bread taste, none of the sugar crash.

#  Ingredients & Why They’re Here

**Cooking spray** – Keeps your bread from clinging to the pan like a toddler to their favorite blanket. Any neutral, keto-friendly spray works.

**4 large eggs (room temperature)** – Eggs give structure, bind ingredients, and provide protein and healthy fats. In keto baking, they’re essential for volume since we’re skipping gluten.

**1/2 cup almond butter** – Adds richness, healthy monounsaturated fats, and helps bind the bread without extra flour. Plus, it makes every bite more satisfying.

**2 Tbsp. melted coconut oil** – Moisture + subtle tropical flavor. Coconut oil is keto-approved and helps extend shelf life naturally.

**1 tsp. vanilla extract** – Enhances sweetness perception without adding sugar.

**1 tsp. banana extract** – All the banana flavor, almost none of the carbs.

**1/2 cup** [**Keystone Pantry Allulose**](https://langschocolates.com/product/keystone-pantry-allulose-2lb-bag/) – Our secret weapon sweetener. Allulose tastes and bakes like sugar but has virtually no impact on blood sugar.

**1/2 cup unsweetened pumpkin puree** – Replaces mashed bananas for moisture, fiber, and subtle sweetness — all with minimal carbs.

**1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp. coconut flour** – Absorbs moisture and gives body to the bread. Low in carbs, high in fiber.

**2 tsp. cinnamon + 1/2 tsp. nutmeg** – Warm spices that give banana bread its signature cozy flavor.

**1 tsp. baking powder + 1 tsp. baking soda** – Our leavening dream team, ensuring lift and a tender crumb.

**1/4 tsp. salt** – Balances sweetness and enhances flavor.

#  Instructions

1. **Preheat** oven to 350°F. Grease a loaf pan with cooking spray.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, almond butter, coconut oil, vanilla, banana extract, pumpkin puree, and allulose until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together coconut flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
4. Gradually fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture until just combined.
5. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan, smoothing the top.
6. **Bake** for 45–55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out mostly clean.
7. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Store covered in an airtight container for up to 5 days in the fridge.

Hey folks! My girlfriend and I will be in Thailand Dec 16 – Jan 9. We’ve booked:
	•	Bangkok: Dec 16–18
	•	Chiang Mai: Dec 18–24

From Dec 24 – Jan 4 we want to head to the islands. We’re trying to keep it relaxing and low-key (not into big party scenes), with time to snorkel, learn to scuba dive, read by a pool, and have beach + restaurants within walking distance.

What we’re hoping you can help with
	1.	How many islands would you do in ~11 days (Dec 24–Jan 4)? 1 base? 2? 3 is too rushed?
	2.	Which islands fit “chill, scenic, swimmable beaches, beginner diving, good food”?
	3.	Exactly where to stay on those islands (neighborhoods/areas that are quiet but not isolated).
	4.	Logistics: best way to get from Chiang Mai (Dec 24) to the islands, and then from the islands back toward Bangkok by Jan 4/5.

Our vibe / non-negotiables
	•	Low-key > nightlife; don’t care about Full Moon or clubs
	•	Walkable to beach, coffee, dinners (we don’t want to scooter every single trip)
	•	Nice pool at the hotel/guesthouse
	•	Beginner-friendly scuba course (Open Water) + easy snorkel access
	•	We’ll carry normal luggage (not ultra-backpack minimalists)
	•	Totally fine booking domestic flights + ferries if it saves time

Shortlists we’re considering (please roast/help refine!)

Option A — Andaman side (seems drier late Dec?):
	•	Koh Lanta (Klong Dao/Long Beach for mellow + restaurants?)
	•	Koh Yao Noi (super chill, views, day trips to Phang Nga)
	•	Railay/Ao Nang (beautiful but is it too busy over NYE?)
	•	Phuket but only quiet corners (e.g., Nai Harn/Bang Tao) if they’re actually low-key in peak season

Option B — Gulf side:
	•	Koh Tao (learn to dive but what’s the holiday crowd like?)
	•	Koh Phangan (Skip party zones; how’s the north/northeast for quiet?)
	•	Koh Samui (which beaches stay relaxed + walkable over the holidays?)

If you had 11 nights, would you:
• Do one base (max chill, day-trips)?
• Do two bases (e.g., 6 nights + 5 nights)?
• Try three (or is that just packing/ferry chaos at peak time)?

Logistics questions
	•	Dec 24 (from Chiang Mai): would you fly to Krabi / Phuket (for Andaman) or Surat Thani / Samui (for Gulf)? Which has the smoothest connections to your recommended island(s) that day?
	•	Ferry transfers around Dec 27 – Jan 2: how crazy are lines/capacity? Book ahead or wing it?
	•	For beginner diving, any schools you loved (patient instructors, smaller classes)?
	•	If we base on one island, which day-trips are must-dos for snorkeling without the party vibe?
	•	Any areas to avoid during that holiday window (gridlock, fireworks, thumping bass till 4am, etc.)?

Bonus context
	•	We’ll end the island time by Jan 4 to get back toward Bangkok before our flight home on Jan 9.
	•	Budget: flexible mid-range (happy with simple, clean, and a nice pool).

TL;DR

Couple wants low-key, renting scooter/walkable, snorkel + beginner scuba, Dec 24–Jan 4 on Thai islands (no parties). From Chiang Mai → islands → back toward Bangkok. Which islands/areas, how many bases, and how to connect flights/ferries smoothly over the holiday rush? Hotel/area and dive-school names very welcome!

1nh8f31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1nh8f31/the_keystone_evening_routine_that_fixed_my/,"The ""Keystone Evening"" routine that fixed my mornings (without waking up earlier)","Everyone kept telling me to ""just wake up earlier"" or build a morning routine. But I'm not a morning person. Never have been, probably never will be.

Then I realized something: good mornings aren't made in the morning they're made the night before.

What I started doing the evening before:

1. Set out tomorrow's clothes. Takes 30 seconds. Saves 10 minutes of decision-making when my brain is still booting up.

I put everything on a chair: underwear, socks, shirt, pants. Even shoes. Zero thinking required.

2. Prep my ""morning fuel"" not talking about a complex breakfast. I mean:

* Water bottle filled and ready
* Coffee setup (if you drink coffee)
* Something easy to grab and eat (like an apple or banana)
* I keep granola bars, bananas, or overnight oats ready. Not healthy but saves me time.

3. Clear the path. I literally walk through my morning routine and remove obstacles:

* Keys in the same spot always
* Bag packed and by the door
* Phone charger unplugged and ready
* Anything I'll trip over moved out of the way

4. Set a 10 minute timer, put things back where they belong. Not deep cleaning just clearing the chaos so I wake up to a calm space instead of yesterday's mess.

5. Plan tomorrow's ONE priority. Write down the single most important thing I need to do. Not a to-do list, just one thing.

When I wake up foggy, I don't have to figure out what matters I already decided.

What changed:

* My mornings went from chaotic scrambling to smooth sailing. I wasn't waking up earlier, but I was getting more done with way less stress.
* I actually started enjoying mornings because they weren't painful anymore.
* Momentum matters. When your morning starts smoothly, everything else feels easier. When it starts chaotic, you're playing catch-up all day.

What I learned:

* You don't have to become a ""morning person"" to have good mornings. You just have to become an ""evening planner.""
* The ripple effect is incredible. Better mornings led to better days. Better days led to better sleep. Better sleep made the evening routine easier.

This helped me more consistent during in waking up early.",76,1757898606.0,Habits,0,0.98,False

for context- me (20f) and my boyfriend (21m) have been together a bit over 2 years. we were friends for a few years before that, so i have known his parents for about 5 years now. his mum (M) (50f) has always been very lovely to me and very welcoming. however, his step dad (SD) (60 maybe? m) has always been a little odd (anti-vax, conspiracy theorist, doesn’t really “believe” in a lot of very real things lol) initially he was fine toward me, but recently has made weird micro aggressions toward me and my boyfriend. my bf and him have always had a strained relationship, as he married his mum when my bf was around 10 and they never really clicked (nothing too bad, just differing personalities). they have one child together (11m) who i am pretty close with (will often buy him deserts and play games with him). as well, i have pretty severe dietary restrictions and can only eat a handful of things. i basically eat the same thing daily. 

a while ago, SD moved mine and my bfs shoes outside from next to the door. this was never really discussed but he said it was because “he was tired of his things begging touched” to M. i have never touched any of his things so found this quite odd but never really followed up. i knew he was a little strange. 


recently, things had been really bad at my home so i have been staying with my bf. i don’t want to be annoying, so i cook dinner for everyone often, clean up, and help with errands for the family. aswell, im often out most days doing my own things or working, so im not really at their house that often. i’m very worried about being annoying, but i think at the moment things are okay. 

as i mentioned earlier, i cannot eat a lot, and what i do eat is practically the same thing daily. recently i have started feeling extremely sick with no clear reason after having my morning coffee, which has never made me sick before. i have the same coffee brand with rice milk (literally the only milk i can have). i have researched both ingredients and they have not changed anything, but i have started reacting to it??? 

because of SDs previous views he has shared, im wondering is he’s putting cows milk or something else into my milk bottle because he doesn’t “believe” in my condition? or if he just hates me lol. 

either way, im working on coming back home. which sucks but doesn’t suck as bad as being sick daily lol. 

sorry if this is all over the place, just hoping for advice or similar experiences ☺️
