When I sit with homeowners and listen to their dreams for their space, I often hear two things:

‚ÄúI want it to look beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù ¬†‚Äú‚Ä¶but it also has to work for my daily life.‚Äù

And honestly? That balance‚Äîbetween form and function‚Äîis the sweet spot of great design.

Because what‚Äôs the point of a stunning kitchen if the storage drives you crazy? Or a jaw-dropping living room that doesn‚Äôt feel cozy when you curl up with your cup of chai?

At **Tanish Dzignz**, we believe you deserve *both*. Your home should be your sanctuary, your style statement, and your support system‚Äîall at once.

Let‚Äôs talk about how to bring functionality and aesthetics together, beautifully and effortlessly.

 

**1. Design for** ***Living*****, Not Just for Looking**

Gorgeous interiors should be *lived in*, not tiptoed around.



* That plush sofa? It should feel as good as it looks.
* The dining table? Big enough for both everyday meals and festive feasts.
* The flooring? Durable *and* delightful underfoot.



**Function-first doesn‚Äôt mean compromising on style‚Äîit means styling with purpose.**

 

**2. Start With ‚ÄúHow You Live‚Äù**

Before picking a color or a curtain, ask yourself:



* What does a regular day in my home look like?
* Where does clutter tend to collect?
* Do I entertain often? Work from home? Practice yoga?



When we design around *your lifestyle*, the space automatically begins to serve you better.

Imagine: A reading nook by the morning light. An entryway that hides your keys, shoes, and bags‚Äîbeautifully. A kitchen that flows so well, cooking feels less like a chore and more like therapy.

 

**3. Let Storage Be Beautiful**

One of the biggest myths? That storage has to be boring.

**Spoiler alert:** It doesn‚Äôt.

From elegant wall units to hidden drawers in beds and coffee tables that double as storage, every corner can work harder *and* look better.

At Tanish Dzignz, we love crafting **custom, built-in solutions** that blend seamlessly into the design‚Äîbecause you shouldn‚Äôt have to choose between clean aesthetics and everyday convenience.

 

**4. Use Design Elements That Do Double Duty**

This is where the magic happens.



* Mirrors that add elegance *and* make your space look bigger.
* Light fixtures that are sculptural *and* functional.
* Accent walls that insulate sound *and* tell a story.



Smart design solves problems while looking like art. That‚Äôs the kind of intentional beauty we aim for.

 

**5. Align With Energy and Ease**

Functionality isn‚Äôt just about storage and layout‚Äîit‚Äôs about **flow**.

When a space feels cluttered or awkward, your *mind* feels it too. That‚Äôs why we integrate **Vastu principles** to ensure your home supports not just your needs, but your *energy*.

It‚Äôs about ease. Grace. A kind of invisible comfort you feel when everything just *works*.",1,1753265477.0,u_Tanishdzignz,0,1.0,False

DINK Life Is Real.,"I‚Äôve been wondering this for a while ‚Äî why don‚Äôt we, as queer people (especially gay men), talk more openly about **money, careers, and financial independence**?

We talk about pop culture, relationships, fashion, and travel (which is great!), but somehow **money feels taboo**, even though for many of us, our lives don‚Äôt follow the same financial timelines or responsibilities as heteronormative paths. **No kids (usually), double income, fewer societal expectations ‚Äî DINK (Dual Income, No Kids) is literally our lifestyle for many!** Yet we rarely take advantage of that in how we plan our future.

Here‚Äôs why we **should** talk about money more:

* üèôÔ∏è **Living in cities is expensive** ‚Äî most queer people migrate to urban spaces for safety and community, but that means rent, inflation, and lifestyle creep hit us hard.
* üíº **Queer people are often pushed into creative or underpaid careers** ‚Äî and we need to start talking about negotiating salaries, starting businesses, investing, and building generational wealth (even if it‚Äôs just for ourselves).
* ‚ù§Ô∏è **Many of us are solo or child-free by choice** ‚Äî that gives us more flexibility to **save, travel, retire early, buy property, or invest in passion projects** ‚Äî but we need to be intentional.
* üß† **Financial literacy = safety**. Especially if you‚Äôre queer and may not have family support, you need to be your own safety net.

Let‚Äôs normalize:

* Talking about **salaries**
* Building **emergency funds** and **retirement plans**
* Choosing high-paying careers without guilt
* Budgeting luxury (yes, you can have iced coffee and investments both!)
* Sharing side hustles, freelance tips, and remote job leads
* Even: how to build wealth as a couple without marriage

This isn‚Äôt about being capitalist robots. It‚Äôs about **freedom and power** ‚Äî to choose our lives, protect ourselves, support each other, and thrive.

So I‚Äôm curious ‚Äî how are *you* managing money as a queer person?  
What are your career goals, side hustles, or financial wins/fears?

1m74ztz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1m74ztz/losing_my_mind_please_help/,"Losing My Mind, Please Help","Get some tea or coffee, maybe a lil snack, because this is going to take a while. Sorry in advance.

I‚Äôm a college student, and my university is an hour away from home. I don‚Äôt drive (phobia), so I delegate my amazing roommate to drive me when I need to go home. My house is halfway between our university and her own family. This is a thing we‚Äôve been doing since high school, and it‚Äôs never been an issue.

Of course, everything is by her schedule, as it should be. I would never ask her to take me home or every weekend. I‚Äôd never do anything like that when she‚Äôs not going home herself. Why am I talking about this in r/cats? 

Because we, stupidly, decided to smuggle two cats into our dorm freshman year since we‚Äôve always loved cats and owned our fair share before. It wasn‚Äôt allowed, but our RA is pretty cool. We kept them from our parents until going home for winter break. Whatever, also not a problem. (Should mention that the cats are completely in my possession now since her mom set a boundary about not having anymore cats in her house. Total cats at my house including these two: 3.)

Sometime during a home visit in the fall of this year (my sophomore year), I found fleas on one of them since his fur is white, easy spot. It was right before my roommate was going to pick me up to return to college. I freaked out from the little time I had and told my mom about it so she could do something. She told me not to worry about it. I assumed she meant that she has it under control.

We‚Äôve never had a serious flea problem before, a few of them popping up here and there on previous pets, but never staying long with a few flea baths. So you‚Äôd think she knows what she‚Äôs doing, right?

I come back for my winter break (a month long). First few days go smoothly, then I see fleas again on the same cat. I freak out again, this time because they had enough of a period to set up shop. I asked my mom if she got anything for the fleas. No. Not even flea baths since they‚Äôre ‚Äúindoor, so the fleas should just go away.‚Äù üòê Ma‚Äôam. 

I get all three of the cats Bravecto for cats. It lasts for three months. I clean the house every day for the rest of the month-long break before I leave again for the spring semester.

I come back for the summer break (it‚Äôs a little *over* three months later.) No fleas!! Yay!! But I find tapeworm segments everywhere. Shock and visceral horror, never had to deal with tapeworms before. 

I did everything people advised on the subreddits to the redditors that came before me (Godspeed). I got them Nexguard Combo for cats even though I was nervous about the harsh ingredients since I needed it delivered (remember, phobia of driving), and that was all my vet pharmacy had that‚Äôd kill the tapeworms. Cleaned every square inch, vacuumed religiously, safely bleached litter boxes, washed toys, etc.

It‚Äôs a couple months later. The cats are damn near spoiled with how much attention they get. It‚Äôs vet checkups every month, wet food constantly since I went down a cat-health rabbit hole, flea comb-throughs twice every day,  *constantly* cleaned litter boxes, a paranoia-induced clean house, etc. 

Keep in mind, I‚Äôm a remote summer student with three classes and have a job. My parents work full time, and my family (4 other people) doesn‚Äôt clean up after themselves often. I‚Äôm left to do it for them. I am stretched thin right now, but I‚Äôd do anything for my cats. Literally, anything. I love them with all of my heart. I really don‚Äôt mind spending all of my money on them or cleaning after them every waking hour that I can manage.

However, it‚Äôs taken a massive chuck of my mental health that was already pretty bad considering I lost a friend my spring semester due to her own mental health and almost lost another for the same reason (but she‚Äôs okay, got tons of support from our group and was checked into a psych ward.) My mom and brother are very concerned by my recent behavior, and my anxiety is through the roof because of *fleas.* Those stupid parasitic bastards. I seriously freak the hell out every time my cats scratch themselves or groom even though I never see fleas anymore. I‚Äôm shaking right now even thinking about it.

I have to leave again for the fall semester in August. I‚Äôm not concerned about anything medical, our vet only ten minutes from me by car with a close relationship to them. What I need advice with is calming the hell down. D‚Äôyou think I handled this situation well? Should I just leave it alone from now on and ease up? D‚Äôyou think I can leave the rest in my mom‚Äôs hands since she knows things to look out for now and what to do (I rant to her extensively about this)? She keeps telling me to relax, but that‚Äôs not how anxiety works. Thank you; anything helps <3

1m74tel,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Strivexglobalexport/comments/1m74tel/indian_agriculture_export_boom_opportunities/,Indian Agriculture Export Boom: Opportunities & Challenges,"# 1. Introduction

India is rapidly emerging as a top-tier¬†**agriculture exporter**, with the value of¬†**agricultural export from India**¬†growing steadily. Beyond boosting foreign exchange earnings, this boom empowers farmers, strengthens rural economies, and positions India as a global food supplier. Strivex Global stands ready to help exporters scale and succeed.

# 2. Current Export Landscape

* In FY‚ÄØ2023‚Äì24, India‚Äôs agri-exports reached¬†**US‚ÄØ$48.9‚ÄØbillion**, rebounding to approximately¬†**US‚ÄØ$52‚ÄØbillion**¬†in FY‚ÄØ2024‚Äì25. 
* Major export categories include: 
   * **Rice**: A record¬†**$12.5‚ÄØbillion**¬†in FY‚ÄØ2024‚Äì25, more than 20% of total agri-exports. 
   * **Spices**: $4.45‚ÄØbillion. 
   * **Coffee**: $1.81‚ÄØbillion. 
   * **Tea**: $0.92‚ÄØbillion‚Äînow at a 10-year high.

* India is expanding offers in processed foods, RTE meals, packaged spices, and fruit concentrates. 

# 3.2. New Markets & Trade Deals

* Exporters can tap into growth in the Middle East, Africa, EU, East Asia. 
* The Indian government has:

* Digitization initiatives like traceability platforms, blockchain in Punjab‚Äôs AEZs, AI-driven pest and weather analytics. 

# 4. Challenges

# 4.1. Price Volatility & Standards

* Strong global competition forces Indian exporters to maintain high standards‚Äînon-tariff barriers and inconsistent certification still hamper growth .

# 4.3. Policy Balancing & Global Headwinds

* Protectionist policies from key markets‚Äîsuch as the US reciprocal tariffs and subsidy barriers for dairy‚Äîpose long-term risks. 

# 5. Strategies for Exporters

# 5.1. Diversify & Add Value

* Invest in millets, processed foods, organic products, and functionality-rich goods. 
* Explore certifications like organic, fair trade, and geographic indications. 

# 5.2. Enhance Quality & Compliance

* Use digital platforms like e-NAM for direct farmer access and linking. 

# 5.5. Policy Engagement & Cluster Development

* Work with APEDA, export councils, AEZ and governmental bodies for resource mobilization. 
* Expand clusters using programs like Agri Export Zones revisited under Gati Shakti plans.

1. Phone and laptop on do not disturb

3. Task list of the tasks I'm working on (IN THAT SESSION ONLY)

4. Tracking time with Toggl

5. Lofi with noise-cancelling headphones

To be honest with you guys, I've tried and test eda whole bunch of routines with a whole bunch of different steps and this one works the best. It's also even better if I have a coffee, but not after 1pm or I won't be able to sleep.

I track my time so I can see exactly how much I'm actually working, like see ""ok, I worked for 6 hours today""  so I can see what days I'm slacking, and identify what was distracting me from working. 

Also, I hate pomodoro, as it doesn't allow me to get in focus, so I just work until I feel like quitting. However, this is usually past my first feelings of uncomfortableness, and I push through. 

My sessions average 1-3 hours long at a time before I take a break to rest my eyes. (I'm not counting when I go to the restroom)

I have been prescribed Gabepentin 100 mg twice a day for cervical nerve pain, as a treatment tentative. This is a very low dose so I did not expect side effects or whatever. 

First day, I took the evening dose, and I slept ok but had crazy nightmares. Second day I took it and felt a bit drunk but happy and radically pain-free, what a bliss. I had some weird dreams at night. The third day I took it and the morning, with my coffee, I felt a very weird drunk-like effect for hours which was not good, then I felt pain free. 

However, I figured the effects were too strong. For instance I could not imagine drive even at this low dosage. So I decided to not take the following dose.

And here oh my god I don't know what happened, I woke up with crazy nausea and diarrhea, shivers, hot and cold spells, low-grade fever, mental confusion. I was close to go to ER. This really felt like withdrawal effects, it reminded me a benzodiazepine withdrawal I had years ago. 

Evening I decided to take 100mg and a couple of hours later I felt much better. But I am now quitting this. 

It's crazy how some people take huge dose and are ok with it. Those 2x100mg were crazy for me.

##‚Äå Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness‚Å£ and appeal of scented‚Å¢ beads hinge on several key‚Äå features that influence their performance and user satisfaction.

**Scent Longevity:** The duration for which scented ‚Äãbeads effectively release fragrance is a crucial factor. ‚Å£generally, high-quality scented beads are designed ‚Äçto ‚Å§maintain ‚Å£their ‚Å£scent ‚Å£for several weeks or‚Äã even months.

The longevity‚Å§ typically depends on the size of the beads, the concentration of fragrance oils, and‚Å¢ the ambient temperature ‚Äçand‚Äã humidity. Some brands‚Å£ utilize‚Å§ advanced encapsulation technologies to slowly release‚Å¢ the scent over extended periods. Testing in controlled environments reveals that certain‚Å£ brands‚Äå maintain a consistent fragrance output for‚Å§ up‚Äç to 90 days, while others may loose ‚Å§their potency after just a few weeks.

**Scent‚Å§ Variety and Complexity:** The range of available scents and the complexity of the fragrance‚Äå profiles are significant considerations‚Äå for consumers.‚Å§ Top ‚Äåbrands offer a diverse selection,ranging from classic floral and fruity scents to more sophisticated and unique blends.

Complex fragrances frequently ‚Äãenough contain multiple layers of notes, creating a more nuanced‚Äç and engaging scent experience. The ‚Äåquality of the fragrance oils‚Äç used also plays a vital ‚Å§role, as higher-quality oils tend to be more authentic and longer-lasting. Many manufacturers also offer seasonal or limited-edition ‚Å¢scents to cater to changing‚Äç consumer ‚Äçpreferences throughout the year.

**Bead Material and‚Å¢ Composition:** The‚Å¢ material used to create the‚Å§ scented beads affects‚Äã their durability, scent‚Äã absorption, ‚Äãand overall safety. Common materials ‚Äåinclude silica gel,polymers,and‚Å¢ natural clays.

Each material has its own advantages and disadvantages. Silica gel is ‚Äåhighly absorbent and effective at releasing ‚Å§fragrance, ‚Äçbut it can ‚Äåbe brittle and prone to ‚Å¢breakage. Polymers ‚Å§offer ‚Äãgreater durability and ‚Å£flexibility, but‚Äå they may‚Äå not absorb scents as effectively as‚Äã silica gel. Natural clays are often considered more eco-kind,but they can be less consistent in terms of scent release. Selecting beads ‚Äãmade from non-toxic and environmentally friendly materials is crucial‚Å£ for both personal and environmental health.

**Container Design ‚Äãand ‚Å¢Functionality:** The container in which the scented beads are housed impacts both the aesthetic appeal and the practical functionality of the product.Innovative designs that allow for‚Å¢ adjustable scent release are especially desirable.

Containers range from simple mesh‚Äå bags to decorative jars to sophisticated dispensers with adjustable vents. The design should not only complement the‚Å§ surrounding‚Å£ d√©cor but also effectively control the diffusion‚Å¢ of the fragrance. Some containers feature refillable ‚Å£options, reducing waste and offering ‚Å¢a more‚Å§ sustainable alternative. ‚Å¢The container‚Å§ should also be durable and resistant to spills or ‚Äåleaks ‚Å§to prevent messes and ensure long-lasting ‚Å£use.

**Safety and Allergen‚Äç Considerations:** given their widespread use, the safety and allergen‚Å£ profile of ‚Äãscented beads are paramount. Manufacturers should clearly‚Å¢ disclose all ingredients and provide warnings regarding‚Å¢ potential allergens or sensitivities.

Consumers should prioritize ‚Å¢products that are free from harsh chemicals, such as phthalates and formaldehyde, which can pose health risks. Some brands offer hypoallergenic options formulated with natural or plant-based fragrances to minimize the risk of allergic reactions. Reading product labels carefully‚Å£ and conducting patch tests before widespread use are essential steps in ensuring safety and minimizing potential ‚Äåadverse effects.

Key‚Äç features of‚Äå high-quality scented beads include:

*   Extended ‚Å¢scent longevity (up to 90 days)
* ‚Äã‚Äå  Diverse range ‚Å£of fragrance options
*   Durable and‚Å£ safe bead materials
*  ‚Å§ Functional and ‚Å£aesthetically pleasing container designs
*   Transparent disclosure of ingredients and allergen ‚Å§information

Chapter One
Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

Chapter Two
‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

Chapter Three
Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

Chapter Four
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù",1,1753261741.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1m7499f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NinjaLuxeCafe/comments/1m7499f/typical_settings_signs_of_a_faulty_unit/,Typical settings - signs of a faulty unit,"Morning all. I‚Äôm aware that a number of units have fault issues, such as the grind reducing to 1 and not changing with different beans, as well as incorrect dosing or ratio between the grind size and espresso size. I think it would be helpful to know what the typical indicators are that you have a faulty unit and what the ‚Äúideal‚Äù or ‚Äútypical‚Äù measurements are for a decent espresso.

I‚Äôve had my unit since late April and since then the grind size has progressively got finer and finer until it reached 1. Coffee is okay but often on the bitter side even with tweaking the grind setting. I have the strength set for 2.5:1. Measured coffee grind weight is 18g but espresso size rarely hits the ratio, I.e. 45g. Varies anything from 25g to 65g. Time to dispense the shot also varies but this morning with a grind setting of 5 it took 50sec from the moment of pressing the dispense button until it bleeped to indicate it was finished.

It truly seems to me there's a certain ""gentlemanly"" aspect to it, focusing on actions that are thoughtful, measured, and contribute positively to the overall well-being of the neighborhood.

For example, rather of just buying a coffee at the local shop (which is great!), considering setting up a recurring order to support them even during slower weeks. Or perhaps volunteering time to a local organization that directly impacts the community, like the library or a neighborhood cleanup group: consistent, reliable support can be just as crucial as donations. It's about seeing the needs and finding a way to contribute in a meaningful, long-term fashion rather than a fleeting gesture.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Once Caldas vs. San Antonio Bulo Bulo: A Tale of Two Teams (One Has a Plan, the Other Needs a Miracle)**

The Copa Sudamericana return leg between Once Caldas and San Antonio Bulo Bulo is a match where math meets masochism. The Bolivian underdogs, down 3-0 from the first leg, now face a near-impossible task: score three goals *and* keep a clean sheet on Colombian soil. Meanwhile, Once Caldas, the 64% favorite per Bet365, needs to avoid a collapse so historic it could earn them a spot in the *Guinness World Records* for ""Most Unnecessary Victory."" Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a spreadsheet and the humor of a sports bar bet gone wrong.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Once Caldas is the Statistical King of This Party

The bookmakers aren‚Äôt just handing Once Caldas the crown‚Äîthey‚Äôre *begging* you to bet on them. At decimal odds of 1.21 (implied probability: **82.6%**), they‚Äôre priced like a sure thing at a buffet‚Äî*everyone* wants a slice of this cake. San Antonio, meanwhile, sits at a laughable 12.0 (implied probability: **7.7%**), which is about the same chance as me correctly predicting the outcome of my Monday morning coffee order. The draw? A 15.4% shot, which feels about right for a game where one team needs a miracle and the other just needs to not trip over their own feet.

Why the lopsided numbers? Once Caldas has the experience of a seasoned rockstar (think: 20 years of international gigs) versus San Antonio‚Äôs rookie status‚Äîlike a toddler in a room full of adults. Plus, they‚Äôre playing at home, where they‚Äôve historically oozed offensive flair. San Antonio? They‚Äôre trying to pull off a comeback that would make *Harry Potter* question his own luck.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and the Weight of Expectation

Once Caldas is struggling in the Colombian league (*0 points, last place*), but let‚Äôs not conflate domestic despair with continental incompetence. They‚Äôve got a history of rising for the big occasion, like a student who bombs all tests but acing the final. Their coach is expected to start a ‚Äús

1m740ge,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m740ge/what_size_sectional_should_i_get_for_my_living/,What size sectional should I get for my living room?,"I recently went through the challenging process of choosing a sectional sofa for my living room, and I wanted to share what I learned to help others make this important decision.

First, measure your living room carefully. You'll need to account for walking paths (at least 30 inches wide) and ensure the sectional won't block doorways or windows. I made the mistake of eyeballing it initially, which almost led to a costly error.

Here's a quick guide on room sizes and corresponding sectional dimensions:
- Small rooms (150-200 sq ft): 80-90 inches wide
- Medium rooms (200-300 sq ft): 95-120 inches wide
- Large rooms (300+ sq ft): 120+ inches wide

The shape of your sectional matters too. L-shaped sectionals work well in corner arrangements, while U-shaped ones are perfect for large, open spaces. I found some great options at https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa that helped me visualize different configurations.

Consider the number of people in your household. A good rule of thumb is to allow 24-30 inches of seating space per person. My family of four needed at least 96 inches of seating space for comfortable daily use.

Don't forget about the depth! Standard sectional depth ranges from 36-40 inches. If you're tall like me (6'2""), you might want to look for deeper options around 40-42 inches for maximum comfort.

Scale is crucial - a massive sectional in a tiny room will make the space feel cramped, while a small sectional in a large room might look underwhelming. After researching extensively, I found several perfectly sized options at https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa that worked well for my space.

Some practical tips I learned:
- Draw the sectional dimensions on your floor using painter's tape
- Account for reclining features if included
- Consider the size of your doorways and elevators for delivery
- Leave about 18 inches between the sectional and coffee table
- Factor in other furniture pieces in the room

Remember, the right sectional size should provide enough seating while maintaining good traffic flow and visual balance in your room. Take your time with this decision - it's a significant investment that you'll live with for years.",1,1753260374.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

The project quickly became much more serious than we initially imagined, and we started focusing heavily on it, hoping that maybe one day we could release it on Steam or something like that.

Of course, this isn‚Äôt the first roguelike deckbuilder to be made since Balatro came out, nor the first to mix that genre with Yahtzee mechanics, but we‚Äôre hoping to stand out a bit by adding a fun feature that can create endlessly varied gameplay situations: each face of every die can be swapped with a new one featuring different effects.

We have a bunch of other gameplay ideas in the works to make runs more flexible, and so far we‚Äôve implemented around twenty different types of dice.

The idea is that the game takes place in an office environment : you face off against coworkers at their desks and go up against a manager before moving on to the next floor.

You can smoke cigarettes to gain effects and boosts, or drink coffee to level up your hands!

This is an early demo, so go easy on us haha. The game‚Äôs still pretty stiff when it comes to animations, but we‚Äôd love to hear your first impressions :)",15,1753260373.0,love2d,1,1.0,False

1m7402z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1m7402z/not_sure_how_or_whether_to_get_the_trust_back/,Not sure how or whether to get the trust back,"My partner and I have been together almost two years and alcohol has been present since the beginning. At first, I thought his drinking was mainly because we were getting to know one another and having fun but I gradually started to feel uneasy about how much he drank. I really began to notice that it was an issue when we went away for a family holiday (me and my then 12 yr old and my partner). We went to a pub for lunch and he spent more time at the bar back and forth to the table than he did with us. I drove us back to the holiday home and he kept on drinking all afternoon (and drank the owners booze too). He absolutely stank of alcohol the next day and I had to drive us home because he was most definitely over the limit. There was no apology or acknowledgement that he had overdone it. I told him when we got home that I was concerned by how much he was drinking and that I thought he needed to reign it in. I suggested we do dry Jan which he agreed to.

Fast forward to mid Jan and i noticed that the whiskey bottle in the cabinet was a very strange light yellow colour. Turns out it was mostly water and after confronting him about this he came clean and told me he had been drinking it and watering it down. After this, I have periodically smelt alcohol on his breath during the middle of the day, but he has denied drinking. I have found more bottles of whiskey or other booze in the cabinet or in his car. When I confronted him he said he hid it to avoid conflict with me (even though he drinks in front of me, and we will have a glass of wine together over dinner). Every holiday we have been on involves him binge drinking every day. And sometimes when we've been away he will have whiskey in his coffee in the morning or a glass of wine.

He has consistently denied he has a drinking problem (although I have threatened to leave him if there is any more dishonesty and he now admits that maybe there is a problem). But I grew up in a house where alcohol was normalised so I am having a hard time trusting my gut. He is also kind and patient and doesn't get angry so I know it could be worse. But he has normalised dishonesty and deception and I have lost my trust in him and in our relationship.¬†

He has now said he will quit drinking and as far as I know he has not had any alcohol for the past week. I asked him how he thinks we should move forward now and he said 'let's live our lives with love and positivity' and that time will tell. That's a beautiful sentiment, in theory, but how do I lean in and do this in practice when I have resentment and mistrust? I don't know how to maintain emotional closeness with someone that I do not trust. The flip side of that is that my not leaning in and 'living life with love and positivity', means that I am not really supporting him on his new journey.¬†I feel stuck.¬†

I guess i am just seeking advice as to whether we can move forward and past this. I am pretty new to all this but I don't want to spend the rest of my life in a hyper vigilant state and I feel like that is where I am at right now.

Every street corner is a reminder of us.,"I never thought I'd be writing this, but I really need your advice.

**Background:**¬†My girlfriend and I had our whole life mapped out or so I thought. We explored every corner of this city together, had our favorite coffee shop, our spot by the river, even our grocery store and a specific mall where we used to meet by skipping classes. Three weeks ago, she told me ""I am irritating her and I needs to find another girl"" and moved out. Done.

**The Problem:**¬†I'm completely paralyzed in my own city. I can't go to the main area we both went to because I see her waiting near the shop where she used to wait for me . I can't grab coffee without remembering how we used to drink coffee together. Hell, I can't even take my usual route to work because we used to walk that path together. It's like she's a ghost haunting every street corner, every restaurant, every park bench.

**The Worst Part:**¬†The mornings are absolutely brutal. For those first few seconds when I wake up, my brain forgets she's gone. I'll reach for my phone to see her message. And the dreams... the dreams where we're still together are somehow worse than the nightmares. I wake up feeling like I've lost her all over again.

I've thrown myself into work and started hitting the gym religiously just to exhaust myself enough to sleep. I'm emotionally and mentally drained, but I keep telling myself I can't waste any more time wallowing. I've even started reading philosophy books and exploring spiritual practices, trying to find some deeper meaning in all this pain. Part of me wants to dedicate my life to helping others or humanitarian work.

**My Thoughts:**¬†I know everyone says ""time heals all wounds"" and ""you'll find someone better,"" but right now I can't even imagine wanting to be with anyone else. I'm starting to wonder if I should just move to a different city entirely to escape all these memories, but that feels like running away. At the same time, I can't keep living like a prisoner in my own hometown.

We built a life together, and now I don't know how to live in the spaces we once shared. I'm trying to be strong and focus on self-improvement, but some days I feel like I'm barely keeping my head above water.

**Questions for you:**

* For those who've been through something similar, how did you reclaim your city and your life after a major breakup?
* How long did it take before you could go to your old spots without feeling gutted?

I'm genuinely lost here and could use some perspective from people who've walked this path before me.

**TL;DR:**¬†My ex-girlfriend and I built our life around our city. Now that she's gone, I can't go anywhere without being flooded with memories of us together. The mornings are the worst, and I'm considering either moving cities or dedicating my life to something bigger.

I recently spent a long weekend there and wanted to share my actual costs and recommendations to help others budget their trips.

Let's break down the essential expenses:

Accommodation: $150-300 per night
Hotels in Miami vary widely. I stayed at a mid-range hotel in Downtown Miami for $200/night. You can find cheaper options in Miami Springs or splurge on South Beach luxury. Airbnb is another good option, often cheaper than hotels.

Food: $50-80 per day
Miami's food scene is diverse. I spent about:
- Breakfast: $10-15 (local cafes, Cuban coffee shops)
- Lunch: $15-20 (food trucks, casual restaurants)
- Dinner: $25-45 (mid-range restaurants)
Save money by having breakfast at your hotel if included, or grab Cuban pastries from local bakeries.

Transportation: $30-50 per day
- From airport: $25 for Uber/Lyft one way
- Getting around: Either rent a car ($40-60/day) or use ride-sharing ($30-40/day)
The Metrorail and buses are cheaper options at $5.65 for a day pass.

Activities:
Must-do experiences I recommend:
- Everglades National Park Airboat Tour: $42 (totally worth it - I booked through https://athometouch.com/miami and had an amazing time seeing alligators up close)
- South Beach: Free
- Vizcaya Museum: $25
- Little Havana food tour: $60
- Wynwood Walls: Free

Total Budget Breakdown for 3 Days:
Basic: $600-800
- Budget hotel/Airbnb
- Local food spots
- Public transportation
- Mix of free and paid activities

Moderate: $900-1200
- Mid-range hotel
- Better restaurants
- Ride-sharing/car rental
- More paid activities

Luxury: $1500+
- Upscale hotel
- Fine dining
- Car rental
- Premium experiences

Money-Saving Tips:
1. Visit during shoulder season (April-May, September-November)
2. Book activities in advance
3. Look for package deals
4. Stay outside tourist zones
5. Use hotel rewards points
6. Mix expensive activities with free ones like beach days

Remember to factor in:
- Travel insurance
- Shopping budget
- Tips (15-20% standard)
- Emergency fund

Miami can be expensive, but with smart planning, you can have an amazing time without overspending. The Everglades tour was definitely my trip highlight - seeing those alligators in their natural habitat was incredible.

So I've been here a few years and I swear the procurement process is slowly killing me. Anyone else dealing with this stuff or is it just my program?

They live in a completely different timeline than us. We finish design reviews and need parts like yesterday, but procurement is talking about 12-week lead times minimum. Then they act surprised when schedules slip. Everything's about finding the cheapest option too. Try explaining to them why we can't just swap in the knockoff Chinese part that's $20 cheaper when the original has 5 years of qual data behind it. ""But it has the same part number!"" 

By the time all the approvals go through, half the components are EOL or the supplier changed something. Then we get to start over. Need a specific RF component that literally only one company makes? Better clear your schedule for the next week to fill out forms explaining why water is wet. And don't even get me started on when they change suppliers without telling us. ""Oh yeah, we switched vendors for that capacitor. Same specs though!"" Meanwhile our EMI performance just went to hell because the new part has different parasitics.

How do you guys handle the timing issues? Just pad everything by 6 months? Anyone actually managed to get procurement to listen about technical requirements? What's the magic words for sole source justifications that actually work?

Look, I get that procurement has their own nightmare regulations and cost targets to hit. But man, sometimes it feels like we're working for completely different companies. Anyone got war stories or actual solutions that work? Or should I just accept that this is how defense contracting works and stock up on coffee?

## Key Features Analysis

The best coffee extracts stand out due to several key features. These details determine the quality, flavor, and overall usability of the extract.

**Concentration:** the concentration of coffee solids in the extract directly impacts its flavor intensity.

A higher concentration means that less extract is needed to achieve the desired coffee flavor, making it more cost-effective in the long run. Concentrated extracts frequently enough deliver a more nuanced and robust coffee taste, as thay contain a higher proportion of essential oils and aromatic compounds. Manufacturers often indicate the concentration level. A higher concentration generally implies a more intense flavor profile.

**Extraction Method:** The method used to extract the coffee flavor from the beans significantly influences the final product's taste and quality.

Cold brew extraction, for instance, tends to produce a smoother, less acidic extract compared to heat-based methods. Supercritical CO2 extraction is a more advanced technique that preserves delicate aroma compounds and results in a cleaner flavor profile.Customary methods may yield extracts with a richer, more intense flavor but also potentially introduce some bitterness. Choosing an extract made using a high-quality extraction method helps to guarantee flavor integrity and reduces the likelihood of undesirable aftertastes.

**Bean Origin and Roast:** the origin and roast level of the coffee beans used play a crucial role in shaping the extract's flavor profile.

Single-origin extracts showcase distinct regional characteristics, like the fruity notes of Ethiopian Yirgacheffe or the chocolatey undertones of Sumatran Mandheling. Dark roasts typically yield extracts with a bolder, more intense flavor, while light roasts offer a brighter, more acidic profile. Some producers may blend different coffee beans for a more balanced and complex flavor. The specific bean origin and roast level will impact the overall taste and aroma of the final extract, catering to different flavor preferences.

**Ingredients and Additives:** A high-quality coffee extract should ideally contain minimal ingredients, primarily coffee and perhaps a small amount of alcohol (for stabilization purposes).

Avoid extracts with excessive additives, artificial flavors, or preservatives, as these can detract from the pure coffee taste. Some extracts may contain added sugars or glycerin to enhance sweetness or viscosity, but these can also mask the authentic coffee flavor. Reading the ingredient list carefully helps to ensure that you are selecting a clean, natural extract.

**Packaging and Storage:** Proper packaging is vital for preserving the extract's flavor and freshness over time.

Dark glass bottles are preferred, as they help protect the extract from light exposure, which can degrade flavor compounds. Airtight seals are also essential to prevent oxidation and evaporation. Storing the extract in a cool, dark place, such as a pantry or cupboard, will further prolong its shelf life. Check for tamper-evident seals to ensure product integrity.

## core Benefits

Coffee extract provides several essential benefits for both professional and at-home culinary enthusiasts.

**Enhanced Flavor Intensity:** Coffee extract delivers a concentrated burst of coffee flavor, allowing users to enhance the taste of various recipes without adding excess liquid. This is especially beneficial in delicate pastries and desserts where maintaining the right consistency is crucial. A few drops of high-quality coffee extract can dramatically intensify the mocha notes in a chocolate cake or add depth to a creamy tiramisu.

**Versatile Submission:** Coffee extract can be used in a wide range of culinary applications, from flavoring baked goods and desserts to enhancing beverages and sauces. It can be added to frostings, glazes, ice creams, and even savory dishes to provide a subtle coffee undertone. Baristas often use it to formulate innovative coffee cocktails, such as espresso martinis with an enhanced profile.

**Convenience and Efficiency:** Unlike brewing coffee, coffee extract offers a convenient and efficient way to add coffee flavor to recipes. It eliminates the need for measuring coffee grounds, brewing, and cooling. Simply add a few drops to the desired recipe for instant flavor infusion.This saves time and effort and reduces the cleanup involved with traditional coffee readiness.

**Consistent Results:** Coffee extract ensures consistent results every time, as the flavor concentration remains constant. This is especially important in commercial baking and beverage preparation, where uniformity is key. Using extract eliminates the variability that can occur with freshly brewed coffee, ensuring that each batch maintains a consistent taste and aroma.

## FAQs Section

**Can I use coffee extract instead of espresso in recipes?**
Yes, coffee extract can be used as a substitute for espresso in recipes, particularly in baked goods and desserts.However, the intensity of the flavor will vary depending on the concentration of the extract. A general guideline is to use approximately 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of coffee extract for every shot of espresso called for in the recipe. It is best to start with a smaller amount and adjust based on taste.

**Does coffee extract contain caffeine?**
Most coffee extracts do contain caffeine, although the amount is typically significantly lower than in brewed coffee or espresso. The exact caffeine content depends on the extraction method and the type of coffee beans used. If you are sensitive to caffeine, it is best to check the product label for specific information or opt for a decaffeinated coffee extract if available.

**How should I store coffee extract to maintain its quality?**
Coffee extract should be stored in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and heat. A pantry or cupboard is ideal. Ensure the bottle is tightly sealed after each use to prevent oxidation and evaporation. Proper storage will help to preserve the extract's flavor and aroma profile. Avoid storing the extract in the refrigerator,as temperature fluctuations can cause condensation and affect its quality over time.

I work from Tuesdays to Sundays everyday from 8am to 5pm. On two days of the week i work from 6am to 6pm. And i hate my customers. None of us in this business are professionals, we are amateur cooks and bakers. I am exhausted from working this much.

My father is a salesman in here, and knows everyone in this town. So everyone in here knows who i am. We have many regular customers, and they stay in at the shop to chat with me, about weather or anything. I dont mind that because its part of the job. But the thing that annoys me, is when they start asking personal questions, about where i live, where i study. Mind u most of these customers are men in their 50s. 

The thing that really gets me is when i go for a walk after my work( my way of relaxing) and if the customers run into me they start talking to me in my free time. Like I dont know you, i dont want to know you, i simply just work and talk to you because its my job and i have to. I am already always at work, i dont want to keep on the fake personality i am putting on at work, while on my free time. I might be overwhelmed and overreacting but its so annoying and sucking the life out of me. 

I am grateful to everyone who spends a dollar in my shop, just to clear that up.

So aita?

I feel bad because some of my stuffed toys have been more loved on than others over the years and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm hurting their feelings. 

I have to fold my clothes and put them on the bottom of the clean pile so that all my clothes get worn just as much as each other. 

I have meals on rotation, and sometimes that means I end up eating dinner for breakfast and breakfast for dinner.

My gym workout is also on rotation. 

So is my shower routine.

So is my laundry routine. 

I‚Äôm not diagnosed. 

I eat sitting crossed-legged on the floor, preferably with a spoon. Because why would you eat at the table with a knife and fork if a spoon is sufficient? 

I can bench press more than I can squat. Neither figure is very impressive. 

I don‚Äôt have a passport. Planes scare me. So does the moon when it goes large and orange, but I feel like the plane phobia is slightly more rational. 

I don‚Äôt drink coffee because it‚Äôs yuck. I have pre-workout, and then pee fifteen times because I have a small and sensitive bladder. 

I cannot reach the top shelf.

I have a horrible taste in music 

I have a DVD collection because I refuse to stream. 

I thought the Matrix was boring. 

But I‚Äôm a little bit cute, and sometimes I‚Äôm funny, so let me know if you‚Äôre interested!

1m73l88,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentTexts/comments/1m73l88/the_echoes_that_stay/,The Echoes That Stay.,"It‚Äôs been two weeks.

I‚Äôve deleted Instagram. I‚Äôve distanced myself from everything that used to pull me back in. And still, somehow, I find myself checking WhatsApp. Just to see if there‚Äôs a message waiting. Just to see if maybe, for once, the silence ends with your name lighting up on my screen.

I know how ridiculous that sounds.

But the truth is, I think about you every day. Not in the same sharp, aching way I used to‚Ä¶ but in quiet flashes. In songs I can‚Äôt skip. In late-night thoughts I don‚Äôt know how to silence. In coffee cups and empty seats and passing laughter that sounds a little too familiar.

It‚Äôs strange ‚Äî how some people stay in your system long after they‚Äôve left your life.

I‚Äôve tried to move forward. Tried to let it all drift into the background like some half-remembered dream. But some memories? They don‚Äôt fade. They haunt gently. They linger. And I think the hardest part isn‚Äôt even missing you.

It‚Äôs missing the version of me that existed when you were around.

I was softer. More open. Hopeful, even. And now? Now I‚Äôm learning how to build a version of myself without waiting for you to be part of it.

This isn‚Äôt a plea. This isn‚Äôt a hope that you‚Äôll suddenly appear with answers or apologies. I‚Äôm not writing this for you anymore.

I‚Äôm writing this for me ‚Äî for the boy who loved with everything he had, even if it went unnoticed. For the boy who still checks his phone, even knowing better.

Maybe someday I‚Äôll stop doing that too.

But not today.

They‚Äôre not that expensive, super sustainable, gorgeous interiors, take out cups are mad good quality, and the coffee is just so flavourful.

1m73k7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_ThinSignificance444/comments/1m73k7w/its_eating_me/,It's eating me,"I never thought I would be in that situation so now I ended up asking for advice from strangers ...I don't even know if I am capable of following an advice either. I unfortunately have to choose between the man I want to spend my life with and my parents. Maybe if I set boundaries it would be all right but every time I try I always give up .my father doesn't work...he haven't had a job in 10 years, I am 23 and since I remembered it was like that and the worst is that my father is a manchild .I remember my family to function depending on my father's feelings and mood and for a little girl that ment in my subconscious thet he is more important. We never had a lot of money my mother is a janitor in a supermarket and we had the help of my grandparents whose I lost 4 years ago .since then I am like the father of the family emotionally to my other 3 younger siblings and financially. I work since 17 and never kept a dime and I was stupid for that .The thing is that my father smokes and drink coffee, his addiction is really bad ,if he doesn't do those for more than 2 days he is irritated he curses and says we are ungrateful if we don't give him money for that . After I usually step back then everything is ok in his eyes even if i don't trust him anymore even if the bubble of the perfect funny father has burst even if I don't have 20 euros until 15 days for the next paycheck. My boyfriend doesn't like any of these and is normal ...I would feel the same if I was him . He says that he wants a life to build together to do whatever we like ...and I would like that too, but in the end I lie to him about the money I give to my family I lie about my feelings if something happened at home and I am tired of telling him that . I feel like I hold him back cause I know that the situation with my family is not going to change ...I cannot find the courage to change it .
*Some details: my father is a manchild for those reason->he always asks for help for anything like getting him a plate of food or make him coffee , he is the father but he doesn't understand he doesn't act like one ...fun and games are good but I cannot trur him anymore .besides being poor I would say that's not our problem ,the problem is that my mom's salary is 800euros mine as well and renting a house for 400 , electric bill etc are not enough and my father can't hold back on cigarettes and coffee..we give like 300 euros for that . When I Firstly started dating my boyfriend he wouldn't understand our boundaries in personal time , he would call like 5 times in 2 hours, I would sleep in my boyfriend's and he would call at 7 in the morning to tell me he needs money for cigarettes .he curses if something doesn't go his way and lastly he haven't find a job in 3 years .now that he is 57 he remembered to apply for a job he didn't get and only cause I told him that I need to have my own life ...he ""tried "" now ...why not the other 10 years that he was younger ? 
About mom ->she does whatever she can that's all I can tell but her big mistake is that she unintentionally supported all that behavior ..if I was her I would divorce him for the sake of the children. 
About 2 younger siblings-> they are 13 and 16 so they cannot help in the situation financially
About my 20 year old brother->he tries to do his own life and in that way I am the one that has everything to do . He gives like 200euros while I give almost 400 every month even if I don't live with my family I live with my boyfriend . I talked to him many times and he seem to doesn't care that I have all that burden in the meantime I cannot blame him either. 
About me-> I am a people's pleaser I cannot say no and it's eating the life out of me . I am a flight attendant my boyfriend helped me get that degree he helped me put some basic boundaries to my family .
Back to the story 
The rest of my family understand my boundaries and that I want to build a life ,I don't have a problem to give an amount of money to help but my father doesn't stop with coffee and cigarettes...those money are a lot for us .If I was able to say no I would do it but then hw calls me crying for money or he makes me feel guilty and in the end I cannot say no .It hurts me that my own father cannon put his needs aside for his child ,I hold him I am tired I take medication for stress I have 2 small tumors in my neck made from stress.
Why my own father ...and I keep saying yes cause I think that things will get better but I don't know what I am waiting anymore .
My boyfriend wants to take a new job in another city he asked me if anything is going to change from now on ...I don't know. Should I break up with him and stop trying and accept that my family is never going to change or should I set some boundaries with my family and live with my boyfriend to try and make my own life ?",1,1753258522.0,u_ThinSignificance444,0,1.0,False
