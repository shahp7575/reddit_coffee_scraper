1qqgsfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qqgsfu/my_apartment_wasnt_on_the_building_map/,My Apartment Wasn’t on the Building Map,"I noticed it on a Tuesday which somehow made it worse. Tuesdays are forgettable. Nothing strange is supposed to happen on a Tuesday. I was standing in the building office waiting for the manager to finish printing a copy of the emergency evacuation plan. I glanced at the map taped to the wall out of boredom tracing the floors with my finger counting stairwells exits apartment numbers. When I reached my floor I frowned. The hallway was there. The stairwell was there. The elevator shaft was there. But my apartment number wasn’t.

I laughed at first and assumed it was an old map. Buildings update things all the time. Units get renumbered combined split. Still something about it bothered me enough that I asked the manager a tired looking man named Carl who always smelled faintly of burnt coffee. I pointed to the spot where my apartment should have been and said hey that’s where I live. He leaned closer adjusted his glasses and went very still. After a moment he said no that unit doesn’t exist. Not on any of our records.

I thought he was joking. He didn’t smile.

Back in my apartment everything looked normal. Same scuffed hardwood floors. Same leaky kitchen faucet. Same faint smell of dust and old paint that never quite went away. But once the idea was in my head I couldn’t shake it. I checked my lease. The address was there clear as day. Apartment number included. I checked my utility bills. Same thing. Even my mail had been arriving just fine. According to paperwork my apartment absolutely existed. According to the building map it didn’t.

That night I started noticing things I’d probably ignored before. The hallway outside my door seemed a little longer than I remembered. The lights flickered but only near my unit. When I stood very still I thought I could hear something behind the walls. Not pipes. Not mice. It sounded like breathing, slow and patient like whatever it was had nowhere else to be.

The next day I knocked on my neighbor’s door. I’d lived next to her for almost a year exchanged polite hellos borrowed sugar once. I asked her if she remembered when I moved in. She hesitated, eyes drifting past me down the hallway, and said she didn’t recall anyone living there before. When I told her I’d been there nearly twelve months, her face tightened. She said she thought the apartment was storage. Or maybe a maintenance access. She closed the door gently but firmly after that.

I started asking more questions. Too many questions apparently. One neighbor claimed the door to my apartment had been painted over years ago sealed shut after some kind of incident. Another said the unit number skipped straight past mine on the elevator panel though when I looked my floor button was right where it had always been. The building manager stopped answering my emails. When I went to the office again the door was locked during business hours.

Things inside the apartment began to shift. Subtle at first. A chair that wasn’t where I’d left it. Footprints in the dust near the baseboards barefoot and not mine. One morning, I woke up to find the front door unlocked, the deadbolt turned as if someone had left quietly in the night. I knew I hadn’t opened it. I sleep lightly. I would have heard it.

I tried to leave.

That’s when the building fought back.

The elevator wouldn’t stop on my floor anymore. It passed it every time skipping straight from the floor below to the one above. The stairwell door once I pushed through it opened onto a blank concrete wall. No hallway. No doors. Just solid gray cold and unyielding. When I turned around the stairwell behind me was gone. I don’t remember screaming but my throat hurt afterward so I must have.

I made it back to my apartment somehow. I don’t know how. The door was open waiting for me like it always had been.

That night, I found the map again. Not the one in the office. A different one. It was spread across my kitchen table when I got home yellowed and curled at the edges like it had been folded and unfolded for decades. It showed the building as it used to be. Older layout. Fewer safety features. And there clear as day, was my apartment. Not numbered. Just outlined in thick black ink tucked into a corner that didn’t quite fit the rest of the structure.

In the margins, someone had written notes. Warnings maybe. Or instructions. Most of them were scratched out so hard the paper had torn. One sentence was still legible.

This space fills itself.

I don’t decorate anymore. I don’t invite people over. I don’t make noise at night. I stay where the walls expect me to be. Sometimes I hear movement in rooms that shouldn’t exist doors opening where there are no doors. Sometimes I catch my reflection in the darkened TV screen standing just a second behind where I know I am.

My apartment still isn’t on the building map.

And I’m starting to understand why.",1,1769711475.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1qqgs78,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1qqgs78/dining_out_feels_cheaper_when_you_actually_get/,Dining out feels cheaper when you actually get money back,"But after paying a bit more attention over the last year, it’s surprising how much it adds up without changing habits at all.

Between credit cards, dining programs, rotating categories, and random bank offers, you can usually squeeze out **5–10% back** on meals if you’re paying attention. A **$60 dinner becoming $54** doesn’t feel life-changing in the moment, but over dozens of meals it quietly compounds.

The annoying part is the mental overhead. Different cards work at different restaurants, some offers need activation, some stack, some don’t. Half the time I’d just give up and swipe whatever card was already in my wallet.

Lately I’ve tried to reduce that friction. Instead of guessing, I’ll sometimes do a quick check on [**getsavewise**](https://getsavewise.com) or something similar just to see which option is decent before paying. Not trying to optimize perfectly — just avoid the worst choice.

One thing I’ve also noticed: a lot of people leave value on the table because they assume “cashback dining” means fancy restaurants or special portals. In reality, most of my returns come from completely normal places — takeout, casual spots, coffee, even fast food.

To be clear, this isn’t about eating out more. If anything, being more aware of spending makes me more intentional. But if the meal is already happening, getting a few dollars back feels like a small but satisfying win.

Curious how others here approach this:

* Do you actively rotate cards for dining?
* Use dining portals or just flat cashback?
* Or do you ignore it entirely and keep things simple?

Would love to hear what’s actually working for people in practice.",1,1769711461.0,CreditCards,0,1.0,False

About a year in the building was sold and Real Property Sterling took over the property management for the new owners. Our experience with them hasn’t been great. They consistently raise the rent where we are now paying $1350. On top of that they require we pay $35 a month for “membership perks”. To date I haven’t gotten a solid answer as to what that is beyond that it includes renters insurance and that it allows us to earn points with Piñata. The renters insurance is so bad I’ve had to buy my own. And in all that time I’ve only earned 600 points with Piñata which bought me a medium coffee at Dunkin. None the less it’s time to re-sign the lease and I was told they’d be increasing rent another $50 and that id have to pay a one time $75 fee to re-sign.

1qqgmx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qqgmx0/put_your_phone_away/,PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY,"A few months ago I noticed something kinda messed up. I was just overstimulated as fck all the time. Any tiny pause in my day and my phone was already in my hand and it got me tired at a point.

The worst part was how uncomfortable silence felt. Simple moments like waiting in line, walking or sitting alone for a minute felt extremely hard to do nothing. I always had that FOMO, so I would often check my phone in those times.

So I stopped trying to “use my phone less” and tried to fix my attention instead. I started watching podcasts (Cal Newport) and reading books (Dopamine Nation) that helped me get some ideas and methods to combat this addiction I had.

First thing, no phone for the first hour after waking up. No scrolling, no msgs, no news. Just coffee, moving around, letting my brain boot up. First week sucked. After that, mornings felt way less chaotic luckily.

Second, I only pick up my phone for one reason. If I open it to reply to someone, I reply and put it down. No reward scroll after. Sounds stupid but this one broke the autopilot loop hard.

Third, I replaced fast dopamine with slower stuff. Long walks with no podcast. Music without doing anything else. Writing random thoughts instead of checking apps. Way less exciting, but my brain calmed the fck down.

Fourth, I got clear on what I actually want to work toward. Once I had something real to build, scrolling felt way less tempting. Using stuff like Notion app and Purposa app helped me organize goals and focus on real progress.

Fifth, I pushed all the fun to night time. If I wanna scroll or watch dumb videos, fine. Just not all day. Knowing it’s there later makes it easier to not reach for it constantly.

At first everything felt boring as shit. Then slowly focus came back and now I can concentrate easily (obviously in tasks that I like haha)

Don’t think I am monk now and I don’t scroll anymore. I still scroll sometimes. I still waste time. But now my phone feels like a tool again, and that’s a relief for me. That alone changed way more than any productivity trick I ever tried.

What methods actually helped you use your phone less and use it in a more productive way? Would love to hear your methods/tools/apps!

Hope this helps you as it did for me, I wish all of you the best in this 2026!",1,1769711147.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

Wouldn’t they have crossed paths sooner in this small town? How long has his diner been a diner? Because it seems like Lorelai always would’ve gone there for coffee, even when Rory was small. When everyone knows everyone, it seems strange to me.

Also, how long was Rachel gone for before she came back? Wouldn’t Lorelai have known about her if she knew Luke for 9 years, or are we to believe he dated her 9 years ago and then she slides right back into his life? If not, how did Lorelai not know about her?

He’s in some ways super involved early on Like building the huppah for her wedding to Max, but Lorelai doesn’t know who he’s dated or about his sister? Idk. It just seems to not line up.

# Swiss Coffee OC-45 in Denver Country Club Historic Homes — Technical Guide from Local Pros

**Flair:** LOCAL SERVICES • HISTORIC HOMES • INTERIOR DESIGN • COLOR PALETTES  
**Area:** **Denver Country Club Historic District (80209)** 

For Denver homeowners in the Country Club and Cherry Creek North areas, paint color performance matters as much as appearance. At 5,280 feet, higher UV exposure and sharper light make flaws, undertones, and durability issues show faster—especially in historic plaster homes.

At **DAECO Painting (serving Denver since 2003)**, we’ve completed 400+ Swiss Coffee projects across central Denver. Benjamin Moore **Swiss Coffee OC-45** consistently delivers the most reliable results in these environments.

Here’s the practical breakdown:



# Why Swiss Coffee Works in Denver

* **LRV 82**: Brightens rooms without glare
* Warm undertone offsets Denver’s blue daylight
* Holds color better than gray-based whites under high UV
* Performs well in north, south, and west exposures

Cool whites often shift gray or feel institutional in Denver. Swiss Coffee maintains warmth and consistency over time.



# Prep Is Non-Negotiable (Especially in Historic Homes)

Proper results depend on preparation:

* HEPA dust extraction during sanding
* 180-grit surface profiling for adhesion
* High-hiding primer to neutralize legacy beige/gray

Skipping these steps leads to texture issues and premature wear—regardless of paint brand.



# Application by Surface

Each substrate requires a different system:

* **Walls / ceilings:** Benjamin Moore Regal Select Matte (precision roll)
* **Trim / doors:** Fine Paints of Europe Satin (airless spray)
* **Cabinetry:** HVLP fine finish for smooth, factory-grade results

This approach eliminates brush marks, lap lines, and early breakdown in high-traffic areas.



# Most Reliable Trim Pairings with Swiss Coffee

From our Denver projects:

* **White Dove OC-17** (most common)
* **Cloud White OC-130** (brighter option)
* **Decorator’s White OC-149** (maximum contrast, still warm)

We avoid pairing Swiss Coffee with ultra-cool whites like Chantilly Lace or Ultra Pure White—this is the main cause of “yellow wall” complaints.



# Recent Country Club Case (1927 Tudor)

* Swiss Coffee on walls
* White Dove on trim (Fine Paints of Europe Satin)
* Custom ceiling blend in low bedrooms
* HVLP cabinetry finish

Results after follow-up:

* Zero color callbacks
* Improved durability on original millwork
* Balanced light reflectance in north rooms

People are born into a world built only on destruction, forced to become another cog in the wheel of hell we call society. The ones we deem weak are cast aside into a never ending sea of shame and fear while the strongest thrive on their misery.

My father was a scientist. He worked in a secret laboratory tucked away in rural America, about 3 hours away from the nearest piece of civilization. I was never told about what he did at his job; I don’t think we were allowed to know. Sometimes he would come home reeking of vomit and formaldehyde. Sometimes he’d be angry or depressed about his ‘experiments’ going wrong; other times it was like he’d just won the lottery. My mother and I would be showered in gifts and treats while our questions about his work were brushed off with a wave of a hand.

Everyone in the lab disappeared when I was eight years old.

There was no trace, no clues, anything. There was only an empty building with floors covered in scattered notes and test tubes waiting to be used. They shut down the building after two weeks. My mother packed up what little we had and moved us across America to live with my grandparents. We never got our answers, we never got closure, we just ran. I spent years trying to learn what had happened. I would spend everyday researching the facility my father worked in, the people he worked with, the experiments they did. There was nothing. It was like everyone that worked there was wiped off the face of the earth, like they never even existed. Like they were nothing. I spent years looking for answers, looking for an explanation for why everyone disappeared and the entire site was abandoned… but there was nothing. I failed.

My mother was diagnosed with stage three stomach cancer when I was seventeen. She refused chemotherapy, something I still don’t understand, and spent her last days at home with her parents and a caretaker. I spent a lot of time away from home during that period and it was selfish. She needed me and I couldn’t bring myself to go near her, couldn’t stand the idea of seeing her in pain. So I kept my distance like a coward. A fool.

She was taking scheduled medicines, something my grandparents begged her to do to lessen the pain. On one of the rare occasions of me being home, I was convinced by my grandmother to wake her for her usual dosage. I walked up to the bed, turned on the lamp on the bedside table, and shook her shoulder.

“Mom, grandma said it’s time for your medicine.”

She didn’t say anything. I frowned and crouched beside the bed.

“Mom I know you don’t like it, but you gotta get up and take them. Then you can go right back to bed.”

Still, nothing. I rose from my crouching position and rolled her onto her back. Her eyes were shut, mouth just barely open, like she was in some deep sleep. I shook her again.

“Mom, wake up.”

Nothing. I shook a little harder.

“Mom.”

A heavy ball of anxiety formed in the pit of my stomach. I shook harder.

“Mom!”

Her body flailed against the bed.

“Mama you gotta wake up, please!”

I began to cry at the sight of her head lolling back and forth from the force, the way her arms lay limp at her sides. My grandfather had to pry me off her corpse when they came to see what was happening. All I could do was sob and thrash in his arms, screaming for her to wake up until my voice gave out and all I could let out were hoarse whimpers. The funeral was small. We cremated her.

I lived with my grandparents another three years before deciding to go through her stuff. It was just sitting in her old room collecting dust anyway. It was mainly furniture and old documents. My birth certificate, my parents marriage certificate, some old items from her childhood. I found some old necklaces and a ring in a little jewelry box. It had a silver band and a rose shaped charm over an amethyst. My mothers birthstone. Her wedding ring. I slipped it over my ring finger and kept sifting through boxes. There was one tucked away at the back of the pile; it was small and covered with dust. After managing to pull it out from under a pile of blankets, I split the tape with a pocket knife and opened it. It was a stack of books. Microbiology, engineering, chemistry, etc. At the top of the stack, placed so neatly in the middle of a botany book, was a photo.

It was my father.

He was standing in a nursery, hands curled around the bar of a white crib. His hair, a peppering of black and gray even at such a young age, was slicked back like it always used to be. He was wearing a sweater vest, a deep blue, which laid over a black pair of slacks. His wedding ring gleamed in the sunlight drifting in from the window to his left. The walls were painted a soft blue with little clouds and birds littering the part closest to the ceiling, leaving small snow tipped mountains at the bottom. I squinted at the bottom of the photo where I could see his pointer finger reaching into the crib from where he was holding it. And just barely in frame, a small hand, reaching out for the finger above. My breath hitched. My eyes blurred with tears. 

That was me. Me and my father. Before he was hired, before his time was consumed with experiments and late nights at the lab, before he disappeared from my life entirely.

I sobbed. I felt broken, hopeless. The two people I thought were going to be there for me till the end of time ended up leaving me with the broken remains of a life I never asked for. My fingers curled around the side of the frame, lifting the photo from the box. I stared at it, hand clenching until knuckles turned white and it shook from the force.

I threw it.

The photo hit the wall with a thump before falling to the ground with a sharp crack of glass. My shoulders slumped as I stared at the mess, glass scattered across the hardwood floor and photo peeking out from underneath the still intact brass frame. I broke it. Just like everything else I touch.

I crawled towards the frame, grabbing a trash bag on the way over. Settling on my knees beside it, I tugged open the bag before starting to pick up the broken shards one by one. A few of them scraped and stabbed against flesh, dripping blood down pale skin, but I kept going. The pain was okay. It was nice. Familiar. I continued to scoop up the broken pieces, dropping them into the bag and listening to the soft clinking sounds they made with each drop against another piece. I wasn’t paying much attention to where I was grabbing, I was sort of on autopilot. Just reaching and placing, the same movement of arm over and over again. But when my hand stopped over the trashcan and let go, there was no clink. There was no sound whatsoever. Instead, I felt something brush against my leg. Looking down, I saw it.

A note.

It was old paper, slightly beige and stained with a ring of coffee. Unfolding the paper, there was a large paragraph written in sloppy cursive. It took a while, but I managed to piece together what it said.

*There isn’t much time, my love. What we are doing in this place, the sins we’ve committed, they are catching up to us. George hasn’t been in the lab for weeks now and Alicia disappeared two days ago. People are being secretive and others have begun to go mad. This may be the last piece of contact between us. Please, take our boy and run far away before you meet the same fate as I.*

*I love you from the sun to the moon,*

*Walter*

A letter to my mother. Written so hastily like there was no time left for more. It was just a simple request. Leave. Leave and never come back to that horrid place where our lives seemed to end. My fathers disappearance and the disappearances of everyone he worked with wasn’t as simple as packing their bags and relocating without a word. Something had been after them. The government, a coworker, anything. Someone was responsible for this. Someone shattered my life and many others. They took my father from me, and I wasn’t going to let them get away with it for any longer.

The car rolled slowly into town as I looked briefly towards a sign on the side of the road. Coalfell is what it read. Thirty-nine hours later and I was finally here. I parked outside a general store that looked like it’d seen better days, and did a quick search through my backpack. I needed a flashlight, some water, and some snacks. Just enough to hold out for the next couple of days while I investigated the old lab.

Getting out of the car, I gave a brief nod to a family walking by and made my way into the store. The bell above the door gave a soft jingle as it opened and I noticed the burly man behind the counter looking up from the magazine he was browsing. He set it aside as I walked up to the counter.

“Morning. Do you have any flashlights? Maybe some batteries too..?”

“Flashlights? Maybe.. I’ll go check.”

“Thanks.”

As he walked off, I began to browse the shelves. I grabbed a few bags of chips and some candy bars, along with a couple water bottles and energy drinks. Just as I began to set everything on the counter, the man came back and set a flashlight down along with two packs of triple A batteries.

“Here y’are, son. Do you need anything else?”

“Uhm..” I did a quick look over the store before shaking my head “No, this is all.”

After giving a brief nod, the man started scanning the items and placing them in a plastic bag behind the counter. I rocked back and forth on the heels of my feet as I watched, eyes trained on the way he stuffed each item into the bag with little care.

“Hey.”

“Huh?” I looked up to see the man staring me down

“Don’t think I've seen you around here before.” He scanned a bag of chips “you vistin’ or somethin’?”

“Uh, yeah! Just- y’know.” I shrugged, looking down at tattered sneakers “vacation and stuff.”

“Don’t know why you chose this place.” he snorted “Ain’t shit to do ‘round here.”

I let out a small chuckle, shoulders raising in a shrug “just… memories, I guess. I used to live here when I was a kid.”

He gave another snort at that, placing the last few items into the bag before sliding it towards me. “Then welcome back.” he glanced at the register before looking back ""That'll be fifteen-sixty.”

I stuck my credit card into the machine, waiting a few seconds before pulling it back out when it beeped. Picking up the bag, I nodded at the man and smiled.

“Thank you Mr…” I squinted at his nametag “Otis.”

The corner of his lips turned upward as he shrugged “hey, it’s no problem. I hope you have a good day-” His hand waved for me to finish the sentence and I couldn't help but chuckle while turning away.

“Aristotle.”

The bell gave another jingle as I opened the door and left with a bit more pep in my step than I started out with; though it dissolved as I heard Otis whisper something about *‘Walters boy’* as the door shut behind me.

The sky had grown dark by the time I’d begun to make the drive to the lab. I’d spent the day booking a room at the local inn where the workers there gawked at me like some kind of freak after learning my name. The waitress at the diner I'd had supper in had done the same and I considered walking out on the bill at some point. But for what little time I was going to spend here, I wanted to make good impressions. 

But now it was just me, the road illuminated by the car's headlights, and the staticky country music spouting from the radio. Although it only took half an hour before I started switching through the channels for something more clear. By some miracle, the static finally shifted into the clear voice of a pastor.

“-iveness is not an excuse. Forgiveness is not forgetting. And forgiveness is not reconciling. Forgiveness is a decision given by the grace of God!”

A wolf howled in the distance to the moon hanging above; illuminating the dark forest lining the road to block it from sight. Like the road was a secret that no one may lay their gaze upon.

“Some hurts are far more serious and painful than a common argument, so we desire revenge. Forgiveness means giving that up because God is judge; not us.”

The pastor's voice slowly broke apart into static as the car drove deeper down the path. I cursed under my breath and started fiddling with the radio, eyes darting between it and the road. The atmosphere was creepy enough, I didn’t need total silence added to the mixture. But after two more minutes of complete static, I finally gave up and turned the radio off.

The silence was suffocating. 

And unfortunately for me; I was now alone with my thoughts.

*‘Why are you even doing this?’* That one popped up a lot. Probably because I can never find the answer.

*‘What would mom say if she saw you now?’* She’d probably be begging me to come back home; to give up on my father.

*‘What are you even going to say when you find him?’* I don’t know.

*‘What if you just crashed the car and ended this nonsense?’*

Okay. That one was new. I turned the radio back on and focused entirely on the static that filled the car. It actually started to feel peaceful. The loud buzzing blocked out the thoughts that tried to crawl up from the darkest chambers of my mind. The ones I refused to humor because If they were to be acknowledged, who knew what they’d make me do. So I welcomed the buzzing and even started to grow tired from the calming rhythm but just before my eyes could attempt to flutter shut, a scream broke through the trees. It was sharp and higher pitched. A woman.

I didn’t stop. What was I supposed to do? It was pitch black and who knows how many acres of forest between me and that woman. If I attempted to go after her, I'd probably meet whatever fate she had. So I whispered a prayer, and kept driving.

But karma has a funny way of catching up.

The headlights caught on a mound in the road and my foot stomped down on the brakes. The car screeched to a stop just before I could hit whatever was blocking the path. I couldn’t tell exactly what it was. Maybe a fallen tree? A wounded animal? Perhaps it was even that woman I'd heard earlier. Maybe she had escaped whatever she had encountered and made her way to the nearest sign of safety. My hand moved for the window. I was going to lower it, just a fraction, and call out. If it *was* a living being, it probably needed help. I could spare some time driving back to town. My finger pressed against the button. The window hissed.

The pile moved.

Slow at first; like it was taking a breath. Then it began to stretch out, one pawed hand digging into concrete as another pressed down to lift. It was big. A tall beast covered in graying fur that was darkened with an oozing red substance. A tail, almost five feet on its own and with the pattern of a skunk, drug along the floor as it began to turn towards the car. My breath caught as two pairs of eyes, glowing in the darkness, locked onto me through the windshield. It did nothing at first; just stared with elongated jaw gaping open and mouth dripping thick globs of saliva. Its nose twitched once. It’s head cocked.

It screamed. Sharp and deafening. A mimic of the one I had heard before.

The glass shattered.

The moon still hung above when I finally woke up, soft beams of light peeking through the various trees surrounding the area. I was laying in a sort of nest-like structure crafted from dead leaves, rotting branches, and bloody scraps of clothing. Lab coats.

I attempted to force myself up, only for a sharp pain to surge through my right leg and cause me to tumble back to the ground. My chest heaved with ragged breaths, one hand clutching at the front of my shirt. Something was broken, shattered, strained? It didn’t matter. What matters is that *something* was wrong and I was stuck here. My car was gone, my things were gone, my arms and face were punctured with glass fragments.

And there, just barely peeking out from behind a tree, were two pairs of eyes.

I attempted to get away, crawling backwards out of the nest as the creature drew closer. My hand, stained with the blood dripping down my arms, wrapped around a still intact branch to swing it forward and create a barrier between me and this monster.

“Stay back!” I shrieked while swinging my arm wildly, managing to hit the creature a few times on the head.

The beast reacted to the blows, though not in the way I expected. I was expecting an outburst, anger, to be attacked. But it didn’t attack. Instead, the creature took two steps back then lowered its head to the ground like a trained dog. The bottom pair of eyes, with Iris’s covering most of the sclera, darted between my face and the branch. The top pair, small and beady like humans, closed slowly. It was like the creature was trying to appear gentle; docile.

And forgive me for my idiocy; but I hesitated.

There was something about this submissive act, something about the way it just so easily *gave up,* that I couldn't stop thinking about. 

I lowered the branch and laid it carefully along my lap before raising my hands. I turned them side to side, showing that I no longer had a weapon. The creature blinked, gave a soft snort, then stood. One paw stepped forward in a testing motion, body freezing as if waiting for my permission to come closer. I nodded.

It came at me with more confidence, head lowered in a show of kindness. My shoulders trembled as its wet snout pressed briefly to the side of my neck before it pulled back to meet my gaze. Its jaw worked to open slowly, muscles pulling with sickening crackles and wet pops. I gagged as a long barbed tongue lolled out of its mouth, smelling of rotted flesh and chemicals. It took everything in me not to vomit as the appendage moved slowly to meet the flesh of my arm. The creature's tongue worked along bloodied skin, knocking out glass pieces with as gentle care as it could manage. Once one arm was done, it moved to work on the other. When both arms were done, it looked at me. I could see its eyes dart to the glass embedded in my cheeks. A brief whimper escaped me. I nodded.

Saliva smeared across my face as glass fragments were knocked out of skin and blood was licked clean. The creature knocked its head against mine once the work was done and I was declared healed, though it was quick to focus on my leg when it moved and I cried out in pain. It sniffed at the limb, snout pressing against fabric as low growls rumbled from deep within its chest. It huffed, turned, and fled.

At first I hadn’t even realized it was gone. I was so focused on wiping myself clean of its mouth fluids that I didn’t know it had disappeared until I finally looked up and realized I was alone.

“Hello?” I frowned, eyes scanning the trees.

Maybe it had lost interest in me and decided to find something better to do. Whatever reason it was, it gave me the perfect chance to escape. If I found the road again, I could follow it all the way back to town and warn everyone about what was out there in the forest.

My hands pressed against the grass beneath me, arms wobbling as I tried to force myself up. My shoes dug into the dirt for better balance and I managed to stand upright and take one wobbly step forward before falling to my knees.

“No! Get up you useless piece of shit!”

I tried again, stepped forward once, then fell. Curses fell from my mouth as I tried again and again, falling each time. My vision blurred with tears as I launched myself forward, arms reaching to grab onto *anything.* I fell.

And landed on the monster.

The beast gave a curious grunt as I landed on top of it, snout pressing into my stomach as my arms fell limp to dangle on either side of its head. I felt it move from beneath me, walking us back to the nest where it lowered so I could slide slowly back into the space. I lay limp now, staring silently at the creature hovering above me with twigs hanging from its jaw. The same twigs that were then dumped unceremoniously onto my chest before it sat back with light coos falling from hanging mouth. My hand moved to brush against one of the twigs and its tail noticeably began to wag in a fast pace. My hand moved away, and it stilled. Sitting up, I let the pile fall into my lap as eyes drifted to the abomination to my right.

“What is this?”

Its ears perked.

“Are you trying to bury me or something?”

A huff. Its snout nudged in the direction of my injured leg. I looked down at it, then the twigs, then the beast.

“This is for… my leg?”

It threw its head back for a cheerful howl, front paws pounding against the dirt beneath it. I let out an almost amused snort and brushed the twigs from off my lap. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t this demonic creature know how to make a makeshift cast?

It was watching me now so I made light work of straightening out my leg and checking the damages. It didn’t look broken, it was probably just a really bad sprain. Either way, I grabbed a few of the twigs and pressed them to each side of my leg. I held them for exactly ten seconds before letting out a sigh.

“I need something to secure them.”

The creature let out a soft growl of frustration, eyes scanning the nest as it began to walk around with its nose nudging against leaves and clothing. Soon, it bit down on a still intact lab coat and drug it over to lay it carefully over my leg.

“Thanks.” I mumbled while pulling it off and underneath my leg. “Press on these.” 

I tapped the twigs. It leaned in and pressed them into place with its snout. I held the other side with one hand as the other pulled one side of the coat over my leg then pulled up the other. Once I had a good grip, I shooed the creature away and began tying the coat with as tight of a knot as I could manage. Just as I was giving it one last tug, a card fell from one of the pockets. Curious, I picked it up and turned it over. It looked like some kind of keycard all the scientists used to wear. It had their name, age, and was used to access any part of the labs that weren’t restricted. My thumb brushed over the blood on the front to reveal the name beneath it.

Walter. This was my *fathers* card.

I gasped and the card fell from now trembling hands. Sensing the shift in the air, the creature moved in to peek at the card now laying in the dirt. Its ears shot upward, eyes glancing once in my direction before it grabbed it with sharp teeth.

I lunged.

The beast let out a whimper as I jumped onto it, body spinning in circles to shake me off like an annoying bug. But I persisted, hand grabbing at the other side of the card and pulling as hard as I could manage while my other arm remained looped around its neck. My feet dragged along the floor, heels digging in to try and form some kind of anchor.

“Give it back you bastard! I’ll kill you! What did you do to my father?!”

It stilled, mouth opening to drop the card. My arm loosened around its neck and I fell to the ground with a grunt before forcing myself up on shaky legs.

“Fuck you.” I growled while pointing a finger at it. It whimpered and sat back.

With an angry huff, I turned and began limping my way out of the small clearing and hopefully in the direction of the road. And if it wasn’t the road? That’s fine. There had to be an end to this forest at some point.

“Fa…”

I froze. Turned. It was sitting there, exactly where I had left it. Its mouth hung open and I could see its tongue working to form words.

“Fa-ath.”

I dropped to my knees in shock, nodding along as it tried to let out one single word.

“Fath…her–”

A noise left me, something between a gasp and a cry. Hands moved to fist into hair as I nodded rapidly towards it.

“Y-yes. My father– What happened to my father?”

It shifted, huffed, and tried again.

“Art…tie.”

My mind blanked. Artie. That’s what my father used to call me. 

The creature stood now, bones giving soft pops as it strode forward. Once close, it leaned in and pressed its snout to my forehead.

“Artiiiie…”

I started to cry now, hands falling from hair to tremble in the air on either side of the monster's face. Its head lolled, dipping into my hand and rubbing matted fur against soft palm. My breath hitched with a sob.

*“Dad?*”

The beast froze for only a second, chest rumbling with an almost sad growl. Then it shifted, tongue moving to lick gently up the side of my face in slow motions, catching my tears. I could only sit there and cry, hands brushing against the matted fur of the monster that had once been my parent.

“Oh dad… what did you do?”

A whimper escaped my father as he pulled back with his head hanging in shame. The message was clear. He did this to himself. Maybe an experiment went wrong or, perhaps he even *wanted* to do this to himself. Looking at the sadness in those mutated eyes, I don’t think it was the second option.

“Dad?” I reached out, petting a hand against the fur on the top of his head. “What happened to everyone?”

Another whimper. He pulled back, turned, and howled. Off in the distance just beyond the forest, another one echoed out. My breath caught as it rang out for a few seconds longer before the world fell silent around us. My father peeked at me and gave a short huff. I frowned. Everyone was still out there, possibly turned into more of these creatures. Those experiments they were doing… the way my father smelt whenever he’d return home. It was ungodly acts they committed in that building, but no one deserved a fate like this.

I stood, wobbling slightly on my right leg, then reached out to press my hands to the fur on my fathers back.

People are born into a world built only on destruction, forced to become another cog in the wheel of hell we call society. The ones we deem weak are cast aside into a never ending sea of shame and fear while the strongest thrive on their misery.

My father was a scientist. He worked in a secret laboratory tucked away in rural America, about 3 hours away from the nearest piece of civilization. I was never told about what he did at his job; I don’t think we were allowed to know. Sometimes he would come home reeking of vomit and formaldehyde. Sometimes he’d be angry or depressed about his ‘experiments’ going wrong; other times it was like he’d just won the lottery. My mother and I would be showered in gifts and treats while our questions about his work were brushed off with a wave of a hand.

Everyone in the lab disappeared when I was eight years old.

There was no trace, no clues, anything. There was only an empty building with floors covered in scattered notes and test tubes waiting to be used. They shut down the building after two weeks. My mother packed up what little we had and moved us across America to live with my grandparents. We never got our answers, we never got closure, we just ran. I spent years trying to learn what had happened. I would spend everyday researching the facility my father worked in, the people he worked with, the experiments they did. There was nothing. It was like everyone that worked there was wiped off the face of the earth, like they never even existed. Like they were nothing. I spent years looking for answers, looking for an explanation for why everyone disappeared and the entire site was abandoned… but there was nothing. I failed.

My mother was diagnosed with stage three stomach cancer when I was seventeen. She refused chemotherapy, something I still don’t understand, and spent her last days at home with her parents and a caretaker. I spent a lot of time away from home during that period and it was selfish. She needed me and I couldn’t bring myself to go near her, couldn’t stand the idea of seeing her in pain. So I kept my distance like a coward. A fool.

She was taking scheduled medicines, something my grandparents begged her to do to lessen the pain. On one of the rare occasions of me being home, I was convinced by my grandmother to wake her for her usual dosage. I walked up to the bed, turned on the lamp on the bedside table, and shook her shoulder.

“Mom, grandma said it’s time for your medicine.”

She didn’t say anything. I frowned and crouched beside the bed.

“Mom I know you don’t like it, but you gotta get up and take them. Then you can go right back to bed.”

Still, nothing. I rose from my crouching position and rolled her onto her back. Her eyes were shut, mouth just barely open, like she was in some deep sleep. I shook her again.

“Mom, wake up.”

Nothing. I shook a little harder.

“Mom.”

A heavy ball of anxiety formed in the pit of my stomach. I shook harder.

“Mom!”

Her body flailed against the bed.

“Mama you gotta wake up, please!”

I began to cry at the sight of her head lolling back and forth from the force, the way her arms lay limp at her sides. My grandfather had to pry me off her corpse when they came to see what was happening. All I could do was sob and thrash in his arms, screaming for her to wake up until my voice gave out and all I could let out were hoarse whimpers. The funeral was small. We cremated her.

I lived with my grandparents another three years before deciding to go through her stuff. It was just sitting in her old room collecting dust anyway. It was mainly furniture and old documents. My birth certificate, my parents marriage certificate, some old items from her childhood. I found some old necklaces and a ring in a little jewelry box. It had a silver band and a rose shaped charm over an amethyst. My mothers birthstone. Her wedding ring. I slipped it over my ring finger and kept sifting through boxes. There was one tucked away at the back of the pile; it was small and covered with dust. After managing to pull it out from under a pile of blankets, I split the tape with a pocket knife and opened it. It was a stack of books. Microbiology, engineering, chemistry, etc. At the top of the stack, placed so neatly in the middle of a botany book, was a photo.

It was my father.

He was standing in a nursery, hands curled around the bar of a white crib. His hair, a peppering of black and gray even at such a young age, was slicked back like it always used to be. He was wearing a sweater vest, a deep blue, which laid over a black pair of slacks. His wedding ring gleamed in the sunlight drifting in from the window to his left. The walls were painted a soft blue with little clouds and birds littering the part closest to the ceiling, leaving small snow tipped mountains at the bottom. I squinted at the bottom of the photo where I could see his pointer finger reaching into the crib from where he was holding it. And just barely in frame, a small hand, reaching out for the finger above. My breath hitched. My eyes blurred with tears. 

That was me. Me and my father. Before he was hired, before his time was consumed with experiments and late nights at the lab, before he disappeared from my life entirely.

I sobbed. I felt broken, hopeless. The two people I thought were going to be there for me till the end of time ended up leaving me with the broken remains of a life I never asked for. My fingers curled around the side of the frame, lifting the photo from the box. I stared at it, hand clenching until knuckles turned white and it shook from the force.

I threw it.

The photo hit the wall with a thump before falling to the ground with a sharp crack of glass. My shoulders slumped as I stared at the mess, glass scattered across the hardwood floor and photo peeking out from underneath the still intact brass frame. I broke it. Just like everything else I touch.

I crawled towards the frame, grabbing a trash bag on the way over. Settling on my knees beside it, I tugged open the bag before starting to pick up the broken shards one by one. A few of them scraped and stabbed against flesh, dripping blood down pale skin, but I kept going. The pain was okay. It was nice. Familiar. I continued to scoop up the broken pieces, dropping them into the bag and listening to the soft clinking sounds they made with each drop against another piece. I wasn’t paying much attention to where I was grabbing, I was sort of on autopilot. Just reaching and placing, the same movement of arm over and over again. But when my hand stopped over the trashcan and let go, there was no clink. There was no sound whatsoever. Instead, I felt something brush against my leg. Looking down, I saw it.

A note.

It was old paper, slightly beige and stained with a ring of coffee. Unfolding the paper, there was a large paragraph written in sloppy cursive. It took a while, but I managed to piece together what it said.

*There isn’t much time, my love. What we are doing in this place, the sins we’ve committed, they are catching up to us. George hasn’t been in the lab for weeks now and Alicia disappeared two days ago. People are being secretive and others have begun to go mad. This may be the last piece of contact between us. Please, take our boy and run far away before you meet the same fate as I.*

*I love you from the sun to the moon,*

*Walter*

A letter to my mother. Written so hastily like there was no time left for more. It was just a simple request. Leave. Leave and never come back to that horrid place where our lives seemed to end. My fathers disappearance and the disappearances of everyone he worked with wasn’t as simple as packing their bags and relocating without a word. Something had been after them. The government, a coworker, anything. Someone was responsible for this. Someone shattered my life and many others. They took my father from me, and I wasn’t going to let them get away with it for any longer.

The car rolled slowly into town as I looked briefly towards a sign on the side of the road. Coalfell is what it read. Thirty-nine hours later and I was finally here. I parked outside a general store that looked like it’d seen better days, and did a quick search through my backpack. I needed a flashlight, some water, and some snacks. Just enough to hold out for the next couple of days while I investigated the old lab.

Getting out of the car, I gave a brief nod to a family walking by and made my way into the store. The bell above the door gave a soft jingle as it opened and I noticed the burly man behind the counter looking up from the magazine he was browsing. He set it aside as I walked up to the counter.

“Morning. Do you have any flashlights? Maybe some batteries too..?”

“Flashlights? Maybe.. I’ll go check.”

“Thanks.”

As he walked off, I began to browse the shelves. I grabbed a few bags of chips and some candy bars, along with a couple water bottles and energy drinks. Just as I began to set everything on the counter, the man came back and set a flashlight down along with two packs of triple A batteries.

“Here y’are, son. Do you need anything else?”

“Uhm..” I did a quick look over the store before shaking my head “No, this is all.”

After giving a brief nod, the man started scanning the items and placing them in a plastic bag behind the counter. I rocked back and forth on the heels of my feet as I watched, eyes trained on the way he stuffed each item into the bag with little care.

“Hey.”

“Huh?” I looked up to see the man staring me down

“Don’t think I've seen you around here before.” He scanned a bag of chips “you vistin’ or somethin’?”

“Uh, yeah! Just- y’know.” I shrugged, looking down at tattered sneakers “vacation and stuff.”

“Don’t know why you chose this place.” he snorted “Ain’t shit to do ‘round here.”

I let out a small chuckle, shoulders raising in a shrug “just… memories, I guess. I used to live here when I was a kid.”

He gave another snort at that, placing the last few items into the bag before sliding it towards me. “Then welcome back.” he glanced at the register before looking back ""That'll be fifteen-sixty.”

I stuck my credit card into the machine, waiting a few seconds before pulling it back out when it beeped. Picking up the bag, I nodded at the man and smiled.

“Thank you Mr…” I squinted at his nametag “Otis.”

The corner of his lips turned upward as he shrugged “hey, it’s no problem. I hope you have a good day-” His hand waved for me to finish the sentence and I couldn't help but chuckle while turning away.

“Aristotle.”

The bell gave another jingle as I opened the door and left with a bit more pep in my step than I started out with; though it dissolved as I heard Otis whisper something about *‘Walters boy’* as the door shut behind me.

The sky had grown dark by the time I’d begun to make the drive to the lab. I’d spent the day booking a room at the local inn where the workers there gawked at me like some kind of freak after learning my name. The waitress at the diner I'd had supper in had done the same and I considered walking out on the bill at some point. But for what little time I was going to spend here, I wanted to make good impressions. 

But now it was just me, the road illuminated by the car's headlights, and the staticky country music spouting from the radio. Although it only took half an hour before I started switching through the channels for something more clear. By some miracle, the static finally shifted into the clear voice of a pastor.

“-iveness is not an excuse. Forgiveness is not forgetting. And forgiveness is not reconciling. Forgiveness is a decision given by the grace of God!”

A wolf howled in the distance to the moon hanging above; illuminating the dark forest lining the road to block it from sight. Like the road was a secret that no one may lay their gaze upon.

“Some hurts are far more serious and painful than a common argument, so we desire revenge. Forgiveness means giving that up because God is judge; not us.”

The pastor's voice slowly broke apart into static as the car drove deeper down the path. I cursed under my breath and started fiddling with the radio, eyes darting between it and the road. The atmosphere was creepy enough, I didn’t need total silence added to the mixture. But after two more minutes of complete static, I finally gave up and turned the radio off.

The silence was suffocating. 

And unfortunately for me; I was now alone with my thoughts.

*‘Why are you even doing this?’* That one popped up a lot. Probably because I can never find the answer.

*‘What would mom say if she saw you now?’* She’d probably be begging me to come back home; to give up on my father.

*‘What are you even going to say when you find him?’* I don’t know.

*‘What if you just crashed the car and ended this nonsense?’*

Okay. That one was new. I turned the radio back on and focused entirely on the static that filled the car. It actually started to feel peaceful. The loud buzzing blocked out the thoughts that tried to crawl up from the darkest chambers of my mind. The ones I refused to humor because If they were to be acknowledged, who knew what they’d make me do. So I welcomed the buzzing and even started to grow tired from the calming rhythm but just before my eyes could attempt to flutter shut, a scream broke through the trees. It was sharp and higher pitched. A woman.

I didn’t stop. What was I supposed to do? It was pitch black and who knows how many acres of forest between me and that woman. If I attempted to go after her, I'd probably meet whatever fate she had. So I whispered a prayer, and kept driving.

But karma has a funny way of catching up.

The headlights caught on a mound in the road and my foot stomped down on the brakes. The car screeched to a stop just before I could hit whatever was blocking the path. I couldn’t tell exactly what it was. Maybe a fallen tree? A wounded animal? Perhaps it was even that woman I'd heard earlier. Maybe she had escaped whatever she had encountered and made her way to the nearest sign of safety. My hand moved for the window. I was going to lower it, just a fraction, and call out. If it *was* a living being, it probably needed help. I could spare some time driving back to town. My finger pressed against the button. The window hissed.

The pile moved.

Slow at first; like it was taking a breath. Then it began to stretch out, one pawed hand digging into concrete as another pressed down to lift. It was big. A tall beast covered in graying fur that was darkened with an oozing red substance. A tail, almost five feet on its own and with the pattern of a skunk, drug along the floor as it began to turn towards the car. My breath caught as two pairs of eyes, glowing in the darkness, locked onto me through the windshield. It did nothing at first; just stared with elongated jaw gaping open and mouth dripping thick globs of saliva. Its nose twitched once. It’s head cocked.

It screamed. Sharp and deafening. A mimic of the one I had heard before.

The glass shattered.

The moon still hung above when I finally woke up, soft beams of light peeking through the various trees surrounding the area. I was laying in a sort of nest-like structure crafted from dead leaves, rotting branches, and bloody scraps of clothing. Lab coats.

I attempted to force myself up, only for a sharp pain to surge through my right leg and cause me to tumble back to the ground. My chest heaved with ragged breaths, one hand clutching at the front of my shirt. Something was broken, shattered, strained? It didn’t matter. What matters is that *something* was wrong and I was stuck here. My car was gone, my things were gone, my arms and face were punctured with glass fragments.

And there, just barely peeking out from behind a tree, were two pairs of eyes.

I attempted to get away, crawling backwards out of the nest as the creature drew closer. My hand, stained with the blood dripping down my arms, wrapped around a still intact branch to swing it forward and create a barrier between me and this monster.

“Stay back!” I shrieked while swinging my arm wildly, managing to hit the creature a few times on the head.

The beast reacted to the blows, though not in the way I expected. I was expecting an outburst, anger, to be attacked. But it didn’t attack. Instead, the creature took two steps back then lowered its head to the ground like a trained dog. The bottom pair of eyes, with Iris’s covering most of the sclera, darted between my face and the branch. The top pair, small and beady like humans, closed slowly. It was like the creature was trying to appear gentle; docile.

And forgive me for my idiocy; but I hesitated.

There was something about this submissive act, something about the way it just so easily *gave up,* that I couldn't stop thinking about. 

I lowered the branch and laid it carefully along my lap before raising my hands. I turned them side to side, showing that I no longer had a weapon. The creature blinked, gave a soft snort, then stood. One paw stepped forward in a testing motion, body freezing as if waiting for my permission to come closer. I nodded.

It came at me with more confidence, head lowered in a show of kindness. My shoulders trembled as its wet snout pressed briefly to the side of my neck before it pulled back to meet my gaze. Its jaw worked to open slowly, muscles pulling with sickening crackles and wet pops. I gagged as a long barbed tongue lolled out of its mouth, smelling of rotted flesh and chemicals. It took everything in me not to vomit as the appendage moved slowly to meet the flesh of my arm. The creature's tongue worked along bloodied skin, knocking out glass pieces with as gentle care as it could manage. Once one arm was done, it moved to work on the other. When both arms were done, it looked at me. I could see its eyes dart to the glass embedded in my cheeks. A brief whimper escaped me. I nodded.

Saliva smeared across my face as glass fragments were knocked out of skin and blood was licked clean. The creature knocked its head against mine once the work was done and I was declared healed, though it was quick to focus on my leg when it moved and I cried out in pain. It sniffed at the limb, snout pressing against fabric as low growls rumbled from deep within its chest. It huffed, turned, and fled.

At first I hadn’t even realized it was gone. I was so focused on wiping myself clean of its mouth fluids that I didn’t know it had disappeared until I finally looked up and realized I was alone.

“Hello?” I frowned, eyes scanning the trees.

Maybe it had lost interest in me and decided to find something better to do. Whatever reason it was, it gave me the perfect chance to escape. If I found the road again, I could follow it all the way back to town and warn everyone about what was out there in the forest.

My hands pressed against the grass beneath me, arms wobbling as I tried to force myself up. My shoes dug into the dirt for better balance and I managed to stand upright and take one wobbly step forward before falling to my knees.

“No! Get up you useless piece of shit!”

I tried again, stepped forward once, then fell. Curses fell from my mouth as I tried again and again, falling each time. My vision blurred with tears as I launched myself forward, arms reaching to grab onto *anything.* I fell.

And landed on the monster.

The beast gave a curious grunt as I landed on top of it, snout pressing into my stomach as my arms fell limp to dangle on either side of its head. I felt it move from beneath me, walking us back to the nest where it lowered so I could slide slowly back into the space. I lay limp now, staring silently at the creature hovering above me with twigs hanging from its jaw. The same twigs that were then dumped unceremoniously onto my chest before it sat back with light coos falling from hanging mouth. My hand moved to brush against one of the twigs and its tail noticeably began to wag in a fast pace. My hand moved away, and it stilled. Sitting up, I let the pile fall into my lap as eyes drifted to the abomination to my right.

“What is this?”

Its ears perked.

“Are you trying to bury me or something?”

A huff. Its snout nudged in the direction of my injured leg. I looked down at it, then the twigs, then the beast.

“This is for… my leg?”

It threw its head back for a cheerful howl, front paws pounding against the dirt beneath it. I let out an almost amused snort and brushed the twigs from off my lap. Of course it was. Why wouldn’t this demonic creature know how to make a makeshift cast?

It was watching me now so I made light work of straightening out my leg and checking the damages. It didn’t look broken, it was probably just a really bad sprain. Either way, I grabbed a few of the twigs and pressed them to each side of my leg. I held them for exactly ten seconds before letting out a sigh.

“I need something to secure them.”

The creature let out a soft growl of frustration, eyes scanning the nest as it began to walk around with its nose nudging against leaves and clothing. Soon, it bit down on a still intact lab coat and drug it over to lay it carefully over my leg.

“Thanks.” I mumbled while pulling it off and underneath my leg. “Press on these.” 

I tapped the twigs. It leaned in and pressed them into place with its snout. I held the other side with one hand as the other pulled one side of the coat over my leg then pulled up the other. Once I had a good grip, I shooed the creature away and began tying the coat with as tight of a knot as I could manage. Just as I was giving it one last tug, a card fell from one of the pockets. Curious, I picked it up and turned it over. It looked like some kind of keycard all the scientists used to wear. It had their name, age, and was used to access any part of the labs that weren’t restricted. My thumb brushed over the blood on the front to reveal the name beneath it.

Walter. This was my *fathers* card.

I gasped and the card fell from now trembling hands. Sensing the shift in the air, the creature moved in to peek at the card now laying in the dirt. Its ears shot upward, eyes glancing once in my direction before it grabbed it with sharp teeth.

I lunged.

The beast let out a whimper as I jumped onto it, body spinning in circles to shake me off like an annoying bug. But I persisted, hand grabbing at the other side of the card and pulling as hard as I could manage while my other arm remained looped around its neck. My feet dragged along the floor, heels digging in to try and form some kind of anchor.

“Give it back you bastard! I’ll kill you! What did you do to my father?!”

It stilled, mouth opening to drop the card. My arm loosened around its neck and I fell to the ground with a grunt before forcing myself up on shaky legs.

“Fuck you.” I growled while pointing a finger at it. It whimpered and sat back.

With an angry huff, I turned and began limping my way out of the small clearing and hopefully in the direction of the road. And if it wasn’t the road? That’s fine. There had to be an end to this forest at some point.

“Fa…”

I froze. Turned. It was sitting there, exactly where I had left it. Its mouth hung open and I could see its tongue working to form words.

“Fa-ath.”

I dropped to my knees in shock, nodding along as it tried to let out one single word.

“Fath…her–”

A noise left me, something between a gasp and a cry. Hands moved to fist into hair as I nodded rapidly towards it.

“Y-yes. My father– What happened to my father?”

It shifted, huffed, and tried again.

“Art…tie.”

My mind blanked. Artie. That’s what my father used to call me. 

The creature stood now, bones giving soft pops as it strode forward. Once close, it leaned in and pressed its snout to my forehead.

“Artiiiie…”

I started to cry now, hands falling from hair to tremble in the air on either side of the monster's face. Its head lolled, dipping into my hand and rubbing matted fur against soft palm. My breath hitched with a sob.

*“Dad?*”

The beast froze for only a second, chest rumbling with an almost sad growl. Then it shifted, tongue moving to lick gently up the side of my face in slow motions, catching my tears. I could only sit there and cry, hands brushing against the matted fur of the monster that had once been my parent.

“Oh dad… what did you do?”

A whimper escaped my father as he pulled back with his head hanging in shame. The message was clear. He did this to himself. Maybe an experiment went wrong or, perhaps he even *wanted* to do this to himself. Looking at the sadness in those mutated eyes, I don’t think it was the second option.

“Dad?” I reached out, petting a hand against the fur on the top of his head. “What happened to everyone?”

Another whimper. He pulled back, turned, and howled. Off in the distance just beyond the forest, another one echoed out. My breath caught as it rang out for a few seconds longer before the world fell silent around us. My father peeked at me and gave a short huff. I frowned. Everyone was still out there, possibly turned into more of these creatures. Those experiments they were doing… the way my father smelt whenever he’d return home. It was ungodly acts they committed in that building, but no one deserved a fate like this.

I stood, wobbling slightly on my right leg, then reached out to press my hands to the fur on my fathers back.

NORTH rich, famous and potentially powerful. But for many of the officials, spies and subordinates caught up in the scandal, the last seven years have brought little but bitterness.

Some charged with crimes pleaded guilty. Some fought the law and lost. Some won Presidential pardons. Almost all are unrepentant.

Others, never charged with crimes, have nonetheless had to live with notoriety.

Three years ago Mr. North, a National Security Council aide in the Reagan White House, won a Federal appeals court reversal of his felony convictions. Always politically conservative, he is now seeking the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat in Virginia. He has also earned about $2 million from speeches and books, and he has moved to a fine old country house far up the Potomac River from Washington.

Few who worked with him have fared so well. Here is what has become of them.

The Iran-contra affair began to unfold in October 1986, when the Nicaraguan Army captured EUGENE HASENFUS , a construction worker and part-time mercenary. Mr. Hasenfus was a foot soldier in Mr. North's network of assistance to the rebels, or contras, who in the 1980's were fighting a leftist Government in Nicaragua.

Mr. Hasenfus was a ""kicker"" who shoved cargo out of airplanes to resupply the contras. After one plane was shot down over Nicaragua in 1986 with Mr. Hasenfus aboard, his captors sentenced him to decades in prison. They soon let him go, but not before his plight began drawing attention to shadowy operations supporting the contras.

Soon the nation learned that those operations, directed by the White House in defiance of Congress, had been financed in part with millions of dollars from the Reagan Administration's covert sale of arms to Iran.

Mr. Hasenfus hoped the Government might cover his legal fees, pay him for his trouble. But no one even said thanks, and now he is bitter.

""We're still barely keeping our heads above water,"" he said of himself and his family in an interview from his home in Wisconsin. ""Everything's still the same. I'm still working construction.""

To RICHARD V. SECORD , a retired Air Force major general who put together a global network of companies to run guns for the White House, the whole affair was ""just a pack of lies and counterlies and distortions, and it started out that way with President Reagan saying he knew nothing about it.""

Mr. Secord pleaded guilty to misleading Congress and still has legal problems. The Justice Department is suing him for millions of dollars left over from the arms sales, money that sits in a Swiss bank account. He runs a small company outside Washington that helps oil companies market their products abroad.

CLAIR E. GEORGE , former chief of covert operations for the Central Intelligence Agency, was charged with lying to Congress about his knowledge of the contra supply operation. He was tried, convicted and then, a year ago, pardoned by President George Bush.

Mr. George, now an international business consultant, remains angry. ""The lesson,"" he said, ""is that your government will not stand behind you when trouble comes your way.""

ALAN D. FIERS , former chief of the C.I.A.'s Latin America task force, pleaded guilty to misleading Congress and tearfully testified against Mr. George, once his superior and friend. Mr. Fiers, now president of Grace Thermal and Emission Control Systems, in De Pere, Wis., says he would just as soon forget the entire matter. He calls the issuance of the Iran-contra report ""the final chapter.""

If so, said ELLIOTT L. ABRAMS , ""I'm glad it's over, and I actually don't think there's anyone else in America who isn't glad too.""

Mr. Abrams, the Reagan Administration's Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs, was always the most pugnacious of the defendants. If he has mellowed, it is hard to tell. The special prosecutor, he said in an interview, ""created a Frankenstein's monster that refused to die.""

In his book about the affair, ""Undue Process"" (Free Press, 1992), Mr. Abrams rages at his enemies, calling them ""filthy bastards"" and ""bloodsuckers.""

Mr. Abrams pleaded guilty of withholding information from Congress but was pardoned by Mr. Bush. The legal and political battles cost him dearly, although he says a defense fund absorbed most of his legal expenses. Now he is fighting an effort to suspend him from the bar in Washington, and is finishing another book, on American foreign policy.

FAWN HALL , Mr. North's secretary and, in crisis, his document-shredder, moved to Los Angeles and dabbled in television journalism. In April she married Danny Sugerman, once a member of the retinue of the Doors, the 1960's rock band. Mr. Sugerman was co-author of a best-selling book, ""No One Gets Out of Here Alive"" (Warner Books, 1980), about the band's singer, Jim Morrison.

For DONALD P. GREGG , the Iran-contra affair and its aftermath have been akin to ""living with snakes in the cellar for seven years."" Mr. Gregg, a former C.I.A. official, was Vice President George Bush's national security adviser in 1986. He was never charged with wrongdoing, but after Federal agents administered a lie-detector test on him in 1990, ""that unleashed the dogs,"" he said.

""They started all over again, trying to sink their talons into me,"" he said. ""I assume they felt that through me they thought they could get to President Bush."" Mr. Gregg was Ambassador to South Korea in the Bush Administration and now heads the Korea Society, which promotes cultural exchanges.

ROBERT C. DUTTON , a retired Air Force colonel who supervised Mr. North's private air corps, was also investigated without being charged. Last month a Federal appeals court ruled that the Government had to pay $39,946 for his legal expenses.

The Iran-contra affair ""took a few years out of my life,"" he said. ""I like to have positive, long-range goals, but I had to deal with things day by day. And before you knew it, a couple of years had gone by.""

Today Mr. Dutton is an international broker for pharmaceutical companies.

ROBERT C. McFARLANE , national security adviser in the Reagan White House, says he's ""sad and wiser, maybe.""

""I'm not mad about it anymore,"" he said. ""Inured, I guess, is what I am.""

Mr. McFarlane, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges and was pardoned by Mr. Bush, now says that during the Iran-contra inquiries, he declined to battle investigators because he thought he might come out ahead by cooperating. He calls his thinking back then ""quite stupid.""

In 1987, Mr. McFarlane attempted suicide with an overdose of Valium.

He is a businessman now, trying to make utility and energy deals, mostly in Southeast Asia. ""I started out as a consultant,"" he said, ""but I didn't like it. I'd advise companies what to do in a given country. They'd do it and make a lot of money, and I wouldn't.""JOHN M. POINDEXTER , who succeeded Mr. McFarlane as national security adviser, all but disappeared from public view after he was convicted in April 1990 of obstructing Congressional inquiries. A Federal appeals court overturned the conviction in 1991.

He and a colleague started a small software development company.

What little time he spends these days thinking about the Iran-contra affair, he said, still brings anger at Mr. Walsh. ""The problem is,"" Mr. Poindexter said, ""that he had this theory he was trying so hard to prove"" -- that President Reagan was culpable -- ""and it was never correct in the first place."" Mr. Poindexter also remains ""upset with the hypocrisy of Congress.""

As for himself, he said: ""I enjoyed my years in the White House. And if I had it to do over again, I would probably do things just about exactly the same way I did them.""

Former Secretary of State GEORGE P. SHULTZ lectures, golfs, writes and sits on corporate boards. He opposed the arms sales to Iran, but Mr. Walsh announced in 1991 that Mr. Shultz was under investigation. Nothing came of that, and early this month a Federal court ruled that the Government must pay Mr. Shultz's legal fees of $281,000.

Mr. Shultz won a $2 million advance for his memoirs and the promise of a second book, on foreign policy. He works at the Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, at Stanford University.

Also at the Hoover Institution, as a distinguished visiting fellow, is former Attorney General EDWIN MEESE 3d . But he spends most of his time at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization in Washington, where he holds the Ronald Reagan Chair in Public Policy. Mr. Meese's memoirs, ""With Reagan"" (Regnery Gateway, 1992), was not widely reviewed or well received.

Mr. Meese, who was severely criticized in Mr. Walsh's report, politely but firmly declined to comment on the affair.

Former President GEORGE BUSH says he's ""very, very happy"" in retirement, helping his wife, Barbara, decorate their new home in Houston. ""I do the windows and coffee,"" he said. In London this month, he was awarded an honorary knighthood.

Mr. Bush gives speeches, raising money for his Presidential library, and is reportedly writing a book. Since leaving office he had little to say about the Iran-contra affair. He contended all along that he was ""out of the loop"" when decisions that led to the scandal were made by President Reagan's aides.

Still, several former assistants have said Mr. Bush was more involved than he has acknowledged. Mr. Shultz wrote that he had been ""astonished"" to hear Mr. Bush's claim.

One of Mr. Bush's last acts as President was to pardon Messrs. Abrams, Fiers, George and McFarlane, as well as former Defense Secretary CASPAR W. WEINBERGER and DUANE R. CLARRIDGE , a former senior C.I.A. officer. Today Mr. Clarridge, who like Mr. Weinberger was indicted but never tried, is an executive at General Dynamics, the military contractor, in San Diego. Mr. Weinberger is publisher of Forbes magazine and relaxes at Windswept, his Maine estate.

RONALD REAGAN lives in very private retirement in California. He travels occasionally but otherwise keeps out of public view. His most visible activity since leaving the Presidency in 1989 has been the publication of ""An American Life"" (Simon & Schuster, 1990), an autobiography filled with familiar Reagan homilies.

All along Mr. Reagan professed not to recall critical Iran-contra events, including his own decisions. He is now 82, and some people who know him say his memory is failing. Like many other Americans, he appears to have forgotten much about the worst scandal of his Presidency.",1,1769710517.0,IranContra,0,1.0,False

I do some virtual coffee chats etc. with some other coworkers who were complaining about Adam and calling him a slacker. 

The thing is, I've worked with Adam in the past on another team, and he was like a completely different person at that time: totally upbeat/curious, productive, and easy to work with. I know he had a close family member pass away within the last year and there have been a lot of changes and even interpersonal drama at my company that have been stressing people out. When I knew him in the past, he seemed a bit shy and not like someone who would seems like they would be very vocal if they were struggling. 

I think it's possible that Adam being unproductive is not really due to him just ""being a slacker"", but that he is experiencing something with his mental health or having difficulty recovering from all the changes and drama that have happened at my company. We don't really have a relationship where we do virtual coffee/hangouts at work, but I want to do something that could let him know that I recognise he is a human being outside of work and that he might be going through a hard time.

1qqg8rx,https://v.redd.it/4wj6jmocxbgg1,I build a simple protein tracker that is not free but hear me out why…,"I’m Archie, the builder of Protin.

I want to be very honest about why I built another protein tracker — and why it’s not free.

I’m a sports enthusiast and I’m currently training for my first triathlon. I tried many nutrition and fitness apps, but they all felt the same:

too many features, accounts required, paywalls everywhere, and data collection I never really understood or asked for.

It made me realize something:

we live in a world that is over-featured, over-stimulated, and over-complicated. We keep adding more, instead of focusing on less.

So I built Protin.

Protin does one thing only:

it tracks your protein intake and tells you if you reached your goal.

That’s it.

No account.

No subscriptions.

No data collection.

And yes — it’s not free.

It’s a one-time payment.

Because nothing is truly free. If something is free, you usually pay with your data or attention. For me, a one-time payment is the minimum way to respect the work behind the app.

We spend $5 on a coffee or $30 on food delivery without thinking twice — this felt fair.

Is this a niche app? Absolutely.

Will everyone love it? Probably not.

But in a world of 8 billion people, I believe there are at least a few others who value simplicity over everything.

If that sounds like you, give Protin a try.

And if you download it and pay for it — thank you. Truly.

Please reach out with feedback. Any feature request that stays within the spirit of simplicity is welcome.

On a mission to simplify things.

1qqg8lu,https://i.redd.it/5aawy11bxbgg1.png,Raft Survival: Ocean’s Deadly Game,"Chapter 1 Raft Survival: Global Edition

The sky above Gwen Swann was a clean, endless blue. No clouds. No contrails. Under her, the ocean went on forever, a dark mouth that did not blink.



She sat on a raft barely 43 square feet in area. No land. No boats. No gulls. Just water and the slap of waves. The spray soaked her jeans and the fabric stuck cold to her legs, like the sea was claiming her piece by piece.



Gwen stared ahead, her mind completely blank. She was pretty sure that five minutes ago, she'd been at the office, half-dead from overtime, staring at a spreadsheet and wondering if coffee counted as dinner.



Gwen thought, 'Kidnapped? By who, exactly.



'I am a soft target with nothing to my name. What, someone hauled me out here to inherit my student loans and maxed-out Visa?'



A translucent screen flickered into view at the corner of her vision, like a heads-up display from a game. Lines of text scrolled by.



\[Global Chat\]:



\[Okay, no joke, where the hell are we?\]



\[I was literally about to clutch a pentakill and now I'm in the ocean. This has to be a prank.\]



\[Someone tell me I'm dreaming. Or knock me out. Either works.\]



\[Is anyone else here actually real? I don't see a single person.\]



\[I'm gonna throw up. I get seasick on this boat. This is not funny.\]



\[Bro, calling this thing a boat is generous. My dog's crate is bigger.\]



\[Seasick? Try having deep-sea phobia. I swear something huge just swam under my raft.\]



\[Nana, if you're watching from heaven, please don't let me die like this!\]



Gwen exhaled quietly. 'Good. I am not alone. At least this nightmare has company.'



The chat continued to dissolve into chaos, but before she could read more, another voice cut through everything. Cold. Flat. Inhuman. It didn't come from the screen. It came from inside her head.



\[Congratulations. You have entered the Ocean Survival Game. Player ID: 29,786,510.



\[All five billion players have successfully entered the game. The Grand Sea Route is now officially open. Please remember the following navigation rules.



\[From this point forward, your life will take place at sea. You may collect resources by salvaging floating debris, fishing, and exploring islands in order to upgrade your vessel and survive.



\[During the New Player Protection Period, players are prohibited from attacking one another. Violations will result in system penalties.



\[The New Player Protection Period lasts three days. During this time, overall difficulty is significantly reduced. Use this window wisely and gather supplies as quickly as possible.



\[You have one life. Please do not waste it.



\[After the protection period ends, the global event ""Ocean Storm"" will begin.



\[Warning: the storm will destroy all vessels with a Sturdiness Value below five. Upgrade your ship to ensure survival.



\[A Beginner Blind Box has been delivered to your vessel. Happy sailing.\]



Right on cue, something dropped from above. A small wooden box hit the raft with a dull thump and slid to a stop near Gwen's feet.



A large question mark was painted on the lid. So this was the so-called Beginner Blind Box.



Only then did she notice the rest of her starting equipment. A fishing rod lay near the edge of the raft, old enough to look like it had lived several past lives.



Next to it sat an iron grappling hook, spotted with rust and tied to a fraying rope.



The moment she focused on them, translucent stat panels popped up in front of her eyes.



\[Worn Fishing Rod\]



\[Quality: Poor\]



\[Description: Standard beginner item. Everyone gets one. Can be used for fishing.\]



\[Worn Throwing Hook\]



\[Quality: Poor\]



\[Everyone gets one of these starter tools. Use it to snag whatever junk's floating by on the waves.\]



\[Dilapidated Wooden Raft\]



\[Sturdiness: 1 (May fall apart at any time.)\]



\[Speed: 0 (It's a busted raft. Manage your expectations.)\]



\[Storage Capacity: 0/10 slots\]



\[Durability: 100/100\]



\[Upgrade requirements: 20 Wood, 10 Cloth, 10 Seaweeds, 1 Iron Ore, 1 Dull Pearl.\]



\[(Upgrade unavailable. Insufficient materials.)\]



After reading through the raft's stats, Gwen finally understood just how bad things were.



Five billion people around the world had been dumped into this so-called survival game. Everyone started the same way. One useless raft. No food. No fresh water. And a three-day countdown.



Technically, a person could survive about a week without food if they were careful. But the ocean storm coming in three days would wipe out this raft without even trying. A structural rating of one might as well be a death sentence.



If she wanted to live, upgrading this floating pile of wood wasn't optional. It was everything.



Gwen had never been the kind of person who wasted energy complaining about fate. When she realized something couldn't be changed, she made the only sensible choice. She adapted, and she did it fast.



That was how the world worked. Survival of the fittest. The strong stayed standing, and everyone else got swept aside.



She understood that rule instinctively. So while the global chat was still packed with people shouting, whining, and melting down in real time, Gwen was already moving, quietly collecting whatever she could get her hands on.



She wrapped the rope of the throwing hook securely around her wrist and locked onto a wooden plank drifting about fifteen feet straight ahead.



The metal hook sliced through the air with a sharp whistle. It grazed the edge of the plank and missed.



The hook splashed into the water and vanished beneath the surface, swallowed whole by the sea.



Gwen pulled the rope, reeling the hook back in.



She had underestimated how fast the hook traveled, and she hadn't accounted for the way the current nudged floating debris forward. Lesson learned. On the second throw, she adjusted her timing and released.



The hook landed squarely in the middle of the plank.



Nailed it.



She hauled it in and noticed a strip of bright green seaweed tangled around the bottom.



\[Item acquired: 1 Wood, 1 Seaweed\]



A buy-one-get-one deal. She wasn't complaining.



Everything she collected was automatically transferred into the raft's storage. A notification popped up as the capacity updated to 2 out of 500.



No breaks. Gwen's eyes were already on the next piece of debris.



\[Wood+1\]



\[Cloth +1\]



\[Seaweed +1\]



\*\*\*\*\*



Three hours later, Gwen barely had to think about it anymore. Her wrist felt sore, sure, but her accuracy was ridiculous. Anything she aimed at might as well have been glued to the hook. Misses were rare.



She checked her inventory. Twenty three pieces of wood. Eleven cloth. Ten seaweed.



That was enough to upgrade the raft. What she still needed was iron ore and that dull-looking pearl. And she had no clue where either of those came from.



Out of curiosity, she glanced back at the global chat. The conversation had moved on. Everyone was now arguing about the newbie loot boxes.



\[Are you kidding me? Five pieces of wood. That's it?\]



\[I got two bottles of water. Best day of my life. I was about to pass out.\]



\[Five wood gang here.\]



\[Same. Five wood.\]



\[Same here.\]



\[So the devs really went full gacha scam on us, huh?\]



\[This is supposed to be a starter reward, not a slap in the face.\]



\[Cry more. Check out what I pulled.\]



One message stood out immediately. Someone had posted a full item card.



\[Shark Tooth Dagger\]



\[Quality: Common\]



\[A dagger made from shark teeth. Sharp enough. Deals double damage to sharks.\]



'Wait, weapons are in the loot boxes too?' Gwen thought, surprised.



Gwen scrolled. Weapon pulls were rare. Most people got basic materials. Some luckier players scored food, fresh water, binoculars, or flint.



One insanely lucky player claimed they had pulled one hundred dull pearls.



Gwen's eyes narrowed. The raft upgrade required one pearl. She still had no idea how to get one, and it was obvious these were way more valuable than wood or cloth.



The pearl guy wasted no time. \[Selling extra pearls. One pearl for 200 wood, cloth, or seaweed.\]



\[Two hundred wood for one pearl? Just mug us next time.\]



\[I fished up a giant oyster with the starter rod. Cracked it open, pearl inside. If you want pearls, go fishing.\]



\[Fishing my ass. I've been sitting here for an hour and nothing's biting.\]



\[Same. Didn't catch a thing and almost fell in.\]



\[Basic fishing tip. You need bait. I tore off a piece of bread from a loot box, tied it to the hook, instant fish.\]



\[So what you're saying is I need food to get food?\]



\[No bait means no fish. No fish means no food. This game is evil.\]



\[Selling one piece of wheat bread, 150 grams, for 200 wood. First come, first served.\]



\[Dude, that's even worse than the pearl guy.\]



\[I would rather starve than trade my pride for bread.\]



\[Trading newbie blind box for five pieces of wheat bread.\]



\[People are selling blind boxes already?\]



\[My luck sucks anyway. Five wood isn't doing me any favors.\]



Everyone was brand new, all stuck with the same problems. No food. No water. The moment someone had extras, prices went through the roof.



Gwen felt the faint tug of hunger in her stomach after hours of work, but it was manageable. She wasn't desperate yet. Trading valuable resources for food now would just mean grinding for someone else's benefit.



She picked up the blind box resting on the raft. Trading it for bread was probably the smart move. Still, Gwen hesitated. Compared to five pieces of wood, taking a shot at luck didn't seem like the worst idea in the world.



Chapter 2 The Legendary Rod

Gwen worked a thumb under the seal and muttered a quick prayer to the loot gods. 'Not lumber. Please not lumber. If it isn't a weapon, let it be food.'



The box popped, and a long, slender rod shimmered into her hand.



\[Lucky Octo Fishing Rod\]



\[Quality: Legendary\]



\[Comes with a jelly octopus lure that gives off a strange scent and has ridiculous suction. Guarantees a bite with every cast and greatly increases your odds of pulling rare fish and rare items.



\[Fair warning: certain uncanny creatures are also drawn to it. Use with care.



\[Anglers never get skunked!\]



Gwen's eyes lit up. 'Talk about perfect timing. With a rod that comes with its own bait, I don't have to worry about finding any myself.'



And it was legendary. Back home she had dabbled in those cheesy pay to win MMOs where numbers fly off mobs like confetti. Legendary sounded a whole lot sweeter than the common dagger people were flexing in global chat.



Shame it was a fishing rod. She would have killed for something she could swing.



Still, no sense getting greedy. Compared to the poor souls who drew five planks, this was an S tier start.



She gave the rod a closer look. The build was miles ahead of the starter stick, with fancy scrollwork carved into the grip. A clear little octopus hung at the end of the line, glossy and wobbly like a gummy candy.



She tapped it with a fingertip. The tiny octopus twitched, then latched on with all eight arms. Okay, that suction was no joke. She couldn't peel it off.



Gwen muttered, ""Easy there, buddy. Let go.""



She rapped it gently on the head with her other hand. The octopus seemed to realize it had the wrong target and unhooked itself, almost apologetic.



Gwen faced the open water, set her stance, and sent the line out in a clean, pretty arc.



Legendary or not, she fully expected a bite.



That warning about uncanny creatures in the description went straight into the mental trash.



'When your stomach is filing complaints, you do not worry about sea spooks. If it is edible, it is eligible,' Gwen scoffed to herself.



Two minutes had not even passed when the float snapped under and vanished.



Her wrist dipped. The rod bowed into a tidy arc under the pull.



Fish on.



The fight was nothing. She hauled up in one smooth motion and slapped a small, silver bright fish onto the raft. Its tail drummed the boards like a snare.



\[You obtained: Jack Mackerel x1\]



\[Auto dismantle? (System processing reduces yield.) \]



She hit Yes. No tools, no way to deal with guts, and she was not about to chew the thing whole like a seal.



\[You obtained: Jack Mackerel Fillet x3\]



She weighed the slices in her palm. The fish had to be about a pound, and after the system took its cut, more than a third had evaporated. Highway robbery.



Gwen clicked her tongue. Yeah, no. She decided once she had decent tools, she would clean her catch herself. No more letting the system skim her dinner.



Her stomach chimed in again. She raised a piece of raw fillet and took a bite. The texture was soft and tender, almost creamy, with a faint sweetness that lingered after she swallowed.



'Fresh caught hits different,' Gwen thought, savoring the flavor.



She polished off the fillets in a few quick bites. Maybe half full. The fish had been way too small.



She wrapped her fingers tighter around the rod and cast again. 'With a rod that literally never come up empty, food is the least of my worries, right?'



Not long after, the bobber dipped. Another bite.



She reeled it in with barely any effort.



The sun was sinking fast, the light thinning into dusk. Whatever was on the hook gleamed against the darkening water, and for a split second she thought she had struck it rich. Then she leaned closer. A starfish.



\[Glowing Starfish\]



\[Inedible. Emits light at night. Can be used as an adorable bedside lamp.\]



Gwen stared at it, the corners of her mouth twitching. 'Awesome,' she thought. 'Real cute. Totally useless.'



It didn't struggle or try to crawl away, so she dumped it off to the side of the raft.



After that, things went completely sideways. She caught two more horse mackerel and one sea bream. Everything else was glowing starfish. Blue ones. Green ones. Pink ones.



They stacked up until half the raft was covered, like they had organized a group outing and decided her hook was the place to be. Gwen squinted at the pile and sighed. 'Did I drop anchor in a starfish daycare or what?'



The night sky was pitch black, no moon, no stars. The heap of glowing starfish became the only light around, colors weaving together and shifting constantly. Blue, green, pink, purple, all bleeding into each other.



Her face, her hands, even the wooden planks under her boots were washed in that unreal glow. The light spilled out onto the surrounding sea, making it look like the raft was drifting through a magical field of stars.



There was no sail, but the raft kept moving with the current. Maybe she really had drifted straight into their territory. That would explain a lot.



She rubbed her sore wrist just as a familiar system chime sounded.



\[Heads up, players: It is now 11:00 p.m. Between 11:00 p.m. and 5:00 a.m., the chance of catching eerie creatures and special items is doubled. We recommend getting proper rest. Staying up late is bad for your health.\]



Three fish. All small. That was the entire haul. Not great.



She needed enough to eat tomorrow, and she had hoped to trade extra fish for fresh water with other players. The system's cheerful warning made her uneasy.



Gwen exhaled slowly. 'One last cast,' she told herself. 'If it's another glow stick with legs, I'm done for the night.'



She cast again. A few minutes passed, then her rod dipped hard. This time the weight nearly yanked it from her hands.



Now that was more like it. Sixty pounds at least. Probably more. She braced her feet and started reeling, a grin breaking through. Finally. Anything but another starfish.



Gwen had always been strong. As a kid she dominated both sprints and distance runs. In college she could hoist a full water jug with one hand, no problem. When she rolled up her sleeves, muscle lines stood out clear as day.



She gave the line a sharp tug and frowned. Whatever she had hooked was not fighting back. No thrashing. No pull. Just dead weight.



""Don't tell me I snagged a rock,' she thought. 'Maybe coral.'



She reeled it in steadily and dragged it up alongside the raft. Then she grabbed it with both hands and hauled it aboard.



It turned out to be a wine barrel, easily half as tall as she was.



Gwen didn't open it right away. She leaned in and knocked on the lid, listening. Nothing moved. Satisfied, she slid a wooden plank into the seam and pried.



The lid popped loose, and a wave of stale, rotten air rushed out.



Gwen pinched her nose and leaned over to look inside. Curled within the barrel was a complete human skeleton.



The skull wore a wide-brimmed pirate tricorn, complete with an eyepatch. The left hand still clutched a rusted revolver. On the right hand, something caught the light, flashing brightly on a finger bone. It was a ring.



Chapter 3 The Legacy Of A Special Profession

Out on the open ocean in the middle of the night, the moon threw a cold wash of light into the barrel and turned those bones paper white.



The empty sockets stared at Gwen. Creepy, sure, if one scared easy.



Gwen didn't. She lifted an eyebrow, more bored than bothered.



'Please,' she thought, 'it's a skeleton. Back when it was breathing, it couldn't have gone one round with me. Now that it's dead, I'm not losing a wink of sleep.'



She reached in and fished out the soaked pirate hat.



\[Captain Malcolm's Pirate Hat\]



\[Quality: uncommon (Damaged, repairable)\]



\[A swaggering captain's hat that radiates command presence. While worn, crewwide morale +1 when you issue orders.\]



Not bad. Better tier than that shark-tooth dagger folks had been flexing in global chat. She checked the pistol, then the ring.



\[Rusted Revolver\]



\[Quality: Uncommon (Damaged, repairable)\]



\[Just your average revolver, but after soaking in seawater for years, the barrel's rusted and the aim's not what it used to be.\]



The revolver was the same tier as the hat, both out of commission until she fixed them. Her eyes slid to the ring, and that was it. Hooked.



\[Ring of the Undead\]



\[Quality: Legendary\]



\[Wearing this triggers the Ghost Pirate class inheritance. Cannot be removed.\]



\[Curse: Upon death you will become a skeleton; your soul will not find rest.\]



\[Includes 1,000-slot storage.\]



(Item rarity, low to high: Poor - Common - Uncommon - Rare - Epic- Unique - Legendary)



Gwen held her breath, grinning despite herself. Another Legendary.



She had no clue what a Ghost Pirate did, but Legendary meant heavy hitters. Plus a thousand storage slots. Her raft had, what, ten?



The curse? Please. In a survival game this rough, most players were lucky to make it a few days.



To her, worrying about the afterlife felt like putting a roof on a house one hadn't framed yet.



She slid the ring on without hesitation.



\[You have obtained a special class: Ghost Pirate.\]



\[You have acquired the class skills Spectral Footwork and Bone Reanimation.\]



\[Spectral Footwork: Your movement becomes spectral; no one can pin you down. Blink to any point within 33 feet. Costs 10 magic points. Cooldown: 30 minutes.\]



\[Bone Reanimation: Stir bones back to motion as your loyal minion. Costs 100 mana. (Requires bones to be at least 80% intact.)\]



\[Congratulations! You are the first player on the server to obtain a special class. Reward: System Blind Box x1. It will be airdropped to your raft shortly.\]



A wooden crate stamped with question marks thumped onto the raft out of thin air.



Gwen barely looked at it. She was too busy savoring the jackpot.



Spectral Footwork was the perfect panic button, pure blink-and-you-missed-it. Bone Reanimation sounded downright busted in the best way.",1,1769710318.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1qqg75z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1qqg75z/how_to_become_a_romantic_man_that_women_actually/,How to Become a ROMANTIC Man That Women Actually Want: The Psychology Behind Real Romance,"Let me guess. You've probably tried the whole ""surprise flowers"" thing once or twice, maybe sent a sweet text here and there, but deep down you feel like you're just... winging it? Like there's this whole romantic language you never quite learned, and now you're watching other guys effortlessly sweep women off their feet while you're stuck googling ""romantic gestures"" at 2am.

Here's what nobody tells you: Romance isn't about grand gestures or copying some movie scene. It's a skill you can actually learn. I've spent months digging into relationship psychology, reading everything from attachment theory research to interviews with therapists, and yeah, talking to a lot of women about what actually makes them feel seen and desired. Turns out, most guys are getting this wrong in the exact same ways.

The real kicker? Society never taught us this shit. We got action movies and sports, but no one sat us down and explained how emotional attunement works or why thoughtfulness hits different than expensive gifts. But here's the good news: once you understand the mechanics behind what makes someone feel romanced, it becomes way easier.

 1. Stop Performing Romance, Start Paying Attention

Most guys think romance is about doing big things. Nope. Romance is about noticing small things. Women feel most romanced when they realize you've been paying attention to details they didn't even know they shared.

She mentioned she loves rainy mornings three months ago? Text her a cozy playlist when it rains. She gets stressed on Tuesdays because of work meetings? Leave her favorite snack somewhere she'll find it Tuesday morning.

This is backed by research in relationship psychology. Dr. John Gottman's work shows that successful relationships are built on ""bids for connection,"" those tiny moments where someone shares something and you actually respond. Romance isn't the gesture itself, it's proving ""I see you, I remember you, you matter to me.""

Start keeping mental notes. Not in a creepy spreadsheet way, but genuinely listen when she talks. Women notice when you remember.

 2. Master the Art of Anticipation

Real romance creates anticipation. Not mystery or playing games, but building genuine excitement through thoughtfulness.

Here's how: Don't just plan a date. Tease it. ""I found this place I think you're going to lose your mind over. Friday at 7?"" Now she's curious all week. The anticipation becomes part of the experience.

Or try this: Send her something that arrives before you do. Not flowers (although flowers are fine), but something that shows you know her taste. A book by that author she casually mentioned. That specific tea she orders. The anticipation of ""he's thinking about me even when we're apart"" hits different.

The app Ash is actually pretty solid for this. It's like having a relationship coach in your pocket that helps you understand communication patterns and timing. Way better than just shooting random romantic texts into the void.

 3. Get Physical (But Not How You Think)

Non-sexual physical affection is insanely underrated. Research from the Touch Research Institute shows that physical touch releases oxytocin, the bonding hormone. But most guys only get physical when they want sex, and women can smell that agenda from a mile away.

Random acts of physical affection:
* Grab her hand when you're walking, not because you have to, but because you want to.
* Play with her hair while you're watching TV.
* Kiss her forehead randomly.
* Pull her in for a hug from behind while she's cooking.
* Rest your hand on her lower back when you're in public.

These micro-touches throughout the day create way more romantic tension than one big gesture. It's the difference between ""he wants something from me"" and ""he can't help but touch me because he's drawn to me.""

 4. Create Rituals That Are Just Yours

Shared rituals build intimacy like nothing else. Esther Perel talks about this in her relationship work. These don't have to be elaborate. Could be:

* Sunday morning coffee in bed together (no phones).
* A specific song that's ""your song"" that you play randomly.
* A weekly walk where you both share one thing that happened that week.
* Cooking a specific meal together every month.

The key is consistency. Romance isn't just spontaneity. It's also showing up reliably in small ways that say ""this matters to me.""

 5. Write It Down (Yes, Really)

Texting is easy. Handwritten notes hit different. There's actual psychology behind this, the physical act of writing something by hand creates more emotional weight for both writer and receiver.

You don't need to be Shakespeare. Just genuine:
* ""Thought about you when I saw this today"" with a photo of something she'd appreciate.
* A sticky note on the bathroom mirror before she wakes up.
* A short letter explaining specifically what you love about her (not generic stuff, specific observations).

The book ""The 5 Love Languages"" by Gary Chapman is clutch here. This thing has sold over 20 million copies and won multiple awards because it breaks down exactly how different people receive love. Some people need words, others need actions, some need touch. Figure out her language and speak it. Insanely good read that'll make you question everything you thought you knew about showing affection. Chapman is a relationship counselor with decades of research, and this book basically gives you the cheat codes.

 6. Plan Experiences, Not Just Dates

Dinner is fine. Dinner is safe. But romance lives in experiences that create stories.

Psychologist Dr. Leaf Van Boven's research shows that experiential purchases create more lasting happiness than material ones. Translation: memories beat things every time.

Ideas:
* Surprise picnic at sunset (basic but effective if you put thought into her favorite foods).
* Take a random day trip somewhere neither of you have been.
* Book a couple's cooking class or pottery class (yeah, like Ghost, whatever, it works).
* Create a scavenger hunt that ends somewhere meaningful to your relationship.

The trick is specificity to her interests. Don't take her rock climbing if she hates heights just because you think it's romantic. Romance is about her, not your Pinterest board idea of romance.

 7. Become a Student of Her Inner World

This is the big one. The difference between guys women find romantic and guys they don't? Romantic guys are deeply curious about their partner's inner world.

Ask deeper questions:
* ""What made you feel most alive this week?""
* ""If you could change one thing about your day, what would it be?""
* ""What's something you've been thinking about lately?""

Then actually listen. Don't fix, don't offer solutions, just hold space. The podcast The Art of Charm has incredible episodes about active listening and emotional intelligence. These skills make you not just romantic, but magnetic.

There's also an AI learning platform called BeFreed that pulls from relationship psychology research, therapy insights, and expert interviews to create personalized audio content. 

If you're trying to level up your romantic skills specifically, you can ask it to build a learning plan around ""becoming more romantically intelligent as an introvert"" or ""understanding female psychology in dating,"" and it creates structured episodes from books like Mating in Captivity, research on attachment theory, and real relationship expert talks. You control the depth, from quick 15-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. 

The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's this smooth, conversational style that makes absorbing relationship psychology way less dry than reading academic papers. Worth checking out if you're serious about understanding the mechanics behind what actually makes women feel romanced.

""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel will blow your mind. She's one of the world's leading relationship therapists, and this bestseller explores how to keep desire alive in long-term relationships. It's sexy, it's smart, and it completely reframes how you think about romance and attraction. Best relationship book I've ever read, hands down.

 8. Be Spontaneous with Intention

Sounds contradictory, right? But hear me out. True spontaneity within a relationship means breaking patterns in thoughtful ways.

* She expects you home at 6? Show up at 4 with her favorite takeout and a ""let's go somewhere"" attitude.
* Book a hotel room in your own city for one night just to change the scenery.
* Randomly declare a ""no plans"" day where you both just exist together without agendas.

The app Finch is actually helpful here for building better habits around thoughtfulness. It's a self-care app that helps you track patterns and set reminders to do the small things that matter. Sounds corny, but consistency is what separates romantic guys from guys who have one good idea every six months.

 9. Make Her Laugh (Then Make Her Feel Safe)

Humor and security are the ultimate romantic combo. Women are drawn to guys who can make them laugh, but romance happens when they feel safe enough to be vulnerable.

This means:
* Don't use humor to deflect serious conversations.
* Be playful, but know when to shift to genuine.
* Never make her the butt of the joke in ways that make her insecure.
* Show up when shit gets real. Romance isn't just the fun times.

Dr. Sue Johnson's work on Emotionally Focused Therapy shows that the deepest romantic bonds come from being a ""secure base"" for your partner. You can be fun and light, but also solid and dependable.

 10. Understand That Romance is a Practice, Not a Personality

Here's the truth bomb: You're not ""just not a romantic guy."" That's a cop-out. Romance is a skill set, and like any skill, you get better with practice.

Start small. Pick three things from this list and do them this week. Notice what lands. Pay attention to her reactions. Adjust. Romance isn't one-size-fits-all. What makes one woman swoon might make another cringe. Your job is to learn her specific language.

Check out the YouTube channel Charisma on Command. They break down social dynamics and relationship behavior in ways that make you better at reading people and situations. Their videos on romantic communication are goldmines.

Bottom line? Romance isn't about being someone you're not. It's about being more intentional with who you already are. It's showing up consistently, paying attention relentlessly, and giving a damn about the small details that make her feel seen.

Stop overthinking the big gestures. Master the small moments. That's where real romance lives.",1,1769710235.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

I've been working on a music discovery app for the last 3 weeks after speaking with my friend who's been DJing for a few years now and has definitely influenced some of my music taste. Happy to share my progress and ask for feedback on my first mobile app: Sona.

Sona is a music discovery app powered by people and places, not algorithms.  
Website: [https://sonafm.com](https://sonafma.com/)

We were talking about how discovering music feels so algorithmic lately. Our feeds are always trying to push us specific sounds and content that may not be what we want to see or hear. Or even worse, I thought about where I've found ""newer"" music and the answer was pretty simple: through people and places. I love discovering new music out in the real world, whether that's at a local cafe in the city or while I'm out at a DJ set. Yes, Shazam is a thing and a cool tool but I feel like discovering new music is a lot more than just ""audio detection."" Sometimes I want to remember where I heard it or with who.

With the right usage, I thought it would be pretty cool to have this global guide where you can see what's being played where and by who or keep up with people whose taste you trust. Or even see what specific bars and cafes are playing. Music discovery through people, not algorithms. And if you don't want another ""social media"" app, then you can always opt-in to keep your profile and your discoveries private from viewing. What you'll have is still a pretty cool app (I think) for music logging and map of your own discoveries.

\- SwiftUI for the UI  
\- Supabase for the backend  
\- ShazamKit for audio recognition  
\- MapKit for venue detection

1qqg58p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qqg58p/the_psychology_of_keeping_flirt_alive/,The Psychology of Keeping FLIRT Alive: Science-Based Strategies That Actually Work in Long-Term Relationships,"Most couples hit that phase where flirting feels forced or just disappears entirely. You go from texting cute stuff during work to barely looking up from your phones at dinner. It's not that you love each other less, it's just that comfort can accidentally kill chemistry. I've spent months digging through relationship research, podcasts, and books to figure out why this happens and what actually works to fix it.

Turns out the problem isn't you or your partner. Our brains are literally wired to stop producing as many bonding chemicals after the honeymoon phase ends. Dopamine drops, oxytocin levels out, and suddenly you're roommates who occasionally have sex. Society doesn't help either because we're told that ""real love"" means being comfortable and stable, which somehow translates to boring. But here's the thing, you can have both stability and spark if you understand how to work with your biology instead of against it.

**The 20 second rule actually works.** Psychologist John Gottman found that couples who kiss for at least 20 seconds daily (not just a peck) maintain significantly higher relationship satisfaction. It sounds stupidly simple but it forces you to slow down and actually be present. Morning coffee? 20 second kiss. Before bed? Same thing. Your brain starts associating your partner with that dopamine hit again. Esther Perel talks about this in her podcast ""Where Should We Begin?"" and calls it ""erotic intelligence,"" basically the ability to keep desire alive through intentional acts.

**Treat your partner like someone you're still trying to impress.** This one hit hard when I read it in ""Mating in Captivity"" by Esther Perel (she's a couples therapist and her work is genuinely revolutionary). The book won awards and completely changed how I think about long term relationships. She argues that we need mystery and separateness to maintain attraction. When you know every single thing about someone's day, there's no curiosity left. So stop reporting every mundane detail. Keep some experiences just for yourself. Surprise them with random compliments that aren't just ""you look nice."" Be specific and a bit cheeky. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what makes relationships work. Insanely good read.

**Touch without expectation.** One study from the Kinsey Institute showed that non sexual physical affection (hand holding, back rubs, playful touching) was more strongly correlated with relationship happiness than sexual frequency. Flirting dies when every touch becomes transactional or leads to the same outcome. Grab their butt while they're doing dishes just because. Run your hand through their hair during a movie. Make out on the couch with zero intention of it going further. It recreates that teenage energy where touch was exciting on its own.

**Use the Paired app for structured playfulness.** I know app recommendations feel weird but this one's actually designed by relationship therapists. It gives you daily questions and challenges that force vulnerable conversations and playful interactions you'd never think to do otherwise. Questions like ""what's something I do that turns you on that I probably don't realize"" or challenges to send a flirty text at a random time. It removes the awkwardness of trying to be spontaneously flirty when you've been together forever because the app gives you permission to be weird about it.

There's also BeFreed, an AI learning app that pulls from relationship psychology research, expert interviews, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content. You can set a goal like ""keeping attraction alive in a long-term relationship"" and it'll generate a learning plan tailored to your specific situation, whether you're an introvert struggling with verbal flirting or someone who needs help maintaining mystery. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with actual examples and frameworks you can apply. Built by Columbia grads and former Google AI experts, it's particularly useful for synthesizing insights from sources like Perel's work, Gottman's research, and attachment theory into something you can actually use while commuting or doing chores.

**Schedule novelty, not just date nights.** Dr. Arthur Aron's research on relationship maintenance found that couples who regularly engage in novel and arousing activities together (not sexually arousing, just exciting) report significantly higher relationship quality. Standard dinner and movie dates don't cut it because they're too predictable. Try something neither of you have done before. Rock climbing, a cocktail making class, exploring a neighborhood you've never been to. Adrenaline and dopamine get associated with each other and suddenly you're looking at your partner like they're interesting again.

**Flirt in your own language, not Instagram's version.** Social media makes it seem like flirting has to be these grand romantic gestures or perfectly crafted sexy texts. That's exhausting and fake. Real flirting in long term relationships looks like inside jokes, playful teasing, ridiculous pet names you'd be embarrassed to say in public. Figure out what makes your partner specifically feel desired and do more of that. For some people it's compliments, for others it's acts of service done with a wink. The YouTube channel ""The School of Life"" has a video called ""Why We Go Cold On Our Partners"" that breaks this down brilliantly. They talk about how flirting is really just communicating ""I still choose you"" in creative ways.

**Maintain separate identities.** This circles back to Perel's work but it's crucial. The couples who stay flirty are the ones who haven't completely merged into one blob. You need your own hobbies, friends, and experiences. When you come back together after pursuing your individual interests, you're bringing new energy and stories. There's something to be curious about again. Codependency murders flirtation because there's no space left for desire to exist.

The brutal truth is that long term flirting takes conscious effort. It won't happen automatically like it did when you first met. But that doesn't mean it's inauthentic or forced, it just means you're choosing to prioritize playfulness and attraction alongside all the other relationship maintenance you're already doing. Your relationship can be both your safest space and your most exciting one, but only if you actively create that balance.",1,1769710125.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

At first she was distant and didn’t seem to be interested, but then she opened up and just spilled everything about herself on the table. First she started with some traumas… should have noticed sooner that this is not normal.

But when she talked it out she invited me for a coffee and talked more. I only spoke about myself for maybe 20min during our 5 hour long meet-up…

I expected her to listen to me more as she promised - she was interested in me and wanted to go through my struggles as well “together” yet to always promise me and never do that in her actions.

I bought her gifts and took care of her as much as I could as when I fall in love - I love deeply.

But she wanted more and more.

People around her were telling me that she is a good person, but she barely moved a finger for me.

Maybe sometimes gave me support.

One day I had a hard time and went cold and didnt speak to her much. She took it personally and thought I was stonewalling her but I explained why I was this way. She didnt listen - even after things I did for her she decided that I am not “the one” and made me pack my bags instantly. On my way she texted me “you used me”…

Scandals, tweets, resignations, accusations, nonstop drama. Meanwhile, reports about climate impacts, healthcare struggles, or education crises scroll by in tiny fonts like they’re not even supposed to compete for attention. I felt equal parts overwhelmed and amused, like I accidentally signed up for a global soap opera.

It made me realize this isn’t just about my morning routine. Globally, media systems prioritize spectacle over substance. People everywhere end up reacting to personalities instead of policies, outrage instead of understanding. The news becomes a circus that trains us to care more about the flashy than the fundamental, shaping perception in a way that benefits the already powerful.

Maybe a better approach is simple but radical: read beyond the headlines, follow sources that track systemic issues, and question why some stories are amplified while others vanish. Or maybe I’m just overthinking while sipping coffee and scrolling. How do you make sense of the flood of political noise without losing your mind?",1,1769709885.0,I_DONT_LIKE,1,0.67,False
1qqg0s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qqg0s5/aitah_for_telling_my_roommate_i_wont_adjust_my/,AITAH for telling my roommate I won’t adjust my schedule around her sleep?,"I live with a roommate who has a completely different schedule than I do. She stays up late and usually sleeps in. I wake up early for classes and the gym, and it’s a routine that keeps me sane during the semester.

In the mornings, I genuinely try to be quiet. I don’t blast music, I keep the lights low, and I’m in and out of the kitchen pretty fast. I make coffee, pack my bag, and leave around 7am.

Lately, she’s been getting more annoyed about it. She told me the sound of the coffee maker and me moving around “ruins her sleep” and asked if I could go to the gym later or prep everything the night before so I wouldn’t be up so early.

I told her I didn’t want to do that. I already feel like I’m being careful, and changing my entire morning routine would affect my classes, workouts, and honestly my energy for the whole day. I said I didn’t think it was fair that my schedule had to revolve around hers.

She didn’t take that well. She said that living together means compromising and that I’m being difficult by refusing to adjust at all. Since then, she’s been noticeably colder in the apartment and makes comments about how she “can’t sleep anyway.”

Now I’m second guessing myself. I don’t want to be a bad roommate, but I also don’t think it’s reasonable for one person’s sleep schedule to dictate the other’s entire routine.

I did 4 years in uni and jumped straight in to a high pressure job and just need a break.

So until I find a new job I have decided to move back home to my mother’s house. There is my mum, my sister and my mums long term partner of 12 years.

Anyway he is a weirdo and territorial acting like I don’t belong in my own mums house. This was my mums house before he even knew her and he has no ownership.

Anyway, we have a coat rack so obviously I put my coat on it. Anyway he came upstairs threw my coat at me and said there is no room for me in this house. He said all my things need to go in my room because there’s no space for me. I told my mum and she told me to just ignore him and put my stuff wherever.

Anyway, I have been given a space in the fridge and I make homemade bread as it’s cheaper and I can make multiples with the ingredients since I’m not working I need to save money. The fat pig is eating all my bread!! I literally saw him make 6 sandwiches out of my loaf. 6!!! He then denied it and said he hasn’t taken my bread. He works full time and earns over 3k a month he can easily afford his own bread. My coffee is also going missing. He denies that but he went to work left his cup. Surprise Surprise had coffee in it. 

He also ‘accidentally’ put my yoghurt pots in my sister’s lunchbox as he didn’t know it was mine. The shelf literally has my name on it. 

He is also lying saying I’m leaving dirty dishes in the sink when they are his. I cook, eat, and I wash up straight after. Anyway, again he started complaining about something of mine that was left out. My pair of shoes and he kicked them across the hall and told me to move my shit as there isn’t room for me. So at this point I had to refresh his memory to 3 years ago when he got arrested and was literally banned from being anywhere near the house for 2 years. So I asked him how is it ‘his’ house when he legally wasn’t allowed in it for 2 years.

Well now I’ve apparently upset him and need to apologise. Erm ok well I’m upset the golumptious goat has eaten 3 loaves of my bread

Not to mention a few months ago my brother was in a similar position and had to move back and he did the same stuff with him. Leaving mess around and blaming him. He also told my brother to join the navy because if he died for our country at least his life would be worth soemthing.

I told my mum and she was like oh yes only joking. Erm ok 🤨🤨

Like seriously what is his problem?? He is 67 and I’m 25. I’m applying to jobs every day and I spent all my time doing surveys online jsut to earn money to buy the ingredients for my food. Sometimes I spent all day just to earn £5 so I can buy soemthing for myself only for him to take it. ",9,1769709851.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False
1qqfz8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qqfz8w/my_espresso_journey/,My espresso journey,"Story time! My wife and I were reflecting last night on the espresso we used to brew before upgrading our equipment and process – and it’s pretty baffling how far we’ve come. I thought the folks in this sub would enjoy (and cringe).

I had never brewed espresso when we first moved in together, so she showed me how to use her [Saeco Via Venezia](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/RI9367_47/via-venezia-manual-espresso-machine?srsltid=AfmBOoq0xGwuAegJh0tlKFjVuTTE62ge5IKPiwHf18JjrqRy-2mmAzso)[,](https://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/RI9367_47/via-venezia-manual-espresso-machine?srsltid=AfmBOoq0xGwuAegJh0tlKFjVuTTE62ge5IKPiwHf18JjrqRy-2mmAzso) [Krups grinder,](https://www.krupsusa.com/BREAKFAST-APPLIANCES/COFFEE-GRINDERS/Fast-Touch-Electric-Coffee-and-Spice-Grinder-F2034251/p/1500813248) and [Keurig milk frother](https://www.keurig.com/Spare-Parts/K-Cafe-Essentials-Frother/p/Replacement-Frother-K-Cafe-Essentials#). It involved putting an indiscriminate amount of espresso beans in the single blade grinder, grinding them into a gravely texture, spooning the grounds into the portafilter, lightly distributing the grounds around with the spoon, slapping it into the machine and pulling a shot. We’d intentionally not tamp the grounds down much, because it was easier to scoop out the muddy soup left behind after brewing. We would brew the espresso into small metal pitchers that and fill them to the brim. I just weighed it to check – 110 g output. BTW we did this for years. Years!!

After upgrading (to a Lelit MaraX V2 + DF64) and spending some time learning more about how to properly brew espresso (shout out u/piccio19), it’s wild to think about how we managed to fail at every step of the process. We didn’t weigh the input, didn’t grind even remotely fine enough, no DWT, no distributor, no tamping, no timing of the shot or weighing the output, no heating the portafilter or cups ahead of time, etc. We didn’t use a steam wand. Not to mention the machine was descaled maybe once in the course of 10 years. For a minute we had a problem where nothing was coming through the basket so I took a sewing needle to each of the little holes to remove the gunk.

We knew we were overdue for a new machine, but had no idea how far off our end to end workflow was. I’d seen the POV videos of people going through their 80 step process with spritzing the beans and flipping the portafilter and just thought that was overkill. Pure faff. But the main thing I learned after getting a new machine is if you actually care want to make some decent espresso then you can’t really half ass it - especially if you’re going to spend the money on a nice machine. Why bother if you’re not willing to put in the effort?

And of course now I don’t think of it as an effort but a relaxing and rewarding routine. Now our espresso is rich and syrupy and strong – not the watery, under-extracted crap we used to pull. And to think whenever we had guests stay the night I was serving them these cappuccinos in the morning. Woof.

Still plenty to learn and room to grow, but had a good chuckle thinking back to how far we’ve come.",0,1769709771.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

I’ve realized that my social circle has mostly been male, and I’m genuinely curious to broaden that — to have friendships that bring different perspectives, conversations, and ways of looking at life.

This is not a dating post and not a rushed thing. I’m open to building a comfortable, platonic friendship with someone in the 22–26 age range, where things grow naturally and at an easy pace.

I enjoy thoughtful conversations, light humour, and low-pressure meetups — coffee, walks, or just talking about everyday life, fitness, work, or random thoughts Bangalore traffic gives us.

I value emotional maturity, clear boundaries, and mutual respect. No expectations, no pressure — just openness and ease.

If this resonates, feel free to reach out 🌿

Edit: added TL;DR 

So I have been going through some stuff lately. Warning, long, long post. TL;DR at the bottom 

Part 1: the love of my life

I have been with my ex partner for about 7.5 years, since she was 16 and me 17. We were schoolmates and knew each other for 5 years before we hit it off already. I had exited my last relationship of a year and a half for about 8 months before that due to toxicity between us, stemming mostly from incompatibility and some deep seated trauma in both of us, and in that period I tried stuff and hit it up with some girls, but nothing serious. I decided I wanted to be with someone again, but this time I m someone who better fitted me, and in my searching she drew my interest, and I got to know her and she frankly amazed me. She was (and still is) such a great person, with interests and passion, and I felt something greater than just some interest. It felt like she was... Extra special, you know?

And so we hit it off. We were dance partners already, so the chemistry slowly grew on its own, and he finally hit it off on a school trip where we got together. And ever since, I had the best relationship I could dream of. It started as it normally would with getting to know each other really well, going on fun activities, spending time together, sexy times, the works. We grew on each other, and really, \*really\* loved each other. We met each other's families, vacations, trips together with our dancing and our music teams, shared hobbies and interests, gaming, and slowly getting so close to one another where she spent more time at my house rather than hers.

She was also there for me at my lowest times in my life. Though I visited a psychologist for some time and solved some issues, I would say that it was mostly thanks to her that I overcame some issues like fear of abandonment due to my parents breaking up in my early teens and them being toxic and creating a toxic family enviroment for me and my brother. I was welcomed into her family where I saw a way better working systems of support and love between the members there, and began to see an example of how things could be. It brought hope to my heart, man! And I started from relatively early on, about 3-4 years on, of how growing old with this woman would feel. I started making dreams with her. I know i know, we're too young for stuff like that, and I agree with you, but we both started thinking about how it would be to raise a home together, a family, with a dog and have little pitter patter of feet running around us. Slowly she spent 5+ days straight at my home, and due to certain circumstamces I happened to have the opportunity to keep the family home to myself since everyone else moved away. And so I did, and she instantly moved in with me, making this house into a couple's home. It was true love, and it was amazing. We cared for my elderly dog, and lately even got a new puppy

Of course things were not all good. Like relationships, we had our issues. We sometimes fought, we disagreed on stuff, and we definitely were a bit different as persons, but for me that was not a bad thing. She is a very carefree girl who, on the one hand helped me enjoy situations a bit more and taught me to take my overthinking mind off of stuff for a little while, but that also means that she was carefree in some situations that warranted some more attention and seriousness. And me on the other hand, I was always thinking ahead so as to always be on top of things which has helped in many, many scenarios in these last 10 years where I had to be mature as an adult even though I was just a teenager, but it also meant that I would tend to be more serious in situations that didn't need it, being a killjoy sometimes, and most importantly, trying to ""help her"" grow up in some stuff that needed her to be mature about them, as in government stuff, uni, degrees and everyday commonsense in some bad stuff she did absentmindedly (e.g. she once forgot the dog in the apartment building elevator for like an hour and we got yelled at by neighbors), which may have sometimes come off as pushy or overbearing. 

Add to that that I am overweight and due to clinical depression lost part of my libido for about 3+ years, and that she is a fairly sexual person with kinks that I couldn't get behind like BDSM and CNC, which I of course didn't judge, but simply couldn't offer her. I tried as much as I could to give her good passionate hugging (hey Rslash) but of course it wasn't good enough for her, and I do realize that and wish I could have been better. I have kinks of my own that she can't offer me as well but I probably don't need it as much as her. And also some loss of affection from me mostly as the relationship went on, not because I didn't love her but because I grew tired with life. I gave her lots of affection, but for example after covid I stopped going dancing with her and she felt hurt, because to her eyes I was her ""dance partner in life"". At the time I couldn't manage at all, I was all up in my head with some other stuff that was troubling me and a toxic home situation with my family that I was living with.

It's just that, little pieces of tiredness between us that slowly chipped away at the passion of the relationship and made us feel a bit stale and closed in. The love was extremely much there, we loved (and still do) each other up to our heads, but the relationship started to feel like it stagnated and like we were 40 years old. It felt like we were on the right moment for a bit of an older couple to actually plan for marriage or kids, but we both felt a bit too young for that. I wanted it with her, i \*dreamt\* it with her, just maybe not in this exact time. And for her it must have been even worse, because at least I had the opportunity to love deeply before, to experience a breakup, to mess around unseriously with girls, and also for my personal life to figure out through the years who I am and who I want to be, having also competed in music competitions, been in bands, traveled part of the world through my work as a musician and my passion, found a job in my field, and becoming a volunteer firefighter and becoming a part of a group of people like me who understand the way I feel. 

For her, she lived a normal life up until graduation, and then simply existed in the premises of her relationship with me and the stuff we did together. I always told her she should open more and make an effort to be active in her own interests and her social life, but she never quite managed to do that. I tried to help her by introducing her to my music groups and social groups, and indeed through that we went on trips and made many experiences, but she never realy blossomed beyond that. It was mostly things we did together, just like that dance team we were a part of at the start of our relationship. After I exited the team due to personal reasons, she did too, although she didn't need or want to. She could have continued on her passion of dancing on her own even if she preferred it with me, I believe. And she didn't have any real friends that she talked with or made plans with, only people from those groups who interacted mainly with me and her by extension 

Part 2: the bestfriend

Enter throughout all that a third player, my uni bestfriend of 6 years who I felt very close from the beginning. We were there for each other, and have helped each other a lot through many stuff, like helping each other cope through family problems, listening to each other when one needed an ear, going out and making experiences, money issues like lending money when one needed to, and helping each other advance our careers in our industry by mutual support. I helped him a step up, and he did the next. That kinda thing. One of his main quirks, to put it bluntly, was that he is pretty choosy in his choice of women to date. He had an active relationship life when he lived in his village, but after turning 18 and going to the big city to get in university (where we met) he only had in all the years i've known him less than 10 relationships, all of which ended before long and who he didn't reach any significant level of intimacy, either sexually or emotionally. It always seemed weird with me, but I let him be and just mocked him for always attracting virgin girls instead of experianced ones like he said he wanted (as any friend should).

Through the years he ended up becoming an integral part of my social life. We ended up hanging around a lot, even when we weren't together we often played online games. It was fun. Slowly my gf started joing us in all that, and the relationship between all evolved to a kind of triad that felt pretty secure and fun to be in. We went on vacation together, we celebrated birthdays, we did group projects, many long nights of gaming, going drifting (guy had a bmw), and generally many stuff together. He was fun to be around, and I could see that he felt really well as well being part of this, just like my girl.

Part 3: the fuckening

As I was saying, slowly through the years the relationship with my gf was a bit strained due to daily life getting to the both of us, but we persevered. Sexually speaking we were in a closed relationship but with freedom of talking around online or maybe getting into threesomes or group stuff etc, but only if the other agree as well. We had done some stuff, and in 2 occasions the bestfriend was part of a bit of play as well. The limits were though that they were to do nothing alone with each other, and they kept that limit for most of our time knowing each other.

The first incident happened about a year and a half ago, where I had just fiercely fought with my brother about us not being able to handle each other as roommates, about morals and other stuff, and we ended up ""breaking up"" our roommate relationship and him leaving for a new home. It was a hard time for reasons I won't specify but that went hand to hand with my older trauma and the aforementioned toxic family relations after my dad exited the family and left my mom with 2 kids alone. Not precisely an abusive situation, but surely very bad emotions at play. So at this period my bestfriend visited my house (where my gf had only recently moved in for good) for a fun evening of board games and some alcoholic beverage mixing for them (I don't really drink alcohol). I had to leave for a work incident for about 2 hours, but would be back to rejoin them pretty soon. After it was handled, I came back to see them both sitting on MY bed, looking extremely upset and guilty, where they told my that they messed up and went over the limit and she gave him a handjob while he was touching her. I got very mad, and left the house for some clean air. I was severely upset, but I tend to be non confrontational for some reason, and to always go above and beyond and understand the reasons behind it. I sat them down, we talked, asked them precisely  how they thought they messed up, and explained how it made me feel. They both apologized profusely, and accepted all I had to say about it. I set some pretty clear boundaries about the limits of our relationship, mostly that he doesn't get to do anything with her ever again and that they are to stay purely platonical friends. They accepted and we moved on. Things ran relatively smoothly after that. Me and my gf continued getting our house to feel like home, and the bestfriend did his stuff and we all hanged around sometimes. Easy stuff.

The start of the end:

About 4 months ago, me and my partner decided to get a puppy, since senior dog had started deteriorating and I hoped the pup would inherit some of his good traits (success!). Sadly the old pup had cancer, and his days were numbered. About a month after we found out, it progressed to a stage where I needed to make a very tough decision. I was a mess at that time. Absolute mess. I woke up every day the last 2 weeks of it trying to find even a glimpse of hope, of him getting a bit better, but seeing him get weaker by the day. I was feeling like I was run over by a train. I was about to lose my doggo best friend of 14 years. I was \*crushed\*. The day I put him down, my heart ripped in two, and I buried one of those parts with him. I was holding him while the vet did the injection, and felt his breathing stop. Ruined, i'm telling you. Of course by this point I was unable to provide psychologically for my relationship, and I was not in a point of handling executive decision making.

Exactly after the day my dog died, my gf started visiting my bestfriend's house, or constantly bringing him to our house. For the first time ever our work programs aligned and we had 2 consecutive days of the week off, and could spend them together. I was in no position to do that, having just lost my dog, but in that time my gf seemed... Weird. Done with stuff. Tired of trying to carry the burden of my feelings. I totally get it, sucks to have a partner with such drama in his life, but in most cases... That's life. She had the luck to live a more stress free childhood age so I can't blame her for feeling tired having carried my up to my dog's death, she needed rest. By this time she had found a bestfriend in my bestfriend. They went shopping, car rides, coffee, mini dates, frankly. I wasn't blind, it stank to me. I told my gf that I wasn't very good about what I was seeing. She swore she just finally found a friend, someone who understands her in some parts that she has never felt understood. But I told her I still don't like it, and that in any case i'm her boyfriend and really need her to be here and want her company. She relented somewhat and didn't go nearly at all, but he still came by sometimes. I told her I still didn't care to see him and she was like ok then you can tell me and we will go somewhere outside not to upset you. She didn't feel anything wrong with that. In her mind she just really found a friend.

How wrong that was

At this period, from the point my dog died, I decided I was done feeling down. I started taking care of stuff again. More housework, more Normal work to make some bank, and more trying for her, both emotionally and sexually, as much as I could give. I finally saw her tired and needing a vacation, and thought i could burden her no longer. I wanted, needed, to be the guy I know I am once more, and to get out of this constant feeling of feeling down. One could see this as lovebombing from seeing my relationshio go down a wrong path, but it really was not. I was in this attempt from the moment we moved in together alone about 1.5 years ago, but I also felt burdened from the betrayal of that one night they messed up and could not give it all. Still tried to give it my best though. And in these last two months I really tried being there for here, but she wouldn't even recognize the effort. She saw it, but it never registered to her. 

About a month ago, my gf calmly told me that she was thinking about the prospect of a polyamorous relationship. I asked if it was about my bestfriend, she said yeah. I shut that down, HARD. It was the first time since the incident showing clear intent and feelings, and wanted to shut it down as best as I could 

And it all boiled down to about 10 days ago. She told me that she loves me very much, but she doesn't know if that's enough for her anymore. I freaked out. I had a premonition, almost sure of what it was, but that's all she said. I kept on pressing her to tell me what's wrong, to communicate, to give us a chance to try harder, to go to therapy, and she kept rejecting all i said. Two days later, by bestfriend and I met up at a job and talked a bit, and he said that he has feelings for my gf and that he feels like he should take his distance from both of us. He said he loves us both very much, and doesn't want his feelings to cause a problem. I accepted that, appreciated his honesty and his mature approach about it, and bade him an emotional farewell. He said he would come by and tell my gf too. I went back home, and waited. When she came home she cried. She said she was sad. I asked if she had feelings too, she didn't answer. Next day I had work and came home a crying mess. Almost didn't make the day. I sat her down and we talked. Really, really talked, and she finally let me off the hook and told me she has feelings about my best friend. In the moment i was relieved. I finally knew what it was, clearly. The veil had been lifted and it was all up in the air. I was relieved. But the next morning was hell. I tried to ask her about her feelings. She said she loves me, but she loves him too. And that she doesn't see a future with me as much as she sees a future with him. 

I was shaken. Couldn't really believe what I was hearing. Up until 3 months ago we were frivolously talking about our future. We got a dog, god dammit. How could she suddenly change in 3 months from seeing and building a future with me, to feeling disappointed and letting 7.5 years of love just end. And what about all we dreamt of only weeks ago? She never gave me an indication besides what was mentioned above. Besides having him around often, that's all she showed me. She kept talking about stuff she wanted us to do, how we should paint the house, upcoming plans in a couple of months and how we should handle them, trips, everything. I got a motorcycle and just a month ago she got a helmet because she wanted to ride pillion with me. And it was colour and designed matched to mine as well. A mere MONTH before all this. She did however stop talking about some of her problems with our relationship after my dog died. I thought it was because she tried not to burden me but i was wrong. 

Then, 3 days ago, I opened her phone (I know, violation of privacy, sue me. She was hiding stuff) and i saw that she was STILL messaging my bestfriend and even exchanged spicy pics just the day before. You know, the day I was having an anxiety attack at work. I apologized for the way I found out, she accepted, but tried to figure out her feelings. Was it really love? Was it excitement? Did she mentally check out from our relationship and just find the next one? Was he just using her? Was she using him? I think I ended up with more questions than answers. And that asshole! He was saying stuff like ""yeah it's unethical to OP and it might be obsession, but what's wrong with that? That's how love works, i feel some way, and I act on it. If my mom died I would be upset and act on it, so why shouldn't I do it with this issue"". He found nothing wrong with sexting with his best friend's girlfriend because ""he has feelings"". Says is unethical to me but is excused due to the feelings. And of course he's not alone. She also did that, and she was active in those decisions. She started texting him after he took distance. So she is a cheater, and he is a snake. Of course, though we were talking about taking a break, some distance, but not breaking up, we decided it would maybe be best to pull the trigger and end it

I instantly removed him from my life. Removed him from socials, and only kept him in the work group chat for logistical reasons. But I can't for the life of me remove her. I can't hate her. She was my life, and honestly though stuff has happened this last year, and there \*were\* a couple problems before, I did choose her, and want to still be beside her. 

Don't get me wrong, I am very much hurt by her actions and even if she came back now I would need her to work hard to make this right, but I would definitely give us a try

Final part: after thoughts :

I like to divide in my mind the problem at hand as 3 different issues combined together in one big fumbled mess. It's a triad consisting of these:

1-We had problems from 7.5 years of love but also mini daily clashes and especially after living together that's magnified. But that to my eyes is always worth trying for. We never became toxic to each other in daily life, and were always calm and loving to each other. We cared for each other and showed it, but never really put in the correct effort to solve the issues, as in going to a licensed therapist or a couple's councilor to talk honestly and clearly with someone who could guide us to solving these issues in a loving and productive manner

2-Let's be honest. We got together \*young\*. Maybe it was bound for us to break up from the beginning, at least for a time. I was her first relationship, and she never really evolved her own self identity inside it. She grew, and she evolved from a great teen to a wonderful adult through it and everybody, \*everybody\* in our lives loves her, but she was molded by our relationship. Not from me being pushy about it, just that you naturally get some traits from your partner when in a relationship. She needed to stay alone a bit, gather experiences, do stupid stuff, cry, laugh, and find her own self identity. Sincerely in my eyes we are a perfect relationship, a perfect couple, for a tiny bit later in life, maybe 30, where we will be ready for a family, but not for right now where we need to gather experiences and learn our lessons. And again, I have been lucky to already have gathered a lot of it from an early age and wouldn't mind \*as much\* to settle, and I STILL struggle with it. Imagine with someone who feels they haven't found their self identity yet

3-The ex bestfriend. She got close to him -as a friend, at least in her mind (and maybe even his)- but she experienced stuff you usually do in a new relationships. Shopping, mini dates, coffe dates, game nights, board games, small trips. I was there for most of them since we usually went all together, but maybe she kind of cut me out in her head and focused on what \*he\* provided for her, even though it wasn't like this. He's the only one who's close to her in her life in a more close manner, since all other ""friends"" she has are just colleagues or generally people she doesn't socialize with. So more like just people she knows, not friends she can share deep feelings with. I think she finally felt a genuine connection that one would have with a friend and due to the other 2 reasons mentioned above applied and evolved it to actual feelings for him, or at least an idealized idea of him. 

Sincerely I'm not sure she truly wants him or just the idealized version if him. Cause the feeling of eros is the first that fades when life enters the relationship. The first moments are great. Activities, late night talks, passion, fun dates, getting to really know each other, but what happens when there's not enough money for rent and you have to cut back? What happens when life gets tough and the other person is not the sweet prince you fell in love with. In that moment eros, passion, leaves, and love perseveres. It takes effort to go through that point. How can she say that she dreams a life with him, when the feelings only recently appeared? She knew him from before, yeah, but she also knew me from before. She says that she feels how she felt about me when we started but 4 times as hard about him. How can this be in just 2 months. And even with dreams of the future with kids and stuff. And how can she abandon her previous love of her life with her new dog, and leave the home we were making. 

Anyway right now she's back at her parent's house. She moved out of mine. Of \*ours\*. Or at least slowly doing so, since she has a house worth of stuff which needs days to be moved completely, until which time is staying at my place. We both have appointments to psychologists, and we're both gonna stay alone for some time, or at least try to, and see how it goes. In my mind it's 99% sure that she's gonna jump into a relationship with him. I hope for her good that she at least waits and talks it up with therapist a bit before deciding to do so because she'll just be jumping from one problematic relationship to another. 

I love her. I love very much. It hurts very much since it kiiiiinda came out of nowhere for me. It didn't, but i didn't want to think it would reach this point. I know it's too soon and that I haven't even had time to really process my feelings, but I really want to at some point get it working together with her again. I'm not a kid, I know she has to get her mind sorted, get her life sorted before that, and I definitely need to work with myself, rediscover my active and happy personality that was buried for some time. Most will probably tell me to get a move and don't look back, but I don't think I will just let it go. I'm open to whatever chances life throws at me, and if I happen to meet a girl (or 10) then I won't stop myself from living it if it feels right for me, but I don't think I want to kill the dream of a married life with her. As parents of a happy family. I sincerely believe and want to believe that at some point after we both live a couple of stuff, that life will see that we're ready and bring us together and that then it'll work, as it did once before. We'll both get it out of our system, and we'll be clear minded to continue on. I think I can forgive her for how she treated me this last 2-4 months, though she must try, and i'm ready to meet again the new person that will become of her. She was wonderful in these last 14 years i've known her. I don't think she's acting with a sound mind these last months, and regardless of that, when we're ready with therapy i'd love to go to a theraoist together with her and just... Talk it out. Not to get together again, though always an option if we're both ready, but just to talk it out and end in in clear and good terms. We can't leave each other's lives completely, for some reasons, but regardless of the outcome I'd love to be okay with her and work with her in the times we're together. And if the time is right, even maybe see about us 

What's your opinion?


TL;DR:
my partner of 7 years and me dreamt of a life together, but had some issues in our otherwise extremely loving relationship, we grew slowly apart due to everyday stress, and my snake of a bestfriend and her have developed feelings for each other while we were still together. We might have needed to break up at some point regardless since we got together at an early age and both need more experiances in life before settling in together, but right now she's rejecting our relationship and the future we were dreaming up until very recently. Should I give up on my dream or should I keep in as a hope in the back side of my mind, while also not stopping myself from moving forward in life and perhaps meeting someone who fits me better. And if life does bring us together again, and we're ready and have forgiven each other, should I do it? ",1,1769709660.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer*, but I will read and evaluate all participants.  

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise more recent posts.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** “I don’t need him, I need you!”  
**A2)** “You konw what? I’ll give it to you for free”  
**A3)** “I don’t regret it: if I could go back, I’d do the same”  

**B1)** “Levati subito di lì!”  
**B2)** “Mi dici perché mai ti sei fissato su questo?”  
**B3)** “Quando non ce la si fa più, anche arrendersi va bene”  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)  
**Estimated answer time**: 1 day (for those submitting now)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all six sentences, I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes without evaluating.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of scores depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the exact range might change depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Just wanted to share the 4 things I did differently cause I see a lot of people struggling to get any traction.

1. The FB ""Multi-Post"" feature
Most people waste time posting in one group, waiting, then posting in another.
On mobile, when you share to a niche group (passive income, crypto, etc), FB often lets you ""Post to 10 other groups"" at the same time.
Use it. It’s native so it doesn't get flagged as spam, and you hit way more eyeballs in seconds.

2. Selling the ""Spend"" not the ""Rig""
Realized pretty quick that normal people don't get TH/s or charts.
I started posting screenshots of the virtual card or my balance instead. Showing you can actually buy coffee with the gains converts way better than tech specs. Makes it feel real.

3. The ""Profile"" Mistake (Crucial)
I had signups but zero buys at first. The issue? People get lost in the app.
If they buy without manually entering the discount ID in their settings, you get nothing.
Now I explicitly tell them: ""Go to SETTINGS > PROFILE and type the ID there BEFORE buying.""
Since I added that instruction, my active user count actually went up.

4. The Comment Algo
Don't just drop the info and bounce.
I reply to literally every question, even the simple ones. Every comment pushes the thread back up in the feed.

Anyway, hope this helps some of you maximize your returns.

Edit: added TL;DR 

So I have been going through some stuff lately. Warning, long, long post. TL;DR at the bottom 

Part 1: the love of my life

I have been with my ex partner for about 7.5 years, since she was 16 and me 17. We were schoolmates and knew each other for 5 years before we hit it off already. I had exited my last relationship of a year and a half for about 8 months before that due to toxicity between us, stemming mostly from incompatibility and some deep seated trauma in both of us, and in that period I tried stuff and hit it up with some girls, but nothing serious. I decided I wanted to be with someone again, but this time I m someone who better fitted me, and in my searching she drew my interest, and I got to know her and she frankly amazed me. She was (and still is) such a great person, with interests and passion, and I felt something greater than just some interest. It felt like she was... Extra special, you know?

And so we hit it off. We were dance partners already, so the chemistry slowly grew on its own, and he finally hit it off on a school trip where we got together. And ever since, I had the best relationship I could dream of. It started as it normally would with getting to know each other really well, going on fun activities, spending time together, sexy times, the works. We grew on each other, and really, \*really\* loved each other. We met each other's families, vacations, trips together with our dancing and our music teams, shared hobbies and interests, gaming, and slowly getting so close to one another where she spent more time at my house rather than hers.

She was also there for me at my lowest times in my life. Though I visited a psychologist for some time and solved some issues, I would say that it was mostly thanks to her that I overcame some issues like fear of abandonment due to my parents breaking up in my early teens and them being toxic and creating a toxic family enviroment for me and my brother. I was welcomed into her family where I saw a way better working systems of support and love between the members there, and began to see an example of how things could be. It brought hope to my heart, man! And I started from relatively early on, about 3-4 years on, of how growing old with this woman would feel. I started making dreams with her. I know i know, we're too young for stuff like that, and I agree with you, but we both started thinking about how it would be to raise a home together, a family, with a dog and have little pitter patter of feet running around us. Slowly she spent 5+ days straight at my home, and due to certain circumstamces I happened to have the opportunity to keep the family home to myself since everyone else moved away. And so I did, and she instantly moved in with me, making this house into a couple's home. It was true love, and it was amazing. We cared for my elderly dog, and lately even got a new puppy

Of course things were not all good. Like relationships, we had our issues. We sometimes fought, we disagreed on stuff, and we definitely were a bit different as persons, but for me that was not a bad thing. She is a very carefree girl who, on the one hand helped me enjoy situations a bit more and taught me to take my overthinking mind off of stuff for a little while, but that also means that she was carefree in some situations that warranted some more attention and seriousness. And me on the other hand, I was always thinking ahead so as to always be on top of things which has helped in many, many scenarios in these last 10 years where I had to be mature as an adult even though I was just a teenager, but it also meant that I would tend to be more serious in situations that didn't need it, being a killjoy sometimes, and most importantly, trying to ""help her"" grow up in some stuff that needed her to be mature about them, as in government stuff, uni, degrees and everyday commonsense in some bad stuff she did absentmindedly (e.g. she once forgot the dog in the apartment building elevator for like an hour and we got yelled at by neighbors), which may have sometimes come off as pushy or overbearing. 

Add to that that I am overweight and due to clinical depression lost part of my libido for about 3+ years, and that she is a fairly sexual person with kinks that I couldn't get behind like BDSM and CNC, which I of course didn't judge, but simply couldn't offer her. I tried as much as I could to give her good passionate hugging (hey Rslash) but of course it wasn't good enough for her, and I do realize that and wish I could have been better. I have kinks of my own that she can't offer me as well but I probably don't need it as much as her. And also some loss of affection from me mostly as the relationship went on, not because I didn't love her but because I grew tired with life. I gave her lots of affection, but for example after covid I stopped going dancing with her and she felt hurt, because to her eyes I was her ""dance partner in life"". At the time I couldn't manage at all, I was all up in my head with some other stuff that was troubling me and a toxic home situation with my family that I was living with.

It's just that, little pieces of tiredness between us that slowly chipped away at the passion of the relationship and made us feel a bit stale and closed in. The love was extremely much there, we loved (and still do) each other up to our heads, but the relationship started to feel like it stagnated and like we were 40 years old. It felt like we were on the right moment for a bit of an older couple to actually plan for marriage or kids, but we both felt a bit too young for that. I wanted it with her, i \*dreamt\* it with her, just maybe not in this exact time. And for her it must have been even worse, because at least I had the opportunity to love deeply before, to experience a breakup, to mess around unseriously with girls, and also for my personal life to figure out through the years who I am and who I want to be, having also competed in music competitions, been in bands, traveled part of the world through my work as a musician and my passion, found a job in my field, and becoming a volunteer firefighter and becoming a part of a group of people like me who understand the way I feel. 

For her, she lived a normal life up until graduation, and then simply existed in the premises of her relationship with me and the stuff we did together. I always told her she should open more and make an effort to be active in her own interests and her social life, but she never quite managed to do that. I tried to help her by introducing her to my music groups and social groups, and indeed through that we went on trips and made many experiences, but she never realy blossomed beyond that. It was mostly things we did together, just like that dance team we were a part of at the start of our relationship. After I exited the team due to personal reasons, she did too, although she didn't need or want to. She could have continued on her passion of dancing on her own even if she preferred it with me, I believe. And she didn't have any real friends that she talked with or made plans with, only people from those groups who interacted mainly with me and her by extension 

Part 2: the bestfriend

Enter throughout all that a third player, my uni bestfriend of 6 years who I felt very close from the beginning. We were there for each other, and have helped each other a lot through many stuff, like helping each other cope through family problems, listening to each other when one needed an ear, going out and making experiences, money issues like lending money when one needed to, and helping each other advance our careers in our industry by mutual support. I helped him a step up, and he did the next. That kinda thing. One of his main quirks, to put it bluntly, was that he is pretty choosy in his choice of women to date. He had an active relationship life when he lived in his village, but after turning 18 and going to the big city to get in university (where we met) he only had in all the years i've known him less than 10 relationships, all of which ended before long and who he didn't reach any significant level of intimacy, either sexually or emotionally. It always seemed weird with me, but I let him be and just mocked him for always attracting virgin girls instead of experianced ones like he said he wanted (as any friend should).

Through the years he ended up becoming an integral part of my social life. We ended up hanging around a lot, even when we weren't together we often played online games. It was fun. Slowly my gf started joing us in all that, and the relationship between all evolved to a kind of triad that felt pretty secure and fun to be in. We went on vacation together, we celebrated birthdays, we did group projects, many long nights of gaming, going drifting (guy had a bmw), and generally many stuff together. He was fun to be around, and I could see that he felt really well as well being part of this, just like my girl.

Part 3: the fuckening

As I was saying, slowly through the years the relationship with my gf was a bit strained due to daily life getting to the both of us, but we persevered. Sexually speaking we were in a closed relationship but with freedom of talking around online or maybe getting into threesomes or group stuff etc, but only if the other agree as well. We had done some stuff, and in 2 occasions the bestfriend was part of a bit of play as well. The limits were though that they were to do nothing alone with each other, and they kept that limit for most of our time knowing each other.

The first incident happened about a year and a half ago, where I had just fiercely fought with my brother about us not being able to handle each other as roommates, about morals and other stuff, and we ended up ""breaking up"" our roommate relationship and him leaving for a new home. It was a hard time for reasons I won't specify but that went hand to hand with my older trauma and the aforementioned toxic family relations after my dad exited the family and left my mom with 2 kids alone. Not precisely an abusive situation, but surely very bad emotions at play. So at this period my bestfriend visited my house (where my gf had only recently moved in for good) for a fun evening of board games and some alcoholic beverage mixing for them (I don't really drink alcohol). I had to leave for a work incident for about 2 hours, but would be back to rejoin them pretty soon. After it was handled, I came back to see them both sitting on MY bed, looking extremely upset and guilty, where they told my that they messed up and went over the limit and she gave him a handjob while he was touching her. I got very mad, and left the house for some clean air. I was severely upset, but I tend to be non confrontational for some reason, and to always go above and beyond and understand the reasons behind it. I sat them down, we talked, asked them precisely  how they thought they messed up, and explained how it made me feel. They both apologized profusely, and accepted all I had to say about it. I set some pretty clear boundaries about the limits of our relationship, mostly that he doesn't get to do anything with her ever again and that they are to stay purely platonical friends. They accepted and we moved on. Things ran relatively smoothly after that. Me and my gf continued getting our house to feel like home, and the bestfriend did his stuff and we all hanged around sometimes. Easy stuff.

The start of the end:

About 4 months ago, me and my partner decided to get a puppy, since senior dog had started deteriorating and I hoped the pup would inherit some of his good traits (success!). Sadly the old pup had cancer, and his days were numbered. About a month after we found out, it progressed to a stage where I needed to make a very tough decision. I was a mess at that time. Absolute mess. I woke up every day the last 2 weeks of it trying to find even a glimpse of hope, of him getting a bit better, but seeing him get weaker by the day. I was feeling like I was run over by a train. I was about to lose my doggo best friend of 14 years. I was \*crushed\*. The day I put him down, my heart ripped in two, and I buried one of those parts with him. I was holding him while the vet did the injection, and felt his breathing stop. Ruined, i'm telling you. Of course by this point I was unable to provide psychologically for my relationship, and I was not in a point of handling executive decision making.

Exactly after the day my dog died, my gf started visiting my bestfriend's house, or constantly bringing him to our house. For the first time ever our work programs aligned and we had 2 consecutive days of the week off, and could spend them together. I was in no position to do that, having just lost my dog, but in that time my gf seemed... Weird. Done with stuff. Tired of trying to carry the burden of my feelings. I totally get it, sucks to have a partner with such drama in his life, but in most cases... That's life. She had the luck to live a more stress free childhood age so I can't blame her for feeling tired having carried my up to my dog's death, she needed rest. By this time she had found a bestfriend in my bestfriend. They went shopping, car rides, coffee, mini dates, frankly. I wasn't blind, it stank to me. I told my gf that I wasn't very good about what I was seeing. She swore she just finally found a friend, someone who understands her in some parts that she has never felt understood. But I told her I still don't like it, and that in any case i'm her boyfriend and really need her to be here and want her company. She relented somewhat and didn't go nearly at all, but he still came by sometimes. I told her I still didn't care to see him and she was like ok then you can tell me and we will go somewhere outside not to upset you. She didn't feel anything wrong with that. In her mind she just really found a friend.

How wrong that was

At this period, from the point my dog died, I decided I was done feeling down. I started taking care of stuff again. More housework, more Normal work to make some bank, and more trying for her, both emotionally and sexually, as much as I could give. I finally saw her tired and needing a vacation, and thought i could burden her no longer. I wanted, needed, to be the guy I know I am once more, and to get out of this constant feeling of feeling down. One could see this as lovebombing from seeing my relationshio go down a wrong path, but it really was not. I was in this attempt from the moment we moved in together alone about 1.5 years ago, but I also felt burdened from the betrayal of that one night they messed up and could not give it all. Still tried to give it my best though. And in these last two months I really tried being there for here, but she wouldn't even recognize the effort. She saw it, but it never registered to her. 

About a month ago, my gf calmly told me that she was thinking about the prospect of a polyamorous relationship. I asked if it was about my bestfriend, she said yeah. I shut that down, HARD. It was the first time since the incident showing clear intent and feelings, and wanted to shut it down as best as I could 

And it all boiled down to about 10 days ago. She told me that she loves me very much, but she doesn't know if that's enough for her anymore. I freaked out. I had a premonition, almost sure of what it was, but that's all she said. I kept on pressing her to tell me what's wrong, to communicate, to give us a chance to try harder, to go to therapy, and she kept rejecting all i said. Two days later, by bestfriend and I met up at a job and talked a bit, and he said that he has feelings for my gf and that he feels like he should take his distance from both of us. He said he loves us both very much, and doesn't want his feelings to cause a problem. I accepted that, appreciated his honesty and his mature approach about it, and bade him an emotional farewell. He said he would come by and tell my gf too. I went back home, and waited. When she came home she cried. She said she was sad. I asked if she had feelings too, she didn't answer. Next day I had work and came home a crying mess. Almost didn't make the day. I sat her down and we talked. Really, really talked, and she finally let me off the hook and told me she has feelings about my best friend. In the moment i was relieved. I finally knew what it was, clearly. The veil had been lifted and it was all up in the air. I was relieved. But the next morning was hell. I tried to ask her about her feelings. She said she loves me, but she loves him too. And that she doesn't see a future with me as much as she sees a future with him. 

I was shaken. Couldn't really believe what I was hearing. Up until 3 months ago we were frivolously talking about our future. We got a dog, god dammit. How could she suddenly change in 3 months from seeing and building a future with me, to feeling disappointed and letting 7.5 years of love just end. And what about all we dreamt of only weeks ago? She never gave me an indication besides what was mentioned above. Besides having him around often, that's all she showed me. She kept talking about stuff she wanted us to do, how we should paint the house, upcoming plans in a couple of months and how we should handle them, trips, everything. I got a motorcycle and just a month ago she got a helmet because she wanted to ride pillion with me. And it was colour and designed matched to mine as well. A mere MONTH before all this. She did however stop talking about some of her problems with our relationship after my dog died. I thought it was because she tried not to burden me but i was wrong. 

Then, 3 days ago, I opened her phone (I know, violation of privacy, sue me. She was hiding stuff) and i saw that she was STILL messaging my bestfriend and even exchanged spicy pics just the day before. You know, the day I was having an anxiety attack at work. I apologized for the way I found out, she accepted, but tried to figure out her feelings. Was it really love? Was it excitement? Did she mentally check out from our relationship and just find the next one? Was he just using her? Was she using him? I think I ended up with more questions than answers. And that asshole! He was saying stuff like ""yeah it's unethical to OP and it might be obsession, but what's wrong with that? That's how love works, i feel some way, and I act on it. If my mom died I would be upset and act on it, so why shouldn't I do it with this issue"". He found nothing wrong with sexting with his best friend's girlfriend because ""he has feelings"". Says is unethical to me but is excused due to the feelings. And of course he's not alone. She also did that, and she was active in those decisions. She started texting him after he took distance. So she is a cheater, and he is a snake. Of course, though we were talking about taking a break, some distance, but not breaking up, we decided it would maybe be best to pull the trigger and end it

I instantly removed him from my life. Removed him from socials, and only kept him in the work group chat for logistical reasons. But I can't for the life of me remove her. I can't hate her. She was my life, and honestly though stuff has happened this last year, and there \*were\* a couple problems before, I did choose her, and want to still be beside her. 

Don't get me wrong, I am very much hurt by her actions and even if she came back now I would need her to work hard to make this right, but I would definitely give us a try

Final part: after thoughts :

I like to divide in my mind the problem at hand as 3 different issues combined together in one big fumbled mess. It's a triad consisting of these:

1-We had problems from 7.5 years of love but also mini daily clashes and especially after living together that's magnified. But that to my eyes is always worth trying for. We never became toxic to each other in daily life, and were always calm and loving to each other. We cared for each other and showed it, but never really put in the correct effort to solve the issues, as in going to a licensed therapist or a couple's councilor to talk honestly and clearly with someone who could guide us to solving these issues in a loving and productive manner

2-Let's be honest. We got together \*young\*. Maybe it was bound for us to break up from the beginning, at least for a time. I was her first relationship, and she never really evolved her own self identity inside it. She grew, and she evolved from a great teen to a wonderful adult through it and everybody, \*everybody\* in our lives loves her, but she was molded by our relationship. Not from me being pushy about it, just that you naturally get some traits from your partner when in a relationship. She needed to stay alone a bit, gather experiences, do stupid stuff, cry, laugh, and find her own self identity. Sincerely in my eyes we are a perfect relationship, a perfect couple, for a tiny bit later in life, maybe 30, where we will be ready for a family, but not for right now where we need to gather experiences and learn our lessons. And again, I have been lucky to already have gathered a lot of it from an early age and wouldn't mind \*as much\* to settle, and I STILL struggle with it. Imagine with someone who feels they haven't found their self identity yet

3-The ex bestfriend. She got close to him -as a friend, at least in her mind (and maybe even his)- but she experienced stuff you usually do in a new relationships. Shopping, mini dates, coffe dates, game nights, board games, small trips. I was there for most of them since we usually went all together, but maybe she kind of cut me out in her head and focused on what \*he\* provided for her, even though it wasn't like this. He's the only one who's close to her in her life in a more close manner, since all other ""friends"" she has are just colleagues or generally people she doesn't socialize with. So more like just people she knows, not friends she can share deep feelings with. I think she finally felt a genuine connection that one would have with a friend and due to the other 2 reasons mentioned above applied and evolved it to actual feelings for him, or at least an idealized idea of him. 

Sincerely I'm not sure she truly wants him or just the idealized version if him. Cause the feeling of eros is the first that fades when life enters the relationship. The first moments are great. Activities, late night talks, passion, fun dates, getting to really know each other, but what happens when there's not enough money for rent and you have to cut back? What happens when life gets tough and the other person is not the sweet prince you fell in love with. In that moment eros, passion, leaves, and love perseveres. It takes effort to go through that point. How can she say that she dreams a life with him, when the feelings only recently appeared? She knew him from before, yeah, but she also knew me from before. She says that she feels how she felt about me when we started but 4 times as hard about him. How can this be in just 2 months. And even with dreams of the future with kids and stuff. And how can she abandon her previous love of her life with her new dog, and leave the home we were making. 

Anyway right now she's back at her parent's house. She moved out of mine. Of \*ours\*. Or at least slowly doing so, since she has a house worth of stuff which needs days to be moved completely, until which time is staying at my place. We both have appointments to psychologists, and we're both gonna stay alone for some time, or at least try to, and see how it goes. In my mind it's 99% sure that she's gonna jump into a relationship with him. I hope for her good that she at least waits and talks it up with therapist a bit before deciding to do so because she'll just be jumping from one problematic relationship to another. 

I love her. I love very much. It hurts very much since it kiiiiinda came out of nowhere for me. It didn't, but i didn't want to think it would reach this point. I know it's too soon and that I haven't even had time to really process my feelings, but I really want to at some point get it working together with her again. I'm not a kid, I know she has to get her mind sorted, get her life sorted before that, and I definitely need to work with myself, rediscover my active and happy personality that was buried for some time. Most will probably tell me to get a move and don't look back, but I don't think I will just let it go. I'm open to whatever chances life throws at me, and if I happen to meet a girl (or 10) then I won't stop myself from living it if it feels right for me, but I don't think I want to kill the dream of a married life with her. As parents of a happy family. I sincerely believe and want to believe that at some point after we both live a couple of stuff, that life will see that we're ready and bring us together and that then it'll work, as it did once before. We'll both get it out of our system, and we'll be clear minded to continue on. I think I can forgive her for how she treated me this last 2-4 months, though she must try, and i'm ready to meet again the new person that will become of her. She was wonderful in these last 14 years i've known her. I don't think she's acting with a sound mind these last months, and regardless of that, when we're ready with therapy i'd love to go to a theraoist together with her and just... Talk it out. Not to get together again, though always an option if we're both ready, but just to talk it out and end in in clear and good terms. We can't leave each other's lives completely, for some reasons, but regardless of the outcome I'd love to be okay with her and work with her in the times we're together. And if the time is right, even maybe see about us 

What's your opinion?


TL;DR:
my partner of 7 years and me dreamt of a life together, but had some issues in our otherwise extremely loving relationship, we grew slowly apart due to everyday stress, and my snake of a bestfriend and her have developed feelings for each other while we were still together. We might have needed to break up at some point regardless since we got together at an early age and both need more experiances in life before settling in together, but right now she's rejecting our relationship and the future we were dreaming up until very recently. Should I give up on my dream or should I keep in as a hope in the back side of my mind, while also not stopping myself from moving forward in life and perhaps meeting someone who fits me better. And if life does bring us together again, and we're ready and have forgiven each other, should I do it? ",1,1769709403.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1qqfse1,https://archive.ph/bcUUh,Trump officials awarded Venezuela oil-sale contracts to firms tied to bribery,"Two global trading houses that brokered an opaque deal with the Trump administration this month to sell Venezuelan oil were previously prosecuted for bribery schemes involving oil sales elsewhere, court records show, underscoring concerns by anti-corruption experts and lawmakers that the arrangement is vulnerable to abuse.

The administration granted confidential licenses to Vitol and Trafigura in early January to sell Venezuelan oil with little independent oversight. The licenses come a year after the Trump administration gutted the foreign corrupt practices unit of the Justice Department, which brought charges against the two companies and their traders in 2020 and 2024.

The licenses were granted as part of an energy deal the United States pushed Venezuela to accept after ousting its autocratic president, Nicolás Maduro, in a military raid Jan. 3. They allow Vitol and Trafigura to buy tens of millions of barrels of oil in Venezuelan reserves that had been blocked by sanctions from being sold. They also allow the trading houses to trade crude that Venezuela’s state oil company or other firms pump while sanctions remain in place. President Donald Trump has said the sales will help stabilize Venezuela’s economy and benefit the U.S.

According to public records, a senior trader at Vitol donated $6 million to political committees supporting Trump’s 2024 election. Vitol has stressed the donations were made by the individual and not the company.

The bribery schemes were colorful and elaborate, according to court records. They involved code words such as “shoes” and “coffee,” shell entities, and fake contracts and invoices with Mexican and Ecuadorian state oil companies in the case of a Vitol trader who was convicted of bribery in 2024, four years after the company paid $135 million in criminal penalties to resolve accusations it bribed officials in Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil. That was not its only run-in with prosecutors.

The other company, Trafigura, had plotted with Brazilian oil company officials to route funds through shell companies and offshore accounts to conceal a bribery scheme that helped net it $61 million in profits, according to a 2024 federal plea agreement in which the company admitted guilt and agreed to fines and forfeitures totaling $126 million. It’s one of several past allegations against the company, including a corruption conviction last year in Switzerland on charges of having bribed an Angolan official for oil contracts. The company is appealing.

“Trump is taking advantage of firms that know how to circumvent regulation,” said Robert Bachmann, an analyst at Public Eye, a Swiss nongovernmental organization that investigates commodities traders. “They were previously hunted down by the U.S. Department of Justice,” but that “does not seem to matter” to the current administration.

Vitol said in an emailed statement that it has “enhanced” its anti-corruption “compliance procedures and controls” in accordance with its 2020 federal deferred prosecution agreement, resulting in the charges being dropped. “Vitol operates its business in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” the company wrote. “Any suggestion otherwise is incorrect.”

Trafigura did not respond to detailed questions. In a statement earlier this month, the company said it is helping facilitate the sale of Venezuelan oil “at the request of the U.S. government.”

Administration officials say Vitol and Trafigura — among the three largest oil trading firms in the world — are some of the only ones with the resources and expertise to execute the complicated trades quickly. Officials note that the firms paid for $500 million of Venezuelan oil up-front and that the proceeds have already made their way to Venezuelan banks, where they will be used to stabilize the economy and address citizens’ basic needs.

“If not for President Trump’s bold action and courageous leadership, Venezuela would still be controlled by narcoterrorist Maduro and Venezuelan oil would still be funding our foreign adversaries,” White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in an email. “The historic U.S.-Venezuela energy deal will restore prosperity and security in Venezuela, safeguarding the economic and national security interests of the United States.”

Trafigura’s and Vitol’s existing networks of tankers and storage facilities across the Caribbean made them an obvious choice to quickly move Venezuela crude, administration and industry officials said.

“They are probably among the few companies that can in short notice allocate such a large number of barrels — 30 million to 40 million — so it’s a very convenient way for the administration to solve what would have been a much more complex problem,” said Francisco Monaldi, director of the Latin American Energy Program at Rice University.

Administration officials stressed that the deal requires the firms to sell at least half the Venezuelan oil to U.S. buyers. Most of the rest is expected to be sold in India and other Asian markets, according to analysts who are tracking the shipments.

Separate from the bribery case, Trafigura agreed to pay $55 million in civil penalties to U.S. commodities trading regulators in June 2024 to resolve allegations that it acquired “material nonpublic information” about gasoline contracts, manipulated a benchmark fuel price and impeded potential whistleblowers. The following month, Vitol and another firm agreed to pay $50 million to settle allegations by the California attorney general that they “secretly worked together to tamper with and manipulate spot market prices for California gasoline.”

It is unknown how much the two companies could profit from the Venezuela deal, but it’s potentially far more lucrative than previously reported, according to a copy of Vitol’s license obtained by The Washington Post. The license permits trading other natural resources in Venezuela, including iron ore and agricultural products. It is valid through June 2027.

Vitol confirmed some broad contours of the Venezuelan deal in an email, including that it encompasses “natural resources” beyond oil. But it said both the license and Vitol’s contract with the Venezuelan state oil company — which is providing the fuel — are confidential.

Vitol and Trafigura are depositing their payments for the oil in a bank account in Qatar, according to the Vitol license. The structure of the deal could shield the money from creditors that have claims pending against Venezuela and its state-owned oil company, in alignment with an executive order Trump signed Jan. 9.

Administration officials say the funds will be used to benefit the Venezuelan people, with Trump controlling their disbursement. They say the interim government in Venezuela has met the conditions needed for the release of funds from the first oil sales, after cooperating with the White House on the energy deal.

Last week, Venezuela confirmed receipt of the first $300 million. The dollars were funneled through four authorized private banks in Venezuela and then directly offered to importers, largely for food and medical goods, according to people with knowledge of the transactions who spoke on the condition of anonymity because details have not been publicly disclosed. In an effort to limit corruption, the buyers had to have a unique alphanumeric identifier known as a SWIFT code with a traceable account, they said.

Qatari emissaries had been working to facilitate talks between the Venezuelan government and the Trump administration, and they had earned the confidence of both sides, according to people familiar with the conversations who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share details publicly.

Trump has indicated the U.S. could take a cut of the oil proceeds at some point, but that does not appear to be the arrangement with initial sales. The White House has been more focused on imposing rules that require U.S. firms to receive contracts to revive Venezuela’s rotting energy infrastructure and that give preference to U.S. oil firms interested in pumping there.

The United States’ taking control of sales of another nation’s oil and routing payments to an offshore account is not unprecedented, said Peter Harrell, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former White House adviser in trade and economics. The U.S. facilitated sales of Iraqi oil using foreign bank accounts in the 2000s, and earlier through the United Nations’ oil-for-food program in the 1990s. “There is also precedent for corruption scandals popping up around these schemes,” he said.

Both in the U.S. and Venezuela, secrecy over the deal has raised hackles.

“The Venezuelans are the owners of the oil, and we know nothing. There is no transparency,” said José Guerra, an economist and member of the Venezuelan opposition, in an interview. “In a normal condition, a sovereign country sells oil and the exact number of barrels and the price are known, and goes to the central bank. Again, right now, we know nothing.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said Trump’s control of how the money gets released to Venezuela gives the White House “leverage” to bring this oil back on the market without risking proceeds will be used for narco-terrorism and drug trafficking.

At home, congressional Democrats are demanding greater accountability.

“The Trump administration is funneling another country’s oil revenues into handpicked accounts with virtually no oversight,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts), the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement. “Congress cannot allow Trump to treat Venezuela’s oil profits like his personal slush fund.”

Warren and four other senators have launched an investigation seeking information from 15 large U.S. banks, including JPMorgan, to determine whether they were approached by the administration for help executing the deal. The license reviewed by The Post specifically authorizes JPMorgan to be involved in the purchase of Venezuelan oil, metals and agricultural products. The bank declined to comment.

The sales come after a U.S. blockade, which began in September, that crippled Venezuelan crude distribution. With storage facilities brimming, fears were growing that some wells would need to be shut off — a process that is costly and difficult to reverse.

Administration officials say other buyers will be invited to compete with Trafigura and Vitol to buy Venezuelan oil in the future, but there have been no concrete steps to grant other licenses, vexing other firms.

“Sanctions remain in place and no licenses have been issued,” said a person in the industry who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly about confidential conversations with the administration. “We can’t even go down there and look around or negotiate.”",2,1769709382.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

For context, I gravitated towards the Ninja Cafe Luxe  as portafilter coffee machine for a few reasons:

1. I’m a beginner to espresso machines 

2. It seems to have a lot of assistance in place to limit mistakes 

3. It does a lot of coffee drinks, not just espresso

4. Assisted/automated milk frothing

5. It genuinely just seems to be very good value for money when compared to the competition 

6. I essentially just want an easy and quick espresso based drink but with more involvement than a simple bean to cup

I specially opted for the 701/Pro because:

1. A lot of people say the built-in tamper alone is worth the upgrade (as well as the other features: better steam wand, larger milk jug, more settings etc)

2. I used the logic of “if I’m paying £400+ then I might as well go for the pro version”

Now that I’ve bought the machine though, I’m scared to open it and begin using it in case I realise I probably should’ve bought another machine and then be unable to return/refund this due to having used it etc (for any UK Redditors - I bought this specifically from Curry’s).

Another option I had thought about and considered was the Sage Barista Express Impress, especially with how highly regarded Sage generally are within the coffee/espresso community, but ended up opting for the Ninja over this due to how much more assistance you get (weighted grinding, barista assist, automated frothing etc), which would take a lot of the guess work out of this, while the Express Impress looks like it needs a lot of user skill and input in order to get a solid espresso. Or even the Sage Barista Touch Impress which is more on the pricey end but looks like something you wouldn’t go back from.

On top of all this, since buying the Ninja I feel like I’ve started to see a lot of negative news about it, with users reporting hugely inconsistent shots, always on the phone with Ninja, on their n’th replacement unit etc - so I’m beginning to overthink this whole thing and worried I might have bought wrong machine and should return for an alternative.

She does this thing where she clings on to new friends and ends up giving them all of her attention - constantly texts them, hangs out with them 2-3x a week for 6+ hours, grabs coffee for them, buys her kids gifts etc. I know there’s no cheating (at least from what I read on their texts next to her & based off of what she tells me). She just becomes so obsessed with them and then literally pours all of her energy into them. She’ll come home to me after not seeing me all day and snap at me or fall asleep or sit on her phone. We had this issue with another friend in the past but this friend was in love with her and it made me insanely jealous that her friend got the girlfriend I wanted while I got the friend version of my gf. She always likes to call me controlling and pull the “I just want ONE friend” card on me. It’s nothing about her friend and I am not controlling. I never say “you can’t” or “you’re not allowed to”. I simply just ask for effort, to be treated like a partner and to be prioritized. With having a DB, it hurts 100x more because I already don’t feel wanted because of that so imagine how I feel when her friends get all of her energy and I get whatever is left. It’s like she waters another garden and lets ours dry out. Don’t get me wrong, I am not perfect by any means and I don’t always deliver my emotions in the best way but god this all sucks.

We got into an argument about it last night and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t want to convince or remind someone to love me.

You know that person who's always *too* friendly? The one whose compliments feel like they're reading from a script? Yeah, I used to think I was being cynical for questioning their intentions. Turns out my gut was onto something. After diving deep into psychology research, books on manipulation, and podcasts about human behavior, I've learned that  nice  isn't always genuine. And the cost of ignoring these red flags? Your energy, your boundaries, and sometimes your sanity.

Here's what I've learned about spotting performative kindness before it becomes a problem.

**1. They're suspiciously agreeable about everything**

Genuinely kind people have opinions. They disagree sometimes. Fake nice people never do because they're managing an image, not building real connection. Dr. Harriet Braiker's research on people pleasing (she literally wrote the disease to please playbook) shows this stems from deep insecurity and need for external validation.

Real niceness includes healthy conflict. Fake niceness avoids it obsessively.

Watch for people who mirror your opinions constantly or change their stance depending on who's in the room. They're not being considerate, they're being calculated.

**2. Their kindness comes with invisible price tags**

This one's subtle but deadly. They do you favors you didn't ask for, then casually mention it later when they need something. Psychologist Robert Cialdini breaks this down brilliantly in *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* (literally THE book on manipulation tactics, won every psychology award imaginable, this guy's research is referenced everywhere). He calls it reciprocity manipulation.

Genuine people give freely. Fake nice people keep a mental ledger.

I started noticing this pattern everywhere once I learned about it. The coworker who brings you coffee unprompted then asks you to cover their shift. The friend who helps you move then guilt trips you about it six months later during an argument.

**3. They gossip under the guise of concern**

 I'm really worried about Sarah, she seems like she's struggling...  then proceeds to detail every perceived flaw. This is emotional manipulation wearing a concerned face. Brené Brown talks about this extensively in her work on vulnerability and trust. Real concern happens privately and directly. Fake concern happens behind people's backs, wrapped in worry language.

If they gossip to you, they gossip about you. Simple math.

The pattern is always the same. They frame cruel observations as care, criticism as concern. It's a way to bond through negativity while maintaining plausible deniability.

**4. They can't handle it when you succeed**

The compliment comes but it's wrapped in something else.  Congrats on the promotion, you must have worked the system right  or  wow you lost weight, finally.  Notice that sting? That's not an accident.

Dr. Ramani Durvasula's podcast  narcissism in everyday life  covers this extensively. Fake nice people need to be the helper, the superior one. Your success threatens that dynamic. So they subtly diminish it while appearing supportive.

Genuine people celebrate your wins without qualifying them. Fake nice people always add a  but  or redirect attention back to themselves.

**5. Their empathy is performative, not practical**

They'll post about mental health awareness but ghost you when you're actually struggling. They'll share charity posts but never volunteer. They care about being seen as caring, not actual caring.

This hit me hard when I read *The Gifts of Imperfection* by Brené Brown. She distinguishes between sympathy (I feel bad for you from a distance) and empathy (I'm here with you in this). Fake nice people traffic in sympathy because it's easier and looks good. Real kindness shows up in the messy, inconvenient moments.

For anyone wanting to go deeper into understanding manipulation patterns and building authentic connections, there's an AI-powered learning app called BeFreed that's actually pretty useful here. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned above, and expert insights on emotional intelligence to create personalized audio learning.

You can set specific goals like  recognize manipulative behavior patterns  or  build authentic relationships as someone who struggles with people-pleasing,  and it generates a structured learning plan with podcast-style content. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask questions to their virtual coach if something clicks or confuses you. Makes internalizing this psychology stuff way more practical than just reading about it once.

**6. They have different personalities depending on the audience**

The way they treat the waiter versus their boss tells you everything. Fake nice people adjust their personality based on perceived value of the person in front of them. It's exhausting to watch and probably exhausting to maintain.

Authentic people are basically the same across contexts. They might be more formal at work, sure, but their core character doesn't shift dramatically. If someone's personality changes completely depending on who's around, you're watching a performance, not meeting a person.

**Here's the thing about all this**

None of this means you should become paranoid or assume everyone's fake. Most people are doing their best with the emotional tools they have. But understanding these patterns helps you protect your energy and invest it in relationships that actually nourish you.

The difference between genuine and performative kindness isn't always obvious at first. Sometimes it takes months to see the patterns. That's okay. Trust takes time and so does spotting manipulation. Your gut usually knows before your brain catches up.

Also worth noting, a lot of fake nice behavior stems from survival mechanisms people developed in childhood or toxic environments. It's not always malicious, it's often just maladaptive. But that doesn't mean you have to tolerate it draining you.

If you're realizing you exhibit some of these traits yourself (I definitely caught myself in a few), that's actually a good sign. Self awareness is the first step toward authentic connection. The fact that you care enough to question your behavior means you're probably not the problem person you're worried about being.

Real kindness is sustainable. It doesn't require performance or payback. It exists because someone genuinely wants good things for you, not because they want something from you. Once you know the difference, you can't unsee it.",1,1769709091.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

I know there’s long-standing controversy about ties to Mars Hill Church and Mark Driscoll from around 2013–2014. From what I can tell, Storyville has denied being formally affiliated, but some owners or leaders were connected to Mars Hill at the time.

What gives me pause is that I can’t find any explicit public LGBTQ-affirming statements from Storyville. No Pride posts, no clear statements supporting LGBTQ staff or customers, nothing like that, even after years of controversy. Their branding leans heavily on “Love Everybody,” which is language Mars Hill used a lot. In that context, “love” meant believing same-sex relationships were sinful, opposing gay marriage, and supporting correction or discipline of LGBTQ people, sometimes including conversion therapy, while still framing those positions as morally loving.

I also spoke with a former barista who is gay and visibly so. He said he felt the owners didn’t like him as he was and that this contributed to him eventually leaving. That’s obviously anecdotal, but it stuck with me.

Given all that, it seems like if Storyville were affirming, they could easily and clearly say so, especially after all the scrutiny, rather than sticking with vague language.

I’m genuinely asking if anyone has seen explicit LGBTQ-affirming statements or actions from Storyville, has firsthand employee experiences positive or negative, or knows of anything more recent that clearly clarifies where they stand. I’m not looking to pile on, just trying to make an informed decision about where I spend my money.",0,1769708787.0,Seattle,19,0.44,False

So I have been going through some stuff lately. Warning, long, long post. TL;DR at the bottom 

Part 1: the love of my life

I have been with my ex partner for about 7.5 years, since she was 16 and me 17. We were schoolmates and knew each other for 5 years before we hit it off already. I had exited my last relationship of a year and a half for about 8 months before that due to toxicity between us, stemming mostly from incompatibility and some deep seated trauma in both of us, and in that period I tried stuff and hit it up with some girls, but nothing serious. I decided I wanted to be with someone again, but this time I m someone who better fitted me, and in my searching she drew my interest, and I got to know her and she frankly amazed me. She was (and still is) such a great person, with interests and passion, and I felt something greater than just some interest. It felt like she was... Extra special, you know?

And so we hit it off. We were dance partners already, so the chemistry slowly grew on its own, and he finally hit it off on a school trip where we got together. And ever since, I had the best relationship I could dream of. It started as it normally would with getting to know each other really well, going on fun activities, spending time together, sexy times, the works. We grew on each other, and really, \*really\* loved each other. We met each other's families, vacations, trips together with our dancing and our music teams, shared hobbies and interests, gaming, and slowly getting so close to one another where she spent more time at my house rather than hers.

She was also there for me at my lowest times in my life. Though I visited a psychologist for some time and solved some issues, I would say that it was mostly thanks to her that I overcame some issues like fear of abandonment due to my parents breaking up in my early teens and them being toxic and creating a toxic family enviroment for me and my brother. I was welcomed into her family where I saw a way better working systems of support and love between the members there, and began to see an example of how things could be. It brought hope to my heart, man! And I started from relatively early on, about 3-4 years on, of how growing old with this woman would feel. I started making dreams with her. I know i know, we're too young for stuff like that, and I agree with you, but we both started thinking about how it would be to raise a home together, a family, with a dog and have little pitter patter of feet running around us. Slowly she spent 5+ days straight at my home, and due to certain circumstamces I happened to have the opportunity to keep the family home to myself since everyone else moved away. And so I did, and she instantly moved in with me, making this house into a couple's home. It was true love, and it was amazing. We cared for my elderly dog, and lately even got a new puppy

Of course things were not all good. Like relationships, we had our issues. We sometimes fought, we disagreed on stuff, and we definitely were a bit different as persons, but for me that was not a bad thing. She is a very carefree girl who, on the one hand helped me enjoy situations a bit more and taught me to take my overthinking mind off of stuff for a little while, but that also means that she was carefree in some situations that warranted some more attention and seriousness. And me on the other hand, I was always thinking ahead so as to always be on top of things which has helped in many, many scenarios in these last 10 years where I had to be mature as an adult even though I was just a teenager, but it also meant that I would tend to be more serious in situations that didn't need it, being a killjoy sometimes, and most importantly, trying to ""help her"" grow up in some stuff that needed her to be mature about them, as in government stuff, uni, degrees and everyday commonsense in some bad stuff she did absentmindedly (e.g. she once forgot the dog in the apartment building elevator for like an hour and we got yelled at by neighbors), which may have sometimes come off as pushy or overbearing. 

Add to that that I am overweight and due to clinical depression lost part of my libido for about 3+ years, and that she is a fairly sexual person with kinks that I couldn't get behind like BDSM and CNC, which I of course didn't judge, but simply couldn't offer her. I tried as much as I could to give her good passionate hugging (hey Rslash) but of course it wasn't good enough for her, and I do realize that and wish I could have been better. I have kinks of my own that she can't offer me as well but I probably don't need it as much as her. And also some loss of affection from me mostly as the relationship went on, not because I didn't love her but because I grew tired with life. I gave her lots of affection, but for example after covid I stopped going dancing with her and she felt hurt, because to her eyes I was her ""dance partner in life"". At the time I couldn't manage at all, I was all up in my head with some other stuff that was troubling me and a toxic home situation with my family that I was living with.

It's just that, little pieces of tiredness between us that slowly chipped away at the passion of the relationship and made us feel a bit stale and closed in. The love was extremely much there, we loved (and still do) each other up to our heads, but the relationship started to feel like it stagnated and like we were 40 years old. It felt like we were on the right moment for a bit of an older couple to actually plan for marriage or kids, but we both felt a bit too young for that. I wanted it with her, i \*dreamt\* it with her, just maybe not in this exact time. And for her it must have been even worse, because at least I had the opportunity to love deeply before, to experience a breakup, to mess around unseriously with girls, and also for my personal life to figure out through the years who I am and who I want to be, having also competed in music competitions, been in bands, traveled part of the world through my work as a musician and my passion, found a job in my field, and becoming a volunteer firefighter and becoming a part of a group of people like me who understand the way I feel. 

For her, she lived a normal life up until graduation, and then simply existed in the premises of her relationship with me and the stuff we did together. I always told her she should open more and make an effort to be active in her own interests and her social life, but she never quite managed to do that. I tried to help her by introducing her to my music groups and social groups, and indeed through that we went on trips and made many experiences, but she never realy blossomed beyond that. It was mostly things we did together, just like that dance team we were a part of at the start of our relationship. After I exited the team due to personal reasons, she did too, although she didn't need or want to. She could have continued on her passion of dancing on her own even if she preferred it with me, I believe. And she didn't have any real friends that she talked with or made plans with, only people from those groups who interacted mainly with me and her by extension 

Part 2: the bestfriend

Enter throughout all that a third player, my uni bestfriend of 6 years who I felt very close from the beginning. We were there for each other, and have helped each other a lot through many stuff, like helping each other cope through family problems, listening to each other when one needed an ear, going out and making experiences, money issues like lending money when one needed to, and helping each other advance our careers in our industry by mutual support. I helped him a step up, and he did the next. That kinda thing. One of his main quirks, to put it bluntly, was that he is pretty choosy in his choice of women to date. He had an active relationship life when he lived in his village, but after turning 18 and going to the big city to get in university (where we met) he only had in all the years i've known him less than 10 relationships, all of which ended before long and who he didn't reach any significant level of intimacy, either sexually or emotionally. It always seemed weird with me, but I let him be and just mocked him for always attracting virgin girls instead of experianced ones like he said he wanted (as any friend should).

Through the years he ended up becoming an integral part of my social life. We ended up hanging around a lot, even when we weren't together we often played online games. It was fun. Slowly my gf started joing us in all that, and the relationship between all evolved to a kind of triad that felt pretty secure and fun to be in. We went on vacation together, we celebrated birthdays, we did group projects, many long nights of gaming, going drifting (guy had a bmw), and generally many stuff together. He was fun to be around, and I could see that he felt really well as well being part of this, just like my girl.

Part 3: the fuckening

As I was saying, slowly through the years the relationship with my gf was a bit strained due to daily life getting to the both of us, but we persevered. Sexually speaking we were in a closed relationship but with freedom of talking around online or maybe getting into threesomes or group stuff etc, but only if the other agree as well. We had done some stuff, and in 2 occasions the bestfriend was part of a bit of play as well. The limits were though that they were to do nothing alone with each other, and they kept that limit for most of our time knowing each other.

The first incident happened about a year and a half ago, where I had just fiercely fought with my brother about us not being able to handle each other as roommates, about morals and other stuff, and we ended up ""breaking up"" our roommate relationship and him leaving for a new home. It was a hard time for reasons I won't specify but that went hand to hand with my older trauma and the aforementioned toxic family relations after my dad exited the family and left my mom with 2 kids alone. Not precisely an abusive situation, but surely very bad emotions at play. So at this period my bestfriend visited my house (where my gf had only recently moved in for good) for a fun evening of board games and some alcoholic beverage mixing for them (I don't really drink alcohol). I had to leave for a work incident for about 2 hours, but would be back to rejoin them pretty soon. After it was handled, I came back to see them both sitting on MY bed, looking extremely upset and guilty, where they told my that they messed up and went over the limit and she gave him a handjob while he was touching her. I got very mad, and left the house for some clean air. I was severely upset, but I tend to be non confrontational for some reason, and to always go above and beyond and understand the reasons behind it. I sat them down, we talked, asked them precisely  how they thought they messed up, and explained how it made me feel. They both apologized profusely, and accepted all I had to say about it. I set some pretty clear boundaries about the limits of our relationship, mostly that he doesn't get to do anything with her ever again and that they are to stay purely platonical friends. They accepted and we moved on. Things ran relatively smoothly after that. Me and my gf continued getting our house to feel like home, and the bestfriend did his stuff and we all hanged around sometimes. Easy stuff.

The start of the end:

About 4 months ago, me and my partner decided to get a puppy, since senior dog had started deteriorating and I hoped the pup would inherit some of his good traits (success!). Sadly the old pup had cancer, and his days were numbered. About a month after we found out, it progressed to a stage where I needed to make a very tough decision. I was a mess at that time. Absolute mess. I woke up every day the last 2 weeks of it trying to find even a glimpse of hope, of him getting a bit better, but seeing him get weaker by the day. I was feeling like I was run over by a train. I was about to lose my doggo best friend of 14 years. I was \*crushed\*. The day I put him down, my heart ripped in two, and I buried one of those parts with him. I was holding him while the vet did the injection, and felt his breathing stop. Ruined, i'm telling you. Of course by this point I was unable to provide psychologically for my relationship, and I was not in a point of handling executive decision making.

Exactly after the day my dog died, my gf started visiting my bestfriend's house, or constantly bringing him to our house. For the first time ever our work programs aligned and we had 2 consecutive days of the week off, and could spend them together. I was in no position to do that, having just lost my dog, but in that time my gf seemed... Weird. Done with stuff. Tired of trying to carry the burden of my feelings. I totally get it, sucks to have a partner with such drama in his life, but in most cases... That's life. She had the luck to live a more stress free childhood age so I can't blame her for feeling tired having carried my up to my dog's death, she needed rest. By this time she had found a bestfriend in my bestfriend. They went shopping, car rides, coffee, mini dates, frankly. I wasn't blind, it stank to me. I told my gf that I wasn't very good about what I was seeing. She swore she just finally found a friend, someone who understands her in some parts that she has never felt understood. But I told her I still don't like it, and that in any case i'm her boyfriend and really need her to be here and want her company. She relented somewhat and didn't go nearly at all, but he still came by sometimes. I told her I still didn't care to see him and she was like ok then you can tell me and we will go somewhere outside not to upset you. She didn't feel anything wrong with that. In her mind she just really found a friend.

How wrong that was

At this period, from the point my dog died, I decided I was done feeling down. I started taking care of stuff again. More housework, more Normal work to make some bank, and more trying for her, both emotionally and sexually, as much as I could give. I finally saw her tired and needing a vacation, and thought i could burden her no longer. I wanted, needed, to be the guy I know I am once more, and to get out of this constant feeling of feeling down. One could see this as lovebombing from seeing my relationshio go down a wrong path, but it really was not. I was in this attempt from the moment we moved in together alone about 1.5 years ago, but I also felt burdened from the betrayal of that one night they messed up and could not give it all. Still tried to give it my best though. And in these last two months I really tried being there for here, but she wouldn't even recognize the effort. She saw it, but it never registered to her. 

About a month ago, my gf calmly told me that she was thinking about the prospect of a polyamorous relationship. I asked if it was about my bestfriend, she said yeah. I shut that down, HARD. It was the first time since the incident showing clear intent and feelings, and wanted to shut it down as best as I could 

And it all boiled down to about 10 days ago. She told me that she loves me very much, but she doesn't know if that's enough for her anymore. I freaked out. I had a premonition, almost sure of what it was, but that's all she said. I kept on pressing her to tell me what's wrong, to communicate, to give us a chance to try harder, to go to therapy, and she kept rejecting all i said. Two days later, by bestfriend and I met up at a job and talked a bit, and he said that he has feelings for my gf and that he feels like he should take his distance from both of us. He said he loves us both very much, and doesn't want his feelings to cause a problem. I accepted that, appreciated his honesty and his mature approach about it, and bade him an emotional farewell. He said he would come by and tell my gf too. I went back home, and waited. When she came home she cried. She said she was sad. I asked if she had feelings too, she didn't answer. Next day I had work and came home a crying mess. Almost didn't make the day. I sat her down and we talked. Really, really talked, and she finally let me off the hook and told me she has feelings about my best friend. In the moment i was relieved. I finally knew what it was, clearly. The veil had been lifted and it was all up in the air. I was relieved. But the next morning was hell. I tried to ask her about her feelings. She said she loves me, but she loves him too. And that she doesn't see a future with me as much as she sees a future with him. 

I was shaken. Couldn't really believe what I was hearing. Up until 3 months ago we were frivolously talking about our future. We got a dog, god dammit. How could she suddenly change in 3 months from seeing and building a future with me, to feeling disappointed and letting 7.5 years of love just end. And what about all we dreamt of only weeks ago? She never gave me an indication besides what was mentioned above. Besides having him around often, that's all she showed me. She kept talking about stuff she wanted us to do, how we should paint the house, upcoming plans in a couple of months and how we should handle them, trips, everything. I got a motorcycle and just a month ago she got a helmet because she wanted to ride pillion with me. And it was colour and designed matched to mine as well. A mere MONTH before all this. She did however stop talking about some of her problems with our relationship after my dog died. I thought it was because she tried not to burden me but i was wrong. 

Then, 3 days ago, I opened her phone (I know, violation of privacy, sue me. She was hiding stuff) and i saw that she was STILL messaging my bestfriend and even exchanged spicy pics just the day before. You know, the day I was having an anxiety attack at work. I apologized for the way I found out, she accepted, but tried to figure out her feelings. Was it really love? Was it excitement? Did she mentally check out from our relationship and just find the next one? Was he just using her? Was she using him? I think I ended up with more questions than answers. And that asshole! He was saying stuff like ""yeah it's unethical to OP and it might be obsession, but what's wrong with that? That's how love works, i feel some way, and I act on it. If my mom died I would be upset and act on it, so why shouldn't I do it with this issue"". He found nothing wrong with sexting with his best friend's girlfriend because ""he has feelings"". Says is unethical to me but is excused due to the feelings. And of course he's not alone. She also did that, and she was active in those decisions. She started texting him after he took distance. So she is a cheater, and he is a snake. Of course, though we were talking about taking a break, some distance, but not breaking up, we decided it would maybe be best to pull the trigger and end it

I instantly removed him from my life. Removed him from socials, and only kept him in the work group chat for logistical reasons. But I can't for the life of me remove her. I can't hate her. She was my life, and honestly though stuff has happened this last year, and there \*were\* a couple problems before, I did choose her, and want to still be beside her. 

Don't get me wrong, I am very much hurt by her actions and even if she came back now I would need her to work hard to make this right, but I would definitely give us a try

Final part: after thoughts :

I like to divide in my mind the problem at hand as 3 different issues combined together in one big fumbled mess. It's a triad consisting of these:

1-We had problems from 7.5 years of love but also mini daily clashes and especially after living together that's magnified. But that to my eyes is always worth trying for. We never became toxic to each other in daily life, and were always calm and loving to each other. We cared for each other and showed it, but never really put in the correct effort to solve the issues, as in going to a licensed therapist or a couple's councilor to talk honestly and clearly with someone who could guide us to solving these issues in a loving and productive manner

2-Let's be honest. We got together \*young\*. Maybe it was bound for us to break up from the beginning, at least for a time. I was her first relationship, and she never really evolved her own self identity inside it. She grew, and she evolved from a great teen to a wonderful adult through it and everybody, \*everybody\* in our lives loves her, but she was molded by our relationship. Not from me being pushy about it, just that you naturally get some traits from your partner when in a relationship. She needed to stay alone a bit, gather experiences, do stupid stuff, cry, laugh, and find her own self identity. Sincerely in my eyes we are a perfect relationship, a perfect couple, for a tiny bit later in life, maybe 30, where we will be ready for a family, but not for right now where we need to gather experiences and learn our lessons. And again, I have been lucky to already have gathered a lot of it from an early age and wouldn't mind \*as much\* to settle, and I STILL struggle with it. Imagine with someone who feels they haven't found their self identity yet

3-The ex bestfriend. She got close to him -as a friend, at least in her mind (and maybe even his)- but she experienced stuff you usually do in a new relationships. Shopping, mini dates, coffe dates, game nights, board games, small trips. I was there for most of them since we usually went all together, but maybe she kind of cut me out in her head and focused on what \*he\* provided for her, even though it wasn't like this. He's the only one who's close to her in her life in a more close manner, since all other ""friends"" she has are just colleagues or generally people she doesn't socialize with. So more like just people she knows, not friends she can share deep feelings with. I think she finally felt a genuine connection that one would have with a friend and due to the other 2 reasons mentioned above applied and evolved it to actual feelings for him, or at least an idealized idea of him. 

Sincerely I'm not sure she truly wants him or just the idealized version if him. Cause the feeling of eros is the first that fades when life enters the relationship. The first moments are great. Activities, late night talks, passion, fun dates, getting to really know each other, but what happens when there's not enough money for rent and you have to cut back? What happens when life gets tough and the other person is not the sweet prince you fell in love with. In that moment eros, passion, leaves, and love perseveres. It takes effort to go through that point. How can she say that she dreams a life with him, when the feelings only recently appeared? She knew him from before, yeah, but she also knew me from before. She says that she feels how she felt about me when we started but 4 times as hard about him. How can this be in just 2 months. And even with dreams of the future with kids and stuff. And how can she abandon her previous love of her life with her new dog, and leave the home we were making. 

Anyway right now she's back at her parent's house. She moved out of mine. Of \*ours\*. Or at least slowly doing so, since she has a house worth of stuff which needs days to be moved completely, until which time is staying at my place. We both have appointments to psychologists, and we're both gonna stay alone for some time, or at least try to, and see how it goes. In my mind it's 99% sure that she's gonna jump into a relationship with him. I hope for her good that she at least waits and talks it up with therapist a bit before deciding to do so because she'll just be jumping from one problematic relationship to another. 

I love her. I love very much. It hurts very much since it kiiiiinda came out of nowhere for me. It didn't, but i didn't want to think it would reach this point. I know it's too soon and that I haven't even had time to really process my feelings, but I really want to at some point get it working together with her again. I'm not a kid, I know she has to get her mind sorted, get her life sorted before that, and I definitely need to work with myself, rediscover my active and happy personality that was buried for some time. Most will probably tell me to get a move and don't look back, but I don't think I will just let it go. I'm open to whatever chances life throws at me, and if I happen to meet a girl (or 10) then I won't stop myself from living it if it feels right for me, but I don't think I want to kill the dream of a married life with her. As parents of a happy family. I sincerely believe and want to believe that at some point after we both live a couple of stuff, that life will see that we're ready and bring us together and that then it'll work, as it did once before. We'll both get it out of our system, and we'll be clear minded to continue on. I think I can forgive her for how she treated me this last 2-4 months, though she must try, and i'm ready to meet again the new person that will become of her. She was wonderful in these last 14 years i've known her. I don't think she's acting with a sound mind these last months, and regardless of that, when we're ready with therapy i'd love to go to a theraoist together with her and just... Talk it out. Not to get together again, though always an option if we're both ready, but just to talk it out and end in in clear and good terms. We can't leave each other's lives completely, for some reasons, but regardless of the outcome I'd love to be okay with her and work with her in the times we're together. And if the time is right, even maybe see about us 

What's your opinion?


TL;DR:
my partner of 7 years and me dreamt of a life together, but had some issues in our otherwise extremely loving relationship, we grew slowly apart due to everyday stress, and my snake of a bestfriend and her have developed feelings for each other while we were still together. We might have needed to break up at some point regardless since we got together at an early age and both need more experiances in life before settling in together, but right now she's rejecting our relationship and the future we were dreaming up until very recently. Should I give up on my dream or should I keep in as a hope in the back side of my mind, while also not stopping myself from moving forward in life and perhaps meeting someone who fits me better. And if life does bring us together again, and we're ready and have forgiven each other, should I do it? ",1,1769708481.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

1qqf8ja,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1qqf8ja/a_revision_of_how_i_entered_individuation_did_i/,A revision of how i entered individuation. Did i miss anything?,"London observer archetype, anima, messianic archetype, snake exiting mouth vision, dogma experience, wedding dream, dog biting my forearm, spider descending towards my face dream (revelation of my own fear of creativity), the journaling experience. 

I laid out the contents so i don't forget what to mention. I probably have more but i won't check the journal i wrote these things in cos I'm a bit afraid of doing that 😅.  Straight into it - I entered a self inflicted phase that required me to learn enterprise skills at a fast rate, or atleast to me, and i unintentionally triggered an individuation process. Let me tell you how i did this; the study process for the skills i was learning was not an easy one so i decided that I'd load 4-6 cups of coffee every morning to retain majority of the info at crackhead speed. Well that was not a good idea. I deprived myself of sleep for 3 consecutive days and this is where the vivid dreams came from. Side mention - sleep deprivation is fucking excruciating. My strict daily routine did not make this any easier. I had to put my phone down before 5pm, read a book from 7 until 8pm, then go to sleep immediately after. The first night was hell. Because i couldn't rely on anything to distract me i had to endure for what i thought would be a few more hours. A ""few more hours"" turned into witnessing the sun rise from my bed with no sleep. This happens for 2 more days, then i decided I'd cut out the coffee or reduce it to 2/3 cups depending on how i feel. On day 4 i had the most memorable dream and most important. I thought that cutting out the coffee would guarantee a full nap on day 4 but i was wrong. I couldn't get a nap in until 4am. The dream - i was at home standing in a passage way, looking directly towards the flat i stayed alone in when i was around 15-16. Note, that period was one of the darkest for me mentally as i was very depressed, and at some point thought about...yea. 2 women walked out of that room, one i know (she was my math/science tutor, the other i did not know. The one i didn't know had a clipboard and she had notes on it. They were both in lab coats for some reason then this lady with a clipboard says to me, ""you have a mind infection"" ? I was confused and i sure gave her the look of someone confused so she said, ""we evaluated you and we've come to the conclusion that your mind has been infected"" they didn't say in what way and i walked them out the gate. This unknown lady that told me my mind was infected would show up later in a different medium of communication thus i called her my anima. I was already aware of Carl Jung before this so i thought to myself that it would be a good idea to communicate with my unconscious via journaling. 
So that day at around 4-6 pm, i opened my journal and started dialogue. This might sound crazy, but i asked this supposed anima questions and i would answer them for it...yes, i felt discomfort in doing this when i was answering her side then, it said, ""you think you're going crazy by doing this. No one is here to judge you"" 

( i had to open the journal to write accurate stuff and this is still mind bending) but i digress.   I asked what it meant by mind infection and she replied ""you don't know what you're doing"" 
 i would love to write the entire dialogue down but it's lengthy. The precision is crazy though so I'll write the parts that stand out. 

I said, ""I'm in a transformative period of life right now, are you my old self trying to bring me down?"" 
She goes, ""I am you, believe or not"" then i had a vision of me at the age of 5/6 with this anima figure holding my hand and my mother holding the other. This was tied to a memory because i remember that day. Prior to this i couldn't recall any minor memories of myself below the age of 7. 
She then says, ""I'm not here to haunt you, just listen to me. Open the floodgates and you'll get where you're supposed to be"" ...then the dialogue ended. I didn't choose to end it, the line of reasoning or voice that helped me write down her part just stopped communicating. I wasn't hearing any real voices if you're concerned just an internal one that guided me. 

London watcher - observer archetype. I saw myself looking directly out of a window located in London mid dialogue with the anima. The anima told me to be guided by the observational thought structure of this observer archetype to have a broad perspective of what's going on and not be lost in translation because i was in the middle of all this. I started viewing the experience from a broader perspective and i caught alot by choosing to do so. 

Then I remembered something: 

Messianic archetype - A few months before this experience, i had a dream of Jesus and myself standing under the roadway and on metal support right below the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco. He asked me ""what has come to pass?"" There are some symbols that interested me in this dream. There was deep water below us (deep water in this realm of reasoning resembles the unconscious) I was holding on tight to the support because i was afraid of falling from that height into the water (catch that), the bridge itself resembles something to me. It's a path for moving vehicles (i was in a state of transformation. Moving from one side of the map to another...This manifested in my indoctrination too. I was Christian for most of my life until a few months before this dream)
 The question itself ""what has come to pass?"" (This was clearly an invitation to self-reflect. What did i do months after? I entered individuation or integration) 

The snake exit - A few hours after the dialogue with my anima had passed. I went to grab food and as I was eating, for 3 seconds, my eyes completely ignored what i was focused on and i saw, with my minds eye, a visual of a black snake exiting a person's mouth. It looked painful by the way he grabbed his throat..I was that person. I saw myself having a snake exit my mouth. 
I went to my room and opened dialogue with my anima again. The conclusion was that i was exiling truth. I'll be honest, after the first dialogue i kinda told myself i wouldn't continue to communicate with my unconscious - this maps to the truth exile statement. Was i exiling truth by wanting to block communication with my unconscious?

Dog biting my forearm - a few days after the anima dialogue. I had a dream of my friend and i walking around a neighborhood i grew up in (familiar territory > linked to the ego.) at night. Randomly out of nowhere 2 dogs charge at us, one attacks my friend, the other jumps and bites my forearm. I tried to wrestle it but i couldn't so i pulled out a gun and shot it in the face. I think that dogs are the symbol of loyalty and companionship. At the very beginning of all this i was afraid of going insane, i contemplated stopping so as to not disturb my ego. Those dogs in my dream were my ego,  self-companionship, loyalty to self, biting me for not stopping a process that it thought was threatening. This is eye opening cos I'm gaining new understanding by doing this. This same dog then acts differently around me in a different dream further down the line for integrating the lessons in a dream i titled ""the wedding"" 

Let me add an interpretation i wrote down when i pieced together the mind infection dream - Me; ""I've realized now that when the anima said i had all of this wrong, she might've been referring to an old belief i had about individuation - the ego should die. No the ego can't be fought. Instead, i have to ground my ego by nurturing it and allowing it to integrate insight that it receives from the different parts of my mind.""  I have learnt so much about why i have certain goals now. I understand what my trauma has caused me to seek, and why. For example one of the things my shadow self is chasing, is authority. The reason I want authority is because i was stripped of control growing up. I had no say in what was happening to me and the way i was treated so the repair for that shows up as control to me. I want to control what i experience, what my life looks like, who gets access to me, and i certainly want authority over systems. That's a softer way of saying it. What i was really going to say is governing authority over people. I didn't learn this when i was doing shadow work though. It came months and months after. That's where i am right now. 

The final dream : this one has the most symbolism but i won't go over the symbols. It's very rich
Dogma dream - I'm in an ancient Egyptian city and the first group of living organisms that approach me were these blue giants with sphinx faces. They had human bodies and were about 8 feet tall. I was walking with 6 of these giants, i was the smallest one among them, among the civilization. We walked past a group of similar giants and they asked my group, ""Are you taking him to Dogma?"" My group replied yes then that group said, ""Dogma is not happy with this""  Mind you, i had no idea what the word dogma meant before this dream and I'm sure as hell i never heard it either. 1 giant out of the group we were walking with enters this small room with me and it had what appeared to me as cleansing apparatus. I sat down and asked it who Dogma was and i figured in that moment that it was an authority in the city that had immense power. The dream faded after that question. I'm not lying to you when i say this. I could feel the weight of the name. When i woke up from the dream i googled the meaning of the word and to my surprise the word meant a set of beliefs or principles that are accepted by a group as absolutely true, without question. However the dream faded before i could be taken to his temple. So i thought to myself that i wasn't ready to meet the archetype that engineered and governed my belief system because if i was, the dream would've led me to him. 

The wedding dream - This wedding had no more than 15 people in attendance. I saw the same dog that bit me, run towards me and i thought i was going to get bitten as previous but it settled down and let me touch it. Did the wedding represent a union of ego and the unconscious?

I've met dogma in different ways months after the dream. I have no rigid beliefs that are tying me down, at least to my knowledge. This rigidity of beliefs is very swift, it can cause you to self-sabotage things in many ways. It's funny how i wrote in my journal that was not going to continue the shadow work process. I didn't on paper but it continued 

 I could've missed interpretation of some things. Help me where you can

Hurricane,Utah 
Friday, March 15, 2024 
6:00 a.m

It was the beginning of another day in the famous city of Hurricane. Sunlight softly reflected off the old vintage buildings as people hurried out of their homes toward work, and the neon signs of restaurants and diners flickered off one by one.
In the old suburbs of the city, in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, stood an old house—large, yet with a welcoming appearance.

In one of the rooms of this house, where sunlight delicately filtered through the curtains, the space was filled with posters and vintage objects. There, Emilly slept deeply in her bed, surrounded by stuffed animals and cozy blankets. Then, the persistent sound of the alarm clock echoed through the room, accompanied by the meow of Kitty, her black cat, waiting outside the window.
The young woman finally opened her eyes and reached out to turn off the alarm.

—Okay, okay… I’m awake, Kitty— murmured Emilly, her voice still heavy with sleep, as she stroked the cat’s head.

She slowly sat up in bed, her long, voluminous golden hair cascading over her shoulders. She picked up her phone from the nightstand to check her reminders and realized she had a meeting scheduled in two hours at the famous Freddy's Family Dinner.

—I still can’t believe I got an offer from such a big company like Fazbear Entertainment. I wonder what the owner himself wants to talk to me about— Emilly wondered aloud, a mix of curiosity and anxiety in her voice.

She then slowly got up and walked to the bathroom to get ready and take her medication.
For several long minutes, Emilly stared at her reflection in the mirror. The scars on her body drew attention—deep, irregular, unpleasant marks spread across nearly all her skin, except her face. They were silent reminders of a past she couldn’t fully recall and one of the main reasons she had suffered bullying at the old psychiatric orphanage where she had lived before finally leaving upon turning eighteen.

These thoughts began to fade when Kitty started rubbing around her legs, purring softly.
—Are you hungry, Kitty? I’ll put your food out in a moment, little glutton. I have a feeling today’s going to be a very long day— said Emilly, letting out a small smile after swallowing her last pills.



Freddy's Family Dinner 
Friday,March 15, 2024
7:50 a.m.

The day was sunny with only a few clouds in the sky. Emilly rode her small red scooter unhurriedly toward the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, still lost in thought about the email she had received from William Terrence Afton, the current owner of Fazbear Entertainment, a few days earlier. Of course, he was one of the four original co-founders of the company, alongside Henry Joel Emily, Edwin Davis Murray, and Fiona Margaret Murray. Yet, deep inside, Emilly felt an overwhelming discomfort mixed with fear whenever she saw or read about Mr. Afton.

She had often heard stories from some of the town’s older residents about the tragedies and incidents that had occurred at the company’s establishments during the seventies, eighties, and nineties—ranging from disappearances and murders of children and employees to bodies found inside animatronic suits. Although the police never caught the culprit, these cases were quietly shelved due to lack of evidence and company bribery. Over time, they gave rise to urban legends and rumors that the restaurants were haunted, though eventually, these tragedies were mostly forgotten, remembered only as tales to scare children.

As she thought about this, Emilly finally caught sight of the façade of the famous Freddy's Family Dinner, one of the many company restaurants still standing since the eighties. She parked her scooter in the crowded lot, despite it still being early. She looked toward the entrance and saw a crowd of people, mostly children, entering the massive building alongside their parents, wide smiles painted on their faces.

—What could be so special about this place?— Emilly wondered as she stepped inside the restaurant. Upon entering, she noticed a large reception area where a familiar old face stood behind the counter. Wearing the restaurant’s caricatured security uniform was Mike Schmidt, an old high school friend Emilly hadn’t seen in years.

—Mikey? Is that you?— Emilly asked.

—Emilly? Wow, what a surprise! It’s been ages since high school. How are you? Are you still in photojournalism and working as a freelance reporter?— Mike said, surprised to see her, despite his tired face, seemingly trying his hardest to stay awake while on the job.

—Yes, I am. I got an offer to work on a documentary and some reporting here, and I’m heading now to meet the owner himself. By the way, do you know where Mr. Afton might be?— Emilly asked.

Mike looked at Emilly with a weary expression and pointed in a direction.

—Ah, my boss… well, his office is backstage. I’ll ask Ness to help you since… I’m way too busy— Mike said.

—That won’t be necessary, Mike. I’m already here— said a voice. Suddenly, a man with a friendly appearance appeared, wearing glasses and a yellow bunny pin, accompanied by a young woman with pink and purple streaked hair tied in a ponytail, dressed in a security uniform like Mike.

—Ah, Vanessa, you brought your dad. I was just about to ask you to help Emilly find him— Mike said, returning to his work.

Vanessa nodded slightly, a faint smile on her lips, while William adjusted his glasses.

—Miss Emilly, it is a pleasure to finally meet you in person. I hope your trip here was pleasant— he said, extending his hand.

—It was fine, Mr. Afton— Emilly replied, shaking his hand while trying to mask the immense discomfort and fear growing inside her.

—Well, we have much to discuss, don’t we? Let’s go to my office, away from the noise— he said, gesturing for Emilly to follow him.
Emilly nodded and followed.

They passed through internal corridors where the sound of children laughing and cheerful music gradually gave way to a strange silence, broken only by the distant hum of machinery and the soft creak of the old floor. The walls were adorned with vintage Fazbear Entertainment posters—smiling mascots with unnaturally large eyes frozen in artificial poses.

For a brief moment, Emilly had the unsettling sensation that those eyes were following her.
William stopped in front of a wooden door and opened it.

—Please, make yourself comfortable. I believe this conversation will be very productive— he said with a polite smile.

Freddy's Family Dinner, Management Office
Friday, March 15, 2024
8:10 a.m.

The room was silent. Emilly sat in a chair, facing William, who was sipping a bit of coffee.

—Well, I suppose you’ve seen the email I sent you, haven’t you?— the man asked.

—Yes, I saw it a few days ago, but tell me, Mr. Afton… why would such a large and famous company like yours want a documentary and promotion produced by a small company like mine?— Emilly asked.

William let out a soft laugh and turned his gaze toward the window, observing the distant activity of the restaurant.
—To be honest with you, my young lady, I don’t trust these big media companies. They always find a way to twist everything involving Fazbear Entertainment, and it’s extremely difficult to disprove those lies once they spread. That’s why I’m looking for someone fair, competent… and with true journalistic talent. Someone like you— William replied.

Emilly took a deep breath.

—I see. So what exactly do you expect from me? A documentary? A promotional video? Or something beyond that?— Emilly asked.

William smiled. He then opened one of the drawers of his desk and pulled out a yellow envelope, which he carefully placed in front of her.

—Here is everything you need to know. I want a full documentary and a promotional video. In this document, I’ve listed the areas of the restaurant you may film and photograph… oh, and I also included the payment amount and the period you may stay with the company— the man said.

Emilly looked at the document and was quite surprised to see an incredibly high sum of money—enough to buy a larger studio, a team of professionals, and high-quality equipment. On top of that, the time frame was ten months. An offer impossible to refuse.

—So, Mrs. Campbell, do you accept the job?— William asked, extending his hand.

—You can count on me, Mr. Afton. I’ll give my best to create the documentary and promotional video— Emilly said, shaking his hand. William’s expression showed satisfaction at her response.

—Then welcome to our family. You’ll begin your work tomorrow night, as it’s the only time the restaurant isn’t busy— William said.
Emilly nodded, gathering the documents and standing up from the chair.

As she left the office, she had the strange sensation that the moment the door closed behind her, an unusual chill began to creep over her.
William Afton remained seated, watching the
closed door, his coffee slowly cooling on the table.

A subtle smile formed on his lips.

—Oh… this is going to be very fun— the man murmured.

Life has been a bit repetitive lately, pretty stagnant. I'm looking to change that! I’ve been in Germany for a while, but being naturally introverted, the process of ""getting out there"" hasn't always been easy. I’m stepping out of my comfort zone to try something new and hopefully find some genuine connections.

I’m looking for people who might share a few of my passions, or even someone who can introduce me to something entirely different.

I love music. My taste is pretty eclectic, but I lean heavily into Rock (from classic to indie) and Hip Hop. I love discussing discographies, sharing new finds, or even hitting up a local gig or dive bar with a good playlist.

I’m a massive UFC fan. If you’re down to stay up late (or watch the replays) to discuss fight cards, etc., we’ll definitely get along. Moreover, I enjoy playing Badminton, and making music as well. I am currently learning Guitar.

I enjoy big-picture conversations. Whether it’s ethics, existentialism, or just deconstructing how the world works, I’m always up for a coffee-shop debate that goes beyond small talk. I am also all for humor. I like people who don't take themselves too seriously.

I’m looking for more than just ""activity partners"", I’m hoping to build real friendships. Whether it’s grabbing a coffee, exploring the food scene, or just having a low-key afternoon of gaming or talking, I’m open to it. As an immigrant, I also appreciate the unique perspective of navigating life in a new country, so whether you’re a local or a fellow expat, I’d love to hear your story. If any of this resonates with you, feel free to drop a comment or send me a DM! Also, I can speak a bit of German (I understand it completely).

Sis in laws daughter drank from my coffee while actively throwing up.,"For context my sis in law had an appointment with her newborn so she had asked if she can drop off her two toddlers (4f, 3f) to make it easier and her brother (my husband) and I said yes of course. We have two daughters (2f, 5mo f) and our oldest loves her cousins.

Well less than 30 mins after the girls get dropped off the oldest (4f) starts throwing up. We think it’s odd and just give her water. She ends up throwing up again. All while touching all our daughters toys, and blowing in my daughters face for some reason? Just .. blowing in her face.. kids lol..

so I text my sis in law and tell her that my niece is throwing up and she casually texts back ""oh yeah she ate late and was throwing up all night"" (yet told me nothing). ""It’s just the food that sat bad with her"". But.. it’s the next day? At 12pm at this point? I’m pretty sure it’s a bug. I have a toddler, newborn, and two older sons (11m, 9m) so I know what bugs look like and the time frame. How they work. I don’t like confrontation or problems so I just tell my husband let’s just distance our oldest and the baby and keep them in different sides of the house. She ended up throwing up again and I’m convinced that she’s sick. But whatever I made my breakfast and I was drinking some coffee and set on the table, went to the kitchen quick and came back to her drinking my coffee!! 😭 lowkey I got mad at her and told her not to drink my coffee and she cried. It was from Dunkin so whatever I just threw it away and she cried more lol but idk honestly I’m kind of bothered and annoyed. When SIL got back I told her if next time she could keep the girls home if they’re throwing up. She got mad at me and said she’s not sick and that I’m being dramatic. AIO?

1qqf4v4,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qqf4v4/war_for_the_kingdom_of_the_mole_men/,War For The Kingdom Of The Mole Men,"The Kit was gone.

It had been entrusted to James, and he had taken it. Inside the Kit was 10,000 dollars.  And pills. That was why he had taken it, E was sure of it. But there was more in the Kit. There were letters. And pictures of ‘cilla.

Red get the boys and fan out, James took the Kit. There’s a car missing. The Lincoln.  He’ll be headed for the airport.

Red spoke into a phone on the wall, then hung it up.

The boys are in town, I’ll get ‘em E, we’ll meet you there.

I’ll meet you at the airport Red.

Beside the door a string of keys. Red grabbed the nearest set, the ones with dice on. them. The door slammed after him.  Slapping leather on concrete then the fire of combustion, cold gasoline vaporized inside eight cylinders and the squeal of tires.

Big E donned a cape. A revolver, a police special, rested in a specially sewed pocket of

his jumpsuit.

His sunglasses darkened the mid July sun of Tennessee. He had chosen the keys to a Cadillac, and the ignition turned. The transmission in gear the pedal on the floor. Loose gravel danced behind him, kicked into a window of the house, a mohawk of rock and dirt and anger

and dinosaur bones.

It would take time for Red to get to town, and the boys. He knew a back road, a ring road around town. Bootlegger route from Prohibition. 

James would go that way.

The hardball highway under his wheels. He flashed his lights, and waved a federal badge at cars ahead of him and they pulled over. Several miles ahead a dirt road to the right.

He took it, fishtailing the Cadillac, turned into the skid, gunned the motor.

The road climbed a gentle hill, broadleaf hardwoods swayed in the wake of American horsepower. Ahead the road turkey tracked, a sharp turn to the left and a gentle grade to the right. The center, a two track path, kudzu crushed by recent tire tracks. He stopped the car.  The tire tracks matched the tread pattern of the Lincoln. 

He pursued.

The suspension rocked and the low slung frame of the Cadillac dragged against baked puddle edges and his speed was reduced by necessity, drag marks ahead were fresh. His confidence grew with his rage.

Another mile and glint in the forest, then a clearing. An ancient farmhouse. 

Overgrown by kudzu and broken vehicles and barrels and gutted furniture and rusted tools. 

Beside the house, the Lincoln.

He pulled behind it, parking to box in and deny escape. 

Revolver in hand he ripped from the drivers seat.

James! James! Get over here!

There was no sound but the clicking of the hot engine.

He scanned, no movement. He kicked open the farmhouse door. 

Pack rats and possums had left their smell and their detritus, but the house held no higher life. His white cowboy boots thud on a molded Persian rug. A hollow sound beneath. He moved the rug. 

A trap door. 

He opened it. A stairwell into darkness.  He examined the stairs.  Fresh prints.

Tony Llamas.

James.

He possessed no external light source, but a cigarette lighter, and he fashioned a torch out of packrat sticks and shredded rags.

James, I’m coming after you man, and if you don’t come out now I’m going to hurt you,

bad.

He descended the stairs. 

Ancient timbers supported the hand hewn tunnel descending

at a 45 degree angle. The stairs were wooden, rotten, some creaked, some were broken in

times past, some broken recently, some broke under his boot. He fed more strips of cloth to the torch. No markings on the wall, save for pick ruts and chisel marks in the harder rock.

The stairs switchbacked and the air grew warm. His sideburns fluttered with a breeze in his face that smelled of pancakes and maple syrup. Far ahead a light glowed, narrow from distance, blue hued. He drew the revolver and approached carefully, not for concern of ambush, but for concern of the fragile stairs.

James! Last warning man. There’s still time to smooth this out!

The blue light ahead darkened, then reappeared.

If this is about the money, you could just ask, man!

The tunnel turned. Mushrooms on the ceiling of a small room. A body in the center. Not James’ somebody else, an ancient body with rotting denim overalls shrouding mushroom cracked bones. Beside the body lay a sword. He examined it. The scabbard was wood, ornate, black and gold etchings. The steel shined blue, and was free of rust.

Karate sword, he knew. 

The curve of the blade and the hardness of the steel, Damascus. 

A dragon etched into the blade.

“Terminus Est,” written on the handle. 

He felt power when he gripped the handle. Hungry power.

A silk strap was affixed to both ends of the scabbard, and he placed it over his shoulder,

moving his cape for ease of access.

Down the tunnel shuffling, a muffled scrape and strained creaks of tested wood.

James! I made it this far, and I’m still willing to forget all this man.

There was no answer.

He fed a strip of the dead man’s overalls to the torch, and waited

The sound stopped several paces away, still shrouded in darkness. He waited, pistol trained at the opening of the tunnel. 

Then a being leapt into the room. Muscles covered by thick fur, adorned with belts of human skulls. The beast stood high, a head or two taller than him, and peered down with a head covered in dirty fur, a snout protruding, two yellowed teeth at the front, each as big as a man’s thumb, it held a crude club, rebar with a cinder block on the

end.

E stood still, not from fear, he was Army trained, and an accomplished Karateman. It was the oddity of the thing before him. A creature not of this world, from before the time God banished Behemoth and Leviathan. A remanent of a past world full of sin and evil and

savagery. The giant creature readied its improvised club, and he shot it with the police special.

Two rounds of .357 tore through the chest of the creature, ripped coffee can sized holes through

the back. The creature stumbled, then fell backwards. 

He examined the body. The fur was fine, thick, like that on a dog’s face. There were eyes, but they were mere slits, tiny ears sat upon the thing’s head. The snout was also like a dog’s, extended several inches, the two large front teeth gave way to rows of small ones, separated by a rough gray tongue.

The body was like that of a man’s. But the claws. Five on each finger, six inches or

longer. 

He touched one, it was hard, chipped, caked in dirt. He counted the skulls around the thing’s waist, seven, some large, but two were small, children’s size.

Mole men, just like in the movies, Lord Jesus.

He calculated his options. He had four rounds left in the revolver, and he knew his torch wouldn’t last the ascent. He would be trapped if he stayed in this place or continued. 

But James had the Kit. And he needed it back.

He gathered what was left of the tattered overalls, added them to the torch, and walked the tunnel of the beast’s origin.

More wooden steps. Five of them. Then nothing.

He stepped into air and fell, tumbling through warm darkness. 

He fell faster than the torch and its light danced into his view every few seconds as he spun head over boots in the darkness. Then the torch unraveled and there was no light. Only wind and blackness. 

He began to panic, but summoned an inner calm. He reached one corner of his rhinestone cape, and then another, and held it out like a wing. The increased drag stabilized his fall, Army training took over, and positioned his feet below him like a paratrooper.

He glided untold minutes. Meditation controlled his mind, and the fear of the darkness was pushed down, replaced with a calm readiness. 

More untold minutes and a glow appeared below him. Orange and yellow and warm.

He glided toward the light. A cloudbank, or fog, he wasn’t sure. His cowboy boots pierced the cloudbank and he was buffeted by turbulence, condensation on his sideburns and eyebrows. 

More descent. And the light grew brighter.

Soon he was through the cloud bank. Below him a vast and green landscape. A box canyon covered in clouds, dazzlingly bright mushrooms lining the sides. Foliage below, and a massive tower, cobblestone square. Houses.

Holy moley, I found the center of the Earth, man.

The updrafts were strong, and harnessed them to slow him and to gently land. He did so, in the square.

He was in a village. The stone tower stood 300 feet tall, a stone snake constricted its way around the vertical length of it over and over from the bottom to the top. 

Huts of mud and thatched roofs surrounded the square, some larger buildings were made of stone and unknown timber, and large white material.

Bone. Behemoth’s bones built these buildings.

WHO DARE ENTER MY KINGDOM?

A voice from everywhere echoed in his ears. The sound shook his teeth and vibrated his sideburns.

He looked around. There was no one speaking. Inside the nearest hut he saw something peak out at him. A creature, small, timid looking.

I SAID WHO DARE ENTER!? FLYING SKY MAN! SPEAK! I AM THE WIZARD BRANCH HEMLOCK, HEWER OF TREES AND MEN, SLAYER OF THE THE CRIMINAL GADIANTON, CAMBRIAN OF THE EARTH, AND KING OF THIS REALM AND I DEMAND YOU SPEAK OR SUFFER YOUR VERY DEATH!

Whoa man, I’m a bit of a King myself.

YOU DARE TO CHALLENGE MY POWER!?

From the top of the tower, a man jumped and fell at fast speed toward him. 

The man landed gently 20 or so paces from him, he felt the breeze of his wake buffet him.  The man was old, long hair, a white beard past his chest. Black adorned robe covered a skinny frame, a tall pointy hat similarly adorned with moons and stars atop his head. He carried a sword and spoke in a rasp. 

A wizard. A wizard king.

A king? A king has come to challenge me for my kingdom? I see.

No business here but my own. I came looking for my man, he took something from me,

and I’m going to take it back.

The wizard king squinted, then turned and spoke words unpronounceable in a human

mouth. A dozen mole men emerged from the stone building, all crisscrossed with human skulls and other grisly accouterments. 

They drug a mangled body behind them.

James.

So, So Called King, is this your man?

My man was alive when he fled, and though he did me wrong, he’s still my own. I had no quarrel with you man, but now I do.

SO BE IT!

The mole men dropped James’ body and charged. He knew the revolver was of no use, so he left it in his jumpsuit. The karate sword unsheathed, he drew a defensive combat stance.

The creatures balked their charge.

WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

I found it, man.

BLASPHEMY!

The wizard king stepped into the sky, non-Euclidean geometries of lights dancing from his fingers, arcing toward him, fire and death and heat and hate and off key music followed. 

He executed a karate roll and missed the first salvo, then another. A third struck close, and a fourth was a direct hit, but the light and the heat was absorbed into the sword. 

He felt a power surge through him, transmitted from the wizard king  to the light to the sword to him. 

He took a step and felt the ground soften. He looked down and he was floating. He took another step and gained elevation.

Below him, hundreds more mole men emerged from huts and buildings and nearby forests and fields, and sank to one knee as they watched the duel of kings.

The wizard flung more light and fireballs at him, and he absorbed them with the blade, power surging through him.

IT CAN’T BE! NOT LIKE THIS!

He closed to within a dozen paces of the man in the sky, drew the police special, and fired four rounds into the wizard king’s head. The man fell to the ground, dead.

He descended to the corpse, and touched the blade to the man’s body. Unimaginable power gripped him as the blade drew the magic. Memories that were not his flooded his mind, and knowledge of 10,000 years of forgotten secrets.

He stepped into the sky, sword held above him. The molemen fell to both knees and let out an unworldly sound. 

A sound of rejoice.

You’re free now baby, all of you. But if you stick with me, we got a lotta business to take

So, I lower my guard and just take a zip of my coffee and relax. I don’t care because there is nothing here that gets my attention. It’s just a gray mass of anonymous bodies. Almost as if they are a part of the furniture here, blending in with the walls. 

Probably, in this crowd, there is a fair amount of very interesting people. Intelligent, caring, funny and with various life stores to share. But I don’t care. No one attracts me. Sexually, that is. 

Suddenly, a tall young guy arrives. He is probably in his late twenties. Pretty much a twink. Gorgeous face. My adrenaline level raises. I can feel my heartbeat increase. I’m feeling vulnerable. 

I want to be seen by him. And as quickly as possible, before he finds someone else to start talking to. So the clock starts ticking. What can I do to get his attention? Of course, I’m invisible to him. I am as much a part of the furniture here as all the other guys I observed. 

I’m feeling helpless. Invisible. Ugly. Old. Almost humiliated, even though I have made no attempt to approach him. If only he could put his eyes on me for a fraction of a second. But no. Trying cold calling on him would lead to disaster. Humiliation.

I'm trying to put together some kind of a design for an outdoor seating area for a grocery/coffee store. Everything for the shop is contained inside, but I have a space, approx 60ft x 9ft to work with to make a nice seated area. I can't get away from using containers purely because 1. I need a solid back wall for the area to hide what's behind it and 2. at 9ft wide its asking to drop a shipping container. 

The width of a container thought doesn't lend itself well to maximising seating space while also being able to push a pram down it.

Has anyone come across anything for inspiration? I'm at my early days yet but everything I can find online is more to do with putting a coffee shop in the container, not the actual seating area.

1qqf1yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoryTimeLanguage/comments/1qqf1yj/the_third_language_problem_why_your_brain_starts/,The Third Language Problem: Why Your Brain Starts Mixing Everything Up,"I've been focusing on Spanish for the last two years. The other day I ran into a Japanese person, and I was pretty confident in my Japanese--about 15 years ago.

What came out of my mouth was the most hilarious combination of Japanese and Spanish I've ever heard. Mid-sentence code-switching that made zero sense in either language. It was humbling, it was funny, and it made me realize it might be time to dust off the Japanese again.

Here's the weird part: Japanese and Spanish are linguistically distant, but for me they can feel phonetically close in certain ways--similar vowels, overlapping sounds. I've noticed my brain sometimes pauses mid-word to figure out which language it's supposed to be interpreting. The wires cross in unexpected places.

It got me thinking about what's actually happening in our brains when we juggle multiple languages.

You've spent years getting comfortable in one language. You can hold conversations, read books, maybe even think in it sometimes. Then another language enters the picture--and suddenly everything falls apart.

You open your mouth to speak Spanish and French comes out. You're writing in German and English word order sneaks in. Your accent in Language 2 starts drifting toward Language 3. Your brain, which seemed to have everything neatly organized, has become a linguistic blender.

Welcome to the third language problem. And if you're experiencing it, you're not broken--you're normal.

# Why Your Second Language Intrudes More Than Your Native Language

Here's something that surprises most people: when you're learning a third language, interference from your *second* language often feels stronger than from your native tongue.

This seems backwards. You've spoken your native language your entire life. Shouldn't it be the dominant intruder?

One common explanation is that your brain categorizes languages differently. Your native language sits in a protected category--it's the default, the foundation. But your second and third languages can get lumped together as ""foreign"" languages.

When you reach for a word in your new language and can't find it, your brain doesn't raid the native language vault. It raids the other foreign language shelf--because that's where it learned to look for ""non-native"" words.

This is why Spanish learners who know French keep accidentally saying ""mais"" instead of ""pero."" Why German learners with English as an L2 produce sentences with English syntax. The languages you *learned* interfere with each other more than the one you *acquired* as a child.

# The Four Types of Language Mixing

Not all mixing is the same. Understanding what's happening helps you address it:

**1. Vocabulary Blending** The most common issue. You reach for a word, and the wrong language delivers it. Mid-sentence, you say ""aber"" when you meant ""but"" or ""pero."" This happens most with:

* High-frequency words (conjunctions, common verbs)
* Words that sound similar across languages (cognates and false friends)
* Emotional or spontaneous speech when you don't have time to filter

**2. Grammar Transfer** You apply the rules of one language to another. English speakers put adjectives before nouns in Spanish (""the red house"" becomes ""la roja casa"" instead of ""la casa roja""). French learners use avoir (to have) constructions in German where sein (to be) is required.

**3. Accent Drift** Your pronunciation in one language starts picking up sounds from another. Your Spanish ""r"" starts sounding French. Your German vowels drift toward English. This often happens unconsciously over weeks or months.

**4. The ""Wrong Language Pops Out"" Phenomenon** The most frustrating one. You intend to speak Language A, you're thinking in Language A, and Language B just... comes out. Especially common when:

* You're tired or stressed
* You're switching contexts rapidly
* The person you're speaking with knows both languages

# Why This Is Actually a Sign of Progress

Before you despair: language mixing is not a sign that you're failing. It's a sign that your brain is actively building multilingual networks.

Monolinguals and early bilinguals don't experience this because their language systems developed separately. But adult language learners are essentially renovating the house while living in it. Your brain is creating new neural pathways and sometimes the wiring crosses.

Most learners notice that mixing decreases as L3 strengthens and the brain gets better at managing multiple active systems. It's not permanent chaos. It's a construction phase.

# Strategies for Keeping Languages Separate

The goal isn't to prevent all mixing--that's impossible and probably counterproductive. The goal is to minimize interference during active use. Here's what works:

# Time Blocking

Dedicate specific days or time blocks to each language. Monday/Wednesday/Friday for Spanish, Tuesday/Thursday for French. This gives your brain clear context signals and time to ""settle"" into one language mode.

The key is consistency. Your brain learns to associate Monday morning with Spanish the same way it associates your office with work mode.

# Context Anchoring

One tip I've seen recommended: vary where you study each language, and try to think of a physically different place when you speak them.

Associate each language with specific environments, activities, or media:

* Spanish at the coffee shop
* French while cooking
* German during your commute

Physical context is a powerful language cue. Your brain builds location-language associations the same way it builds other environmental memories. Many learners find that being in a country ""locks in"" that language--your brain follows environmental signals. Some even find that just *imagining* themselves in a specific place helps activate the right language.

# Visual/Color Coding

Use different colored notebooks, apps, or highlighting for each language. It sounds simple, but visual differentiation helps your brain categorize. Blue is German. Green is Spanish. The color becomes a pre-activation cue.

# The Language Warm-Up Routine

Before switching languages, spend 2-3 minutes ""warming up."" Listen to a short clip, read a paragraph, or talk to yourself. This primes the correct language system and suppresses the others.

Think of it like stretching before exercise. You're telling your brain: ""We're about to use *this* system now.""

# Laddering (Using L2 to Learn L3)

Instead of always going through your native language, try learning your new language *through* your second language. Spanish-to-French flashcards. German explanations of Italian grammar.

This creates separate pathways and reduces native language interference. It also reinforces your L2 while building L3.

# The ""One Language Only"" Rule

When possible, make certain contexts strictly monolingual. If you're in Spanish mode, everything is Spanish--even if you need to describe something you don't know the word for. No switching. Describe around it, use gestures, look it up--but stay in-language.

This trains the suppression system. Your brain learns that switching isn't an option in certain contexts.

# The Mixing That's Actually Helpful

Not all cross-linguistic influence is bad. Some mixing accelerates learning:

**Cognate Recognition**: Knowing French helps you recognize Spanish vocabulary. Knowing German helps with Dutch. Your brain's tendency to connect related languages speeds up comprehension.

**Metalinguistic Awareness**: By your third language, you understand *how* languages work. You notice patterns faster. You're not just learning Spanish--you're applying everything you learned about language acquisition from French.

**Transfer of Skills**: Reading strategies, listening techniques, vocabulary learning methods--these transfer. You're not starting from zero. You're leveraging experience.

The goal is to encourage helpful transfer (skills, patterns, cognates) while minimizing unhelpful interference (wrong words, wrong grammar, wrong accent).

# What to Expect

The mixing is usually worst early on, when the new language is strong enough to be active but not strong enough to stand on its own.

It gets better. Your brain builds better separation with time and practice. Many learners report that by their fourth or fifth language, they have stronger control systems--the mixing decreases with each new language.

In the meantime, don't punish yourself for errors. Notice them, correct them, move on. The mixing isn't failure--it's your brain doing the hard work of becoming multilingual.

Over the past few years, I have been deeply researching (drinking mainly) ceremonial-grade Japanese matcha — not for business at first, but for wellness and daily rituals. I’ve ended up learning a surprising amount myself.

What stood out to me most is how high-quality ceremonial matcha produces a calm, sustained focus rather than a spike-and-crash. The combination of L-theanine and caffeine, especially in first-harvest leaves, genuinely feels different from coffee.

Another big difference is terroir. Matcha from southern regions like Kagoshima tends to be smoother, less bitter, and more comforting — which explains why many beginners struggle with harsh matcha sourced elsewhere.

I’m curious, for those of you who drink matcha regularly, what made the biggest difference for you? Grade, origin, preparation method, or something else?",0,1769707765.0,greentea,0,0.5,False

Things were really confusing at the time, even a year later I'm not sure what the f\*\*\* happened. But this is not the post about the whole ordeal but about the aftermath.

To say I was completely shattered was an understatement. But luckily I had an amazing network of people (friends, family, coworkers,...) who had my back. And who had my back the most? Michael's family. While he disappeared to chase some fairly tale, hid and escaped responsibility, his sister moved me to their place, gave me roof above my head, gave me food and asked for nothing in return. They were absolutely amazing, tried to help me with everything they could and made sure I felt loved and like at home. When the day of the birth came, his sister drove me to the hospital and stayed with me during birth because Michael couldn't be bothered or was in denial or something, I'm not sure. 

So what happened to my wayward spouse next? After he went nuclear with our relationship, he gradually cut almost everyone from his ""old"" life off. Why? No one knows, probably because he didn't like people disagreeing with his decisions or because he is ashamed. His friends who knew him for 15+ years (who became my friends as well) and who he met every week for coffee or beer before haven't seen him for months. And when they do, they are kind of disgusted, because he either pretends nothing happened and he did nothing wrong or he drunkenly spirals into self-pity, complaining how difficult his life is and how everyone mistreats him, yada yada. Beside that, his relationship with his family grew cold, distant and is limited to formal visits once or twice a year. So if he ever reaches the rock bottom for any reason, he has no one to go to. 

He might be with the AP still but at least at the start things seemed on and off style - seems like the AP wanted to win a married man but didn't want a serious relationship because when he ended things with me, she rejected him (and rumor has it she had sex with some other coworkers...). He became quite depressed, started drinking, smoking, lost a lot of weight. But likely he was relentless in his pursuit, so it seems like they got together after all and he very quickly moved to her place. Not sure about that though, it's just rumors.

And what about me? Michael's sisters' family, his mother and I had a good relations even before but this really made us bonded. To this day, more than a year later, we live close to each other, visit each other frequently, have dinners together, go on family trips together and help each other out with kids - like a family. All while laughing and joking all the time and having a great time. They told me they absolutely do not understand why would Michael pick anyone else over me, that they love me and want me to keep being a part of their family. They even said they feel like I'm more their family than Michael is and can never look at him the same way. And that if they really become legit, the AP won't be welcome in their home.  
  
I haven't met the AP and all I know about her are just rumors but if any of that is true she seem like a walking drama and mental issues or sex addiction. For instance, one person who briefly knows her told me she was always known for sleeping around, seducing guys and that she intentionally undresses in front of guys at work, presumably also showering them with admiration and attention. His friends also told me they have a feeling like she uses him and keeps him around because she hasn't found a new target yet but at the same time it seems like she is pushing hard for divorce (which I wanted anyways but he procrastinated) and I think she looked me up on social media. And if she really does have such a high drive, I'd love to see what she does when she finds out Michael gradually loses interest in sex when novelty fades (did with me and all his exes as far as I know), lol.

‘You look like you’ve lost weight but too much’

‘Are you eating?’  Do you need food?

‘Are you sick’

And honestly, most of the ""easy money"" stuff is either a scam or takes way too much effort for pennies.



But I wanted to share something I actually found useful for those little bits of downtime throughout the day. I stumbled upon this app called AttaPoll a few months ago. At first, I was super skeptical, because, let's be real, most survey apps are terrible. They either disqualify you constantly, have super long surveys for tiny payouts, or just never pay out.



AttaPoll isn't going to make you rich – let's get that out of the way right now. But what I really like about it is how \*consistent\* it is, and how many \*short\* surveys pop up. I'm talking surveys that take 2-5 minutes and pay anywhere from $0.20 to $0.80. It's perfect for when I'm waiting in line at the supermarket, on my commute, or just chilling on the couch for a few minutes. Instead of scrolling through social media aimlessly, I can knock out a couple of quick surveys.



The payouts are instant to PayPal, which is a huge plus. I usually let it accumulate to around $10-15 and then withdraw. It's not life-changing money, but it adds up for things like a few extra coffees, a takeout meal, or topping up my fuel tank. It genuinely feels like found money because I'm just using time I'd otherwise waste.



If you're looking for something genuinely low-effort to grab a few extra bucks here and there, I'd recommend checking it out. You can sign up using my referral link here, and we both get a small bonus when you complete your first survey: [https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql](https://attapoll.app/join/vtfql)

You want something that screams *""This is so us!""* — a gift that captures your unique bond, inside jokes, and shared memories. That’s where personalized figurines come in. These custom 3D figures are more than just cute keepsakes; they’re hilarious, heartwarming, and honestly, unforgettable.

Think about it: your best friend opening a tiny version of themselves, frozen in a moment that only the two of you truly understand. Maybe it's them in their go-to outfit, holding a coffee cup like the caffeine addict they proudly are. Or maybe it’s both of you side by side, recreating a photo from that one epic trip or night out. The possibilities? Endless.

What makes these custom figures so special is the ability to bring humor and sentiment together in one physical piece. Want to make your bestie laugh? Design their figurine with an exaggerated pose or include that silly thing they always do with their hands. Want something sweeter? Capture a soft smile, their favorite book, or even a small pet figure next to them. These figures reflect not just how your friend looks — but who they are.

A **personalized figurine** turns your memories into something you can hold. It’s the kind of gift that says, “I know you, I see you, and I appreciate every weird, wonderful part of you.” And whether your best friend is goofy, sentimental, dramatic, or a mix of everything — you can reflect that in the design. You get to choose the details, from head to toe, making each piece totally unique.

Let’s not forget, these make awesome conversation starters too. Whether displayed on a desk, a shelf, or next to a growing collection of shared treasures, they always bring back that ""remember when"" feeling.

So, if you’re tired of buying the same friendship bracelets, candles, or mugs, shake it up this year. Go for something bold, meaningful, and a little silly. Go for a custom figurine that’s as iconic as your friendship.",1,1769706953.0,PrefectContent,0,1.0,False

Just wanted to share something I've been using that's actually been pretty decent for grabbing some quick cash. I know a lot of us are looking for those extra dollars, and while this isn't going to make you rich, AttaPoll has been surprisingly good for making a few bucks here and there.



I usually just open the app when I have some downtime – waiting in line, on a boring commute, or just chilling on the couch. It's basically short surveys. Most surveys are pretty quick, like 5-15 minutes, and pay anywhere from $0.50 to $2.00. I've been able to pull out $20-$30 a week sometimes just by casually doing surveys. It adds up faster than you'd think, especially when you just need a little extra for coffee or a small bill.



It's super low-effort, and they pay out quickly to PayPal or gift cards. Just wanted to share in case anyone else needs a quick, no-brainer way to snag some small, immediate cash.

I’m pretty convinced you’ve moved, or we were really just never meant to see each other again. But the part that I don’t understand is why I ended up here. Was it proof that I could never have you anyway? I mean, I lived around the corner from her all those years and bumped into her once in twenty years. I could probably live here another twenty and never see you.

It’s nice being able to talk to you. It feels like we know each other. It always did. Well, I hope wherever and whatever you’re doing, you’re happy today.

I was really hurting yesterday. I missed the family I never had. I cried a lot. I thought about you walking past the window. I realised I’d never want you to see that version of me. I’d never want you to actually get to know me, the real me. Not out of shame, well maybe it’s partly that. But really, I just think you’re too pure.

Your happiness was too pure, and whenever you smiled at me I felt like you were almost innocent. Not like you were perfect, but like you hadn’t seen the depths of hell on earth. That you hadn’t looked the devil in the eye. Imagine if I told you. If you held my hand and I told you the things I’d seen, the things that happened to me. Would you look at me the same, with those happy eyes? Eyes full of life.

That’s why I cried that day. I saw in you what I never got to. I saw the version of me that would have existed, that should have but didn’t. You held me like I meant something, like my existing was enough. Like you didn’t want or need anything.

But I couldn’t take from you. You deserve better than me. You deserve someone happy, someone normal, someone ordinary, someone pretty inside and out. Inside of me is so ugly. You saw the outside, the outside I don’t get to see. So when you smiled, I saw it from the inside looking out. I saw it through the darkness and ugliness of life. You saw me in the light.

And I know you held me in hopes I’d feel it, that somehow, if you held me still enough, I’d feel the warmth. But I’m so cold, darling. I can’t run from it, and I can’t fix it.

I’m sat here waiting for it to end. Or hoping God will let me feel a little warmth again. That if you came into my life, then maybe God does love me. All this time, I never asked why. I never accused them of cruelty. I only ever wondered why God allowed it, why God gave me life just to make me suffer.

1qqegq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1qqegq8/no_second_baby_no_you_only_divorce/,"No Second Baby, No You, Only Divorce","Chapter 1 The Moment Heart Breaks





Scarlett Theron pulled into Oakland Villa around ten that night. It was the fifteenth—her ovulation day, a date she'd marked on her calendar weeks ago.



Scarlett already had a daughter, but her husband's parents, Amanda and Richard Stewart, had been gently urging her to have a second child ever since. 



In most other families, she might have playfully joked about their eagerness—half-teasing whether they had some special legacy to look forward to. But the Stewarts? As Rivergate's wealthiest family, with a multi-billion-dollar fortune, everyone knew they hoped to welcome another male heir into the family, someone who could eventually be part of carrying on their family's legacy.



When she walked into the bedroom, her husband Vincent Stewart was already in bed, waiting. 



He didn't say a word—no ""hello"", no ""how was your day""—just moved into action like they were checking off a chore. 



Three minutes later, Vincent rolled out of bed and headed for the bathroom to clean up, leaving Scarlett lying there, still in her clothes, feeling more like a tool than a wife.



Vincent emerged a few minutes later, pulling on his shirt with his back to her. ""Keep tracking your cycle,"" he said flatly. ""Call me if the test comes back positive.""



That was how it had been for all five years of their marriage—him, quiet as a stone, cold as winter. 



Their marriage was just a show—something to tell the press and the Stewart elders that everything was ""normal"".



Scarlett knew about Vincent's other woman, of course. She'd scrolled through every one of his social media accounts, dug through old comments, and finally tracked down the profile of the woman who had Vincent's attention. 



Ever since, she'd been secretly following her posts—because that was the only way she could find out where Vincent was, what he was doing, who he was with.



The woman posted constantly—photos of her meals, vacation snaps, birthday parties. 



Before they'd started trying for a second baby, Scarlett barely saw Vincent at all. Now, he showed up once a month—just enough to ""try"" for another baby.



Knowing he was in a hurry to leave, Scarlett scrambled out of bed. ""Can we talk for a minute?"" she called after him.



Vincent turned, his face blank, like he couldn't figure out why she'd want to ""talk"". ""About what?""



Scarlett's voice dropped, almost a plea. ""I want us to be a real couple. You know? Like... have dinner together. Talk. Not just... this.""



She gestured vaguely at the bed, at the empty space between them.



She knew deep down their marriage was falling apart, but she couldn't help clinging to the smallest hope. What if this time, he listened? What if he realized she wasn't just a womb, but the woman who'd loved him for eight years, who'd married him even when her family warned her against it, who'd had his daughter and wanted nothing more than to make their family work? She didn't want her marriage to end in failure.



But Scarlett's words vanished into the air. Maybe Vincent didn't hear her. Maybe he just didn't care. He finished buttoning his shirt, clipped on his watch, and headed for the door.



Scarlett hurried after him, but she didn't beg like she used to—didn't grab his arm and beg him to stay a little longer. This time, when he reached the doorway, she stood her ground.



""Vincent,"" she snapped, her voice breaking, ""you come here once a month. You never call me first. We haven't eaten a meal together in... I don't even remember how long. We're strangers who share a house. Is this really a marriage?""



Vincent paused, finally turning to look at her. He didn't acknowledge her tears, didn't seem to notice the way her hands were shaking. ""Once you're pregnant with another baby,"" he said, ""I'll move back to Oakland Villa."" Then he walked out, the door clicking shut behind him like he hadn't even heard her.



Scarlett stood there, frozen. 



Eight years of loving him, five years of marriage—and she'd given everything. When she had their daughter, Vanessa Stewart, she'd suffered an amniotic embolism. The doctors had told the family three times she might not make it. Even then, she'd been willing to risk her life again for a second child—for a son, just to make him happy.



But now, a cold doubt settled in her chest. Was it worth it? All this pain, all this waiting... for a man who didn't even look at her when she cried?



After her shower, she picked up her phone on autopilot and opened her favorite video app. Her ""frequently watched"" list had only one name—Rina. 



She tapped on the profile—and there it was, a new video posted two minutes ago. It was just a photo of two shadows under a streetlamp, but in the corner, two hands were tangled together, both wearing matching couple bracelets. 



The caption read, ""Two shadows under the light—one's mine, and the other's mine too.""



Scarlett's chest ached, but it was a dull pain now, not the sharp, crushing agony she'd felt the first time she saw a post like this. Maybe she was getting used to it.



Every time Vincent left her, he was rushing to be with someone else. But she told herself as long as he still needed her to have that heir, no one could take her place as Mrs. Stewart. 



She just had to keep swallowing the hurt, keep playing the part.



\*\*\*\*\*



A month later.



At seven o'clock that evening, Scarlett clutched a fresh positive pregnancy test, her hands shaking with excitement as she hurried back to Oakland Villa. She'd been waiting for this—hoping this would be the thing that brought Vincent home, that made him see her.



But as she reached the living room doorway, she heard Amanda talking—and froze.



""Vincent, you're thirty-two,"" Amanda said, her voice sharp. ""Five years of marriage, and you've only got a daughter to show for it. You two 'try' once a month? How's Scarlett supposed to get pregnant that way? If she can't do it, just have that woman you're seeing have the baby. As long as it's a boy—as long as he's a Stewart—I'll accept him.""



Vincent's voice cut in, firm, ""That's not the same, Mom.""



Amanda huffed. ""Why not? A grandson's a grandson!""



Scarlett held her breath, stepping back into the hallway. For a second, she thought he was defending her—defending their marriage. After all, she was his wife. No matter what he did outside, she was the one who'd carried his child, who'd almost died for his family.



Then Vincent spoke again, and her blood turned to ice.



""Mom, do you remember when Scarlett had Vanessa?"" he said, calm like he was talking about the weather. ""She had an amniotic embolism. Having a baby's risky.""



Amanda scoffed, ""Don't give me that! She's a jinx. Other women have five kids without breaking a sweat, but Scarlett? Her first birth had us all over the news for three days—bad luck, that's what she is!""



Vincent didn't argue with the ""jinx"" comment. He just said, ""Scarlett's already been through it once. She can handle the risk. But Sabrina's still young—I can't ask her to go through that.""



Sabrina. The name hit Scarlett like a punch to the gut. She stood there, the pregnancy test crumpled in her hand, tears burning her eyes but not falling. 



She'd known Vincent didn't love her. She'd known he was cheating. She'd even known their marriage was a lie. But she'd clung to one stupid hope—that having another baby would tie him to her, that she'd always be Mrs. Stewart no matter how much Vincent played around outside.



But the truth was worse than she'd ever imagined. To Vincent, she wasn't a wife. She wasn't even a person. She was just a vessel—one that had already proven it could survive the danger of childbirth, so he didn't mind risking her again. Sabrina, though? She was the one he cared about. Sabrina was the one he wouldn't let get hurt.



Scarlett tuned out their conversation, thrown back to Vanessa's birth—waking up weak and raw-throated in the ICU. She thought about the nights she'd spent alone, crying because he didn't call. She thought about the way she'd tracked the mistress' posts, just to feel like she still knew him.



Scarlett'd risked her life for the Stewarts, and they didn't even care if she lived or died.



Clutching the pregnancy test, she realized—it was time to stop. 



Today was supposed to be their monthly ""try"" day, but none of that mattered now. Her heart—what was left of it—had broken in that instant.



There was no point in keeping this baby. If no one else cared about her, she had to care about herself.



Just as she turned to leave, the housekeeper, Freya Miller, rounded the corner. ""Mrs. Stewart? You're back already?""



Scarlett forced a small smile. Maybe today was the day she finally said it out loud. The day she asked for a divorce.





Chapter 2 I Don't Want This Anymore





Scarlett slipped the pregnancy test into her pocket and walked into the living room. The sound of Amanda and Vincent's voices died instantly—like they'd been caught talking about something they didn't want her to hear.



She didn't bother greeting them. Not like she usually did—with a smile, a ""how was your day"", an offer to make coffee. 



For years, she'd tried to be the perfect wife—kind to her in-laws, quiet when they criticized her, always putting Vincent's needs first. She'd thought if she just tried hard enough, he'd notice. He'd care.



But reality had slapped her awake. Even if she gave them her whole heart, the Stewarts would just step on it. Five years of giving and getting nothing in return? That was enough.



Vincent knew clearly he’d come back to take care of their ""monthly business"", and he glanced at her, then nodded at Freya. ""Freya, see my mom to the door.""



Scarlett stood there, silent, but there was a new coldness in her eyes—something Amanda and Vincent had never seen before.



Everyone loved Vincent. He ran the family business like a genius, was polite to his elders, loyal to his friends, fair to his employees. People always said Scarlett'd been lucky to marry him—like she'd won the lottery. But only Scarlett knew the truth—all that kindness, all that charm? It stopped the second he walked through their bedroom door. To her, he was just cold. Distant. A stranger.



And she was done with it.



As Amanda turned to leave, she paused when passing by Scarlett, and then she snapped, ""If you can't give the Stewarts a grandson, how do you plan to face the family ancestors?""



Once, Scarlett would've bowed her head, mumbled an apology, let Amanda's words sting. 



But not now. She turned to look at Amanda, her gaze sharp. ""Amanda, we're both women. You know having a son isn't just my responsibility.""



Amanda's eyes widened in shock. She was used to Scarlett being meek—easy to push around. But this? This was defiance. Amanda didn't back down either—she raised her hand and slapped Scarlett hard across the cheek, the sound echoing in the quiet room. ""Is that how you talk to your elders? Apologize!""



She glared at Scarlett, sure she'd back down. Amanda knew how much Scarlett loved Vincent—knew she'd do anything to keep him, even humiliate herself.



But now, she no longer wanted to swallow her pride and compromise. Since none of them had ever valued her efforts or her life, she refused to comply with anyone anymore.



Scarlett didn't apologize. She didn't even rub her cheek. She just stared at Amanda, her jaw tight, then stepped forward, her hand raised to hit back.



Before she could, though, a strong hand grabbed her wrist—hard. Vincent's voice was low, angry, in her ear. ""Scarlett, are you done acting out?""



She looked up at him. His face was handsome, the same face she'd fallen in love with eight years ago—but now, it just made her sick. The coldness in his eyes fell on her and stung her like a needle. 



How could he be so cruel? 



He didn't love her, he cheated on her, and he treated her coldly—those were already bad enough. But how could someone be so cruel as to treat her like a mere baby-making machine?



What's worse, he even demanded a second child, completely disregarding the risk of amniotic embolism she faced during her first pregnancy. Wasn't that practically trying to kill her?



Just thinking about all this, Scarlett couldn't help but feel a sickening wave of nausea.



She opened her mouth to speak, but Vincent shoved her wrist away. ""I don't have time for this today,"" he said, cold as ever. ""We'll talk about the baby next month."" He took Amanda's arm and started for the door, like Scarlett wasn't even there.



Amanda looked over her shoulder, a smug smile on her face—as if to say, ""See? My son's on my side. You're just an outsider.""



Once, that smile would've made Scarlett cry. Now, it just made her tired. She'd gotten used to Vincent choosing everyone but her.



""Vincent,"" she called out, before he could reach the door. 



She'd made up her mind, and she wasn't backing down. When she'd fallen for him, she'd jumped in with both feet, even when her family told her not to. Now, she was jumping out—for good. Eight years of loving him had drained her. She had nothing left to give.



He saw no value in her and never invested in their marriage. He only wed her out of a sense of obligation when she got pregnant. 



Their union was a grave, but Scarlett was the only one buried there. 



It was long past time for her to see things for what they were.



Vincent stopped, but he didn't turn around. Scarlett thought he was listening to her and took a deep breath, her voice steady. ""I don't want to be married to you anymore. Let's get a divorce.""



Saying it felt like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. 



But then Vincent's phone rang. He answered it, his voice softening—something he never did for her. ""Yeah, I'll be right there,"" he said, then hung up. He didn't even glance at her, just led Amanda out the door, leaving Scarlett standing alone.



Her big ""liberation"" speech? It hadn't meant a thing.



Only when the door shut behind them did Scarlett let out a bitter laugh.



Freya came back a minute later, after seeing them out, and found her standing there, looking distracted. ""Mrs. Stewart?"" she said, gently.



Scarlett shook herself out of her daze and walked to the sofa, sinking into it. ""Freya, can you make me something to eat? I'm starving.""



Once, she'd cooked every meal herself, hoping Vincent would stay for dinner. Even when he only showed up a few times a year, she'd spent hours in the kitchen, making his favorite dishes. But he never cared.



Now, she just wanted to eat—something for herself, not for him. She remembered who she used to be—a girl spoiled by her parents and brother, someone who never had to cook or clean, someone who was loved for just being herself.



After dinner, Scarlett went upstairs to the study and pulled out a sheet of paper. She was going to draft a divorce agreement. 



She didn't need Vincent's money—her family was comfortable, and she was a pediatric surgeon, good at her job. She could give Vanessa a great life on her own. 



But five years of being quiet, of not fighting for herself? That had only gotten her hurt. So this time, she was fighting.



In the agreement, she wrote—Vincent would split half of his post-marriage income with her, and pay two million dollars a month in child support for Vanessa. But then she paused. Vanessa was four years old—who did she want to live with? Scarlett hadn't even asked her.



She folded the unfinished agreement and put it in her bag. She needed to see her daughter.



After Vanessa was born, Vincent had bought a small villa, Ravenshade Villa, for them, away from Oakland Villa. Scarlett had stayed home with her for four years, then gone back to work at the hospital. 



Six months ago, she'd taken a training position at a big hospital in Oakridge—so she'd been even farther from Vanessa. The last two times she'd seen Vincent, she'd been so desperate to fix their marriage that she'd focused all her energy on ""trying"" for a second baby. 



She'd swapped shifts with coworkers, pulled three all-nighters in a row, just to get a few days off to see him.



She'd never stopped to think—if he really cared about having another baby, he could've come to her. But he'd been too busy with Sabrina.



Scarlett hailed a cab to Ravenshade Villa. It was just after nine, and she couldn't wait to hug her daughter. As she got out of the cab, her phone pinged—a notification from the video app. ""Rina, someone you follow, has posted a new video.""



Her heart sank. Even now, even when she'd made up her mind to leave, that woman's posts still found a way to hurt her.





Chapter 3 The Cold Shoulder From Vanessa





Scarlett told herself she didn't want to look—didn't need another knife twist to her chest—but old habits were hard to break. Her thumb tapped the screen before she could stop it.



The video was just a single photo, same as before—Vincent kneeling down in front of Sabrina, his head tilted like he was hanging on her every word. The caption read, ""Had a few drinks, caught a chill, called you up... and you showed up. This right here? This is perfect.""



A sharp, sudden pain lanced through Scarlett's chest. If they were that in love—if they were so desperate to play ""couple""—then fine. Let them have each other. 



She was done fighting to be the ""bigger person"". All she wanted now was a divorce—her daughter, her fair share of the assets, and nothing more to do with the Stewarts.



She stuffed her phone into her pocket and pushed open the front door of the villa. Lily Turner, the nanny, looked up in surprise.



""Mrs. Stewart?"" she said, setting down the dust cloth in her hand.



""Where's Vanessa?"" Scarlett asked, her voice tight with anticipation. It had been weeks since she'd held her daughter—too long, thanks to her training and Vincent's endless excuses.



""Vanessa is upstairs, playing with her Barbie dolls,"" Lily replied.



No sooner had the words left her mouth than Vanessa's voice echoed from the second floor. ""Mom?""



Scarlett's heart ached. She practically ran up the stairs, dropped to her knees, and pulled Vanessa into a tight hug, covering her daughter's cheeks with kisses. 



But when she pulled back, ready to gush about how much she'd missed her, she froze. Vanessa was wiping her face over and over, scrubbing at the spots where Scarlett had kissed her until her skin turned pink.



Scarlett's throat tightened. The questions she'd planned to ask—Did you miss me? How's school?—died on her lips. 



She stared at Vanessa, her eyes stinging, a mix of hurt and confusion swirling in her chest.



Before she could find her voice, Vanessa bounced on her toes, suddenly eager. ""Mom, you're back just in time! I was gonna call you! I'm starting kindergarten soon, and I wanna go to Sunshine Kindergarten."" Her eyes lit up like she'd just talked about a trip to the toy store.



Scarlett frowned, confused—she'd never heard of Sunshine Kindergarten before—but she couldn't bring herself to dampen Vanessa's excitement. It was just kindergarten, after all. If it didn't work out, they could switch later. ""Okay, baby,"" she said, forcing a smile. ""Sunshine Kindergarten it is.""



Vanessa cheered, jumping into the air. ""Thank you, Mom! You're the best!""



Watching Vanessa's grin, Scarlett hesitated. How could she ruin this moment by bringing up divorce? By asking if Vanessa wanted to live with her? 



She reached down, her hand brushing her stomach—still flat, still a secret—and took a deep breath.



""Vanessa,"" she said, her voice soft but serious, ""do you want a little brother or sister?""



Vanessa's excitement faded for a second. She twisted a strand of her hair, then nodded. ""A little brother.""



Scarlett's chest hurt. ""But what if Mom's scared?"" she asked, her voice cracking. The amniotic embolism from Vanessa's birth was years behind her, but the fear—of bleeding out, of leaving her daughter—still woke her up at night.



Vanessa looked at her like she didn't understand. ""Then Mom shouldn't be so selfish,"" she said, matter-of-fact. ""You had me, didn't you?""



It was like a punch to the gut. Scarlett stood there, her face going pale, frozen to the spot. 



She'd spent four years up with Vanessa at 2 a.m., feeding her, rocking her, calming her nightmares. She'd skipped work events to watch her first steps, her first words. And now Vanessa was calling her selfish for being scared to risk her life again?



After a long, terrible silence, she managed to whisper, ""Aren't you scared of losing Mom?""



At this moment, she just wanted to know from Vanessa if there was still any love for her.



Vanessa rolled her eyes, already turning toward her bedroom. ""Ugh, I'm gonna go to bed."" She ran into her room and slammed the door shut.



Scarlett stood at the top of the stairs, feeling like she'd turned to ice. Vanessa—her baby—had just brushed off her fear like it was nothing. Then, through the closed door, she heard Vanessa's voice, bright and excited again.



""Sabrina! I can go to Sunshine Kindergarten now!"" Vanessa gushed, like she was talking to a best friend. ""After work, you can pick me up, so you won't be tired anymore!""



Scarlett's breath caught. Sabrina? Why is Vanessa talking to Sabrina?



""And Sabrina,"" Vanessa continued, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, ""don't have a baby with Dad, okay? Mom said having babies is super dangerous—you bleed a lot and you might die. Let Mom have the little brother. She already had me, so she's not scared.""



A pause, then Vanessa sighed. ""I miss you. I wanna hear your stories and cuddle with you...""



Scarlett leaned against the wall, her legs giving out. So that was why Vanessa wanted Sunshine Kindergarten—because Sabrina worked nearby? That was why she'd brushed off Scarlett's kisses, why she'd called her selfish? Because Sabrina had wormed her way into Vanessa's life, into her heart, while Scarlett was busy working and trying to fix a marriage that was already dead.



She had faced the divorce with one final, unshakable certainty—her daughter would always be hers. The truth—that Vanessa had already sided with the stranger—felt like a betrayal all its own.



All her sacrifices—her time, her love, her near-death experience—had been for nothing. No one cared. Not Vincent, not Amanda, not even her own daughter.



After a while, Scarlett dragged herself downstairs. Lily saw her ashen face and started to ask, ""Mrs. Stewart, are you—""



""Just leave me be,"" Scarlett said, waving her off.



As soon as she stepped outside, she pulled out her phone and called Vincent. It rang four times, then went to voicemail. She called again. And again. 



Normally, she'd give up after two tries—too scared of annoying him—but tonight, she was desperate. She needed to talk to him. She needed to scream.



Finally, Vincent answered, his voice sharp with irritation. ""I'm busy. What do you want—""



""I need to see you,"" Scarlett cut him off, her voice cracking. She was practically yelling, all her composure gone. ""Right now.""



Vincent sighed, annoyed. ""Whatever this is, we can talk next month, when we meet.""



He hung up. The dial tone buzzed in her ear, loud and mocking. Scarlett stared at her phone, tears pricking her eyes, but she couldn't cry. 



This was Vincent—always shutting her out, always making her feel like her feelings didn't matter.



Five years of this. Five years of being ignored, of being a ghost in her own marriage. She was done. 



But she wasn't leaving without a fight—not for custody of Vanessa. Even if Vanessa was closer to Sabrina now, Scarlett had to try. 



She was Vanessa's mother. She'd given birth to her. She wasn't going to let Sabrina take that away.



Just as she made up her mind, headlights flashed. A Rolls-Royce screeched to a stop at the gate. Scarlett looked over—there was Vincent in the driver's seat, and Sabrina in the passenger's, holding a bouquet of pink roses.



Their eyes met through the windshield. Silence hung between them. Once, she would've frozen, scared to make a scene. Now? She didn't care.



Vincent got out of the car, acting like he didn't even see her, and walked around to open Sabrina's door.



""Vincent, we need to talk."" Scarlett called out.



He ignored her, reaching for the door handle. Scarlett rushed over, slapping his hand away. ""Vincent, you can sleep with whoever you want—fine. But Vanessa is my daughter. How dare you let some stranger turn her against me?""



Finally, he looked at her. He was taller than her, and he loomed over her, his voice cold as ice. ""Sabrina's a better mom than you'll ever be.""



As soon as the words left his mouth, Vincent pushed her aside and pulled open the car door.



Scarlett stood there, stunned. It took her a long time to react, and only then did she catch a glimpse of the subtle implication in his words. 



Did he really mean that? Did he want Vanessa to call Sabrina ""Mom""?      





Chapter 4 You're a Terrible Mom





The car door swung open. Vincent held his hand over the roof to shield Sabrina from hitting her head, then offered her his arm. 



Their fingers laced together as she stepped out—and Scarlett had to look away. Once, that small, intimate gesture would've made her cry for hours. Now, she just felt numb.



She was calm, surprisingly so. Maybe it was because she'd finally accepted the truth—this marriage was over, and Vincent had never loved her. All she wanted now was an answer.



""Vincent, what did you mean by that?"" Scarlett asked, her lips trembling. Her voice was shaky, not from fear, but from the anger bubbling just below the surface.



Sabrina stood beside Vincent, her arm still looped through his. Under the moonlight, their shadows stretched across the pavement, merging into one. 



Vincent acted like Scarlett wasn't even there. He started walking toward the villa, pulling Sabrina along with him.



Scarlett had lost count of how many times he'd ignored her like this. Her heart was already broken, but when it came to Vanessa—her daughter—she couldn't back down. 



She found a burst of strength she didn't know she had, ran forward, and grabbed Vincent's wrist.



""Vincent, answer me!"" Scarlett shouted.



He stopped, finally turning to face her. His eyes were cold, no trace of warmth or even recognition. He twisted his wrist, easily yanking it free. ""You're too busy with work,"" he said, like he was explaining something to a child. ""Vanessa's still little—she needs someone to take care of her. When you get pregnant again, Sabrina will look after her.""

I had the absolute best week of my life and I would 100% (and probably will) do it again. There are truly no words to describe how incredibly my experience was but I will try my best below. A piece of my heart will forever be in Tanzania. I did borrow this review format from u/xryuusei because it was so nice - kudos to her for the awesome formatting!!

**Before I get into it, I want to highlight that our luggage was delayed from Amsterdam. When they finally arrived, our Gladys contact transferred everything from our suitcases into our duffels (didn't miss a single thing), and porters hiked them up 6 miles and 4,000 feet of elevation gain to us at our 2nd camp. I also somehow lost a glove between starting the trek and Day 2, and our guide let me borrow his, forgoing gloves on the summit. This just goes to show how incredible they truly are and how much they care about their clients.**

We are a group of 5 women, ages ranging from 31-35, from Utah (we live at 5,000ish feet above sea level), so we already had a slight leg up on altitude acclimatization. All of our vital checks were great - pulse ox never dipped below 85% and heart rates were always below 100 (it didn't really end up mattering in the end though!) All of us have backpacking experience as well. We did a private trek and Gladys lets you depart on whatever date you want for private treks. They are very flexible and we actually ended up picking our trek dates based on flight prices and scheduling.

* I am so glad we chose the Rongai route. I knew that there would be way less people than on the Lemosho or Machame routes, but didn't realize how busy the other routes actually were until we saw them on our way down from the summit. Highly recommend Rongai or Northern Circuit routes if you want to avoid crowds. It is also on the dry side of the mountain so we didn't have rain at all while hiking.
* If we could go back, we would've done 7 days to acclimatize better. While we all trail run or hike multiple times a week, the altitude is no joke and really got to most of us. The hiking itself was totally fine, but the 1 extra day would've helped so much with adjusting.

**Why Gladys Adventures:**

* My criteria: Locally owned, KPAP certified, and a reasonable price.
* I entertained a few other companies, but the inclusion of the toilet tent with Gladys at a more affordable price really won me over. I later found out that a friend had done Rongai 6 with Gladys as well and she only had good things to say, so I knew we were in for a treat.

**Crew (26):** We had a pretty big crew of 26, and when we did intros, each porter announced exactly what they were carrying and if they had any additional responsibilities.

**Breakdown:**

* Head Guide x1
* Assistant Guide x2
* Chef x1
* Porter / Tent Master x1
* Porter / Toilet Tent Attendant x1 - THANK GOODNESS FOR RAPHAEL!!!!
* Porter / Waiter x1
* Porter / Summit Porter x3
* General Porters

**Gear and Renting:**

Oh boy....KLM decided that all 5 of us didn't need our luggage to make it from AMS to JRO, so we actually ended up starting the hike with a bunch of rented gear that we originally had no intention of renting. Thankfully most of us had put our footwear and some other random miscellaneous items in our carry ons, but we all still had to supplement with one thing or another from the gear shop. The gear rental shop definitely had everything you would ever need, but it took a lottttt of digging to find exactly what you wanted, and at the end of the day, it's still not your own gear. No matter, we knew that we would eventually get our bags during the trek, so we weren't too stressed.

**Climbing Highlights:**

* We did a vitals check every morning and evening. Our blood pressure, pulse ox, and heart rate were carefully recorded. We were also asked how our pees & poops (sorry!) were going, and how we were feeling on a scale of 1-10. The guides really want to know how you're actually feeling, so please be honest! Our head guide told us someone tried to hide info from him on a previous trek and ended up having to go down on Day 3 because it finally caught up to him.
* Our porters would meet us about .5 - .25 miles from camp at the end of each trekking day and take our daypacks from us. At first, we all felt this was so unnecessary, but as the days went on, we really welcomed their friendly faces and were so happy to see them.
* All of the porters are employees of Gladys and also go through a gear check to make sure they're using appropriate equipment to summit the mountain. We sadly saw some other porters hiking in Crocs or casual shoes.

**Daily Routine:**

* Wakeup: 7AM
* Breakfast: 7:30AM
* Trekking: 8:15AM-noonish (or whenever we got to camp)
* Lunch: noon-1PM (or whenever we got to camp)
* Free time
* Health check: 6:00PM
* Dinner: 6:30PM
* Bedtime: 8:00PM
* **Day -1 - Airport pick up:** After finding out that our luggage was delayed, we walked out of the airport and found our driver. Gladys specified that they would stay at the airport as long as it takes for you to get out of there unless they find out that you for some reason were not on the plane. It was about an hour ride to the hotel where we promptly crawled into bed and passed out.
* **Day 0 - Prep Day:** We hung out at the hotel all morning, and then at 1:30 our guides came and picked us up to go to the Gladys office. We gathered all the gear we needed from their rental shop, and then did a trek briefing with our 3 guides where they told us in depth what each day would look like. After that, our driver took us all around town to get some souvenirs and learn about tanzanite and then we had dinner at a local restaurant that was DELICIOUS!!
* **Day 1 - Rongai Gate to Simba Camp (2.79 miles, 1,115 feet of elevation gain):** We were picked up at 8AM to go to the Gladys office where we left our suitcase/valuables (we wrote down what valuables we were leaving) and met the porters. They welcomed us with dancing and singing in Swahili - a HUGE highlight of the trip for me. We then had a 3 hour ride to the gate where I attempted to get some sleep. Once we arrived, we had some delicious curry, rice, and vegetables while our guides got the paperwork in order. We were off! The hike was pretty easy and we saw some monkeys! We arrived to camp where we were greeted with everything already set up for us, had tea time, dinner, and then got some rest.
* **Day 2 - Simba Camp to Second Cave (3.99 miles, 2,753 feet of elevation gain):** I woke up at 5AM with the worst stomach pain that quickly evolved into diarrhea (thank goodness for our toilet tent!!!!) I was straight up not having a good time on this hike despite it being relatively easy. The guides poured some powder down my throat that was just labeled ""glucose"" that tasted like Fun Dip Powder. Unclear if it helped but it certainly didn't hurt. Thankfully that eventually passed by noon and I was back to my normal self! We also got our duffel bags on this day which was a huge highlight. Pretty sure our guides were happy they never had to hear us ask about them again.
* **Day 3 - Second Cave to Third Cave (2.53 miles, 1.594 feet of elevation gain):** I was feeling like a million bucks on this day since my stomach was back to normal. It was an easy hike to camp and we made a TikTok with our guides on the way too. Once at camp, we had lunch and our guides tried all of our American snacks which was so much fun. We rested and then went to cooking class! Still in awe of that mountain kitchen.
* **Day 4 - Third Cave to School Hut (2.79 miles, 2,493 feet of elevation gain):** Today marked the highest altitude I'd ever been at. It was a short but steep day and we even had a dance party at 15,000 feet. We had a quick summit gear check where we showed our guides what we were wearing from head to toe, lunch, rest, dinner, rest again, and then we were up at 10PM!
* **Day 5 - Summit Night & Descent (10.25 miles, 3,819 feet of elevation gain):**
   * **What I wore for the summit** (I was super warm, but we had a really good weather day and were super lucky with the temperature/wind)
      * Head: Balaclava, down beanie
      * Top: 2 baselayers (one wool, one fleece), a Patagonia Tech Fleece, a softshell (Arcteryx Atom). About halfway up, I layered on a ski shell. I had a huge synthetic puffy jacket in my pack just in case, but never needed it.
      * Bottom: Wool baselayer, regular leggings, hiking pants. About halfway up, I pulled on down puffy pants. I also had rain pants if needed but never put them on.
      * Feet: Injinji liner socks, Smartwool mountaineering socks (the thickest ones they have), and Oboz Bridger Insulated boots. I probably could have done with toe warmers or another layer of socks, but my feet barely had circulation as is so there was no room.
      * Hands: Fleece lined gloves and ski gloves. Halfway up, I stuck hand warmers in between my gloves that really helped.
   * We woke up at 10PM to put on all of our layers, have a final snack, and hype ourselves up for the challenge ahead. We set off exactly at 11PM at an extremely slow pace. It's better go to super pole pole with few to no breaks than quickly with lots of breaks. The weather was actually pretty great, and I didn't need to have my shell on yet. I was pretty toasty.
   * We had 3 summit porters along with our 3 guides, so that was a ratio of 6:5. They were there to do everything for us (without gloves on mind you) - hold tissues for us to blow our noses, feed us protein bars, hoist us up over rocks, feed us Coke and hot tea, and carry our daypacks.
   * One of the girls in my group had picked up some sort of bug the day before and started throwing up every 5 minutes. I cannot stand the sound of vomiting, so I would cover my ears every time. Just doing that was exhausting! Halfway up, she asked our guides if she could lay down and was met with a stern no (super dangerous!!). She's a trooper though and made it!!
   * Our bladder hoses all froze eventually but our guides had us put our Nalgenes in socks and put them inside our packs so those didn't freeze. Highly recommend doing this and also carrying a thermos so you have warm water!!
   * Gilman's Point: I started bonking right before we hit Gilman's Point - it was probably 6AM by this time and I was STARVING. I choked down a frozen protein bar and some energy chews but those only did so much. BRING SNACKS!!!! I was grumpyyyyyy even though I had no actual altitude related symptoms. I burst into tears at Gilman's because those switchbacks were no joke. Too bad there's no oxygen at 19,000 feet so you can't even cry properly!! This was when I finally gave my daypack to my summit porter because I was feeling so weak.
   * Stella Point: It felt like forever to reach Stella Point but it was really only 15 minutes. My energy was slowly returning and we could see our end goal! This was when we started seeing everyone else from the other routes, and it was cool to all be marching towards the same goal.
   * Uhuru Peak: WE MADE IT!!!!!!! We took a few group pictures and then individual photos in order of who was most unwell to least unwell (me) and spent maybe 5 minutes total at the peak, and then we were headed down to a more appropriate altitude. I had to pee SO BAD so I found some random spot that was not very hidden lol and peeled all 4 layers of pants off so I could pee. Just squatting to go was exhausting.
   * Time to go down! The descent might arguably be harder than the ascent - it's basically just scree so you're scree skiing down a bajillion feet. We kept asking to take breaks but our guides wouldn't let us because they really wanted us to get down in altitude (thankful!!) We stripped off soooo many layers on the way down because the sun was coming out and it was TOASTY. Highly recommend a buff for the descent because I'm pretty sure I still have Kilimanjaro dust in my lungs.
* We took two breaks at each camp on the way down and actually ran into the other Gladys group's camp that had summited the same day we did. It was so awesome feeling like a part of the Gladys family. Our porters met us about 2 miles from Millennium Camp and took our packs from our summit porters and had brought juiceboxes for us. Seeing them was such a highlight of the day.
* We had lunch, passed out for a few hours, then got up and had dinner. Our crew had baked us a cake and brought us sparkling apple cider, which we shared with the porters. They also passed out handmade bracelets for us as a congratulatory gift.

**Day 6 - Millennium Camp to Mweka Gate to Moshi (7.89 miles, 23 feet of elevation gain):** We woke up and had breakfast and then headed down. Not going to lie, it was a slog. But we soaked in the last few hours we had on the mountain and with our guides.

* We took our photos with the Bon Voyage sign, got our certificates, and headed back to Moshi. We had our final meal with our guides and got to visit a local souvenir shop where I finally allowed myself to buy a Kilimanjaro shirt.
* At the Gladys office, we got our luggage, did our tipping ceremony, and said bye to our crew. I cried probably 10 times on this day because I was SO SAD to be saying bye to our mountain family. What a freaking week and experience.

**Observations/Random Thoughts:**

* Diamox: TAKE IT!!!! Even if you don't think you need to, or if you've never been altitude sick, or are worried about peeing 500x, or whatever it is. Obviously, consult a medical professional, but everyone in our group took it and are so glad we did. Altitude sickness doesn't discriminate and will hit you like a truck. I've never had altitude sickness symptoms (the highest I'd been was 15,000 feet) but I still took it.
* Eat enough: As our guide said, this is not the time to be on a diet!!! Our guides rotated sitting with us in the mess tent during meal times to make sure we were eating enough. At first, we assured them that not eating enough wouldn't be an issue, but as we ascended higher and higher, all of us began losing our appetites. We tried to force ourselves to eat though because we knew how important it was. The meal before summit, we had pasta and rice to help us carb load.
* Food: There was PLENTY of food to go around. Most days, we didn't even come close to finishing what they made for us. Each meal had plenty of carbs, protein, and fat. We even got a delicious soup at every lunch and dinner. Very well rounded! It may not be what you're used to or what you love, but it's definitely nutritious. We also had a gluten free person and a vegetarian in our group and they were catered to perfectly.
* Snacks: Going off of the above, I recommend bringing comfort snacks from home. While you definitely will not go hungry because they feed you a LOT, sometimes it's nice just to have something comforting to eat. For me, I was really missing Cheezit, Cheetos, and Sour Patch Kids. Having these would probably have kept me from bonking so hard on summit night.
* Electrolytes: Some people say they didn't need electrolytes, but I don't think our group would have survived without them. We were SO grumpy the first 2 days without them and immediately chugged Liquid IV/LMNT as soon as our duffels made it to camp. Highly highly recommend bringing some if they're a part of your usual wellness/fitness routine.
* Toilet Tent: If you're wondering if this is worth it, IT IS WORTH IT!!!!!! I'm no stranger to backpacking or peeing in the woods but I do not enjoy a stinky hole in the ground, so being able to sit on a toilet made allll the difference.
* Give yourself an extra day or two in Tanzania - maybe do the coffee/cultural tour that many companies offer. This will help with jetlag and also gives your bags time to arrive in the off chance they get delayed.
* We donated our hiking boots, extra socks, water bottles, and other miscellaneous items we aren't ever going to use again to our crew. I also have random gear at home that I definitely would have brought with me had I known that I could donate it. We know that this stuff will all be put to good use.
* We also did a safari with Gladys Adventure and highly recommend that as well. The experience was so seamless since we did it with the same company.

Overall, this was the most amazing week of my life and I am feeling extremely grateful that I was able to have this experience. Gladys is an incredible company that I will recommend over and over again. I've cried multiple times over the past 2 weeks since our trek because I am so overwhelmed with gratitude. To Adam, Patrick, Steve, Raphael, Frank, Alex, Patrick Mountain Mama, Fanuel, and everyone else that made our dreams come true - if y'all are reading this, thank you thank you thank you. Asante sana!!!! See you again someday!",15,1769706545.0,kilimanjaro,4,0.95,False

I also tend to speak faster than I think and talk a lot. Someone once told me that the meaning of existence is a world that experiences itself. I don't fully understand it, but to some extent I resonate with it, ultimately the greatest value a person has as an individual is their own feelings and perceptions, which they release into the world. I'm also big into art.

Among the more important things, I really like birds and rocks, and even more so when the first flowers bloom in spring and the dual nature of being. I'm not fond of plastic, brutalism, and the fact that I waited four years for Silksong only to realise my low level of gaming skills. 

I greatly value, both in myself and in others, initiative, openness to discussions on various topics, having goals and ambitions, and the ability to step outside one's comfort zone.

I'm not very athletic, but I do run and in the summer and I'm learning to rollerblade. :>

I read whatever I can get my hands on, I love Steinbeck and Murakami. I like to read manga or watch anime from time to time. I rarely watch movies although I'm planning to somewhat get to a cinema for ""The Odyssey"" that's coming this year. I also love theatre. :> 

I also tend to speak faster than I think and talk a lot. Someone once told me that the meaning of existence is a world that experiences itself. I don't fully understand it, but to some extent I resonate with it, ultimately the greatest value a person has as an individual is their own feelings and perceptions, which they release into the world. I'm also big into art.

Among the more important things, I really like birds and rocks, and even more so when the first flowers bloom in spring and the dual nature of being. I'm not fond of plastic, brutalism, and the fact that I waited four years for Silksong only to realise my low level of gaming skills. 

I greatly value, both in myself and in others, initiative, openness to discussions on various topics, having goals and ambitions, and the ability to step outside one's comfort zone. 

Bonus if you are eager for some voice call, I just love some good session of chitter-chatter, I also play some games on PC and I have a few co-op's we could try out!

1qqebqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Codependency/comments/1qqebqr/divorce_after_14_years_of_codependence/,Divorce After 14 Years of Co-dependence,"Hi All. I (32M) am being divorced by my wife (32F) of 6 years. We've been together for 14 years - since we were 18 years old. We have two kids together.

She has cluster B personalities traits that she's never sought treatment for. There was slow, tiny, circular progress over the years but she is finally ""splitting"". She asked for a divorce after a ""moment of clarity"" that her marriage was responsible for her unhappiness. Turns out she's having an affair with a 50-year-old man from work (and doesn't know I know).

This has caused me an initially shocking amount of relief, despite all the grief and pain and rage. I am reflecting on the last decade and a half and all the ways I've actually been harmed by this relationship. I was entirely co-dependent. I was primed for it in childhood.

I am rolling with her current clarity and amicability to try to resolve this before she changes her mind.

For years I tried to be her ""knight in shining armor"" - thinking that if I just sacrificed more, minimized myself more, and did more, that she could be happy. That she could like me. Two years ago she told me she needed to see changes and that she was unhappy; I quit drinking, quit 420, quit coffee, quit Diet Coke because she said it was bad for me. I switched therapists because the last one focused too much on my partner and I wanted to work on myself - to make myself better for HER. I spent two years on a grueling journey of self-healing that I didn't even want to go on, but that I took to try to make her happy. And at the end of it all, she still wasn't happy. She says that she does all the trying, that I never tried - after years of peppering me in constant criticism, of me bending over backward to do as she bids. And the ironic, serendipitous, beautiful eucatasrophe of it all is that doing all that for her gave ME the tools, self-respect, self-love, and grounding to survive her departure.

I just wanted to share my experience and maybe commiserate with people who have been through something similar.

thank you for reading, peace and love to you all",7,1769706276.0,Codependency,2,1.0,False

1qqe95f,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qqe95f/why_your_brain_turns_into_a_rage_monster_the/,Why your brain turns into a rage monster: the psychology behind anger (and how to actually fix it),"okay so i watched my friend lose his shit over a coffee shop messing up his order last week. like full on red face, veins popping. over oat milk. and honestly? i've been there. we all have those moments where we snap over something stupid and then feel like garbage after.

here's the thing nobody talks about: if you're constantly going zero to hulk mode, it's probably not about the coffee. i spent months researching this (books, neuroscience podcasts, therapy literature) because i was tired of feeling like a ticking time bomb. turns out our anger response is way more complex than ""just calm down bro.""

**1. your nervous system is probably running on fumes**

when you're chronically stressed, your body stays in fight or flight mode. your cortisol is elevated, your nervous system is hypervigilant, and basically you're walking around with a hair trigger. that's not a character flaw, that's biology. dr gabor maté talks about this extensively in ""when the body says no"" (dude's a trauma expert who's worked with everyone from addicts to cancer patients). the book absolutely wrecked me in the best way. he explains how unresolved stress literally rewires your brain to perceive threats everywhere. 

the fix? you need to actively calm your nervous system down. sounds obvious but most people never actually do it. try the physiological sigh, this breath work technique andrew huberman (stanford neuroscientist) breaks down on his podcast. two quick inhales through your nose, long exhale through your mouth. it literally signals your vagus nerve to chill out. do it before you feel angry, not during.

**2. you're probably not sleeping or eating right**

i know, revolutionary advice. but seriously, when you're sleep deprived or running on sugar crashes, your prefrontal cortex (the part that stops you from being an asshole) basically goes offline. your amygdala (rage center) takes over. 

book rec here: ""why we sleep"" by matthew walker. he's a UC berkeley sleep scientist and this book is legitimately the best thing i've read on sleep optimization. won the royal society science book prize. after reading it i stopped doom scrolling at 2am and my baseline irritability dropped like 60%. he breaks down exactly how sleep deprivulation murders your emotional regulation.

also track your blood sugar. the app ""levels"" or ""nutrisense"" can show you in real time how food affects your mood through continuous glucose monitoring. sounds intense but seeing the correlation between my anger spikes and blood sugar crashes was wild.

**3. there's probably old shit you haven't processed**

this is the uncomfortable part. a lot of quick anger is actually other emotions in disguise. grief, shame, fear, vulnerability. anger feels powerful, those other feelings feel weak, so your brain defaults to rage. especially if you grew up in an environment where expressing sadness or fear wasn't safe.

""the body keeps the score"" by bessel van der kolk changed how i understand this. van der kolk is like THE trauma researcher, harvard psychiatrist, decades of work with PTSD patients. this book will make you question everything you think you know about why you react the way you do. he explains how trauma (even ""small"" stuff) gets stored in your body and hijacks your emotional responses years later.

pair that with therapy. the app ""better help"" gets memed on but it's genuinely accessible if traditional therapy isn't an option. or try ""ash"" for relationship and emotional coaching. sometimes you just need someone to help you connect the dots between your childhood dinner table dynamics and why you lose it in traffic.

**4. you're not creating space between trigger and response**

viktor frankl said ""between stimulus and response there is a space. in that space is our power to choose our response."" cool quote, but how do you actually create that space when you're pissed?

practice when you're NOT angry. meditation sounds cringe but it's literally training your brain to observe thoughts without reacting. the app ""waking up"" by sam harris is insanely good for this. harris is a neuroscientist and philosopher, and his approach is completely secular and science based, none of that woo woo stuff. ten minutes daily for a month and you'll notice yourself catching anger before it fully takes over.

also try the ""name it to tame it"" technique from dr dan siegel's work. when you feel anger rising, literally label it out loud. ""i'm feeling angry because i feel disrespected."" sounds dumb but it activates your prefrontal cortex and diminishes the emotional intensity by like 30 to 40 percent according to fMRI studies.

if you want something that ties all these resources together in a way that actually sticks, there's this AI learning app called BeFreed that a friend at Google recommended. it pulls from books like ""the body keeps the score,"" research on emotional regulation, and expert insights on anger management, then creates personalized audio learning plans based on your specific struggles. you can customize the depth (quick 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive with examples) and even pick a voice that doesn't annoy you. 

the adaptive plan feature is clutch because you can set a goal like ""stop rage spiraling over minor inconveniences"" and it builds a structured path just for you, adjusting as you progress. plus there's this virtual coach avatar you can chat with about your unique triggers, which sounds gimmicky but is actually helpful when you're trying to connect patterns between your reactions and root causes. way more convenient than juggling five different books and podcasts.

**5. you might be hanging around angry people**

emotions are contagious. if your friend group or family communicates primarily through irritation and snapping, you're gonna adopt that. not your fault but it is your responsibility to either set boundaries or find people who model better emotional regulation.

the podcast ""where should we begin"" by esther perel has incredible episodes on communication patterns in relationships. she's a psychotherapist who literally records real therapy sessions (with permission obviously). listening to how other people navigate conflict helped me realize how dysfunctional my default responses were.

**6. you're not moving your body enough**

anger is physical energy. if you don't discharge it through exercise it just builds up. you don't need to become a gym bro but you need SOME form of intense physical activity. boxing, running, lifting, whatever gets your heart rate up and makes you sweat.

when i feel rage building i do burpees until i'm dead. sounds ridiculous but it works. you literally cannot stay angry when you're gasping for air. your body shifts from sympathetic (fight mode) to parasympathetic (recovery mode) nervous system activation.

look, managing anger isn't about becoming some zen monk who never feels anything. anger is useful, it tells you your boundaries are being violated. but the goal is responding instead of reacting. choosing your battles instead of fighting everything. most stuff genuinely doesn't matter, and the stuff that does matter deserves a thoughtful response not an explosion.

your anger probably developed as a protective mechanism at some point. maybe it kept you safe or helped you survive a chaotic environment. but if it's now damaging your relationships and making you miserable, it's time to update the software. you're not broken, you're just running outdated programming. these tools can help you rewrite it.",1,1769706125.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

Systemic symptoms of nickel allergy can include **respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms** from eating foods that contain nickel (or an implanted device that contains nickel).\[[ref](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24674689/)\]

For example, someone with a nickel allergy may end up with nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and fatigue. Neurological symptoms include headaches and brain fog.\[[ref](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17842-nickel-allergy)\]

Nickel is found in trace amounts in the soils, and plants can take up nickel through their roots. This means that plants can contain nickel, which can then cause systemic nickel allergy syndrome symptoms.

On average, we consume 300-600 μg of nickel per day. For someone very sensitive to nickel, the top end of this range could cause symptoms such as eczema.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3667300/)\]

# Response to nickel:

So what happens when soluble nickel is taken into a cell? Nickel causes the cell to increase inflammation and oxidative stress. This can lead to cell death at higher levels. The Nrf2 pathway is essential in the response to oxidative stress, and researchers have found that Nrf2 is upregulated with nickel exposure.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6921378/)\]

Another study looked at inflammation over the course of three days after exposure using skin biopsies in nickel allergy patients. The researchers found that natural killer cells are upregulated, and memory T cells are activated. The response was not immediate and built over a couple of days.\[[ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7984291/)\]

You two would be an instant anime-and-art power couple. Both 15, both super into anime (her Honkai and manga obsession, his Gurren Lagann hype and mythology deep-dives), both draw (even if he calls himself trash), and both play Minecraft/Roblox for chill co-op worlds. She’s extroverted and goofy, he’s mixed and independent but loves letters and romantic gestures. You’d spend hours ranting about peak scenes, sharing sketches, and building in-game date spots. It’s the kind of connection that starts with memes and ends with late-night “you’re my favorite person” messages.

2. sageyxx\_4044 (16 Genderfluid, seeking Female) & MyNameDoesntMatter11 (18F, seeking Male)

This feels like a soft, creative slow-burn. Ages are close enough, both introverted and guarded at first, but once trust clicks you’d open up. Minecraft is your shared safe space, plus her drawing/writing/reading vibes match your South Park humor and fandom energy perfectly. She wants caring, patient energy (you’d fit the bill), and you both prefer actions over constant words. Quiet voice chats, shared playlists, and doodling together while talking about weird shows—it’d feel cozy, understanding, and genuinely sweet.

3. ab080238 (assumed Male, seeking Female) & Spoiled\_brat15 (15F, seeking Male)

She’s 15, poetic, loves Brooklyn Nine-Nine for the laughs and clever writing, writes poetry, solves Rubik’s cubes, and plays light Roblox. You’d vibe on the humor and nerdy side immediately. Both of you are guarded from past burns but crave honest, mature people who actually plan things out. She loves public affection and hand-holding once she’s comfy—you’d give her the occasional sweet words she needs. Late-night sitcom binges, puzzle challenges, and her sending you little poems that make you smile. It’d feel fun, light, and slowly romantic.

4. redacted\_since\_2021 (assumed Male, seeking Female) & aur0ra3171 (15F, seeking Male)

High-energy anime duo. She’s extroverted, draws like crazy, lives for Honkai and manga, and plays Minecraft. You’d feed off each other’s hype—marathon episodes, scream about plot twists, collab on fan art. Both of you stay guarded but open up completely once you feel safe. She plans surprises and loves closeness; you’d match that with equal decisions and public affection vibes. It’d be loud laughs, chaotic voice chats, and that rare feeling of “someone finally gets my brain.”

5. xd.random. (assumed Male, seeking Female) & MyNameDoesntMatter11 (18F, seeking Male)

Introvert creative match made in quiet heaven. She’s 18, loves Minecraft/Roblox/Genshin, draws, writes, reads, and watches quirky stuff like The Amazing Digital Circus. Both of you are shy about affection at first but crave caring, patient people who don’t judge. Balanced independence with occasional “you’re important” texts would keep things steady. Gaming sessions that turn into deep late-night talks about life, art shares, and just existing together comfortably. Feels empathetic, low-pressure, and real.

6. qwerty (assumed Male, seeking Female) & Spoiled\_brat15 (15F, seeking Male)

Classic comedy-nerd chemistry. She’s all about Brooklyn Nine-Nine, poetry, puzzles, and planning cute things. You’d match her humor and structured energy perfectly. Both guarded but value maturity and good jokes. Roblox for casual hangs, her sending you silly letters or poems, you surprising her with memes or playlist drops. It’d start as banter and slowly become the kind of sweet, thoughtful connection where you both feel seen.

7. quandappledingle (assumed Male, seeking Female) & lee\_motorcyclelover (13F, seeking Male)

Super young, super chill. She’s 13, plays volleyball, reads, doomscrolls, loves Arcane, and wants someone nice, cool, and Muslim-friendly. You’d click on the hyper-but-chill energy and shared low-key vibes. Both bottle feelings up but risk opening for real connection. Light gaming hangs, show recommendations, and gentle check-ins. It’d feel safe, playful, and like two kids figuring out friendship that might turn into first-crush butterflies.

8. Skinny\_Vok (18M, seeking Female) & MyNameDoesntMatter11 (18F, seeking Male)

Same-age creative gamers who’d actually finish projects together. Minecraft/Valorant for duo nights, he makes music/draws/edits/collects LEGOs, she draws/writes/reads. Both open up fully when they trust, love balanced space, and want honesty/open-mindedness. Coffee dates (virtual or real), sharing random creations, and late-night talks about cars, art, and life. Feels passionate, artistic, and like you’re building something real side-by-side.

9. Sero\_002 (14M, seeking Female) & aur0ra3171 (15F, seeking Male)

Young, sporty-anime vibe that clicks fast. He’s 14, athletic (volleyball, soccer, MMA, piano), plays Minecraft/Roblox/Monster Hunter, and wants patient, supportive people who like animals. She’s 15, extroverted anime freak who draws, loves Honkai/manga/gaming, and craves closeness with equal decisions. Both guarded but open when trusted—perfect for voice chats about Invincible vs Andor, piano covers of anime OSTs, and building trust through shared wins. Feels energetic, loyal, and full of hype moments.

10. Azero957 (15M, seeking Female) & Spoiled\_brat15 (15F, seeking Male)

Nerdy 15-year-old soulmates. Mythology/anime/writing/drawing + Gurren Lagann hype meets her poetry/sitcoms/Rubik’s love. Minecraft/Roblox for worlds, both risk real sharing, want non-toxic people who match hobbies. Letter-style romance + planning dates = deep talks and hype reactions. Feels intellectual, passionate, and like you found your person to geek out with forever.

11. qoew (18M, seeking Female) & PristineDonut-22 (19M, seeking Everyone)

Chill, active introvert duo. Running + guitar/tech/reading/coffee overlap. Both mixed, seek empathetic/stable partners, balanced closeness with check-ins. Public/shy affection mix for quiet reassurance. Virtual runs, music shares, and deep talks about The Pitt vs Office. Feels supportive, grounded, and like two people who actually make each other feel less alone.

My older brother, has always been the generous one in our family. He is working incredibly hard to get a comfortable place in his career but since he started dating six months ago, he’s like a different person. He’s constantly stressed, working double shifts just to fund a lifestyle that his gf demands.

Last night, my brother came over to borrow some money for his so called utilities. I was shocked because he makes a great salary. When I asked where his savings went, he told me he just paid for a luxury trip for his gf's birthday.

I finally snapped. I told him that I don't think his gf actually likes him and she only likes his credit card. I pointed out that she never offers to pay for even a coffee, and every time they travel, he’s the one lugging the bags while she’s busy tagging herself at five-star resorts on Instagram. I told him he’s being used as a human ATM and a personal travel agent.

My brother got incredibly defensive. He told me I was being bitter and small-minded. He said that his gf is a high-maintenance woman who deserves the best and that if I were a supportive sister, I’d be happy he found someone he wants to spoil. He even said that my jealousy is the reason we aren't as close as we used to be.

Now our parents are involved. They called me this morning and told me to stay out of it. My mom said, If it makes him happy to spend his money on her, that’s his business, and that I’m creating drama where there shouldn't be any. They think I should apologize for insulting his girlfriend’s character.

My best friend is the only one on my side, saying it’s painful to watch a sibling get drained dry by a gold-digger. But with my whole family acting like I’m the villain for being concerned about his bank account and his future, I’m starting to doubt myself. Am I being too judgmental? Should I just shut up and watch him go broke?

What do I do? How can I get him to see the red flags without losing my relationship with him?",0,1769705911.0,offmychest,4,0.5,False

“Confirmed, *Flying Dutchman*, welcome to the Addrius System,” came the response. “What is the reason for your visit?”

“Currently we are dropping off a passenger for vacation, and have some bounties to turn in.”

“Confirmed. You are cleared to land at Addrius Station 10, bay C31. There is a bounty office there as well as a teleporter to get to the surface of Addrius V for your passenger. Please be advised that you will have some questions and an inspection before you or your passenger will be allowed to leave your ship.”

“Confirmed,” Athena said. “We will begin sharing our location information. Landing is estimated to be 30 minutes.”

“Copy that, we have your signal,” came the response. “Again, we welcome you to the Addrius system, and we hope you have a pleasant stay with us.”

“Are inspections common for vacation planets?” Eric asked as Athena cut the comm line.

“Not typically,” Shtaran said, watching the viewscreen as Adam flew them to the designated station. They were silent for a moment as they considered what could be going on. “Oh, did you remember to file the paperwork for your name change before you left?”

“Sonuvabitch,” Eric said, slapping his face with his hand. “We literally changed it right when you showed up, so it completely slipped my mind.”

“That would do it,” Shtaran said as the station came into view. “Your IFF tag doesn’t match your ship name, so they’re suspicious of smuggling or other criminal activity. I wouldn’t worry too much. Once you explain what happened, the inspection should be relatively simple to get through.”

………………………………..

It was, in fact, not simple. At least, not once the Station inspectors found the whiskey, vodka, bourbon, and scotch. It took almost three hours of explaining human biology, Shtaran showing her credentials, and a Thrrrrrktinik doctor to come and inspect everyone, before they were allowed to leave their ship, with strict instructions that the hard alcohol was not to leave the ship under any circumstances. Things became slightly more complicated when Athena was discovered as an android rather than a human but seeing as there was nothing against the law in her case, station security simply said that if anything went wrong then they would be held liable.

“Sounds like we’re going to have to get a license for alcohol now as well,” Jeremiah said, tapping his arm as he thought.

“That would be a good idea,” Shtaran agreed, her bags at her feet. “Well, thanks for the ride.”

“If we’re in the area when you leave, we’ll be happy to give you a ride back,” Eric said warmly, shaking Shtaran’s hand. Sandra just gave her a hug, not saying anything as Shtaran smiled.

“I would like that very much,” Shtaran admitted.

“Here,” Athena said robotically, her hands holding out a small bag. “It’s some coffee to help with your vacation. I have also taken the liberty of sending directions to your datapad for it’s safe consumption.”

“That’s actually amazing, thank you Athena,” Shtaran said with a smile, taking the bag. She placed it in her luggage before picking it up and walking towards the teleporter. “I’ll see you people around.”

“Have fun!” Jeremiah called out.

“And remember to keep practicing,” Jessica added. “I want to see what ability you develop next time we meet.” Shtaran waved again before disappearing behind a door. “Alright, what’s the plan?”

“Well, we need to go to the bounty office and turn in our bounties, check to see if there are any jobs in the area, and while it wasn’t much it would probably be a good idea to restock whatever supplies we’ve used,” Jeremiah said, tapping his chin as he thought.

“May I make a request?” Athena asked.

“You’re part of the team, so of course,” Eric said as he felt Sandra climb up his back.

“I would like to check electronics and prosthetic shops,” Athena said, rubbing her arm. “I appear to be getting more data errors as I continue to interact with people and need more memory and processing power. While I can say with certainty that I am functionally fully operational, the errors are causing me some concerns as both debugging and virus sweeps have come up empty multiple times.”

“We can definitely do that,” Jeremiah said. “Shao, Quin, you two are our resident engineer and software people, can you go with her?”

“Of course,” Quin said.

“It would be a good idea to look around a bit anyway,” Shao said. “I want to see if I can increase the engine performance and decrease the load with the weapons a bit.”

“Oh, can I go with the flyboy to the bounty office?” Jessica asked. “I want to see his face when they explain how badly he screwed it up again.”

“Yeah, yeah, I’d love to see you do better,” Adam shot back.

“That works for me,” Jeremiah said.

“I’ll check the markets for food and such,” Eric said, hoisting Sandra a bit so that she sat a little more comfortably on his shoulders. “I realized with Shtaran that any transport jobs are mostly going to be non-human, so I’d like to see if I can’t get some recipes and ingredients that cater more to the species, rather than trying to dilute human food.”

“Good call,” Jeremiah said. “I’ll take a look at the forums then and see if there’s any freelance work for us, get the paperwork for our ships name change done, and look into getting an alcohol license while I’m at it.” They all broke off, each walking in different directions for their respective tasks.

“Human food is so tasty,” Sandra said quietly as they were walking the market. “Why change it?”

“Some human food can be dangerous to other races,” Eric explained as he examined an odd ‘fruit’. “Shtaran and you both were alright with our meals, but if we had tried to serve, say, the extra spicy tacos to a Mlamcar, they would have needed medical attention quickly. Also, some recipes call for alcohol, and while the majority of alcohol is cooked out, that doesn’t mean it’s safe for a species that can only have minuscule amounts safely.”

“Oh,” Sandra thought about it. “So, like how you need to modify some of your workouts so that I can do them with my tail?”

“Something like that,” Eric agreed. “Speaking of which, I want to have a doctor get a look at you?”

“How come?”

“You’ve been eating a lot for a Targondian lately, right?” Eric said as he spotted a clinic and began heading in that direction. “I just want to make sure that it’s not going to be a problem and cause potential health problems for you.”

“Oh,” Sandra said. “So, it’s bad that I’m eating a lot?”

“I don’t know,” Eric said, “but that’s what I want to find out. if It is, I’m sure we can find a compromise so that you can continue to eat with us.” Eric walked into the clinic to find what looked like a four-armed female werewolf working at the reception counter.

“Good day to you, customers,” the werewolf said cheerfully, two of her arms working on the computer while the other two were working on what looked like a very confusing puzzle cube. “What can I do for you today?”

“Yeah, uh, hi. I wanted to get a checkup on my Ward here,” Eric said, lifting Sandra off of his shoulders to put her on the ground. “She’s been eating more than we think is typical of a Targondian, and I wanted to make sure it won’t affect her negatively.”

“That does sound odd,” The werewolf woman said, looking down at the computer. “So, the Doctor is currently with a patient, but he should be out in about 30 minutes or less if you would like to wait?”

“That sounds great, thank you,” Eric said.

“Alright, and what name do we put down?”

“Tsandrasto Everflow and Eric Gibson,” Eric said while the receptionist continued to type on the computer. “Also, I’m sorry to ask, but I don’t recognize your race. What species are you?”

“Oh, no worries at all,” the werewolf woman gave Eric a small smile. “I am a Wolfaritan. I’m guessing this is your first time to a vacation planet?”

“No, but this is the first time I’ve been off ship at a vacation planet,” Eric answered.

“Well, you will find us quite common around most vacation planets,” the woman said, finally getting the puzzle cube apart and starting to put it back together. “Our culture is one of hospitality and peace, so many vacation spots like us for our manners when dealing with guests.”

“Oh, that is very informative,” Eric said. “Thank you, ma’am.”

“Of course,” the Wolfaritan said. “If you would like to take a seat, the doctor will be with you shortly.”

“Of course,” Eric said. He sat down, Sandra choosing a seat next to him as she pulled out her datapad to play some puzzles while they waited. A Porishta walked out of the office 20 minutes later, and Eric and Sandra were taken to the back, where a very annoyed looking Thrrrrrktinik was sitting on a bowl-chair.

“So, the Targondian has been eating a lot?” the Thrrrrrktinik doctor asked, getting straight into it. Sandra grasped Eric’s pants, but Eric just smiled.

“Yeah, doc, I just wanted to make sure she was alright,” Eric said.

“Right,” the Thrrrrrktinik doctor said, a ceiling tile coming down next to the bed with various scanning equipment. “Well, girl, I don’t have all day. Get on the bed for me.”

“It’s ok, Sandra,” Eric assured her as Sandra looked at him. “Think of him like the doctor from the Maricar.” Andra nodded slowly before slowly getting onto the bed, eyeing the doctor warily as he picked up several tools with his tentacles. Eric watched as the doctor managed to get scans from different angles, a blood sample, and a saliva sample within the span of a few seconds before placing the equipment back into their places and moving the bowl-chair to the computer.

“Well, medically she seems fine, if a bit stronger than other Targondians her age,” the doctor said, reading the screen. “Are you feeding or doing anything different.”

“She lives with me and 5 other humans, as well as an android,” Eric said. “We tend to eat three times a day, but she’s mentioned that she used to only need a few meals a week in order to survive. Admittedly she doesn’t eat much each meal, but she does always try to join us and have at least a few bites.”

“And the ingredients?”

“We’ve been staying away from anything that we know will have an adverse effect on Targondian biology, or making an alternative,” Eric said. “Also, I have a habit of going to the gym in the mornings, and she’s been joining me for them, though some of the workouts are unsuitable for her.”

“Ok,” the doctor said, tapping a few things. “Well, aside from maybe a little too much salt, she looks to be in good health. Despite what people think, Targondians do eat daily, but they do have a slower metabolism. She hasn’t been trying to eat as much as humans, is she?”

“No, I’ve repeatedly emphasized that she needs to stop eating when she’s getting full,” Eric said.

“Then I’d say she’s doing just fine. While it’s not common, Targondians can eat multiple times in a day, but it’s closer to what other species would consider snacking than a full meal. And yes, they can survive off of a few meals a week, but it’s not necessarily healthy unless they need to be on a diet being overweight. She’s stronger, no doubt because of joining you in the gym, but not overweight,” the doctor explained in his brusque tone. “the only thing I would recommend would be to maybe lower the salt content a bit, or to drink more liquids, but otherwise she seems perfectly healthy.”

“Is that why she’s been much more active in the ship?”

“Targondian children are as hyper as other children,” the doctor said. “You just typically don’t see it outside of their home due to their introverted nature. So if she’s being active while being raised by 6 crazy people and a robot, congrats, you’re trusted family to her.”

“Hey, we aren’t crazy,” Eric protested as Sandra looked back and forth between the doctor and Eric.

“You’re humans, I will automatically assume some level of insanity until proven otherwise, which I have yet to be proven,” the doctor snapped. “Now, I’m going to send you a few files for Targondian workouts so that you have a better frame of reference for your morning exercise. Beyond that, get out of my clinic. I have more important work to do than look over healthy individuals.”

“Got it,” Eric said, standing up as Sandra got off of the bed. “Thanks, Doc.”

“Thank me by leaving,” the doctor growled before slipping through a hole in the wall.

“Oh, how did things go?” the Wolfaritan woman asked as they were leaving.

“Apparently, perfectly healthy, just a misunderstanding,” Eric said as he pulled out a credit chip for the bill.

“And let me guess, the good doctor was very annoyed about it?” the woman asked, taking the chip and pulling up the surprisingly small bill for Eric to look over.

“I’ve dealt with the octopi doctors before, so I expected it,” Eric said with a small chuckle. “They really hate anything that’s not related to research, don’t they? What I’m more surprised is to see a Thurtinik (Eric knew he botched the pronunciation but could never actually say it properly) running a clinic instead of being at a hospital or on a ship.”

“He’s one of the oddballs of their species,” the woman said as Eric accepted the charges as she began to run his credit chip while also working on what looks like a puzzle ball this time. “He said that just because he prefers research doesn’t mean that people need to lose an arm in order to be healthy. In his words, ‘It’s less hassle if I fix them before they become a problem and I have to spend the next two cycles in surgery.’”

“You know what, that tracks for their species,” Eric said good naturedly, accepting his chip back as Sandra watched the receptionist work the puzzle ball with fascination. “Also, what are you working on there?”

“Oh, these?” the woman held up the ball and the cube from before. “My brother likes to create puzzles, and he asked me to help him test a few of them. As long as I get my work done the doctor doesn’t mind, and I have extra hands.” She shrugged. “It helps pass the time.”

“Interesting,” Eric said as he watched Sandra. “Does your brother happen to have a shop on station by chance?”

“He does,” the receptionist said, smiling as she was slowly disassembling the ball while Sandra watched. “B-Block market, it’s a small shop called Karon’s Puzzles. When you get there, tell him Kari sent you, he’ll help you find whatever you want.”

“Thank you very much, Kari,” Eric said, taking Sandra’s hand.

“You two have a wonderful day,” Kari said, waving as they left. Sandra waved back a bit shyly as the door closed.

…………………………………….

“And can you please have that delivered to *The Flying Dutchman* at C31 please?” Eric asked the store manager.

“of course, that’s part of our order deals,” the Porishta said, minimizing the holoscreen. “Anything else for you today?”

“Nope, I think that should top us off,” Eric said, tapping his chin. “If we do need anything else though then I’ll most likely be back.”

“Thank you for your business,” the Porishta said as they walked out. Sandra was happily trying to figure out a puzzle cube similar to the one Kari had been working on at the clinic, and Eric just smiled.

“Well, I think that covers supplies,” Eric said. “Anything else you want to look around for?” Sandra just shook her head as a piece popped out of the cube, opening another section for her.

“Sandra, Eric, fancy seeing you here,” came a familiar call. Eric looked around until he saw Jeremiah walking towards them, waving. Sandra waved back briefly before going back to her cube.

“Hey, Jeremiah,” Eric said, waving back. “Everything good on your end?”

“Paperwork is official for the *Dutchman*, payment received for the transport job, and we’ve been put back into the queue for any other transportation or cargo work.”

“Nothing for bounty hunting or mercenary work?”

“Mercenary work is slim around here apparently, aside from guarding the occasional convoy,” Jeremiah said, joining them as they began walking back to their ship. “And mercenary work is attack of opportunity anyway, so we can do that with other jobs, as long as the passenger and/or cargo is our top priority.”

“That’s fair,” Eric said. “The alcohol license?”

“Solid, but it took some wrangling,” Jeremiah admitted. “They did not like the fact that we have stuff considered poison or even cleaning solution, and liked it even less that we had the capabilities of making more. It actually took a call to Earth to get it approved, though we are not allowed to sell it or serve it to customers without severely diluting it.”

“I mean, that’s just common sense,” Eric complained. “Do they think so little of us?”

“Have you met humans?” Jeremiah laughed. “I’m honestly shocked at some of the stupidity I’ve seen. Common sense ain’t so common for us.”

“Ok, valid, but still,” Eric said, chuckling as well.

“And what are you working on, little lady?” Jeremiah asked Sandra. She showed him the puzzle cube, which he examined a bit before handing it back to her. “I think I’ll leave that to you smart ones,” he said, making Sandra giggle a bit as she nodded. “Reminds me a bit of a cross between a Rubik’s cube and those brain teasers you have to take apart.”

“It also has three separate layers to fill in, so a Russian doll was thrown in there at some point,” Eric agreed. “Makes my head heart just thinking about trying to take it apart, get the colors right, and then put it all back together.”

“Oof, no thank you,” Jeremiah winced.

“Heard about them from a nice Wolfaritan at the clinic,” Eric said as they got onto an auto-walk.

“Ain’t that those werewolf people?” Jeremiah asked. Eric nodded. “Nice. So, what did the doc say about Sandra?”

“Perfectly healthy, just a misunderstanding,” Eric said. “He did recommend either a bit more water, or slightly less salty food, but otherwise she’s healthy. Apparently Targondians eat more than people think, mostly because of their introverted nature as a species. And the kids are just as hyper as other kids, if they feel like they’re in a safe and comfortable environment.”

“Ah, ok, I can get behind that,” Jeremiah said.

“He was also nice enough to send me a few workouts specifically designed for Targondians for Sandra when she’s in the gym with me.”

 “Octopus doctor?”

“Yup.” Eric popped the P as he said it.

“That tracks,” Jeremiah laughed. “Grouchy as hell but ensuring you are healthy and stay healthy.”

“Maybe we should look into trying to hire one for the ship?” Eric said, thinking. “I know our medical bay is automated for some of the important work, but it would be a good idea to get someone who knows what their doing, rather than a bunch of people with field training rather than an actual medical degree.”

“Something to look into,” Jeremiah agreed as they walked into their hanger. “I doubt we can get one of the octopi, but having a dedicated doctor would be a good idea. I’ll post something on the job listings, see if we can’t find someone before our next job.”

“Doubtful, but worth a shot,” Eric said, opening the airlock to the *Dutchman*.

Well it's much more complicated than it looks . Being in a place where someone dumps you out of nowhere is the most miserable position you can be in a break-up.

Well today let's grab some coffee and dive deep into stages for different attachment styles breakup cycles. I have personally seen about 100 breakups in my life , I am 34 year old and I have been into few long term relationships.

FIRST LETS TALK ABOUT SECURE DUMPERS 

(1) Breakups with secure individuals often happen in cases which are not solvable , either getting stucked with an avoidant or an anxious person 

(2) Secure leaning dumpers try to contribute and work on the relationship, they try to solve problems. They often try atleast few times to point out problems and actively wish to work on them .

(3) Secure leaning individuals can often become avoidant or anxious for short terms based on their partner's behaviour. If they are with an avoidant, they often get anxious and try to fill what's missing. With anxious they sometimes behave like avoidant after getting bombarded by constant reassurance seeking attempts of anxious 

(4)  These people often after breakup go through clear and predictable stages , often including 

RELIEF  , ANXIETY, ANGER , CONFUSION, SELF BLAME  followed  by either  GUILT or ACCEPTANCE based on their behaviour and contribution in the relationship.

These type of dumpers may come back more often than others but every situation is different.

Secure people contribute around 55 percent of the population.



SECOND ARE ANXIOUS DUMPERS 

(1) They often try every single way to make the relationship work out , atleast it's what they think. They are in mostly fear of getting left out which sometimes sabotages the relationship 

(2) If paired with Avoidant partner their core wound is activated and they often feel walking on eggshells. The constant hot and cold behaviour from the partner keeps them hooked to their partner 

(3) Eventually often after exhaustion of trying to get understood the anxious partner gives up . They are often the givers of the relationship and most of the times they are the one holding the relationship altogether.

(4) Anxious dumpers often had tried every way to make the relationship work , they have already grieved the relationship while being neglected or feeling like that so , their burnout causes them to finally give up .

(5) After the breakup anxious dumpers sometimes know that this will hurt them , but pain of staying gets bigger than pain of leaving . They get into deep pain after the breakup but deep inside they have made their decision.

(6) After burnout anxious partners leave their emotional side and start thinking from logic rather than emotions , this usually makes their ex think that they are being mean but often it's because anxious partner has given up being the sole contributer .

The stages they often go through are as followed 

BURNOUT , RATIONALISATION, GRIEF , ANGER , DEPRESSION, GUILT FOR STAYING LONG , AND GRADUAL ACCEPTANCE.

Sometimes these individuals get stuck to their ex for so long . But not in every case 


NOW THE THIRD ONES ( THE AVOIDANTS ) 

(1) FEARFUL AVOIDANTS behave often hot and cold in the relationship, they get engulfed by pressure of the relationship and eventually shut down , this behaviour over the times becomes toxic and frustrating for the partner. Though fearful avoidants often feel the emotions intensely they lack the ability to portray it 

(2) DA/FA often discard their partners with same manner, they lack accountability and actually don't know what the real issues are . They often feel trapped when things get intimate and intense. They often feel need to scape . These individuals are highly focused on freedom and often think being too close can hurt their freedom .

(3) When they end the relationship, there's very little chance that they would give you any closure, it's not because they are evil , but often because they too don't know why they are doing that . The breakup feels rough for the partner and avoidant often behaves like the coldest person to exist 

(4) These individuals are often cause of the breakup where when their partner wanted to solve a problem in the relationship they ran away . Usually things get piled up and avoidant decided it won't work out .

Their usual stages after breakup are as followed 

MASSIVE RELIEF (LASTING FEW WEEKS TO FEW MONTHS) , 
CONFUSION, BREADCRUMBS, EMOTIONAL LEAKAGE , DEEP REGRET AND SHAME , DEPRESSION, ACCEPTANCE. 





THOUGH ACCEPTANCE IN ALL THREE ATTACHMENT STYLES IS A POSSIBILITY, PEOPLE CAN ALSO LONG FOR THEIR EX FOR VERY LONG .

when i was in highschool i swore up and down that i was bisexual. i would date ugly ass white boys with no eyebrows and swore on my life i loved them. and then half of the boys i dated, i only dated them cause they looked like masc lesbians✌️

tbh i know that's an asshole move but i wasn't doing it on purpose, it just happened. and all my make celebrity crushes were always feminine in some sort of way (Christian Bale lmao i can't think of him without thinking of howl from howls moving castle). 

and my last straw was this guy imma calllllll Jared. now Jared and i are both poc and i have this little rule where i don't really date white people much, so i honestly thought we would be okay since ""both""(you'll understand the quotations later) of us are Mexican and we could bond over culture. thing is im also black. and he LOVEDDDD his little jokes. i remember one time he tried to make a ""that's how i like my coffee black and blah blah blah."" like dawg what are we doing. and he would constantly for some reason get an urge to tell me how racist his family is. he would go on and on about how his grandfather fought in Vietnam and now hates his Korean step mom(what??). of course from time to time i would ask because i didn't want to visit a racist family but i literally only asked this man once and then he went on the tell me his family's confederate history. bruh i didn't ask for that crap. 

and it wasn't even just that, everything he did just made me cringe out. he would text me goodmorning texts and i would act like that completely normal thing was so disgusting i would seriously think, ""ew why is he telling me he loves me."" and he would be all cuddly in public and it was disgusting.

i know you may be thinking i just didn't have feelings for this guy but i would outwardly turn around and cling to my girl friends and say how fine they are and give the same ""i love you"" texts to them. also yes, i was huge asshole in highschool i did in fact cheat on this guy with multiple girls and im not at all proud of it- im grown now and haven't pulled that stupid shit since. please just break up with someone if you no longer have feelings for them and don't try to be some player😭

I’ve spent an embarrassing amount of time obsessed with something most people probably find boring: old maps.

You know those old nostalgic moments when you fall into a Wikipedia rabbit hole at 2AM reading about Roman engineering or random historical events? That’s basically been my life for the past few years.

So I built the thing I always wished existed: ChronoAtlas, an interactive historical map explorer where you can dive into different eras and explore how the ancient world looked.

Right now you can explore things like the Roman Empire, Alexander the Great’s empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Dutch Golden Age. On top of that, there are historical layers you can toggle, including ancient battles, sieges, political events, religious milestones, trade routes, and thousands of ancient locations.

The part that honestly gets me emotional is when you zoom into a random place and realize people lived there, traded there, and fell in love there thousands of years ago. Most of the time History classes gave us dates to memorize, I wanted to build something that gives people stories and a sense of connection instead.

Tech-wise (if you care), it’s built with a Laravel backend, MapLibre GL for map rendering, georeferenced historical maps from museum archives, and way too much coffee.

It’s completely free. No ads. No login walls. No “subscribe to unlock more” nonsense. I’d genuinely love for people to explore it and tell me what feels broken, what they like, or what regions they’d want to see added next.

Check it out:

https://chronoatlas.nl/

I noticed things about the industry that I honestly had no idea about. Apparently, people love coming to a restaurant just for chit-chat. I never used to do this not even taking my laptop to a cafe because I don't know how people can really focus in all that noise and people but to each their own. I can somewhat understand with a cafe but a restaurant? 

People would come to my restaurant, 2 friends or just a meeting and only order coffee. Now where I am from that is confusing to me as you know this is a restaurant not your meetup spot unless the meetup is lunch or eating food together obviously. I will give them the benefit of doubt, maybe the coffee at that establishment is really good. But that doesn't justify you to sit there on a table for 4 hours. I have seen many people treating it like a cafe and it baffles me honestly. It's not cheap to keep a restaurant up, not in 2026.

approx 7000 restaurants closed down last year alone in canada. If you don't plan on eating then stay home or pick a better spot just like when you go to theatres you go there to watch a movie.

That the desk lamp hadn’t tilted on its own.

That the smell—old paper, cold coffee, something metallic—had always been there.

But the truth was simple.

The office was changing around me.

I had been sitting at that desk for… I checked my watch out of habit. The hands were still stuck at 2:17 a.m. They had been for days. Maybe longer. The glass was cracked now, like something had pressed against it from the inside.

The station was still silent. Too silent. No footsteps. No radios. No city sounds leaking in from outside. Riverton felt like it had been erased, leaving only this room and me inside it.

I opened the bottom drawer of my desk, looking for the old case log. My fingers brushed against something warm.

A file.

I didn’t remember putting it there.

The cover read: INCIDENT REPORT – CHIEF MERCER.

My name.

Inside were photographs. Grainy, black-and-white. Me at my desk. Me asleep in the chair. Me staring at the door like I was waiting for someone who never came.

The timestamps went back years.

That was impossible. I hadn’t been chief that long.

A noise made me look up.

Someone was standing across the room.

Not an officer. Not exactly.

He wore a uniform that looked almost right—badge slightly warped, nameplate unreadable, like it had been scratched away too many times. His face… I couldn’t focus on it. Every time I tried, my eyes slid off, like my brain refused to finish drawing him.

“You’ve been busy,” he said, nodding toward the file.

“Who are you?” I asked.

He smiled. “You know who I am. You just stopped writing me down.”

I reached for my radio. Still dead.

“You don’t leave your desk anymore,” he continued, circling slowly. “That used to mean something. Dedication. Control. Now it just means you’re… stuck.”

“I leave,” I said automatically.

He stopped beside the window and tapped the glass.

“Then why is it still dark outside?”

I turned.

The rain hadn’t moved. Each drop was frozen mid-fall, like the city itself was holding its breath.

My chest tightened. “What happened here?”

“What always happens,” he replied. “Things get buried. People disappear. And someone has to stay behind to make sure the paperwork looks clean.”

He leaned in close.

“That someone is you.”

Memories surfaced—ones I didn’t remember remembering. Reports I’d signed without reading. Complaints I’d postponed. A night when an officer knocked on my door and I told him, Tomorrow.

Tomorrow never came.

The figure stepped back toward the doorway. “You can leave,” he said. “But then who sits at the desk?”

The chair beneath me creaked softly, like it was answering for me.

I looked down at my hands.

They were stained with ink.

Fresh.

The figure faded into the hallway, and the lights hummed louder, settling into their familiar rhythm. The desk lamp steadied itself. The file slid neatly back into the drawer.

My watch ticked once.

2:18 a.m.

I exhaled, unsure how long I’d been holding my breath, and reached for a blank report form.

Just one more entry, I told myself.

Then I’d stand up.

1qqdps0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mr_Stranger_King/comments/1qqdps0/what_the_hotel_stay_is_like_during_a_hair/,What the Hotel Stay Is Like During a Hair Transplant in Turkey,"*This article reflects my personal experience as a patient who traveled to Turkey for a hair transplant, stayed in the clinic-arranged hotel, and documented the entire process.*

**What is the hotel stay like during a hair transplant in Turkey?**

The hotel stay during a hair transplant in Turkey is usually a standard 4- or 5-star business hotel adapted for medical tourism, including airport transfers, clinic transport, and recovery-friendly room setups for postprocedure patients.

Most clinics partner with hotels located within walking distance of their facilities. The accommodations are clean and comfortable, though not luxury resorts. The setup prioritizes convenience and recovery support over premium amenities. You'll typically stay 3-4 nights, covering arrival day, surgery day, post-operative wash, and departure.

The experience feels less like a vacation and more like a streamlined medical visit with hotel comfort.

Everything runs on a tight schedule designed to move international patients through efficiently.

# Why clinics include hotels in hair transplant packages

Including hotel accommodation in hair transplant packages solves multiple logistical challenges for both clinics and patients.

For clinics, coordinating accommodation ensures patients arrive rested and on time for procedures. They know exactly where you're staying and can schedule pickup precisely. This efficiency matters when clinics perform 15-20 procedures daily.

For patients traveling internationally, bundled accommodation eliminates the stress of finding suitable lodging near the clinic. You won't waste recovery time navigating an unfamiliar city or dealing with language barriers at check-in.

The medical tourism infrastructure in Istanbul has refined this system over thousands of procedures. Partner hotels understand post-surgery needs and work closely with clinics to accommodate patients wearing bandages, requiring early checkouts, or needing quiet environments.

Cost control is another factor. Clinics negotiate bulk rates with hotels, passing savings to patients while maintaining quality standards. This keeps package prices competitive without compromising patient comfort.

# What type of hotel do hair transplant patients usually stay in

Hair transplant patients typically stay in 4-star business hotels rather than tourist-focused accommodations.

My hotel was Naz City Taksim, located 150 meters from Acıbadem Hospital. The proximity was extremely convenient. I could walk to the clinic for my procedure and post-operative wash without needing transportation.

These hotels cater primarily to business travelers, which means they're clean, functional, and quiet. The rooms are standard. The breakfast buffets are excellent. The staff speaks English. But don't expect resort-style pools, spas, or beachfront views.

The emphasis is on location rather than luxury. Clinics choose hotels close to their facilities to minimize travel time for patients who may feel uncomfortable or self-conscious wearing bandages in public.

The quiet, professional atmosphere suits recovery better than bustling tourist hotels. You'll encounter other transplant patients in the lobby and at breakfast, creating a sense of shared experience rather than feeling isolated.

# What's included in the hotel stay (and what isn't)

**Included                                                                                      Not Included**

|Airport pickup|Room service extras|
|:-|:-|
|Daily breakfast|Alcohol|
|Clinic transfers|Tourist excursions|
|Late checkout (sometimes)|Evening meals|
|Basic WiFi|Medical care in hotel|
|Standard room amenities|Laundry service|

My package included 4 nights at the hotel with breakfast, but evening meals were my responsibility. This is standard across most clinics.

The breakfast buffet offered Turkish and continental options. Eggs, bread, cheese, olives, fruits, pastries, tea, and coffee. More than sufficient for starting your day before or after the procedure.

Evening meals require venturing out or ordering delivery. I spent £12-20 per dinner at nearby restaurants. Many patients use food delivery apps like Yemeksepeksi or GetirYemek.

Airport transfers work smoothly. A driver meets you at Istanbul Airport with a name sign, handles your luggage, and delivers you to the hotel. The same happens in reverse for departure.

The hotel provides towels and basic toiletries, but bring your own pillow if you have specific comfort requirements. The standard pillows work fine, but extra elevation helps with swelling during recovery.

# How the hotel is adapted for post-surgery recovery

Hotels partnering with hair transplant clinics make subtle adaptations for post-operative patients.

The most important consideration is sleeping position. You must sleep elevated for the first 3-5 nights to minimize swelling. I requested extra pillows at check-in, and the hotel provided three additional pillows without question. This let me create a comfortable elevated sleeping arrangement.

Housekeeping operates with awareness that transplant patients need rest. My room was serviced at predictable times, and I could request ""do not disturb"" for extended periods without issue.

Towel management becomes important post-surgery. You'll need to protect pillows from any bleeding or ointment transfer. I used the provided towels to cover my pillow, changing them daily. The hotel supplied fresh towels without complaint.

The bathrooms in these hotels typically have good lighting and mirrors, which helps when applying medications or checking your scalp during recovery.

Room temperature control matters more than you'd expect. You'll want a cool room at night since sleeping elevated with your head bandaged can make you warmer than usual. The air conditioning worked well in my room.

# What surprised me most about the hotel stay

The sheer number of other hair transplant patients surprised me most.

At breakfast on my second morning, I counted at least eight other men wearing bandages or showing obvious signs of recent procedures. Some had shaved donor areas clearly visible. Others wore caps or bandages similar to mine.

This created an unexpected sense of camaraderie. We'd nod at each other knowingly. A few conversations started naturally. Everyone understood what everyone else was going through.

The hotel staff showed zero reaction to rooms full of bandaged guests. They've seen thousands of transplant patients. This normalization felt reassuring rather than clinical.

The quiet atmosphere also struck me. Despite housing many guests, the hotel remained calm. No late-night noise. No disruptive neighbors. The environment genuinely supported recovery.

I was surprised by how close everything was. Walking 150 meters to the clinic felt manageable even the day after surgery. The donor area felt like mild sunburn, nothing more.

The breakfast buffer quality exceeded expectations. I'd assumed hospital-adjacent hotels would serve mediocre food, but the selection and quality were genuinely good.

**Is the hotel stay comfortable after surgery?**

Yes, but comfort depends on swelling, sleeping position, and pain management rather than hotel luxury.

The first night proved the most difficult. The local anesthesia had worn off completely. The donor area felt tender, like moderate sunburn. I took paracetamol and felt fine within an hour.

Sleeping elevated using extra pillows took adjustment. I'm a side sleeper normally, but post-surgery you must sleep on your back with your head elevated. This prevents swelling from migrating to your face.

I removed the headband the clinic provided on day two, which was a mistake. Some swelling appeared around my eyes by morning. I immediately put the headband back on and applied ice, which resolved the swelling within hours.

The room itself was comfortable. Clean sheets, functioning air conditioning, hot water in the shower. Standard hotel quality, nothing remarkable but nothing problematic.

The proximity to the clinic reduced stress significantly. Knowing I could walk to my post-operative wash appointment without organizing transportation made everything feel more manageable.

Noise sensitivity increased after the procedure. The Xanax I'd taken during surgery and general exhaustion made me sleep deeper than usual, but I appreciated the quiet environment when awake.

By night three, comfort improved dramatically. The scabs had formed. The soreness had faded. Sleeping elevated felt more natural. The headband came off permanently, and I slept normally.

**Should you upgrade or book your own hotel?**

For most patients, the clinic-provided hotel makes the most sense.

**Pros of using the clinic hotel:**

Zero logistical coordination required

Proven proximity to clinic

Staff familiar with transplant patients

Included in package price

Reliable quality standards

**Cons of using the clinic hotel:**

No choice in specific hotel features

Standard business hotel, not luxury

May share space with many other patients

Limited evening meal options nearby

**When upgrading might make sense:**

If you're extending your stay for tourism after recovery, booking a different hotel for those extra nights makes sense. Recover in the clinic hotel, then move to a more tourist-friendly location.

If you have specific accessibility needs or medical requirements beyond the procedure, discuss options with the clinic beforehand. They can usually accommodate requests or suggest alternatives.

If you're traveling with a companion who will need entertainment while you recover, a hotel with more amenities might justify the extra cost. But you'll need to coordinate your own transport to clinic appointments.

I used the clinic-provided hotel and felt completely satisfied. The convenience outweighed any desire for luxury amenities. I was there to recover, not vacation.

Booking your own hotel only makes sense if you know Istanbul well, have specific hotel loyalty programs you want to use, or need facilities the standard package doesn't provide.

# What I wish I knew before the hotel stay

**Bring button-up shirts or zip-up hoodies.** Pulling t-shirts over your head after surgery risks bumping your grafts. I wore the same button-up shirt for three days because it was the only one I'd packed. Pack at least two.

**The hotel is medical recovery, not leisure.** I initially thought I might do some sightseeing between appointments. The reality is you'll want to rest. The procedure is exhausting, and you'll look conspicuous with a bandaged head. Plan for a recovery trip, not a tourism trip.

**Evening meal planning matters.** The breakfast is excellent, but you'll need to figure out dinner. Research nearby restaurants before arrival or download food delivery apps. I wandered around looking for food my first evening, which was unnecessary stress.

**Request extra pillows immediately at check-in.** Don't wait until bedtime to realize you need elevation. Get the pillows set up before surgery so your sleeping area is ready when you return.

**The headband the clinic provides is crucial.** I thought it was optional cosmetic padding. It's not. It prevents swelling from migrating to your face. Wear it for the full recommended time even if it feels unnecessary.

**Other patients are your best resource.** The men I met at breakfast shared helpful tips about recovery, managing scabs, and what to expect. Don't hesitate to start conversations.

Several of these hotel-related lessons and other practical insights are covered in more detail in the Hair

Transplant Turkey Guide. I documented the complete experience, including planning mistakes I made, recovery challenges I didn't anticipate, and practical advice that would have saved me stress if I'd known it beforehand.

The hotel stay is simpler than most people fear, but having realistic expectations makes the experience significantly smoother.

I am admittedly feeling a bit frustrated trying to track down volunteering opportunities. It actually is beginning to feel impossible to get into… 

I’m a registered volunteer with the official City of Carrollton Public Services (library, parks & rec, animal services, etc) but EVERY slot is always filled… the only times ever available are in the middle of the workday. Weekend and evening slots are already booked up all the way to May! 

I am also a bit tired of “cattle call” style volunteering. I have volunteered a few times with MetroCrest, but I wasn’t a fan of the “sign up, show up, work, and leave” setup — I barely spoke to anybody my entire shift and was quite literally the only person volunteering solo. I love what they do, but my shifts just felt so mechanic and isolating. 

I really would like to volunteer or work with a group of people or organization who meets on a reoccurring basis and maybe do things like grab coffee afterwards. It would be great to have the opportunity to do good and actually get to know my community, rather than just crossing my fingers that I can grab a slot, working in silence, then leaving. I am not religious, so I would prefer to volunteer somewhere that doesn’t center that topic. And as mentioned, I would need a realistic volunteering schedule that works for somebody who has a M-F 8-5 job. 

Does something like this even exist or am I being unrealistic? How have you found community and connection while volunteering?",2,1769704960.0,CarrolltonTX,7,0.67,False

1qqdne3,https://i.redd.it/8sw6swq2hbgg1.png,"Married To a Killer CEO, I Left For Good!","Chapter 1



""Hand over the child, NOW!""



My blood froze as masked men stormed into the ICU, guns pointed at me and the medical staff.



My newborn son squirmed in my arms, his tiny face scrunched up against my chest. I clutched him tighter, my body curling protectively around his fragile form.



""I said hand him over!"" One of the men stepped forward, his voice muffled behind a black balaclava.



""Please,"" I begged, tears streaming down my face. ""He's just a baby—""



The sharp sting of a slap cut my words short. My head snapped sideways, vision blurring as rough hands tore my son from my grasp.



I lunged forward desperately, my hospital gown tangling around my legs.



""No! Please! Give him back to me!""



The nurses cowered against the wall. Where was security? Where was Kallus?



My husband should have been here hours ago when my water broke, but the CEO of Luma Corps was ""unavailable.""



Now, after hours of labor, after finally holding my beautiful boy in my arms, these monsters had appeared from nowhere.



What happened next will haunt me until my dying breath.



One of the men laid my son on the bed and grabbed a pillow. My scream tore through the room as he pressed it over my baby's face.



My baby's tiny limbs flailed against the white cotton, his movements growing weaker, until...they stopped.



""No! God, no!"" I thrashed against the hands holding me back, my throat raw from screaming.



The men laughed, as my world collapsed around me. Someone stepped toward me, the butt of a gun raised. Pain exploded across my temple as he slammed it against my head.



I didn't lose consciousness, though I wished I had. Instead, I lay still, eyes closed, as tears leaked from my eyes.



Suddenly, a phone chimed. A video call.



""Greetings, boss. I've done as you ordered.""



""Excellent work.""



That voice. That familiar, impossible voice.



Kallus?



The man moved the phone, presumably showing the horrific scene.



My husband's cool, controlled tone sliced through me like a blade. ""And Donna?""



""She's unconscious.""



""Perfect."" Kallus sounded pleased—pleased about the murder of his own child.



""Now all I have to do is gaslight her enough and she'll never be able to live without me.""



My heart shattered into a million pieces. The betrayal felt so overwhelming that I could barely process it.



The father of my child and my husband of 5 years had ordered his own son's murder.



Then another voice came through the phone. It was feminine, but very familiar.



""What are you doing, darling?""



I instantly realized the voice. It was Hannah. Hannah Jacobs. His secretary.



Why is she calling my husband 'Darling?'



""Just tying up loose ends, honey."" Kallus's voice softened in a way I'd rarely heard.



""I've kept my promise. I told you that our son will be the only heir to Luma Corps. I've killed that wretched cheap woman's child, for you.""



Our son? They had a child together? The room spun around me as I fought to remain still, and to keep my breathing shallow with my eyes closed.



Five years of marriage, and my husband was not only cheating but had started another family with his secretary.



""You're sure she doesn't suspect anything?"" Hannah asked, her voice dripping with concern that made me want to vomit.



""Yes, she doesn't."" He said.



""Poor girl,"" Kallus chuckled, the sound chilling my blood.



""She also doesn't even know I was the one who killed her parents.""



Kallus's words crashed into my world like a wrecking ball.



My parents' death—the car accident that had devastated me—had been him? All this time, I'd cried on his shoulder, accepted his comfort, while he...



I bit down on my tongue until I tasted blood. I couldn't make a single noise. They couldn't know I'd heard.



The men shuffled around the room, packing equipment, removing evidence. One lingered by my bedside, checking my pulse.



I maintained the shallow breathing of unconsciousness, though every nerve in my body screamed to fight.



""Let's go,"" one of them barked. ""She'll be out for hours.""



Their footsteps faded. The door closed. Still, I remained motionless, counting seconds that felt like hours.



The door opened again.



""Mrs. Luma?"" A trembling voice called out. It was the doctor.



I opened my eyes slowly, as if just regaining consciousness. The doctor approached my son, my beautiful baby boy who had only lived for mere minutes before being taken away.



I watched, hollow-eyed, as he checked for signs of life. His shoulders slumped, hands dropping to his sides in defeat.



""Doctor?"" My voice cracked, though I already knew the answer.



He turned to me, his face was gray with shock and grief. ""I'm so sorry, Mrs. Luma. Your child is... he's gone.""



The dam broke. Tears erupted from somewhere deep inside me. I screamed until my throat burned, clutching at the sheets and punching the bed.



Two nurses rushed in, trying to calm me, holding my shoulders as I thrashed.



""Why? WHY?"" I screamed at the ceiling at the universe that had allowed this to happen. ""My baby... my sweet baby...""



One of the nurses pressed a tissue into my hand. ""Do you want us to call your husband?""



The mention of Kallus sent a bolt of pure hatred through me. It cleared my mind like lightning through fog.



""NO. My phone,"" I rasped. ""I need my phone.""



The younger nurse hesitated, then retrieved it from my belongings. My fingers trembled as I scrolled through contacts, past the K for Kallus, down to a name I hadn't touched in years.



Agnes Shaux. My brother.



We'd fallen out after I married Kallus. Agnes had never trusted him, he always used to say there was something off about the way he looked at me.



God, if only I'd listened.



The phone rang three times before his gruff voice answered.



""Donna?""



Just hearing him say my name broke something in me. But I controlled my tears.



""Agnes, I want to destroy Kallus. I want payback, I want revenge, Agnes!""



Silence stretched between us, broken only by my angry breathing.



Then, low and deadly, he asked ""What happened Donna?""



""He murdered my son for his mistress."" I replied, controlling the dam that was ready to burst.



Agnes seemed to be processing what she said, he then soon broke the silence with a deadly voice, ""Are you safe Donna?""



""Yes,"" I managed. ""For now. He doesn't know I heard him. He plans to manipulate me... I'm safe for the moment.""



""Wait for me."" His voice hardened with resolve.



""Agnes, I want to ruin his life, completely. I want to watch him beg and cry for mercy, I want him to regret everything he has done to me and my baby."" I breathed heavy as I spat out my words.



""You'll have it Donna, I promise you."" Agnes said, his voice dropping dangerously low.



""I'll be there in two weeks, but I'm sending someone—a bodyguard who can protect you. He'll arrive in a week. Hold on till then Donna, after that, you'll have your sweet revenge.""



The line then soon went dead.







Chapter 2



I stared out the hospital window that night, watching the stars blink coldly back at me.



No calls. No texts. Not even a courtesy visit from my husband after our child had been murdered.



Kallus was probably tucked away with Hannah, playing happy family with their son while mine lay cold in the hospital morgue.



My fingers clutched the thin hospital blanket.



The emptiness inside me threatened to swallow me whole.



For a moment, I thought about how easy it would be to just... end it all. To escape this nightmare.



But no.



My baby deserved justice. If I died now, his murder would go unpunished. Kallus would win. I couldn't let that happen.



…



I watched the sky lighten from black to blue as morning arrived.



The door opened, and the doctor who had pronounced my son dead walked in, clipboard in hand.



""Mrs. Luma, how are you feeling this morning?""



""I want to leave.""



He blinked, caught off guard. ""I'd recommend at least two more days of rest and observation. The trauma you've experienced—""



I was already swinging my legs over the side of the bed. ""I watched my son get murdered in front of me, doctor. Dealing with physical pain is easier than that.""



""Mrs. Luma, please—""



""I'm leaving. Get me the discharge papers.""



Twenty minutes later, I stood outside the hospital entrance in clothes a nurse had helped me find.



My body ached, but I ignored it. I pulled out my phone and scrolled through my contacts until I found the number of Patricia Goldman, a lawyer I'd met at one of Kallus's corporate functions.



She answered on the third ring.



""Patricia, it's Donna Shaux. I need to file for divorce.""



""Donna? I—this is unexpected. Are you sure—""



""I also want to file murder charges against my husband.""



Silence stretched across the line.



""Murder?"" Her voice dropped to a whisper.



""My newborn son was killed yesterday on Kallus's orders. I have no physical evidence yet, but I will get it. I heard him confess on a video call.""



""Donna, these are extremely serious allegations—""



""I'll send you everything I gather in the next few days. Can you prepare the paperwork?""



Patricia's professional composure returned. ""Of course. Once you send the evidence copies, I'll file everything immediately.""



""Thank you.""



I ended the call just as a sleek black car with tinted windows pulled up to the curb in front of me.



My stomach twisted as the driver's door opened and Kallus stepped out, a bouquet of white roses in his hand, his face arranged in an expression of grief.



Fake. Everything about him was fake.



He strode toward me, arms outstretched for a hug. I stepped back.



""Don't touch me. I'm still in pain.""



He lowered his arms, his eyes narrowing for a split second before the concerned mask slipped back into place.



""I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you, darling. I got caught up with... work matters. The news about our son... I can't believe it."" He reached for my hand.



""I promise I'll find the men who did this and make them pay.""



I stared at him, keeping my face carefully blank.



The audacity of this monster, pretending to grieve for the child HE ordered to be killed.



""Okay.""



My simple response threw him off. He stuttered slightly, then cleared his throat.



""Let's get you home. The car's waiting.""



He guided me toward the vehicle, opening the back door rather than the passenger side where he usually wanted me to sit.



As I slid inside, I froze.



Hannah sat in the front passenger seat, her blonde hair perfectly styled, makeup flawless, not a hint of sleep deprivation or grief on her face.



""Hi, Donna."" Her voice dripped with fake sympathy. ""I'm so sorry for your loss.""



I said nothing, turning to Kallus as he settled into the driver's seat.



""What is she doing here?""



Kallus glanced at me in the rearview mirror. ""About that. Hannah will be moving in with us from now on. She's offered to help look after you while you recover.""



I stared at them both, amazed by their audacity. They killed my child to protect their secret relationship, and now they were bringing it right into my home?



""No thanks. It's not necessary. She doesn't have to bother herself.""



Hannah turned in her seat, her face a mask of concern. ""But I care about you, Donna. I want to help.""



Something snapped inside me. The image of my baby's tiny limbs going still flashed before my eyes.



""I don't care about that cheap woman! Go fuck yourself!""



The car went silent. Then Kallus's face transformed, his carefully cultivated mask falling away to reveal the monster beneath.



""Who said what you say matters?"" he roared, slamming his hand against the steering wheel. ""I call the shots here, and don't you dare shout at Hannah!""



I shrank back against the seat, genuinely shocked.



In five years of marriage, he'd never raised his voice at me like this—and certainly never in defense of another woman.



""She will be moving in, and that's final,"" he continued, his voice cold and controlled now.



""You're mentally unwell. I will not be taking your opinion into account.""



Mentally unwell? After watching my child murdered on his orders?



Hannah caught my eye in the rear view mirror and smiled, it was a small, victorious smile that enraged me even more.



""You will listen to me, and only me,"" Kallus said, starting the engine. ""You have no one else to go to, Donna. You couldn't protect our son. You can't even protect yourself. You're better off doing what I say.""



I nodded meekly, lowering my eyes. ""Yes, Kallus.""



As the car pulled away from the hospital, I slipped my phone from my pocket and carefully, without drawing attention, snapped a photo of what I could see from my angle..



Kallus's hand resting possessively on Hannah's thigh.



Evidence.



This was going to be the first piece in the case I would build to destroy him.







Chapter 3



The rest of the car ride passed in tense silence.



Hannah kept glancing back at me with that fake smile plastered on her face while Kallus drove with one hand, the other still possessively resting on her thigh.



We pulled up to our mansion, no, his mansion now. I refused to think of it as my home anymore.



Kallus opened my door. ""Let me help you.""



I flinched away from his touch. ""I can manage.""



My body still ached from childbirth, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the hollow ache in my chest.



Once inside, Hannah immediately made herself at home, tossing her designer purse onto the entryway table like she'd done it a thousand times before.



""I'm going to rest,"" I said, turning toward the staircase. ""I have a headache.""



Kallus exchanged a look with Hannah. ""Good idea. Hannah, show her to the guest room.""



I stopped mid-step. ""Guest room?""



""Yes, guest room."" His tone was casual, as if this were perfectly normal.



""The bedroom is a bit messy now... due to some things. But you should rest up in the guest room for the while.""



""I can go by myself."" My voice sounded hollow even to my own ears.



Kallus's jaw tightened. ""All you have to do is listen to me and act accordingly, no more talking back.""



A broken laugh escaped me. ""Fine.""



Hannah placed a gentle hand on my back, guiding me toward the stairs. I fought the urge to shove her away.



As we passed the master bedroom, my eyes caught the scene through the slightly ajar door.



I caught a glimpse of lace panties on the floor, and the bed sheets crumpled and untidy.



Hannah noticed my gaze and urged me forward. ""This way.""



""So this is what was going on, huh?"" The words slipped out before I could stop them.



Her caring mask didn't slip. ""I don't know what you're talking about.""



I looked at her.



This woman who'd slept with my husband for God knows how long. The sheer audacity took my breath away.



I chuckled. ""Yeah. Of course.""



Hannah shrugged and opened the door to the guest room. It was plain, just a bed, a table, a lamp. Nothing else. Like a prison cell.



I sat on the edge of the bed, my legs suddenly too weak to hold me.



""I'll get you some water,"" Hannah said, disappearing down the hall.



She returned moments later with a glass. I took it without hesitation. It was just water—how could it hurt?



As soon as I finished, a wave of dizziness washed over me. My vision blurred at the edges.



Something was wrong. Water wasn't supposed to do this.



As darkness closed in, the last thing I saw was Hannah's smile—no longer fake, but evil and cruel.



...



""Mama, mama.""



I drifted in the middle of an endless ocean, weightless and lost.



A tiny hand reached up through the water, grasping for air. It was my baby, drowning, calling for me.



My body wouldn't move.



Heavy chains bound me to a bed floating in the middle of the ocean.



I strained against them, muscles screaming, until finally—with one desperate surge of strength—I broke free.



I dove into the water—



And woke up gasping, sweat soaking my clothes, and my chest heaving with sobs.



It was just a nightmare.



I clutched my head as tears streamed down my face. ""I miss you, baby,"" I whispered. ""I'm so sorry.""



A sound from down the hall cut through my grief.



The sounds of men and women breathing mingled together.



The realisation hit me like ice water. They'd drugged me. They'd drugged me so they could love while I was unconscious in the next room.



Rage propelled me from the bed. I grabbed my phone and crept down the hallway silently.



Their door was ajar. Through the gap, I saw them—Hannah riding Kallus, her head thrown back in ecstasy.



""God, yes, Hannah,"" Kallus groaned, his hands gripping her hips.



I bit down on my hand to keep from screaming, the pain grounding me as I hit record on my phone. The betrayal burned like acid, but the evidence would be worth it.



I filmed for a minute before returning to my room, saving the video and staring at the ceiling until morning came.



Their groans eventually came to an end, but I still couldn't sleep.



…



The next morning, I freshened up and headed to the kitchen.



Hannah was already there, whisking eggs in a bowl while Kallus sat at the island, newspaper in hand.



""Good morning,"" I said, my voice carefully neutral.



Hannah smiled. ""I'm making cheese omelets—Kallus's favorite.""



""I'll just have toast."" I reached for the bread.



""Don't be silly,"" Hannah said. ""You need proper nutrition after... everything.""



""I said I want toast.""



Kallus lowered his newspaper. ""Hannah's making breakfast for everyone. Be grateful.""



""I don't want her food.""



""What's that supposed to mean?"" Hannah's eyes narrowed.



""Nothing."" I turned to the toaster. ""I just want toast.""



""You're being rude to Hannah,"" Kallus said, his voice dangerously quiet.



I spun around. ""Rude? To the woman who's taken over my house? My husband?""



""Apologize to her,"" Kallus demanded. ""Now.""



""No."" I tried to walk past him, but he grabbed my arm, his fingers digging into my flesh.



Then suddenly, a slap came out of nowhere, a sharp crack that snapped my head to the side.



""Apologize!"" Kallus's face was inches from mine, contorted with rage.



I stared at him, stunned.



In five years of marriage, he'd never raised a hand to me. Never. But for her, he'd crossed that line without hesitation.



Hannah played her part perfectly. ""Kallus, don't be rash to your wife for me.""



The act made me want to vomit.



""I'm sorry,"" I whispered as I complied for the moment, my cheek stinging.



I'd make them pay for this.



Every. Single. Humiliation.



I'll make them pay.



…



Night fell, and Hannah brought me water again. I pretended to drink, then dumped it down the sink when she left.



I waited, listening for their usual routine.



When I was certain they'd finished their nightly activities, I crept to their room.



Hannah lay and asleep, her blonde hair spread across the pillow. The shower ran in the attached bathroom.



I snapped a quick photo of Hannah, then spotted Kallus's phone on the nightstand.



His password hadn't changed—my birthday. The irony made me roll my eyes.



My hands trembled as I opened his messages with Hannah.



There it was—evidence of their affair, discussions of my baby's murder, plans for their future.



I bit down on my hand again, drawing blood as I suppressed a sob.



Quickly, I forwarded key messages to my email, then deleted the evidence from his sent folder.



Suddenly, the shower stopped.



I carefully replaced the phone and slipped out, heart hammering.



But I had surely collected key evidence.



…



Days passed in this new, twisted reality.



Kallus barely acknowledged my existence except to bark orders, while giving all attention to Hannah.



When I was around, they'd put on their little show, discussing about caring for me with fake concern.



Then one evening, as I lay in my room pretending to be sedated, I heard Hannah's voice from downstairs. She was on the phone, her tone relaxed and cheerful.



I crept to the staircase and listened.



""...got rid of that cheap woman Donna's baby, and now our little Kingsley will have an amazing life in this place."" Hannah's voice drifted up. ""We'll kick Donna out soon, then you can move in with us, Mom. It'll be perfect.""



My heart shattered all over again. Kingsley. Their son had a name.



He had a life, a future. Everything my baby should've had, stolen by my husband and his mistress.



I watched as Hannah set her phone down and headed to the kitchen. The phone sat on the coffee table, unlocked and unattended.



This was it. A massive risk, but potentially my most valuable evidence yet.



I moved silently down the stairs and grabbed her phone.

I’m trying to lose weight and stay consistent, but I’m a bit confused and could use some advice.
I have two big family parties coming up on Monday and Tuesday, where it’ll be hard to avoid eating normally. Because of that, I was thinking of fasting on the Saturday before (only black coffee and water).
My confusion is mainly about calories.
If weight loss comes down to calories, would it be okay to only eat at the parties and keep the rest of the day very light or skip meals? Or does that usually lead to overeating or other issues?
I don’t want to binge or feel unwell, but I also don’t want to undo my progress.
What’s a realistic and healthier way to handle situations like this?",1,1769704785.0,WeightLossAdvice,3,1.0,False
