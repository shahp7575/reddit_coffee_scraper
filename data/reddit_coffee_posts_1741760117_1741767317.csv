1j9f0su,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j9f0su/gf_23_f_smoked_a_cigarette_after_promising_me_25/,GF (23 F) smoked a cigarette after promising me (25 F) she wouldn’t,"Some background, me (25F) and my gf (23F) have been dating for a lil over a year now. For the most part, we’ve had a really good, loving relationship. She’s truly an amazing partner who would never do anything to intentionally hurt me. 

I unfortunately have pretty bad daddy issues to put it simply. My dad was a raging alcoholic with very bad anger issues and questionable morals. Always drunk, always cheating on my mother, always physically and emotionally abusing my mother and sometimes my brother and I, and always telling my family he’d quit drinking yet always break that promise. At one point, my mom turned to smoking cigarettes to try to cope with all the stress my dad brought to our family. She no longer smokes but it took her awhile to completely stop. 

Because of my dad, I have had a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol primarily, but also cigs and really just any substance abuse. As a kid, I vowed to never drink or smoke. However, college happened and I dabbled in some social drinking. Since I didn’t get addicted like i was scared i would as a child, i decided, okay I’ll be a social drinker moving forward. Cigs however I never have tried and don’t plan to.  

When I first met my gf, she also identified as a social drinker and social cig smoker. At that time, I was okay with dating social drinkers bc I too was one. Her smoking cigs I felt iffy about bc she was previously addicted to vapes/nicotine for like 6 years. At the time we met, I think she was a lil over a year clean from nicotine. But she reassured me she truly does have a handle on her occasional usage now and wouldn’t ever become addicted again, so, I kinda just shrugged it off. Until I noticed she started smoking more days a week with her friends. I brought up my concern of her smoking again, and also confided in her about my mom’s usage and how that affected me. This time, she thanked me for opening up about that, and on her own behalf, promised she wouldn’t smoke any more cigs moving forward as she didn’t find much pros to outweigh the cons.

Fast forward to just a few months ago, I was hanging with my gf. She asked me to get something from her bag. As I was searching for it, I come across some
Zyns - nicotine pouches. I broke down as it reminded me of times I’d accidentally find my moms secret stash of cigs or dads secret stash of alc, even though they promises they also wouldn’t go back to their substance. She felt really bad and said it was a freebie from a friend and that she probably wasn’t going to use them anyways. She again, reassured me she wouldn’t use nicotine again moving forward. 

Now to today. My gf and I came back from a lil double date vacation. It was me, my gf, and her friend and her friend’s bf. All was going amazing until the 4th and final day of the trip. We were all packing and cleaning, getting ready to check out the Airbnb. I finish up and decide to go find my gf to just hang out. I find her outside with her friend, who is holding a cig in her hand. After about less than a minute of me going outside, my gf says she’s gonna go make coffee. I felt awkward being outside with the other couple so I too went back into the Airbnb to chill in our room. she wasn’t in the kitchen making coffee, instead she went the bathroom. Okay, cool nothing out of the ordinary. However, our bedroom is right next to the bathroom and walls are pretty thin. As I was resting on the bed waiting for her to come out and hang, I hear her brushing her teeth even though she just brushed them like 30 minutes ago. I also heard her spray perfume.

I ain’t gonna lie, I started spiraling. I assumed she smoked cigs with her friends and was trying to hide it given how quick she was to leave after I came outside and her trying to mask the smell. Again, It reminded of when my mom or dad would hide their stash after telling me they were done for good. 

Later that day, when we were back home, I asked if she ended up smoking that morning. She said yes, but that it was only one hit. Again, I spiraled. I immediately started crying because she broke her promise she made to me about not smoking nicotine/cigs again. I just felt so betrayed and hurt that she went back on her promise. It didn’t even have to do with how little or much she smoked. It was simply the principle of her breaking her promise that she put for herself and me.

I told her since the beginning of our relationship that I do not play about substance abuse! Not to say she’s abusing nicotine or other substances rn, but that if someone promises not to use them, I take that promise very seriously. 

Her smoking that morning, even if it was just one hit, made me feel so hurt, so betrayed. When I told her this, she said she didn’t think it would hurt me because one hit was “nothing”. But for me, it’s about the principle of making a promise but then not keeping it. This situation just made me feel like a lil scared hopeless girl again begging her dad to please stop drinking for his and our family’s sake. 

My initial instinct was to end the relationship because I made it real clear that I took these kinds of promises very seriously, but I also understood I was very emotional in that moment when I first found out. However, I still am feeling hurt and betrayed. I need some unbiased advice on how to proceed, if at all. Is this forgivable? Redeemable? 

Tl;dr: I have bad history with cigs and general substance abuse. Gf promised she’d never smoke cigs or use nicotine again. However, today she smoke with a friend  and tried masking the proof of it (the smell) to me. I told her it made me feel betrayed but she didn’t think one puff would be a big deal. Is this breakup worthy? Is she trustworthy?

1j9f01u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Northeastindia/comments/1j9f01u/stuff_i_found_about_arunachal/,Stuff I found about arunachal linguistics(Specifically Tanis'),"So, here's a brief introduction to my reasearch and about myself, you can call me Horu(nickname given to me by my parents) and I'm a going-to-be highschool senior this year, additionally I've been studying the linguistics of aruanchal, specifically Tani, for almost 2 years by conducting reasearches and talking with elderies around the villages myself cause I believe the truth is better to found by yourself.

After spending half of my year dedicated to learning the recipe of the Tani languages, I've finally figured out the key ingredient, the syntax(hehe cool linguist term, aka structure of the language).

Hi, my name's horu and before I start; I want to mention that I will mostly used galo for examples as I have most of the refrence plus knowledge about it, now let's begin with the base now;

P.s read the è as a schwa and í as eu from hangeul as it is the most similiar sound I could give you the refrence for.

# The Structure

The structure of arunachalee dialects, especially tani languages, uses structure of ‘Topic-Comment’ and it makes sense as it shares roots with Tibetan language, while hindi is not so rigid with it. 

This is one of the main reasons why the new generation who has been in more influences or in touch with hindi, find it awkward or even hard to grasp the structure's ‘where and why did it come here’.

Let me give you an example,

Ikki wè ikki be rub hido

Ikki wè ikki — Dogs are dogs 
Be rub hido — will do what they do

This phrases emphasis the idea that dogs will act according to their behaviour(unrelated but I've seen several girls use it for their exs in hostel)

Now let's try recreating an hindi sentence for this,

Kutte to kutte ke hi kaam karenge

Kutte to kutte — Dogs will be dogs

Ke hi kaam karenge — will do what they do

A similar translations to the phrase ahead,
They both sound almost similiar right and difference? Well, yes they have similarities but; hindi follows
 (Subject+emphasis)—(Object)—(Verb)

Meanwhile, the example phrase from galo follows
 (Topic emphasized+subject)—(actions to be done by the said topic ""dogs"" + object)—(verb)

Thought the same SOV structure, they still possess  that difference which makes learning each other a bit awkward.

And counting in arunachali language is whole lot different than hindi, hindi follows same counting for mostly everything while the Tani languages have specifiers.

Let me demonstrate,

Hindi
Ek kitaab — One book

Galo
Dapken go hengè/kitbe — one book

Dap is numericals specifier for books, and books only. Let's try another,

Teen kutte — Three dogs

Dorken go ikki — Three dogs

Again, you guessed it, Dor is specifier for animals who walk on paw (birds and fishes have different specifier)

Even vegetables, vehicals, plants etc are not exempted from this, but mentioning them all will take additional time of your attention so let's head to the next part.

# Grammar and syllables + pronounciation

Grammatically, most tani languages are very Topic-comment rigid, and not following it makes the sentence sound awefully awkward that even natives go ""huh?"".

That's why most village folks can easily spot a person who's been in a influence with hindi more than their native language.

Thats why there's a common joke around the villagers that city people can only say ""Kè"" in their language, and yes, sadly it is indeed true.
Some folks even say they sound like chicken cause they repeat kè as if it's a whole sentence itself (Kon kon is a children vocabulary for chickens sounds and it is pronounced similar to kè).

How a city-raised tribal usually speaks—

No ka paas Paisa he kya? Nai he? Kè, hojaiga tabto, kè kè kè

It's a very typical sentence formed by a  aruanchalee, but new generation arunachalees are getting better, at english and partially hindi, rather than their mother tongue.

Kè is almost like a subsitute for hindi's ""hojai ga"" but not fully the same, it also works as a simple okay to a request or order and even as a bidding good bye, it's very context based.

—
In matter is syllables, hindi is far more diverse and has an extensive library of sounds, while Tani has far less syllables used than hindi and not as playfully with words, But Tani languages compensate that by having Tonal syllables, that's why there are several words that sound the same and have complete different meaning.

Anyi — Anyi
Sister — 2

The yi is a swinging/floating sound and is very commonly used in tani languages, the yi in sister goes up in the pitch while the yi in the  2 stays flat.
There's also another, anyi/anni(meaning a little in amount), this one is pronounced by elongating the yi syllable.

While hindi also have their sounds which sound exactly the same with the difference of tongue placement, I must confess, hindi really is a very diverse language on the basis on phonology.

°Cases with pronounciation

In Arunachal, common mispronounciation of L as R is evident and widespread, even I myself unknowingly pronounce ""Lamba rasta"" as ""ramba rasta"", though the r is pronounced very lightly in cases as this.

Decades of influences and exchanges with assam has led to a strange case, arunachalees have tendencies to pronounce ""a"" (a schwa of hindi) as O but more rounded, and that's why there was a meme phrase surfacing in Arunachal that occured as ""Gorom hai, Gorom hai"" the hindi's garam is mispronounced as gorom, which quite comical and funny in my opinion(I know my humour smells like fish market).

Additionally, I've observed that arunachalees have very hard time pronouncing hindi words correct, tribals naturally didn't have any aspirated words so they subsitute the aspirations with tensed/high pitched syllables for hindi words, I've yet to meet an aruanchlee in Arunachal who pronounces khana with aspirations, and not just KAna.

And tribals, especially younglings mispronounces M as T, and my sister was also a victim of this, she pronounced Moyi(younger sister your mother) as Toyi.

Another, N as D, I was so fricking confused when my mother kept repeating to me in the accent ""Do Achin dotbaye"", this is more prevalent when the speaker raps instead of speaking.

Other cases, such as fricative sounds, one where your upper teeth placement is on the lips, does'nt appear in tani languages.

The ""F"" and ""V"" nowadays are subsituted with the swinging syllable ""Yi"" to substitute their hissing sound. Pyi, is pronounced like a mix of Hi and pi, like puhi  without pursuing the lips while forming an ""oo"" shape on the lips.
Same with V but as Byi.

Presently, you might have noticed my name ""Kkopyi""(it means coffee), well, a fun fact, Tani languages don't have the ""Au"" and they subsitute it with elongated Oo. But kko instead of koo? Another fun fact, I'm also working on a script(I realised the old one lacked efficiency and needed further development, I sucked xD) and will explain that in the right time, please bear with me.

I'm sure some tribals are wondering why I used wè and not è? Well, it's because I noticed that when the è is spoken after a vowel, it leaves out a soft ""u"" sound before ""è"",
But the è mixes with the word if it ends in consonant.
V—
Ikki wè

C—
Nokkè



Well, I didn't envisaged my this post to be this long but I suppose I was too invested?
Let's head to the end.
In my conclusion, Tani language shares some words with hindi due to connections and SOV structure with hindi as most asian languages do, though they still differ by a lot.
The syntax of the language of both of them are different, Tani languages are topic—comment rigid, while hindi is not, and They require a lot of information and specifies for a sentence while hindi is quite ambiguous with themselves, which is why it is such a comfortable language to speak but Tani languages are fricking hard with one wronge usuage of marker or specifier and your sentence either sounds stupid and childish or doesn't make sense at all.

If you wish to learn Tani languages, I suggest you not to search on internet as they will just teach you vocabularies, and will be in vain just as a ingredients is without any recipes. If you're simply satisfied with devouring the ingredients, then so be it, do what you do!:)

My suggestion, either go in arunachal and stay with the locals(NOT WITH THE CITY PEOPLE, THEY WILL JUST MAKE YOUR HINDI BROKEN PLZ TRUST ME)  or learn korean, chinese or Tibetan.

But personally, korean is the best choice if you're tryna learn Tani languages as nyishi, galo, tagin, adi etc, as they share almost alike/similiar grammatical structure,

Neo — no (you)
Neon — Nom (marks ""you"" as the topic)
Jinjja —Jijja (really)
Gidae — Mìmae (expectation)
Uyu — Udu (milk, though udu is a children vocabulary, it's still vastly used by adults for some reasons)
Ai — Au (Child, siblings, kidling)
Ijje — Ijja ( Now)
Kka — ka (question marker placed at the end)
Neun/eun — èm/m  and wè/è (both works the similiarly but èm and wè has slight differences on their usage)
Ga — Bè (also works the same but the bè also changes according to the context)
Reul — èm/m(almost similar with both   indicating what the verb is acting upon)

These are mostly galo, but yea, if you're familiar with korean, you already get a head start and that's great!:D

Until next time, bye guys! Please leave your opinions and comments! I'm really into knowing what your opinions are :)))
Also, any other tribes from Arunachal, if you could, please share the extension of your own language/dialect here! My work would feel so much more precious with y'all's inputs!

For example, this is an excerpt from one of my favorite comedy writers' fic:

\[In general, the target demographic for these kinds of novels are predominantly female, so it only makes sense to make the male lead essentially perfect in every way and only add superficial weaknesses such as an irrational dislike of sweets, an addiction to coffee, or a complete lack of communication skills that lends itself very well to the sorts of misunderstandings that can easily pad out a 50-chapter novel into hundreds and hundreds of chapters of the main couple breaking up and getting back together again.\]

And this is an excerpt from one of my fics, which felt like I was trying too hard to sound funny:

\[Before A can realize it, B has already picked him up bridal style and carried him out of the bar in front of everyone’s incredulous stares. He can only yell back to C to please keep an eye on B’s car, if he even used it to come here, before the crazy bastard runs off with A still in his arms like a sack of potatoes.

But, of course, all that alcohol won’t help anyone with keeping balance, and B slumps down, making A fall face-first to the ground with zero dignity in the process.\]

I have personally applied some tips, such as not making it too obvious that this part is meant to make readers laugh, not making characters react too exaggeratedly, etc. but I'm still not satisfied with my humor-writing skills.

It’s an even worse feeling when you have looked everywhere but have no idea what could be watching you

It’s a feeling that many people have experienced in their life and if you haven’t then count yourself as one of the lucky few.

Ever since I was young I’ve felt like I was being watched. Not all the time, usually when I was laying in bed late at night. I would turn my phone flashlight on and do sweep of the room
But there was never anything there

I’ve lived in a few different houses growing up, my parents liked to move around and in every house I’ve had this feeling. But I’ve always chalked it up to just anxiety or an over active imagination

But recently it’s been feeling, different

I just moved out and into my own house and am now living alone.

It’s been taking some getting used to, now knowing there is no one else in the house with me. But I liked it. The privacy was nice and I was able to stay up as late as I wanted

I have always had trouble sleeping, partly because of that feeling I mentioned earlier and also just having plain insomnia so I tend to stay up late.

Lately though, I haven’t been able to sleep for more than a few hours

I just lay in bed, and listen

I never hear anything

I never see anything

But I feel it

Even if you can’t tell is something’s there, you just know
There’s some instinct that tells us there’s danger

I usually fall asleep around 3 am
Still sitting up with my phone in hand
Battery dead from constantly turning on and off the flashlight 

I work from home so I usually just get straight to work on my computer fueled by a dangerous amount of coffee 

After a bit of working I hear this weird noise
It’s quiet but I could still hear it while wearing my headphones. It sounded almost like a scratching, but really small like someone using a sewing needle to carve letters into a wooden table.

I turned around and the sound stopped, I looked around and I couldn’t find anything. I chalked it up to just the old apartment making sounds. 

I went to bed late that night, or early I guess. Around like 4 am. I did my usual routine of checking my room crawling into bed and then using my phone flashlight to scan around the room

There are some night where I wonder if I actually still feel like I’m being watched or if it’s just a compulsion that I feel I need to do

Either way I did that for about and hour and finally felt myself falling asleep
But then I heard it again 

That scratching sound

It was a little louder now, but with the same cadence and rhythm

Scratch, scratch, scratch

I quickly grabbed my phone and looked around

It stopped

Nothing seemed different in my room

I turned the light off and it started again 

Light on, sound stop, light off, it starts again 

All night long, until eventually at some point I passed out

When I woke up the next morning I scanned my room, everything seemed the same

I could’ve find anything, until I looked at the wall facing my bed

There was a tiny hole. The size that you would make to hang up a picture a few feet from the ground.

I looked at it and tried to shine my light to see if there was anything behind it. But the hole was to small to even look though

Termites was what I figured, I decided I would call the exterminator in the morning.

I didn’t here the scratching at all that day
I spent most of it just playing games and trying to relax after last night

That night i heard it again, it started as soon as I hopped in bed, the feeling of being watched also felt worse

Every time I turned my flashlight on the sound would stop, I would glance at the small hole hopping to see a termite crawl out

But nothing, just another restless night 
Until I passed out in the early hours of the morning.

What I awoke to shook me to my core, it was the most gut wrenching feeling

When I looked at the hole it had gotten bigger and what was in it was an eye staring back at me


I didn’t know what to do, “who are you” I demanded at the eye

But it just stared back at me
It looked to be almost frozen in place 
It didn’t move or blink
It just watched me in silence 


“Why are you watching me” I screamed at it
But I got no response

After a moment of silence I decided to go to the kitchen and grab a knife with full intention to stab the eye that was stalking me.

But when I came back it wasn’t there, there was just a small quarter sized whole in my wall

I called the cops right after that, they came pretty quickly and the whole time waiting I just sat on my bed, staring at the hole

The police did a sweep of my room and the rest of the house. And found nothing

They also said there were no holes anywhere else in the house and even if there were the walls are far to thin for any person to hide in them.

They  just told me to get some sleep, that I looked exhausted 

I stayed up all night that night, and the next and the next. Staring at it.

Nothing, no scratching no eye. Somehow I knew I just needed to keep watching it. Every time I would look away or go in the other room. I could hear it. Slowly chipping away at my wall. Creeping closer.

This went on for a few days, in that time the hole had only grew about a centimeter in diameter. 

But that night I couldn’t stay awake, it had been close to a 3 days without sleep and there is only so much coffee and Red Bull can do


I passed out, I hadn’t slept for over 50 hours and was exhausted. My body couldn’t take any more. When I woke up it was the middle of the night. I was mortified

The hole had grown to over the size of a football. But I could see anything inside and there was no scratching to be heard

I reached for my phone to do my scan

And what I saw In the corner of my room still haunts me

It was a man, if you could even call it that

It was so pale and gaunt, you could see each rib and its skin looked shrink wrapped to the bones

Its teeth were a grotesque black and yellow and affixed into an abhorrent smile 

It just stood in the corner, and watched. Unblinking without a sound.

I didn’t know what to do, I was petrified with fear 
But I knew I couldn’t stay 
I had to get out of there

After a few seconds of my motionless state  I ran
I ran faster and harder then I had ever ran before 
Fueled by the most overwhelming feeling of terror ever in my life

In a blind panic I went straight for my car and drove, all I wanted to do was get as far away from that house and that thing that I possibly could. After about a half hour of driving I calmed down and called the police 

The police investigated the house and nearby area and could find anything.

I was able to get all my stuff out of the house, but every time I passed by that hole I felt a shiver go down my spine

But at the same time, I heard no sounds and for the first time in years. I didn’t feel like I was being watched 

I moved back in with my parents, they were kind enough to let me stay with them until I sell the house

And it’s been a few weeks, and I’ve felt safe.
But last night I felt it again 
That terrible feeling 
And when I went to bed

## The Science Behind White Noise: Why Does it Work for Sleep?

Before diving into product reviews, let's understand why white noise works so effectively for sleep. White noise is a consistent, static-like sound that contains all frequencies at equal intensity. Think of it as the auditory equivalent of white light, which contains all colors of the spectrum.

Here's how it benefits sleep:

*   **Sound Masking:** This is the primary mechanism. White noise effectively masks other distracting sounds,like traffic noise,snoring,or barking dogs. By creating a consistent background sound, it prevents these sudden noises from jarring you awake or interfering with your ability to fall asleep. Imagine trying to read a book in a busy coffee shop versus in a quiet library. The library allows for better concentration because external distractions are minimized. A white noise generator for sleep functions similarly.
*   **Relaxation:** The consistent and predictable nature of white noise can be calming and relaxing. It creates a sense of auditory security, which can help reduce anxiety and promote a sense of well-being, conducive to falling asleep. The steady hum of white noise signals a safe and consistent environment to the brain.*   **Habituation:** Over time, your brain learns to ignore white noise, making it less noticeable. This is a crucial benefit, as it allows you to fall asleep and stay asleep without being overly conscious of the sound itself.This helps in promoting white noise relaxing sleep.
*   **Tinnitus Relief:** For individuals with tinnitus, white noise can provide relief by masking the ringing or buzzing sounds in their ears. It doesn't cure tinnitus, but it can significantly reduce its impact on sleep and daily life. This can be achieved by using a white noise speaker for sleep.
*   **Mimicking In-Utero Sounds for Babies:** Babies are accustomed to the constant sounds of the womb.White noise mimics these sounds, creating a familiar and comforting environment that promotes sleep. That's why you will find that white noise for babies sleep is so helpful during the first few months after they are born.

But white noise isn't the only sound in town. Let's briefly touch upon other sound options:

*   **Pink Noise:** Similar to white noise, but with a greater intensity at lower frequencies. This gives it a deeper, richer sound. Many find pink noise more pleasant and less harsh than white noise.
*   **Brown Noise:** Even more emphasis on lower frequencies than pink noise, resulting in a very deep, rumbling sound.Some people find brown noise to be exceptionally soothing.
*   **Nature Sounds:** Sounds like ocean waves, rain, or forest ambience can also be effective sleep aids. These sounds are often more dynamic and varied than white noise, offering a more natural and immersive experience. many prefer these sounds when looking into ocean sounds for sleep and nature sounds for sleep.

Ultimately, the best sound for sleep is a matter of personal preference.Experiment with different options to find what works best for you.

Say hello to Anthropic, the AI startup making waves faster than you can say ""GPT-4."" In early March 2025, Anthropic proudly announced that its annualized revenue had soared by 40% since December 2024, putting it neck-and-neck with OpenAI’s timeline from 2023. 

The AI challenger didn't just reach these dizzying heights overnight. A major Series E funding round bolstered its capabilities with a cool $3.5 billion, valuing the company at a striking $61.5 billion. This influx of cash isn't for luxury office chairs or unnecessary snacks; Anthropic is accelerating its development to bring you the smart—and sometimes overly sassy—AI of tomorrow. 

One of the flagship features boosting its growth is ""Claude,"" named perhaps to distract us from the chaos AI might bring to startups everywhere. Claude 3.7 Sonnet isn’t just any AI bot—it promises hybrid reasoning, meaning it can either shoot off quick responses like a caffeine-fueled coder or take an unhurried, step-by-step approach. It’s kind of like that one friend who’s both shockingly spontaneous and annoyingly meticulous.

But Anthropic isn't stopping at charming chatbots; its vision extends to creating generalist foundation models catered for enterprise use without diving into the tangled webs of hardware. They've also got “Claude Code,” your new best friend in programming, allowing developers to hand off engineering tasks directly from their terminals. Imagine AI handling debugging while you sip your coffee in peace.

While Anthropic’s progress is exciting, it begs the question—are we looking at an AI renaissance or a startup apocalypse? As these technological titans expand, they may well be redefining traditional industries and their startups forever.

✅ **Rechargeable Battery** – No more swapping out disposable batteries.

Every time you started a fight and I just made it worse, when I should have just held you and told you how much I love you. The shoulds, woulds, and coulds are a trap.

So, something weird happened the other day at Pragathi Tiffins. I went there early in the morning (around 6 AM) to grab some idli and dosa. It was already busy, but there was this one guy in front of me who stood out.

He looked completely normal—middle-aged, wearing a formal shirt and trousers—but he kept ordering only idlis. And not just a few.

""10 plates idli.""
The cashier raised an eyebrow but entered the order.

Then, after paying, he didn’t leave the counter. Instead, he ordered 5 more plates.

I assumed he was buying for a big group or maybe a family breakfast. But the weird part? As soon as he got his order, he walked to a nearby bench, sat down, and started eating them alone.

One by one. Plate after plate. Just pure focus, no phone, no distractions. Just a man and his idlis.

I finished my dosa and coffee, and this dude was still at it, calmly eating his 15th idli like it was the most normal thing in the world.

I left before he finished, but now I can’t stop thinking—was he really that hungry? Was this a bet? A daily routine? Is there a secret society of extreme idli lovers I don’t know about?

If anyone has seen this guy, I need answers.

Do you know how hurt you have to be to block someone on Spotify? Only to find out later they’re selling your favorite artist’s tickets on a forum *you* introduced them to.



Or to randomly run into their childhood friend at a bar—only to realize they look exactly like your ex? And suddenly, the puzzle pieces fall into place: your ex-best friend always wanted your ex-girlfriend. Years later, you finally accept that your resentment was valid because you would’ve never treated them the way they treated you.



Forgiveness? Yeah, it’s important. But your ex-best friend used it as a manipulation tactic.

And deep down, you knew it.



They wanted to be you so bad.

Always made you feel like the problem, when they were just projecting.

Everything was a competition.

Had to gloat about how many people they pulled, as if it mattered.

Always deflected.

Made you feel like you *needed* them.

Gave unsolicited advice. Never followed their own.

Never *really* wanted to see you happy.

Took up so much space in your life.



And now? You’re learning to forgive yourself.

To be gentle with yourself.

To have grace.

To listen to your mind and body again.



Working on your sobriety.



Then one day, you run into your ex at the same place you first met.

Her new partner gives you a death stare.

You exchange a few polite words over coffee, but it’s nothing.



And there’s more. Way more. Too much to put into words.



One step forward, three steps back.

Feeling like you’re at square one again.

Overthinking. Spiraling. Wondering if you’ve even made progress at all.



And after all this? You *still* think of them.



The ups, the downs.

The wins, the losses.

Lessons learned. Lessons still waiting to be learned.



It’s 2AM. You can’t sleep.

Doomscrolling isn’t helping.

## Design and Comfort: A tale of Two Approaches

A⁢ telescope with a focal ratio⁣ of f/6 or ‌less will provide a wider field of view,making it easier to locate and observe ⁢the nebula.*   ‌**Filters:** Using a narrowband filter, such as an Oxygen-III (OIII) filter, can considerably enhance the contrast of the Mars Nebula by blocking‌ out unwanted light pollution. This is particularly ⁢useful when observing from urban areas.

*   **Technique:** Take‌ your time to locate the Mars Nebula using star charts or a GoTo telescope system. Once you've found it, allow your eyes to adjust to the ‍darkness for several minutes. Use averted vision (looking slightly to the side of the object) to improve your perception of faint ⁢details. Experiment with different magnifications and filters to optimize your viewing experience.
* ⁣  **Online resources:** Utilize online resources and astronomy forums to learn more about observing the Mars Nebula and connect with other amateur‍ astronomers.

A drop stores are smaller than plant locations for convenient drop-off and pick-ups for customers. We hold onto customers clothes for days, weeks, and even months sometimes as they’re hanging in the thin plastic bags in the back of the store.
The front of the store, from the customer’s POV, it’s bright, looks newly painted, has nice floors, hot coffee. It looks very appealing for customers looking to drop their clothes off at a “luxury dry cleaner.” This is currently what the back of the store looks like. It has been a bit snowy and cold in the recent months. It’s a very old and large building. When the weather gets below 0° F, the heat stops working properly. Resulting in my coworkers and I having to wear multiple layers of clothes, hats, and mittens, in order to stay warm during our shifts. We also only have freezing cold water in the bathroom to wash our hands, so that’s been fun in the winter. Recently, it has been getting warmer outside. YAY! But now all of the snow on the roof is melting… into the back of the store. It smells bad like mold back there and the POV of these pictures is me standing in between orders of customer’s clothes hanging up. These clothes are hidden behind a wall, behind the front counter and waiting to be picked up by their owners all fresh after a nice cleaning :’).

### **“Calvin Steps Up”**  

Calvin had always been perfectly content stepping aside. Group projects? He’d happily staple the papers. Family road trips? He was a world-class snack distributor. The motto was simple: **""Step up or step aside.""** And Calvin? Calvin stepped aside. Every time.  

Until today.  

It all started with the office fire drill. When **Debbie from HR** tripped over the coffee cart and face-planted into the emergency exit, chaos erupted. People screamed. Papers flew. **Gary** from accounting started hyperventilating into his tie. And amidst the pandemonium, Calvin heard himself shout:  

**“EVERYONE, FOLLOW ME!”**  

The room froze. Heads turned. Even the flickering exit sign seemed to pause in disbelief.  

**Calvin was stepping up.**  

**“Let’s move, people!”** he commanded, striding confidently toward the stairwell… which turned out to be the janitor’s closet. Undeterred, he spun around and marched toward the *actual* stairwell.  

**“Stay calm! Form a single file!”** he barked. His coworkers stared. No one moved. Calvin decided to set the example, pushing open the stairwell door… and smacking **Janice** in the face.  

**“Keep going!”** he yelled over Janice’s whimpering.  

Two flights down, the sprinklers exploded. Not because of the fire, but because Calvin tripped over his own shoelace and body-checked the emergency water valve. As water rained down, Calvin soldiered on. **“Stay low! Stop, drop, and roll!”** he shouted.  

**“There’s no fire, Calvin!”** Gary wheezed.  

When they finally reached the parking lot, drenched and gasping, **Debbie from HR** emerged with an ice pack on her nose. The fire marshal informed them there never was a fire — someone just microwaved fish again.  

Soaking wet and panting, Calvin looked around at his soggy coworkers.  

**“I stepped up,”** he whispered.  

Gary patted his shoulder. **“Yeah, buddy. And next time… you can step right back aside.”**  

The office unanimously agreed. Calvin’s stapling duties were reinstated, and leadership was left in far more capable hands.  

**The End.**

The health-conscious world today has led to a gigantic increase in the demand for zero-calorie sweeteners. Individuals seek substitutes for white sugar due to fear of weight gain, diabetes, and overall health problems. Yet, there is a general misconception that all sugar substitutes are man-made. While synthetic sweeteners like aspartame and saccharin have ruled the market for decades, there are natural options that have been eaten for centuries in a lot of cultures worldwide. 

Of these, Stevia sugar is very popular as one of the most studied and utilized natural sweeteners. Produced from the leaves of the Stevia plant, it gives a sweet taste without the negative impact on health due to refined sugar. But Stevia is not the sole natural sweetener. Some other plant-based sweeteners such as monk fruit, glycyrrhizin in licorice root, and miraculin in the miracle fruit also provide sweetness without additional calories.

Understanding these sweeteners, their benefits, and potential drawbacks is the key to making an informed decision on reducing sugar intake without sacrificing the desired level of sweetness in food and beverages.

# Origins and Benefits of Stevia Sugar

Natural Stevia or Stevia sugar is a natural product from the leaves of the South American Stevia rebaudiana plant. Stevia leaves have been utilized by Paraguayans and Brazilians for centuries to sweeten their teas and traditional medicine brews. The natural sweetness of the plant is attributed to its unique compounds, steviol glycosides, which give it the capability to provide potent sweetness with no accompanying calories.

The greatest benefit of Stevia sugar is that it has zero glycemic index, implying that it doesn't cause a blood sugar rise. Thus, it is the ideal choice for diabetics or individuals on a weight management diet. Secondly, scientific research shows that Stevia can contribute to several health benefits, such as blood glucose level management, reduction in inflammation, and a healthy heart.

In contrast to white sugar, which has been associated with obesity, tooth rot, and metabolic disease, Stevia does not lead to these harmful effects on health. Stevia has also been approved as a sugar substitute for safe use by agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), which further solidifies its status as a safe and effective sweetener.

# Types of Stevia and Its Useful Applications

Stevia is available in a number of different forms, which are best for various kinds of cooking. Dried stevia leaves are the most natural and can be infused in hot water or ground up to be used in cooking and baking. The majority of commercially available Stevia products, though, are available in liquid, powder, or granule forms.

Individuals most commonly employ stevia powder as a sweetener in baked goods, but they need to lower the quantity because stevia is sweeter than sugar. Liquid Stevia drops are a good choice for sweetening beverages such as coffee, tea, and smoothies. Other products of Stevia are blended with other sugar alcohols, such as erythritol, to generate a texture and taste nearer that of white sugar.

Though Stevia is an excellent sugar replacement, there are individuals who do feel a slightly unpleasant aftertaste, but this can vary depending on brand and processing. To offset this, high-purity content Stevia extracts rich in steviol glycosides should be utilized.

# Other Zero-Calorie Natural Sweeteners

https://preview.redd.it/lbgt30ku67oe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d20c6a3c47283e48bee29a64e15caa9bda18e386

Whereas [Stevia is among the most popular sugar substitutes](https://zindagistevia.com/the-surprising-health-benefits-of-using-natural-stevia-daily/?v=f9f0a42f293e), there are several other natural sweeteners with similar advantages. Various cultures have traditionally used these, and they are gaining popularity in contemporary health-oriented diets.

**Monk Fruit (Luo Han Guo)**

Monk fruit, or Luo Han Guo, is a sweetener made from a small Chinese melon. It has been used by Chinese herbalists for millennia as a treatment for all sorts of ills, from sore throats to stomach problems. The fruit's sweetness is due to compounds known as mogrosides, which are sweeter than sugar but carry no calories.

Similar to Stevia, monk fruit is a zero-calorie sweetener, hence the ideal choice for individuals who want to control their blood sugar. Monk fruit's heat stability characteristic implies that the sweetness is not diminished even when cooking and baking with it. In contrast to some artificial sweeteners, monk fruit does not possess a bitter aftertaste, hence why many people prefer using it a natural substitute for sugar.

**Glycyrrhizin (Licorice Root Sweetener)**

Glycyrrhizin is a plant-based sweetener from the licorice root genus. It is a century-old component of traditional herbal medicines that comes with profound sweetness and medicinal benefits. It is ubiquitous in herbal tea, traditional sweets, and sore throat and cough syrup medicines.

Although glycyrrhizin is calorie-free, excessive intake is harmful, particularly to blood pressure control. Excessive glycyrrhizin intakes have been reported to cause sodium retention and low potassium, thereby hypertension. Patients with hypertension or cardiovascular disease therefore need to consume licorice sweeteners in small amounts.

**Miraculin (Sweetener Fruit Miracle)**

Miraculin is a new natural sweetener from the West African miracle fruit. Unlike most other sweeteners, miraculin does not add sweetness per se but modifies the perception of taste. When consumed, miraculin binds to the taste receptors on the tongue and, for a short period of time, reverses sour tastes into sweet ones.

Because of this incredible trait, miraculin has been sold as a novelty sweetener instead of a traditional sugar substitute by companies. It has also been researched for its potential to reverse taste distortions experienced by chemotherapy patients. Not as well known as Stevia or monk fruit, miraculin is a unique and natural way to experience sweetness without calories.

# Why Natural Sweeteners Are Preferable to Artificial Ones

https://preview.redd.it/5l8sjxah97oe1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=840500f53ea765f63246ba4f42167a032d86d1c7

Artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharin, and sucralose have been used by people for many decades as substitutes for sugar. Nevertheless, consumers fear that these sweeteners can have undesirable health effects such as metabolic and gastrointestinal diseases. As a substitute, natural sweeteners offer a chemical-free alternative of sweetness without adverse effects on human health.



Different cultures have used natural sweeteners like stevia, monk fruit, glycyrrhizin, and miraculin for centuries because these sweeteners are plant-based. They do not contribute to weight gain, tooth decay, or insulin resistance, hence serving as a healthier option for those who are ready to cut down on sugar.

# Choosing the right sugar alternative

The ideal natural sweetener is a personal preference and function of nutritional demand. Stevia and monk fruit are great general-purpose sweeteners, flavoring beverages, desserts, and dishes. Glycyrrhizin is especially useful in herbal medicine and traditional confectionery, whereas miraculin is mostly utilized solely for its distinctive capability to change the character of food.

For those who wish to transition from refined sugar, trying several natural sweeteners will assist them in selecting the most suitable one for their individual taste buds and health needs. It is also prudent to use high-quality, minimally processed sweeteners for optimal flavor and nutritional value.

# Conclusion

The growing awareness of the ill effects of sugar intake has been pushing individuals towards natural and healthier alternatives. [Stevia sugar ](https://zindagistevia.com/?v=f9f0a42f293e)is one highly sought and well-studied natural sweetener that exists, offering the same sweetness for zero calories. Besides Stevia, the existence of monk fruit, glycyrrhizin, and miraculin means, one has more varied options with, to use less sugar for that natural sweetness.

By taking smart choices and incorporating natural sweeteners into daily lives, individuals can make a giant stride towards better health, reduced calorie consumption, and overall better well-being.

I oiled the cake tin really well and added baking paper so maybe that’s why it pulled away? 

 I couldn’t recall doing anything wrong until I looked back at the recipe and realised I added an extra 1/3 a cup of sugar then I was meant to. Would that be the reason it sunk so badly. 

there is crushed pineapple added into it but i squeezed out as much juice as I could. 

The other baker hasn’t had an issue with the recipe and I cooked it for the same time and temperature as she has ",1,1741760553.0,bakingfail,1,1.0,False

I don’t know your voice, your favorite coffee order, or the kind of music that gets stuck in your head on quiet afternoons. But for a time, you were a part of my world, even if you never knew it.

I used to see you every morning and evening, a quiet presence in the rhythm of my days. You’d step off in front of San Miguel Corporation, always in a jacket, sometimes with a face mask on, like you were guarding a part of yourself from the world. And yet, even in your silence, you stood out.

You had this aura—cool, distant, but not unkind. A mix of aloof and shy, like someone who had a world of thoughts behind those deep, expressive eyes. And maybe it was nothing, maybe it was just my imagination, but there were moments when I thought you saw me, too.

I never had the courage to say a word. I told myself you were just a stranger, that people come and go, that I had no right to hold on to someone I never truly met. But here I am, writing this, because even after all this time, I still remember you. And maybe that means something.

I don’t expect you to ever read this. I don’t expect fate to pull some grand twist and lead me back to you. But if, by some impossible chance, you happen to see this—if you recognize yourself in these words—then just know that for a while, in a world full of strangers, someone noticed you. Someone wondered about you. Someone still does.

I hope you’re doing well, wherever you are. And if this is all we’ll ever be—a fleeting memory, a name never spoken—then at least now, you exist beyond just my thoughts.

Got through all the initial paperwork and online AFSEC forms, took PICAT then was scheduled for MEPS in Denver relatively quickly. It was delayed once but I made it the 24-25th of February. I rather enjoyed it, although on medical day I was second in and second to last out. A 3 am to 6 pm day. 

Day 1, Test Day

I scored 95 AFQT and 95 to 97 on technical sections. I did study as I wanted to ensure an excellent entry. I barely slept the night before in anticipation so by the end of the day I was very tired. The food at the hotel was very good.

Day 2, Medical

Woke up 3 am, dropped off my key and ate a decent amount. I made the mistake of NOT drinking coffee which normally helps me to have to go pee.

Medical was a very long day. The biggest struggle was the pee part because I just struggled to go. I kept drinking and drinking water and was the last guy to pee. Then blood I was one of the last also, but beyond that I just had the interview, hearing and vision having passed height and weight, blood pressure requirements. They left us in the hearing test booth for a little while and I nearly fell asleep. 

My eye test was last and it was already getting a bit late afternoon. I did fail depth perception but my eyes are correctable to the desired numbers, however, my medical records showed a slight corneal scar and I had to schedule a consult to get a waiver for that. I'm really hoping that goes through okay. The appointment is on the 31st.

I really do hope that's not disqualifying.

I'm keeping up on fitness and studying up on which job I'd like to do.

1j9d6d0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j9d6d0/me_m24_and_my_supposed_love_of_my_life_gf_f22_who/,Me (M24) and My supposed love of my life gf (F22) who i have not met expects me to make 300k a year so we can start dating irl and and so HER dad would accept me because im not white Im struggling to breakup and let go. . How do i deal with this?,"Ive been ""dating"" this girl for 2-3 years and we havent met because she has social anxiety and her parents wont let her. The thing is she wants to be in a relationship but not meet? she goes out with friends but wont even grab a coffee with me, her long time ""bf"". im putting it in quotes since we are online dating even tho she lives an hour away. At the start of us talking i said i cant do this online thing, but she proceeds to love bomb me even though she states she cant date. I know its my fault for even giving in and following through to date her. It all starts out nice and i thought she would eventually change her mind or come around once she gets to know me.... but no i was not enough for her even after 3 years for her to meet me. I got tired of the online dating and when i presented my needs again, it would cause a fight. My needs were to simply meet irl slowly as i needed physical interactions with my gf as any human would want. But that idea to her was impossible. I even gave her an ultimatum that we can breakup or we can try to meet irl but on her terms to make it comfy as possible but no that caused another fight and she started calling me unfair for wanting to meet and too breakup yet again. another problem i have with her is she expects me to make 300k a year so her family will accept me since im not a white man. She also says she wants to know that she will be taken care of, but thats so unrealistic im only 23 and shes 20 not even working herself. I just got a job recently to start progressing for my life and career and shes mad now that i dont spend any time with her 24/7 cause im working and taking care of other responsibilities like taking care of my dog and family. Obviously if i dont have time for a girl i shouldnt be in a relationship but i can make time but it wont be 24/7. That still isnt enough for her.

I worked my ass off 11hrs a day for 3 months and stopped talking to her as much since i really wanted my career to take priority and earn money. She started being so hostile and brought me down for having a job and not giving her attention. she would call me anything and everything to put me down. Then when i speak up against her and explain myself she says im justifying and invalidating her feelings by not giving her needs priority. She also got upset when i wouldnt buy her something for after i told her im saving and want to not spend anything i dont even spend on myself yet she expects me to buy shit for her and i dont im an asshole. I dont judge people and i believe shes a nice girl but she is exhausting me but i cant let go, I need help. Shes said she could get a rich guy if she wanted to, like is that supposed to make me feel good ;-;.

The other problem is im so blinded by love i keep staying and have a hard time ending it with her. we spent so much time together i cant leave. i feel so alone when we would ""breakup"" i dont enjoy gaming or any of my hobbies i shared with her cause it would remind me of her. She keeps saying i love you and then proceeds to diss me and my whole existence if i dont act the way she wants. ON top of all this she wont even date or ""marry me"" if dont meet her standards then blames me for causing fights when i get irritated how my needs are not met but i have to meet hers.

I know this is all very cringy and not normal, but i really did/do love this girl, i just dont know why she is acting like this. Some days she loves me and others she resents me. I know im an idiot and should block her and get tf out but my heart hurts, i tried really hard to be a good person to her but why isnt that enough for her.",0,1741760312.0,relationship_advice,13,0.33,False
