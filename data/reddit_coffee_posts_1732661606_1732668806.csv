1h0rscx,https://www.reddit.com/r/The10thDentist/comments/1h0rscx/most_medical_doctors_are_garbage_at_their_jobs/,Most medical doctors are garbage at their jobs and know nothing about healing the human body or they simply dont care.,"Sure, they're amazing in emergency situations and are your best bet for survival in those cases. However when it comes to healing disease, getting healthy, staying healthy, and living without disease, most doctors are a complete joke.

If you go to the doctor with a problem. Lets say it's high blood pressure. You're well outside of the normal range clearly indicating a problem. Chances are, a doctor is just going to put you on blood pressure medication that you will need to take for the rest of your life. Doctor will have you come back in a couple of weeks to make sure its working, and he'll pat himself on the back for a job well done when your numbers are in the normal range.

But here's the problem.. a TON of things can cause high blood pressure. Could be a deficiency, an imbalance, an allergy, being overweight, stress, fungus, parasites, a side effect of another medication, too much coffee, poor diet, etc. Whatever the case, the high blood pressure is a symptom of an underlying problem. Chances are your doctor didnt do a single bit of testing to rule out a single one of these things to properly address and find a solution to the problem so that you could actually become healthy and not need to be on any medication. They just made you a lifelong customer to big pharma and sent you back out the door with more problems than you had when you went in.

Most doctors just look at a symptom and then give you permission to take a pill that will address that symptom with absolutely no regard for the cause of it. And guess what? The pill they will give you will almost certainly cause you more ""symptoms"" for them to give you MORE medication for.

Here is another way of looking at it, You come into your kitchen one day and notice a puddle of water in the floor... Now, most people are smart enough to search for the underlying cause of the puddle, the busted water line hiding under the sink. They're not going to just grab a towel and keep cleaning up the same puddle without addressing the cause of it. This is essentially what most doctors do.

I dont know if this is because they're genuinely incompetent and lack the skills, knowledge, or basic critical thought processes to think like the above, or if they dont actually care and are too lazy to try. Either way, there's a problem and they dont deserve the money they're paid.",0,1732668441.0,The10thDentist,1,0.4,False

I wanted to come back and offer an update today because I have successfully made it through the most challenging day yet. Before I get to that a quick TLDR. I’m married to my HS sweetheart and have had a severe porn addiction on and off dating back to my childhood. I’ve experience a bunch of trauma which has definitely made me this way and I’m finally doing my best to make sure I break the cycle by quitting porn. 

Update time:
So today is the first day that we have had apart from one another since I last posted here. We both took an extended weekend because we’re trying to kill PTO time before we lose it at years end. We went on a date yesterday to our favorite beach and admired the water from the car while we ate lunch and had hot coffees. 

Today is a different story. I had tons of idle time at work where I had the strongest urges to watch porn and buy custom content again from an online creator. It was like an impulse I couldn’t avoid. I went on Twitter today and saw some nude women on my timeline. I immediately closed the app but it sent me on a spiral. I started browsing all my favorite NSFW Reddit subs, getting greeted by the “do you want to continue” prompt and quickly backing out. I did this like 30 times today at least. 

But I didn’t do it. I didn’t buy porn much less even watch it. I did practice some self love for the first time since I quit porn though. I actually had fantasies about me and my wife together for the first time since we were first dating. I haven’t wanted her this badly in a long time. I still feel so guilty about how bad my porn addiction got but this is a step towards progress. I didn’t give in to my urges and I can honestly say I’m proud of myself for it. I know that this progress might not be forever as relapse is often a part of the addiction process. For today I’m content with how I was able to make it through. Tomorrow marks 1 week clean. Yay!!

1h0rq92,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1h0rq92/dating_a_bpd_girl/,Dating a bpd girl,"Me (m28) came out from a 5 year long relationship on may, 1 month ago while traveling to another state, without looking for anyone, met a girl (29F) in a coffee while having breakfast on a morning, we clicked and ended up going out until I pretty much came back home, 3 weeks of interacting each other everyday, it was amazing, and, she would want to pay for EVERY date we had, she'd always try to spend so much on me even though we barely were getting to know  each other a bit more, she shared a lot of her background with me, I wasn't so sure why. I told her that I needed to get to know her better for some time, she also needed to get to know me as a person, to determine if we could be a good couple in a future.

  
But she indirectly would talk about serious relationship topics, as if she was in a rush. 

When I came back home, my ex, who happens to be a therapist of some family members, for some reason accepted her issues and said she may not return with me agian but wants to be OK, and so I told her I met a girl while traveling cuz lets be honest, playing with people isnt nice, so Im trying to be glass transparent, with each party. My ex is ok and says its a good idea for me to consider to leave and meet other people, specially if there's grow opportunities for me.

  
Which, happened to be. Found job openings where I traveled, and Im really tempted, specially because I told this girl I met up there, and she offers me support, and a lot of help that could potentially benefit me greatly in my career.

  
Then she talked with me, and stated she has BPD, but ensures me that shes getting appropiate treatment for years now. But suddenly what I noticed while I interacted with her, for instance, one of her pets died, and she pretty much froze, and was deeply depressed, not in a normal way, but like, her whole life stopped right there, it is surely a tough loss, but still, never saw someone so affected this way honestly.

  
Now, Im wondering if I should stay where I am and forget this idea, avoid getting involved, OR if I should give this a try and, well, attempt to have something sweet and honest with her, I don't have any experience with people who has this condition. I feel like a sprout, I accept, I don't have any experience in this topic, and I wouldn't want to cause this girl issues, neither to myself",1,1732668270.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

I'm new to the real estate world and am just taking my online courses now in Canada. I met with a couple of real estate agents in my area for coffee chats and recently one of the agents I met with said I should reach out to his broker and connect.

Their agency is small (only 11 agents) and this is what primarily attracts me to them, today I had coffee with the owner and broker of the agency and asked him if I were to come on board what kind of fees I would be paying.

I've heard of monthly payments and commission splits being high, so I was shocked when he told me they dont charge a desk fee and they only take 15% of the commission until you make 300K in a year and then they take only 5%. He also said everyone has a desk space/office space and parking spots are included, and was honest with me that they dont have a training program but do mentourships and everyone kinda helps out as a team. 

He is so sweet and genuine, I feel like I can talk to him and he genuinely seems like he wants to help me succeed. Is there any catch to this??? It feels too good to be true but im hoping it's not because I love the energy and would love to join their agency when I get my license. 

any thoughts are appreciated TIA :)  ",1,1732668125.0,realtors,2,1.0,False
1h0rnnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1h0rnnb/day_200_something/,Day 200 something ,"Having one of those days.

Nothing too crazy, but enough to make me feel a little wound up and have trouble relaxing. I was stuck in a stress downfall about 7 months ago - that lasted for 3 months and I eventually got really unwell from it (nearly passing out in a coffee shop with low blood pressure and arrhythmia). So now, any time I feel a little stressed, it freaks me out a bit. That’s probably something I should focus on addressing.

Nothing crazy happened, just minor (but out of the ordinary) little work stresses that came up right before I’m supposed to leave for the holiday and I felt like I spent the majority of my day putting out those little fires. 

Then I went to the store to get some sparkling waters and a carrot and realized the mistake I made going to the store two days before Thanksgiving.

Right when I got home, cradling my box of waters, carrot in hand - my attached neighbor decided to call me out for not recycling the Vermont way. Literally had to listen to a lesson about how she dug through our recycling and noted all the things I did wrong. When I went back inside and googled, I couldn’t really tell what she was on about, except the fact I could be better at rinsing my materials like my cat cans. Then was asking where I was going for the holidays and who was watching my cat. The type of invasive I don’t care to share with a neighbor that’s a stranger too. It was just, like, a little too much for me today. 

Who knew, out of all the times I’ve piled disturbing amounts of alcohol cans into a recycling - fully ashamed of myself (and probably with other careless/sloppy recycling in-between) - that this is the first time I get called out. Stone-cold sober 🤣

Life really has a way. 

But, all minor stuff and I’m working on unwinding finally. 

I’m wishing you all the best on your holiday weekend here in the States, and all the best to my international friends too. 

Keep on hanging in there! You’re doing great and I’m rooting for you! ❤️",1,1732668062.0,stopdrinking,0,1.0,False

I had ChatGPT roast flex and dsp drivers here is what it came up with.


Amazon Flex vs. Amazon DSP: The Roast That’ll Make Everyone Quit

---

Amazon Flex Drivers: The “Entrepreneurs”

""Be your own boss!"" they said. Yeah, except your boss is Jeff Bezos’ app, which ghosts you for hours when you need a block. You’re the only boss who begs for work and checks your phone more than a teenager waiting for a text back.

Congrats on owning your car! Too bad it smells like regret, spilled coffee, and 400 Amazon packages. Hope that $18/hour feels worth it when your brakes and sanity give out.

Flex drivers swear they’re living the dream, but you’re out here dodging delivery instructions written in hieroglyphics while Jeff Bezos is dodging taxes from his yacht.

“Pick your hours!” they say. Sure, if by “picking” you mean fighting 10 other drivers for that one golden $60 block at Whole Foods.



---

Amazon DSP Drivers: The Corporate Gladiators

You’re not even delivering packages—you’re delivering Jeff Bezos another superyacht. And what do you get in return? A crumpled van, a soggy lunch, and 300 packages with the GPS screaming, “Recalculating!”

They call it a “team,” but it’s just you and a supervisor who lives to remind you, “You’re behind schedule.” Oh, sorry! Let me just teleport these 50 boxes to the fifth-floor apartment with no elevator!

Let’s talk about that uniform: nothing says “career progression” like sweating through a vest that barely fits while Bezos laughs in a tailored suit worth more than your van.

You’re expected to “hustle with care,” but good luck doing that when your delivery route looks like a connect-the-dots map for psychos. Hope you enjoy the van’s AC—oh wait, it’s broken.



---

Jeff Bezos: The Puppet Master

Oh, you thought you were making money for yourself? Nah, you’re just a cog in Bezos’ trillion-dollar delivery machine. He’s chilling in space while Flex drivers fight over scraps and DSP drivers carry the weight of his dreams—literally.

Bezos built this empire on your back, and the only ""Prime"" thing you’ll ever get is Prime exhaustion. Meanwhile, he’s deciding whether to buy another mansion or just buy the planet.



---

Who Wins the Roast?

Neither of you. Flex and DSP drivers are just pawns in Bezos’ intergalactic chess game. The real battle isn’t Flex vs. DSP—it’s all of you vs. the billionaire laughing his way to Mars while you struggle to find parking.

Background: I am a non-native English speaker studying in a non-English speaking country. I am expected to graduate this semester (sent my thesis out last night, defence in two weeks, wish me luck). I switched from a Design field to a Quantitative Social Science, hadn’t taken standardised tests (besides TOEFL) in 10 years. My programs expect 162-165+ Quant. 

I took the test on 13 Oct (159Q, 162V, 4AWA), after taking one mock-test (156Q, 155V) and a 4-day unproductive run of quant exercises on GregMat, no strategy for anything. Results weren’t horrible but not as competitive, and applications are too much work/money for me not to give it my best. 

My first PhD deadline was on 15 Nov and that was also the only day I could schedule my 2nd test. I had 23 days, so I had to be extremely organised. I could afford around 3h max of study a day, and I needed free weekends. 

Strategy: 

* Morning: focused study session, 3-4h/day 
* Afternoon/Evening: thesis/research/lab work
* Weekend: PhD application materials + extra prep

Scaffolding:

* Fixed sleep schedule (7-00am), 40-60min off screens before bed, coffee only on Fridays 
* Fixed meal plan (efficiency + nutrition + budget xD)  
* Added moderate exercise 4x/week  
* Day split into fixed blocks to allocate activities  

How it went: the day after results for 1st test came out, I took another mock test on GregMat and got 160Q, 154V, it almost made me give up trying again. My goal was 335, 5.0.  

I prioritised Quant because my Maths test-taking skills were extremely out of shape. I had *\_very little time\_* so I watched all videos on 1.5x and tried to complete 2-3 a day. I did all Quant Dedicated + 6 Basic Quizzes + 10-12 Test Your Concepts + 5-6 Toolkit/Strategy ones. I am an ""Algebra person"" (lol) so I practiced noticing when Choosing Numbers was more efficient.   
  
Quant: 

* Started with ETS review, switched to GregMat Quant dedicated after 2 days (best choice)  
* Timing myself since day 1  
* Tracking recurring shortcomings (with lists) 
* \+ Extra practice sheets for recurring problems 
* Double review: end of session + start of next 

For Verbal, I knew my mid scores were due to unfamiliarity with the test, so I prioritised strategy and toolkit. 

For Writing, the plan was to focus during my last week but there was simply no time. All I could do was watch videos to recall the structure of a 5-paragraph essay + memorise specific tips for each part. First time, I wrote way too little, no examples, and left an incomplete paragraph (lol). But I am a good writer in general, just needed time to practice… which I didn’t have 😅

Verbal + Writing: 

* GregMat Verbal Toolkit (weekdays) 
* 2-4 vocab videos/podcasts (weekends) 
* Vocab flashcards 1-3x/week 
* Essay-writing videos 

Test + Results: essay prompt was not bad. Just got words out. The keyboard I had was awful but I managed it and it came out much better than the first one. I expected it would be a 5.0 and I was right. 

Into the other sections, I got Quant first, then Verbal. Both Verbal had 2-3 questions that I had to think hard about but I had almost 8 mins left both times. Now, Quant… I screwed up both sections, got stuck in a problem because of a stupid mistake during the 1st, had to redo two questions and messed up my timing for 2nd. If I still came out of that with a reasonable score, it’s all thanks to foundations + strategy holding the rest together. I wanted at least 165Q but the 170V comforted my frustration. 

I went out of the testing room straight into study cafés to finish my first PhD application, 42h of no sleep, but I could do it because my body and mind were not as exhausted as they would have been, had I not been as careful about the state of my body and mind during this process. 

Overall, this was a FUN process, I am happy with the results, not exactly my goal but a fair improvement considering the time I had \^\^",3,1732667216.0,GRE,0,1.0,False

1h0rc05,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1h0rc05/narcissism_without_the_maliciousness_benign/,Narcissism without the maliciousness (benign narcissism),"For years I’ve struggled with understanding my mom, because she’s always shown every single sign of narcissistic personality disorder, except for the malicious aspect. She has zero ability to empathize, she has an extremely inflated sense of confidence, she’s extremely arrogant and entitled, very invasive and inconsiderate, etc. I’ve had complex trauma for as long as I can remember. But she never went out of her way to be malicious or cruel. Honestly she’s such a simple minded person I don’t even think she’s capable of manipulating or knowing what kinds of things would hurt people. 

She even recently agreed to start family therapy with my dad and I, which I thought was a pretty rare thing for a narcissist. It was so confusing because I knew without a doubt she had no empathy and never thought about others, but without the intentional aspect of cruelty, I didn’t know what to make of her. Like, she wasn’t exactly a monster, but she wasn’t even close to being a real mother. 

But today I finally googled “non malignant narcissist” and realized benign narcissism exists. And my entire life makes sense. She IS a full blown narcissist, but without the abusive behavior. If it doesn’t sound as bad, it’s because it isn’t (at least in my opinion, compared to what I’ve read here… horrifying). I actually have two siblings that managed to turn out relatively fine. I just drew the short stick with the personality disorders. 

Unlike my siblings I was an extremely sensitive + emotional kid, and growing up as the oldest daughter with someone incapable of empathy destroyed my psyche. I was the standard neglected toddler that never cried, never acted out, never bothered admitting any needs because my mom never met them anyways. My mom loves talking about how easy I was. My entire childhood was years of emotional 
neglect, suicidal thoughts from as early as I can remember, severe depression, extreme social anxiety, and always being forced into so many activities and things I begged and sobbed not to be apart of (usually from anxiety). I was SUCH an obviously anxious kid and I don’t even think she realized it. 

Never once has she ever thought anything along the lines of “Hm, my daughter seems to be struggling.” She just doesn’t see me. She would come visit me in the psych ward but literally never once think to ask how I was feeling. She doesn’t see anyone except herself. She’s seen me hysterically sob at my worst, and even attempted to provide hollow comfort, but as soon as the next day comes, it’s like it never happened. She never checks in or thinks to follow up. She doesn’t think about the past at all. The only thing that’s real to her is whatever is happening in the present moment right in front of her. Otherwise she will never think about it again. 

Everything about her is hollow. She has no real friends, no real hobbies, no real interests. She genuinely thinks she’s better than all her coworkers and bosses despite never lasting more than a couple years at each of her jobs (usually due to conflict on her end). She LOVES talking about what a great “people person” she is. She thinks everyone loves talking to her (she’s every customer service worker’s worst nightmare.) 

All she knows how to talk about is herself, or gossip about other people. If you try to tell her anything about yourself or your life that’s more than a sentence or two, you can genuinely see this lifeless look in her eyes, like she’s not fully there. Then you’ll end your sentence, and her next one will completely disregard anything you’ve just said. 

She’s completely incapable of complex thought but genuinely thinks she’s one of the most intelligent people around her. There’s no reasoning with her because she’s incapable of changing her viewpoint or opinion (she proudly voted for RFK and views this as moral progress). Every bit of evidence or reasoning against her beliefs is completely met with a defensive eye roll and a snarky “Oh, whatever”. 

Back when I had friends in elementary school, she had no shame about yelling at me in front of them, to the point of terrifying my friends at a birthday sleepover and causing us all to end the night and go to sleep out of fear. She just never considers her audience whatsoever. She was once with some of my liberal friends from my liberal college and truly didn’t see the issue with scoffing about how mcdonald’s workers don’t need to make more than minimum wage. 

It was always confusing because she was actually very physically present in my life (overly present and invasive as a kid) but the genuine caring just isn’t there. I used to love how she would always agree to meet me for brunch, until I started to realize she would ask the same exact casual questions and talk about the same meaningless topics with every single encounter. (“Do you drink coffee?"" After 25 years of actively hating coffee.)

I’ve had lifelong mental illness and complex trauma but when she talks about my siblings and I’s various childhood delays, she follows it up with a lighthearted reassurance “Oh, they turned out totally fine!” Except I didn’t speak for the first few years of my life and now have alogia so it’s not exactly fine on my end. 

I read a post from a few years ago that described benign narcissism perfectly - “It’s like if some 1970s AI was in charge of raising kids, and was programmed to care, but could never do it effectively because it lacked real empathy. There’s always this real connection lacking, this miasma that something isn’t right.”

Occasionally if I poke her hard enough, I can finally see this visceral anger start to show through. She HATES being genuinely confronted or called out. And the angrier she gets, the more you know you’re hitting a nerve. She still does the classic DARVO shit. But it’s always unsettling when I see that anger in her eyes and hear it in her tone. Normally she’s so dismissive and sarcastic that you never really get to that point with her, but when you do it’s a really shitty reminder that she’ll never be capable of having a real conversation or ever understanding. She doesn’t have a single clue who I am",3,1732667140.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

1h0r83b,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1h0r83b/unsolicited_postmo_testimony/,Unsolicited Postmo Testimony 🥲 ,"Hey Exmo Reddit,
It’s been a few years since our faith crisis. Shelf broke in 2019 and the I deconstructed and thankfully, my husband decided to come with me through 2020-2021. I did a brief stint on TikTok in 2021 and joined Nemo for a few of his brilliant Conference Commentaries, as a creative outlet for my own pain and to help others digest as much of the craziness as possible.

Anyway, about 3 years in to our crisis, I left the Postmo scene in order to clear my head and  rebuild a life and family presence that was not dependent on being part of the church or being formerly part of the Church.

It was an insane amount of work, even without staying up on all my favorite podcasters, channels and Reddit. Those things were all critical for me during the active deconstruction aspect of leaving but there is a point at which it became an exercise in frustration and disappointment to just watch the Church flagellate members with shame, sue victims, and expel the brave people who stood up for them over and over.

During the rebuilding period, my husband and I both benefitted hugely from personal coaching, embodiment modalities, binaural beats, psychedelic therapies, and a ton of talking in which we just kept reprogramming ourselves again and again as our old programming beliefs continued to pop up.

I want to say, now—5 YEARS after the real shelf breaking— that I feel the air clearing. And the only time I really think about Mormonism now is when  I wish I could still connect casually with byu friends or when I stand all amazed (as I frequently do) that life is SO good now and that I feel so much freedom, purpose, meaning, and health blossoming in my life personally and in our family.

I would have (and did) claimed total certainty within the church and would have identified as super happy being a member there, but in retrospect, I said and believed most of those things out of the earnest desire to be accepted by people I love and because I didn’t know anything else.

Now, I am less certain about everything and also less “happy” but that’s because I experience a full range of emotion and experience now and I feel like I can validate ALL of those ups and downs as part of a life well lived.

My children are unequivocally better off for not having the church. They are young, but already they are more nuanced about spirituality, more in tune with their own desires, more sexually literate, and less insecure than I was when I got married.

My husband is flourishing. He is more confident, more good looking, and more secure financially than ever. Pornography has not been threatening to us and I am proud of him and how he has used (ethically produced) erotic media to actually challenge systems and ideas that try to repress female bodies and sexuality. 

Oh, and one of core rituals together is our supplement-enhanced morning coffee. ❤️☕️

The only things I miss about Church these days are singing regularly and the comfort of a strong community structure, but I’m working on filling in those gaps in our experience and I will get there with time.

If you are in the middle of the heartbreak that is faith crisis or if you are figuring out what life looks like on the other side, then I am sending you SO MUCH love and encouragement. I don’t know what your life after Mormonism looks like but I know that for us—leaving the mess of dogma, shame, elitism, guilt, fear, overwork, and victimhood that is the Church has brought an immense amount of growth and joy and has healed our personal relationship as well as our relationships with our loved ones who have felt rejected by the church🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️. 

I feel grateful all the time that we were brave enough to see the process through. Some of those dark nights of the soul seriously are so dark. There is a wisdom to the process though. Take breaks when you need them, accept that you will make mistakes, remember that pleasure is not a dirty word, and really feel everything--the grief, the pain, the rejection, the disappointment, too--and you will get through it! 💪

Hope this helps. We are wishing each and all of you every success!👐


In the name of every fiber of my being,

Awomen 😘

Ever found yourself slouching over your desk, squinting at your screen, and wondering why your back aches after just an hour of work? I sure have! That's when I stumbled into the world of ergonomics, a topic that's not just for office managers anymore. It's about making our spaces work for us, not against us. Let me share my personal journey, from ergonomic newbie to poster child (quite literally!), and help you create your own awareness ergonomics poster.
  
  
## The Awkward Truth

Here's the chapter following the specified guidelines:

Let me tell you about my embarrassing workspace disaster that changed everything. Picture this: me, hunched over like a human pretzel, neck twisted at an impossible angle, surrounded by a chaotic mess of papers and a laptop perched precariously on a stack of old textbooks. My back screamed in protest, but did I listen? Nope.

_Ergonomics_ sounds like a fancy scientific term, but it's actually super simple. It's basically the art of designing your workspace to fit your body perfectly. Think of it like tailoring a suit, but for your entire work environment.

My wake-up call came during a particularly brutal work week. I was experiencing shooting pains down my arm, constant headaches, and this weird clicking sound in my shoulder that definitely wasn't normal. One morning, after popping yet another painkiller, I realized something had to change.

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/awareness-ergonomics-poster> 

I discovered that my ""workspace"" was a recipe for physical disaster. My chair was too low, my monitor was at eye level only if I was standing, and my keyboard placement? Let's just say it was more ""random chaos"" than ""intentional design.""

The moment I started understanding ergonomics was like discovering a secret superpower. Suddenly, I wasn't just surviving my workday - I could actually enjoy it without feeling like I'd been through a physical wrestling match.

Who knew comfort could be so revolutionary?

## Meet Your New Best Friend: The Awareness Ergonomics Poster

Here's the chapter focusing on the awareness ergonomics poster:

Let me tell you about my secret weapon in the battle against workplace discomfort: the awareness ergonomics poster. This isn't just a piece of paper hanging on the wall - it's a lifeline for anyone who spends hours hunched over a computer.

My poster became a game-changer when I realized most people (including myself) have no clue how to sit properly. I designed it with bold, eye-catching graphics that literally scream ""Hey, your posture is killing you!"" The key elements are simple but powerful: a stick figure demonstrating perfect sitting posture, color-coded zones highlighting potential strain areas, and quick-reference ergonomic tips.

I'll never forget creating this poster. Picture this: me, surrounded by sticky notes, markers everywhere, looking like a mad scientist of workplace wellness. At one point, I accidentally knocked over my coffee, creating a massive brown splatter that looked suspiciously like an additional anatomical diagram. My cat gave me a look that said, ""Really? This is what you're doing with your time?""

The most hilarious moment came when I hung the poster and caught my colleagues doing exaggerated ""perfect posture"" poses, almost like a workplace yoga class. Some even started striking dramatic poses whenever someone walked by the poster.

But here's the real magic: awareness. This poster transformed our workspace from a potential injury zone to a mindful environment where people actually think about how they sit and move.

## The Ergo Audit: Assessing Your Space

Here's the chapter on the ergonomic audit:

The moment I decided to transform my workspace, I knew I needed a systematic approach. Armed with nothing more than a measuring tape, my smartphone, and a weird sense of determination, I began my personal ergonomic audit.

First, I measured everything. And I mean _everything_. My chair height, desk dimensions, monitor position - no detail was too small. I discovered my chair was 2 inches too low, causing my shoulders to hunch like a stressed-out turtle. My monitor? Sitting so low it was practically begging my neck to strain.

My improvised tools became my best allies. A stack of hardcover books elevated my monitor to eye level. Who knew ""Moby Dick"" could be more than just a novel? A rolled towel provided lumbar support when my cheap office chair failed me. Pro tip: creativity trumps expensive equipment.

The most surprising discovery? My keyboard placement was wreaking havoc on my wrists. Slight angle adjustments reduced tension I didn't even realize I was experiencing. I created a makeshift wrist rest using a folded microfiber cloth - budget-friendly and surprisingly effective.

Measurement became my mantra. Comfort, my ultimate goal. Each adjustment felt like a small victory in my ergonomic revolution. My body started thanking me, one alignment at a time.

Want to conduct your own audit? Grab a tape measure, be curious, and listen to what your body tells you.

## The Chair Challenge: Finding Your Perfect Seat

Here's the chapter for the article:

My chair hunt was nothing short of a comedic adventure. I'd always thought a chair was just a chair—how wrong I was! My first ""ergonomic"" purchase was a disaster. I found this sleek-looking office chair at a discount store, thinking I'd scored a major deal. Spoiler alert: I hadn't.

The first week was torture. My back felt like it had been through a medieval stretching rack. The chair looked amazing but felt like sitting on a wooden plank wrapped in fancy fabric. Who knew comfort wasn't just about appearances?

Budget was my biggest challenge. Quality ergonomic chairs can cost more than my monthly grocery budget. So I got creative. I started watching YouTube reviews, reading endless forums, and asking everyone I knew about their chair experiences. Pro tip: office workers are surprisingly passionate about chair talk!

I discovered some game-changing strategies: • Always test a chair before buying • Look for adjustable lumbar support • Check weight capacity and height range • Consider your specific body type • Don't just trust online reviews blindly

My breakthrough came when a physiotherapist friend recommended looking beyond brand names. She explained that expensive doesn't always mean comfortable. Some mid-range chairs offer incredible support if you know what to look for.

The hunt continued, but now I was armed with knowledge—and a sense of humor about the whole ridiculous process.

## Screen Time: The Perfect View

Here's the chapter focusing on screen ergonomics:

My first real wake-up call about monitor positioning came during a brutal week of neck pain that felt like I'd wrestled a angry bear. Picture this: my laptop perched precariously on a wobbly tower of old textbooks, my neck craned downward at an angle that would make a chiropractor weep.

**The Perfect Screen Setup**

Ergonomic experts recommend positioning your monitor at eye level, creating a straight line from your ears to your shoulders. This isn't just fancy advice - it's a game-changer for preventing neck and shoulder strain. I learned the hard way that improvised solutions like book stacks are a recipe for disaster.

My creative fix? A sturdy laptop stand I found online for less than $30\. Suddenly, my screen was perfectly aligned, and my neck thanked me. Pro tip: your monitor should be about an arm's length away, preventing eye strain while keeping everything comfortably in view.

For those working with desktop monitors, adjustable monitor arms are a lifesaver. They let you easily tweak height and angle, transforming your workspace from a potential pain zone to an ergonomic paradise. I discovered that small adjustments can make massive differences in comfort.

Bonus hack: If you're on a budget, stack some sturdy books or invest in a simple laptop stand. Your body will appreciate the thoughtful positioning, and you'll avoid those cringe-worthy neck angles that lead to serious discomfort.

## The Grand Finale: Creating Your Awareness Ergonomics Poster

Here's the chapter for the article:

Let me tell you, creating an ergonomic awareness poster isn't just about slapping some stick figures onto a piece of paper. It's an art form that requires creativity, humor, and a dash of personal flair!

I started by gathering my design materials: colorful markers, sticky notes, and a giant poster board that looked more like a canvas of potential than a boring workplace safety tool. My first attempt was… well, let's just say it looked like a kindergartener's art project gone wrong. Stick figures with exaggerated hunched backs and comically twisted necks became my initial draft.

**Pro tip:** Don't be afraid to get a bit ridiculous with your design. Humor makes learning more memorable! I decided to personalize my poster with some quirky illustrations: • A sad computer mouse crying from overuse • A chair doing stretching exercises • A keyboard performing an epic superhero pose

The breakthrough came when I started adding real photographs of correct and incorrect postures. Suddenly, my poster wasn't just informative—it was engaging. I used bold colors that would catch someone's eye from across the room, ensuring that no one could ignore my ergonomic masterpiece.

My final design became a conversation starter. Colleagues would stop, laugh, and actually read the information. Who knew a workplace poster could be both educational and entertaining?

## Conclusions
  
  
So there you have it, folks! My journey into the wonderful world of ergonomics has been a bumpy ride, filled with laughs, aches, and plenty of learning. But every adjustment has been worth it. Now it's your turn to create your own awareness ergonomics poster and transform your workspace. Remember, ergonomics isn't about perfection, it's about progress. And who knows, you might just have some fun along the way! Stay ergo-strong!",1,1732666790.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

I'm a DACA recipient who relies in the information from this group to be up to date in the process or current status of our program in the fifth Circuit Court. I also check and cross reference information from United We Dream, Informed Immigrant and other sites. However, today I clicked on one user's comment and checked the user's information, and the comment karma and the post karma numbers were of yesterday. This doesn't always mean that is a bot 100% . In fact, I rarely comment anything so for some people I might be consider a Bot. However,  since some of us are dealing with stress from the coming election, some of us dealing with Advance Parole, upcoming marriages, other ways to get legalized, trying to figure out plan B through Z if the worse happens, or just surviving, on top of the holiday/work/family life stress, please use the cross reference for any advice or comment accross different platforms, do your research with an accredited state bar immigration lawyer, or multiple accredited immigration non-profit organizations in your town/city, look for methods to flag a reddit bot here :https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1d25a46/how\_can\_you\_tell\_if\_a\_reddit\_user\_is\_a\_bot/, and remember to always take care of yourself first. Take care of yourself is easy to say when we have alot of things to deal with or take care of at the same time, but seriously, take some time to enjoy yourself even if it is for a fresh cup of coffee, your favorite movie, favorite piece of clothing, etc. Having a moment of peace, and self reflection provides a better outcome for making decisions, building your network, finding the correct information more effectively, etc. Lastly, everything takes time, maybe even years in the process including some deportation proceedings, or deporting a segment of a group like DACA recipients. This doesn't mean coasting it, but learning to know what to give energy and what not to focus. Always cross reference information and be aware of the energy given or provided. Always.

I'm F33, FA myself. Guy's a severe avoidant (I believe FA but could be DA?), reasons childhood trauma which we share. We didn't date or had anything but some connection was built. 

**>>> context prior to current ghosting but not necessary <<<<**  
He started speaking to me at a workshop, we went for a coffee afterwards and took a walk through the city. He was really sweet, very gentle and shy. Asked me about myself all the time, was really interested in me. Asked for my contact. The other day he texts me a lot, chased me even, immediately asks that he'd like to go with me to a gallery sometimes (common interest). We meet next week, opened a lot about himself, was vulnerable, asked if he can hug me when we parted. Another day I text that I really liked it and would like to meet again (fearful avoidant myself, I suspected I could have built walls so just wanted to make known my interest). Freaks out, delays responses. I anxiously overshare a bit. He ghosts for a day. I overshare a bit again (how I felt safe with him unlike other guys but now I'm insecure when he ghosts, and that I just wanted to get closer to him (i know i know scary)). He overapologises, shares how insecure and afraid he feels with people, recovers from breakup 1,5 yrs ago, needs to go way slower and needs months/years to be sure of spark. I write Understand but here our needs misalign, ended things very softly. He invites me to let him know anyway if I want to go to a gallery. (I did some time later, really just wrote I'd like to if you want to, and he rejected me, citing no spark, feeling pressure for relationship, lots of rational excuses, detached.)

Three months no contact but we met at the workshop that we both attend and he came asking how I am, looked happy to see me, very gentle. When event ends he lingers a while then bolts past me out of the door without saying bye. I had the feeling he scared himself. Next month, he doesn't even say hi and then runs away again. Next month doesn't even show up.  
**>>> context ends <<<**

I sensed he was depressed, lonely and traumatised and has shared worrisome content mental health-wise. One of the reasons I decided to check in on him after 3 months. Wanted him to see I have not discarded him, do not consider him a failure (or whatever we trauma survivors like to say to ourselves) and am still there if he wants to talk (which he said he would miss because I listened and understood him). I also sensed he really cared about me and just freaked out and was afraid, and I couldn't bring myself for 3 months to move on and let it go knowing this (god knows how much I tried).

Gently checked in on him, his answers were guarded and lots of humour as self-protection, didn't share much about himself but asked a lot of questions about me. We exchanged a few longer texts over the week, both taking longer and longer to reply (remember I'm FA too) but at the longest the next day. And here is what I don't understand: I didn't want to drag the conversation, I didn't even ask questions at first, but he kept asking me questions about myself, multiple even (like 3 questions in a row). When my text was longer, he also replied wt a longer text. He even shared paintings he liked at a gallery, just like at the beginnings when he tried to chat me up. IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE WANTS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. But suddenly he ghosts. It's been 5 days, he didn't even view my last text for 3 days (now did but still didn't reply).

I don't understand. I am so angry and disappointed. I wasn't trying to talk him up, I wasn't chasing, I wasn't even overly attached to it. I was fine with just checking in on him (not expecting him to answer truthfully but at least he'd knew someone cares) and exchanging a few texts then saying Bye so glad you're holding on, I'm here if you need to talk. But I feel like he got me dragged into the conversation by asking so many questions, and once he got me there he ghosts me and discards me. (Same pattern happened at the beginning.) I know he's not doing it on purpose, I know he's hurting, but I am still so chafed.

Insight welcome (I know my attachment played a role). But just validation is so welcome too. Thank you guys who've read this. I've felt so alone, I speak with friends & therapist but I'm still so exhausted by this all. <3

PS. Please don't react how avoidants are the worst. They can be but that doesn't help. Plus I am fearful avoidant myself but it would break my heart to ever treat someone with such disrespect and unkindness.",1,1732666204.0,FearfulAvoidants,0,1.0,False

I have noticed that your behaviour is really similar to those that suffer from pornography addiction. I know it might be hard to admit it, but it's clear that you have a problem.

I get that you are young and trying to be edgy, but you'll regret it big time in your mid twenties when you'll get erectile dysfunction.

Most of the time, porn addicts are addicted because of lack of physical intimacy or have a deeper root cause which they need to find first. If it's the latter, You need to look yourself in the eye and ask: ""Why am I doing this? Is this really who I want to be?"".

You could go to the gym, read books, play videogames or do literally anything else other than gooning 24/7. Try anything remotely interesting untill you've found a hobby that suits you.

If you lack physical touch and that's causing you to be in this this downward spiral, you will need to work on yourself so that you're attractive enough for an intimate partner. If you shower daily and wear deodorant and/or perfume already, work on your social skills. You can try befriending your peers. If you have friends already, make sure to spend time with them every week in the real world. After you've mastered your social skills, you can try your luck with a potential romantic partner: ask them out for a coffee date or a walk in the city, but don't expect anything. You can also ask your friends for help with finding you a partner.

If you can't kick your addiction by yourself, seek professional help. They could assist you on your journey. If you can't afford it or think that they don't work, you can also speak to a trusted friend or something.",2,1732666202.0,forsen,2,0.62,False

(Plus new donor bonus money) Using the CSL Plasma app! Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:

I have educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out and earn extra money:

* Plasma is 92% water and the rest is mostly protein elements.

* The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.

* Your body regenerates plasma fast from staying hydrated and eating protein.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait inbetween those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hyrdrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation.
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating.
5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate.
7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening.
10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory.



* Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.
* It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.

* Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma.
* Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement. I also drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.

I'm David, and I've been working as a writing professor for the past six years here in California. I started pretty early, which was a wild ride--and it still is--but it truly is the best job in the world. Other things I enjoy doing are reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, playing volleyball, working out, drinking coffee, watching a movie, playing video games, traveling, cooking, learning something new, or a mix of any of those.

I absolutely love good stories regardless of where they're found, which expands to enjoying meeting and talking to people. When I'm not teaching, I'm talking to students before and after class (often risking being late to my next class!) or meeting with students both current and former and talking about writing, life, and everything in between.

They no longer sell the Plus in that boutique and it's been removed from all their pricing and marketing. And I checked another boutique and they have it high in a shelf where people can barely see it, and said they no longer have them in stock, they're only available online. One of reps said Nespresso is trying to discontinue the Plus and focus more on the Next and Pop+, at least here in Canada, and the only reason they still even have the classic Round Head and Deluxe Flat Head is because people keep buying them and they have less issues than the Plus (particularly with it getting stuck). That's also why all the third party retailers here only sell the Pop and Next now. 

What a strange move. I already got a bad taste with their greedy coffee offers always requiring a min $100 spend and no proper loyalty program, but to hear this too just continues to show Nespresso doesn't really care what customers want, and prioritze their own greedy interests, now to get people to buy more machines with shorter life spans.",2,1732665996.0,nespresso,1,0.75,False

1h0qwyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1h0qwyx/30m_creative_writing_professor_looking_for_new/,[30/M] Creative Writing Professor looking for new connections! [Chat],"Hey!

I'm David, and I've been working as a writing professor for the past six years here in California. I started pretty early, which was a wild ride--and it still is--but it truly is the best job in the world. Other things I enjoy doing are reading, writing, listening to music, playing music, playing volleyball, working out, drinking coffee, watching a movie, playing video games, traveling, cooking, learning something new, or a mix of any of those.

I absolutely love good stories regardless of where they're found, which expands to enjoying meeting and talking to people. When I'm not teaching, I'm talking to students before and after class (often risking being late to my next class!) or meeting with students both current and former and talking about writing, life, and everything in between. It's a lot for an introvert like me, but I'm awful at saying no, and it is one of the aspects I enjoy most about the job.

That's enough about me. I'm trying to keep this shorter than my usual posts, which apparently is a struggle for me. I want to know about you! There's something to be appreciated about the raw honesty and vulnerability of meeting strangers online, so come say hi! Send me a message or chat request, and I don't mind moving to another messaging platform if that's to your preference.",1,1732665931.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
1h0qvta,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1h0qvta/what_coffee_machines_use_k_cups/,What Coffee Machines Use K Cups?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a barista for over 6 years, and I get this question all the time - which coffee machines are compatible with K-cups? I thought I'd share my knowledge since I've tested dozens of machines over the years.

First off, let's clear something up - not all coffee makers can use K-cups. These little pods are specifically designed for Keurig machines and other compatible brewers. After trying countless machines, I've found some real gems that I think you'll love.

Obviously, all Keurig branded machines work with K-cups. The K-Elite is my personal favorite (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine). It's super reliable and makes a perfect cup every time. But there are other brands too!

Here's what you need to know about K-cup compatible machines:

1. Keurig Models:
- K-Classic
- K-Elite
- K-Supreme
- K-Mini
- K-Cafe

2. Other Compatible Brands:
- Mr. Coffee K-cup brewers
- Hamilton Beach FlexBrew
- Cuisinart SS-10
- Mueller Ultimate

Something cool I've discovered is that many of these machines now have features like temperature control and strength settings. This means you can make anything from a mild morning brew to a strong afternoon pick-me-up.

The best part? Most modern K-cup machines are surprisingly affordable. I recently got my mom the K-Elite (https://athometouch.com/coffeemachine), and she absolutely loves how easy it is to use.

Pro Tips from my experience:
- Clean your machine regularly
- Use filtered water for better taste
- Store K-cups in a cool, dry place
- Consider getting a reusable K-cup filter for ground coffee

One thing to watch out for - some cheaper knock-off machines claim to be K-cup compatible but don't work well. Stick with trusted brands for the best results.

Remember, while K-cups are super convenient, they're not the only option. Most of these machines also work with reusable pods that you can fill with your favorite ground coffee. This gives you the best of both worlds - convenience when you want it and flexibility when you need it.

I hope this helps you make an informed decision! Feel free to ask any questions in the comments - I'm always happy to help fellow coffee enthusiasts!",1,1732665843.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1h0qutt,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1h0qutt/is_it_inappropriate_to_ask_if_manager_is/,is it inappropriate to ask if manager is considering firing me,"tldr: is it inappropriate to straight up ask if not attending a meeting (that manager asked me if i could attend but i said i wouldn't want to attend that day due to schedule) will be me at risk for being fired/let go?

i work as a barista at a small indepedent coffee shop, before was nearly full time and now im part time due to my status as a student. 

every 2-3 months we have a 'meeting' with all baristas, manager, and boss to go over seasonal drinks, general cleaning tasks, new systems, etc. in advance my manager allowed me to ask off for 3 weeks for my finals (take classes at two colleges) and for my transfer applications. she was very open to it and told me not to worry at all, as well as i added i could cover one or two shifts if really needed/if someone called out. 

she asked me a few days before if x day is okay for a meeting. i said i strongly preferred not (which i should have said NO) because of my schedule thats she was aware of. she ignored my text and sent an annoucement that the meeting was on that day. i texted her personally if i was expected to attend and she said she would like me to if i can. this felt so ambigious and confusing so i texted again that i didn't feel i could make it without sacrificing my school work. she never responded and we have the meetin schedule in 2 hours. i don't know if i should be getting ready or not. 

again, she hasn't responded so i want to text her asking again for her opinion on me not coming, as well as if not coming puts me at risk for being fired. she recently fired a barista and that barista was in the dark about it so i want to know. i appreiciate communication even if it's straight up or rude, but i know in the work environment there are 'rules'.

Back in May, my husband ordered a surprise (A scarf! Le Cavalier a la Trompette!) for me to pick up at our local store in Chicago. When we went to pick it up I made sure to introduce myself to the SA who helped me, and shared that I'd be interested in my first handbag sometime this year.

In October, I emailed the SA and re-introduced myself and inquired about (1) the I Like Flowers 70 scarf, (2) any cashmere scarves in 140 or 45s, and (3) the possibility of getting a Picotin 18 in Barenia Faubourg, gold, fauve, ebene, or casaque (black and ebene), all with GWH. We sent a few emails back and forth, and then we both went out of town for a few weeks.

I had an early November birthday and wanted to spend it surrounded by beautiful things, so I went in and visited with my SA. I ordered the I Like Flowers and bought some nail polish and an eyelash curler, and inquired about a coffee cup and the Picotin. My SA is a delight; we talked all about the different kinds of leathers, and she even shared with me a wallet made in Volynka leather that was just unreal. We played with scarves and she even pulled a bag out for me to see (an In The Loop in craie, beautiful but not for me). I reiterated what I wanted in a bag and she said she'd work on making it happen. In the meantime, I figured I'd be in touch about scarves and porcelain and keep my fingers crossed for the Picotin.

Well, just two weeks later, she pulled through, and I picked her up on Saturday morning! Apparently she asked her manager to order me one specifically since she had never seen this exact combination before and didn't want to disappoint me. Can you even believe that? It's such a dream come true. I've loved taking her out and about all over town, and I can't wait to see how the leather patinas, deepening over time. 

I did want to see if anyone can speak to the quality of the L'Inserts from 7 Rue Paradis? I ordered one on Amazon to help keep the shape and it's kind of nice to have pockets on the inside but I thought I would check with you experts. I’m so happy my Hermes collection includes leather now! 🤩 ",43,1732665375.0,TheHermesGame,3,0.96,False
1h0qn3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1h0qn3q/tl_dont_read/,TL don’t read,"I began drinking senior year of high school.
I remember hanging out with this girl a lot and I didn’t really like her . I figured I’d share some mikes hard lemonades over it .
I had a fake Id that some of my older friends had given me in order to get into clubs where I would drink under age.
My drinking really took off when I was 18 years old and for the next 20 years, I drank here and there on and off where I could get my hands on some sort of alcohol. I really didn’t think that I had a problem, but my disease got progressively worse.
No one forced me to drink, but alcoholism, was everywhere around me. I must’ve figured good at some point that I was going to keep into peer pressure. I guess I got tired. I mean I was 18 years old. I didn’t even know peer pressure was if I knew then what I know now things would’ve been way different , I don’t know why, but I always seem to find myself in a crowd with older people. They always busted my balls about something. Prom happened and somehow I ended up going to prom with some of the college people from work. I always wanted to be older than I was. I had a boyfriend who was in college figured OK what the heck. I didn’t really know what alcohol was until I drankduring prom. Well after that, it was pretty much off to the races. I discovered alcohol and I was gonna drink it sometimes more sometimes less sometimes in moderation sometimes here sometimes there only a special occasion. Some of my family members drank it . It’s a worldwide disease. I never really really liked alcohol. I just always thought that if I didn’t drink it, I was gonna be ostracized from society, shunned. I don’t blame myself for picking up the first drink. What the fuck that I know i was dumb and young. Life happened for me the way it did . I had no control over my drinking at the time. I seriously thought it was a normal part of life. Come to find out there’s another way about four years ago. I’ve come to realize is acceptance. Addiction comes in many forms shapes and sizes. For example, some days I’m able to eat food and moderation and drink, coffee and moderation and have my cigarette and moderation and other times. It’s like I’m doing everything extra. I can go from high to Lowes small things to big things. It’s like I’ve developed this spectrum of how my brain works. I’m a know it all and I guess part of my alcoholism was like my scientific approach to study like some sort of researcher. The biggest issue in my life right now is my father. I can’t figure him out. We have a good relationship and that I don’t comment is drinking. He doesn’t comment on my smoking cigarettes, alcohol and cigarettes. He has an occasional beer and I’ll have an occasional cigarette. If he sees me cigarettes, more than usual, he’ll definitely comment on it. For that im actually grateful.
I’m not big on AA. I appreciate that from time to time but AA is like a never-ending story, much like this one. I’m just so tired of the disease of alcoholism that I have from my past. It seems to come back and haunt me every now and then. 
Depends on who I talk to I guess.
I don’t consider my father to be an alcoholic like myself he seems perfectly normal and stable to me .
If anything I’m the crazy one .
To be fair , I’m an adult child of alcoholism dysfunction and chaos , of divorced parent and constant stress anxiety and fear .
I love my parents but it’s time to bring back focus onto my recovery again.

Ello ello! My name is Lewis, I'm 29 and from the UK, more specifically the North West.

I'm on the search for someone like minded and just ""gets it"". I'm searching for that connection, that something which just makes you want to fall into things deeper.

I'm interested in getting to know each other on a deeper level, go on dates, have fun and just enjoy life! At this point where I am in my life, I just want to be happy with the person I choose to spend the rest of my life with.

I know what I want from a relationship and I'm not afraid to show it. Someone to be by each others sides through thick and thin, the good and the bad. Who understands you've got to weather the stormy seas to enjoy the good in life.

I work a crazy schedule so I'm available all hours of the day throughout the week.

I value trust and honesty above all else in a relationship. If I can't trust you, what's the point? I'd much rather be hurt than your brutal honesty than your lies and attempts to soften the blow. With that said, I'm not interested in wasting yours or my time. So I'll get it out of the way now that I have a 4 year old child from a previous relationship.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it

Selfie time so you can see my in the flesh: https://imgur.com/a/Z17J0qs

When I leave the house I enjoy exploring, hiking, cycling, swimming, trying new experiences, being in nature and going to gigs/festivals.

- Hiking/cycling - I love being outdoors
- Listening to heavy metal/rock

- Watching documentaries/anime (give me your best, I need some new shit to watch)
- Playing games (PC gamer at heart. Played a lot of OSRS, Minecraft, Rust to name a few).
- Board games (Terraforming Mars, Scythe, D&D, Gloomhaven etc)

I'm also 420 friendly and enjoy partaking in the devils lettuce.

Guy's a severe avoidant (fearful avoidant probably), reasons childhood trauma which we share. We didn't date or had anything but some connection was built. He started speaking to me at a workshop, we went for a coffee afterwards and took a walk through the city. He was really sweet, very gentle and shy. Asked me about myself all the time, was really interested in me. Asked for my contact. The other day he texts me a lot, chased me even, immediately asks that he'd like to go with me to a gallery sometimes (common interest). We meet next week, opened a lot about himself, was vulnerable, asked if he can hug me when we parted. Another day I text that I really liked it and would like to meet again (fearful avoidant myself, I suspected I could have built walls so just wanted to make known my interest). Freaks out, delays responses. I anxiously overshare a bit. He ghosts for a day. I overshare a bit again (how I felt safe with him unlike other guys but now I'm insecure when he ghosts, and that I just wanted to get closer to him (i know i know scary)). He overapologises, shares how insecure and afraid he feels with people, recovers from breakup 1,5 yrs ago, needs to go way slower and needs months/years to be sure of spark. I write Understand but here our needs misalign, ended things very softly. He invites me to let him know anyway if I want to go to a gallery. (I did some time later, really just wrote I'd like to if you want to, and he rejected me, citing no spark, feeling pressure for relationship, lots of rational excuses, detached.)

Three months no contact but we met at the workshop that we both attend and he came asking how I am, looked happy to see me, very gentle. When event ends he lingers a while then bolts past me out of the door without saying bye. I had the feeling he scared himself. Next month, he doesn't even say hi and then runs away again. Next month doesn't even show up. 

I sensed he was depressed, lonely and traumatised and has shared worrisome content mental health-wise. One of the reasons I decided to check in on him after 3 months. Wanted him to see I have not discarded him, do not consider him a failure (or whatever we trauma survivors like to say to ourselves) and am still there if he wants to talk (which he said he would miss because I listened and understood him). I also sensed he really cared about me and just freaked out and was afraid, and I couldn't bring myself for 3 months to move on and let it go knowing this (god knows how much I tried).

Gently checked in on him, his answers were guarded and lots of humour as self-protection, didn't share much about himself but asked a lot of questions about me. We exchanged a few longer texts over the week, both taking longer and longer to reply (remember I'm FA too) but at the longest the next day. And here is what I don't understand: I didn't want to drag the conversation, I didn't even ask questions at first, but he kept asking me questions about myself, multiple even (like 3 questions in a row). When my text was longer, he also replied wt a longer text. He even shared paintings he liked at a gallery, just like at the beginnings when he tried to chat me up. IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE WANTS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. But suddenly he ghosts. It's been 5 days, he didn't even view my last text for 3 days (now did but still didn't reply).

I don't understand. I am so angry and disappointed. I wasn't trying to talk him up, I wasn't chasing, I wasn't even overly attached to it. I was fine with just checking in on him (not expecting him to answer truthfully but at least he'd knew someone cares) and exchanging a few texts then saying Bye so glad you're holding on, I'm here if you need to talk. But I feel like he got me dragged into the conversation by asking so many questions, and once he got me there he ghosts me and discards me. (Same pattern happened at the beginning.) I know he's not doing it on purpose, I know he's hurting, but I am still so chafed.

1h0qelv,https://www.reddit.com/r/granddesigns/comments/1h0qelv/reflective_account_mapping_the_british_museum/,Reflective Account: Mapping the British Museum Journey,"Our group trip to the British Museum was an enlightening exercise in both experience design and creative mapping. As a group of four, we began by discussing logistics in class—settling on a date, choosing our mode of transport, and securing tickets. The ticket-booking process itself set a positive tone for the journey; it was seamless, and the fact that entry was free made the entire experience feel accessible and inviting.

Instead of adhering to a traditional journey map, we opted for an abstract representation that captured not just the timeline but also the emotional ebb and flow of our experience. We divided our map into two halves: **positive** and **negative** experiences, with the **y-axis** representing time. The lines spread outward from a central point, dynamically charting our emotional responses as they evolved throughout the trip.

To add depth, we incorporated **dotted lines** for mapping the **brand experience**—elements directly tied to the British Museum as a brand—and **solid lines** for the broader journey. We used six colour-coded legends to depict distinct aspects of our experience:

1. **Overwhelmed**
2. **Underwhelmed**
3. **Temperature**
4. **Curiosity**
5. **Confusion**
6. **Convenience**

This approach allowed us to reflect on specific moments, like the ease of entering the museum (marked as ""convenience"") or the fascination sparked by certain exhibits (captured under ""curiosity""). Conversely, minor frustrations, such as navigating crowded spaces, were mapped as ""overwhelmed"" in the negative zone.

The abstract map provided a unique lens to analyse our journey, making it visually engaging and insightful. By breaking away from conventional mapping, we were able to focus on the **emotional texture** of our experience rather than just the linear flow of events. This exercise not only highlighted the museum’s ability to evoke curiosity and ease but also pinpointed areas, like crowd management, where improvements could enhance the visitor journey.

Ultimately, our tool proved successful in creating a rich, multi-dimensional reflection on the brand experience and the journey as a whole.

This will be long... I just need to vent here, thanks to everyone who reads this <3 

Guy's a severe avoidant (DA, might be FA), reasons childhood trauma which we share. We didn't date or had anything but some connection was built. He started speaking to me at a workshop, we went for a coffee afterwards and took a walk through the city. He was really sweet, very gentle and shy. Asked me about myself all the time, was really interested in me. Asked for my contact. The other day he texts me a lot, chased me even, immediately asks that he'd like to go with me to a gallery sometimes (common interest). We meet next week, opened a lot about himself, was vulnerable, asked if he can hug me when we parted. Another day I text that I really liked it and would like to meet again (fearful avoidant myself, I suspected I could have built walls so just wanted to make known my interest). Freaks out, delays responses. I anxiously overshare a bit. He ghosts for a day. I overshare a bit again (how I felt safe with him unlike other guys but now I'm insecure when he ghosts, and that I just wanted to get closer to him (i know i know scary)). He overapologises, shares how insecure and afraid he feels with people, recovers from breakup 1,5 yrs ago, needs to go way slower and needs months/years to be sure of spark. I write Understand but here our needs misalign, ended things very softly. He invites me to let him know anyway if I want to go to a gallery. (I did some time later, really just wrote I'd like to if you want to, and he rejected me, citing no spark, feeling pressure for relationship, lots of rational excuses, detached.)

Three months no contact but we met at the workshop that we both attend and he came asking how I am, looked happy to see me, very gentle. When event ends he lingers a while then bolts past me out of the door without saying bye. I had the feeling he scared himself. Next month, he doesn't even say hi and then runs away again. Next month doesn't even show up. 

I sensed he was depressed, lonely and traumatised and has shared worrisome content mental health-wise. One of the reasons I decided to check in on him after 3 months. Wanted him to see I have not discarded him, do not consider him a failure (or whatever we trauma survivors like to say to ourselves) and am still there if he wants to talk (which he said he would miss because I listened and understood him). I also sensed he really cared about me and just freaked out and was afraid, and I couldn't bring myself for 3 months to move on and let it go knowing this (god knows how much I tried).

Gently checked in on him, his answers were guarded and lots of humour as self-protection, didn't share much about himself but asked a lot of questions about me. We exchanged a few longer texts over the week, both taking longer and longer to reply (remember I'm FA too) but at the longest the next day. And here is what I don't understand: I didn't want to drag the conversation, I didn't even ask questions at first, but he kept asking me questions about myself, multiple even (like 3 questions in a row). When my text was longer, he also replied wt a longer text. He even shared paintings he liked at a gallery, just like at the beginnings when he tried to chat me up. IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE WANTS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. But suddenly he ghosts. It's been 5 days, he didn't even view my last text for 3 days (now did but still didn't reply).

I don't understand. I am so angry and disappointed. I wasn't trying to talk him up, I wasn't chasing, I wasn't even overly attached to it. I was fine with just checking in on him (not expecting him to answer truthfully but at least he'd knew someone cares) and exchanging a few texts then saying Bye so glad you're holding on, I'm here if you need to talk. But I feel like he got me dragged into the conversation by asking so many questions, and once he got me there he ghosts me and discards me. (Same pattern happened at the beginning.) I know he's not doing it on purpose, I know he's hurting, but I am still so chafed.

Now, with nearly 15,000 holders—four times the number at its previous all-time high of $300 million—$KENDU is stronger and more prepared than ever to ride the wave of an imminent bull market.

This move doesn’t just expand access—it positions Kendu Inu as a top contender in cross-chain innovation.

On top of that, Kendu’s reach is extending far beyond crypto. With energy drinks, coffee, nightclub events, and other lifestyle initiatives, it’s making waves in the real world, creating a connection that resonates with investors and everyday enthusiasts alike.

1h0q70m,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1h0q70m/how_common_is_it_for_people_to_end_up/,"How common is it for people to end up marrying/living together not out of love or attraction, but out of convenience or fear of being alone?","Pretty much what the title says. I'm 28 and have been single by choice since I was 25.  While I've grabbed the occasional drink or coffee with people here and there, I ultimately don't date seriously and take things further unless I'm absolutely head over heels with someone whose presence and company I genuinely enjoy, which, I'll be perfectly honest, hasn't happened in a while.

Over the last few years, I met two or three people who had the potential to be great partners, meaning they had a plethora of great qualities and we shared tons of goals, morals, and principles, plus they showed genuine interest in me but I just wasn't *into* them like that. As I approach my thirties, still single, I've begun questioning whether or not I made a mistake by letting these people pass instead of giving them a chance even though I wasn't that attracted to them. I've begun wondering if people reach a point in which they just... Conform?

Are people just like ""Okay I don't really like this guy that much but he's decent and he pays half the rent and I'll never find someone better so he'll have to do""? ""This girl is not that nice but she would make a good mother so I'll marry her?"" Because that sounds nightmarish to me, but now I'm starting to think that maybe my idea of love and relationships is just not realistic because finding someone who is not only nice, kind and mature and has similar goals to mine but whom I also feel romatically/sexually attracted to is starting to sound like romcom stuff.

Edit: Just wanna add that when I say I've not reciprocated people in the past because ""I'm not into them"", it has nothing at all to do with physical appearance. This is not a case of ""Ah, he's really nice but he's too short or he's ugly"". It's just that in most cases I can recognize someone's great partner material, but I don't feel inclined to like flirt, or have zero desire to have anything more than a friendship.",8,1732663896.0,AskWomenOver30,9,0.79,False

And I don’t know what to do now.,"This is my life story. Names changed for privacy. Any advice would be appreciated. this is my life, i not a writer, im an architect student. this isnt fiction. 

Part 1: The Turning Point with Layla

My relationship with my younger sister, Layla, took a dark turn around early 2020. I was 20, and she was 16. Up until then, things were relatively normal between us, but it felt like something shifted in her almost overnight. Her behavior became erratic, harmful, and unpredictable. I’ve often wondered if she experienced some sort of trauma that she hasn’t shared, but whatever the root cause, she began directing her frustration and anger toward me.

Layla started invading my privacy in ways that left me feeling violated and helpless. She would steal my belongings—sometimes blatantly—and go through my things without hesitation. What made it even more infuriating was that she blamed my mom for her actions, as if to deflect responsibility. One particular incident that stands out is when she began taking my expensive perfumes. I had already given her permission to use them because I wanted to avoid unnecessary conflict, but it seemed like she took advantage of my generosity just to spite me.

To protect my belongings, I installed a lock on my door. Even then, I made the mistake of trusting her enough to share the code, not realizing she was the very person I needed protection from. Her behavior escalated in ways that made me feel powerless. She began taking my clothes—especially the ones my mom disapproved of, like crop tops and jeans—and either wearing them herself or destroying them. One time, she cut my jeans into shorts and tried to claim that I’d given them to her like that. Confronting my mom about these incidents wasn’t an option because I knew I’d get in trouble for owning those items in the first place.

The situation with Layla spilled over into other aspects of my life. During COVID, my older sister Mariam and I started a dessert business. It was something we were both passionate about and a rare bright spot in a dark time. We stayed up countless nights perfecting recipes and creating desserts, and the business was thriving. But Layla found a way to ruin that too. She began deliberately breaking the desserts we worked so hard to make, sometimes right before we were about to deliver them. Her actions were so disruptive that we had to shut the business down entirely. It wasn’t just about the loss of income; it felt like she was sabotaging one of the few things I was proud of.

Our home life became unbearable. The constant tension led to explosive fights almost every night. Mariam and I tried to make our parents see what Layla was doing, but they dismissed it. They didn’t take her actions seriously or hold her accountable, which left me feeling completely unsupported. Every evening seemed to end with us yelling in the living room, desperately trying to be heard, but the situation never improved.

The fights reached a boiling point, and eventually, both Mariam and I were kicked out of the house. Looking back, I can’t help but feel that Layla’s behavior was the catalyst for everything falling apart. The experience left me deeply hurt, frustrated, and disillusioned with my family.

Part 2: A Family in Crisis

Toward the end of 2020, things took an even darker turn. One night, my dad appeared to have a medical emergency. It seemed like a heart attack or seizure—his body was convulsing, he was foaming at the mouth, and he was struggling to breathe. Mariam and I ran downstairs to find my mom, Layla, and my brother, Adam, just sitting there, watching him as if they were in a trance. They hadn’t called an ambulance.

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. For what must have been five minutes, they just watched him suffer. Mariam and I immediately sprang into action, calling for help while the rest of my family stood by and did nothing. It was surreal and deeply unsettling to witness their indifference during such a critical moment.

You’d think this event would have been a wake-up call for our family, a moment to put our differences aside and come together. But that didn’t happen. The fights continued as if nothing had changed.

Part 3: Becoming the Black Sheep

Not long after, I finally managed to buy a car. It felt like a small victory, a sign that things might start looking up. For a brief moment, I allowed myself to feel hopeful.

But my family has always had a way of pulling me back into the chaos. I’ve been branded as the black sheep for as long as I can remember, even as a child. Whenever fights broke out, I was the one blamed, regardless of the circumstances. It didn’t matter who started it or what the issue was; the conclusion was always the same—I was the problem.

This dynamic has left me feeling isolated and misunderstood. It’s as though no matter how hard I try to navigate these relationships or prove my worth, I’ll always be seen through this distorted lens.

Part 4: Running Away to Turkey

In early 2021, I turned 21, but my life was anything but celebratory. The constant fighting at home had become unbearable. Every day felt like a battle, and I reached a breaking point. Desperate for peace, I decided to run away to Turkey, hoping to escape the chaos and find some semblance of calm. I stayed there for five months, but my time in Turkey brought its own set of challenges—ones that were deeply traumatic and left lasting scars.

Back home, Layla’s behavior only worsened in my absence. She continued her destructive patterns, cutting the cord to an expensive coffee machine we had and breaking Mariam’s laptop. My dad’s health also took a turn for the worse again, and even though I was miles away, the dysfunction I had tried to leave behind still loomed over me. I couldn’t help but feel responsible, blaming Layla for forcing me into this position.

While I was in Turkey, things went from bad to worse. I found myself in incredibly dangerous situations where I was nearly raped and attacked multiple times. The fear and helplessness I experienced during those moments were overwhelming. I kept thinking about how none of this would have happened if Layla hadn’t made home life so unbearable that I felt I had no choice but to leave.

The emotional toll of Turkey didn’t end there. The worst part of my time away was discovering that my mom, the person who should have been my greatest source of love and support, had been going around wishing and praying for my death. Hearing this crushed me. It confirmed all the feelings of rejection and abandonment I’d carried for years.

As if things couldn’t get more complicated, I was also robbed of $2,000 by a girl who pretended to be my friend. She gained my trust, only to betray me in one of the most vulnerable periods of my life. After robbing me, she went a step further and messaged inappropriate things to my friends—and even to my dad. It was humiliating and horrifying, adding another layer of betrayal to an already unbearable situation.

Despite the chaos, I made one decision for myself during that time: I got a nose job while I was there. It was one of the few things I did that felt like it was for me and no one else, though it didn’t make up for the rest of the hardships I endured.

By the time I returned from Turkey, my PTSD and anxiety were at an all-time high. The weight of what I’d experienced—both back home and during my time away—was suffocating. I came back not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I had nowhere else to go. Turkey was supposed to be my escape, but it turned into another nightmare that left me even more broken than before.

Part 5: The Continued Trauma of 2022

By 2022, the chaos in my life persisted, dominated by Layla’s relentless harassment, theft, and physical abuse. Her behavior had reached a point where I couldn’t find a single moment of peace. Adding to this already unbearable situation, my older sister, Mariam, went through a traumatic breakup with her boyfriend of five years in February. Although they reconciled after just a week, the emotional fallout from the breakup created a new layer of turmoil in my life.

The Dynamic with Mariam

During this time, I found myself taking on an overwhelming amount of responsibility in our shared household. I cooked every meal for both Mariam and me, and her only job was to wash the dishes afterward. But more often than not, she wouldn’t clean up, leaving the dishes to pile up and the house in chaos. This neglect escalated the already tense atmosphere in our family. My mom, rather than holding Mariam accountable, would pray for bad things to happen to both of us, directing her anger at me as though I were to blame for everything.

Mariam, still dealing with her own emotional pain from her relationship struggles, took her frustration out on me. It felt like I was a punching bag for everyone’s rage. To make things worse, Mariam frequently found ways to waste my money, often in thoughtless or careless ways.

One recurring issue was the laundry. Mariam ruined countless clothes by bleaching them or handling them irresponsibly. I took on almost all the household responsibilities—I cared for the cat, did the laundry, cleaned the house, and cooked—but it never seemed enough. Every task I completed was overshadowed by her careless actions, which drained both my energy and my finances.

The breaking point came after a series of escalating conflicts. We had gone on a vacation together earlier that year, but two days into the trip, Mariam decided she wanted to go home. It was an infuriating waste of money and effort, and I felt completely disrespected. Later, a seemingly small incident pushed me over the edge: Mariam told me the wrong date for a Sephora return, which led me to believe I had lost an additional $400. I was at work when I realized what happened, and in my frustration, I texted her to get out of the house.

Mariam had already signed a lease for a new place, with her move-in date just a month away, but she hadn’t told our parents about her plans. She used my text as an excuse to paint the narrative that I had kicked her out of the house, even though it wasn’t my house to begin with. This marked the point of no return in our relationship. The resentment, misunderstandings, and constant financial strain had piled up to a breaking point.

The Vancouver Trip

In October 2022, Mariam and I attempted to salvage our relationship by going on another trip together, this time to Vancouver. But instead of healing, the trip brought more tension. Mariam’s financial problems meant she couldn’t afford to do much on the trip, which made everything feel strained. On top of that, she spent much of the trip crying over her boyfriend, who she was still having constant problems with.

It felt like history repeating itself: why agree to go on a vacation if you’re just going to spend it upset and unable to enjoy anything? I couldn’t help but feel that, once again, my money and effort were being wasted. The trip, instead of bringing us closer, only deepened the resentment between us.

The Breaking Point with Layla

In December 2022, Layla’s behavior escalated to outright violence. One day, she hit me out of nowhere. It wasn’t just a random act of aggression; it was the culmination of years of abuse and torment. I was shaken, angry, and exhausted. I finally realized that I couldn’t take it anymore.

I called Mariam, desperate for support, but her closeness to Layla felt like the ultimate betrayal. How could she stay so close to someone who had repeatedly assaulted me and made my life a living hell? That was the moment I decided to cut Mariam off completely. Her refusal to acknowledge the impact of Layla’s abuse, combined with her own treatment of me, was too much to bear.

This year was a breaking point in so many ways—emotionally, financially, and physically. The relationships I once hoped would provide me with comfort and stability became sources of pain and exhaustion. Cutting ties with Mariam felt like a necessary step for my own survival, even if it was heartbreaking. My world felt smaller and lonelier, but I knew I couldn’t keep sacrificing my well-being for people who didn’t value me.

Part 6: Isolation and Uneasy Reconciliations

By December 2022, the isolation in my family dynamics became even more pronounced. Mariam constantly invited everyone—our cousins, mutual friends, and family—over to her house. I, however, was never invited. This exclusion created a deep sense of loneliness and alienation. I felt disconnected from the people I cared about, as they naturally gravitated to Mariam’s space.

When I tried to bridge the gap by inviting people over to my house, it rarely worked out. Mariam would often show up despite the tension between us, making the gatherings uncomfortable. I’d spend time and money preparing food, hoping to foster connection, only to feel undermined by her presence. It left me questioning why I even bothered.

Part 7: A Shared Breakup and a Fragile Bond

In February 2023, Mariam and I both experienced breakups within days of each other. It was an unexpected turning point. The shared heartbreak brought us closer together. We found solace in each other’s company, leaning on one another in a way we hadn’t in years.

For a time, things felt okay between us. Despite the underlying tension and unresolved issues, there was a sense of camaraderie born out of mutual pain.

Part 8: A Summer of Respite

The summer of 2023 provided a rare break from the usual chaos. Layla, my mom, and my youngest sister, Amal, went away for the entire summer. Their absence brought some much-needed relief, but it didn’t eliminate all the tension.

Even from a distance, Layla continued to stir up conflict. She would make incendiary comments in the family group chat, often targeting me. My brother, Adam, and Amal would join in, piling on and turning every conversation into an attack. When I defended myself, I was painted as the bad person, the instigator, even though I was simply standing up for myself.

Despite these challenges, Mariam and I maintained a good relationship over the summer. There was still some lingering resentment on both sides—remnants of past conflicts—but we managed to keep things civil, even though we bickered occasionally.

Part 9: A Tumultuous Fall

By November 2023, Layla’s behavior escalated again. She became physically violent toward me once more, a painful reminder that little had changed. The cycle of abuse felt never-ending, and I couldn’t see a way out of it.

At the same time, my relationship with Mariam remained relatively stable. We weren’t as close as we had been after our breakups, but we were okay—cordial, if not completely harmonious.

Part 10: Overwhelmed by Everyone

By this time, I was in a committed relationship, which provided a glimmer of stability amidst the chaos. But other dynamics in my life were becoming overwhelming.

With everything happening in the world, my cousins and I became deeply trauma-bonded. They started coming over to my house constantly—so often that it felt like they were there 24/7. While I cherished the connection we shared, it came with its own challenges.

I found myself cooking and cleaning for everyone, providing meals and hospitality without any acknowledgment or gratitude. Every visit felt like a drain on my resources—emotional, physical, and financial. I was paying for everyone’s food, cleaning up after them, and putting in effort that no one seemed to notice. It left me feeling unappreciated and exhausted.

Part 11: Summer 2024 – The Cottage Trip

In the summer of 2024, all my girl cousins, my sisters, and I went to a cottage together. At first, I thought it would be a fun, relaxing getaway, but it quickly became one of the most frustrating experiences of my life.

By default, I became the chef for the entire group—nine people in total. Every single meal was my responsibility. I cooked, cleaned, and handled everything while everyone else lounged around. No one offered to help, and when I asked for assistance, I was met with dismissive shrugs or disrespectful “pfft” responses.

The tension kept building throughout the trip. It was clear that I was being taken advantage of, and I was fuming. It wasn’t just the cooking and cleaning; I had also done the bulk of the grocery shopping for the trip, which was another burden that no one else had really stepped up to share. Only Noor, Tasnim, and Dania, my cousins, helped in small ways, but even their efforts couldn’t offset the overwhelming workload.

The Garden Party

One of the biggest highlights—or what should have been the highlight—of the trip was a dinner party Noor and I planned called the Garden Party. I had spent weeks preparing for it, putting in so much effort to make it special. I bought decorations, fresh flowers, and thrifted unique pieces to create the perfect ambiance. I spent hours cooking multiple dishes and even did everyone’s hair and makeup to ensure they felt as elegant as the setting I had created.

From the beginning, Mariam made it clear that she didn’t care about the party. She didn’t want to spend extra money on it and showed zero interest in the event. I accepted that, but I couldn’t have predicted how her attitude would escalate once the party began.

When the dinner started, Noor and I wanted to take pictures with the setup we had worked so hard on. It was only natural—we had planned the entire thing, and we wanted to capture the beautiful results of our efforts. We spent just a few minutes snapping some cute photos.

Despite her earlier indifference, Mariam suddenly threw a tantrum about not getting any good pictures of herself. She complained that the photos of her were blurry or unflattering and made a huge scene. Her outburst ruined the mood of the party. It wasn’t just frustrating—it was devastating.

Mariam’s tantrum turned something that was supposed to be meaningful and joyful into a selfish spectacle. She had openly said she didn’t care about the party, yet she hijacked the moment and made it all about her. To make matters worse, her outburst left me with just a few blurry, rushed photos of myself, taken in the span of five minutes, while she demanded more attention for her pictures.

The Aftermath

By the time the cottage trip was over, I was livid. I couldn’t stop thinking about how much time, money, and effort I had poured into making the trip and the Garden Party special, only for it to be completely ruined.

No one thanked me for the meals, the planning, or the countless hours I spent trying to make everything perfect. Instead, I was treated like an unpaid servant, and the people I cared about acted like spoiled brats. Mariam’s behavior during the party was the final straw—it felt like a slap in the face after all the work I had done.

Looking back, this trip left me feeling used, unappreciated, and disrespected. What should have been a cherished memory turned into yet another reminder of how much I give to the people around me, only to have it go unnoticed or taken for granted.

Part 12: The Fallout After the Cottage

Following the cottage trip in June 2024, my relationship with Mariam hit an all-time low. We didn’t speak for a month or two after the trip—I was so angry at her for ruining the Garden Party and, by extension, the entire experience for me. My frustration ran deep, and the silence between us felt necessary for me to process everything. Meanwhile, my tension with Layla only escalated, adding to the turmoil in my life.

Mariam’s Short-Lived Relationship and My Solo Trip

By late August, Mariam found herself in the throes of another breakup. She had been in a short two-month relationship with a guy who was clearly still in love with his ex. The situation left her emotionally shattered. Her anxiety and depression from the breakup were so severe that she lost over 10 pounds.

At the same time, I had my own struggles and decided to take a solo trip to Oregon. I needed space—not just from Mariam but from everything happening at home. While I couldn’t be there for her in person during this difficult time, I wanted to make sure she felt supported. I asked my boyfriend to check in on her, call her, and be there for her as much as he could in my absence.

Zuzu’s Health Declines

While dealing with Mariam’s breakup from afar, I was also facing a heartbreaking situation with Zuzu. By the end of July, Zuzu began having serious health problems, which worsened in early August, necessitating surgery. Even after the surgery, she wasn’t doing well, and I found myself constantly monitoring her condition—checking on her almost ten times an hour to ensure she was okay.

What made this even harder was Layla’s abusive behavior toward Zuzu. She went out of her way to make the environment uncomfortable and unsafe for her. Layla would turn the room freezing cold, even when she wasn’t there, seemingly just to “freeze out” Zuzu. It was cruel and infuriating, and it added another layer of stress to an already overwhelming situation.

Part 13: The Breaking Point

In October 2024, Layla’s violence escalated to an unimaginable level. She completely lost control, attacking me and leaving deep cuts all over my neck. I was in shock and utterly distraught, my body physically marked by her cruelty and my spirit crushed by the emotional weight of the situation

Part 13: The Breaking Point (continued)

Desperate for support, I called Nina, someone I had always trusted and considered a pillar of support. Initially, she listened as I cried and poured out my feelings, but within minutes, it felt as though she stopped believing me. Despite being able to see the cuts on my neck, her demeanor shifted, and she began questioning the severity of what I was telling her. The experience left me feeling gaslit, as though my pain and trauma weren’t valid.

Seeking solace elsewhere, I called Mariam, furious and broken. I yelled at her, telling her I couldn’t keep speaking to her if she continued to remain close to Layla. Her alliance with someone who had caused me so much pain felt like the ultimate betrayal. I told her she had to make a choice: stand with me or with Layla. She refused to respond definitively, leaving me even more devastated.

November 14: The Birthday Dinner

As Layla’s birthday dinner approached on November 15, it became yet another point of contention. The chosen restaurant was one I loved and had been planning to visit with my cousins for months. I asked them not to go to this specific place, explaining that I couldn’t afford to go again if they did, as it would ruin the experience for me. My request was misunderstood—they thought I was asking them not to celebrate Layla’s birthday at all.

The situation spiraled out of control in our group chat. Nina, Mariam, and Tara immediately jumped to Layla’s defense, downplaying my concerns and making me feel like I was overreacting. Their defense of her felt like a direct invalidation of everything I had endured. Overwhelmed with frustration and disbelief, I left the group chat.

The Call with Nina

After leaving the chat, Nina called me, and I broke down. I begged her to acknowledge how terrible Layla had been—not just to me, but in general. While Nina admitted that Layla’s actions toward me were horrible, she refused to say that Layla was a horrible person. Her reasoning was that if she labeled Layla as such but still chose to hang out with her, it would make her feel fake or fraudulent.

Her logic devastated me. I couldn’t understand how someone who claimed to care about me could still choose to stand by Layla. I told Nina exactly how I felt—that her actions were phony and hypocritical. How could I trust someone who wouldn’t stand firmly by my side? This realization left me questioning the depth of our relationship.

In a final act of severing trust, I removed Nina from being able to see my location.

November 15: The Birthday Dinner

The next day, Layla’s birthday dinner went ahead as planned. Mariam went all out, even getting her a custom cake. Seeing their celebration wasn’t just painful—it was deeply symbolic of how little my suffering mattered to them.

Adding to the sting, Mariam moved a family gathering that was originally supposed to happen at my parents’ house to her own place. It was a calculated decision, one that excluded me entirely, knowing I wouldn’t be invited. The deliberate nature of these actions left me feeling more isolated than ever.

November 17: The Gathering

Tonight, as Mariam hosts this gathering at her house, I feel nothing but betrayal. Everyone who I had supported—cooking for them, hosting them, being there for them—is at her house, laughing and spending time together, while I’m left out entirely.

They’ve shown me time and again that they will side with Layla, dismissing the years of abuse and torment she has inflicted on me. It’s a profound and painful realization: my pain, my voice, my presence—they don’t matter to the people I once considered my closest circle.

Reflection

For me, this situation is black and white: you cannot stay neutral. If my cousins and Mariam choose to remain close to Layla, they cannot remain close to me. The years of torment, violence, and pain Layla has caused me are too severe to ignore. Their refusal to choose, or even acknowledge the depth of my suffering, is a betrayal I cannot overlook.

Right now, I feel like I’ve lost everything—my family, my cousins, my friends. The people I’ve given so much to have let me down in the most profound way. I am alone, and the heartbreak of their betrayal feels heavier than I ever thought possible",1,1732663833.0,toxicfamilyislam,0,1.0,False

1h0q41j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1h0q41j/ghosted_by_avoidant_after_he_asked_many_questions/,Ghosted by avoidant after he asked many questions in text,"I'm so tired and angry and disappointed... This will be long... I just need to vent here, thanks to everyone who reads this <3 

Guy's a severe avoidant, reasons childhood trauma which we share. We didn't date or had anything but some connection was built. He started speaking to me at a workshop, we went for a coffee afterwards and took a walk through the city. He was really sweet, very gentle and shy. Asked me about myself all the time, was really interested in me. Asked for my contact. The other day he texts me a lot, chased me even, immediately asks that he'd like to go with me to a gallery sometimes (common interest). We meet next week, opened a lot about himself, was vulnerable, asked if he can hug me when we parted. Another day I text that I really liked it and would like to meet again (fearful avoidant myself, I suspected I could have built walls so just wanted to make known my interest). Freaks out, delays responses. I anxiously overshare a bit. He ghosts for a day. I overshare a bit again (how I felt safe with him unlike other guys but now I'm insecure when he ghosts, and that I just wanted to get closer to him (i know i know scary)). He overapologises, shares how insecure and afraid he feels with people, recovers from breakup 1,5 yrs ago, needs to go way slower and needs months/years to be sure of spark. I write Understand but here our needs misalign, ended things very softly. He invites me to let him know anyway if I want to go to a gallery. (I did some time later, really just wrote I'd like to if you want to, and he rejected me, citing no spark, feeling pressure for relationship, lots of rational excuses, detached.)

Three months no contact but we met at the workshop that we both attend and he came asking how I am, looked happy to see me, very gentle. When event ends he lingers a while then bolts past me out of the door without saying bye. I had the feeling he scared himself. Next month, he doesn't even say hi and then runs away again. Next month doesn't even show up. 

I sensed he was depressed, lonely and traumatised and has shared worrisome content mental health-wise. One of the reasons I decided to check in on him after 3 months. Wanted him to see I have not discarded him, do not consider him a failure (or whatever we trauma survivors like to say to ourselves) and am still there if he wants to talk (which he said he would miss because I listened and understood him). I also sensed he really cared about me and just freaked out and was afraid, and I couldn't bring myself for 3 months to move on and let it go knowing this (god knows how much I tried).

Gently checked in on him, his answers were guarded and lots of humour as self-protection, didn't share much about himself but asked a lot of questions about me. We exchanged a few longer texts over the week, both taking longer and longer to reply (remember I'm FA too) but at the longest the next day. And here is what I don't understand: I didn't want to drag the conversation, I didn't even ask questions at first, but he kept asking me questions about myself, multiple even (like 3 questions in a row). When my text was longer, he also replied wt a longer text. He even shared paintings he liked at a gallery, just like at the beginnings when he tried to chat me up. IT REALLY FELT LIKE HE WANTS TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. But suddenly he ghosts. It's been 5 days, he didn't even view my last text for 3 days (now did but still didn't reply).

I don't understand. I am so angry and disappointed. I wasn't trying to talk him up, I wasn't chasing, I wasn't even overly attached to it. I was fine with just checking in on him (not expecting him to answer truthfully but at least he'd knew someone cares) and exchanging a few texts then saying Bye so glad you're holding on, I'm here if you need to talk. But I feel like he got me dragged into the conversation by asking so many questions, and once he got me there he ghosts me and discards me. (Same pattern happened at the beginning.) I know he's not doing it on purpose, I know he's hurting, but I am still so chafed. 

Insight welcome (I know my attachment played a role). But just validation is so welcome too. Thank you guys who've read this. I've felt so alone, I speak with friends & therapist but I'm still so exhausted by this all. <3   
  
PS. Please don't react how avoidants are the worst. They can be but that doesn't help. Plus I am fearful avoidant myself but it would break my heart to ever treat someone with such disrespect and unkindness.",2,1732663675.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

'Tis the Christmas and holiday season, and I come to you as a lowly layperson who knows nothing about pottery. I do, however, have a friend that I love very much who loves pottery, and I'd like to get him a gift that doesn't suck. I've scoured this sub for the last hour (ok, ok, some of that was snacks and coffee time) and have decided on an apron.

Is it fancy material? Canvas, twill, 100% cotton... Is it pockets? 2, 4, 8...is more better? Do you like those aprons that wrap around your legs and secure in back (I think someone called them walking aprons)? Should I look for ones that have leather reinforcing?? Is there a brand you like? Is wash-ability a factor?

  
So yeah, tell me about all things apron and your preferences. Feel free to rant, rave, or wax poetic.

Excited for the meat, but also for the duck fat by-product. I’ve read here a number of views on how to smoke the bird, and feel confident that won’t be an issue. But I’ve been warned that there will be a good deal of duck fat and I want to capture and use that as best I can.

I’ll be using a pellet smoker (Recteq, specifically). I’ve cleaned it out, lined the drip pan with fresh foil, and thoroughly washed the bucket.

My question is, once I have the duck fat, are there any additional steps I should take (such as filtering it through, say, a coffee filter) before using for other purposes? And also, what’s the shelf life for the rendered duck fat? Is there anything I should be doing to extend the shelf life?

I’m thrilled to report that I’ve scored another unicorn: [an unsprayed, 100-ml bottle of OG Yohji Homme](https://imgur.com/a/zwMK0n8). Launched in 1999 by Japanese fashion house Yohji Yamamoto, when its fragrances were still under the Jean Patou label, it was designed by nose Jean-Michel Duriez, probably with support from legendary Patou in-house perfumer Jean Kerleo. Yohji Homme attained mythical status and a cult following in the early 2000s, later cemented by Luca Turin’s rave, five-star review in his first Guide with Tania Sanchez (2008).

Honestly, the juice is pretty freaking incredible. I haven’t been able to stop sniffing it since I got it a few days ago (I’ve worn it twice at night, once for a formal dinner and once before bedtime). Today’s my first full-day run with it. It has a complex, three-part structure consisting of 1) an anisic fougère that lightly treads on 2) gourmand territory and ends on 3) a dark, chypre-like base. The first time I smelled the opening it reminded me distantly of Davidoff Zino and Azzaro Pour Homme — the former, due to the lavender-rosewood; the latter, because of the lavender-anise. But all reminiscences end immediately, as Yohji begins to unfurl its secrets and take an utterly unique path toward an unexpected destination.

After the initial aromatic burst featuring bergamot, lavender, anise, and coriander, it gains in depth and warmth with cinnamon, a more prominent rosewood, and a delicious licorice accord that functions as the pivot to transition from fougère to gourmand. I can discern geranium (or is it carnation?), but whatever florals are present are subtle and quickly subsumed by the irruption of its base protagonists, the real stars of the show: a boozy rum that takes you for a spin, a rich coffee that provides sturdy comfort (and prevents a hangover) and a fine grain, worn-in, brown leather that is only slightly sweetened by high-quality tonka beans and a creamy sandalwood. Heaven.

Yohji Homme was a pioneer and is the perfect gourmand for those of us who don’t usually like gourmands. It’s merely gestural in this regard, in no way evoking anything truly edible. Rum and coffee: two of the best aromas in the world, especially to someone from Guatemala, like me. I have now found my holiday season holy grail: light, fresh, spicy, warm, boozy, semisweet, suave, inviting, and effortlessly interesting. No wonder it’s a legend.",2,1732662852.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

1h0pri7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h0pri7/aita_for_wanting_to_be_paid_back/,AITA for wanting to be paid back?,"My (32F) partner (29M) of 3 years has continually needed financial help from me. It started when we first began dating. 

He had a full time job, earning plenty of money. I was unemployed, caring for my mother who had cancer (unfortunately she passed last year).

It was things like uber eats, concert tickets for bands he loved, groceries.. ""Can you please cover this, and I will send you the money when I get paid?"" 

Every loan i have given him, has only been agreed upon, AFTER he tells me when he will pay me back. 
It just doesn't happen. 
It's at $9000 now. 
Every time I bring it up, he gets very angry and defensive. He can't or won't explain where all of his money goes. 

He doesnt have many bills at all. He pays a small portion of weekly rent, petrol, coffee and cigarettes.
His mother pays for his car & health insurance, car registration, his phone bill, all his medical expenses and more. (I only learned this info a year ago.)

I pay for all of the groceries which is at least $200 per week. I prepare all of his meals, even pack his lunch for work everyday. 
I do all of his laundry and general cleaning. I provide toiletries, hair products etc. 

It's a huge deal for him to just take the bins 10 metres down the driveway onto the street for the weekly pick up... Not to mention putting his dirty clothes in the wash basket, or wiping the mud his boots left on the floor. It feels like asking for him to cut off his nuts.

We have a holiday booked and the flights were kindly gifted by my step father for our combined bday and xmas gift. 
This was booked back in April. 
He was supposed to be saving as much money as possible over these past 7 months, so that we could go halves in the accomodation and travel insurance. Plus have his own spending money.
 
It's all booked now, but he hasn't paid a cent. 
I asked him last night what day suits him to go to the currency exchange to get our foreign cash... 
He got angry again and admitted he doesnt have much money.. I tried asking what that means, like $5? Or $1000?. 
He wouldn't tell me. 
But said his mum will be giving him money for it.... 
He still has a full time job, with what he spends his money on, he should be able to save AT LEAST $400 PER WEEK.

So, where is it?

I just don't understand how a man can live with himself, knowing he owes his woman so much money. 
Wouldnt you feel embarrassed or guilty? Especially looking me in the face Every day? Every time you buy anything? I would.

Any time I have needed a loan when I was younger, I would sacrifice anything non-essential so that I could pay them back ASAP. That's how I was raised.

It's not like I'm ripping him off or asking him for money he didnt know was a loan. Every time I make sure to triple confirm that this is a loan and he will pay me back by X date. 
Each new time, after he hasn't paid the previous amount, I get firmer with the agreement that its a loan, and that i am very unhappy about him promising this in the past and not sticking to his word. He always apologises and promises more. 

Side note: I have a disability that doesn't allow me to work. So I get a small welfare payment, literally less than half of what he makes per week. 

I am exhausted and lost. I cannot afford to not get this money back. It's my life savings and my safety net. I don't know what to do anymore.

I have brought it up to his mother and she practically laughed at me saying ""he has promised to pay me back at least 50k in loans that I know I'll never see"" 
She didn't even care that her son is out in the world doing this to her and others. ",1,1732662722.0,AITAH,2,0.67,False

14:59.

Even though the time on her phone remains unchanged, she checks it again. She knows it won't make the clock move faster, but's she much too eager for tonight's events to leave it be. *Still a minute from 3*. She sighs and looks back up at the projected screen, the Blu-ray playing some dry lecture about MRSI. She can already hear her fellow vigilantes chiding her for her impatience. Suzumi can't help it, thought. Not today. Because today, she's working as Sensei's assistant at SCHALE during the night shift and she can't help but look forward to it. Sure, there'll some work to do; probably two to three hours of catching up on paperwork and miscellaneous administrative duties, but the rest?

The rest will be theirs to do with as they please.

Just thinking about all the *lovely things* they might do tonight makes her wing flap a bit in excitement and her halo glow just a little brighter. *He's been so good to me this past month*, she thinks as she sneaks another look at her phone, the digits still unmoving. *I wish I'd confessed sooner.* No point in beating herself over a past regret. *Especially one that's bee-*

BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP

*Finally!*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trinity was known in Kivotos for many things: religion, tea, artillery, immaculately detailed stained glass artwork, bullpup rifles of questionable quality and beautiful architecture. The religious school was also well know for the rampant sugar addiction suffered by most of their student body. As such, sweet shops, bakeries, ice cream parlors, and patisseries were ubiquitous. More than once, Suzumi had joked with another vigilante about how if you threw a grenade in Trinity, it would bounce off the walls of five bakeries and go through the front window of a sixth.

All that being said, she couldn't really make fun of them too much. They were common enough to where you were never more than a ten minute walk from one, sold fresh baked food and strong tea (or coffee) at a fairly cheap price, and could be found open at a wide variety of odd hours. A few of them donated arms, munitions, or even funds to the vigilantes as thanks for keeping the thugs and delinquents at bay. (Unofficially, of course.)

It's in one of these bakeries that Suzumi finds herself, waiting in line to pick an order she placed after patrolling this morning. The place is lively enough where there's a decently-sized line at the front counter, but sedate enough that the volume never gets above that of a few people having conversations. *This place is really cozy. I really should come back when I'm on patrol for this area again. Or if me and Sensei have some free time,* a light shade of pink staining her cheeks as she once again thinks about him.

The line moves surprisingly fast and before she knows it she's at the front, conversing with the blonde first-year behind the register about her order. ""These are some mighty pricey pastries,"" the cashier remarks while retrieving her order. ""Mind if I ask if you're buying these for someone?"" ""How observant,"" she replies while handing over her payment. ""Yes, they are for someone."" The blonde counts her money, opens the register, and smiles conspiratorially. ""A *special* someone, perhaps?"" she inquires, smirking when her question causes the angel to blush heavily. ""Thought so. In that case, you made a good choice with these ones."" she says after closing the cash drawer. ""They're one heck of a way to say you care about them."" Suzumi gives her a nod and a slightly embarrassed ""Thank you"" as the cashier hands over her box of pastries.

Sitting down at an open table, she opens the thermal bag she brought and grabs the beige and muted yellow box, but stops right before she puts it in. *Just making sure,* she tells herself before setting it down and opening up the surprisingly thick cardboard container to peek inside. Staring back at her are twenty caramel and chocolate-drizzled profiteroles laying on a sheet of parchment paper. *My word, these look delicious. He's going to love these.*

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The sun is beginning to set when her train finally arrives in the DU. She stops and leans against one of the station's walls and looks up, drinking in the colors before resuming her journey to SCHALE.

It's always been common knowledge that Kivotos has spectacular sunsets. The way the deep orange, yellow and red hues paint the sky is nothing short of beautiful. Sharing that gorgeous view with someone you love was an undeniably romantic experience, so much so that the Sunset Confession/Date™  is practically mandated to appear in every romance novel or VN she's ever read (and those thin books Koharu always confiscates). *And yet somehow,* the angel muses while waiting for a crosswalk's signal to turn green, *we haven't watched one together.*

It wasn't really that surprising of a realization. Just another consequence of keeping their relationship a secret. There were times she dearly wishes that it wasn't the case, that she could hold his hand while out on a walk or peck him on the cheek after bringing him lunch while he's working. Still, Suzumi doesn't mind it too much. Their mutual affection is vastly more important than being public about their bond, and that flame burns brighter than any star she could possible name. *Besides, I'm going to cross that particular activity off my list tonight.* Her halo glows brighter and a smile stretches across her face once again as the thought of her beloved runs through her head. This time, she doesn't try to hide it from her fellow pedestrians.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even though he looks exhausted, Sensei's still smiling.

It's a quality of his that she can't help but admire. Even when he's running on fumes and operating at his absolute limit, Sensei always maintains a positive outlook and a smile. Nothing could shake that cheery attitude of his, not even getting bombed and shot in the gut during the Eden Treaty incident (Blessed Saints, what a shitshow that was). Most of Kivotos is convinced it would take the world ending to make him frown. (Personally, Suzumi thinks that'd only be the case if he couldn't stop it.) So it's no surprise to her that when she walks into the main office for SCHALE, he's still wearing a small grin, even though he and Chinatsu are both working like fiends on the four inch-thick piles of paperwork. It'll always be a good shift if the Prefect Team's elf-eared medic is there: her demeanor is pleasant, the work gets done no matter how much there is, and the coffee's always fresh.

She takes a minute to stash her pastries in the office fridge and grab two cans of Monster.  Suzumi greets the pair, passing one of the energy drinks to her lover and keeping one for herself. Her and Chinatsu engage in some idle conversation about the weather (it's been decent, but it's supposed to rain heavily tomorrow), the behavior of their school's respective delinquent population (the gangsters' current move seems to be quietly pushing the envelope to see what they're able to get away with) and the day's workload (fairly large thanks to Sensei spending the afternoon on a train retrieving a Trinity artifact, but they've gotten it down to the five stacks on his desk ). Eventually, Chinatsu says her goodbyes and departs for Gehenna, thankful for an afternoon free of dealing with food terrorists.

For a few moments, both Sensei and Suzumi say nothing, opting to reduce the paperwork and slake their mutual caffeine addictions. Neither one dares to make a sound, lest someone catch them in the act. Yet another necessary sacrifice in the name of secrecy. The moments drag on second by agonizingly slow second, until finally she can't take it any more. With surprising speed, she grabs Sensei by his tie, drags his chair in close, and passionately kisses him, using her wing to caress his cheek gently while she does so. ""Father Almighty, I've missed you,"" she says after reluctantly breaking off the kiss, unable to stop the smile from spreading across her face. Sensei soon sports a similar smile. ""I missed you too, my love. Now let's get cracking on the paperwork.""

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*It's moments like this one,* Suzumi muses, *that make all the sacrifices and toil worth it.* 

Her and Sensei are curled up together in a hammock he set up on the roof of the SCHALE building, snacking on profiteroles and watching the sunset. This is one of the best nights they've spent together: the food is delicious, the sky is gorgeous and the hammock is comfy. The best thing about tonight, though, is at long last, the couple can be openly affectionate. She can cozy up in his arms and whisper sweet nothings to him without worrying about voyeurs. Here, he can stroke her hair and rub her wing without looking over his shoulder.  Suzumi can't wait until times like this are the norm and not the exception. *Until then, I'll savor each and every moment we spend together. And those are sweeter than any desert in Kivotos.* ",12,1732662657.0,SenseisKitchen,0,1.0,False

As weaker hands surrendered their positions, seasoned warriors like Cryptoswich and BullofDeFi struck swiftly, accumulating $KENDU at the lowest levels with precision and foresight.

Now, the token stands stronger than ever. Its holder count has climbed to just under 15,000—an army four times the size of what supported its last all-time high of $300 million market cap during the summer bear market. This fortified base of disciplined and strategic holders is ready to launch Kendu Inu into a true bull market, where its potential knows no bounds.

But $KENDU is not just about strength in numbers; it wields real-world utility as its sharpest blade. With an energy drink, coffee brand, nightclub events, and more slicing through the barriers between crypto and everyday life, Kendu Inu is building a presence that commands attention and respect.

This is no ordinary comeback. It’s a calculated ascent, backed by a proven leadership with a doxxed shib veteran dev, a powerful community, and a mission that extends far beyond the charts. The path ahead is clear, and Kendu Inu is poised to strike with meteoric force.

This is the best and hardest working team in defi, and the entry price has never been better.

Soft foods even irritated it. It seems like it's no longer sensitive to cold, nor soft foods, but when I floss on the teeth alone it pinches pretty bad, especially if I use the thick floss/pick duo for when I'm at work, that's the WORST. It feels like I'm pulling my tooth out. When I chew on let's say a chip, it's not bad, depending where I chew on the molar it pinches. I fear it might be a hairline crack, or something.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

I’m diving into the idea of creating adult-themed indie games. I believe that truly meaningful entertainment is about more than just fun—it’s about satisfying deeper human needs, the ones that drive us at our core. To me, that’s the ultimate creative force, and I think adult games have the potential to explore these themes in ways that are bold, unique, and impactful. There’s so much untapped potential in this niche, and I’d love to explore it with others.

I’m looking for like-minded people who are curious about this space and open to chatting.

A bit about me: I come from a film production background and have experience working with investors. I’m new to game development but excited to explore how we can use storytelling and creative design to tap into something meaningful.

If this sounds interesting to you, let’s grab a coffee or anything and chat.

Looking forward to hearing from you!

23m (24 tomorrow!), UNR alumni, acoustic guitar player here. I'll cut to the chase: I've really been dying to form a small musical duet/trio/quartet to just play some soft acoustic covers at some local spots.

The dream would be to perform at coffee shops in my spare time with a couple others and just get paid in coffee lol. I really just want to jam and have a good time. A singer with a nice and gentle voice would be a plus!

I play a LOT of fingerstyle, flatpicked covers from bands like City and Colour, the 1975, Hozier, Iron and Wine, that kind of stuff. A little geekier, but i also play covers of soundtracks from games like Final Fantasy, Persona, and some shows even! Just vibey, easy listening :)

I play at the marina very often and people seem to enjoy the music, but I haven't been to a single coffee shop with live music in the mornings!

Is there any interest for something like this in Reno?
Would anyone be interested in forming a little group?
Don't worry, I'm not looking for some crazy experienced musicians :)

1h0ph76,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1h0ph76/delonghi_cold_brew_vs_over_ice/,Delonghi Cold Brew vs. Over ice ,"So, I thought I had my mind set on grabbing the Delonghi Dinamica Plus and was really excited about the over ice feature. That was until I saw a comparison video of the Eletta Explore and the Jura Z10 specifically focusing on comparing the way each machine produces cold brew. 

This will be my first super automatic purchase and I'm still confident about buying a Delonghi,but now I'm confused about which Delonghi.

Is there a difference between over ice and the cold brew features  on the Dinamica Plus and the Eletta Explore? Is the over ice simply iced coffee? Is the the cold brew truly a cold brew extraction process? 
Any insight on the differences is greatly appreciated.
Thanks in advance ☺️

1h0pfvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1h0pfvd/better_food_options/,Better food options,"Hi all! I've been ramping up going backpacking recently, but have generally been limited to just one night trips. I would like to expand past that, but food is my biggest issue to get past. I have a lot of food allergies and am yet to find good, prepackaged meals that can account for all of them. 

The allergies:

* Avocado
* Soy
* Barley, Rye
* Citrus
* Tree Nuts/Peanuts
* Sesame
* Onion
* Tomato
* Melons
* Green Beans
* Corn

Current food:

* \- 3-6 chicken thighs
* 2 3/4lb steaks
* 1.5lbs potatoes
* 16 brown sugar olive oil cookies(homemade)
* rice cakes(plain. Mostly to fill stomach space than actually provide calories)
* 4 1L Smart Waters
   * I fill one of these with a cold brew coffee, so I don't get a caffeine headache on the 2nd day

The steak and potatoes get split into 2 wrapped aluminum situations then frozen, I then reheat them over the fire. One for dinner and one for breakfast. This likely won't work in the summer, due to the heat thawing the second one out before it's breakfast time.

I also have a Grayl water filter. I've brought some river water home with me and will be testing it through the Grayl to make sure there's no allergens in it (may be a silly thing to worry about, but I'd rather test at home than on the trail). So, if that works, it'll be one 1L bottle and a Grayl instead of the 4 bottles.

I need better options for food, though. I intend to bring cheese the next time I go out, but that's just one change and doesn't allow me to extend to a 2-5 night trip. Are there meals I can dehydrate or freeze dry that would get me enough protein/calories to make it through an extended trip and not be starving?",1,1732661865.0,backpacking,0,1.0,False
1h0pfog,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1h0pfog/should_i_change_my_job_for_more_work_and_less/,Should I change my job for more work and less money?,"I work 150 to 170 hours of shifts per month in my current job. I have 2 days off per week. Daily working hours are 7 hours and 20 minutes of work, 30 minutes of lunch, and 10 minutes of coffee break. I have an indefinite work contract.

I work a night shift (23-07) for 3 days every 3 weeks. I work 8 hours without a break during those night shift days.

99% of the work is done standing, 1% of it consists of office/paper work.

The monthly gross salary is between 2900 and 3200 euros. After taxes and other deductions, the net amount varies between 2300 euros and 2500 euros. There are no fringe benefits other than private health insurance (which I need the approval of my supervisor to use).

I will work 220 hours per month in the job I plan on transferring to. It'll be a 9-5 office work. I will work from home. Only Sundays are off per week. 99% of the work is done sitting in front of the computer, and 1% of it consists of driving a car.

Salary is 2200 euros gross. The amount to be earned will probably be 1600 (±100) euros. No fringe benefits. The company could go bankrupt, as it is a startup, you know. So that means there's no job security.

However, I hate my current job, I wake up cursing every day, I am sick to my stomach, so to speak, of the toxicity of the people I work with. I end up getting a headache every day I come home from work. I have not come home with a smile on my face once in the past two years. This job has literally turned me into a completely different person, a zombie, who has lost all of his self-esteem. I feel like I have lost all my talents and personal qualifications. Because of my Irregular working hours, irregular sleeping schedule, irregular diet, and not being able to create time to train, I've gained 20 kilos. The job is quite demanding and stressful, whites started to pop in my head and I'm losing a lot of hair.

I do not live a very luxurious life with a net income of 2300 euros, I can set aside about 700-1000 euros per month for investments.

So at the company I'm planning on transitioning into, I will be working with a very small team (5 people) in my the sectors are completely different and I will not be doing any reporting to anybody. If things go well this year, my gross salary maybe around 2500 euros next year.

So if I keep on working for my current company, I may become mentally ill. There's no career development what so ever. Looks like I will be working 60 to 70 hours more, earn less and hopefully make a living with it.

These are two of my only options available for the time being. I live in a very small town up north. I cannot move to any other country until 2032 due to my immigration status.

I'm 33. Got a bachelor's degree but those jobs are completely irrelevant to my major.  How should I proceed?
