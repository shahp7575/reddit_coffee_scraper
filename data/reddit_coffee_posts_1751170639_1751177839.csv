The Quiet Mercy of Elijah Bell

Part I: Run

Nebraska Territory, February 1871

The road was nothing more than a gash in the earth, half-frozen mud churned by passing wagons and boots. Clara ran anyway, stumbling over the icy ruts. Snow spit sideways on the wind. Her coat—if you could call it that—was thin wool, no lining, too small to close over her swollen belly.

Her lungs were fire. Blood trickled down one leg, but she kept going.

Behind her, the glow of North Platte dimmed. The broken town had been her grave, not her shelter. She’d gone by “Cinnamon” there, sold whiskey and herself in equal measure. But the last man who paid for her didn’t want company—he wanted control. When she’d told him about the baby, he’d beat her until she was spitting blood and couldn’t breathe.

She left that night with her boots half-laced, the pain in her ribs like knives.

No plan. No destination. Just away.

⸻

She passed out somewhere past midnight, half-buried in snow in a drainage ditch. Death came close—closer than it ever had in all her years of whoring and hiding—but it wasn’t death that found her.

It was a farmer.

Elijah Bell didn’t say much, not then. He just scooped her up like she weighed nothing, tucked her coat around her belly, and carried her through the wind like he was ferrying a wounded soldier.

When she woke, her first thought was that she’d died and God had taken pity.

The room was warm, firelight flickering against plank walls. A tin kettle steamed gently on the stove. Her boots had been set neatly by the door. And on the nightstand: a chipped mug of water, half a biscuit, and a folded note in careful, plain handwriting:

Rest. You’re safe. — E.B.

⸻

The next day, she met the man who’d found her.

He was tall, weather-bitten, his skin leathered from sun and wind. Clean-shaven, but not soft. He wore his grief like a second coat. She could see it in the way he set the table for two, then paused before clearing the second plate. In the way he looked out the window a long time before answering a question.

“You got a name?” he asked on the second day.

“Clara,” she rasped. Her throat was raw.

“Last name?”

She stared into her bowl. “Not one that matters.”

He didn’t press. Just nodded and said, “I’m Elijah. You’re welcome here till you get your feet under you.”

She should’ve asked what he wanted in return. But she was too tired. Too broken. And part of her—deep down, buried under the bruises and the bitterness—hoped he meant it.

⸻

Part II: The Courting That Wasn’t

(Nebraska Territory, February 1871)

Clara woke on the fifth morning in Elijah Bell’s home to the smell of bacon, and to the sound of a man very clearly trying to not burn down the kitchen.

She shuffled in, hair a mess, wrapped in Elijah’s old flannel coat—he’d insisted she wear it, seeing as hers “had more holes than cloth.”

The man stood with his back to her, facing a skillet that hissed like it had opinions. He was stiff as a fence post and frowning as though the bacon had insulted his honor.

“I think you’re supposed to flip it,” she said, stifling a laugh.

He jumped.

“Didn’t hear you,” he muttered. “Was tryin’ to—well. You been eatin’ so little, I thought I’d make breakfast.”

“Burnt pig fat’s very thoughtful,” she said, sinking into the chair. “Truly romantic.”

He turned and gave her a look that might’ve been a smile, if you tilted your head and squinted.

“It’s not burnt,” he argued.

A blackened slice flopped out of the pan and disintegrated.

They stared at it.

“I was gonna say ‘thank you,’” Clara said. “But I feel like I should say ‘rest in peace’ instead.”

⸻

Later that week, he asked her to help with the chickens.

“I don’t like birds,” she said flatly.

“They’re hens. They don’t like you either.”

“Comforting.”

Out they went.

Clara stood warily outside the coop, belly poking against her coat, watching the little monsters with suspicion.

“Do they bite?” she asked.

“They peck.”

“Same thing.”

Elijah entered the pen like he was storming a battlefield. Collected four eggs in one callused hand, calm as a man peeling potatoes. Clara crept in behind him and tried to mimic it.

Unfortunately, a hen—large and mean-looking—had other plans.

Clara reached for the egg.

The hen screeched like Satan himself.

Clara screamed.

Elijah looked up just in time to see her backing away from the chicken like it was a rattlesnake, hands in the air. The hen flapped its wings triumphantly.

“I’m not going back in there,” Clara announced. “That thing is possessed.”

“It’s just Henrietta.”

“She needs an exorcism.”

⸻

That night, they sat by the fire in silence. Comfortable silence. Clara sipped tea with honey. Elijah read from a battered book.

“What’s that?” she asked.

“Poetry,” he said gruffly.

She blinked. “You’re joking.”

“No.”

“Elijah Bell, reading poetry?”

He shrugged, not looking up. “My mother liked it. Used to read me bits. Stuck.”

Clara snorted. “What’s next? You gonna start quilting?”

He gave her a side-eye. “I know how to sew, if that’s what you mean.”

She laughed until her ribs ached.

⸻

By the tenth day, she was folding linens when she heard him swearing in the barn.

She waddled out, arms crossed.

“What now?”

“Horse threw a shoe,” he grunted.

“I thought you were good at this stuff.”

He wiped his brow. “Normally am. Just—can’t see the nail hole.”

She came closer, peered at the hoof. Then reached out.

“May I?”

He looked hesitant. Then nodded.

She crouched—awkwardly, belly and all—and ran her hand over the horse’s fetlock.

“There.”

He stared.

She glanced up. “You think I lived in brothels and didn’t learn how to fix things? Had to keep a stable neat. You’d be surprised what a woman can do when no one else is sober enough to lift a hammer.”

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he offered the shoe with a quiet: “Go on, then.”

They hammered it in together.

Clara’s arms were shaking by the end. Elijah didn’t say anything about that—but he handed her a cup of water the second she was done.

“Guess we make a decent team,” she said.

His eyes lingered on hers just a second too long.

“I guess we do.”

⸻

That night, she found herself humming while brushing her hair. She didn’t know the tune. But it felt like something from long ago—before saloons, before bruises, before Jesse Vorn.

She stared at herself in the mirror.

Her cheeks were pink from cold, not rouge. Her hands smelled like hay and soap, not cheap perfume. And she was smiling.

Not a fake one.

Not one she was paid for.

A real, foolish, genuine smile.

⸻

Part III: The Offer

Two weeks passed. Her bruises faded from black to yellow. She helped with the chores as best she could, though bending made her belly cramp. Elijah never let her carry heavy buckets. Said nothing about her past, nor the child growing inside her. He treated her like a guest. Or maybe something gentler. Like a person.

It was that, more than the food or the roof, that made her cry into her blanket some nights. Just the simple, unbearable kindness.

Then one morning, as she hung linens on the line, he came to her with a quiet sort of urgency.

“I want to offer you something,” he said.

She turned slowly, snow on her lashes. “I ain’t that kind of woman anymore, Mister Bell.”

He shook his head, earnest and awkward. “Not what I meant. I’m askin’ if you’d marry me. Not now. When you’re ready.”

She froze. Her fingers clenched the clothespin like a blade.

“Why?”

“Because no woman should go through birth alone. Because you’re good with your hands, and kind to my horse, and I’ve had enough silence in this house to last me ten lifetimes. And because I want to give you and that child a name that means something.”

Clara stared at him like he’d gone mad. “You don’t know what I’ve done.”

“I know you’re here,” he said simply. “And that’s enough.”

⸻

Part III½: Elijah Bell vs. the Bonnet

March, 1871

They’d had the talk about marriage.

He’d made the offer.

Clara hadn’t answered—not yet.

But she hadn’t run, either.

And somehow, that was enough for Elijah Bell to start preparing.

⸻

She found him hunched over the kitchen table, elbows tight, shoulders bunched like he was doing battlefield triage. Except instead of blood and gunpowder, it was… muslin. A lot of muslin. And thread. Everywhere.

Clara blinked.

He didn’t notice her. He was biting his tongue, needle in hand, eyes narrowed at what looked like a fabric blob.

“Am I interrupting something intimate?” she asked, half-smiling.

He jerked back. “No—no, just—uh, making a thing.”

“I can see that.” She stepped closer. “Is it…a dish towel?”

“It’s a bonnet,” he muttered.

Clara stared. “Oh.”

A pause.

“For a baby?”

“Yes.”

She very nearly lost it.

“I’m sorry,” she said, pressing a hand over her mouth. “It’s just—Elijah Bell, war veteran and corn-grower, sewing bonnets?”

He set the needle down with all the dignity of a man whose pride had taken a hit.

“I figured… I don’t know. You’d need some things. For the baby. I didn’t want to send to town yet. And I thought, ‘How hard can a bonnet be?’”

Clara bit her lip. “So you used my tea towel?”

He frowned. “It was clean.”

She laughed, belly shaking under her apron. “That’s very generous of you. I’m sure the baby will appreciate smelling faintly of Earl Grey.”

Elijah stood, clearly trying to salvage what was left of his pride. “I can be useful.”

“Oh, you are. Very.”

She reached over and gently picked up the bonnet. It looked like a confused flower. One side was much longer than the other. A piece of lace dangled off like it had tried to escape mid-sewing and given up.

Clara looked at it a moment.

Then, without teasing, she said, “It’s the ugliest bonnet I’ve ever seen.”

“I knew it,” he groaned, turning away.

“But,” she said, standing, “it’s also the first thing anyone’s ever made for this child. And I love it.”

He turned back. “You don’t have to say that.”

She shrugged. “I mean it.”

She took the bonnet, placed it gently on the shelf beside the tin of flour, and gave him a soft look.

“No one’s ever tried like this before,” she said.

Then, after a moment: “Come here.”

He hesitated. “Why?”

“Because if you’re going to be a bonnet-maker, you need a better teacher.”

They sat side by side at the table, her belly wedged between them, and she showed him how to hold the needle without jabbing himself. He winced every time the thread tangled. She grinned every time he swore under his breath.

Eventually, the sun dipped low, and they’d made something that almost resembled a baby cap.

They looked at it in silence.

“It’s still kind of lopsided,” he said.

“It’ll match the baby’s hair, I’m sure.”

He smiled at her, really smiled. The lines around his mouth softened. Something unspoken lingered in the air between them—comfort, maybe. Or the terrifying, miraculous beginnings of family.

Clara laid the little bonnet on the table and said, quietly:

“We’ll need a whole stack of these if she’s anything like me.”

He looked at her. “So you’re staying?”

“I didn’t say that.”

“You didn’t not say it.”

She didn’t answer.

But she didn’t move, either.

And she took his hand.

_______________
Part IV: The past comes calling 

They married in March, with the snow still clinging to the fenceposts and mud rising in the fields. The preacher raised an eyebrow when he saw her belly, but said nothing. Elijah said his vows with a soldier’s steadiness, hand trembling only slightly as he placed the gold band on her finger.

Clara had never worn a ring that didn’t come with a price.

Now, she wore one that came with a promise.

But the world doesn’t let go of women like Clara so easily.

In April, her past caught up.

One afternoon, a rider came down the road—a man in a dusty bowler hat, long coat, revolver at his hip. Elijah was out in the pasture. Clara opened the door herself, heart pounding.

“Well I’ll be damned,” the man said with a cruel smile. “Didn’t think you’d run this far.”

Her stomach clenched. “Go away, Jesse.”

He spat in the dirt. “You stole from me.”

“I took back what was mine.”

He stepped closer. “You owe me. That baby’s mine. Don’t think you can play house with some hayseed and pretend you ain’t what you are.”

Clara didn’t cry. Not this time. She stepped out onto the porch and stood straight, hands on her hips.

“Elijah!” she called without looking away. “We’ve got company.”

The farmer came around the barn, shotgun in hand, gaze steady.

Jesse took one look at Elijah—at the long-barreled weapon, the war-scars still visible in his stance—and sneered.

“Ain’t worth the bullet,” he muttered, turning his horse. “But you ain’t heard the last of me.”

As he disappeared over the rise, Elijah put a hand on Clara’s back. Not possessive. Protective.

“You alright?”

She nodded, barely.

Then, tears welling, she whispered, “You still want this life? Even with all the baggage I carry?”

Elijah looked at her with eyes steady as oak.

“I married you, Clara. Not your past.”

Flashback: Cinnamon’s Last Night

North Platte, January 1870

The saloon smelled of sweat, whiskey, and rotgut dreams. Smoke coiled like ghosts through the rafters. Laughter came sharp and mean, echoing off warped piano keys and slurred songs. Upstairs, behind a green velvet curtain and a door with peeling paint, Clara—known here only as Cinnamon—sat on a cracked chair with a mirror in her lap, painting rouge over a bruise.

The bruise was fresh. A gift from a ranch hand who didn’t like to be told “no,” even with her smile painted on.

Her shift started in ten minutes.

She adjusted her corset—tight, even over her swelling belly—and touched the locket around her neck. It didn’t open anymore, rusted shut. Inside was a photograph of her mother, or so she’d been told. She had no memory of the woman, only that she’d died on the riverboats when Clara was barely walking.

“You ready, girl?”

It was Tessa, another working girl, with tired eyes and a drink in her hand.

Clara nodded. “Almost.”

“You better be. He’s asking for you again.”

Clara’s stomach knotted.

“He” was Jesse Vorn—her most regular, and her most dangerous.

He was a gambler by trade, a liar by habit, and a sadist by preference. He liked to make her cry, then pay double. The first time she’d tried to leave, he’d found her before the train even left the station. He’d smiled as he dragged her back. The sheriff wouldn’t intervene. Jesse played poker with him on Sundays.

Last week, she’d finally told Jesse about the baby. Not because she trusted him—because she’d hoped, in some desperate part of her soul, that he might soften.

Instead, he hit her. Hard enough to knock her into the table. Then he’d leaned close and said, “You think you get out just ‘cause you got knocked up? You belong to me. That bastard baby too.”

That night, she bled. Not much. Just enough to terrify her.

She told Madame Clea she was sick. Took three days to walk again.

Now she looked at her reflection. Rouge couldn’t hide the hollow in her cheeks. Lipstick couldn’t cover the tremble in her mouth. But she still looked like what men paid for.

Cinnamon. Spicy. Sweet. For sale.

She stood. Fixed her garter. And that’s when she heard it.

Down the hall: shouting. Glass breaking. A woman crying out.

She flinched—but didn’t move.

She’d seen girls leave. Heard them swear they’d never come back. A week later, they were back on the porch, stomachs emptier, eyes deader. The world didn’t take kindly to women who forgot their place.

But as she looked at herself—at the life that would come from her body, at the bruise on her cheek—something inside her snapped.

She walked to the dresser. Pulled open the drawer. Inside: a small pouch of coins she’d hidden behind a loose board, a wool scarf, and a folded pair of baby shoes she’d stitched in secret.

She took them all.

Then she went downstairs, eyes ahead, heart pounding.

Through the saloon. Past Jesse at the table.

He didn’t see her.

God must’ve blinked.

She slipped through the batwing doors and into the cold. Just started walking.

She didn’t stop.

Not even when the snow came.

Not even when her feet bled.

Not even when the sun set and the wolves howled and every part of her body screamed.

Because for the first time in her life, she wasn’t just running from something.

She was running to something.

_________________
Part V: The Storm

Nebraska Territory, April 1871

The thunder came just before midnight.

Low and long—more a warning than a roar. The wind howled next, pushing against the farmhouse like it wanted in. The shutters creaked. Rain lashed the roof like a thousand fingernails.

Elijah sat in his chair, sharpening a small carving knife. He didn’t look up when the lightning flashed, but he counted the seconds between it and the thunder, just like he used to on the battlefield.

Then he heard it.

A sharp intake of breath.

He turned.

Clara was standing by the hearth, one hand pressed to her belly, the other bracing against the mantle. Her eyes were wide. Not afraid—but focused. Like a woman bracing for something she already knew was coming.

“Elijah,” she said quietly.

He stood. “What is it?”

She looked up at him, sweat already shining on her brow.

“I think… it’s time.”

⸻

It started slow.

She paced the floor while he boiled water and laid out towels, trying to remember everything Miss Maggie—the midwife from three farms over—had shouted at him two weeks ago when he’d asked what to expect.

Keep her walking. Keep her warm. Don’t let her push too early. Pray.

But by the time the wind cracked the barn doors open, Clara was kneeling by the bed, teeth clenched, face pale and tight with pain.

The contractions came in waves now. Long, brutal, relentless.

And Miss Maggie? Was three miles away. Across two rivers. In the middle of a storm.

They were alone.

⸻

“Elijah,” Clara panted, gripping his hand so hard he thought his fingers might break. “I—I can’t—”

“Yes, you can,” he said, wiping her brow with a cloth.

She shook her head violently. “No—no, I can’t do this. Not again. I don’t want to lose it.”

His heart clenched.

“You won’t,” he said, voice low. “I’m here. I won’t let that happen.”

She let out a shuddering breath.

Lightning flared, throwing shadows across the room. The fire flickered, almost out. The whole house felt like it was holding its breath.

Then Clara let out a scream—full and primal—and collapsed back on the bed, sobbing.

“I’m not ready,” she whispered. “What if I’m not meant to have something good? What if this ends the way everything else does?”

Elijah knelt beside her, his hand shaking as he cupped her face.

“You’re not alone this time,” he said. “Whatever comes, I’m here.”

She blinked at him, wide-eyed and trembling.

And then the next contraction hit.

⸻

The storm built to a fury outside.

Inside, it was quieter. Only Clara’s ragged breathing, the rustle of fabric, the steady sound of Elijah counting under his breath, guiding her.

She cursed. She prayed. She nearly broke his hand.

Then, suddenly—

A sharp cry.

A real one.

Not hers.

A baby’s.

High and furious and alive.

⸻

Elijah stood frozen, blood rushing in his ears. Clara lay back, eyes wide, mouth open in disbelief.

And then the baby—tiny and red-faced—was in his hands.

A girl.

A furious, squalling girl.

“I got her,” he said, almost laughing. “Clara—I got her.”

Clara sobbed—loud, joyful, and exhausted.

He wrapped the baby in a towel, gently placed her on Clara’s chest. She clutched the child like something sacred, her whole body curling around her.

“She’s perfect,” Clara whispered, voice raw. “She’s real.”

Elijah crouched beside her, one hand on the child’s back, the other on Clara’s hair.

“You did it,” he said. “You both did.”

Clara looked at him, eyes glassy and glowing.

“You really meant it,” she said. “All this time—you really meant it.”

He met her gaze.

“I told you,” he whispered. “I married you. Not your past.”

Lightning flashed one last time, but the thunder was softer now.

The storm was passing.

Inside the little farmhouse, three people huddled close—breathing the same air, sharing the same warmth.

And for the first time in her life, Clara knew what it meant to come through the dark and find someone still waiting on the other side.

__________________________
Part VI: Nothing to Prove

Late April, 1871

The baby—whom Clara had named Lily—was asleep at last.

A miracle, considering she’d spent the last two hours wailing with all the righteous fury of a tiny, red-faced queen.

Now, she lay swaddled in her little crib near the hearth, one hand curled into a delicate fist. Her mouth was parted slightly, as if she’d fallen asleep mid-complaint.

Elijah leaned against the doorframe, watching Clara tuck a quilt around the baby’s legs. She moved carefully, like she was still afraid she might break something, but with a mother’s instinct that surprised even her.

He cleared his throat.

She turned, brushing a loose curl out of her face.

“You should be sleeping,” he said.

“So should you.”

They stared at each other.

It had been two weeks since the storm. Two weeks of shared silences, midnight cries, awkward kindnesses, and careful space. He’d slept in the barn most nights—not because she asked him to, but because neither of them had said anything different.

Now, something in the air had shifted.

“I made tea,” he said, holding up two chipped mugs.

She arched a brow. “You finally stopped burning the water?”

“Don’t push it.”

They sat at the table in the dim firelight, elbows brushing. She sipped. Winced. “Still tastes like hay.”

“Tea leaves are expensive.”

She looked at him. He was watching her. Not in the way men used to watch her—with hunger, with calculation—but with curiosity. Like he still couldn’t quite believe she was real.

“I don’t know how to do this,” she said suddenly.

He blinked. “Drink tea?”

She smirked. “Be a… wife. Or whatever this is. I was never someone’s first choice, Elijah. Usually not even the second. Just the one who was easy to forget.”

His expression darkened. He set his cup down gently.

“I don’t want easy,” he said. “I want you.”

Clara swallowed hard.

There was a pause. A thick, tender quiet.

Then he said, softer, “Can I show you something?”

She nodded.

He rose and walked to the little cupboard near the hearth. From behind it, he pulled out something wrapped in cloth. Handed it to her.

She unwrapped it slowly.

It was… a book.

Worn leather. Faded letters.

She opened the cover and saw, in delicate ink:

Poems for Grace Bell.
A wedding gift. 1837.

“My mother’s,” Elijah said. “She read them to me every spring. It’s all I kept when we buried her.”

Clara ran her fingers over the pages.

“You want me to have it?” she whispered.

“I want Lily to grow up hearing beauty. From someone who knows what ugly looks like, but chose better.”

Her breath hitched.

She stood.

He stood too.

They didn’t speak. Didn’t move.

Then Clara reached up and touched his face, fingertips light as breath along his jaw. “You’re the first good man I’ve ever known,” she said.

Elijah leaned forward, slowly, as if she might change her mind.

She didn’t.

Their lips met—soft, unsure, a little clumsy. But real.

He cupped her cheek. She pressed against his chest.

No fire. No urgency.

Just warmth.

Just home.

When they pulled apart, she was crying.

He didn’t ask why.

He just pulled her into his arms, held her close, and whispered, “You don’t have to prove anything to me, Clara. You already did.”

______________________
Part VII: A Morning Like This

August, 1871

The sun was just lifting over the prairie, soft and gold, stretching long arms across the tallgrass like it didn’t want to wake the world too fast.

Clara stood on the porch barefoot, Lily in her arms, both of them watching the cornfields sway like a slow sea. The baby was getting heavier by the day—rounder cheeks, thicker tufts of dark hair, little fists that had learned how to grip with shocking determination.

Elijah was in the yard, shirt damp with morning dew, chopping wood in steady rhythm. She watched the muscle in his arm flex with each swing of the axe and smiled a little to herself.

The man moved like a hymn. Quiet, steady, familiar.

She still wasn’t used to the peace.

It snuck up on her in moments like this—when the wind was soft, and no one needed anything from her except what she already had to give. Lily’s sleepy coos. The sound of the chickens pecking. The smell of warm biscuits rising from the oven she’d stoked herself.

A different kind of strength lived in her now.

Not just survival.

Belonging.

⸻

Elijah came up the steps, wiping his brow, and kissed her forehead without asking. It still startled her sometimes—how freely he gave affection, like it was just another language he’d decided she ought to learn.

He peeked down at Lily.

“She spit up on me twice already,” Clara said, matter-of-fact. “If she does it again, you’re doing laundry.”

He nodded solemnly. “We’ll have to burn your dress.”

Clara laughed.

“I made coffee,” he added. “You can taste the beans this time.”

“I’ll be the judge of that.”

They sat on the porch steps together, Lily nestled between them, her fingers twitching in a dream.

For a while, they said nothing.

Just watched the prairie breathe.

⸻

After a long silence, Elijah spoke.

“I was thinking,” he said. “Maggie brought by that flyer last week. The schoolteacher in town is leaving come fall.”

Clara raised a brow.

“And?”

“And… I thought maybe you’d want to apply.”

She blinked. “Me?”

“You can read better than anyone I know. Lily’s gonna learn her letters by the time she can walk. Might as well teach a few others while you’re at it.”

Clara stared out across the fields.

The idea of standing in front of a classroom made her palms sweat. But the idea of being wanted—of being seen as someone who could do more than survive…

It stirred something deep in her.

“I’ll think about it,” she said softly.

He nodded. Didn’t press.

Another breeze moved across the porch. Lily let out a gurgling sigh and kicked one tiny foot.

Elijah watched her.

“You ever think,” he said, “how lucky she is? She’ll never know the woman you used to be.”

Clara looked down at her daughter’s face.

“No,” she said. “But I’ll never forget. That’s how I know what kind of mother I want to be.”

Elijah reached over and squeezed her hand.

Not tightly.

Just enough.

They sat like that until the sun climbed high and the coffee cooled. Until Lily woke and demanded breakfast with all the imperious squeals of a beloved child.

And as Clara rose and carried her inside, she realized something simple and quiet:

For the first time in her life, she wasn’t waiting for something to go wrong.

She was home.

___________________________
Part VIII: What the Past Doesn’t Know (still don’t like that title)

November, 1871

Clara stood in front of the blackboard, chalk dust on her fingers, a stubborn curl falling across her forehead.

“‘T-H-E-I-R,’” she said slowly, turning to the row of squirming children. “Means belonging to them. As in, ‘The chickens got out of their pen again.’”

A small voice piped up from the back. “My pa says grammar’s for bankers and ladies who faint.”

Clara raised an eyebrow. “Tell your pa I’ve been both, and I still think it matters.”

The room erupted in giggles.

She smiled, turning back to the board, heart steady.

She wasn’t the woman who’d arrived here beaten and afraid.

She was Clara Bell now—Mrs. Bell, according to the scrawled sign outside the schoolhouse door. She’d earned that name with sweat, with sleepless nights, and with the quiet triumph of choosing a life.

Every morning, Elijah brought her coffee and kissed her goodbye with Lily tucked in one arm. Every afternoon, she walked home past the field where he worked with his sleeves rolled up and a crooked smile waiting just for her.

She was finally, fully herself.

So when the door slammed open behind her that Monday morning, her body stiffened—but she didn’t flinch.

Not even when she heard his voice.

⸻

“Clara.”

The name hit the room like a thunderclap.

She turned.

And there he was.

Jesse Monroe.

Dusty coat. Leaner than before. Scar along his jaw that hadn’t been there last time. And eyes—those same dark, dead eyes—that had once promised her the world, then delivered her to hell.

The children stared in frozen silence.

Clara stood straight.

“Class,” she said, voice calm, “recess. Now.”

They filed out quickly, sensing danger.

She didn’t move until the door clicked shut behind the last one.

Then: “You’re late.”

Jesse smirked. “I heard you was playing house. Teaching school. Married a farmer with soft hands.”

Clara said nothing.

He stepped forward. “You run off with my child, Clara. My name. My money.”

Her hands tightened behind her back.

“She’s not your child,” she said evenly. “You gave that up when you gave me bruises instead of bread.”

His face twisted. “You were mine.”

“No,” she said. “I survived you.”

Then Elijah’s voice came through the open window.

“Clara?”

He was already running toward the schoolhouse.

Jesse moved fast—too fast.

Clara barely had time to shout before Jesse drew the pistol from under his coat.

She threw herself behind a desk as the shot cracked through the room, splintering the blackboard behind her. Glass shattered. Children screamed from outside.

But Elijah didn’t stop running.

He burst through the door like a storm himself, rifle raised.

“Get away from her.”

Jesse turned.

And smiled.

“Farmer-boy thinks he’s a hero now.”

Elijah didn’t respond with words.

Just one sharp, practiced motion. One clean shot.

The pistol fell from Jesse’s hand first.

Then Jesse himself followed.

⸻

By the time the sheriff arrived, Jesse Monroe was dead.

Elijah stood outside the schoolhouse, arms wrapped tight around Clara, who hadn’t said a word in twenty minutes.

She’d held it together through the chaos. Through the body being hauled off. Through the sheriff’s questions. Through the children crying.

But when Elijah pressed a kiss to her temple, she broke.

Quietly. With shudders, not sobs.

“I thought he’d never find me,” she whispered. “And part of me always thought he would.”

“He can’t anymore,” Elijah said. “It’s over.”

She looked up at him, eyes wide.

“No,” she said. “It’s finished. There’s a difference.”

He nodded.

She stood straighter.

And when the school bell rang, she walked back inside.

Thirty minutes later, Clara Bell resumed her lesson on possessive pronouns. Her voice was clear. Her back was straight. Her hands no longer trembled.

And when she wrote “T-H-E-I-R” again on the board, she smiled.

Because now, for the first time, nothing could take what was theirs.

1ln7l1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ln7l1y/im_very_excited_to_do_this_ive_planned_it_all_out/,I’m very excited to do this I’ve planned it all out! What do you guys think?,"When I first did keto, I had an over eating issue before keto which turned me to binge eating issue from keto. However now I’ve been on a medication that fixed that so the binge eating has gotten better even without it. But I wanna get off this medication or just rely on it less. When I was first doing keto, I was also taking in a loooot of sweeteners and just binge eating on cheese because people would say “you need more fat you need more fat” but idk I don’t think that’s always the answer I think. It’s just too easy to eat. I don’t wanna force feed myself fat over more filling foods. Also I was constantly eating keto ice cream/keto protein bars/ Diet Coke/ chewing gum.

This time, my binge eating issue is better due to the medication I’m on. I wanna start keto to get off this medication. This time, absolutely NO sweeteners WHATSOEVER. I don’t care. I’m not on keto to replace sugar. And this time, I won’t force feed myself high calorie high fat food. I know some may disagree but I’ll add fat as needed.

Here’s my plan. 

Breakfast: coffee with 1/4 cup heavy cream

Lunch: 5-10 oz spinach with 4oz feta and 2 tbs lite balsamic vinegar dressing and optional shredded cheese if not satiating enough (will experiment with how much cheese if adding)

Dinner: entire pack of pre-cooked frozen chicken breast strips with shredded cheese melted on top

Snack: coffee with unsweetened almond milk

Calories / nutrients may vary based on how much cheese I decide to add but here’s the range

Calories : 1250-1550

Net carbs:25g-30g

Protein:136g-152g

Fat: 70g-87g

Potassium 3200mg-4150mg (depends on how much spinach I decide and what feels best)

Sodium 4400mg-5000mg

Will supplement a multi vitamin, magnesium glycinate, magnesium citrate, 

And a couple if hormone balance supplements and possibly maca root. << these don’t matter though

Water : minimum 8-10 cups

My workouts: generally sedentary out of the gym. Will walk 1 mile at 9% incline 3-4 days a week and will do my regular lifting routine



Anyways this is perfect. I like things simplified. This is easy to follow, good calorie range, enough sodium, potassium and magnesium citrate. And NO SWEETENERS. I need an easy to follow plan. I just need a good diet so I can feel physically and mentally better. Obviously I will adjust my plan based on how I feel and will add more calories / fat if needed

The reason I wanna do this, is because I am relatively fit. I workout and have an okay body but I’ve been falling off due to personal issues and due to my diet. My lifting is the same but my lack of protein made me lose muscle and gain fat. I used to have a super nice toned stomach, now it’s a bit fatter even though I workout the same. So I want a better body without changing my workout routine because my diet is the issue not my workouts. I also wanna feel less bloated all the time.

I also want more energy. I’ve been slacking off the gym so much. Feeling so damn lazy for whatever reason. I force myself to go to the gym just to maintain what I have but I’ve been seriously slacking and I’m hating it. I used to burn 700+ calories from the stair master, I used to workout 5 days a week. Now? 2, 3 days if I’m lucky. Last week I went once. This week maybe twice. I’m losing so much progress from my lack of energy and motivation. I think what you eat heavily affects your mood, motivation and energy. I also just want more energy and focus outside of the gym. I’m tired of feeling like this. 

I am 24, female, 5’8, 158-160lbs but pretty fit. But I just know when I fix my diet, I’ll gain back the muscle I have. And I wouldn’t mind losing 5-10 more lbs. I looked best at 152lbs. 

Lastly, I want better skin. I don’t know what the hell happened to my skin. No matter what skin routine I do, I keep getting hormonal acne. When I did keto for that brief period of time(even though I did it wrong) my skin wasn’t just clean. It was LITERALLY glowing. I don’t know because I’ve had a bad diet before and my skin wasn’t this bad. Maybe my diet got even worse. I just miss clear skin. It isn’t horrible now, but it just won’t go away. It very likely may be the carbs I’m eating.  I think my diet is just way worse now. I miss glowing skin. 

So yeah this is my plan. What do you guys think? I spent so much time building a perfect plan that is affordable, easy to follow, little effort, and hits all my calories and electrolytes I need. I don’t wanna eat lite salt water to get my electrolytes. I just want a simple plan. I don’t mind cooking for my husband but I hate cooking for myself. I wanna eat almost the same every day. I wanna forget sugar and carbs and feel good. I’m really excited! I have a perfect weekly grocery list I can have delivered to me! I’m done eating out entirely for now. This costs me $13-$14 a day worth of groceries which sounds like a lot (mainly from the pre cooked chicken) but it evens out because the simplicity is worth it and the fact I’m done eating out or ordering $10 coffees. Around $420 a month for everything. Coffee, food, milk, creamer, simple, get my electrolytes, enough calories and enough sodium. And if I ever wanna save $100 I’ll just cook my own chicken.

## Key Features Analysis

The Sublime Brands Milk chocolate Bar boasts several key features that contribute to its superior taste and overall quality.

**High-Quality cocoa beans:**

the Foundation of any great chocolate lies in the quality of its cocoa beans, and Sublime Brands sources only the finest. These beans are carefully selected from lasting farms known for their superior flavor profiles. The specific blend of beans is proprietary, but it is indeed rumored to include Criollo and Trinitario varieties, resulting in a complex and nuanced chocolate flavor.

**Creamy Milk Content:**

Improper tempering can result in grainy or dull chocolate, but Sublime Brands consistently delivers a flawlessly tempered bar.

**Natural Vanilla Extract:**

Unlike many mass-produced chocolate bars that rely on artificial vanilla flavoring, Sublime Brands uses only pure natural vanilla extract. This adds a subtle yet essential layer of complexity to the chocolate's flavor profile. The vanilla complements the cocoa and milk, enhancing the overall richness and aroma.

**Minimal Additives:**

Sublime Brands prioritizes the use of natural ingredients and avoids needless additives, preservatives, and artificial flavors.

They were in a plastic bag in the middle of our coffee table.

1. Riri Meneses and Ces Molina - their exit was so awful when their management, Avior Talents posted a statement that they are no longer part of the HD Spikers, citing overseas opportunities. Cignal countered their statement through na may option na sila to renew but on the deadline, they stopped responding to the Cignal HD Spikers management. It was speculated that a non-playing clause was activated after their abrupt exit to the team (speculation lamang po) and we might see them play in the 2026-2027 season.





2. Eya Laure - This Alas Pilipinas stalwart was tangled into a messy exit as well after she decided to call quits with the Chery Tiggo Crossovers with remaining years in her contract. Many speculated that her ex-team did her dirty dahil hindi siya naswelduhan ng kanyang mother club team (alongside Jen Nierva) dahil nagcommit sa NT during the Reinforced Conference. A non-playing clause for a year was activated and kahit makahanap na siya ng new team, still she will not be able to play until 2026. 





3. Jho Maraguinot - Galeries Tower Highrisers bid farewell to their players and the eagle claw was the one. While Roma Joy Doromal focused on other ventures and Renee Mabilangan found new home with the Thunderbelles, Maraguinot was yet to sign into a new team for the PVL On Tour Preseason. Will Jho finally found a new nest before the Reinforced Conference?





4. Bang Pineda - the legendary journey woman is yet to found a new jersey to collect (sorry Bang) but since her exit to nxled Chameleons, and nearly all 12 teams still have a libero surplus from the rookie draft. Will Bang finally found a new home or time for her to handle a whistle this time.




5. Michelle Gamit- Rumors swirling that she will be joining the winningest team the Creamline Cool Smashers but was all rumor now since the team acquired Sheena Toring and Nica Celis, both middle blockers from the draft. With Zus Coffee's recent middle blocker haul, where will Mich Gamit suit the best now that the Good Vibes team shutted the door for her? 





6. Anne Esguerra - another middle blocker released from the Nxled Chameleons was seen practicing with the PLDT High Speed Hitters but the team gave an assurance of being a practice player rather than signed into a roster. Esguerra's status remained unknown unless mambulaga ang PLDT sa July 1 against Farm Fresh Foxies 




7. Joan Narit- a dynamo middle blocker from the Ateneo De Manila University explored the two SGA teams. Now she's gone for good with the Thunderbelles and her name is now out of the Yee's roster.

I have a very vague memory of it, and have been searching online for months trying to find it, using the key words I remember. But I have failed. I hope someone on here can help me. :)
Here's what I remember...
1. It was a somewhat large book, big enough obviously for a child to see all the pictures. I would say around 8 to 10 inches in length or so.
2. It was hardcover, with paper pages. 
3. The plot or story was a detective mystery where you are the detective and you follow along to with the story to see the conclusion. This was a detective mystery, where some jewels were taken and you have to figure out who did it. Kind of like I Spy.
4. This was a picture book, with minimal wording or dialogue and with realistic photography/picture. Real objects were used when shooting the book. 
5. I only remember two pages from the book. One page is looking down at a diner table, where a newspaper is in front of you/the reader and it says that these famous jewels were taken. Besides it is a napkin with a coffee stain, a cup of steaming coffee, and a plate of two donuts. One has a bite taken out of it. The next page I remember is of a hotel floor, and you/the reader had bumped into a woman. Her purse is on the floor and the jewels had fallen out.

I just bought profitec go as my first espresso machine and i have never had one before, and i’m very new to coffee brewing.

What is the FLU stands for? What should i do in that case? The guide paper isn’t sufficient on what to do there.

The gauge of the pressure doesn’t increase up when i press the brewing button, instead only when the coffee has been extracted and i the brewing button  has been released- the pressure gauge goes up.

So, I've been thinking lately *The Sims 4* actually doesn't have that many small kitchen appliances. Yes, we’ve gotten a pizza oven (finally), the waffle maker, popcorn machine, and a few others… but I still feel like there’s a lot of potential that hasn’t been tapped into.

Here’s my personal wishlist

1. **Toaster** – Imagine you’re running late in the morning. You click the toaster, your Sim makes toast in 8 seconds, eats, and runs off to work or class. This would be perfect with *Discover University* too. Quick breakfast, small energy boost. Simple, but useful.
2. **Air Fryer** – I know *everyone* has one (and I’m sorry if you don’t), but in 2025 it really feels like almost everyone owns an air fryer. It could be a fun way to make modern, healthier meals. And if they made it slightly faster than the oven in-game, it’d be super convenient for busy Sims.
3. **Slow Cooker / Crock-Pot** – Not totally sure about this one, but it could work. If it cooked food over several in-game hours (like 4-5 hours), and gave you a powerful “homemade meal” buff when done, it would feel worth the wait  instead of just being another recycled cooking method.
4. **Keurig-style Coffee Machine** – I know *The Sims 4* already has a few coffee makers, but they’re all kind of bulky or old-fashioned. A sleek, fast single-serve machine could be great. It should be *very* quick to use.
5. **Blender for Smoothies** – Not the highest priority for me, but I wouldn’t say no. Smoothies could offer different effects depending on ingredients (health boost, energizing, flirty, etc.). Maybe it could even be tied to wellness or fitness.

I just feel like more appliances = more stories. Not every Sim is a gourmet chef — some just want quick toast and a smoothie before heading out.",7,1751174509.0,Sims4,9,0.82,False

We are lucky if he gets 11-12h total sleep in a day.

9month old, he was always a terrible sleeper. Minor improvement from a cooler room and sleeping bag, his cot is in our bedroom.. 

Bed time is 9pm to 7am, he wakes up calm, big eyes and playful. But he will have woken up minimum 6 times in the night, for boob or just to be comforted. 

His naps are intermittent never 1-2hours straight.. he will wake up and nag after 30min until either one of us goes in, gently outside him in his side and puts the pacifier back in his mouth. We are at 2 naps per day, usually 10.30 to 11.15-11.45, then 3.30pm to 4.30pm.

I'm the father, we sort of are handling this, during the night my wife is the one comforting him, although his nagging does wake me up too 😅, and I get out of bed at 6 in order to atleast enjoy a coffee and do some stuff, then I take him at 7 when he wakes up change his diaper and we go for a stroll to the park, we play, I give him his breakfast, and I wake my wife up at 9.30am so I can go to the office, that way she gets a good 2.5 hours uninterrupted. 

He is insanely energetic, crawling from 6mo and standing on two legs since 7mo, always trying to climb everything and wants to grab nd inspect every single thing in the universe haha.

He will start nursery school in 3 months and we are hoping that that will atleast tire him out a bit. 

Yesterday we went to a networking event at a villa, where loads of people played with him, he saw new things, played with dogs, was surrounded by dozens of people that he was just staring at and having fun.. he napped 30min in the car on the way home at 4pm, and then we went to the park and played... we thought that would perhaps tire him out enough for him to get a better night's sleep.. alas here I am since 6.45 with him and he is just wondering why we aren't going skydiving yet 🤣🤣

1ln6pqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1ln6pqv/daddy_issues/,Daddy issues,"it's been a minute since my last rant but do i have a doozie for you. *background* i'm 20(ftm) and i lost my mom last year in may. my dad has been renovating a lot and when i went to school he changed his entire bedroom and mine (with no input or even consulting me about any decisions bc he's decided to sell the house and he left all decorating decisions to my sister M even tho i sent him paint i wanted) so since coming back 2 months ago it's been hard adjusting. my sister M(near 30's?) is married and literally lives in our backyard. i was fine with it until i moved back. she moved during the school year due to issues in her original housing agreement (she is a tiny home owner not homeless). a lot of issues came with her moving in especially with my older sister E as she was supposed to move in and had an agreement with my dad (that is another can of worms that i don't want to open right now) and when M started talking about moving in E said no and that she was still planning on moving in to help her save some money because of how bad the housing market is rn. E thought that was the last of it but i didn't know bc she didn't tell her and M had that convo. well M calls me up and asks if i would be alright with them moving into the backyard. i heard out her situation (keep in mind her and my dad were the only two people i had contact with at this time so i didn't know everything else going on behind the scenes) and i decided i would be alright with her moving into the backyard to get away. well she told my dad everyone was ok with it and so he made the decision to let her move in and ended up screwing E over financially bc she puts a lot of money into the trailer that M tried selling for a very low number that my dad didn't agree to. anyways she moved in  and her and my dad made their own little arrangements and when i moved back they didn't account for me not being happy that she was walking into the house and using the amenities (aka kitchen) without even notifying me. not to mention my sisters wife will eat everything in our kitchen if you let her.

my dad chooses my sister M's side much more than me and my other sister. it is probably because both me and my sister openly defy and disagree with him especially politically but we are also not shy in arguing back when he's being unreasonable or unrealistic. my sister M uses a more placating and soft approach but all three of us are left leaning me being the most left out of the two. just all this to say we don't get along well.
*background over*

i went camping for a couple of days almost immediately after my dad took my family on vacation. we got home and i put all of my stuff into another bag and headed out to my friends house. his only stipulation for me going (reminder i am 20) was to do the dishes (i did) and then i left. i had no service the entire time i was up there (not like he was texting me while i was there anyways) but the last full day at the campsite i  twisted my ankle after slipping on some loose rocks. i went down hard and it hurt so bad. i didn't really rest it bc we were going to the lake that day so i went to the lake which had hard rock instead of sandy beaches and my bright idea was to get in the water bc i'm thinking it'll help my foot (spoiler alert it did not those rocks hurt). i was in a lot of pain after that so when we got back to the campsite i pretty much just crashed after taking some ibuprofen. the next morning (today) we had to fully take down camp and leave so i was walking on my foot for a large amount of the morning. we made the trip home and i was, and still am, covered in a layer of dirt from head to toe. i was so excited to go home bc i was exhausted and when i finally did get home my sister M's dog jumped on me and landed on my bad leg i set some stuff down and my dad and i exchanged basic pleasantries and then i led the dogs  over to the couch to say hello and give them some love. well my dad drops the bomb that we're having guests over tonight and when i asked who he listed a bunch of names and expected me to just know who he was talking about when i said that didn't clarify anything he laughs and explains they're friends and i'm like okkk and then he proceeds to ask me to help him clean the house up. mind you i literally just got home. i was exhausted dirty and had been sleeping on a very uncomfortable air mattress that most definitely fucked up my back even worse and with how much pain i was in i definitely snapped at him. i do regret snapping when he asked but i do not regret saying no. this conversation was like the second thing he talked to me about after me being home for less than 5 minutes. he hadn't asked me how the car ride was, how my trip was, or anything like that. in fact he hadn't even fucking hugged me yet. it hurts so bad to realise that my father doesn't have much interest in my life. idk maybe he just asked immediately because they were coming over soon but when i told him i couldn't help him he fully blew up on me. saying i always had something wrong when he needed help and that he had to clean up my bathroom himself bc i didn't do it.

*a little more background* when i was a kid i had a lot of stomach issues and my dad has never really believed me about them. my mom did but now with her gone there isn't a buffer between me and my dad. there were a lot of times where my dad would ask me to do a chore or something and i would tell him i wasn't feeling good. it was about 60/40 truth and lie bc as a kid i had an awful temper which i definitely got from both parents (side note i now know that these issues may root from untreated autism, bipolar or bpd but idk which bc my psychiatrist won't actually look into a diagnosis she's just been throwing meds at me so i stopped going) and i just never wanted to do chores. idk i was a brat i fully admit that but i am an adult now. *end background*

i hand wash all my dishes and yet still end up doing a lot of my dad and grandfathers dishes. i have kept the downstairs pretty much void of all my stuff except maybe one or two things and that's only when i'm actually downstairs but my dad acts like the mess is my fault. in fact he actually used to do that to my mom too. he blamed her for the mess and would constantly complain about her. my mother was a disabled SAHM. she had type two diabetes and had severe mental health issues along with other physical health issues. she couldn't do as much work and when he came home he would complain that it wasn't clean as if my mom was home all day to clean it. 9 out of 10 times she was not home and actually doing all the house shopping as well as looking after my nephews full time for many years until they both went to school and then she went to semi part time/semi full time with them depending on holidays. 

i am literally not lying when i say i got home around 1:08 and i left at 1:17 i barely was even home for 5 minutes when he asked and i spent the rest of that time in my room trying to figure out where to go bc it was all super overwhelming and i knew my dad was gonna have guests and idk what time they were going to be over so i just left. i went on a drive i drafted a text simply because i don't know how to talk to this man in person. do you know that type of person who you know is wrong but is so persuasive and makes themselves look so much better bc they're a ""charismatic"" white man? yeah that's my dad. anyways this is the text.

I apologise for taking my frustrations out on you today. it was uncalled for me to raise my voice like that. i know you don't like long paragraphs but this is not meant to be an attack i simply find it hard to talk in person sometimes so typing my thoughts out is a good way to get my head on straight and explain. yes i've refused to help out in the past with chores growing up. i apologise for being difficult when i was a kid and teen. i couldn't tell you why outside of i didn't want to or i was genuinely in pain or sick when you asked. recently i have been getting a system down that works for me with my pain level but it's been hard readjusting to being here. while two months might seem like a long time to get situated in reality two months goes by so fast. you haven't really lived with me full time since last year so yes while everything seems like it's the same it's not. i am simply trying to find my footing back in this house because it feels completely foreign to me. this house i came back to no longer feels like home. i know you want things to be clean i do too but to me the messy meant mom. i would prefer the messy house i grew up with any day over a perfectly clean one because that meant mom was there. this isn't necessarily healthy thinking but it's still a part of my grief. i'm having a hard time adjusting to being here with this new decor, new dynamic, new everything. when i came back here so much was changing/ had been changed and it threw me. it still is messing with my head as new things continue to pop up but i'm trying really hard to adjust. i was supposed to clean my bathroom last week but after working those long hours i was exhausted and in a lot of pain so cleaning couldn't really happen and with both of the trips back to back it was very hectic. yes i should have cleaned it before i left for my trip and i am sorry i couldn't but i had planned on cleaning it once i got back and unpacked from this trip. i had no idea you were having people over until today but if i had known before i left for my trip i would have cleaned it so it would have been ready. it is a little difficult when i am the only one designated to cleaning my bathroom even though everyone who enters our house uses it meaning cleaning it gets more and more frequent. i would really like it if maybe the boys also had that added onto things they help out with around the house because they make a lot of the mess too and it would be great to get help in cleaning it up. i am sorry for the way i told you no but i am not sorry for saying no. if i was in better position right now i wouldn't hesitate to say yes and help out with whatever you need but i have a responsibility to take care of myself and i haven't been doing that recently at all. i do understand the frustration of asking someone to help but them not helping and i apologise for how i said it. i have been trying to be as helpful as possible lately but i slip through the cracks sometimes and that's on me. i was walking on my foot all day yesterday after twisting it and all day today while tearing down the campsite and when i got home my only plan was to take a shower and then soak in the bath to help alleviate some of the pain so when instead of asking how the car ride was, or asking about how my trip went or asking to see all the pictures i took, you instead asked me to clean almost as soon as i got back it hurt to see you not interested. i understand you had no way of knowing what happened yesterday morning i am not blaming you for that i was just really hoping you were going to be interested about my trip because i thought that it would help our relationship. i notice that when you ask me about stuff that is only really interesting to me and i start talking there isn't a lot of times that i have your full attention or i end up getting interrupted by something/someone so i wanted to find something i knew you liked so we could have more conversations. i was just hoping to keep your attention for once. i want my dad. i don't want superman who fixes everything for everyone all the time and is constantly gone doing side quests i want my dad who wants to go out and spend time with me. like making dinner together or going to get coffee or maybe ice cream because you don't really drink coffee. i want to talk to you about the cool stuff that happened in my day and i want to hear about what is going on in your life outside of the ""oh my day was good thanks for asking"". when i ask that it's not me making small talk i actually want to know what's going on because there is so much stuff i find out from other people instead of you. you do tell me stuff but a lot of the time it comes up a while after even if i was here when it happened. i feel like i'm missing out on a lot. i hear you ariel and kira talking about things i don't understand constantly and it makes me feel very left out. cleaning is not what i was upset about it was the lack of interest in me. you didn't even hug me when i got home and no i didn't go to hug you because it was not the first thing on my mind after the dog jumped on my bad leg. i wanted to sit down and greet all of them but it doesn't mean i didn't want one especially after not being home for a couple of days. i had a good trip but i did a lot of grieving up there and it was a super emotional trip so i was excited to be back and to see you. i even went back to the general store we went to after **** bc that was at ***** and i was so excited when i realised i had been there with you. i realise my frustrations were not communicated properly so i'm fixing that now and letting you know what i was really upset about.
**

i'm currently outside my sisters house waiting for her to get home bc she said i could shower here but she's still 20 minutes away and it's 10:00pm so idk if i'm even showering tn. i don't even wanna go home. after our fight i went on a very long drive, had several mental breakdowns, cried, drank a shit ton of water, ate little to nothing, and have been sweating my ass off in this heat bc my car can't stay on too long. 

i miss my mom. one of the only reasons i stuck around was because of her and now i just really don't know how much i want my family in my life. i wish i could get them out but financially i'm tapped so i can't really do anything about my living situation so all i can do about it is complain. none of my worries or concerns are ever looked at as if they are real genuine concerns. he always looks at me like i'm crazy for thinking certain things are issues.

1ln6ovf,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ln6ovf/the_green_mile_stephen_king/,The Green Mile Stephen King:," THE TWO  
DEAD GIRLS  
 1  
 THIS HAPPENED in 1932, when the state penitentiary was still at Cold Mountain. And the electric chair was there, too, of course.  
  The inmates made jokes about the chair, the way people always make jokes about things that frighten them but can't be gotten away from. They called it Old Sparky, or the Big Juicy. They made cracks about the power bill, and how Warden Moores would cook his Thanksgiving dinner that fall, with his wife, Melinda, too sick to cook.  
  But for the ones who actually had to sit down in that chair, the humor went out of the situation in a hurry. I presided over seventy-eight executions during my time at Cold Mountain (that's one figure I've never been confused about; I'll remember it on my deathbed), and I think that, for most of those men, the truth of what was happening to them finally hit all the way home when their ankles were being clamped to the stout oak of ""Old Sparky's"" legs. The realization came then (you would see it rising in their eyes, a kind of cold dismay) that their own legs had finished their careers. The blood still ran in them, the muscles were still strong, but they were finished, all the same; they were never going to walk another country mile or dance with a girl at a barn-raising. Old Sparky's clients came to a knowledge of their deaths from the ankles up. There was a black silk bag that went over their heads after they had finished their rambling and mostly disjointed last remarks. It was supposed to be for them, but I always thought it was really for us, to keep us from seeing the awful tide of dismay in their eyes as they realized they were going to die with their knees bent.  
  
  There was no death row at Cold Mountain, only E Block, set apart from the other four and about a quarter their size, brick instead of wood, with a horrible bare metal roof that glared in the summer sun like a delirious eyeball. Six cells inside, three on each side of a wide center aisle, each almost twice as big as the cells in the other four blocks. Singles, too. Great accommodations for a prison (especially in the thirties), but the inmates would have traded for cells in any of the other four. Believe me, they would have traded.  
  
  There was never a time during my years as block superintendent when all six cells were occupied at one time--thank God for small favors. Four was the most, mixed black and white (at Cold Mountain, there was no segregation among the walking dead), and that was a little piece of hell. One was a woman, Beverly McCall. She was black as the ace of spades and as beautiful as the sin you never had nerve enough to commit. She put up with six years of her husband beating her, but wouldn't put up with his creeping around for a single day. On the evening after she found out he was cheating, she stood waiting for the unfortunate Lester McCall, known to his pals (and, presumably, to his extremely short-term mistress) as Cutter, at the top of the stairs leading to the apartment over his barber shop. She waited until he got his overcoat half off, then dropped his cheating guts onto his tu-tone shoes. Used one of Cutter's own razors to do it. Two nights before she was due to sit in Old Sparky, she called me to her cell and said she had been visited by her African spirit-father in a dream. He told her to discard her slave-name and to die under her free name, Matuomi. That was her request, that her death-warrant should be read under the name of Beverly Matuomi. I guess her spirit-father didn't give her any first name, or one she could make out, anyhow. I said yes, okay, fine. One thing those years serving as the bull-goose screw taught me was never to refuse the condemned unless I absolutely had to. In the case of Beverly Matuomi, it made no difference, anyway. The governor called the next day around three in the afternoon, commuting her sentence to life in the Grassy Valley Penal Facility for Women--all penal and no penis, we used to say back then. I was glad to see Bev's round ass going left instead of right when she got to the duty desk, let me tell you.  
  
  Thirty-five years or so later--had to be at least thirty-five--I saw that name on the obituary page of the paper, under a picture of a skinny-faced black lady with a cloud of white hair and glasses with rhinestones at the corners. It was Beverly. She'd spent the last ten years of her life a free woman, the obituary said, and had rescued the small-town library of Raines Falls pretty much single-handed. She had also taught Sunday school and had been much loved in that little backwater. LIBRARIAN DIES OF HEART FAILURE, the headline said, and below that, in smaller type, almost as an afterthought: Served Over Two Decades in Prison for Murder. Only the eyes, wide and blazing behind the glasses with the rhinestones at the corners, were the same. They were the eyes of a woman who even at seventy-whatever would not hesitate to pluck a safety razor from its blue jar of disinfectant, if the urge seemed pressing. You know murderers, even if they finish up as old lady librarians in dozey little towns. At least you do if you've spent as much time minding murderers as I did. There was only one time I ever had a question about the nature of my job. That, I reckon, is why I'm writing this.  
  
  The wide corridor up the center of E Block was floored with linoleum the color of tired old limes, and so what was called the Last Mile at other prisons was called the Green Mile at Cold Mountain. It ran, I guess, sixty long paces from south to north, bottom to top. At the bottom was the restraint room. At the top end was a T-junction. A left turn meant life--if you called what went on in the sunbaked exercise yard life, and many did; many lived it for years, with no apparent ill effects. Thieves and arsonists and sex criminals, all talking their talk and walking their walk and making their little deals.  
  
  A right turn, though--that was different. First you went into my office (where the carpet was also green, a thing I kept meaning to change and not getting around to), and crossed in front of my desk, which was flanked by the American flag on the left and the state flag on the right. On the far side were two doors. One led into the small W.C. that I and the E Block guards (sometimes even Warden Moores) used; the other opened on a kind of storage shed. This was where you ended up when you walked the Green Mile.  
  
  It was a small door--I had to duck my head when I went through, and John Coffey actually had to sit and scoot. You came out on a little landing, then went down three cement steps to a board floor. It was a miserable room without heat and with a metal roof, just like the one on the block to which it was an adjunct. It was cold enough in there to see your breath during the winter, and stifling in the summer. At the execution of Elmer Manfred--in July or August of '30, that one was, I believe--we had nine witnesses pass out.  
  
  On the left side of the storage shed--again--there was life. Tools (all locked down in frames crisscross  
ed with chains, as if they were carbine rifles instead of spades and pickaxes), dry goods, sacks of seeds for spring planting in the prison gardens, boxes of toilet paper, pallets cross-loaded with blanks for the prison plate-shop . . . even bags of lime for marking out the baseball diamond and the football gridiron--the cons played in what was known as The Pasture, and fall afternoons were greatly looked forward to at Cold Mountain.  
  
  On the right--once again--death. Old Sparky his ownself, sitting up on a plank platform at the southeast corner of the storeroom, stout oak legs, broad oak arms that had absorbed the terrorized sweat of scores of men in the last few minutes of their lives, and the metal cap, usually hung jauntily on the back of the chair, like some robot kid's beanie in a Buck Rogers comic-strip. A cord ran from it and through a gasket-circled hole in the cinderblock wall behind the chair. Off to one side was a galvanized tin bucket. If you looked inside it, you would see a circle of sponge, cut just right to fit the metal cap. Before executions, it was soaked in brine to better conduct the charge of direct-current electricity that ran through the wire, through the sponge, and into the condemned man's brain.  
  
  2  
  
  1932 WAS THE YEAR of John Coffey. The details would be in the papers, still there for anyone who cared enough to look them out--someone with more energy than one very old man whittling away the end of his life in a Georgia nursing home. That was a hot fall, I remember that; very hot, indeed. October almost like August, and the warden's wife, Melinda, up in the hospital at Indianola for a spell. It was the fall I had the worst urinary infection of my life, not bad enough to put me in the hospital myself, but almost bad enough for me to wish I was dead every time I took a leak. It was the fall of Delacroix, the little half-bald Frenchman with the mouse, the one that came in the summer and did that cute trick with the spool. Mostly, though, it was the fall that John Coffey came to E Block, sentenced to death for the rape-murder of the Detterick twins.  
There were four or five guards on the block each shift, but a lot of them were floaters. Dean Stanton, Harry Terwilliger, and Brutus Howell (the men called him ""Brutal,"" but it was a joke, he wouldn't hurt a fly unless he had to, in spite of his size) are all dead now, and so is Percy Wetmore, who really was brutal . . . not to mention stupid. Percy had no business on E Block, where an ugly nature was useless and sometimes dangerous, but he was related to the governor by marriage, and so he stayed.  
  
  It was Percy Wetmore who ushered Coffey onto the block, with the supposedly traditional cry of ""Dead man walking! Dead man walking here!""  
  
  It was still as hot as the hinges of hell, October or not. The door to the exercise yard opened, letting in a flood of brilliant light and the biggest man I've ever seen, except for some of the basketball fellows they have on the TV down in the ""Resource Room"" of this home for wayward droolers I've finished up in. He wore chains on his arms and across his water-barrel of a chest; he wore legirons on his ankles and shuffled a chain between them that sounded like cascading coins as it ran along the lime-colored corridor between the cells. Percy Wetmore was on one side of him, skinny little Harry Terwilliger was on the other, and they looked like children walking along with a captured bear. Even Brutus Howell looked like a kid next to Coffey, and Brutal was over six feet tall and broad as well, a football tackle who had gone on to play at LSU until he flunked out and came back home to the ridges.  
  
  John Coffey was black, like most of the men who came to stay for awhile in E Block before dying in Old Sparky's lap, and he stood six feet, eight inches tall. He wasn't all willowy like the TV basketball fellows, though--he was broad in the shoulders and deep through the chest, laced over with muscle in every direction. They'd put him in the biggest denims they could find in Stores, and still the cuffs of the pants rode halfway up on his bunched and scarred calves. The shirt was open to below his chest, and the sleeves stopped somewhere on his forearms. He was holding his cap in one huge hand, which was just as well; perched on his bald mahogany ball of a head, it would have looked like the kind of cap an organ-grinder's monkey wears, only blue instead of red. He looked like he could have snapped the chains that held him as easily as you might snap the ribbons on a Christmas present, but when you looked in his face, you knew he wasn't going to do anything like that. It wasn't dull--although that was what Percy thought, it wasn't long before Percy was calling him the ijit--but lost. He kept looking around as if to make out where he was. Maybe even who he was. My first thought was that he looked like a black Samson . . . only after Delilah had shaved him smooth as her faithless little hand and taken all the fun out of him.  
  
  ""Dead man walking!"" Percy trumpeted, hauling on that bear of a man's wristcuff, as if he really believed he could move him if Coffey decided he didn't want to move anymore on his own. Harry didn't say anything, but he looked embarrassed. ""Dead man--""  
  
  ""That'll be enough of that,"" I said. I was in what was going to be Coffey's cell, sitting on his bunk. I'd known he was coming, of course, was there to welcome him and take charge of him, but had no idea of the man's pure size until I saw him. Percy gave me a look that said we all knew I was an asshole (except for the big dummy, of course, who only knew how to rape and murder little girls), but he didn't say anything.  
  
  The three of them stopped outside the cell door, which was standing open on its track. I nodded to Harry, who said: ""Are you sure you want to be in there with him, boss?"" I didn't often hear Harry Terwilliger sound nervous--he'd been right there by my side during the riots of six or seven years before and had never wavered, even when the rumors that some of them had guns began to circulate--but he sounded nervous then.  
  
  ""Am I going to have any trouble with you, big boy?"" I asked, sitting there on the bunk and trying not to look or sound as miserable as I felt--that urinary infection I mentioned earlier wasn't as bad as it eventually got, but it was no day at the beach, let me tell you.  
  
  Coffey shook his head slowly--once to the left, once to the right, then back to dead center. Once his eyes found me, they never left me.  
  
  Harry had a clipboard with Coffey's forms on it in one hand. ""Give it to him,"" I said to Harry. ""Put it in his hand.""  
  
  Harry did. The big mutt took it like a sleepwalker.  
  
  ""Now bring it to me, big boy,"" I said, and Coffey did, his chains jingling and rattling. He had to duck his head just to enter the cell.  
  
  I looked up and down mostly to register his height as a fact and not an optical illusion. It was real: six feet, eight inches. His weight was given as two-eighty, but I think that was only an estimate; he had to have been three hundred and twenty, maybe as much as three hundred and fifty pounds. Under the space for scars and identifying marks, one word had been blocked out in the laborious printing of Magnusson, the old trusty in Registration: Numerous.  
  
  I looked up. Coffey had shuffled a bit to one side and I could see Harry standing across the corridor in front of Delacroix's cell--he was our only other prisoner in E Block when Coffey came in. Del was a slight, balding man with the worried face of an accountant who knows his embezzlement will soon be discovered. His tame mouse was sitting on his shoulder.  
  
  Percy Wetmore was leaning in the doorway of the cell which had just become John Coffey's. He had taken his hickory baton out of the custom-made holster he carried it in, and was tapping it against one palm the way a man does when he has a toy he wants to use. And all at once I couldn't stand to have him there. Maybe it was the unseasonable heat, maybe it was the urinary infection heating up my groin and making the itch of my flannel underwear all but unbearable, maybe it was knowing that the state had sent me a black man next door to an idiot to execute, and Percy clearly wanted to hand-tool him a little first. Probably it was all those things. Whatever it was, I stopped caring about his political connections for a little while.  
  
  ""Percy,"" I said. ""They're moving house over in the infirmary.""  
  
  ""Bill Dodge is in charge of that detail--""  
  
  ""I know he is,"" I said. ""Go and help him.""  
  
  ""That isn't my job,"" Percy said. ""This big lugoon is my job."" ""Lugoon"" was Percy's joke name for the big ones--a combination of lug and goon. He resented the big ones. He wasn't skinny, like Harry Terwilliger, but he was short. A banty-rooster sort of guy, the kind that likes to pick fights, especially when the odds are all their way. And vain about his hair. Could hardly keep his hands off it.  
  
  ""Then your job is done,"" I said. ""Get over to the infirmary.""  
  
  His lower lip pooched out. Bill Dodge and his men were moving boxes and stacks of sheets, even the beds; the whole infirmary was going to a new frame building over on the west side of the prison. Hot work, heavy lifting. Percy Wetmore wanted no part of either.  
  
  ""They got all the men they need,"" he said.  
  
  ""Then get over there and straw-boss,"" I said, raising my voice. I saw Harry wince and paid no attention. If the governor ordered Warden Moores to fire me for ruffling the wrong set of feathers, who was Hal Moores going to put in my place? Percy? It was a joke. ""I really don't care what you do, Percy, as long as you get out of here for awhile.""  
  
  For a moment I thought he was going to stick and there'd be real trouble, with Coffey standing there the whole time like the world's biggest stopped clock. Then Percy rammed his billy back into its hand-tooled holster--foolish damned vanitorious thing--and went stalking up the corridor. I don't remember which guard was sitting at the duty desk that day--one of the floaters, I guess--but Percy must not have liked the way he looked, because he growled, ""You wipe that smirk off your shitepoke face or I'll wipe it off for you"" as he went by. There was a rattle of keys, a momentary blast of hot sunlight from the exercise yard, and then Percy Wetmore was gone, at least for the time being. Delacroix's mouse ran back and forth from one of the little Frenchman's shoulders to the other, his filament whiskers twitching.  
  
  ""Be still, Mr. Jingles,"" Delacroix said, and the mouse stopped on his left shoulder just as if he had understood. ""Just be so still and so quiet."" In Delacroix's lilting Cajun accent,  
quiet came out sounding exotic and foreign--kwaht.  
  
  ""You go lie down, Del,"" I said curtly. ""Take you a rest. This is none of your business, either.""  
  
  He did as I said. He had raped a young girl and killed her, and had then dropped her body behind the apartment house where she lived, doused it with coal-oil, and then set it on fire, hoping in some muddled way to dispose of the evidence of his crime. The fire had spread to the building itself, had engulfed it, and six more people had died, two of them children. It was the only crime he had in him, and now he was just a mild-mannered man with a worried face, a bald pate, and long hair straggling over the back of his shirt-collar. He would sit down with Old Sparky in a little while, and Old Sparky would make an end to him . . . but whatever it was that had done that awful thing was already gone, and now he lay on his bunk, letting his little companion run squeaking over his hands. In a way, that was the worst; Old Sparky never burned what was inside them, and the drugs they inject them with today don't put it to sleep. It vacates, jumps to someone else, and leaves us to kill husks that aren't really alive anyway.  
  
  I turned my attention to the giant.  
  
  ""If I let Harry take those chains off you, are you going to be nice?""  
  
  He nodded. It was like his head-shake: down, up, back to center. His strange eyes looked at me. There was a kind of peace in them, but not a kind I was sure I could trust. I crooked a finger to Harry, who came in and unlocked the chains. He showed no fear now, even when he knelt between Coffey's treetrunk legs to unlock the ankle irons, and that eased me some. It was Percy who had made Harry nervous, and I trusted Harry's instincts. I trusted the instincts of all my day-to-day E Block men, except for Percy.  
  
  I have a little set speech I make to men new on the block, but I hesitated with Coffey, because he seemed so abnormal, and not just in his size.  
  
  When Harry stood back (Coffey had remained motionless during the entire unlocking ceremony, as placid as a Percheron), I looked up at my new charge, tapping on the clipboard with my thumb, and said: ""Can you talk, big boy?""  
  
  ""Yes, sir, boss, I can talk,"" he said. His voice was a deep and quiet rumble. It made me think of a freshly tuned tractor engine. He had no real Southern drawl--he said I, not Ah--but there was a kind of Southern construction to his speech that I noticed later. As if he was from the South, but not of it. He didn't sound illiterate, but he didn't sound educated. In his speech as in so many other things, he was a mystery. Mostly it was his eyes that troubled me--a kind of peaceful absence in them, as if he were floating far, far away.  
  
  ""Your name is John Coffey.""  
  
  ""Yes, sir, boss, like the drink, only not spelled the same way.""  
  
  ""So you can spell, can you? Read and write?""  
  
  ""Just my name, boss,"" said he, serenely.  
  
  I sighed, then gave him a short version of my set speech. I'd already decided he wasn't going to be any trouble. In that I was both right and wrong.  
  
  ""My name is Paul Edgecombe,"" I said. ""I'm the E Block super--the head screw. You want something from me, ask for me by name. If I'm not here, ask this other man--his name is Harry Terwilliger. Or you ask for Mr. Stanton or Mr. Howell. Do you understand that?""  
  
  Coffey nodded.  
  
  ""Just don't expect to get what you want unless we decide it's what you need--this isn't a hotel. Still with me?""  
  
  He nodded again.  
  
  ""This is a quiet place, big boy--not like the rest of the prison. It's just you and Delacroix over there. You won't work; mostly you'll just sit. Give you a chance to think things over."" Too much time for most of them, but I didn't say that. ""Sometimes we play the radio, if all's in order. You like the radio?""  
  
  He nodded, but doubtfully, as if he wasn't sure what the radio was. I later found out that was true, in a way; Coffey knew things when he encountered them again, but in between he forgot. He knew the characters on Our Gal Sunday, but had only the haziest memory of what they'd been up to the last time.  
  
  ""If you behave, you'll eat on time, you'll never see the solitary cell down at the far end, or have to wear one of those canvas coats that buttons up the back. You'll have two hours in the yard afternoons from four until six, except on Saturdays when the rest of the prison population has their flag football games. You'll have your visitors on Sunday afternoons, if you have someone who wants to visit you. Do you, Coffey?""  
  
  He shook his head. ""Got none, boss,"" he said.  
  
  ""Well, your lawyer, then.""  
  
  ""I believe I've seen the back end of him,"" he said. ""He was give to me on loan. Don't believe he could find his way up here in the mountains.""  
  
  I looked at him closely to see if he might be trying a little joke, but he didn't seem to be. And I really hadn't expected any different. Appeals weren't for the likes of John Coffey, not back then; they had their day in court and then the world forgot them until they saw a squib in the paper saying a certain fellow had taken a little electricity along about midnight. But a man with a wife, children, or friends to look forward to on Sunday afternoons was easier to control, if control looked to be a problem. Here it didn't, and that was good. Because he was so damned big.  
  
  I shifted a little on the bunk, then decided I might feel a little more comfortable in my nether parts if I stood up, and so I did. He backed away from me respectfully, and clasped his hands in front of him.  
  
  ""Your time here can be easy or hard, big boy, it all depends on you. I'm here to say you might as well make it easy on all of us, because it comes to the same in the end. We'll treat you as right as you deserve. Do you have any questions?""  
  
  ""Do you leave a light on after bedtime?"" he asked right away, as if he had only been waiting for the chance.  
  
  I blinked at him. I had been asked a lot of strange questions by newcomers to E Block--once about the size of my wife's tits--but never that one.  
  
  Coffey was smiling a trifle uneasily, as if he knew we would think him foolish but couldn't help himself. ""Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes,"" he said. ""If it's a strange place.""  
  
  I looked at him--the pure size of him--and felt strangely touched. They did touch you, you know; you didn't see them at their worst, hammering out their horrors like demons at a forge.  
  
  ""Yes, it's pretty bright in here all night long,"" I said. ""Half the lights along the Mile burn from nine until five every morning."" Then I realized he wouldn't have any idea of what I was talking about--he didn't know the Green Mile from Mississippi mud--and so I pointed. ""In the corridor.""  
  
  He nodded, relieved. I'm not sure he knew what a corridor was, either, but he could see the 200-watt bulbs in their wire cages.  
  
  I did something I'd never done to a prisoner before, then--I offered him my hand. Even now I don't know why. Him asking about the lights, maybe. It made Harry Terwilliger blink, I can tell you that. Coffey took my hand with surprising gentleness, my hand all but disappearing into his, and that was all of it. I had another moth in my killing bottle. We were done.  
  
  I stepped out of the cell. Harry pulled the door shut on its track and ran both locks. Coffey stood where he was a moment or two longer, as if he didn't know what to do next, and then he sat down on his bunk, clasped his giant's hands between his knees, and lowered his head like a man who grieves or prays. He said something then in his strange, almost-Southern voice. I heard it with perfect clarity, and although I didn't know much about what he'd done then--you don't need to know about what a man's done in order to feed him and groom him until it's time for him to pay off what he owes--it still gave me a chill.  
  
  ""I couldn't help it, boss,"" he said. ""I tried to take it back, but it was too late.""  
  
  3  
  
  ""YOU'RE GOING to have you some trouble with Percy,"" Harry said as we walked back up the hall and into my office. Dean Stanton, sort of my third in command--we didn't actually have such things, a situation Percy Wetmore would have fixed up in a flash--was sitting behind my desk, updating the files, a job I never seemed to get around to. He barely looked up as we came in, just gave his little glasses a shove with the ball of his thumb and dived back  
into his paperwork.  
  
  ""I been having trouble with that peckerwood since the day he came here,"" I said, gingerly, pulling my pants away from my crotch and wincing. ""Did you hear what he was shouting when he brought that big galoot down?""  
  
  ""Couldn't very well not,"" Harry said. ""I was there, you know.""  
  
  ""I was in the john and heard it just fine,"" Dean said. He drew a sheet of paper to him, held it up into the light so I could see there was a coffee-ring as well as typing on it, and then tossed it into the waste basket. "" 'Dead man walking.' Must have read that in one of those magazines he likes so much.""  
  
  And he probably had. Percy Wetmore was a great reader of Argosy and Stag and Men's Adventure. There was a prison tale in every issue, it seemed, and Percy read them avidly, like a man doing research. It was like he was trying to find out how to act, and thought the information was in those magazines. He'd come just after we did Anthony Ray, the hatchet-killer--and he hadn't actually participated in an execution yet, although he'd witnessed one from the switch-room.  
  
  ""He knows people,"" Harry said. ""He's connected. You'll have to answer for sending him off the block, and you'll have to answer even harder for expecting him to do some real work.""  
  
  ""I don't expect it,"" I said, and I didn't . . . but I had hopes. Bill Dodge wasn't the sort to let a man just stand around and do the heavy looking-on. ""I'm more interested in the big boy, for the time being. Are we going to have trouble with him?""  
  
  Harry shook his head with decision.  
  
  ""He was quiet as a lamb at court down there in Trapingus County,"" Dean said. He took his little rimless glasses off and began to polish them on his vest. ""Of course they had more chains on him than Scrooge saw on Marley's ghost, but he could have kicked up dickens if he'd wanted. That's a pun, son.""  
  
  ""I know,"" I said, although I didn't. I just hate letting Dean Stanton get the better of me.

I was at the office, sitting in a cabin with a girl I had known since our interview. We had actually decided to join on the same date. We were busy filling out some forms when she excused herself to use the washroom.

A while later, after she returned, a guy suddenly walked into our cabin. He saw us working on the forms and asked, “Are you guys freshers?” We nodded in agreement. He leaned in, extended his hand, and said, “Hi, I’m ....” Then, turning to the girl, he added, “We should catch up later. Why don’t you join me for a coffee?” And just like that, he walked out.

The girl rolled her eyes and said, “He’s such a chape."" Apparently, she had only asked him for directions to the washroom and the guy followed her all the way back just because he saw a new girl had joined.

For those who don't know, chape is a Hindi slang word most common in Delhi-NCR. It means someone who is clingy, desperate for attention or trying too hard to impress. ",42,1751173879.0,IndianWorkplace,5,1.0,False

1ln6iqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/motivation/comments/1ln6iqs/how_i_stopped_being_a_complete_loser_and_actually/,How I Stopped Being a Complete Loser and Actually Started Winning at Life (After 3 Years of Being a Disappointment),"I was 23, living in my mom's basement, and hadn't left the house in 4 days straight. My friends were getting promotions, relationships, and respect while I was refreshing the same 3 websites for 8 hours daily.

I was the guy everyone felt sorry for. The one people stopped inviting to things because they knew I'd make excuses anyway.

Then I had a moment that changed everything. A moment so brutal it forced me to either change or accept being a failure forever.

My younger brother brought his girlfriend over for dinner. As we sat around the table, she asked what I did for work. The silence was deafening. My mom jumped in with some bullsh\*t excuse about me ""figuring things out.""

Later that night, I heard them talking in his room. She said, ""I feel bad for your brother. He seems so... lost.""

That word hit me like a truck. Lost.

I wasn't just lazy. I wasn't just going through a rough patch. I was lost, and everyone could see it except me.

Instead of wallowing (my usual move), I asked myself something different:

**""What kind of man do I want to be when I'm 30?""**

Not what I wanted to achieve. Not what goals I had. What kind of **person** I wanted to be.

The answer came immediately: Someone people respect. Someone who keeps his word. Someone who doesn't make excuses.

Then I asked the follow-up question:

**""What kind of man will I be at 30 if I keep living like this?""**

The answer made my stomach drop. I'd be the same loser, just older. Still making excuses. Still disappointing everyone, including myself.

Here's what I did (and why it works when everything else fails):

1. I picked ONE thing. Not a morning routine. Not 5 habits. ONE thing: Make my bed every morning. Why this works: Your brain can't argue with something so stupidly simple.
2. I made it non-negotiable. Bad day? Make the bed. Sick? Make the bed. Hungover? Make the bed. Why this works: Consistency builds identity. ""I'm someone who always makes his bed"" becomes part of who you are.
3. I celebrated small wins. Day 7 of making my bed? I bought myself a coffee. Day 30? New sheets. Just made me happy over all.
4. Added habits after a month 2: Bed + 10 pushups. Month 3: Bed + pushups + read 5 pages. Why this works: You build on success, not failure. Each habit makes the next one easier.
5. I wrote my ""anti-vision"". I wrote a detailed description of my life at 30 if I changed nothing. Reading it every morning. It was painful but sure did give me the drive to do hard things.

After 90 days of this system:

* People started treating me differently (with actual respect)
* I got offered a job through a connection who noticed my ""new energy""
* My family stopped making excuses for me (really happy about this one)
* I felt like a man instead of a boy for the first time in years

If I can do it so you too.

Stevie got out of the car and stretched her stiff limbs. It had been a long drive, and she was ready to sit down and relax for the rest of the day. Unfortunately, the boxes in the boot of the car beckoned to be taken inside and unpacked. Letting out a sigh, Stevie grabbed her keys and unlocked the front door before starting to bring in all the boxes.

Stevie moved out here to be closer to her aunt Anica. After losing both of her parents Stevie didn’t feel like being in her hometown anymore. There was nothing left for her in that small town. Moving out here would give her a fresh start at least Stevie hoped that it would. Placing down the last box in the living room she shut the door and plopped down onto the couch.

The slight hum of the AC in the background began to lull her to sleep. It had been a long drive after all and who knows when she would get another nap like this again. Stevie closed her eyes falling asleep. Knocking on her front door made her jolt awake as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes. She stood up and walked over to the door peering through the peep hole.

There standing in the automatic porchlight was her aunt Anica with a small box in her hands.

Why was she here so late? Usually, she would call to let her know she was coming over. Yet here she was standing on her porch in the middle of the night. A very strange smile on her face…Stevie slowly opened the door. “Aunt Anica what brings you here this late?” she asked looking at the woman in front of her. Anica’s smile faltered for a bit before spreading back onto her lips “I just couldn’t wait to give you this welcome gift.” She patted the box shoving it into Stevie’s hands.

Fumbling with the box she looked at her aunt who had taken a step back. “Well…uh thank you but you didn’t have to.” Stevie mumbled. Anica let out a soft chuckle continuing to back away “Oh no dear…thank you for taking it off my hands.” She watched the woman hurriedly walk down the drive and into her waiting car. Stevie stood there dumbfounded as she glanced down at the box in her hands.

Why had Aunt Anica been so adamant about giving her this **gift**?

Whatever it was Stevie guessed her aunt was afraid that she would misplace it. Not that Anica was the type to lose anything considering how well organized she was. What exactly had been pawned off on her? Shutting the door Stevie walked over to the couch sitting on the arm of it and carefully opened the box. Inside was your typical porcelain doll except for a marking on its cheek that appeared to be a beauty mark or a tiny crack.

Sighing she played with the curls before setting the doll and its box aside on the couch. Stevie would find a place for the doll tomorrow. After all she had a lot of unpacking to do anyway so it would not hurt to wait to display the gift. Glancing at the doll Stevie closed the lid to its box. There was just something about this doll that made her uneasy, but she could not let it phase her.

The following day as Stevie goes to make coffee she lets out a surprised gasp seeing the doll on the counter. She knew that she did not leave the doll there. Maybe she was so tired that she was seeing things. Right? At least that is what she wanted to believe anyway.

Picking up the doll Stevie took it to the living room and places the doll on the bookshelf.

She goes back to the kitchen and makes her coffee. Adding her milk and sips the divine liquid of the gods and sighs happily. From her spot leaning against the counter Stevie studied the doll in curiosity. Stevie knew that she had never slept walk before so surely, she could not have moved the doll. Anica her aunt could not have come in during the night since she did not have a key.

The doll itself could not have moved on its own…

It was not one of those which could. The doll was made of porcelain, and its limbs unbendable.

So how was it able to move on its own? Finishing her coffee, she headed to her bedroom taking a well-deserved shower and got dressed to go for a jog. It was an opportunity to get a look at the neighborhood she lived in. Hopefully, this would also help clear her head. Dolls did not move on their own.

It was around lunch time when Stevie walked back in through the door. Her eyes going to the bookshelf where the doll was supposed to be. She was missing…where was she at now? Looking around the living room from top to bottom, and even under the couch she could not find her. Stevie stepped into the kitchen hands placed on her hips raising her head she looked up on top of the fridge.

Had she placed the doll there? But she could have sworn she placed her on the bookshelf. Or maybe Stevie had not and put her on the fridge instead. After all she did come in here to make her coffee. So maybe absent mindedly Stevie had placed her up there instead.

Shaking her head she sighed pinching the bridge of her nose with a thumb and index finger.

Stevie had never been forgetful before but maybe the move was finally taking its toll on her.

Reaching up she took the doll down from the fridge and placed it back onto the bookshelf and began to unpack a few boxes. She placed her book collection onto the shelf along with the doll propping it up in place. Stevie thought that if she put something around the doll the if it moved on its own, she would be able to hear it. That was the plan anyway and she hoped it would work. However, that night when Stevie had been sleeping three loud thuds hitting hardwood floor made her sit upright in bed heart thumping wildly that it made her ears thrum.

The bed creaked as Stevie swung her legs over the edge and stood up grabbing the baseball bat she kept by the bed. She slowly made her way out of the bedroom, and down the stairs. Stevie squinted her eyes peering into the living room. On the floor her books were scattered around with the doll nowhere to be seen. She perked up her ears and listened closely.

Stevie could hear the faint sound of skittering moving around the first floor. When something brushed past her legs and up the stairs, she screamed losing her balance and fell down the rest of the way hit her head at the bottom. Her vision went dark…when she woke up Stevie had a sizeable bump on her head and a swollen ankle. Had she been knocked out all night? As she blearily looked around squinting her eyes at the bright sunlight shining through the curtains.

Looking up at the stairs she gasped seeing the doll sitting there looking down at her. Stevie scooted backwards her back hitting the wall. Wincing in pain at both her head and ankle. There was something up with this **doll** that her aunt Anica had given her. Pulling herself up Stevie limped over to the doll snatching it up and carried it to a hall closet where she placed it onto a top shelf closing the door.

Stevie began her day by having a quick breakfast and tended to her injuries. As she nursed a cup of coffee, she called a friend of hers who was an expert in haunted and possessed objects. Maybe  he would have answers to her questions. Picking up her phone she called Eris an expert in haunted objects. He had always warned her not to pick up anything old or if it ever gave her a bad feeling.

She told him that her aunt Anica gave her this **doll** when she arrived in town. That she seemed hesitant about making her accept it. Eris told her that without seeing it in person there would be no one he would know for sure. That she should still make precautions to protect herself. Stevie almost laughed at this until she remembered that the doll had tripped her making her fall down the stairs.

Stevie could have literally died last night. She agreed that she would and ended the call. Looking up from her phone that doll was there sitting upright in the living room. Dropping her coffee cup it shattered onto the hardwood floor. Stevie cursed as she moved around the mess to grab some paper towels to clean it up.

When she was done Stevie placed the doll back into the closet placing a chair under the knob.

Just to make sure the doll could not get out.

It wouldn’t be able to, right?

If nothing else maybe it would help her sleep better tonight. Stevie went through the rest of her day. Trying to put the doll out of her mind, and what happened last night. Though her limping and throbbing head was an annoying reminder that it had happened. Stevie wished that she hadn’t accepted that doll from her aunt in the first place.

Later that night she settled into bed. Her head had stopped hurting but the throbbing in her ankle was still there. Stevie probably should have gone to the clinic near the house, but she was stubborn. Plus, she didn’t think that “*a doll tripped me last night”* would be a good reason to be seen. If it got worse, she would go and say she was moving furniture because she had recently moved.

As Stevie drifted off to sleep that was when the nightmares began. In this nightmare she was being chased down a long corridor. Stevie was running and kept looking over her shoulder. Yet every time she tried to get a good look at what was behind her the lights would go out. The figure would be easily blended into the darkness surrounding them keeping their form a secret.

Stevie gasped awake her heart hammering against her chest. As she shifted into a sitting position, she saw it… there sitting on a foot stool across from her was the **doll**. Stevie slowly laid back down pulling the covers up over her head. She squeezed her eyes tightly pursing her lips together slowly the lump in her throat. *“Please go away…”* she thought to herself.

In the morning, she found herself inside one of the many cafés that littered a downtown plaza staring into her empty coffee cup. There were prominent dark circles under her eyes. Stevie honestly felt that her energy had been sapped from her. This had to do with the doll there was no doubt about it. She needed to contact her aunt.

That woman had pawned the doll off on her, so she had to know something about it. There was no way Stevie was going to let Anica run away from this. She gave her a call and set up a location to meet her. When her Anica saw her niece, she lowered her head in shame the smile disappearing from her face. “I think you know what I’m here to talk to you about auntie.” Stevie gave a sideways smile taking a seat across from her.

“M-my goodness Stevie…you look very tired are you no–“

“Cut the crap auntie…”

Ancia frowned and folded her hands in front of her. She began to tell her niece about where she found the doll. It was at an estate sale an old house had been bought by the bank since it had gone unclaimed for years. A lot of the stuff they took out was still in good condition. When Anica’s eyes fell on that doll, she absolutely had to have it.

When she first brought it home things were normal, but then things began to be miss placed. Including the doll itself and it wasn’t always where Anica had left it. Then she began to have strange **accidents** happen in the house. Like falling down the stairs, almost stepping on broken glass and being electrocuted. Anica thought that she may have been hexed until the night she saw the doll scurry across the floor.

That was when she started losing sleep herself, and soon after the nightmares. So, Anica packed up the doll and put it into the undercroft of the stairs. When she got wind that Stevie was going to be moving into the same town Anica knew what she had to do. Her aunt’s eyes teared up as she placed a hand onto her niece’s hand who pulled it away. “Who was running the estate sale where you got the doll?” Stevie cleared her throat holding back a sob.

 

Anica dug through her purse and precured a card placing it onto the table. Stevie stood taking it and went on her way. Her aunt Ancia had pawned the doll off on her to save her own skin. That way she wouldn’t have sleepless nights, nightmares, or accidents. Instead, she would rather it happen to someone else.

Even if it meant that it was someone close to her…

Stevie arrived at the address on the business card. An older man was setting things out on display for the estate sale for the day. Their eyes met and he gave her a friendly smile and a wave. She took out her cellphone showing him a picture of the doll asking if he had seen this doll before. His smile faltered into a frown “Where did you get that doll?” he seemed uneasy and wiped his hands on his pants.

“My aunt bought it here” Stevie motioned to the building.

The man shook his head “It wasn’t supposed to be sold.”  he pointed at the picture.

“That **doll** is cursed…”

According to this owner of the estate sale a medium was supposed to pick the doll up. That he told his workers not to sell it, and some how it ended up on display with the rest of the dolls.

“If you have it…” he paused clearing his throat.

“Give it to the medium and get yourself cleansed.”

She paled putting her phone away wondering what kind of curse it was that was inhabiting the doll, but that was a question she would have to ask the medium their self. Stevie thanked him for the information and headed home to get the doll. She was glad to be getting rid of it. When she entered her home however the air felt stifling even with the AC on. The walls themselves creaked as she walked inside seeming to pull in towards her.

“Where the hell are you…” Stevie whispered aloud to herself looking around for the doll.

Her bedroom door creaked open from upstairs, and whispers flowed down into the living room. She knew it was trying lure her up there and that her problem wouldn’t go away until she got this doll out of her house. Grabbing the baseball bat she left downstairs from the night she fell Stevie headed upstairs a step at a time. Standing in the hallway she had full view of her bedroom. There on the bed was sitting the doll.

However, its appearance had changed…

Its clothing was darkened stained with something that Stevie could only assume was old blood.

The once pristine porcelain face was cracked and out of the cracks spewed a black swirling mist.

This thing was pure evil, and the bat she carried would not be enough to stop it.

Stevie leaned her bat against the wall and grabbed a pillowcase from the hall closet. Opening it up she pulled it down over the doll scooping it up and closed the end. Going down the stairs with it the doll thrashed about in the pillowcase in her hands. Just like her friend had told her Stevie needed to get this doll to a medium. She was out the door and in her car with the doll in a tied-up pillow sitting in the passenger seat.

Stevie found the closet medium and knocked in their door. The doll in her arms having gone still.

A woman opened the door giving her a once over before beckoning her inside. Stevie placed the doll where the medium told her do and she began her work. The doll was sealed inside a special type of wooden box and talismans were placed on the outside. When the medium approached Stevie again it was to put her through a series of steps in a cleansing ritual. She was told to leave the doll in her care, and she would see that it would be disposed of.

Stevie’s mind was at ease…at least for now.

One night as Stevie came in from doing a late-night snack run. She was gathering up her bags to head inside. When she had spotted something on her front steps. It was a wooden box with talismans placed all over it. All the seams were filled in with black wax.

Now the box was open…the lid laying off to the side.

Stevie knew that the doll was free, and she knew that it was hiding.

What exactly had been pawned off on her? Shutting the door Stevie walked over to the couch sitting on the arm of it and carefully opened the box. Inside was your typical porcelain doll except for a marking on its cheek that appeared to be a beauty mark or a tiny crack.

Sighing she played with the curls before setting the doll and its box aside on the couch. Stevie would find a place for the doll tomorrow. After all she had a lot of unpacking to do anyway so it would not hurt to wait to display the gift. Glancing at the doll Stevie closed the lid to its box. There was just something about this doll that made her uneasy, but she could not let it phase her.

The following day as Stevie goes to make coffee she lets out a surprised gasp seeing the doll on the counter. She knew that she did not leave the doll there. Maybe she was so tired that she was seeing things. Right? At least that is what she wanted to believe anyway.

Picking up the doll Stevie took it to the living room and places the doll on the bookshelf.

She goes back to the kitchen and makes her coffee. Adding her milk and sips the divine liquid of the gods and sighs happily. From her spot leaning against the counter Stevie studied the doll in curiosity. Stevie knew that she had never slept walk before so surely, she could not have moved the doll. Anica her aunt could not have come in during the night since she did not have a key.

The doll itself could not have moved on its own…

It was not one of those which could. The doll was made of porcelain, and its limbs unbendable.

So how was it able to move on its own? Finishing her coffee, she headed to her bedroom taking a well-deserved shower and got dressed to go for a jog. It was an opportunity to get a look at the neighborhood she lived in. Hopefully, this would also help clear her head. Dolls did not move on their own.

It was around lunch time when Stevie walked back in through the door. Her eyes going to the bookshelf where the doll was supposed to be. She was missing…where was she at now? Looking around the living room from top to bottom, and even under the couch she could not find her. Stevie stepped into the kitchen hands placed on her hips raising her head she looked up on top of the fridge.

Had she placed the doll there? But she could have sworn she placed her on the bookshelf. Or maybe Stevie had not and put her on the fridge instead. After all she did come in here to make her coffee. So maybe absent mindedly Stevie had placed her up there instead.

Shaking her head she sighed pinching the bridge of her nose with a thumb and index finger.

Stevie had never been forgetful before but maybe the move was finally taking its toll on her.

Reaching up she took the doll down from the fridge and placed it back onto the bookshelf and began to unpack a few boxes. She placed her book collection onto the shelf along with the doll propping it up in place. Stevie thought that if she put something around the doll the if it moved on its own, she would be able to hear it. That was the plan anyway and she hoped it would work. However, that night when Stevie had been sleeping three loud thuds hitting hardwood floor made her sit upright in bed heart thumping wildly that it made her ears thrum.

The bed creaked as Stevie swung her legs over the edge and stood up grabbing the baseball bat she kept by the bed. She slowly made her way out of the bedroom, and down the stairs. Stevie squinted her eyes peering into the living room. On the floor her books were scattered around with the doll nowhere to be seen. She perked up her ears and listened closely.

Stevie could hear the faint sound of skittering moving around the first floor. When something brushed past her legs and up the stairs, she screamed losing her balance and fell down the rest of the way hit her head at the bottom. Her vision went dark…when she woke up Stevie had a sizeable bump on her head and a swollen ankle. Had she been knocked out all night? As she blearily looked around squinting her eyes at the bright sunlight shining through the curtains.

Looking up at the stairs she gasped seeing the doll sitting there looking down at her. Stevie scooted backwards her back hitting the wall. Wincing in pain at both her head and ankle. There was something up with this **doll** that her aunt Anica had given her. Pulling herself up Stevie limped over to the doll snatching it up and carried it to a hall closet where she placed it onto a top shelf closing the door.

Stevie began her day by having a quick breakfast and tended to her injuries. As she nursed a cup of coffee, she called a friend of hers who was an expert in haunted and possessed objects. Maybe  he would have answers to her questions. Picking up her phone she called Eris an expert in haunted objects. He had always warned her not to pick up anything old or if it ever gave her a bad feeling.

She told him that her aunt Anica gave her this **doll** when she arrived in town. That she seemed hesitant about making her accept it. Eris told her that without seeing it in person there would be no one he would know for sure. That she should still make precautions to protect herself. Stevie almost laughed at this until she remembered that the doll had tripped her making her fall down the stairs.

Stevie could have literally died last night. She agreed that she would and ended the call. Looking up from her phone that doll was there sitting upright in the living room. Dropping her coffee cup it shattered onto the hardwood floor. Stevie cursed as she moved around the mess to grab some paper towels to clean it up.

When she was done Stevie placed the doll back into the closet placing a chair under the knob.

Just to make sure the doll could not get out.

It wouldn’t be able to, right?

If nothing else maybe it would help her sleep better tonight. Stevie went through the rest of her day. Trying to put the doll out of her mind, and what happened last night. Though her limping and throbbing head was an annoying reminder that it had happened. Stevie wished that she hadn’t accepted that doll from her aunt in the first place.

Later that night she settled into bed. Her head had stopped hurting but the throbbing in her ankle was still there. Stevie probably should have gone to the clinic near the house, but she was stubborn. Plus, she didn’t think that “*a doll tripped me last night”* would be a good reason to be seen. If it got worse, she would go and say she was moving furniture because she had recently moved.

As Stevie drifted off to sleep that was when the nightmares began. In this nightmare she was being chased down a long corridor. Stevie was running and kept looking over her shoulder. Yet every time she tried to get a good look at what was behind her the lights would go out. The figure would be easily blended into the darkness surrounding them keeping their form a secret.

Stevie gasped awake her heart hammering against her chest. As she shifted into a sitting position, she saw it… there sitting on a foot stool across from her was the **doll**. Stevie slowly laid back down pulling the covers up over her head. She squeezed her eyes tightly pursing her lips together slowly the lump in her throat. *“Please go away…”* she thought to herself.

In the morning, she found herself inside one of the many cafés that littered a downtown plaza staring into her empty coffee cup. There were prominent dark circles under her eyes. Stevie honestly felt that her energy had been sapped from her. This had to do with the doll there was no doubt about it. She needed to contact her aunt.

That woman had pawned the doll off on her, so she had to know something about it. There was no way Stevie was going to let Anica run away from this. She gave her a call and set up a location to meet her. When her Anica saw her niece, she lowered her head in shame the smile disappearing from her face. “I think you know what I’m here to talk to you about auntie.” Stevie gave a sideways smile taking a seat across from her.

“M-my goodness Stevie…you look very tired are you no–“

“Cut the crap auntie…”

Ancia frowned and folded her hands in front of her. She began to tell her niece about where she found the doll. It was at an estate sale an old house had been bought by the bank since it had gone unclaimed for years. A lot of the stuff they took out was still in good condition. When Anica’s eyes fell on that doll, she absolutely had to have it.

When she first brought it home things were normal, but then things began to be miss placed. Including the doll itself and it wasn’t always where Anica had left it. Then she began to have strange **accidents** happen in the house. Like falling down the stairs, almost stepping on broken glass and being electrocuted. Anica thought that she may have been hexed until the night she saw the doll scurry across the floor.

That was when she started losing sleep herself, and soon after the nightmares. So, Anica packed up the doll and put it into the undercroft of the stairs. When she got wind that Stevie was going to be moving into the same town Anica knew what she had to do. Her aunt’s eyes teared up as she placed a hand onto her niece’s hand who pulled it away. “Who was running the estate sale where you got the doll?” Stevie cleared her throat holding back a sob.

 

Anica dug through her purse and precured a card placing it onto the table. Stevie stood taking it and went on her way. Her aunt Ancia had pawned the doll off on her to save her own skin. That way she wouldn’t have sleepless nights, nightmares, or accidents. Instead, she would rather it happen to someone else.

Even if it meant that it was someone close to her…

Stevie arrived at the address on the business card. An older man was setting things out on display for the estate sale for the day. Their eyes met and he gave her a friendly smile and a wave. She took out her cellphone showing him a picture of the doll asking if he had seen this doll before. His smile faltered into a frown “Where did you get that doll?” he seemed uneasy and wiped his hands on his pants.

“My aunt bought it here” Stevie motioned to the building.

The man shook his head “It wasn’t supposed to be sold.”  he pointed at the picture.

“That **doll** is cursed…”

According to this owner of the estate sale a medium was supposed to pick the doll up. That he told his workers not to sell it, and some how it ended up on display with the rest of the dolls.

“If you have it…” he paused clearing his throat.

“Give it to the medium and get yourself cleansed.”

She paled putting her phone away wondering what kind of curse it was that was inhabiting the doll, but that was a question she would have to ask the medium their self. Stevie thanked him for the information and headed home to get the doll. She was glad to be getting rid of it. When she entered her home however the air felt stifling even with the AC on. The walls themselves creaked as she walked inside seeming to pull in towards her.

“Where the hell are you…” Stevie whispered aloud to herself looking around for the doll.

Her bedroom door creaked open from upstairs, and whispers flowed down into the living room. She knew it was trying lure her up there and that her problem wouldn’t go away until she got this doll out of her house. Grabbing the baseball bat she left downstairs from the night she fell Stevie headed upstairs a step at a time. Standing in the hallway she had full view of her bedroom. There on the bed was sitting the doll.

However, its appearance had changed…

Its clothing was darkened stained with something that Stevie could only assume was old blood.

The once pristine porcelain face was cracked and out of the cracks spewed a black swirling mist.

This thing was pure evil, and the bat she carried would not be enough to stop it.

Stevie leaned her bat against the wall and grabbed a pillowcase from the hall closet. Opening it up she pulled it down over the doll scooping it up and closed the end. Going down the stairs with it the doll thrashed about in the pillowcase in her hands. Just like her friend had told her Stevie needed to get this doll to a medium. She was out the door and in her car with the doll in a tied-up pillow sitting in the passenger seat.

Stevie found the closet medium and knocked in their door. The doll in her arms having gone still.

A woman opened the door giving her a once over before beckoning her inside. Stevie placed the doll where the medium told her do and she began her work. The doll was sealed inside a special type of wooden box and talismans were placed on the outside. When the medium approached Stevie again it was to put her through a series of steps in a cleansing ritual. She was told to leave the doll in her care, and she would see that it would be disposed of.

Stevie’s mind was at ease…at least for now.

One night as Stevie came in from doing a late-night snack run. She was gathering up her bags to head inside. When she had spotted something on her front steps. It was a wooden box with talismans placed all over it. All the seams were filled in with black wax.

Now the box was open…the lid laying off to the side.

Stevie knew that the doll was free, and she knew that it was hiding.

1ln6fq1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ln6fq1,Help me design around my olive green couch! Rug + coffee table ideas needed 🫠,"Hey everyone! Hoping for some design help with my living room. I’ll attach photos of the space, including my olive green/brown u-shaped sectional, current artwork, sideboard (under the TV), and my current coffee table — which I hate and am very happy to swap out. But I have no idea what to replace it with!

I’d love suggestions for:
	•	A rug that will work with the olive couch and help bring my style together - I love CA coastal, Mediterranean, hacienda, maybe even a touch southwestern vibes. The rugs I’ve been looking at are mostly flatweave but I can’t figure out a color or pattern than brightens the room and feels cool 
	•	A new coffee table (round or square, ideally 36–40 inches — marble? light wood? travertine? open to ideas!)
	•	Anything else you think would elevate the room — I’m open!

Style-wise, I want it to feel California coastal with maybe a touch of Southwestern influence. Think relaxed, earthy, vintage-y, with natural textures and a little bit of cowboy charm. I love warm neutrals, vintage art, and natural light.

The room gets great sunlight, has white walls, and decent floors — just trying to figure out what will pull it all together.

Thank you so much in advance! Can’t wait to hear your thoughts. Sorry for the random objects in the photos.

I have a type of synesthesia (the neurological crossing of sensory-wires, like hearing sounds/seeing colors, etc) known as *lexical-gustatory synesthesia.* This means when I read words, I can taste them. And I am a massive horror fan, so you can imagine this leads to situations. 

Anyway here’s how some of my fav books (and maybe yours!) taste:

WOOM by Duncan Ralston: left a weird powdery-latex taste in my mouth, like gloved fingers or a condom. Chalky and rubbery. 

Tender is the Flesh by Agustina Bazterrica: Oddly sweet and pungent, like overripe fruit. When something is very sweet but only because it’s rotten. 

House of Leaves by Mark Z Danielewski: Minty. Not sweet-minty, but menthol-minty. 

The Troop by Nick Cutter: Oranges. Or maybe clementines. Very very citrusy, so much that I could almost smell it too.

Piercing by Ryu Murakami (my personal favorite): Very bitter and astringent, like sour coffee. 

Penpal by Dathan Auerbach: Peanuts and peanut butter. It’s oddly specific but my yearly reread is like eating a peanut butter sandwich. 

Cows by Matthew Stokoe: I don’t wanna talk about it but if I had to give it a description, reading Cows tasted like the cheesy inside of an unwashed bellybutton. I will never read that book again. 

I’ve read (and tasted) more, but these are all I can think of off the top of my head. How does your favorite book taste? Maybe I’ve read it. I’m taking recommendations. :3",1,1751172458.0,horrorlit,2,0.67,False
1ln69at,https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/1ln69at/trip_report_washington_dc/,Trip Report: Washington DC,"Trip Report: Washington, DC



I took a long weekend solo trip to Washington DC - I went with a school group when I was in middle school and always wanted to go back. I also wanted this to be a bit of a warm-up/dry run for the solo trip to New York I have planned in September.



**Budget**: I didn’t have a defined budget, but I wanted to keep this trip on the cheaper side. I don’t think I accomplished that. I spent about $1000 total (including the pet sitter for my cat), about $500 of which went to the plane ticket and hostel stay.

Most of my spending could have been avoided - I took several ride shares that I could have avoided by planning ahead and being a bit braver about the Metro. I also DoorDashed food to my hostel because I was too tired to go out for dinner and too sore to grab something on-the-go. 

**Trip length**: 4 days (June 21-24)

**Accommodations**: I stayed at Generator Washington DC, which is a hostel. I was a  bit nervous about staying at a hostel, as I haven’t done that before. Having stayed there, I would stay at a hostel again, but I would not stay at this hostel. I was in a 4-woman dorm, and one of the women in my dorm was clearly not there for vacation - she had a constant hacking cough and was constantly on the phone talking about how she had been kicked out of her apartment or something - I felt bad that she was in a rough situation, but she was also not a good roommate. She was in and out of the bathroom all morning, and then when I was in there for MAYBE 15 minutes to quickly use the restroom, shower, and brush my teeth, she knocked on the door to ask if I was almost done - and then when I hurried out, assuming she urgently needed the bathroom, she didn’t even go in! She also didn’t wash her hands anytime she used the restroom, and then came out to our shared space…I could write a whole other essay about how much this lady bugged me but I will leave it at this.

The staff was very hit-or-miss. Some people were very friendly, others were downright rude. The A/C wasn’t able to keep up with the heatwave and I was on the 8th floor, so it was a bit steamy. I also was not overly impressed by the amenities. There was a nice pool space and rooftop lounge with plenty of seating, but the linens I was given had a hole in them and there were no hand towels in the restroom. There were also no means of making snacks or meals, such as a mini fridge or microwave. Lastly, and this was very small but annoying, the little net in the bunk meant to hold things like glasses, books, etc, had no elasticity so it barely held things. I think that I would have enjoyed my stay much more if the basics had been covered more thoughtfully. Also the whole place smelled damp and funky, like oatmeal.

**Activities**:

* I went for a walk around the neighborhood after getting settled at the hostel. I was a bit north of Dupont Circle, and the neighborhood was beautiful. Lots of architecture and style that you just don’t see much of where I’m from (the Midwest). I also found a cash-only bagel place that seemed to be somewhere locals go. I got breakfast there twice and it was very normal but it felt nice to do something not too touristy.
* I took a walking ghost tour in Georgetown. This was a fun way to kill a couple hours, and not too strenuous, but I can’t say I remember many of the specific ghost stories. We did stop at an intersection that used to be a Union checkpoint and learned about how women would smuggle documents and information in their elaborately styled hair - the ghosts supposedly search young womens’ hair as they cross the intersection. I was either too old or did not have fancy enough hair for the ghosts to search me. We also stopped at the house where the events that inspired The Exorcist took place, and we saw the infamous steps - those were genuinely creepy. Other than that, it was a slightly dressed-up sightseeing walk that I enjoyed.
* Smithsonian Natural History Museum: I ended up burning several hours here over the course of 2 days. I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back.
* Smithsonian National Zoo: This was a really good zoo, but I think after reconsidering how much time I had in the city, I could have switched this out for something else. I did get to see the giant pandas, which was cool. I had not seen them before. Otherwise, I went to the zoo in my city about a month ago and I could have spent this time on another museum or more time on the National Mall.
* Speaking of the Mall, I did spend some time walking around this on the way to the Smithsonian. I was supposed to spend some time here the day I arrived, but I was wiped out from traveling and took a quick nap in my room when I would have otherwise gone to the Mall. I wish I’d spent more dedicated time on it.

**Food**:

* Sunday evening dinner at La Tomate: I threw my dinner plans out the window and ended up walking to a little bistro in the same neighborhood as my hostel. I took my Kindle with me and ended up seated next to an older lady with a book, also having a solo dinner. We started chit-chatting, which is not usual for me, and we had a great conversation. She told me about her life in the US (she was moving back to her home country after 50 years) and we discussed hobbies, travel, and what to do in DC. It was one of her favorites and she wanted to have one last dinner here to say goodbye. She told me I seemed adventurous for traveling alone, which was one of the coolest compliments I’ve ever received. This was a really cool if temporary connection I never planned to make and I’m so happy it happened.
* Bagels, Etc: Cash-only bagel spot. The food is good and the people who work there are too busy to be too nice to you, which is different from the Midwest. Lots of people here gave off a local vibe, and I really enjoyed eating my to-go bacon egg and cheese on the way to the Smithsonian. Felt like a real city girl. Went here twice and would go again.
* Compass Coffee: my coffee was good but the vibe of this place was a little strange. The workers were very friendly and seemed to know the regulars, but there wasn’t a full menu posted anywhere and the fact that the menu only showed a small amount of options, plus very bright and colorful branding made it feel like I was in a coffee shop in a CW show. However, the coffee was really tasty, like I said. I would get coffee from here again if I went back to DC.

**Recs**:

* The Smithsonian Natural History Museum, La Tomate, and Bagels, Etc. There’s so much cool research and information available at the museum, and I actually found myself getting a little emotional a couple of times at the amount of information we have from people in the past. La Tomate and Bagels, Etc had good food and interesting atmospheres.
* This is a recommendation for future me: BUY BETTER SHOES. I underestimated how much walking I’d do (especially before I worked up the nerve to use the Metro) and my feet were destroyed, both due to blisters and lack of support. This majorly impacted how much I was able to do, and the trip would have been massively improved if I had taken better care of my poor little feet.
* Also for future me: use public transport. Don’t force yourself to walk everywhere. Where I’m from, public transport is not highly utilized and probably isn’t as streamlined and efficient as it is in major cities. I could have saved myself a lot of pain and a lot of money if I had researched the public transportation system ahead of time and used it from day one.



**Final Verdict**:

I loved how walkable DC was and there is so much to see - I would definitely go back. There are also a lot of food options and I’d like to try a few different places. I had a great time, learned a lot about solo travel, and improved my confidence. If you have a few days, plan ahead and definitely check it out!",2,1751172366.0,solotravel,0,1.0,False

I (17F) and me friend (16F) are classmates ( let's call her Millie). I met her in my freshman year of high school ( 9th grade ). For a few months we were in the same friend group. There were 8 of us in that group (with 2 Millies in it)and I think it's pretty normal that some get along better with others, but as a group we got along really well. Until we had an argument 

The reason for that was how the other Millie was behaving. Whenever Millie did something wrong, she would apologize saying it's because of her period. By the 10th time this happened, we had enough and confronted her. For some reason, she took this as hate and after that the Millies left the group. And a week later, they asked one of the girls from our group to meet them at the front gate of the school to apologize. In the end, they started pulling her hair and punching her. So we kept ourselfes away from them

Fast forward to the begining of sophmore year (10th garde). I was feeling a bit lonely because one of our friends failed and has to repeat a year ( the other Millie as well). Everyone had a seatmate that they could talk to except for me. Around that time, the two Millies stopped talking and Millie's other friend ( let's call her Amy, who is also my classmate) was absent for two weeks, so we started talking again. She told me how she was innocent about the fight because she actually didn't hit that girl( i don't even wanna know how I believed her) and why she wasn't friends with the other Millie. Overtime, I became close with Amy too and us three would sometimes go out to coffee

The turning point came when I started talking to guys. She got really weird and would make a face whenever I would mention him ( she was also talking to someone and I thought it's not working out between them) , so I stopped mentioning him and didn't think much of it. But when I started talking to a guy again, something was not right. She always asked if they had Instagram and if they understand ____ (I'm Hungarian, but it's not the native language here) and to show a picture. Before I got together with my now ex, she saw that my bff sent me a picture. On the picture was one of her classmates whom she sits next to. It's like her eyes were shining and asked if that's him (my ex). When I told her no, the only thing she said was 'Awww'. When I got together with him, in the groupchat congratulated me, but in private asked if I was stupid. When he broke up with me, she wrote ""Aww poor you. At least all six of us are single again 😊"" 

I decided to face time Amy, because she was friends with her longer and told her what's been happening lately, how I feel... To my shock she told me that when she told Millie that she has a crush,Millie immediately started following him on Instagram and texting. And recently she has been canceling on plans, saying she can't go, but when the two of us still want to go she says that we can't, she's not allowing it.

When we had enough of it, Amy and Millie went to a café after school ( I wasn't feeling well that day,so I didn't go to school). Amy later told that Millie is sorry, she was jelaous because the two of us got close and she thought we will unfriend her and she will try to change.

It's been 3 weeks since then and I don't think she changed. Amy agrees with this too.

How should I unfriend her without causing a scene?

Edit: my ex broke up with me a week ago. That's when Millie wrote that text",1,1751172234.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He butchered our child before my eyes, making me finally grasp the depth of his loathing. Now, reborn into this life, I've decided to follow through with his wishes regarding Maya. ... ""Did you hear? The head of the Taylor family originally wanted Steven's secretary, and he gave Steven three days to deliver her. If not, the Morris family will face ruin. But since that secretary is Steven's muse, the wife has to take the fall."" ""Hugo Taylor, not yet fifty, is notorious for his insatiable desires and sinister whims. Once you step foot in the Taylor mansion, you might not make it out alive… It's like walking into the lion’s den."" ""Exactly. Steven clearly never cared about his wife; Maya was the one who got under his skin."" The door to my room was slightly ajar, and I could faintly hear the housekeeper and the cook conversing in the kitchen. Kelsey, packing my suitcase, sighed deeply. ""Madam, why not try pleading with Mr. Morris again? You've been married for seven years; surely he must care for you."" I shook my head in resignation. ""He won't agree."" Everyone around knew that the Taylor family head was ruthless and commanded immense power. Steven wanted to safeguard Maya and save his company from collapse. The simplest solution was to offer me up because I bore an uncanny resemblance to her. In the limited time available, he couldn't possibly find someone else who looked like her as much as I did. In my past life, when the Taylor family demand came, he immediately shielded the fearful Maya at the Morris residence, then approached me, claiming the tycoon specifically wanted me. Feigning sincerity, he promised that he'd stop at nothing to prevent my being sent to the Taylors. Simultaneously, he assured Maya he would use me as the scapegoat. I exposed their scheme publicly, flatly refusing to go, and Steven had no choice but to drop the idea. The day he sent Maya away, he vowed that if she returned safely, he'd divorce me and marry her. But the day after Maya returned, she took her own life. Steven quietly laid her to rest in the woods behind the house and never mentioned divorce again. I thought he still cared for me until the day I gave birth when he savagely cut our child apart with a paring knife. I watched in horror as my tiny newborn turned into a gruesome mess, realizing then that he had harbored his hatred only to avenge Maya. So, when Hugo Taylor's assistant came to demand someone, Steven offered me without hesitation. It seemed he, too, had been reborn and was intent on safeguarding Maya this time. ""Madam, Mr. Morris is back. He wants to see you."" I nodded calmly. ""I know. I'll go right away."" Seeing them cozied up in the living room confirmed what I suspected. Steven released her hand casually and sipped his coffee with a detached air. ""Aurora, Hugo expects you in two days. Start packing."" He lied, just as before, pretending that the man specifically wanted me, never admitting I was merely a stand-in for Maya. I met his gaze and let out a cold laugh. ""Really, he specifically wants me?"" Steven suddenly avoided my gaze, rubbing his forehead in irritation. ""I told you it's you. Don't doubt me; you're lucky the Taylor family head is interested. Be grateful."" I smirked sarcastically. ""Really? Should I share this lucky break with Maya?""



Chapter 2



One sentence was all it took to set Steven ablaze with anger. ""Hugo's problem is with you, so why involve Maya? She's done nothing wrong. Apologize to her right now!"" I didn't comply. Instead, I watched as Maya suddenly dropped to her knees with a sorrowful expression. ""Mr. Morris, please don't argue with your wife over me. I'm just a poor orphan, a simple secretary. It's no wonder she looks down on me."" ""If my leaving could solve the company's crisis, I'm willing to work tirelessly for Mr. Morris, even if it means risking my life."" Her knees barely brushed the floor before Steven, filled with concern, hurriedly helped her up. ""Maya, don't kneel because of her. You'll always hold a special place in my heart."" He looked at her with such genuine tenderness that it was almost palpable. ""I know you're ready to give everything for me, but now's not the time to act impulsively. Besides, it's Aurora that Hugo is after. I don't want you taking unnecessary risks."" With that, Steven turned to glare at me sharply. ""This is resolved. Whether you agree to it or not doesn't matter. Crossing paths with someone like Hugo Taylor will only bring consequences you can't handle."" ""If you're worried I'll leave you over this, don't fret. I'm not that kind of person. No one can replace you as Mrs. Morris."" I couldn't be bothered to reply. Instead, I reached into my bag and retrieved a document. Steven, worried I might cause more trouble, quickly moved to shield Maya. ""What are you planning now?"" I smirked. ""Just making room for your beloved Maya. Steven, let's get a divorce."" I tossed the divorce papers in front of him, and he didn't even glance at them. ""Aurora, what nonsense is this? I've told you, the role of Mrs. Morris is always yours."" ""I know you don't want to go, but for the company's sake, you have to. Surely you wouldn't want to watch my company go under because of your stubbornness?"" How utterly ridiculous. Clearly, I was the one wronged, yet I was being manipulated into a position of moral pressure. This was the man I had devoted seven years of my life to. He made it sound as if I wished for his company to fail. Steven still thought I was the same Aurora he once knew. In this life, I had long prepared for dealing with the Taylors. Seeing my silence, Steven's expression grew even darker. ""Aurora, I'll be straight with you. Maya is already pregnant with my child."" ""If you can resolve the company's crisis, I'll let you be the child's mother."" ""No way!"" I exclaimed, tapping the papers on the table for emphasis. ""I'm not interested in raising someone else's child, nor do I want to be a mother to any random stray.""



Chapter 3



""Aurora!"" No matter how much the person behind me shouted like a lunatic, I didn't look back as I headed upstairs. I started packing, leaving behind everything Steven Morris had given me. Kelsey Castro, standing by, wiped her tears away again. ""Are you really not going to try talking to Mr. Morris one more time?"" ""I just don't get it. When both of Mr. Morris's parents died in that accident and his company was teetering on the edge, you were the one who stood by him. You gave up your career to help him rebuild. After all those years of loyalty, how can he just drop you for a woman who came crawling back after getting dumped?"" ""Mr. Morris always said he wanted to spend forever with you. How did he get all wrapped up with that woman so quickly?"" I sighed heavily. ""Don't call me madam anymore. Once I walk out of this door, I'm gone for good."" Kelsey's tears fell like rain. ""But if you go to the Taylors, who knows what will happen…"" I hesitated for a moment. Even Kelsey thought I was truly walking into trouble this time. Just as I was about to reassure her, a splash of cold water hit my face. ""Oh, I'm sorry. I must've slipped..."" It was Maya Olson. She glanced at the empty cup in her hand, a smug smile on her lips. Her eyes roamed over my suitcase. ""Aurora, do you really need to pack so much? Chances are you won't need half of it. Besides, you're not the first woman to land at the Taylors'—he probably has a stockpile of women's stuff there..."" Kelsey was fuming. ""This is outrageous."" I patted Kelsey's shoulder to calm her down. Maya assumed I wouldn't dare confront her, and her eyes gleamed with even more defiance and arrogance. She looked me up and down. ""I've heard the heir of the Taylors is quite the player. People say those who visit often can't handle it and end up pretty messed up... Aurora, I wonder how many rounds you'd last."" ""Tsk, tsk. I just hope that when you come back, you won't be unrecognizable, carrying who knows what diseases, and Steven won't even spare a glance your way."" I shook the water from my hair and told Maya to leave my room. ""Whether I live or die is none of your business. Just mind your own affairs."" She didn't budge, so I prepared to push her out. However, she suddenly grabbed my arm. ""Aurora, what do you think would happen if I fell from here? What would Steven do?"" She smiled maliciously and then released my hand. ""Ah, help..."" Just then, Steven Morris came by and caught her. ""Maya, are you okay?"" Maya leaned pitifully into Steven's embrace. ""I'm not that fragile, Mr. Morris. Please don't blame Aurora. She's just upset because I'm having your child and she can't handle it."" Her words made Steven's gaze burn with anger. He stormed up to me and slapped me hard across the face repeatedly. ""Aurora, I can't believe you! You won't even spare a child."" ""Even after everything she's done for you, pleading on your behalf, you're such a vicious woman."" ""You deserve every bit of this. You should just end up on some man's bed and never come back."" The venom in Steven's words was unmistakable, and he ordered me to be locked away in the dark basement. ""Without my permission, nobody goes in."" Kelsey fell to her knees, crying and pleading for me. ""Mr. Morris, you can't be so heartless. Have you forgotten? She's claustrophobic, she's terrified of the dark."" Steven remained indifferent. Maya, relishing the scene, taunted Kelsey. ""Kelsey, you're Mr. Morris's employee. Why do you always side with her?"" ""What did she offer you to make you so loyal, treating her like your own daughter?"" Kelsey couldn't hold back anymore. She lunged forward to scratch Maya's face but was shoved to the ground by Steven. Seeing things had gone too far, Kelsey feared for my safety and stayed by the basement door all night. Early the next morning, Reya Bell came to get me. Only then did Steven unlock the door. The faint light from outside fell on my curled-up body in the corner of the room. At that moment, I was parched and starving, fragile as paper, ready to tear at the slightest touch. Barely clinging to the remnants of life. Steven's gaze fell on my face, his pupils trembling slightly. ""Aurora!""



Chapter 4



He stepped forward quickly, reaching out as if to touch my face but hesitated, as if afraid I'd break at a mere touch. ""How could this happen? I... I only wanted to give you a small punishment."" Suddenly, it dawned on him. He recalled that Kelsey had mentioned my fear of confined spaces. Three years ago, amid a fierce battle for a prime piece of real estate, Steven's rival company had kidnapped me, locking me in a pitch-black cellar for three days and nights. Since then, I've been tormented by the fear of dark places. This was all because of Steven Morris. Yet here he was, using the same tactic to punish me. ""Aurora, I..."" Steven looked so distraught that he seemed on the brink of tears. Just as he was about to lift me up, Maya entered. ""How odd, the security footage showed everything was fine all night. How did it end up like this?"" Steven's hand paused mid-air. He glanced back at Maya, then studied me intently. His gaze shifted from sympathy to cold indifference. He straightened his suit collar and regarded me suspiciously. ""Is this all just a performance?"" Maya stared at me, stunned. ""Oh, so it really is an act? No wonder you were once an actress; you almost had me fooled."" She cast me a cryptic look before sliding her gaze to Steven, noting his displeasure with growing interest. ""Mr. Morris, Aurora didn’t mean any harm. She was just hoping for a little sympathy. That's why she used this small trick."" Steven's expression shifted several times until all traces of pity vanished. He sighed and called out to the people outside the door. ""Come in, take Aurora out. Hugo's car is waiting."" Two bodyguards entered and lifted me up. I was too weak to resist, so I let them carry me away. Reya and another bodyguard were already waiting outside. Seeing me being dragged out, my face pale, they rushed forward in concern, respectfully taking over from the two men. ""Miss Dixon, are you alright?"" I nodded, but just as I was about to get into the car, Maya suddenly grabbed my arm, leaning in close to whisper in my ear. ""Actually, Hugo wanted me, not you. You're just the scapegoat."" Her face lit up with a malicious smile. ""Thank you for taking my place. If you hadn't made it out, I'd make sure you had a grand farewell. As for Steven, I'll love him for both of us."" With that, Maya handed me a document. ""He never intended to divorce you. It was only because I threw a fit last night, demanding a title, that he signed it. This proves he truly cares for me."" Maya looked at my face and shook her head. ""What a waste of such a pretty face. You can only blame yourself for not being able to hold onto a man."" Looking at the divorce agreement, a smile spread across my lips. I didn’t find Maya so hateful anymore; I felt grateful to her. ""Thanks!"" As the luxury car pulled away, leaving the two of them behind, I smiled slightly. The real show was just beginning.",1,1751172095.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1ln65sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ln65sn/i_watched_something_on_my_laptop_that_nearly_took/,"I watched something on my laptop that nearly took my life. Be careful, you might find it online too.","The demonic nun Valak was just about to reveal itself in the painting when I hit pause on my laptop. Not because I was scared—hell no—but because nature was calling, and it was calling loud. I’d been putting off this bathroom break for the last twenty minutes of The Conjuring 2, telling myself I could hold it until the credits rolled. Bad decision. Now I was practically dancing in my desk chair, my bladder about ready to burst like a water balloon.



My apartment was a typical two-story rental in suburban Ohio—nothing fancy, but it had character. The kind of character that included a bathroom on the first floor and my computer setup on the second. I bounded down the creaky wooden stairs two at a time, nearly tripping over my cat Buster, who had the annoying habit of sleeping right in the middle of the stairway. 


“Move it, you furry roadblock,” I muttered, stepping around his orange tabby form. The downstairs bathroom was small and cramped, with outdated blue tile that probably hadn’t been changed since the Carter administration. But right now, it looked like paradise. I flicked on the light switch and got down to business, letting out a sigh of relief that would’ve made my high school football coach proud.


That’s when everything went dark. “Oh, come on!” I groaned into the sudden blackness. “Not again!” This neighborhood had a power grid about as reliable as a politician’s promise. The electricity went out at least twice a month, usually during storms, but sometimes just because the universe had a twisted sense of humor. That’s why I’d invested in an uninterruptible power supply for my computer setup just two days ago. Best one hundred fifty dollars I’d ever spent, or so I thought.


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The urgent alarm from my UPS echoed down from upstairs, cutting through the silence like a fire drill. I knew that sound—it meant I had maybe sixty seconds before my computer would shut down automatically. Sixty seconds to save my work, close my programs, and prevent any potential hard drive corruption. I yanked up my jeans, not bothering to button them properly, and stumbled through the pitch-black living room. My shin connected hard with the coffee table. “Son of a—!” I bit back the curse and kept moving, feeling my way toward the stairs with my hands outstretched like some kind of zombie.


The beeping was getting faster now, more insistent. Thirty seconds, maybe less. I took the stairs three at a time, my heart pounding not from fear but from the adrenaline rush of racing against time. My computer represented three years of college papers, family photos, music collection, and about a dozen half-finished short stories I kept telling myself I’d eventually submit somewhere.


The glow from my laptop screen was the only light source in the entire house now, casting eerie shadows on the walls of my bedroom. I dove for my desk chair and grabbed the mouse, ready to execute the fastest shutdown in computing history. But the screen had changed. The Conjuring 2 wasn’t paused anymore. The video player was closed completely, and instead, my desktop wallpaper—a picture of the Chicago skyline—stared back at me. I frowned, my finger hovering over the power button. “What the hell?”


A cool breeze brushed against the back of my neck, which was weird because I kept my windows closed in October. Ohio nights were getting chilly, and I wasn’t about to pay extra on my heating bill. Then I felt it—something soft and silky dragging across my scalp. Long strands of hair, moving with a will of their own. My blood turned to ice water.


BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! The UPS was practically screaming now, but I couldn’t move. Every horror movie cliché in the book was playing out in real time, and I was the idiot protagonist who’d ignored all the warning signs. Slowly, as if I was underwater, I turned around in my chair. “Jesus Christ, Emma!” I gasped, my hand flying to my chest. “You scared the hell out of me!” My girlfriend stood behind me in the doorway, her long brown hair catching what little light emanated from the laptop screen. She was wearing her favorite oversized sweater and those ridiculous fuzzy slippers I’d bought her for her birthday.


“Sorry, babe,” Emma said with a sheepish smile. “I used my key. I called out when I came in, but I guess you didn’t hear me with the movie going.” The UPS fell silent. The laptop screen went black. “Damn it!” I slammed my palm on the desk. “My poor hard drive. I had time to shut it down properly, but you scared me right when—” “Hey, don’t blame me for your bathroom emergency,” Emma laughed, moving closer and wrapping her arms around my shoulders from behind.


“Besides, I did you a favor closing that creepy movie. I came up here and saw it paused on that freaky tall figure spinning with that toy thing. Who watches that stuff alone at night?” Her hair fell forward, tickling my cheek. Even in the darkness, I could smell her shampoo—that vanilla and coconut blend she’d been using since we started dating six months ago. “I wasn’t scared,” I protested, leaning back into her embrace. “I’m a grown man. It takes more than some B-movie ghost girl to rattle me.” “Uh-huh. That’s why you were watching it with all the lights on, right?” “Strategic lighting,” I said with mock dignity. “Creates better contrast for optimal viewing experience.” Emma giggled, the sound warm and familiar in the cold darkness. “You’re such a dork. I love it.”


I was about to kiss her when something nagged at the back of my mind. A detail that didn’t fit. “Wait,” I said slowly. “When did you get here? I mean, exactly when?” “About ten minutes ago. Why?” “But I’ve been downstairs for maybe three minutes, tops. The power just went out.” “The power’s been out since I got here. I had to feel my way upstairs. Good thing you left your laptop running—it was the only light in the house.”


The room felt suddenly colder. I tried to process what she was saying, but it didn’t make sense. The timeline was all wrong. “Emma,” I said carefully, “how did you close the movie if the power was already out? The laptop would have been running on battery, but the screen would have gone into power save mode after a few minutes of inactivity.” Her arms loosened around my shoulders slightly. “I… I must have bumped the mouse when I came in. You know how sensitive that thing is.” That was true. My wireless mouse was notorious for its hair-trigger response. Still, something felt off. “You said you saw the movie paused on the tall figure with the toy thing?” “Yeah, super creepy. You had it stopped right at the worst part.” I turned in my chair to face her, though I could barely make out her silhouette in the darkness.


“Emma, that doesn’t make sense. I was watching the scene where the nun, Valak, was about to show up in the painting. The tall figure with the spinning toy—that’s the Crooked Man, and it comes way later in the movie.” My phone buzzed with a text message, the screen lighting up briefly on my nightstand. In that split second of illumination, I saw Emma clearly. And I saw her reflection in the bedroom mirror behind her. Emma had gotten her hair cut short yesterday. A cute pixie cut that made her look like Anne Hathaway. She’d been so excited about it, taking selfies and asking how it looked from every angle. The person standing behind me had long, dark hair cascading past her shoulders.


The phone screen went dark again. “Everything okay?” The voice was still Emma’s, still warm and familiar. “You’re being weird. What’s wrong?” I couldn’t move. Couldn’t speak. My rational mind was scrambling for explanations—maybe she was wearing a wig as a joke, maybe the brief light had played tricks on my eyes, maybe I was remembering wrong about the haircut. But deep down, in that primitive part of the brain that had kept humans alive for thousands of years, I knew. This wasn’t Emma. “You’re so tense,” the thing that looked like Emma whispered, her fingers—were they too cold?—massaging my shoulders. “Just relax. I closed that scary movie for you. Isn’t that better?”


The hair was touching my face again, and I could swear it was damp. Not with shampoo or styling product, but with something else. Something that smelled like stagnant water and old television static. “Emma,” I croaked, my voice barely audible. “Where’s your car?” “My car?” “I didn’t hear you pull into the driveway. I always hear your car—that muffler’s been acting up for weeks.” Silence. The hands on my shoulders were definitely too cold now. And too wet. “I parked on the street,” she said finally. “Didn’t want to wake the neighbors.” That was reasonable. Mrs. Henderson next door had complained about noise before. But Emma never parked on the street—she was paranoid about her car getting broken into or hit by drunk drivers.


My phone buzzed again. This time I lunged for it, desperate for light, for some connection to reality. The text was from Emma. “Hey babe! Running late for girls’ night. Movie probably won’t be over until midnight. Love you! ❤️” The timestamp showed 9:47 PM. It was now 10:23 PM. Emma was across town at the Century 16 theater watching some romantic comedy with her college friends. She’d told me about it three days ago. The hands on my shoulders tightened, nails digging into my skin through my t-shirt. “Put the phone down.”


The voice was still Emma’s, but there was something underneath it now. Something wet and static-filled, like a radio transmission from underwater. I couldn’t put the phone down. The screen was my lifeline, the only thing keeping me tethered to sanity. In its glow, I could see my reflection in the computer monitor in front of me. I was sitting in my chair. Something was standing behind me. But the reflection showed I was alone. “This isn’t real,” I whispered, more to myself than to whatever was behind me. “This is just… it’s the power outage, and the movie, and my imagination. Stress hallucination. That’s a thing, right?” The laughter that came from behind me wasn’t Emma’s. It was the sound of water gurgling in a clogged drain, of television static at 3 AM, of something that had been dead for a very long time.


“You watched my movie,” it said, and now I could hear the dual voices clearly—Emma’s sweet alto layered with something ancient and malevolent. “You stopped it right before the best part. That’s not very polite.” The bedroom door slammed shut behind us. I dropped my phone. The screen cracked when it hit the hardwood floor, but it still gave off just enough light to see by. “The Crooked Man is coming,” the thing whispered, and I could feel its breath on my ear—cold and damp like morning fog. 

“He’s coming for you.” “But I didn’t watch the whole thing!” I protested, my voice cracking like a thirteen-year-old’s. “I paused it! I didn’t even see the end!” “You don’t have to see the end.” The voice was fading, becoming more static than words. “You just have to believe.” “Believe in what?” “That some doors, once opened, can never be closed.” The weight behind me vanished. The cold presence disappeared like smoke.


I sat alone in my bedroom, in the dark, with a cracked phone and a dead laptop and the lingering smell of stagnant water. My hands were shaking as I picked up my phone and dialed Emma’s number. It went straight to voicemail—she always turned it off during movies.

 “It’s me,” I said after the beep, trying to keep my voice steady. “Call me back as soon as you get this. I don’t care how late it is. Just… call me back, okay? I love you.” I hung up and sat in the darkness, listening to the old house settle around me. Every creak sounded like footsteps. Every whisper of wind through the walls sounded like children’s nursery rhymes. 

The Crooked Man. I’d seen the movie. I knew how this worked. He fed on fear, appeared in reflections, twisted reality until you couldn’t tell what was real anymore. The Warrens had barely been able to stop him in the film.


But as I sat there, waiting for the power to come back on, waiting for Emma to call me back, waiting for my heart rate to return to normal, I realized something that made my blood run even colder. I’d never actually put the DVD in my laptop. I’d been streaming The Conjuring 2 from Max. Which meant that somewhere, somehow, he’d already found a way through. The power flickered back on at 11:47 PM. My laptop rebooted automatically, and the familiar Windows startup sound filled the room. Everything appeared normal—my desktop wallpaper, my icons, my files all exactly where I’d left them. 


But when I opened my browser to check my Max history, there was no record of me watching The Conjuring 2 that night.
Instead, there was a single entry I didn’t recognize: “THE CONJURING 2 - DIRECTOR’S NIGHTMARE CUT” Watched: October 23rd, 10:47 PM Duration: 7 minutes, 23 seconds Status: Incomplete Below that, in red text that seemed to pulse with its own light: “VIEWER CONTRACT ACTIVATED” “HE KNOWS YOU’RE WATCHING” “THANK YOU FOR PLAYING” I slammed the laptop shut and didn’t open it again for three days. But it didn’t matter. He was already inside.


Day 3
The mirrors started showing him first. Just glimpses at the edge of my vision—impossibly tall, unnaturally bent, that awful crooked smile. I covered every reflective surface in my apartment with towels and sheets, but it didn’t help. He was in the chrome faucets, the surface of my coffee, even the black screen of my powered-off phone. Emma came over on day 2, worried because I hadn’t been answering her calls. She looked exactly like she had that night—short pixie cut, concerned brown eyes, the same vanilla and coconut scent.


“You look terrible,” she said, touching my forehead. “When’s the last time you slept? Or showered? Or ate something that wasn’t energy bars and coffee?” I wanted to tell her everything. About the movie, about the thing pretending to be her, about the nursery rhyme that was stuck in my head like a broken record. But how do you explain something like that without sounding insane?


 “Just a rough week at work,” I lied. “Big project deadline.” She stayed with me that night, curled up against my side in bed, her breathing soft and even. I didn’t sleep. I couldn’t risk closing my eyes, couldn’t risk letting my guard down. At 3:33 AM, her phone buzzed with a text message. “There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile…” The message was from Emma’s own number.


I shook her awake. “Emma, who has access to your phone?” “What?” She sat up, groggy and confused. “Nobody. Why?” I showed her the message. She stared at it for a long moment, then looked at me with an expression I’d never seen before—part concern, part fear. “I didn’t send this.” “I know you didn’t.” “Then who—” She stopped mid-sentence, her eyes widening. “Oh my God, look at the screen.” The message was gone. In its place was a single word, repeated over and over until it filled the entire screen: CROOKED CROOKED CROOKED CROOKED CROOKED… Emma threw the phone across the room like it was on fire.


“What the hell is happening?” she whispered. I pulled her close, breathing in her scent, memorizing the feel of her in my arms. “I’m not sure you’d believe me if I told you.” But I told her anyway. Everything. The movie, the power outage, the thing that had pretended to be her, the seven-day countdown that was now down to hours. When I finished, she was quiet for a long time. “So,” she said finally, “you think this demon thing is going to come out of a screen and kill you?” “It sounds crazy when you say it like that.” “It sounds crazy any way you say it.” She sat up and looked at me seriously. “But I believe you.” “You do?” “You’re the most rational person I know. You don’t believe in ghosts or demons or any of that stuff. If you’re this scared, something real is happening.”


She paused, chewing her lower lip the way she did when she was thinking hard. “Besides,” she added, “my phone just sent me a text message from my own number. That’s not exactly normal.” We spent the rest of the night researching. Emma made coffee while I searched every corner of the internet for information about The Crooked Man, demonic manifestations, and ways to break supernatural curses. Most of it was garbage—forum posts by teenagers trying to scare each other, creepypasta stories that were obviously fiction, conspiracy theories about government mind control experiments.


 But buried in an obscure paranormal research blog, I found something that made my heart skip:
“Demonic entities that manifest through media feed on fear and recognition. Each viewing strengthens their connection to our reality. The Crooked Man, in particular, exists in the spaces between dimensions—he uses nursery rhymes and children’s games as anchors to our world. The only way to sever the connection is to complete the ritual that binds him, not run from it.” “What does that even mean?”


 Emma asked, reading over my shoulder. I stared at the screen, pieces clicking together in my mind. “The movie I watched—it wasn’t just a streaming copy of The Conjuring 2. It was something else. Something that used the movie as a… a doorway.” “A doorway to what?” “To here. To our world.” I turned to face her. “Emma, what if The Crooked Man isn’t just a movie monster? What if someone actually summoned him, filmed it, and now it’s spreading through streaming platforms like a virus?” “That’s…” She started to dismiss the idea, then stopped. “Actually, that’s terrifying.”


10:30 PM. An hour and a half until midnight. Every screen in my apartment was covered or unplugged, but I could feel his presence growing stronger. The temperature had dropped at least ten degrees, and there was that smell again—old wood and something sickly sweet, like rotting flowers. Emma held my hand as we sat on my couch, as far from any reflective surface as we could manage. “Maybe he won’t come,” Emma whispered. “Maybe covering the screens worked.” “Maybe.” But I knew she was wrong. I could feel him watching us, waiting. He didn’t need a screen anymore. He was already here, in the spaces between seconds, in the pause between heartbeats.


11:58 PM. The power went out. In the darkness, I heard the familiar sound of my laptop booting up, even though I’d unplugged it hours ago. The screen cast an eerie blue glow across the room. Words appeared, typing themselves letter by letter in a child’s handwriting: There was a crooked man, and he walked a crooked mile He found a crooked sixpence upon a crooked stile He bought a crooked cat, which caught a crooked mouse And they all lived together in a little crooked house Emma’s grip on my hand tightened.

 “Don’t look at it,” she whispered. “Don’t give it what it wants.” But I had to look. I had to see. The screen flickered, and there he was—impossibly tall, bent at unnatural angles, wearing Emma’s face but wrong, all wrong. His smile was too wide, his eyes too dark.


You stopped my game, appeared on screen in that same childish scrawl. Very rude. But I’m not unreasonable. I’ll make you a deal. “Don’t listen to it,” Emma said, but her voice sounded far away. Give me what I want, and I’ll leave you alone. All I want is to finish my nursery rhyme. Let me tell it through you. The room was getting colder. Frost was forming on the windows. Just say yes. Say yes, and all of this ends. You can go back to your normal life. You can keep your Emma. All you have to do is let me in. The cursor blinked, waiting for my response.


Emma was saying something, but her words were distorted, like she was speaking underwater. The only clear thing in the room was the screen and the thing looking out at me from inside it. I know you want to say yes, he typed. I can feel it. You’re tired of being afraid. You’re tired of fighting something you can’t understand.

 Just let go. Let me in. Let me— “NO!” Emma’s voice cut through the static in my head like a knife. She lunged forward and slammed my laptop shut, her hands burning from the cold radiating off the screen. The room plunged back into darkness. She shook me by the shoulders. “Look at me!” I blinked, focusing on her face in the dim light coming through the window. Her real face, warm and alive and completely, utterly human.


“He was in my head,” I whispered. “I almost… I almost said yes.” “But you didn’t.” Emma pulled me into a fierce hug. “You didn’t, and that’s what matters.” The clock on my wall chimed midnight. Nothing happened. We waited in the darkness for another hour, but the presence was gone. The cold lifted. The smell of rotting flowers faded away. When the power came back on at 1:23 AM, my laptop wouldn’t boot. The hard drive was completely fried—not corrupted, but physically destroyed, as if something had burned it out from the inside. We never did figure out what had really happened that week. 

The official explanation was that I’d had a stress-induced breakdown triggered by a power outage and too many horror movies. Emma went along with it, even though she’d experienced some of it herself.


But sometimes, late at night when I’m browsing the internet, I’ll come across a forum post or a social media comment that makes my blood run cold: “Has anyone else seen that weird version of The Conjuring 2 that’s been going around? It’s not the regular movie—it’s like a director’s cut or something. Really messed up. I watched it last week and I swear I keep hearing nursery rhymes…” “My friend sent me this link to a streaming site with a bunch of rare horror movies. There’s one called ‘The Conjuring 2 - Director’s Nightmare Cut’ that you can’t find anywhere else. 


The Crooked Man scenes are way more intense…” “Day 3. I know it sounds crazy, but I think he’s real. There was a crooked man and he walked a crooked mile… I can’t get it out of my head. If anyone else has seen the video, please tell me there’s a way to—” Those posts never get finished. 


And sometimes, just sometimes, I’ll notice that the user who started the thread joined the forum exactly seven days ago. I’ve stopped clicking on those links. Some doors, once opened, can never really be closed. But they can be walked away from. And sometimes, that’s enough.

No one prepared me for this. I was raised to believe community was everything. I did everything since I moved out to develop relationships with people who felt the same. My family who taught me this are the biggest hypocrites. None of them reach out. 

I even started a garden in hopes of taking care of and feeding my friends when shit hits the fan. Started doubling down on collecting canned goods and even got chickens. Gave three families eggs when egg prices went up. 

Now that I’m single and living alone, my friends forget about me if I don’t reach out. I used to have dozens of people over at a time. I lost many of those people when my ex fiancé and I split, but the ones who’ve stayed quietly dispersed. 

And when we are together, they’re occupied with their own relationships/phones/families and the third wheel feeling starts to set in. 

I missed hosting people. I missed having my friends around. No one comes over anymore and it makes cleaning the house feel useless. 

Sometimes when I get ready to do anything, I just look around and think about how long it’ll be until anyone sees it done. And how I embellished my home originally with the prospect of guests to appreciate it all with. 

I collected stupid coffee table books, fancy dinner wear and board games. Now it just collects dust.

The longer I’m single, the more time I spend alone, the more stuff I want to get rid of. 

I used to collect trinkets when I was with my ex in hopes of passing them down to future family, or using them in some projects. Some has been sitting in a box for the past year I been alone. As much as I want to put it out, just feels like a useless chore.

I’m going to be having a garage sale soon to purge.

1ln5zdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1ln5zdm/dolores_claiborne_by_stephen_king/,Dolores Claiborne by Stephen King:," In the northwestern part of Maine--in the area known as the Lakes District--the small town of Sharbot curves like a crescent around a beautiful body of water called Dark Score Lake. Dark Score is one of the deepest lakes in New England--better than three hundred feet in some places. Some of the locals have been known to claim it is bottomless ... but usually only after a few beers (in Sharbot, half a dozen is considered a few).  
  
  If one were to draw a straight line across a map of the state from northwest to southeast, beginning at the tiny cartographic point which represents Sharbot and continuing through the larger dot that marks the city of Bangor, one would eventually come to the smallest dot of all--a tiny green grain standing off in the Atlantic about sixteen miles from Bar Harbor. This small green grain is Little Tall Island, population 204 in the 1990 census, down from an all-time high of 527 in the census of 1960.  
  
  These two tiny communities, exactly one hundred and forty miles apart as the crow flies, bracket the island and coastal aspects of New England's largest state like a pair of nondescript book-ends. They have nothing whatever in common; one would be hard put, in fact, to find a citizen in either who had any knowledge of the other.  
  
  Yet in the summer of 1963, the last summer before America--and the whole world--would be changed forever by an assassin's bullet, Sharbot and Little Tall were linked by a remarkable celestial phenomenon: the last total eclipse visible in northern New England until the year 2016.  
  
  Both Sharbot, in far western Maine, and Little Tall Island, the state's easternmost spot, lay in the path of totality. And although over half the towns along the path of the eclipse were denied a view of the phenomenon by low-hanging clouds on that still, humid day, both Sharbot and Little Tall enjoyed perfect viewing conditions. For residents of Sharbot, the eclipse began at 4:29 P.M., EDT; for residents of Little Tall, it began at 4:34. The period of totality which raced across the state lasted almost exactly three minutes. In Sharbot, total darkness lasted from 5:39 until 5:41; on Little Tall, darkness was total from 5:42 until almost 5:43, a period of fifty-nine seconds, in fact.  
  
  As this strange darkness rolled its wave across the state, stars came out and filled the daytime sky; birds went to roost; bats circled aimlessly above chimneys; cows lay down in the fields where they had been cropping and went to sleep. The sun became a blazing fairy-ring in the sky, and as the world within that swatch of unnatural blackness lay suspended and hushed and the crickets began to sing, two people who would never meet sensed each other, turned toward each other as flowers turn to follow the heat of the sun.  
  
  One was a girl named Jessie Mahout--she was in Sharbot, at the western end of the state. The other was a mother of three named Dolores St. George--she was on Little Tall Island, at the eastern end of the state.  
  
  Both heard owls hoot in the daytime. Both lay in deep valleys of terror, nightmare geographies of which both believed they would never speak. Both felt the darkness was entirely fitting, and thanked God for it.  
  
  Jessie Mahout would marry a man named Gerald Burlingame, and her story is told in Gerald's Game. Dolores St. George would take back her birth name, Dolores Claiborne, and she tells her story in the pages that follow. Both are tales of women in the path of the eclipse, and of how they emerge from the darkness.  
  
  What did you ask, Andy Bissette? Do I ""understand these rights as you've explained em to me""?  
  
  Gorry! What makes some men so numb?  
  
  No, you never mind--still your jawin and listen to me for awhile. I got an idear you're gonna be listenin to me most of the night, so you might as well get used to it. Coss I understand what you read to me! Do I look like I lost all m'brains since I seen you down to the market? That was just Monday afternoon, in case you lost track. I told you your wife would give you merry hell about buying that day-old bread--penny wise and pound foolish, the old saying is--and I bet I was right, wasn't I?  
  
  I understand my rights just fine, Andy; my mother never raised no fools. I understand my responsibilities too, God help me.  
  
  Anything I say might be used against me in a court of law, you say? Well will wonders never cease! And you can just get that smirk off your face, Frank Proulx. You may be a hot-shot town cop these days, but it hasn't been too long since I seen you runnin around in a saggy diaper with that same foolish grin on your face. I'll give you a little piece of advice--when you get around an old biddy like me, you just want to save that grin. I c'n read you easier'n an underwear ad in the Sears catalogue.  
  
  All right, we've had our fun; might as well get down to it. I'm gonna tell you three a hell of a lot startin right about now, and a hell of a lot of it prob'ly could be used against me in a court of law, if anyone wanted to at this late date. The joke of it is, folks on the island know most of it already, and I'm just about half-past give-a-shit, as old Neely Robichaud used to say when he was in his cups. Which was most of the time, as anyone who knew him will tell you.  
  
  I do give a shit about one thing, though, and that's why I come down here on my own hook. I didn't kill that bitch Vera Donovan, and no matter what you think now, I intend to make you believe that. I didn't push her down that frigging staircase. It's fine if you want to lock me up for the other, but I don't have none of that bitch's blood on my hands. And I think you will believe that by the time I'm finished, Andy. You was always a good enough boy, as boys go--fair-minded, is what I mean--and you've turned into a decent man. Don't let it go to your head, though; you grew up same as any other man, with some woman to warsh your clothes and wipe your nose and turn you around when you got y'self pointed in the wrong direction.  
  
  One other thing before we get started--I know you, Andy, and Frank, accourse, but who's this woman with the tape-recorder?  
  
  Oh Christ, Andy, I know she's a stenographer! Didn't I just tell you my Mamma didn't raise any fools? I may be sixty-six come this November, but I still got all my marbles. I know a woman with a tape-recorder and a shorthand pad's a stenographer. I watch all those courtroom shows, even that L. A. Law where nobody can seem to keep their clothes on for fifteen minutes at a time.  
  
  What's your name, honey?  
  
  Uh-huh ... and whereabouts do you hail from?  
  
  Oh, quit it, Andy! What else you got to do tonight? Was you plannin to go over to the shingle and see if you could catch a few fellas diggin quahogs without a licence? That'd prob'ly be more excitement than your heart could take, wouldn't it? Ha!  
  
  There. That's better. You're Nancy Bannister from Kennebunk, and I'm Dolores Claiborne from right here on Little Tall Island. Now I already said I'm going to do a country-fair job of talking before we're done in here, and you're going to find I wasn't lyin a bit. So if you need me to speak up or to slow down, just say so. You needn't be shy with me. I want you to get every goddam word, startin with this: twenty-nine years ago, when Police Chief Bissette here was in the first grade and still eatin the paste off the back of his pitchers, I killed my husband, Joe St. George.  
  
  I feel a draft in here, Andy. Might go away if you shutcha goddam trap. I don't know what you're lookin so surprised about, anyway. You know I killed Joe. Everybody on Little Tall knows it, and probably half the people across the reach in Jonesport know it, too. It's just that nobody could prove it. And I wouldn't be here now, admittin it in front of Frank Proulx and Nancy Bannister from Kennebunk if it hadn't been for that stupid bitch Vera, gettin up to more of her nasty old tricks.  
  
  Well, she'll never get up to any more of em, will she? There's that for consolation, at least.  
  
  Shift that recorder a little closer to me, Nancy, dear--if this is going to get done, it'll get done right, I'll be bound. Don't those Japanese just make the most cunning little things? Yes indeed... but I guess we both know that what's going on the tape inside that little cutie-pie could put me in the Women's Correctional for the rest of my life. Still, I don't have no choice. I swear before heaven I always knew that Vera Donovan'd just about be the death of me--I knew it from the first time I saw her. And look what she's done--just lo  
ok what that goddamned old bitch has done to me. This time she's really stuck her gum in my gears. But that's rich people for you; if they can't kick you to death, they're apt to kiss you to death with kindness.  
  
  What?  
  
  Oh, gorry! I'm gettin to it, Andy, if you'll just give me a little peace! I'm just tryin to decide if I should tell it back to front or front to back. I don't s'pose I could have a little drink, could I?  
  
  Oh, frig ya coffee! Take the whole pot and shove it up your kazoo. Just gimme a glass of water if you're too cheap to part with a swallow of the Beam you keep in your desk drawer. I ain't--  
  
  What do you mean, how do I know that? Why, Andy Bissette, someone who didn't know better'd think you just toddled out of a Saltines box yesterday. Do you think me killin my husband is the only thing the folks on this island have got to talk about? Hell, that's old news. You, now--you still got some juice left in you.  
  
  Thank you, Frank. You was always a pretty good boy, too, although you was kinda hard to look at in church until your mother got you cured of the booger-hookin habit. Gorry, there were times when you had that finger so far up y'nose it was a wonder you didn't poke your brains out. And what the hell are you blushin for? Was never a kid alive who didn't mine a little green gold outta their old pump every now and again. At least you knew enough to keep your hands outta your pants and off your nuts, at least in church, and there's a lot of boys who never--  
  
  Yes, Andy, yes--I am gonna tell it. Jeezly-crow, you ain't never shook the ants out of your pants, have you?  
  
  Tell you what: I'm gonna compromise. Instead of telling her front to back or back to front, I'm gonna start in the middle and just kinda work both ways. And if you don't like it, Andy Bissette, you can write it up on your T.S. list and mail it to the chaplain.  
  
  Me and Joe had three kids, and when he died in the summer of '63, Selena was fifteen, Joe Junior was thirteen, and Little Pete was just nine. Well, Joe didn't leave me a pot to piss in and hardly a window to throw it out of--  
  
  I guess you'll have to fix this up some, Nancy, won't you? I'm just an old woman with a foul temper and a fouler mouth, but that's what happens, more often than not, when you've had a foul life.

Now, where was I? I ain't lost my place already, have I?  
  
  Oh--yes. Thank you, honeybunch.  
  
  What Joe left me with was that shacky little place out by the East Head and six acres of land, most of it blackberry tangles and the kind of trashwood that grows back after a clear-cut operation. What else? Lemme see. Three trucks that didn't run--two pickups and a pulp-hauler--four cord of wood, a bill at the grocery, a bill at the hardware, a bill with the oil company, a bill with the funeral home ... and do you want the icing on the goddam cake? He wa'ant a week in the ground before that rumpot Harry Doucette come over with a friggin IOU that said Joe owed him twenty dollars on a baseball bet!  
  
  He left me all that, but do you think he left me any goddam insurance money? Nossir! Although that might have been a blessin in disguise, the way things turned out. I guess I'll get to that part before I'm done, but all I'm trying to say now is that Joe St. George really wa'ant a man at all; he was a goddam millstone I wore around my neck. Worse, really, because a millstone don't get drunk and then come home smellin of beer and wantin to throw a fuck into you at one in the morning. Wasn't none of that the reason why I killed the sonofawhore, but I guess it's as good a place as any to start.  
  
  An island's not a good place to kill anybody, I can tell you that. Seems like there's always someone around, itching to get his nose into your business just when you can least afford it. That's why I did it when I did, and I'll get to that, too. For now suffice it to say that I did it just about three years after Vera Donovan's husband died in a motor accident outside of Baltimore, which was where they lived when they wasn't summerin on Little Tall. Back in those days, most of Vera's screws were still nice and tight.  
  
  With Joe out of the pitcher and no money coming in, I was in a fix, I can tell you--I got an idear there's no one in the whole world feels as desperate as a woman on her own with kids dependin on her. I'd 'bout decided I'd better cross the reach and see if I couldn't get a job in Jonesport, checkin out groceries at the Shop n Save or waitressin in a restaurant, when that numb pussy all of a sudden decided she was gonna live on the island all year round. Most everyone thought she'd blown a fuse, but I wasn't all that surprised--by then she was spendin a lot of time up here, anyway.  
  
  The fella who worked for her in those days--I don't remember his name, but you know who I mean, Andy, that dumb hunky that always wore his pants tight enough to show the world he had balls as big as Mason jars--called me up and said The Missus (that's what he always called her, The Missus; my, wasn't he dumb) wanted to know if I'd come to work for her full-time as her housekeeper. Well, I'd done it summers for the family since 1950, and I s'pose it was natural enough for her to call me before she called anyone else, but at the time it seemed like the answer to all my prayers.  
  
  I said yes right on the spot, and I worked for her right up until yest'y forenoon, when she went down the front stairs on her stupid empty head.  
  
  What was it her husband did, Andy? Made airplanes, didn't he?  
  
  Oh. Ayuh, I guess I did hear that, but you know how people on the island talk. All I know for sure is that they was well-fixed, mighty well-fixed, and she got it all when he died. Except for what the government took, accourse, and I doubt if it got anywhere near as much as it was probably owed. Michael Donovan was sharp as a tack. Sly, too. And although nobody would believe it from the way she was over the last ten years, Vera was as sly as he was ... and she had her sly days right up until she died. I wonder if she knew what kind of a jam she'd be leavin me in if she did anything besides die in bed of a nice quiet heart-attack? I been down by East Head most of the day, sittin on those rickety stairs and thinkin about that ... that and a few hundred other things. First I'd think no, a bowl of oatmeal has more brains than Vera Donovan had at the end, and then I'd remember how she was about the vacuum cleaner and I'd think maybe ... yes, maybe ...  
  
  But it don't matter now. The only thing that matters now is that I have flopped out of the frying pan and into the fire, and I'd dearly love to drag myself clear before my ass gets burned any worse. If I still can.  
  
  I started off as Vera Donovan's housekeeper, and I ended up bein something they call a ""paid companion."" It didn't take me too long to figure out the difference. As Vera's housekeeper, I had to eat shit eight hours a day, five days a week. As her paid companion, I had to eat it around the clock.  
  
  She had her first stroke in the summer of 1968, while she was watchin the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on her television. That was just a little one, and she used to blame it on Hubert Humphrey. ""I finally looked at that happy asshole one too many times,"" she said, ""and I popped a goddam blood-vessel. I should have known it was gonna happen, and it could just as easily have been Nixon.""  
  
  She had a bigger one in 1975, and that time she didn't have no politicians to blame it on. Dr. Freneau told her she better quit smokin and drinkin, but he could have saved his breath--no high-steppin kitty like Vera Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks Donovan was going to listen to a plain old country doctor like Chip Freneau. ""I'll bury him,"" she used to say, ""and have a Scotch and soda sitting on his headstone. ""  
  
  For awhile it seemed like maybe she would do just that--he kept scoldin her, and she kept sailin along like the Queen Mary. Then, in 1981, she had her first whopper, and the hunky got killed in a car-wreck over on the mainland the very next year. That was when I moved in with her--October of 1982.  
  
  Did I have to? I dunno. I guess not. I had my Sociable Security, as old Hattie McLeod used to call it. It wasn't much, but the kids were long gone by then--Litt!e Pete right off the face of the earth, poor little lost lamb--and I had managed to put a few dollars away, too. Living on the island has always been cheap, and while it ain't what it once was, it's still a whale of a lot cheaper than livin on the mainland. So I guess I didn't have to go live with Vera, no.  
  
  But by then her and me was used to each other. It's hard to explain to a man. I 'spect Nancy there with her pads n pens n tape-recorder understands, but I don't think she's s'posed to talk. We was used to each other in the way I s'pose two old bats can get used to hangin upside-down next to each other in the same cave, even though they're a long way from what you'd call the best of friends. And it wasn't really no big change. Hanging my Sunday clothes in the closet next to my housedresses was really the biggest part of it, because by the fall of '82 I was there all day every day and most nights as well. The money was a little better, but not so good I'd made the downpayment on my first Cadillac, if you know what I mean. Ha!  
  
  I guess I did it mostly because there wasn't nobody else. She had a business manager down in New York, a man named Greenbush, but Greenbush wa'ant going to come up to Little Tall so she could scream down at him from her bedroom window to be sure and hang those sheets with six pins, not four, nor was he gonna move into the guest-room and change her diapers and wipe the shit off her fat old can while she accused him of stealin the dimes out of her goddam china pig and told him how she was gonna see him in jail for it. Greenbush cut the checks; I cleaned up her shit and listened to her rave on about the sheets and the dust bunnies and her goddam china pig.  
  
  And what of it? I don't expect no medal for it, not even a Purple Heart. I've wiped up a lot of shit in my time, listened to even more of it (I was married to Joe St. George for sixteen years, remember), and none of it ever gave me the rickets. I guess in the end I stuck with her because she didn't have nobody else; it was either me or the nursin home. Her kids never came to see her, and that was one thing I felt sorry for her about. I didn't expect them to pitch in, don't get that idear, but I didn't see why they couldn't mend their old quarrel, whatever it was, and come once in awhile to spend the day or maybe a weekend with her. She was a miserable bitch, no doubt about it, but she was their Ma. And by then she was old. Accourse I know a lot more now than I did then, but--  
  
  What?  
  
  Yes, it's true. If I'm lyin, I'm dyin, as my grand-sons like to say. You just call that fella Greenbush, if you don't believe me. I expect when the news gets out--and it wi  
ll, it always does--there'll be one of those soppy articles in the Bangor Daily News about how wonderful it all is. Well, I got news for you--it ain't wonderful. A friggin nightmare is what it is. No matter what happens in here, folks are gonna say I brainwarshed her into doin what she done n then killed her. I know it, Andy, n so do you. There ain't no power in heaven or on earth that can stop people from thinkin the worst when they want to.  
  
  Well, not one goddam word of it's true. I didn't force her to do nothing, and she sure didn't do what she did because she loved me, or even liked me. I suppose she might have done it because she thought she owed me--in her own peculiar way she could have thought she owed me plenty, and t'wouldn't have been her way to say anything. Could even be what she done was her way of thankin me ... not for changin her shitty diapers but for bein there on all the nights when the wires came out of the corners or the dust bunnies came out from under the bed.  
  
  You don't understand that, I know, but you will. Before you open that door and walk out of this room, I promise you'll understand everything.  
  
  She had three ways of bein a bitch. I've known women who had more, but three's good for a senile old lady mostly stuck in a wheelchair or in bed. Three's damn good for a woman like that.  
  
  The first way was when she was a bitch because she couldn't help it. You remember what I said about the clothespins, how you had to use six of em to hang the sheets, never just four? Well, that was just one example.  
  
  There were certain ways things had to be done if you worked for Mrs. Kiss-My-Back-Cheeks Vera Donovan, and you didn't want to forget a single one of them. She told you how things were going to go right up front, and I'm here to tell you that's how things went. If you forgot something once, you got the rough side of her tongue. If you forgot twice, you got docked on payday. If you forgot three times, that was it--you were down the road, and no excuses listened to. That was Vera's rule, and it sat all right with me. I thought it was hard, but I thought it was fair. If you was told twice which racks she wanted the bakin put on after it came out of the oven, and not ever to stick it on the kitchen windowsills to cool like shanty Irish would do, and if you still couldn't remember, the chances were good you wasn't never going to remember.  
  
  Three strikes and you're out was the rule, there was absolutely no exceptions to it, and I worked with a lot of different people in that house over the years because of it. I heard it said more'n once in the old days that workin for the Donovans was like steppin into one of those revolvin doors. You might get one spin, or two, and some folks went around as many as ten times or a dozen, but you always got spat out onto the sidewalk in the end. So when I went to work for her in the first place--this was in 1949--I went like you'd go into a dragon's cave. But she wasn't as bad as people liked to make out. If you kept your ears open, you could stay. I did, and the hunky did, too. But you had to stay on your toes all the time, because she was sharp, because she always knew more of what was going on with the island folk than any of the other summer people did ... and because she could be mean. Even back then, before all her other troubles befell her, she could be mean. It was like a hobby with her.  
  
  ""What are you doing here?"" she says to me on that first day. ""Shouldn't you be home minding that new baby of yours and making nice big dinners for the light of your life?""  
  
  ""Mrs. Cullum's happy to watch Selena four hours a day,"" I said. ""Part-time is all I can take, ma'am.""  
  
  ""Part-time is all I need, as I believe my advertisement in the local excuse for a newspaper said,"" she comes right back--just showin me the edge of that sharp tongue of hers, not actually cuttin me with it like she would so many times later. She was knittin that day, as I remember. That woman could knit like a flash--a whole pair of socks in a single day was no problem for her, even if she started as late as ten o'clock. But she said she had to be in the mood.  
  
  ""Yessum,"" I said. ""It did.""  
  
  ""My name isn't Yessum,"" she said, putting her knitting down. ""It's Vera Donovan. If I hire you, you'll call me Missus Donovan--at least until we know each other well enough to make a change--and I'll call you Dolores. Is that clear?""  
  
  ""Yes, Missus Donovan,"" I said.  
  
  ""All right, we're off to a good start. Now answer my question. What are you doing here when you've got a house of your own to keep, Dolores?""  
  
  ""I want to earn a little extra money for Christmas,"" I said. I'd already decided on my way over I'd say that if she asked. ""And if I'm satisfactory until then--and if I like working for you, of course--maybe I'll stay on a little longer.""  
  
  ""If you like working for me,"" she repeats back, then rolls her eyes like it was the silliest thing she'd ever heard--how could anybody not like working for the great Vera Donovan? Then she repeats back, ""Christmas money."" She takes a pause, lookin at me the whole time, then says it again, even more sarcastic. ""Kuh-risss-mas money!""  
  
  Like she suspected I was really there because I barely had the rice shook out of my hair and was havin marriage troubles already, and she only wanted to see me blush and drop my eyes to know for sure. So I didn't blush and I didn't drop my eyes, although I was only twenty-two and it was a near thing. Nor would I have admitted to a single soul that I was already havin trouble--wild hosses wouldn't have dragged it out of me. Christmas money was good enough for Vera, no matter how sarcastic she might say it, and all I'd allow to myself was that the house-money was a little tight that summer. It was only years later that I could admit the real reason why I went up to face the dragon in her den that day: I had to find a way to put back some of the money Joe was drinking up through the week and losin in the Friday-night poker games at Fudgy's Tavern over on the mainland. In those days I still believed the love of a man for a woman and a woman for a man was stronger than the love of drinkin and hell-raisin--that love would eventually rise to the top like cream in a bottle of milk. I learned better over the next ten years. The world's a sorry schoolroom sometimes, ain't it?  
  
  ""Well,"" Vera said, ""we'll give each other a try, Dolores St. George ... although even if you work out, I imagine you'll be pregnant again in a year or so, and that's the last I'll see of you.""  
  
  The fact was I was two months pregnant right then, but wild hosses wouldn't have dragged that outta me, either. I wanted the ten dollars a week the job paid, and I got it, and you better believe me when I say I earned every red cent of it. I worked my tail off that summer, and when Labor Day rolled around, Vera ast me if I wanted to keep on after they went back to Baltimore--someone has to keep a big place like that up to snuff all the year round, you know--and I said fine.  
  
  I kep at it until a month before Joe Junior was born, and I was back at it even before he was off the titty. In the summer I left him with Arlene Cullum--Vera wouldn't have a crying baby in the house, not her--but when she and her husband were gone, I'd bring both him and Selena in with me. Selena could be mostly left alone--even at two going on three she could be trusted most of the time. Joe Junior I carted with me on my daily rounds. He took his first steps in the master bedroom, although you can believe Vera never heard of it.  
  
  She called me a week after I delivered (I almost didn't send her a birth announcement, then decided if she thought I was lookin for a fancy present that was her problem), congratulated me on givin birth to a son, and then said what I think she really called to say--that she was holdin my place for me. I think she intended me to be flattered, and I was. It was about the highest compliment a woman like Vera can pay, and it meant a lot more to me than the twenty-five-dollar bonus check I got in the mail from her in December of that year.  
  
  She was hard but she was fair, and around that house of hers she was always the boss. Her husband wasn't there but one day in ten anyway, even in the summers when they were supposed to be livin there full-time, but when he was, you still knew who was in charge. Maybe he had two or three hundred executives who dropped their drawers every time he said shit, but Vera was boss of the shootin match on Little Tall Island, and when she told him to take his shoes off and stop trackin dirt on her nice clean carpet, he minded.<  
br />  
  And like I say, she had her ways of doin things. Did she ever! I don't know where she got her idears, but I do know she was a prisoner of them. If things wasn't done a certain way, she'd get a headache or one in her gut. She spent so much of her day checkin up on things that I thought plenty of times she would have had more peace of mind if she'd just given over and kep that house herself.  
  
  All the tubs had to be scrubbed out with Spic n Span, that was one thing. No Lestoil, no Top Job, no Mr. Clean. Just Spic n Span. If she caught you scrubbin one of the tubs with anything else, God help you.  
  
  When it came to the ironin, you had to use a special spray-bottle of starch on the collars of the shirts and the blouses, and there was a piece of gauze you were supposed to put over the collar before you sprayed. Friggin gauze didn't do a goddam thing, so far as I could ever tell, and I must have ironed at least ten thousand shirts and blouses in that house, but if she came into the laundry room and saw you was doin shirts without that little piece of netting on a collar, or at least hung over the end of the ironin board, God help you.  
  
  If you didn't remember to turn on the exhaust fan in the kitchen when you were fryin somethin, God help you.  
  
  The garbage cans in the garage, that was another thing. There was six of em. Sonny Quist came once a week to pick up the swill, and either the housekeeper or one of the maids--whoever was most handy--was supposed to bring those cans back into the garage the minute, the very second, he was gone. And you couldn't just drag em into the corner and leave em; they had to be lined up two and two and two along the garage's east wall, with their covers turned upside-down on top of em. If you forgot to do it just that way, God help you.  
  
  Then there was the welcome mats. There were three of em--one for the front door, one for the patio door, and one for the back door, which had one of those snooty TRADESMAN'S ENTRANCE signs on it right up until last year, when I got tired of looking at it and took it down. Once a week I had to take those welcome mats and lay em on a big rock at the end of the back yard, oh, I'm gonna say about forty yards down from the swimmin pool, and beat the dirt out of em with a broom. Really had to make the dust fly. And if you lagged off, she was apt to catch you. She didn't watch every time you beat the welcome mats, but lots of times she would. She'd stand on the patio with a pair of her husband's binoculars. And the thing was, when you brought the mats back to the house, you had to make sure WELCOME was pointin the right way. The right way was so people walkin up to whichever door it was could read it. Put a welcome mat back on the stoop upside-down and God help you.

1ln5z5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ln5z5m/freeloader_or_expectations/,Freeloader or Expectations?,"I was seeing a woman for two months and it got to the stage where I felt she expected me to pay for our dates. Don’t get me wrong; she paid for coffees here and there, a few burrito bowls, and she let me stay at hers. Regardless; the emphasis was always on me to pay for any big or significant meal and at times not even thank me which for me irritated me the most as manners cost nothing. 

I brought it up to her in a mature and calm manner just to seek clarity & to communicate my feelings. She immediately got on the defensive and blew up; saying “she has expectations and standards, men should lead, take the initiative and no man has ever treated her that way” whilst previously telling me multiple times her “narcissistic” ex cheated on her numerous times and treated her like poo. 

Later that evening I noticed she was back on bumble shopping around and her replies became drier and drier so I left it for a few days. 

Last night, I sent her a Hail Mary: 

“Hey, just wanted to check in. I noticed things felt a bit off earlier this week, and I’m not sure where we stand. It has and you have been on my mind ever since. I messed up. I should’ve replied to your last message, and I’m sorry I didn’t. The truth is, I didn’t really know what to say. I care about you, I’ve enjoyed what we’ve had and I have missed you this week. I would like to talk. If you’re feeling differently; I understand. Whatever you decide, no pressure and hard feelings. If this is the end, I wish you the best.“

She replied: “I truly wish you the best” 

💀

She hasn’t blocked me and she still follows me on socials so I really don’t know what her game is but I do know I won’t be reaching out. 

Maybe telling her how I felt insulted/offended her but that was never my intention. Or maybe she does have high expectations. Who knows. I guess communicating your feelings just opens a can of worms.

I used to think I imagined her.

The Grand Floridian was always a little too polished for me, like a wedding cake you weren’t allowed to touch. But in the early twenty-teens, I’d go sometimes, just to sit in the lobby and pretend I belonged. The band would play up on the balcony, the chandelier would glitter like something out of Gatsby, and I’d sip a drink or an overpriced coffee and let the air conditioning convince me I had my life together.

That’s where I saw her.
Lynn, the Teddy Bear Lady.

She looked like something from a turn-of-the-century travel poster, all high collars and quiet dignity. She didn’t just stroll in. She arrived, pushing a pram filled with teddy bears dressed in ballgowns and sailor suits. Dozens of them. They weren’t thrown in like prizes from a fair. They were arranged. Positioned. Like they’d been invited.

She sat near the grand staircase, as if that was her rightful seat. Not performing. Not asking for anything. Just listening to the music, smoothing the hem of a bear’s dress, smiling gently at children who approached but never speaking first. I remember watching a little girl hand her one of those plastic tiaras from the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, and Lynn, without missing a beat, bowed her head and let the girl crown her.

I spoke to her once. Asked her the names of her bears. She told me two or three, and they weren’t silly names. They were old-fashioned, proper, like Marguerite and Sebastian. I asked if she came often and she just nodded, like that was answer enough. And then the music swelled and she turned her head, eyes closed, lost in it.

That’s all.
That’s all I remember.

Years later, I went looking for her. Not on purpose, exactly, but I started asking cast members and regulars. Some nodded vaguely. Some lit up and said, “Oh, yes - the Teddy Bear Lady, she used to come here every day!” And some looked at me like I’d made her up. One bartender swore he’d worked there a decade and never seen such a person.

The internet has scraps of her. A blurry photo here. A message board thread there. But nothing solid. No full name. No obituary. No confirmed end.

Maybe she was real.
Maybe she was a ghost.
Or maybe she was just someone who refused to let magic be something you grow out of.

I know I saw her. I know I did.
But every year, the memory feels softer around the edges, like something smudged in the Florida humidity.

Still, every time I hear a piano echo through a lobby, I glance at the stairs.
Just in case.

Let the road to the 2026 Kentucky Derby begin!



**Sunday, June 29, 2025**

**Churchill Downs**

**Race: 6 (3;18 PM EST)**

**Bashford Manor Stakes**

**1)** Although still a maiden, **Password**’s debut was impressive. This $450,000 son of Uncle Mo broke slowly, was shuffled back shortly thereafter, drifted wide on the turn, but then found his best stride and was absolutely flying late to get second. He might get there this time with a better break and the added distance. 

**2)** **Spice Runner** is a full brother to Grade: 1 winner Gunite who ran a field high 88 Equibase Figure in winning his debut. Solid favorite and clearly the one to beat. 

**3)** **Comport** is another who ran an eye-catching race winning his debut, finishing ahead of my top pick in the process. 

  


**Race: 7 (3:51 PM EST)**

**Debutante Stakes**

**1) Americathegreat** is full sister to Grade: 3 Stakes winner First Captain and the $2 million Sedona. After a slow break in her debut, this filly, like Password, was flying late, making up an astounding 11 lengths in a five furlong race. She should be tough with a clean break and more distance.

**2) Essential Coffee** absolutely galloped in her debut only to be DQ-ed and placed second. She is the one to beat here. 

**3)** **Percy’s Bar** was visually impressive winning her debut at Keeneland in April. 

Also consider: **Color Comin’ In** wired maidens in her debut and finished ahead of my top pick while doing so................ **Light Won Up** came from off the pace to win her debut at Santa Anita and her trainer says “*She is all racehorse.*”
