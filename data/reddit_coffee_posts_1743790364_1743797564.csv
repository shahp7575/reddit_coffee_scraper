In June 2021, the Bettadapura police recovered an unidentified female skeleton along with a saree, undergarments, and chappals near the Cauvery River. Without forensic confirmation, the police assumed the remains belonged to Mallige.  

Suresh was arrested and forced to sign documents confessing that the skeletal remains were his wife’s. A chargesheet was filed, and he was jailed for murder despite his consistent claims of innocence.

He was taking my son to school and started leaving 45 min early we only live maybe 20/30 min with traffic from his school. I asked him why he was leaving so early and he snapped and said I am stopping for coffee. I was like ok I didn't know you didn't have to get snappy. He said I told you already, you should learn to listen. He had not told me so I was confused. He knew I was upset cause when he tried to kiss me I said he was rude and he said we'll let's try to have a good day. We never talk about how he talked to me so I was still upset. I didn't want to even go to lunch but I thought he may say something and make it right. He never did and instead got mad at me for ruining the day. He then started to bring up things he was mad at me about from weeks ago that we had already settled. I told him to stop and we can talk when we get home. He began hitting the table and rasing his voice so I grabbed my things and left him. I told him to call an Uber and we can talk when he got home.

1jrlb5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_roasters/comments/1jrlb5z/the_new_tariffs_and_initial_thinking_on_how_it/,The new tariffs and initial thinking on how it will affect coffee,"Hello! Green coffee trader here. I'd like to chat a little bit about the tariffs and how we are dealing with them on our side of things. I want to try to educate everyone so that we can all be on the same page in these confusing times. I'm not here to chat about why the tariffs are a thing, but I am here to help us all understand what to do now.

As we're all aware, the new tariffs are a thing that everyone will have to deal with. These tariffs will affect the coffee world especially roughly as some of the highest tariffed countries are the largest producers of coffee.

[Take a look at this article with the chart included](https://dailycoffeenews.com/2025/04/03/here-are-the-new-us-tariffs-on-major-coffee-producing-and-exporting-countries/) as to which countries will be affected by tariffs and by how much. As you can see, Vietnam and Indonesia are being hit the hardest with a 46% and 32% tariff respectively. Now, you may not buy Vietnamese coffee to drink, but it is a huge component in the larger coffee ecosystem. This increase in price will have an affect which we are still waiting to see exactly what it is. Indonesia as a favorite of the specialty coffee world will either see a price spike or limited availability on store shelves as it will be very expensive.

**How will the tariffs work in regards to coffee?**

In very simplified terms, the tariff percent increase will affect all coffee brought into the USA and it will vary based on the list above. Green coffee traders will pay this fee and then pass it down to roasters. It will then be on the roasters to decide how they will pass this cost increase on to the customers. We are advising our clients (I'm a green coffee importer) to look into staying away from the hardest hit countries as there is no wiggling around the tariffs. We are suggesting that they alter their blends and find alternatives to the hardest hit countries. Talk to your green broker. We've had literally every single customer call us over the past few days to talk about it. Your green supplier wants to work with you and be fair to all. They won't try to pawn off tariff rates to you if they are not applicable.

**How will this affect the consumer?**

This is still unclear, but expect to see a large price jump OR limited availability for Indonesian and Nicaraguan coffees. For everything else, you should expect anywhere from a 10% increase to even higher for your daily cup or pound of coffee purchased. To reiterate, this is still very early in this new normal so things may change. However, you can definitely expect to see coffee prices rise. How much and if there are any other greater effects on the coffee market as a whole is still to be seen.

**Details:**

* GCA contract states that, “Any duty or tax whatsoever, imposed by any Governmental Agency at Destination, subsequent to the making of this contract, shall be borne by the buyer.” This means that if you are buying SPOT (in a few months when the now tariffed coffee hits the US ports) the green supplier will charge you the countries tariffed rate. If you are buying coffee directly from producers at country of origin, you will pay the applicable tariff.
* The tariff percentage increase will be ""built in"" to your quoted price. It's up to each company to decide if this will be its own line item or not. 
* The details at my company are still up in the air, but it seems like at least we will just increase each coffees ""base value"" by the appropriate countries tariff rate.
* There is no way around these tariffs. I can almost guarantee that no green coffee supplier will eat the cost of the tariffs. Everyone from Folgers to Frank's Corner Coffee Shop will be charged these tariffs.
* In theory, these tariff rates are fluid. If one country makes a deal, the tariff rates will be adjusted. As it reads now, everything on the water by April 5th will NOT have the tariff applied. Anything after that will. So, expect the same if tariff rates go down.

When I took the lid off, this is what greeted me.  That's the teabag floating in the milky brew. I did not complain because, well, British. I never normally go to coffee shops, so I don't know - is it normal to immediately pour the cold milk on top of the teabag? Or am I just fussy? (After 30 minutes it had still not brewed, so I left it on the table)

If your the person who made the other post I can go into more detail if you need but know I'm winging it so far. 

I'll start by saying I've not really got a clue what I'm doing but I'm trying to basic a/b stuff and seeing what I can get from it. I have done a few runs so far but haven't hit that magic yet and want to try to dial in what I'm doing to improve. Either way I am enjoying the process and having fun. Each try has been with 50g of powdered leaf, the process will follow below. The first result turned into a resin from trying to do an ethanol wash but I'm still going to try to dehydrate it but it's not a huge concern. 2nd produced a usable powder of around 1.4g but seemed kinda weak. I tried to precipitate more with ice cold ethanol while the solution was in an ice bath after basifying and I'm guessing as it filtered it warmed and pulled out alkaloids but I'm not sure. The third run was my last/current and produced a cleaner and more potent powder. No ethanol was used to help precipitate this time and produced about .85g total. Here's the basic outline and some of my thoughts on problems and what to do after the outline. 

Everything I use is basic kitchen tek and have no access to special equipment. THIS IS NOT A GUIDE. If you're learning, so am I, so take this with a grain of salt.



# Method:

1. Prepare a solution to \~4-4.4pH, using distilled water and 5% vinegar totaling 500ml at 9:1 (450:50ml) ratio for 50g leaf. Then I do an overnight freeze and thaw the solution the next day. 
2. This soaks for 3 days in the dark, swirling around the solution to mix it a few times per day.  
3. Filter the plant out and soak it again in a fresh 250ml \~4.4pH solution for one more day. 
4. The plant is filtered out again and liquid added to the original solution. I imagine doing this another time would still yield results.
5. Add sodium carbonate and get the solution to around 9-10pH.
6. Let the precipitate settle for an hour or two at least and used a turkey baster to remove as much solution as possible. The removed liquid is filtered first to catch anything then the precipitate at the end by itself so the filter doesn't clog. During this phase I spoon over the solution to collect any oily or bubbly layers on top after the base. I also think leaving this to settle for a day would be better as explained in the notes.
7. This precipitate is air dried on the filter and then rubbed or creased off the filter to create a crude powdery extract dark brown and dull in color. Small chunks can be ground easily. Though filter fibers are a problem. 

# Results:

This produced about .85g of a dark brown dull dry material at the end. It seemed to be around \~40% mit if I had to guess. More info in notes.



# Notes and scattered thoughts: 

I've been running into more precipitation after filtering so I'm thinking letting the base sit for in the fridge for a day or so before filtering precipitate might be a better idea to let it keep precipitating and settle well. Filtering too soon seems to be hurting the yield a bit. It was originally a .7g pull but I pulled an extra .15g of precipitate filtering the solution again the next day as I saw more alkaloids crashing out in the solution after the first filter.

Using coffee filters is a bit of a nightmare for getting everything off without an ethanol wash but seems to work well enough so far, just need to use minimal filters at the end and try to keep the precipitate concentrated instead of spread out over the filter if working with smaller amounts like this. 

I've been yielding around .8g of what I'd guess would be at \~40% mit but it's really hard to estimate. It's fairly effective but not as much of a well being boost as I thought, I think there's a good amount of secondaries from the 64mg test I've done so far from the first precipitate. The first and second precipitate collection look different as well. The first looks clean, dry, and lighter brown. The second darker and shiny. I've only tested the first precipitate yield and that felt nice but a little lacking in mit balance compared to the secondaries. I want to test a bit of the 2nd yield to find out if the mit was crashing out later and is more concentrated here. Maybe it will balance out when added together.

Defatting before basic would would be a nice upgrade in the process. I've found if I try to refine this further with an ethanol wash I end up with resin/wax that doesn't want to dry. It's ruined a batch so far by making it into tiny amount of resin. I could actually use some help in this part of the process. The liquid gold nectar of the gods ethanol looks so nice but turns to immeasurable disappointment when dried and scraped to goop so far. :'( Maybe freezing and recrystallizing would be a better way to go to avoid the wax of hell phase?

This is my biggest pain point when trying to do ethanol washing and seems to make the stuff much harder to turn into a powder again. I'm still working on some filter wash resin at the moment. Dehydrating at about 130 for 6-12 hours and it's almost dry finally. And that's after air drying as much ethanol as possible, scraping and spreading multiple times throughout. 

\---

Thanks for taking the time to read if you got his far. The ramble is real but I've been lurking this sub and getting inspired. Anyways, how am I doing so far? It's all been trial and error but I seem to be on the right track. This has been really fun to learn so far and I want to be able to find my magic recipe one day. I've had little to no guidance so I have no clue how well I'm doing. I could really use some ideas and advice on how to improve this or if it's even worth doing this way. I would like to get more yield than what I'm currently getting but am okay with the lower amounts if the concentration seems worth it. Again I'm working with kitchen tek levels.

**TLDR:**

It's just a rough outline of what I've tried so far that needs refinements. THIS IS NOT A GUIDE. I'm a noob who is just trying stuff. It creates a usable material but the yield and potency could be improved. I don't really know what I'm doing but I'm having a good time so far. If someone wants to come along help with some pointers or advice that'd be wonderful!",1,1743796985.0,Kratom_Extractors,0,1.0,False
1jrl7th,https://www.reddit.com/r/deathbattle/comments/1jrl7th/akanes_bizzare_start_a_death_battle_fan_fic/,Akane's Bizzare Start | A Death Battle Fan Fic,"Akane Shinomiya was in hell. As she stood waiting at Shibuya Station for the next train, she knew this to be true. Because what awaited her were cubicles boxing in nobodies. White neon tubes in the sky giving light to places the sun outside the glass wall couldn’t reach. And the clanking of keyboards. She once went to a mixer once(no success), and whenever anyone wanted to ask her what her job was, she quickly changed the subject. She had difficulty explaining it to anyone. It was dull and unimportant. That’s how she described it the one time she ever did. By the time she had gotten off work and waited to come back home, She had accepted that nothing exciting was ever going to happen. …And then she heard what sounded like a flesh balloon popping. The sudden reverberation pushed her to the floor. She panicked, not knowing what was going on. She stared at what remained of the man that stood next to her. His head splattered across the floor in front of her. Her eyes twitched, she was shaking slightly , and she was desperately trying to say something, anything. But only hints of her descent into complete paralyzation came out. How could he have died? It couldn’t have been a gun. No one in Japan owned one of those. Was it some crazed American tourist? Come to think of it, why was she okay? How come the bullet didn’t hit her? It was like him, and only him was targeted. Who could have done this? And then she felt a hand touch her face. She didn’t worry about it. Because she didn’t have time to worry about it. Because the same thing happened to her. Akane Shinomiya was dead.

Akane Shinomiya woke up in a hospital room, clean and sterile, with a headache. A pretty bad one at that. She had no idea where she was. Looking around the room, she noticed her left arm was plugged up to an IV filled with a strange green substance. There was something written on it but it was completely alien to her. It wasn’t English, that was for sure. It wasn’t Chinese, she’d recognize if any of them was kanji. It wasn’t any language she knew about. In fact, the symbols seemed to be entirely unearthly. And besides the IV, the empty tray next to it, and a chair near her door, the entire room was empty, the black out curtains shutting her off from the outside world. Even with the headache though, she was able to hear some skirmishing outside. As her senses began to clear up, a man in a black suit came through the door.

“Ms. Shinomiya, Correct?” The man closed the door behind him and walked to the front of her bed. “You probably have a lot of questions. Like what’s with the headache? Well, let me answer that, can I ask you something? …Do you remember anything?” The man calmly asked.

“...yeah I was at the train station waiting to get home and then…” It came back to her. The sensation of existing and then not. “Was that a dream?” Akane asked right on the edge of losing it. The man just stood there for a moment.

“...Miss, at times like this, I think-”

“Was that a dream?” Akane asked again, sternly this time. The man sighed to himself.

“No it wasn’t. The man next to you at the station really is dead and so were you a couple hours ago. That’s where the headache comes from. The pain always remains last. One guy we brought back got third degree burns before he died, so he couldn't feel anything for a bit. It was kinda funny in all honesty-”

“OK, wait a minute, I didn’t even think about that yet. How am I still alive? What is this?” Akane pointed to her left arm, where the IV tube was inserted. “Who are you?” The man glanced at it and then back at her.

“Alright, that seems like as good a start as any. My name is Han and that is Lime flavored Kool-Aid.” Akane briefly looked at the IV bag before staring at Han like a mom when her child blames their imaginary friend for the broken vase. “Direct from the source. He likes to send us variety packs though and our documents showed you like lime, so it seemed appropriate.” It was Akane’s turn to sigh now.

“Well, no matter how I’m back. I’m grateful for you saving me. So when will I be discharged? I do need to go back to work tomorrow. Rent’s been kicking my ass lately and-”

“Yeah, I was afraid we were going to need to talk about that.” Han said with a look of unease on his face. He went towards the blinds. “Uh, that’s not going to be possible.” He pulled the curtains back to reveal a swirling vortex of reds, blues, and greens. “Getting you back home that is.” Suddenly Akane is back at that station. Overwhelmed by a sense of the unknown. Han closed the curtains again and walked back. “We’re currently in between one universe and another. As far as everyone back home thinks, you’re still dead and we need to keep it that way.” Akane tried to find her composure. She wasn’t succeeding. “Do you need a minute?” that calm voice Han put on when he first introduced himself came back. Akane shook her head yes and that was Han’s signal to leave the room.

Akane wasn’t quite sure how to deal with this. So she didn’t. Instead she went back to her childhood. She had a fascination with outer space as a kid, ever since she first watched *Voltron*. From then on, she made it her goal to go find her own planet and discover her own wonders. She giggled to herself. *That’s one ambitious kid.* Akane looked back at the black out curtains, now knowing what was behind them. *I wonder where she is now?*

Han came back an hour later, a cup of coffee in hand.

“Just the way you like it.” Akane, having calmed down at this point, carefully took the cup and took a gentle sip. She looked down at the cup. He was correct.

“Why?” She quietly asked.

“Huh?” He responded. She gazed back up at Han.

“Why can’t I go back home? Why does everyone have to assume I’m dead?” Han didn’t have an answer. At least not yet. So he walked to the lonely chair near the door, picked it up, placed it at the front of Akane’s bed, and sat in it.

“I work for an organization called OSA. The Omniversal Survival Agency. It is our job to protect, well, everything. We believe in stability. Hold on.” Han reached into the inside of his coat and took a folder out and gave it to Akane. She opened it up, only to see a face she had seen on TV a dozen times.

“This is that terrorist right?” she asked.

“Yes, Tomura Shigaraki. Of course you know him, he’s from your world. But he’s not the one who killed you. The one who killed you is right behind him.” Akane flipped the document to find someone who she had not seen, even once. 

“His name is Mahito and he is not from your world. He plays by entirely different rules. You could still be alive if he wasn’t there. But because the barrier between universes wasn’t stable. You and several other innocent civilians died. Same thing happened to me. I was working over in Mongolia for a client, hoping to get back home too, when I was caught in a large explosion. Turned out some bounty hunter pissed off the wrong angel of vengeance. Long story. Point is, when the wrong people are in the wrong universe, a lot of damage can be done. In order to keep your universe stable, we can’t just let someone who should be dead back in. I’m sorry.” Akane held her right elbow in her left palm as she repeatedly pinched the bridge of her nose with her eyes closed.

“Alright, so what am I supposed to do?”

“You could join us.” Her eyes were wide open as she froze.

“What?”

“We want you to join OSA.” Han said with a cheerful grin. Akane let her right hand fall beside her.

“Why would I ever do that? What would you even want from me? I’m nothing special. I’m nobody.”

“That’s exactly why we want you.” Akane looked at Han with confusion. “You know who James Bond is, right? Everyone knows who James Bond is. You couldn’t possibly have James Bond spying in real life because everyone would recognize him on sight. But no one would ever suspect you because they wouldn’t even recognize you. You look so unspecial to the point that you are special to us. You are the opposite of suspicious. But **we** know that you are special. I mean, it says right here in your docs that you used to be called “Baddie” in college. I mean that’s got to have a story behind that.” Akane blushed a little at that. “Look, the point is, we know you’ve always had bigger ambitions in life. OSA is an opportunity to reach some of those and even go further beyond. We won’t just send you into outer space, we’ll send you there so you can save outer space. So what do you say?”

Akane glanced back at the black out curtains, knowing full well what was behind them. And then she looked back into herself. Back to that kid that laid in the greenest grass and gazed upon the night sky and its infinite infinities. And then back to Han, with that slightly-trying-to-hard smile of his.

“Well, it’d definitely beat my old job.” 

“Excellent!” Han clapped and jumped out of his seat. “Now I can introduce you to your new partner. He’s been waiting outside actually. Although, I should warn you, he’s a little sensitive about the way he died.”

“I did not die!” Akane and Han looked back to the door, only to find a masked jackal standing upright at the entrance.

“Well you would’ve if we hadn’t rescued you, Infinite. You did have your entire skeleton crushed.” Han pointed out, although clearly trying to be gentle about it.

“Are you calling me weak? Because I’m not. I am not we-”

“HRRRNGH!”

“Ah!” Infinite threw his palm out at what turned out to be one of the younger nurses just passing by, laughing to themselves. He lowered it and looked back at the two, who said nothing. “I’m not weak.” he said under his breath.

*Well, this is certainly much more interesting first day than my last job.* Akane thought to herself.",1,1743796970.0,deathbattle,1,1.0,False

There was a pit outside in the way of the door, it was on a leash but the owner still had zero control. It looked like they weren't going in so I skirted around them to enter. 

As soon as I finished paying, they came in so I was sandwiched between the counter and this hyperventilating, slobbering pitbull. I made a face and rolled my eyes, thinking that if I hadn't already paid I'd just say fuck this and leave. I looked up and the barista was glaring at me, I assume because she saw me be grossed out? And of course the behavior got encourage by a couple of morons walking by who stopped to pet the dog while oohing and aaahing like they've never seen such a thing. 

Got my coffee and walked around the counter, hoping there was another exit. There wasn't. But as I was looking for one I passed a woman sitting at a booth with a chihuahua. That dog was sitting with its asshole plastered to the booth, paws up on the countertop. 

So I had to go back around and squeeze by this owner who did nothing as her dog yanked closer to try to lick my pants. Normally I'd say something directly but since it was clear how *that* would go  I just made a health dept report. The part that I hope is a good sign is I actually got a reply the other day:

""Hello,

My name is [name] and I am the health inspector assigned to the complaint you submitted for [coffee shop].  I wanted to let you know I visited the facility today to remind the owner and food workers that pet dogs are not allowed inside the coffee shop.  We discussed how only service animals are allowed and a handout was provided that has guidance on how to handle dogs that come into the facility.  If you have any further questions please feel free to reach out.

Thanks.""


The add on of ""service animals"" gives me pause since we know how much dog owners lie and think their mongrels are beyond reproach, but I'm hoping that the rest of it is true at least. I like to think this means that most people are reaching their fucking limit with this behavior and something will actually start being done. 

As exhausting as I know it is, keep making reports through the avenues that we have when it comes to dog owners and their shitty, entitled behavior. ",2,1743796839.0,Dogfree,0,1.0,False

A personal piece. Wanted to draw how i see myself. 

I've always loved Zoroark. Like, since the beginning. It's one of the reasons why I prefer to be seen as one. Gender envy, y'know?

Something life threatening had happened to me not too long ago. As such, I found it fitting to draw myself as hisuian as well. 

It shows how I lived despite it all. Yet, there are times I use my illusion to hide the fact I went through that trauma, masking myself as my unovan form. I don't want everyone to know i almost died. No one likes discussing major life events. 

So I made this whole thing. You can tell which one I did first lmao. Rushed it with the first one as I did that one last believe it or not. In a coffee shop as I make this and they close soon, hence the rush. I don't have the drive to art at home like I do here. Not even in the comfort of my own room. I'm still learning. Still getting there in terms of my artstyle. But I know I improved so much since I picked up a sketchbook after so many years. Been winging it on Ibis with just my finger with no base before this. I forgot how good it feels to actually use your wrist lmao. 

But I do have a moral. Life can be rough. Especially right now, as things are getting so, so bad...

Yet, we must still truck on. No matter what. You matter. Show the world your worth. Show the world there is light. Be there for those you love. Offer kindness, even if it's miniscule, people look back on those acts and reminisce on how it helped them keep going. Remind those who question their worth and meaning in your life that you do care. Prove to the world that corruption won't keep you down. 💜",11,1743796362.0,zoroark,0,1.0,False

**I**

    You must understand. I just started working for The Scientist, when a few weeks ago they told me what their plans were. The scientist ran their fingers through their disheveled head of hair. At the same time, their thick glasses slid down their nose, lubricated by their own sweat dripping from their furrowed brow. They were ranting, again, in the kind of way that made you want to tune out and day dream. It had been months since the beginning of my internship under their tutelage, a mere drop in the ocean of the career of a physicist.

 ""A Particle Accelerator, that's what I need to get my hands on.""

 I paused and thought of the different ways that seemed impossible to achieve. That wasn't something you could rent from your local hardware store, it was some serious equipment. You couldn’t pick one up, or have one made. You had to petition the facility and its overseeing organization for the chance to schedule some time to use such a complex. I took a sip of coffee. Bitter. It needed more sugar. 

 ""And what will this do for us, exactly?"" I said, dismissive and aloof, focused only slightly on their words at that moment as I looked around for something to fix up my coffee. 

""If I can isolate the Decoherence Modulation Boson in an accelerator, under the right conditions, --"" They continued as I looked around the office. Cluttered with paper, it was drab and sucked the soul out of you the way an old school or prison might after years of being there. I sipped my mug. The bitterness bit my tongue again. I wondered if there was any sugar around here. I felt alone for a moment, as if peace had washed over me. I began to listen again. “--might be the necessary conditions to synthesize this particle and prove my hypothesis correct. I pray to god that this works out.” Honestly, I wanted it to pan out as well. They were talking about their petition for funding and time to access and use an accelerator, and success could mean an opportunity for me to further my career. Hell, I wouldn't mind getting my hands on a full size particle accelerator! Imagine commanding the raw power and precision of something easily seen from the sky, the pinnacle of engineering!

As I rose from my stupor I noticed a shimmer of light on a crucifix on the wall above the door. Weird. Maybe it was just the light from the sun? I look at the fuzzy text on my laptop. Damn, I forgot my contacts and my glasses were nowhere to be found.

The Scientist was working on groundbreaking research. Something like Einstein levels of simplicity mixed with cosmic convergence. They saw life as a set of dynamics, a play, a dance whose rhythm must be heard and felt in order to be a part of it. It was through this philosophy they developed their theory. The Decoherence Modulation Boson or “perception particle"". It all started out as a thought experiment they said, a funny idea cooked up during a coffee break with some of their colleagues. The idea is that this particle exists under precise conditions. In fact, it only exists in the conditions necessary to synthesize it, yet is an inseparable part of our natural universe. It was supposed to be a play on the double slit experiment, a joke between eggheads regarding duality and perception. Somehow through obsession or brute force, it amalgamated into something more. They had begun to see the particle as a possible way to modulate their perspective through the multiverse. A sort of lens with which to view various realities. For example, imagine yourself at a crowded concert, with all of the background noise drowning out the music. This DMB would supposedly allow you to not only focus on the music through the noise, but hear other songs being played at the same time. Like tuning to different frequencies while receiving them all simultaneously.

 The Scientist began basing their whole career on the hypothesis, slowly but surely working their way up the cut throat ladder of academic funding to continue this thought experiment. The particle would allow for us to modulate decoherence, and see into the multiverse.

“It's our destiny to discover” The Scientist would always say “We need to look deeper” they would insist, but for me sometimes the work just felt like that and nothing more, work. 

I had been helping them with their studies and experiments ever since I finished college with my degree in theoretical physics, and was looking for the first apprenticeship I could take that would help with my financial situation. Seeing this was the first position in a related field that actually paid something, I jumped on the opportunity. It was this or Starbucks. Somehow I stumbled upon this job on a listing on a website for people with my kind of degree and, seeing no other alternative, I decided to fill out an application. It is not all bad, I can always use this to fluff up my resume and springboard to something greater. Sometimes it feels like we are really on to something great. Sure its theories right now, but maybe one day we could use this particle to understand the particle zoo, maybe even interactions with dark matter and energy. It's exciting stuff,  plus I had always heard throughout school that jobs like this show drive and can really lead to great pay down the line. Potentially opening positions at CERN, NASA, or maybe somewhere in the defense industry. The work was exciting sometimes when something worked out, but nothing always works out. Not the petitions for time at a particle accelerator complex, not petitions for funding, and even The Scientist themselves goes on unmitigated tangents that are anything but productive.

“If what my theories say are true, we may yet find God in these coming days and I wont have to pray at all.” the scientist continued, and their words reverberated in my ears in a way that made me want to celebrate the enjoyment of discovery, but also made me wary of the implications.

 “If He is omniscient, may we find Him and get some answers” I said, trying to almost toast the moment and be encouraging. I sat in my respective corner of the square office on a couch adjacent to their desk with a laptop on my lap. I rubbed the smooth surface of the plastic that holds the screen in place on my laptop. I felt worried after the words lingered in my mind, a type of dread that can only be described as existential.

 “You know I hired you because of your accolades in applied theoretical physics” They say after taking off their glasses and beginning  to clean them on their shirts.

I nodded. I had spent several weeks writing my dissertation and was quite proud of the work I had done.

“I need you to tell me, did the equations work out?” they asked.

I looked over my notes. I had triple checked the work and developed the theory under different conditions and it had seemed to do the impossible. When accounting for the perception particle, we were now able to solve the incompatibility issues surrounding general relativity and quantum field theory. You must understand, such a discovery is the holy grail of quantum theory. With this understanding, we would unlock the potential for instantaneous interstellar travel, the ability to manipulate matter on a subatomic level thereby performing apparent acts of alchemy, and even reverse the degradation of DNA replication associated with aging, and so much more.

 “Yes I have and it's incredible” I say in eager astonishment, but am curious as to how we're now going to make this a reality. Having something proven and planned out on paper was one thing, but producing something replicable and getting the means to actualize it was another. What if we did get the funding and authorizations and it all turned out to be for nothing? What if The Scientist was simply wrong? It wasn't as if our mere dreams could alter reality.

 “ That's perfect. Now all we need to do is publish our findings and then, hopefully, we can get access to some real equipment.” they said giddily.  Everything was in place to truly change our understanding of the world and science, if we could only gain traction in the scientific community. I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride, or maybe it was more hubris. For it was in these moments that I was ignorant, and I wish I could return. The Scientist may have been onto something, but thinking in these monolithic terms concerned me. 

“I need a cigarette” I said, needing a break from work and my troubling thoughts. I get up and head to the smoke pit to just relax and have a thought to myself. I understand that the theory worked, but I still was having trouble comprehending the bigger picture. I put the cigarette in my teeth and felt for the lighter in my pocket. 

To my surprise, The Scientist met me outside, a little more disheveled than before. I tried not to look too deep into it. “Have I ever talked to you about my child?” they said.

I tried to remember the barbecues and pool parties we had attended, and I vaguely could remember a child who seemed bright and full of life.  I took a drag from my menthol. I think I've had enough of today. 

”Yes” I almost whispered through a lung full of tobacco.

The Scientist shuffles over and puts their hand out with their pointer and middle finger extended, ~~with~~ the universal gimmie sign everybody who smokes knows. I flip open the top of my pack, smack the bottom to get one of them to jump out, and I let them bum one. For a while they just sit there staring into space, holding the cigarette like a pencil. I wondered if they were going to make for the lighter ever, but they didn't, they just stood there next to me while I sat on the bench. I could see something stirring behind their eyes as if they were about to burst into tears. I noticed their lip quiver. Whatever emotional torrent they were holding back suddenly broke free and spilled forth uncontrolled. “My child has Leukemia!” they blurt out, crying tears of hate and regret, before dropping their head and whimpering ”I'm sorry, I'm not feeling myself”. I had been reminded about the child's condition at this moment, and The Scientist certainly knew that it was not at the forefront of my mind, but lately the reality of the terminal condition had seemed to really take hold of their psyche.

I'm puzzled at how and why the day is going the way it is, and in all honesty I don’t think I have the energy. I think to myself for a moment before noticing The Scientist having trouble getting the lighter going through their emotional dump. I lean over, take it, and light it for them. “This particle could help everyone, you know. This isn’t just fueled by ambition alone. If I am right, we will be able to undo all sorts of suffering for all of humanity.” 

The Scientist takes a drag of the cigarette and coughs it out. It was then I realized I had never seen them smoke before.

 “If we find this particle it will be the biggest discovery of our lifetimes. You must understand if perception interacts with reality fundamentally that means every thought and action could ripple across infinity. These particles could be the conduit for other interactions to be understood. A NEW UNDERSTANDING OF QUANTUM RELATIONS THAT COULD REVERSE ENTROPY AND CURE MY CHILD!.” The Scientist is overwhelmed and takes another drag. The silence filled the air. This was sudden and disheartening information. I felt stuck in the moment.

 “It's ok, if the calculations work out we will get the funding, it all just takes time.” I say, waiting for a response. The time now almost seems irrelevant in comparison.  

The Scientist laughs almost manically “If we prove this, time will not matter.” 

I begin to feel scared but comfort myself in another inhale of the tobacco. I looked at the scientist again. Sometimes moments feel like hours with all these implications. I'm as intrigued as anyone but I don't want to get emotionally invested. It is just a job and I don't want to lose myself. I look at the scientist.  I could swear I saw their eyes glow. Must have been the tears in their eyes I thought.",1,1743795870.0,u_lanethegod69,0,1.0,False

1jrkpol,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrkpol,"Lamb mandi, okra stew, and tandoor bread @ House of Mandi (Anaheim, $$)","A few weeks back, me and two friends hit up [House of Mandi](https://www.houseofmandianaheim.com/), a Yemenese restaurant in Anaheim's Little Arabia district. They're in a horseshoe minimall [off Brookhurst, north of Orange](https://maps.app.goo.gl/sLt4XEa227e1RkXS8). 

We came for lunch during Ramadan so, not surprisingly, this place was nearly empty; I'm a little surprised they were even open for lunch but I can only imagine that this place was *popping* during dinner, once people were allowed to break fast. 

Regardless, I've been wanting to try this place for a while, never having had Yemenese food before and I was not remotely disappointed. This meal was *awesome*, as good as the lunch I had at [Al Baraka](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodLosAngeles/comments/1ilkgzy/lunch_al_baraka_palestinian_restaurant_in_anaheim/), the nearby Palestinian restaurant. 

Mandi refers to a Yemenese rice dish usually served with some kind of meat and if we're going to House of Mandi...well, we're ordering some mandi. We got the lamb mandi, one of the more traditional preparations. The lamb is slow-cooked while wrapped in aluminum foil and arrives to the table as you see above. You carefully unwrap the foil and the lamb comes rolling out. There are few things I like better than a good rice pilaf and this one came with (if I recall) fried shallots, raisins, and a nice mix of salt and spices. While this was a very generous platter, easily feeding the three of us, I would have been tempted to polish this off by myself if you set it in front of me. 9.5/10

We also ordered the hrada of seltah: okra stewed with ground beef, whipped fenugreek and an umami-rich tomato base. This comes served with tandoor flat bread, similar to a large naan, which was perfect for dipping into the stew.   
Stew: 8.5/10 (not the biggest okra fan)  
Tandoor Bread: 9/10  
  
Finally, my friend wanted to try Yemenese coffee so he ordered the coffee set which is very pretty and the coffee is very strong.  ",5,1743795711.0,FoodLosAngeles,3,1.0,False

I ended up making bourbon based liqueur for the drink with the following recipe. 

Bourbon Coffee Liqueur:
-1 cup brown sugar
-1 cup water
Mix both on stove to make brown sugar simple syrup. Then pour in large mason jar with:
-1 cup bourbon
-1 stick vanilla bean
-2x long shots of espresso

Let steep for an hour in the fridge, then add 1.5oz liqueur, 1.5oz vodka, 1x shot fresh espresso. Shake with ice, pour and add orange peel. It’s honestly better than the martini, like a chocolate coffee old fashioned. Enjoy!",4,1743795598.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

1jrkloa,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1jrkloa/hes_arriving_tonight/,He’s arriving tonight,"It all started a month ago with a strange dream that kept repeating itself night after night. Train tracks stretched into darkness, and I was standing beside them, waiting for something. Far in the distance, I could hear a sound. It wasn’t an engine and it wasn’t the clatter of wheels. It was something slower, heavier, almost organic. It felt like a heartbeat. The heartbeat of a *train*.

At first, I didn’t pay much attention. Just another weird dream, I thought. Probably stress from work. But then strange things began to happen. 

Scratches appeared on the wall next to my bed. I started noticing marks in the dust, like something had been crawling across the floor. My palms were covered in raw scrapes, as if I had spent the night holding on to scalding metal.

One night, the dream shifted. I was standing closer to the tracks, and for the first time I saw the shape of the train emerging from the fog. I couldn’t see the details, but I felt its gaze settle on me. It wasn’t headlights. It was eyes.

Suddenly, I was inside. I don’t remember how I got there. The carriage was dark, filled with workbenches, books, bizarre tools, and people screaming in voices I couldn’t understand. I tried to look at their faces, but they were distorted, like someone had tried to recreate them from memory and got it wrong. One figure stood out among the rest, tall, wearing a hood, giving silent commands to the others. I tried to get closer to see his face, but he noticed me first. That was the worst part. The moment our eyes met, something ancient and primal took hold of me. I woke up at four in the morning, drenched in sweat and shaking.

There was a scrap of paper lying on the floor next to my bed. It had three words on it. He’s arriving tonight.

The next day I convinced myself it was just anxiety. I stayed off social media, didn’t drink coffee, even tried a guided meditation video. None of it helped.

That night, I didn’t dream. There was no sleep, no darkness. Only the tracks. They twisted sideways at impossible angles, like geometry had finally given up. I felt movement beneath me, but couldn’t see the source. And then the sound returned.

*Thump. Thump. Thump*.

Only this time, it wasn’t a heartbeat. It was *breathing*.

I turned, and for the first time, I saw its eyes. Not lights. Eyes. Deep inside the train’s mechanical skull, something was watching me with cold, fascinated curiosity. Like a person studying an ant farm. I couldn’t move. I could only listen as something whispered directly into my head. The voice was thick with rust, like it traveled through pipes slick with oil and blood.

You held out for a long time. But everything ends.

I woke up with my mattress soaked in water. At least I thought it was water. It was black. It smelled like diesel.

There was a mark on my palm. Burned into the skin. A symbol like two sets of rails twisted into the shape of an eye.

I don’t remember how it got there. But I know what it means.

I recently moved from Wealth Management to a BDO position with an SBA Lender that mainly does CRE SBA loans, so far I love the position and really like the lending side of things. I am not new to sales and prospecting. Currently, I am cold calling commercial realtors since they're a main referral source, I am only doing what I've been comfortable with for 3 years... Cold Calling.

1. Is cold calling commercial realtors and business brokers a good strategy, if so, should I try and focus on setting time on their calendar for a coffee chat or Zoom meeting, or should get straight to the point asking if there are any deals I can help them with?

2. Would it be smart and have any other lenders tried to prospect directly to the business owners to see if they need to refi/buy and then give the lead to a realtor to handle the sale while you handle the funding? If so what ways would you recommend getting their contact info

  
3. I am starting to attend networking events, but it feels slow, there are only so many events scheduled in a Month. Are there any networking events or groups recommended to attend?

I'm disappointed in myself, the DougDoug community, and myself again for having to make this post. Unfortunately, the bald, blonde menace got to me — he metaphorically skinned me, tore my flesh asunder, and pantsed me in the schoolyard locker room (metaphorically). I woke up one day stained by his visceral, disgusting presence. It coated me like a slime, covering my body from head to toe. Unwashable, unremovable — I was stained, sullied. This was all his fault.

What could he have done, you ask? I'll tell you. I'll tell you what that damned menace did.

He made me *fucking like the song ""Coffee"" by Supersister.*

Oh, sure, it started ironic. ""I'm building something! Let me put on Supersister. Haha, what a funny joke of a song! It's so GOOFY and there's a cat in the music video! What a jokey, jesty little silly joke!"" Except it wasn't a joke, it was a real. The more I listened to the song, the more the brainworm (or brainlarvae, I should say). It burrowed into my head, using my brain for its 1-2 lifecycle before it would explode out of my head in a brainbeetle. The song is catchy, an earworm like no other. It's disgusting lyrically, with ridiculous innuendo that are only problematic in the hyperspecific circumstance I fall into.

What is that circumstance, you - the cool, cucumberesque viewer - ask? The circumstance is that I'm a GODDAMN LESBIAN!

That's right, DougDoug made me hum and murmur and sing and bop to the very song about a young woman who's hornier for cock then a hen that recently hit puberty! I've been singing about how ""I like my men like I like my coffee - hot, smooth and sweet!"" when instead, it should be ""I like my women like I like my coffee - cold brewed and with gratuitous cold foam!"" That fucker made me look like I'm sexually attracted to men! This is ENTIRELY his fault and I will be researching a relevant lawyer.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some google searches for lawyers to run. Need to pull up some background music first, though (what if I'm on hold?) and...

...

........

*Like a dream, you held my body tight (you held my body tight! Like caffeine, you kept me up all night! I like my men like I like my coffee. Hot, strong and sweet! I....*

The Patelitos puff pastries were warm and perfectly buttery flakey.  They’re available in so many sweet and savory options.  The beef was so yummy, perfectly tender and not greasy.  Other popular flavors include a Strawberry Nutella and Guava Cheese.  Don’t forget to pick up a couple of Croquetas and Tequeños to try.  The chopped ham Croqueta was crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside served with a creamy béchamel sauce drizzle.  

Pair these perfectly snack size pastries with a a coffee bev from their extensive menu of Cuban or Colombian creations to jump start your day.  ✔️ Cafe Con Lèche, they have that.  ✔️ A Colada, which is an espresso plus espumita (sugar cream) drink… yes, please.  ✔️ Or a Cafe Bombon which is espresso with condensed milk, omg.

* increasing **movement** \-- random assortment of things

\---> lost about *7 pounds*, but was *plateauing.*

TODAY: I'm on Day Three of 16:8 IF. Not quite as hard as I thought it might be. 

Things I do during fasting:

* water
* herbal tea
* sleep
* black coffee
* water

**My TIP: Cut back on unhealthy foods big-time** ***before starting IF.***

***Your tips for folks like me?***

1jrk39z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1jrk39z/challenge_time_blocking_vs_habit_stacking_which/,🚀 Challenge: Time Blocking vs. Habit Stacking — Which Saved Me 10 Hours/Week? (Surprising Result),"**🚀 Ever wonder how to actually squeeze an extra 10 hours out of your week?** I know, I know... it sounds like some late-night infomercial. But stick with me here. 😅

So, picture this: **I’m drowning in tasks, deadlines screeching like a falcon, and I’m thinking, “How can I work smarter, not harder?”** Then I stumbled onto two strategies: **Time Blocking** and **Habit Stacking**. Both have their fan clubs, trust me. I mean, self-help geeks rave about them like they’re the secret to immortality. 🤓

**I committed to a one-month challenge: Time Blocking vs. Habit Stacking.** Which one could free up my time and let me slay my to-do list like a productivity ninja?

### Here’s the lowdown on both:

1. **Time Blocking:** Schedule every task into chunks of time. 
   - *Thoughts?* Initially felt like I became President, complete with a minute-to-minute schedule.  
   - *Reality check:* Walking a fine line between organized and insane.

2. **Habit Stacking:** Piggy-backing new habits on existing ones. 
   - *Thoughts?* Sounds like I'm Tetris-ing my life.  
   - *Reality check:* Like a fun game... until you realize you stacked a bad habit by accident. Oops! 🍩

### *Drumroll...* Which worked better?

**Surprisingly, time blocking pulled ahead!**  🌟 Why? I had this epiphany that my brain loves structure like a cat loves an empty box.

- **Mornings:** Had this block for creative stuff—writing, brainstorming... or just snoozing more (let’s be real!).
- **Afternoons:** Meetings and admin tasks where I just pretend to listen (just kidding!).
- **Evenings:** Open space, baby! Browsing Netflix like I have a Ph.D. in Chi... *er, um*... Cinema Studies.

But here's the kicker—while time blocking delivered that sweet sweet time savings, **habit stacking is my secret weapon for those smaller goals.** Trying to floss more? Stick it right after brushing. Wanna journal? Slide it in after morning coffee. ☕

**So, what’s the takeaway?** The real magic was in mixing and matching. Time blocking gave me the broad strokes, while habit stacking filled in the gaps.

**For any of y’all on the fence:** What’s worked for you? Time blocking, habit stacking, or is there some super-secret technique the world needs to know about? I’m all ears... well, eyes, since we’re on Reddit. 👍

Stay awesome, my productivity warriors, and may you find your extra hours this week! Til next time, keep maximizing those good vibes! 🚀✨",1,1743794122.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jrk0wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/comments/1jrk0wl/ami_being_unreasonably/,Ami being unreasonably,"So for context I have worked with my current NF for approximately 3.5 years! I have loved working with the kids for the most part however currently I have really been struggling with them the past couple of months. For reference MB never releases me on time and multiple times a week I’m asked to stay past my hours. Which is fine for most days because I do get paid for overtime for most of my time except when it’s like 10-30 minutes after I was suppose to already be off. This is also in part because I’m like what your gonna pay me $10 for the 30 minutes to me that’s pointless. So instead I just show up the next day like 10 minutes late because in my mind that makes since. If I leave late I’m starting late especially when MB loves to tell me 5-10 minutes before I’m getting off to be like hey my meeting is done which really means it’s going to be another 45 min. MB also is frequently out of town at least once a week which means in those days I have to work from 7am-9PM. I’m always asked by DB like “I’m gonna need you to work late tomorrow……if you can. And of course I have to because if he can’t work then obviously I don’t get paid. 

I’ve also noticed that as of recently DB has been asking me to do a more things that aren’t in my contract. Like Tuesday I came in and his first words were “ you might need to unload the dishwasher I didn’t get time to do it. “ Mind you he is saying all of this with a cup of coffee in hand while standing in front of the dishwasher. Like why would I need to unload a dishwasher that I didn’t load nor did I dirty up the dishes that were in there. Nor is it in my contract. 

Then this is where it gets really beautiful 🙃. This week we have had like a week straight of severe thunderstorms which have required the family to take shelter in what is essentially my work space which is fine. However when I arrived I was told “hey sorry about the mess in the area we had to take shelter so the kids made a big mess and we weren’t able to clean it up. Cool. So I clean up the mess and carry on my merry way. The following day one NK told MB that he wasn’t feeling well so she allowed him to stay home. I found this out once I arrived because they never tell me that the kids are sick until I show up for work. Which is irritating in itself because why do you think it’s ok to put me at risk for also getting sick? Especially when I don’t have health benefits included in the job so if I get sick I have to pay out of pocket and we all know how expensive American health care can be. NK who is 11 pretends to be sick all day right up  until his friends come home from school and then suddenly his sickness is gone! How shocking.  So yesterday I took the kids to an adventure center near us as they were begging to go since they didn’t have school due to severe weather. MB said it was ok so I took them DB currently wasn’t home which is who normally the one who pays me back whatever we spend on our fun days. On the way to the adventure center I texted DB and told him where we were going and that i would pay with my card and that he can just send me back however much we send and he said ok. The afternoon comes and I send him the receipt. He never says anything back but later that night messages me about baby monitor because he couldn’t find it. Again never says anything about my sending me my money back even though I know he saw my message as my message was directly above  the message where he asked about the baby monitor.  

Which now brings us to today. As soon as I walk in this morning I’m met with soo NK who is 12 is staying how because now they are sick even though we spent the whole day prior out of the house and at the adventure center. Now I’m not saying they too are faking but as soon as dad is relaying the message to me that NK is going got be staying home NK is standing behind with a smirk because their sibling pulled the sick card earlier in the week and now they are too. I was also met with yet another “hey sorry for the basement again! We took shelter in basement again last night due to severe weather again”which is true yes because we did have severe weather but it’s not that hard to make the kids clean up their giant messes prior me getting there. The kids are definitely old enough to do so. Especially since I always clean the space at the end of the day but every morning I come back to it destroyed by the kids. So what do I do ? I clean it up of course. Then I come back up the stairs and he’s like also “ Can you do some of their laundry it’s upstairs. I go up the stairs and guess whose laundry is also thrown in with the kids…DB of course. The final and last straw this morning was since he has yet to pay me back for taking the kids to the adventure center I  decided to physically hand him the receipt in hopes that that would remind him that he still hasn’t paid me back. I give him the receipt and he’s like “ thanks I’ll put it in my office “.  That was 5 hrs ago and he has yet to send me my money in addition to the money that I’m owed for overtime. 

I don’t know if this is the beginning of what burn out feels like or if it’s because it’s Friday and I’m irritated at this whole week and I’m just ready to go home in addition to still waiting to get my money back. Someone please tell me do you think I’m being dramatic and unreasonable? How do you address this?",3,1743793950.0,Nanny,0,0.8,False
1jrk07s,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mcat/comments/1jrk07s/should_i_postpone_score_dropped_7_points_from_fl/,Should I postpone? Score dropped 7 points from FL 3 to FL 2,"Ok I know FL 2 causes panic attacks for many, and then all is well after FL 3. Knowing this, and the extreme difficulty in finding childcare for my infant, I took FL 3 before FL 2 to help boost confidence, especially if I couldn't find anyone to watch my child for another FL. Got 510. Then took FL 2 and got a 503. Exam is in three weeks. It involves traveling via plane to the testing center and again, childcare. Which I've arranged. But if I need to retake, it'll be that much harder to find it again. And I really, really want to apply for this cycle for multiple reasons, but not if it means I don't have a decent chance. Most recent GPA (non-trad) is 3.96 (only took prereqs recently at a four-year US uni). WWYD? Some details:

1. This was the first time I took the exam at the same time I'd take it IRL. Usually I take it later in the day. I spent the night at a friend's so she could give baby breakfast, etc. and I could go to the library.
2. Also first time I didn't have water while taking the exam (I get really thirsty).
3. I realize I need to eat more the night before and for breakfast.
4. Some super loud people came in towards the end of CARS, which is usually my strong point. So I probably lost a few points there.
5. I completely bombed B/B. Like one passage I got everything wrong. Before, B/B wasn't necessarily my second best section, but it wasn't my worst. Here's my breakdown for FL 2:

125/128/124/126

For FL 3, it was 124/129/128/129.

Hoping for a 515 or I guess now even 511.

My main challenge in studying for this exam is that I'm a single mother with full custody and no family to help. I'm still nursing her, and she's still waking up in the middle of the night. I pump on the extended lunch break that AAMC has granted, and that sometimes makes me feel maybe too relaxed than I should be (oxytocin wooo). I do a plank, some squats etc to get blood flowing, and drink water, some coffee (I don't drink coffee ever except while taking practice FL and it helps keep me awake), and a light snack. What seems to work for me is an ounce of almonds and a piece of fruit or chia seed packet on the breaks. Lunch I've also worked out to a can of sardines in a pack of oil an either white rice or fruit and almonds.

1jrjvvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingUK/comments/1jrjvvz/im_being_bullied_by_a_band_2/,I’m being bullied by a band 2,"I’ve been a band 7 for about a year. 

There’s a band 2 on my Unit who is an absolute nightmare to manage. She has been allowed to run riot for years, her attendance last year was at 37%, long periods of sickness, particularly when due annual leave, and huge restrictions on practice.

I’ve gone out of my way to make allowances, granted last minute annual leave, specific allocations granted, flexible working granted and there’s been no improvement.

Since I’ve taken over, I’ve been quite strict on sickness and managed through the sickness stages, and strict on her actually having to do the work that she can do. As a result, I’ve been subjected to her spreading nasty rumours about me amongst staff, the worst being I give another staff member lifts home so I can buy weed, I’m trying to force the band 2s out of a job to make savings, I’m planning to sneakily redeploy the band 2s and my personal favourite that I’m having an affair with a consultant. She’s already written letters to the chief nurse about me and complained to matron but all have been squashed as unsubstantiated and it’s been a massive cause of stress. She completely just ignores me at work, goes for cigarette breaks whenever she feels like it, spends the majority of time drinking coffee.

I don’t mind people thinking I’m the bad guy for managing properly but it’s causing an undercurrent of suspicion and I can’t have people thinking I’m on drugs because it’s professional misconduct and also massively untrue.  Rumours I’m not bothered about but when it brings my professionalism into question it’s an issue. She’s very litigious, and knows how to play the system.

I can’t believe the level of power that she thinks she has after all her behaviour. She thinks she’s untouchable and I’m just supposed to sit back and let her behave like this. HR are no help and I just don’t know how to handle it.  Like who does she think she is!

1jrjntk,https://www.reddit.com/r/SIBO/comments/1jrjntk/sibo_vs_wfpb_diet_gi_map_results/,SIBO vs WFPB diet GI MAP results,"Tested positive for SIBO and tried all different treatments but wasn't making any progress until now. I wanted to post my GI MAP results after switching to a whole food plant based diet (WFPB), no refined sugar/alcohol/coffee/caffeine/wheat/gluten/soy. 

It's interesting to note the results show low inflammatory markers (EDN/EPX was 0.11, Calprotectin was 6, and SigA was normal middle range 1210). I was only following the diet for about 2.5months before testing, so that might explain why Zonulin levels were still elevated (148ng/g with a threshold of 175) but I'm assuming they have continued dropping since. For me, this diet is anti-inflammatory which I wouldn't have guessed from all the fruit. I did take some antimicrobials at the beginning of the switch for 5 days because my stool smelled ""sour""? After that, normal and my farts don't smell.

What's also interesting is that despite the high fruit (whole food) intake, my Candida/Strep/Staph Aureus weren't higher. Candida was 2.65e4 with a threshold of 5e3, Staph 9.8e2 with a threshold of 5e2 and Strep was 6.8e3 with a threshold of 1e3. All in all, not too bad, Candida moderately elevated and the other two considered low. It's also noteworthy that after I completed the GI MAP test, I was working on fixing motility issues and actually saw pieces of undigested steak come out in the stool at which point the stool color changed from yellow to light brown. It has gotten progressively darker brown since then, as well as the fungal colonies/clusters have stopped coming out as well, all while maintaining high fruit intake. Apparently there is a correlation with high animal protein diets and these infections. 

Only other thing to note is that I had some less optimal levels of beneficial bacteria that I have been working on growing with my high dose prebiotic diet (100+g/day inulin/resistant starch/pectin/RFO), but most recently focusing on adding scFOS (short chain) foods. I also decided to take some probiotics proven to clear biofilms and infections in the small intestines (LGG+LP-115) which I'll continue for a few months for good measure and then continue with high dose prebiotics for another 3-6 months.

Love is more than just a feeling; it is a fxrce that binds souls together, a silent whisper between hearts that transcends time and space. It is in the stolen glances across a crowded room, the warmth of a hand intertwined with another, and the quiet comfort of knowing someone is always there.

True love is not found in grand gestures alone but in the little things-the way one person remembers how the other takes their coffee, the way they pull a blanket over them when they fall asleep, or how they listen to their dreams as if they were their own. It is in laughter that echoes through late-night conversations and the unspoken words that rest in the spaces between breaths.

Love is patient, enduring through storms and standing resilient against the winds of change. It is not perfect, but it does not need to be. It thrives in imperfections, in learning, in growing together. It is the courage to be vulnerable, to let someone see the depths of your soul, and to trust that they will cherish it.

Basically title. Two weeks ago we were on our latest date, normal coffee date, was great she seemed interested in going out more as this was only our third date so far, but we do text every day, not a huge amount but enough and play a lot of word hunt (game on imessage) together. 

A week ago her uncle died and she told me that after not responding to my text about going out again this week for a day. That's all fine, I told her that I am here for her if she needs anything or someone to talk and that I will give her some space. After that she still messaged me, albeit much slower until we went two days with like one message exchange. I took that as a sign to not bother her. I wanted to give her something small to cheer her up and got her a plushie and some sweets as thats something she likes and told her that I would like to bring her something to cheer her up, just for minute and that I wouldn't disturb her too long. She completely skipped the part about me bringing it to her and just said that I really didnt need to get her anything with the crying emoji (gen z stuff). Then she kept sending me word hunts.

Then after that its been two more days of basically nothing but occasional word hunt.

I have no clue how to interpret this, for a bit she seems fine and then its radio silence, but then she sends a game again and then disappears. I don't want our relationship to die out like this but I also don't want to impose stress on her by asking anything about our relationship. I also don't know how long to wait to ask her out again. I can have patience but I also don't want to wait forever just for the relationship to not go anywhere and keep stressing the whole time.

1jrjkvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1jrjkvx/new_and_in_need_for_improvement_tips/,New and in need for improvement tips,"Hey all. This is my first time writing about my anxiety in an actual forum dedicated to it, in hopes of self improving. I have seperation anxiety, health anxiety and just basic anxiety as it is (according to the state of day or weather, or where I am)
I'll have around 3 sections in this post, it being 
-when it started.
-how it affects me now.
-needing tips and advices. (Most important)
You can skip the first two, the most important for me is the last.

My story:
Im very embarassed to admit but I've been having anxiety problems for years now without actually considering reaching out for help, from people who know how it feels actually and what could help it. I only recently started practicing mental hygiene thanks to my girlfriend. 
Last year I had a huge burn out from school and family life, thanks to staying up until 1am to animate my project works, to going to the gym 3 times a week, doing a ,,diet,"" (diet on the weekends were like, drinking a coffee, going to the gym eating a chocolet bar, going home drinking an energy drink, eating a soup, and thats it.) keeping up a social life with friends and family, working on my passions, etc, etc. Suddenly, I had a mental break down out of nowhere. I had several panic attacks a week, I ruined my menstruation cycle from stress, and got a urinary tract infection. It as it was didn't make me too concerned, I took my antibiotics, and kept up my harmful habits. Then, I got a second one. I attempted to cure it myself, only to end up in great pain and a horrible kidney infection. My mistake was coming up on Reddit, reading horror stories about this infection, and I instantly became paranoid because of others stories. I tought I have reoccuring uti infections (I didn't actually, my body was at its lowest at that point and I very easily caught sicknesses and infections), and for straight months, even like half a year, I had constant anxiety attacks. Every single week. I wasnt 18 at that Time, and I couldnt reach out for a mental doctor. My friends and family watched me slowly decay myself into a not sleeping, eating mess. Their lack of support was kinda one of the reasons I went so low, but I dont blame them for being annoyed with me. In the summer I started slowly healing out from it, into just having obsessive behavior like, not drinking coffee or eating spicy food, drinking 4 liters of water to make sure Im never gonna catch anything. Still, when I needed to go to the toilet a bit more often or feeling the slightest sting while urinating had me in a deep spiral. Then, on my 18th birthday I decided that its time I put myself together because no one else will. 

Now: I started improving my life by doing selfcare, building my social circle, my looks and hobbies. I started getting better. I only had 1 attack a month that lasted for several days at a time. 
Then I started dating my girlfriend. That fact (she didn't know about this anxiety of mine) had me cured from it like in 2 months. I dont know how, but it just happened subconciussly. My mind became a lot less tense and I became free to live my life, atleast almost. I realised I still have anxieties and I want to be able to manage them without being reliant on my lover. I get health anxiety from lung infections, needing to take antibiotics, and yes, herpes now. I have a cold sore and I become insanely paranoid of possibly giving it to my girlfriend. Shes being very supportive about it, she does whatever I ask her to, like to go wash her face (I kissed her forehead with my almost completely healed sore (just a red spot above my lips, no open wound or anything, the skin is red like its being irritated) after I kiss her forehead, wash up before and after sex (Shes not taking this bed rule seriusly, I need to make her go) and to take my cranberry supplements after the do for 3 days. 

Seperation anxiety.
Well. Its hard to explain properly without seeming lame, but here we go. Whenever she goes offline while being with her friends, I get anxius. Is there a reason? No. I just do it, and I dont know why. It lasts for a few hours until it settles down.

Basic anxiety.
Well. Thats usually after an attack, or it might be a part of my days long attacks in its final, calm state. I get anxius when I get home. Yeah, there is no reason why its that way, but it is. I sit down in my room, (which is kinda dark, even with my three lamps on) and I immediatly get anxius. Usually going out from the house to go shopping with my parents, or exercise helps. The problem is, I have my final exams coming on, and I have to learn on my computer, which is hard while being anxius, in my room alone. 

I get anxius when the sun starts going down.
Once again, I dont know why its that way. Its not all the time though, only when im stressed.


Advices:
I decided I want to completely get better, for myself, for her and for my loved ones. I need good advices and practices when it comes to anxiety, like how to manage health anxiety, seperation anxiety and just anxiety in general. Breathing exercises are absolutely worthless in my case, once I start doing them I just end up hyperventilating. The 333 rule is kinda doing it but its not the best, sadly.

The lowdown is that I (29 M) started a new job about 7 weeks ago, shifting from working in the coffee industry to being a full time Landscaper/Groundworker. 

Now, I'm a pretty healthy, active person, maybe a little heavier than the average guy but I'm over 6'5 so I'm sure it evens out. However ever since I started this job I've been finding it pretty difficult to get back up after laying, sitting, kneeling or anything that basically requires me to go lower to the ground.

Maybe I'm being silly, but surely after 7 weeks of this kind of thing your body would adjust to the difference and settle in right? If anyone can weigh in on this situation that would be fantastic

i just bought the breville bambino plus. i’m very new to making espresso. i work at starbucks, but making espresso there is automatic.

i’ve been trying to dial in the coffee & find the right grind size to make a good espresso, but my espresso is coming out bitter & I don’t think i’m doing it right. i haven’t bought a grinder yet because i figured i’d just use the free beans i get from starbucks & grind it at work. first, i tried grinding it on the espresso setting to the finest setting in increments to test each grind size, but the espresso setting seemed to be too fine. (for reference, i’m pretty sure we have the Ditting KR1403 Commercial Coffee Grinder at work.) now i’m using our blonde espresso beans grinder at various coarser increments. anyways here’s the process im doing. let me know if something seems wrong

1) i used a scale in the kitchen (it’s not very accurate but i don’t want to buy extra tools yet) & weighed out 18g of coffee in the dual wall 2 cup basket in the portafilter (i used the dual wall because the starbucks beans don’t have a roasted on date & they’re probably pretty old.)
2) i tried my best to distribute the coffee with the north south east west thing using my fingers. i also tried getting rid of clumps with a toothpick before i distributed. (again i don’t want to buy extra tools yet until i get the basics & whatnot.)
3) i tamped it, but i’m worried that im not tamping it evenly. then i use the razor on top & usually it takes off a bit of coffee every time.
4) i put the portafilter into the group head. i didn’t know it would be so difficult to put it in; it’s very resistant, but i get it to the lock position.
5) i weigh the cup i’m using first then put it under so i can measure the output of coffee. i also get my stopwatch ready to time the shots. 

the espresso output always comes out to past 40g, sometimes in the 50’s. the first drops of espresso have been coming out at about 12s almost 13s & ending at about 31-32s. & the espresso comes out dark & bitter. this has happened with every grind size i’ve tested (i only tested from 1 to 6 grind size on the grinder at work).

if anyone can find what i’m doing wrong, please let me know. i’ve been very excited to make good coffee at home with the espresso machine, but it is more frustrating than i expected T.T",1,1743792257.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Alright, let's kick this off with a real talk. Raise your hand if you've ever dragged yourself out of bed at the crack of dawn because someone told you ""the early bird catches the worm."" 🙋‍♂️ Guilty? Yep, me too. But here’s the plot twist—I’m not actually a morning person. And guess what? That’s totally okay!

**Time Blocking vs. Energy Peaks**—it’s the battle royale nobody talks about enough. I was *that person* who tried every time-blocking technique in the book. Waking up early, scheduling my day down to the minute… I mean, why wouldn’t it work, right? Everyone swears by it! But, here's a secret: it didn't work for me. 

It took me a while to discover why I wasn't hitting my productivity goals. The real game-changer? Understanding my **energy peaks**. Turns out, I'm a night owl, and mornings are my worst enemy. 😴

So, here's the juicy part—how I shaved *10 hours* off my week by flipping the script:

- **Identify Your Energy Peaks**: Start by asking yourself, “When do I feel most alive and focused?” For me, it’s that sweet spot between 2 PM and 7 PM. Find yours.

- **Customize Your Time Blocking**: Instead of forcing myself to be a morning person, I adjusted my time blocks. ***Peak energy times?*** That’s when I tackle the tough stuff. Creative work, deep focus projects—you name it.

- **Embrace the Lulls**: If mornings make you feel like a zombie, use that time for easy tasks. Answering emails, planning your day, or even just relaxing with a coffee can set a positive tone without draining your energy. ☕

- **Flexibility is Key**: Life doesn’t always fit neatly into blocks. Be ready to adapt when those unexpected things pop up. It’s not about perfection; it’s about progress.

Ah, the beauty of working smarter, not harder! 🌟 Who knew that skipping mornings could actually be more productive?

So, fellow time travelers, what's your schedule hack? Have you found your energy peaks? Would love to hear how you train your productivity dragon! 🐉

I’ve only had 2 queer relationships - my first and my last. More than half my time having a (very public) queer identity I’ve been single and celibate. I had the benefit of coming out in a very queer city and community in the U.S. - but I’ve been very reserved with my energy and can be a bit spacey when it comes to flirting. I feel like people basically went from liking me to hating me because I wasn’t emotionally available or interested. I had a lot of stuff to work through. Both my partners I met on the apps (which I have no interest in rejoining) and neither was from the city I was in. Both of those were codependent and too fast. I’ve never dated more than one person at a time and have always been monogamous. Now I’m traveling solo around the world and the isolation is starting to get to me. 

I’m trying to figure out other ways to connect to queer community, especially in my demographic (over 40, POC) and not sure what to do. I’ve never been married and don’t have kids and I feel like people my age don’t relate to me. It feels like the options are apps or bars? I haven’t tried the bar thing but considering it.

Cities around the world that are known to be queer usually mean gay men, mostly rich white gay men. Same with gay bars. Hanging around coffee shops and queer neighborhoods doesn’t necessarily result in new friends or even conversations. I’m trying to figure out how to put myself out there and what that even means. THIS is my first Reddit post! 

Anyone know any good meet ups groups or sites that focus more on community and friendship and not just dating? I do want to date but I feel like the apps are shady and low vibrational. I’d love to meet someone in real life. Currently I’m in Manchester where I heard people are friendly but wondering if I should have picked London instead? Not sure if I’m going to stay in the UK because cost of living is wild. But I’m looking for a new place to call home and just needed to be around some English speakers for a while. I would be open to figuring out a more global online dating app that matched based on compatibility vs swiping? Do I just have to face my fear of being rejected (and of rejecting) and start going on a ton of dates? Is this anyone else’s experience? Do I need a match maker? Even if I picked some hobby class to attend - no guarantee they’ll be full of potential matches? I’ve heard Meetup tends to be more for professional networking and one off events.

Lac concept bath soap rose petals
Nourish of London Antioxidant multitasking superbalm sample which i can't wait to use up my excess skincare so I can buy one!
Sukin foaming facial cleanser 
Dermalogica circular hydration serum sample

Ever felt like the clock is your arch-nemesis?** 🤔 Like you're always racing against time and somehow always losing? I've been there. It’s like trying to match socks in the dark—frustratingly impossible. Recently, I stumbled upon a game-changer that helped me reclaim around 10 hours each week! And no, it’s not magic (though that would be cool). It's a combination of time blocking and energy peak scheduling. Stick with me, and let’s unpack this magic!

First off, **time blocking is like Tetris for your calendar.** You assign blocks of time for different tasks and get rid of the chaotic ping-ponging between activities. Sounds neat, right? But here’s a kicker—not all hours are created equal. That’s where **energy peaks** come in. We all have those golden hours of the day when we’re buzzing with focus and creativity like we’ve mainlined espresso. 🕺

**Here’s how I merged the duo for maximum efficiency:**

- **Identify Your Peaks:** Are you a morning person or does your brain click into gear in the afternoon? Do some detective work—track when you feel most energetic or productive during the day. Use this time for tasks that need maximum brainpower.

- **Time Block Like a Boss:** Once you know your energy peaks, time block your day around them. Slot in complex tasks during those high-energy periods. For me, it’s writing this post with my morning coffee when ideas just flow. ☕

- **Embrace Flexibility:** Life happens. Sometimes you’ve got to switch things around. But knowing your peaks means you can still manage to squeeze in that important task when you’re feeling sharp. Like doing a workout before a meeting. 💪

- **Purpose Over Perfection:** Don’t aim for a flawless schedule. Aim for one that aligns with when you’re at your best. It’s more about working smarter, not harder. Imagine spending less time on tasks and getting better results!

A little secret? Since I started combining these two strategies, I swear I've discovered an extra day in my week. Okay, maybe not literally, but you get the point. 😉

Ever tried this combo before? Or maybe you're rocking something different that works wonders? Feel free to share your own tips, embarrassments, and light bulb moments! Looking forward to hearing how you make the most out of *your* time.",1,1743791122.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

My husband and I relocating to Wichita in late May, as he will be starting a job at Spirit. We are in process of trying to find somewhere to live and I am wondering if anyone knows of a spot that ticks at least most of our boxes? Apologies if this has been asked a million times - I searched the threads but couldn't find anything that addressed some of our specific wants. 



We are absolutely open to renting a house and are keeping our eyes peeled, but we are hoping for some apartment options if we don't find a house that meets our needs in time.



Here's what we are after:



* **Budget**: $1,500
* **Pet Friendly**: We have a dog and cat and would love a dog run, even if it's small.
* **Basement or Interior Hallway for Tornado Reasons:** I have read about how tornado alley has moved NE and how we likely don't need to be worried but... we are. We have never lived anywhere with tornadoes and would feel more comfortable with a basement or interior hallway in the complex. Please feel free to roast me. 
* **Gym**
* **Trail/Path Access:** My dog and I like to run together and would love to be within a mile or so of somewhere to run where we aren't dodging cars.
* **Location:** We would love to be close to some restaurants, coffee shops, etc, but also understand that Wichita is pretty accessible and that nothing is all that far.

  
I know we are probably looking for a unicorn, but figured I would send out an all call before we give up hope. We have looked at River Vista (This was our top choice, but I am seeing a lot of negative reviews on Reddit) and The Avante (Con: It seems to be semi-secluded). Maybe those are our two best bets?

1jris01,https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1jris01/what_makes_a_city_feel_like_a_city/,What makes a city feel like a city?,"This is a strange topic but I've always wondered why some cities give such a ""city vibe"" while others feel boring and barren.

For example, when I traveled through China, I lived in a huge city with millions of people and high population density but it felt really boring and isolating because large parts of the city were these huge gated residential communities where each block is like half a mile to a mile long with a bunch of huge high-rise condo buildings in them. There's a few basic shops inside each community but when you're walking outside it feels really dystopian. You're just walking down giant straight boulevards with racing traffic on one side of you and a giant continuous wall on the other side.

Even in the downtown areas, you're dealing with a lot of really long blocks with giant structures and buildings. If you're not inside a building, you're walking like 5-10 minutes per block with nothing to do or see. Just cars on giant multilane roads. There's pockets of reprieve in the ""old"" areas of the city of course, but I just didn't get the same city vibes I get from far smaller cities.

Macau, on the other hand, was an amazingly fun city to visit. It's tiny, you can drive from one end to another within half an hour. It has around 600k population and the only major industry in town is casinos. But man, it feels vibrant and alive. The city is split into two by water. The Northern peninsula part is the old city. It has small but walkable sidewalks and is packed with small businesses and shops. Coffee shops/eateries all over the place, small squares and parks, dense shopping areas, a giant packed merchant street, and lots of old casinos. It's a ton of fun exploring this part of the city.

The Southern part of the city is an island that's made with partially reclaimed land. That's where all the new giant casinos are and there's a ""Strip"" similar to the Las Vegas strip. Some people don't like casinos but they definitely draw a huge crowd with a lot of activity. There's also an old town area right at the beginning of the ""strip"" and it's filled with restaurants shops etc. It's a really really fun area to be in.

I can't get over how enjoyable the place is even though I don't gamble. You can go to the casinos just to shop and eat. I think casinos do a good job of creating fun non-gambling experiences. There's people from all over the world there and it's one of the best places to people watch. The city is also a proper developed city with basic things like clean water, good infrastructure, building standards, etc so you don't need to worry about basic quality of life problems like in parts of Southeast Asia.

I'm raving about Macau here and it's probably one of the most underrated destinations in the world for Western nomads/travelers imo but I want to try to create a framework for what a proper ""city"" is. I never want to waste time and money staying in a place like that Chinese city again but at the same time I want to use this framework to find ""hidden gems"" that are cheap or small cities that still give authentic city vibes.

Here's what I have so far, and maybe this can help you guys find and analyze new spots as well:

1. Population connectedness is far more important than population size - The reason a city of millions can feel so isolating is because it's not organized in a way that promotes organic human interactions. You want to look for smaller city blocks over giant ones. Mixed use zoning over purely residential ones. Smaller roads over larger ones. Outdoor seating. Regular 3rd places. Small parks/squares. And NO WALLS.

2. Population diversity is more important than population size - This doesn't have to be diversity in the sense of nationality, religion, ethnicity, etc. This can mean diversity in the types of people and what they do in life. For example, SF has a lot going for it. Beautiful landscape, climate, incredibly rich, major sports teams like the Warriors, etc. But it's a little bit too tech focused. A lot of people complain about a monotony or sameness of the people there. Compare SF to NYC. NYC is the financial capital but it has tons of people in academia, tech, cultural and arts industries. Broadway shows, Rockettes, film production, fashion, etc. You can pursue just about anything in a place like NYC and you could meet 100 people and each is pursuing something different. Macau has tons of tourists. About 1 in 6 people you see there is a tourist from somewhere. I encounter far more diversity there than the Chinese city that has 10x the population.

3. 2 or more major commercial hubs - This is probably the most discrete differentiator between a town with a ""main street"" and a city. Having multiple hubs creates diversity of experiences and also this feeling of FOMO. This might be a purely psychological thing but having different hubs to decide between gives me a feeling of choice and freedom. The more distinct, extensive, and numerous these hubs are, the greater the city vibe. Having some physical (even if it's just pure distance) separation is also important imo. Macau is a great example. It has two major commercial hubs separated by water. You usually focus your activities on one side of the water or the other. The history and experiences of the two sides are very different even though geographically, they're just minutes apart. The city would feel much more monotonous if there were no separation and it's just one continuous hub imo. Hong Kong is also another great example. Beijing, which is one of the biggest cities in the world, suffers from having actual geographic separation. It has a lot of distinct economic hubs, but it's just a giant flat continuous landmass which takes away from a sense of exploration, adventure, and distinctiveness.

4. Anonymity - There's something about being able to blend and disappear in the background. You don't feel any social obligations to strangers, and you can always reinvent yourself without the presumptions of people who already know you. This isn't hard to achieve for digital nomads even in towns, but if you stay there long enough, you'll start to feel the loss of this anonymity.

5. Contrast - There's a lot of new Asian cities that were created out of nothing. These cities are just the result of a few decades of intensive construction using similar techniques, styles, and urban planning. When you visit these places, it feels stifling because everything looks and feels the same. I think the more contrast there is in a city, the better it becomes. So things like old architecture mixed with modern. Big structures mixed with small. Tall with short. Urban jungle mixed with nature. Flat land mixed with mountainous elevation. This is one of the reason why so many people love Hong Kong. It's a city with more contrast than any other major city in the world. It's a city where East meets West. Victory Bay surrounded by beautiful mountains. A bunch of islands leading to a peninsula that connects to the rest of China. Urban jungle next to actual jungle. Millions of people living next monkeys in their natural habitat. Buddhist temples and Disneyland. Ferries, planes, and a giant bridges. Etc.

6. Short streets - Maybe I'm just traumatized by those mega blocks in China but there's something about smaller streets that feels so much better than long continuous ones. A long street starts to feel like a huge wall even if there's gaps between the actual buildings. It's feels stifling. There's no freedom or choice when you walk down a long street, you just have to go from end to end. But when there's regular intersections and alleyways, you can choose different experiences. Even if you go to the same destination every day, you can take slightly different routes. The intersections also feel like ""breaks"". I think the best example to illustrate this effect is mid to upper Manhattan city blocks. The short ""streets"" feel a lot better to walk on than the long ""avenues"". When you're walking on short streets, you're stopping and going, making choices of turning or not. When you're walking down avenues, you're committing to a long continuous walk next to a giant wall of buildings that are normally inaccessible unless you have a reason to go in one.

7. Cultural and historical landmarks - These things give a soul/identity to a city. Even though most of us aren't actively engaging with these landmarks every day, we're still surrounded by the historical context the city exists in. This is why I feel an ""emptiness"" when I visit cities that are just a few decades old compared to ones that are hundreds of years old. The new cities feel artificial and lacks identity.

7. Basic City things - Public transit, walkability, etc. These are all things we know by now but there's a huge difference between a city that has a mass transit train system and one that doesn't. And there's a huge difference between a city with proper sidewalks and one without.

I hope this post can help some of you analyze your next destinations and I'd love to hear your thoughts and anything you'd add to this list. Not all cities feel like cities. A tiny place like Macau can easily outshine cities 10x as big.",4,1743790806.0,digitalnomad,1,0.75,False

I'm looking for new friends who like playing games. Currently playing alot of Diablo 4, so casually hanging out in that game would be awesome. I also play CS2, Trackmania, and many other games (down to try anything). Co-oping a campaign would be nice too, I'm thinking the new Sniper Elite game? I'd also love to try something new, like I've never played Fortnite for instance. Hopping back into Rocket League can be fun as well. Or something way out of my comfort zone. 

Bonus points if you're into music (psychedelic rock is my jam at the moment) and if you're closeby (I'm in The Netherlands) meeting up for a beer or coffee would be amazing, I'll try to beat you on pool or bowling or something.
