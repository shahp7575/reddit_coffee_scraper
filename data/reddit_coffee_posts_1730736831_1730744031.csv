Hej everyone!

Hope you are well today?
Let's get cozy 
Here, take a blanket 
Can I offer you a cup of tea or coffee?



Me:

- shy person, especially at the beginning 
- really likes animals, nature, rain, gaming, memes, coffee and tea
- chronically tired
- absolutely not the outgoing type 
- friendly, caring, sweet and affectionate 
- a safe person to talk to 


Gaming:

Overwatch, Guild Wars 2, MTG (teach me?), No Man's Sky, Fallout, Elder scrolls, Baldurs Gate 3, Ark Survival Evolved, Valheim
At the moment I'm mainly looking for Overwatch, especially in the beginning. 


(Mental) health is an important part of my life and I do understand how it feels to struggle. 
I'm a person who needs attention, who likes the feeling that someone cares - who doesn't?
As I mentioned above I am someone who truly cares about others and their wellbeing. So if I like you, then I'll definitely ask you often how you are. Are you tired or cold or maybe everything is alright? I'd like to hear it!



You:

- friendly and caring
- a bit different 
- okay with me being shy
- okay with chatting a bit first
- a bit older (30, 40, 50,...)
- from Europe 
- obsessed with Gaming

Got 2x Pfizer and 1x Pfizer booster in late 2021. Went to a show in San Francisco on Halloween where I think I got it. Symptoms began 11/3. I woke up feeling more groggy than usual with a low level feeling of malaise. I figured I slept weird (was out of town) or just needed some coffee. As time progressed I started to feel worse and worse (the coffee didn't help). One of my telltale signs that I'm getting sick is moving my eyes without moving my head and getting a weird dull dragging feeling behind my eyes, which I had. My throat felt a little rough but not enough to consider it sickness or even allergies.

Then I came down with chills. It was getting warmer and my girlfriend was removing layers and I kept adding them on. She had to drive us back home while I put 3 shirts, a sweat shirt, a down camping jacket and a regular jacket on and I was still freezing for a lot of the drive. She felt my skin and said I felt warm. When I arrived home, I got out of the car and felt all woozy, my head felt like it was under pressure, and I just felt bad - limbs heavy and achey. My legs and glutes felt especially achey and bad.

I took a shower, drank some tea, and my gf went to the store and got all sorts of immune support things for me which I took. My temperature came out to 100.5. At one point in the evening, it dropped to 96.9. I had barely eaten all day but ate a relatively big dinner of chicken soup, crackers, and bread. During the middle of the night, I began to feel freezing - I was shaking with chills and had to have many blankets piled on top of me to stay warm.

Today I feel a little better, head seems clearer. No coughing to speak of, some slight nasal congestion but pretty minimal. Not much of an appetite today but drinking lots of juice and tea. Took an instant test and the second line appeared immediately when I inserted the swab. It was a good run!",1,1730743464.0,COVID19positive,1,1.0,False
1gjkrnb,https://www.reddit.com/r/goosecreekcandles/comments/1gjkrnb/review_of_my_first_gc_order/,Review of my first GC Order!,"Hey everyone! So, I finally went through (almost) all the candles of my first Goose Creek purchase. It's a mix of their aromatherapy candles, and some others I was recommended to try as a GC newbie. Since I work from home, I light them all day long in the living room as I work, so I really got some quality time with them for this review. Disclaimer – I am not into gourmand, and super sweet scents are not really my thing. I can do sweet if it’s more delicate or if it’s balanced with something else. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:

**1. Eucalyptus Garland** \- This one is okay, it’s nice, but I could only really envision this scent in a bathroom. It reminded me of a hybrid between a nice and clean hotel bathroom and a fresh men’s cologne. I saw some people describe it as a spa scent, I can’t really see it. To me, spa is a luxurious aromatic, botanical, creamy scent. This one is very cool and crisp, very clean. While it’s fresh and does go well in a bathroom, I wouldn’t repurchase. It performed well, made my bathroom smell nice, but it’s too much like cologne/cleaning product hybrid for me.

**TL;DR -** Fresh, crisp, and clean, with a cologne-like vibe that’s great for bathrooms but feels too much like a cleaning product or cologne. **3/5**

 

**2. Autumn Fog** – this candle reminds me of a morning on a lake, with some trees and dew. Maybe I am influenced by the packaging but it’s very fitting to the vibe of this candle. It has a slight cologne feel too, which is not what I normally look for in candles, but despite that I enjoyed it a lot. It’s quite unique and pleasant. There is a slight tangy sweetness to it, probably from the mandarin, that makes it really inviting. It’s cozy in a cool, crisp kind of way. I like it for rainy, cloudy days.

**TL;DR -** Unique and cozy with a crisp, slightly tangy vibe that feels like a dewy morning on a lake. Great for rainy days. **4/5**

 

**3. Neroli & Citrus** – I love this candle. It does help that I love citrus scents. This is a bright citrus, but not in a toilet cleaning product kind of way. I used it in the living room where I work during the day, as it’s super pleasant and not too strong for this space (I’m looking at you, Coffee House). It’s clean and fresh, but in a zen, spa, very calming way. I can see spas using this scent. A spa weekend was the catalyst for me frantically searching for good quality candles to buy for my home. So, this one was an obvious choice, and it really did not disappoint. 

**TL;DR -** Bright, fresh, and calming, with a spa-like citrus scent that’s perfect for daytime use. **4.5/5**

 

**4. Bergamot & Tea Leaves** – I loved this from first, cold sniff. It took a couple of days for me to really grasp this candle when lit, but it’s so lovely. It’s strong and fills up the space – this is another one I could smell from outside my apartment door. But, unlike Coffee House, this one never got too much for me. I can envision this scent at a spa as well. I still feel like I haven’t discovered my ‘perfect’ spa-like candle, this one and Neroli & Citrus are both so lovely.

**TL;DR -** Lovely, strong, and space-filling without being overwhelming. **4.5/5**

 

**5. Staying Home** – This candle is another one I really enjoyed, I specifically used it in the bedroom. It’s very warm and cozy, I can see it used in any room really. It’s really a “home” scent, the name is so perfect for it now that I think about it. It’s like a signature scent for a home. Good for all moods and seasons and performed well. Not super strong or overpowering, just so nice, inviting and comforting. To me it’s very nicely balanced that there is not one note overpowering the others, they’re all very smoothly blended. I loved using in the evening after a shower, when I lay in bed before going to sleep.

**TL;DR** \- Warm, inviting, and balanced. Perfect for all rooms and feels like a true “home” scent, especially cozy in the evening. **4.6/5**

 

**6. Coffee House** – I spent way too much time thinking about this candle. I thought this candle would be one of my favorites, as there were so many recommendations, and the description of a Coffee House smell sounded so promising. At first, I was very impressed with it. It’s so strong. As soon as I unboxed my order, I lit this candle and went outside my building to discard the box. I returned to my apartment, and before I could even reach for the door handle, I could smell the sweet coffee. An hour later when I came back from errands, I could smell it from a few meters away outside the apartment. A few days later, I kid you not, I could smell it from OUTSIDE THE BUILDING. And we live on one of the top floors. Funny story, my boyfriend works from the office (with the door closed), at the other end of the apartment. I had to go somewhere and left Coffee House on the dining room table, this is the first time I ever lit it. My boyfriend said he left his meeting in a panic because he thought I forgot the coffee pot on the stove and that it was burning. He hates this candle by the way. In his words – “I love Neroli & Citrus just as much as I hate Coffee House” and “let’s put it in the bathroom, at least it smells better than shit”.  We could not finish this candle because my boyfriend said it’s too strong and cloying and makes him nauseous. In my opinion Coffee House is not bad, it’s just very strong and sweet, and it’s more like a coffee dessert scent than a realistic Coffee House scent to me. So, it’s not so usable for me. After a while it can get too much. I think I would have liked it much better if there were some woody and/or musky notes to balance all the coffee chocolaty milky sweetness. Also, my apartment is not a huge space, and this candle overwhelmed it a little. Would not repurchase this one.

**TL;DR** \- boyfriend hated it, I’m okay with it in small doses when I’m in the right mood for it. Too dessert-like rather than a realistic Coffee House. **2.5/5**

 

**7. Warm & Welcome –** If I had to repurchase only one candle out of this list, it would be Warm & Welcome. It’s amazing. Despite being adamant on my house smelling like a spa when making this purchase, this candle changed my mind. Yes the aromatherapy candles are great, the freshness is great, but this is just addictive. Actually, if I had to use one word to desrcibe this candle, I would choose “addictive”. I didn’t want to finish it up. The other candles, even the ones I really enjoyed, I went through them looking forward to the next Goose Creek candles I want to try. But this one I want to savor. The sweetness is so delicate, not too cloying or heavy. It can see myself using it all year round because it's light and soft enough for warmer weather, and it’s so cozy and comforting for winter and autumn. If this had a coffee note, it’s what I would have wanted Coffee House to smell like. It’s so pleasant. The vanilla, white mocha, marshmallow and wood notes are perfect together. It slowly fills the room and is never too much, but it’s also not too weak by any means. By the way, I also ordered the Warm & Welcome room spray, I love it!

**TL;DR** \- My favorite. Cozy, soft, and delicate with vanilla, white mocha, marshmallow and creamy wood notes that are addictive and perfect year-round. **10/5**",2,1730743402.0,goosecreekcandles,0,0.75,False

From the moment I awaken, I am consumed by the unstoppable pull of my addiction. With shaking hands, I grab my phone and log in to the online casino, seeking relief in this digital empire of false promises and fleeting highs.

As I finish my morning coffee, I find myself lost in desperation and despair, chasing that big win, while drowning in the depths of guilt, anxiety, and shame. I can't breath and it’s time to go to work. As I walk, I browse through loan provider websites, planning what to lie this time and where to get some more money to found my daily pursuit of “happiness”.

Istart my “work”, I log in to an online casino on my phone, depositing all my money I have left and setting up auto spins. I place the phone within sight so I can constantly watch the ongoing hell of my life. The money ran out, I have to make a bit of effort to secure new financing.

After work, I am so happy and excited by the fact that my partner going to be on the evening shift: that meant a free game night. I could lay down on the couch, chill out, and revel in gaming. No need to suffer from “stomach issues” all night and sneak into the bathroom with my phone.

With each bet, I am drawn deeper into my bubble world.  In the dim glow of the screen, I lose myself in a maze of flashing lights and spinning reels, chasing the that one big win which seems to be always slightly out of reach.

With each loss, I am reminded that my addiction has taken on my life, my relationships shattered, my dreams broken. And yet still I tap the screen, unable to stop.

As the day wears on, the weight of my addiction grows ever heavier, anxiety is too heavy to bear alone.I throw up. In bed Im terrified. My mind is consumed with thoughts of fear, discuss, shame, anxiety, guilt. There is no way out I want to die. Ifell asleep. In my dreams my only companions are the ghosts of my past and the demons of my present…

When we moved in, all of us had to have a meeting with the RA in person going over what we are comfortable with and at what level. (ex. are you comfortable sharing spices? answers can be yes, yes with permission, no). I stated that I am unconformable sharing any of my stuff without explicit permission. we all signed the document and agreed.. and what do you know, paper towels, dish soap, baby wipes, coffee syrup, and toilet paper are all being used up. I sent two every explicit text bursts that restated the housing agreement and that I do not want anyone using my things without permission.

*\[Retrieving log of holopad ID “A.SCHEELE01”\]*

*\[Timestamped 2136-12-23 08:33:03 UTC\]*

*\[Transcribing most recent video, titled “Leirn: A brief study on the virtuous process of an uplift”, published 2135-11-05\]*

The video opens with a shot of the void of space and slowly pans up to a planet: Leirn. Inspiring music fades in as the organization’s name and logo appears on screen: directly translates from Farsul script to “History the Right Way”. A smooth-voiced Kolshian narrator speaks.

Narrator:\* Leirn: The planet of one of the Federation’s most recent—and proudest—uplifts to date. It is a fine example of the vast benefits the Federation so selflessly brings to a primitive society.\*

The image is blurred by a quick zoom through space and atmosphere into one of the planet’s landmasses, transitioning into a new scene focused on a group of Yotul working around a mechanical machine with gears and levers. They appear wary of the camera, but continue moving about regardless. The music shifts from the high, inspiring notes to something far more clunky and almost childish.

Narrator: *And here we see the Yotul. A humble species, once nothing more than brutes clinging to the edge of survival, blessed with just enough ingenuity to make simple machines and make do on their predator-ridden planet. Here we see an archaic device they so crudely formulated: a printing press. This amalgam of wheels and levers serves the purpose of large-scale printing of physical newspapers—something so plainly useless to a modern society.*

The scene fades to a line of Yotul workers folding the newspapers tight, tying them off with a string, then depositing them into a sack.

Narrator: \*Their intellectual capacity was… well, let’s call it limited. Toying with useless machines, attempting to solve problems that had long-since been perfected by the Federation. And even more, they had yet to eradicate the fearsome predators native to their planet, even deigning to live side by side with them! \*

A still black-and-white image suddenly appears overlaid on the previous shot, combined with a boom sound effect to punctuate the severity of the image. It is of a Yotul and a smaller quadruped known as a hensa. The hensa is sitting by the Yotul’s side, but its eyes are censored with a black bar.

Narrator: *To anyone else, the poor Yotul would’ve seemed like all but a lost cause. But we, in our infinite wisdom, saw potential. No prey should have to live like this: isolated and at the whims of predators. It’s the duty for a moral, superior species to spare these poor primitives a futile existence.*

The clunky whistles and percussion fade back in as a montage of short, black-and-white shots of various buildings and infrastructure is shown. Among the images are town buildings, campuses, factories, and railroads.

Narrator: *But we—advanced, benevolent—took it upon ourselves to raise them from the mire.*

The montage switches to colored shots while the music shifts to energetic synths and strings, focusing on newly built infrastructure and buildings. They are all common designs and architecture seen across Federation worlds, looking nothing like the black-and-white images that came before.

Narrator: *Their first encounters with technology, with tools they could never dream of forging on their own, left them in awe.*

The montage cuts to a Yotul operating a computer alongside a Kolshian. They appear disinterested in the computer screen. It gradually cuts to other scenes involving Yotul, some operating machinery, some riding in a vehicle, and a shot of one standing behind a podium, giving a speech.

Narrator: *Of course, there are growing pains. They resist at times, clinging to their old ways—superstitious and crude customs deriving from their nonsensical and unscientific belief systems. The predators on their world have done a number on their outlook and receptiveness to the uplift process. But patience is key. We coax them along, gently but firmly.*

The documentary abruptly cuts to a wall of flames being spewed by Gojid in a reflective exterminator suit, directed at something off-screen. Heroic music erupts. The flames fade into another shot of the same Gojid with their mask off, proudly showing off their flamethrower to the camera.

Narrator: *With our guidance, we brought them to a state of competence. It is our nature as empathetic prey to see the best in each other and help, no matter how dire the situation. We lift the weak. Raise them up from the shadows of ignorance. Burn away their problems.*

As the narrator speaks, several more exterminators of various species heroically emerge from the plumes of smoke behind the Gojid. Once seven are all in a line, the camera slowly pans up to a bright sky. Several ships hover overhead as the heroic music picks up.

Narrator: *We’ve given them so much. Today, they owe their existence as a civilized species to us. And in the future, who knows? Perhaps they could be the ones aiding another species that are as helpless as they once were.*

The camera continues to pan up, slowly transitioning into a night sky as the music reaches a crescendo before it fades away with tones of hopefulness.

Narrator: *But let’s be honest… they’re still a long way from greatness. The wheels of progress are slow to turn. But, for now, they are on the right track. And we should all be thankful to our founders for providing this gift to not only the Yotul, but many others across the galactic arm. The Yotul are an exemplary example of what the goodwill of the Federation can bring.*

The stars fade out with the music, and the video ends.

My first time consuming a piece of Federation media was a serious contender for the worst thing I’d ever seen.

There came a point where I couldn’t procrastinate any further. Celso was starting this paw, which meant that I couldn’t hold off on doing my research. Even then, I still chose a quick video because I was somehow still so stupidly ignorant of how horrible the galaxy really was.

Bemlin had once mentioned to me *The Exterminators* as a popular show to watch. The title alone made me hesitant, and I decided that fictional media procured within the Federation would be best left as loose expectations in my head. Maybe I’d been subconsciously avoiding any kind of their informational videos for the same reason.

However, video is one of the most information-dense forms of media. Very few mediums can come close to the level of detail you can include in a moving image with voice-over and the level of engagement you can procure from it. Engagement is usually the hardest thing to achieve, especially with academic papers packing information denser than a tungsten cube.

In the case of this… “documentary” that I found, it was certainly *dense*. I thought it’d be a quick way to do some Leirn learning and catch myself up. Well, it *did* do that, but in the worst possible way. Put succinctly, I watched about fifteen unadulterated minutes of propagandized racism and supremacism. And this was just one video. There were *hundreds* of results less popular than this one.

I didn’t like that the Federation didn’t particularly care for “primitive” history. I hated learning about how they disgraced their planet by tearing down their “outdated” developments like universities and mines and even railroads, replacing them with stupid Federation designs. And I was absolutely outraged when I realized that they were actively destroying things that amounted to entire *fields* of knowledge.

And it was all done by this band of colonial dog squids with no thought given for consent or mutuality. All in a few short years.

I felt so, so incredibly bad for the Yotul. I knew it went beyond just a single planet. Venlil Prime, the Cradle, Sillis, Khoa, *all of them*. Leirn just happened to be the latest victim of the Federation’s conga line of doom.

How did Celso deal with this? I caught myself repeating what I said in his interviews over and over again. Did I come across as just another racist alien to him? Or, even worse, was he so used to it that he just stuffed it away without a second thought? Whether I wanted to or not, I wasn’t sure I’d be able to see him the same way.

And his degree. His *five year master’s* degree. That “accredited” school that was up to “Federation standards” now had *very* dubious connotations. I didn’t want to imagine what he’d gone through. I felt like I owed him a whole other interview (and then some) with what I now knew.

The end card of the “documentary” disappeared from my holopad’s screen as it went dark, entering power-saving mode. I’d been staring at it for that long. My reflection was angrily glaring at me, and I realized I should probably take a deep breath.

My research didn’t end there, even if it made me late for work. I didn’t care much for punctuality when the deep hole of stupid, *stupid* ignorance needed to be filled. I searched and searched for any information I could find. UN-made pamphlets, blog posts, news headlines, anything at all. My self-made crash course on Leirn went through all the most important (and therefore most terrible) things.

There was so much. Too much. I hated it all, and hated myself even more for being so stupidly naive. *Because it’s a damn mistake to believe that anything can simply be good. I should’ve learned my lesson after hearing the entire galaxy feared us, after the extermination fleet came, after everything. Why did I ever accept this stupid job offer?*

I supposed the single positive thing I learned was that the newly founded “Technocracy” managed to tear the Federation’s leech off their neck. If only after twenty long years of terrible, terrible subjugation.

I arrived at the facility, and hid what I imagined was a very grumpy face behind my mask. My aching lower back and the lack of coffee was absolutely not helping this morning.

I did my best to ignore the receptionists, but apparently that wasn’t who I should’ve been worried about. In the lobby, a Venlil that had been sitting down perked his head up when I entered. I barely made it a few steps inside when he approached me.

“Doctor Scheele?” he began. “I’d begun to worry you weren’t going to show up this claw.”

“Okay. Who are you?” I said, my voice laced with residual annoyance that I didn’t bother to control.

His spotted ears anxiously danced. “I’m Rosim. I don’t think we’ve formally met.” He stuck out his paw.

I ignored the gesture, choosing instead to keep walking towards the elevator. “Nice to meet you.”

He followed me, dropping his paw. “R-Right, um… I’ve been made aware that humans usually prefer to not wear a mask. I, um, would like to make it clear that I am comfortable with any decision that you wish to make.”

I rolled my eyes. “It’ll stay on. Did you need something?”

He seemed to shrink. “Y-Yes, actually. I’m one of the lead scientists working on the gene modifications study. M-More specifically, the Gojids.”

“Yeah, I’m running a little late right now. Could you try this again later?” I pressed the button to call the elevator.

“Well, actually, I’m afraid this is the first time I’ve seen you. With your long schedule, our shifts slide out of phase. Um, to the point, Doctor Su informed the research board, and hence me, that you had new information pertinent to the modifications study.”

“That sounds familiar. You work on the second floor, right?”

“Yes, along with everyone else. Er, *most* everyone, it seems. I’ve, um, sent you a few earlier emails requesting that you come to meet with us.”

I stepped into the elevator and pressed the button for the third floor. “Sorry, my inbox is flooded with about a hundred emails a day.” *If only I was exaggerating.*

Rosim followed me, flustered. “Regardless, I-I was hoping that you could keep us informed of any insights you might find? Er, that isn’t to say we aren’t making progress, but, um, I just mean to say that an extra head might help elucidate some things.”

“Didn’t Su say anything when she informed the research board?”

“Her information came in passing, like she already expected that we knew what Bemlin discovered. She seemed very busy last paw.”

“We only found it yesterday, and it isn’t even anything concrete.”

“O-Of course, but the research board is, um, slightly peeved that it was found out second handedly.”

The elevator doors opened at long last. “Do they want me to work even longer shifts just to keep them up to speed?”

I could see the orange beneath his spotted gray fur. “I d-didn’t mean—”

“I’m sure you didn’t. How about I get back to you about this? Sound good?”

“I, um, it would be better if—”

But I was already walking down the hallway. I was not in the mood for some impatient researchers. That damned insult of a video left the worst taste in my mouth and it was refusing to go away.

I opened the door to my office, and immediately frowned. I did a double-take at the room number, disbelieving that this was my office. It certainly didn’t have a cozy orange glow when I left last paw. I took a cautious few steps inside, slowly taking off my mask and setting it on my desk to get a clear look.

Inexplicably, there were Christmas lights placed along the top corners of the room, leading into a sagging zig-zag down one of the walls until the string ran out of lights. It was surprising enough that there were Christmas lights on this planet, but the story of how they ended up in my office was something I was far more interested in.

“Do you like it?” asked Bemlin from somewhere behind me, startling me. I whirled around, only to be greeted by the horrible image of a Gojid bathed in an orange glow—from the wall of flames he was proudly spewing.

I took a deep breath, trying for the hundredth time to erase that video from memory. Bemlin did seem proud, but for another reason.

“Um. Hey,” I said.

Either he saw my grouchy face or detected my tone of voice, because he took on a concerned look. “Are you… doing well?”

I took another deep breath. “I’m fine.”

“Are you sure?”

“Nope.”

His expression faltered. “What is it?”

And the final reason I hated that stupid video was because I learned that my friend had said some casually racist things the times we spoke about the Yotul that I hadn’t caught because I was ignorant.

“Bemlin, we need to talk,” I said.

His eyes filled with worry. “Are… Are the Christmas lights not acceptable? I didn’t mean any harm.”

“No, they’re—”

My thought was cut off by a certain pair of fox-like ears emerging from behind Bemlin’s spines. I was half-expecting Celso to show up late again, as so far his appearances here seemed chaotic. I should’ve been much happier to see him.

The Yotul waved a paw. “Hi. I showed up early this time!”

“And he helped place the lights,” Bemlin added. “But I can take them down if they do not have the effect I expected.”

“No, they’re… Celso, would you mind waiting outside?”

“No problem!” The Yotul backed out of the room. Bemlin’s worried expression only intensified as I closed the door.

“Bemlin, you…” I faltered, indecisive of how I wanted to approach this. I heaved a great sigh. “This is not how I wanted to start my morning.”

“Are the lights acceptable?”

I waved an absent hand, trying to think of how to talk about a topic I was absolutely not prepared to talk about. I must have taken too long to think, because Bemlin spoke first.

“Did I do something wrong?”

“Well, yes, but—”

“I did not mean any offense with the lights. I apologize.”

“Bemlin, I really don’t care about the lights,” I snapped. “When we were talking about…”

My voice died out as I realized what I just said. The worry in Bemlin’s eyes vanished, and he betrayed no emotion other than stiffening slightly. I’m sure anyone else would’ve missed it. He was very successfully trying to be inscrutable and stoic, but I knew better.

I pressed my hands to my eyes and rubbed, taking in a deep and slow breath. Talking to Bemlin about it could wait. It really shouldn’t, but it could. They seemed friendly with each other. And I couldn’t *entirely* blame him for going along with the systematic racism that he’d been a part of for all his life (though he absolutely had to be blamed to some extent). I didn’t want to be upset with him right after his show of kindness.

I let out the breath that had been building. “That came out wrong. Can we start over?”

“You are stressed.” His voice was steady, but I knew Bemlin.

“Yes. I appreciate the time and effort you put into the Christmas lights. It simply, uh, came at a bad time, I guess.”

He gauged me with steady eyes. A look I’d seen several times before. “What is on your mind?”

“You know, the only thing I was hoping for with our first FTL tests were some scattered microbial life. I mean, even some traces of catalytic precursors would’ve been insane. Just something to feed our theories on the origin of life. That was all I was hoping for.”

“You have told me that before. I am beginning to detect a pattern as to *when* you bring up this topic.”

“I don’t suppose you want me to go on about the emergence of mitochondria? It wasn’t an amoeba, by the way.” I sadly chuckled, then sighed. “Don’t worry about me. I’m fine. I’m just having my weekly fit about how much I hate the Federation. This time it’s about the amount of history and culture lost on every single planet and every single species.”

“I see.” His gaze dipped down.

“Yeah, it’s annoying.”

We stood in silence for a long moment. I took the opportunity to fully recognize what Bemlin had done with the lights, how the mood in my workspace changed from a bleak and sterile office to something that felt at least a little more like home.

“But who cares?” I said, forcing some gusto into my voice. “I’m inexplicably feeling festive. I really love the surprise! Did you order them all the way from Earth?”

He waved a dismissive claw. “No. A human store.”

I snorted. The existence of those stores on this planet was great, but unambiguously calling them a “human store” had some kind of special charm to it. “Of course you did. I should’ve guessed what your ‘research’ was about. How long did you have this in mind?”

“Several paws ago. I entered one of them out of curiosity, and the idea struck me.”

“You plotting Gojid. You showed up early, the last shift before our break, and had the new hire help you just for this? I didn’t think I was worth that kind of effort.”

“You should not speak about yourself in such a way,” said the Gojid, with just a bit more enthusiasm.

I pursed my lips. Apologies were always hard. “Right. I, uh, guess I need to watch what I say before I say it. Um, especially to my friends.”

“I believe it harms you more than it does me.” He met my gaze. I felt a small weight lift from my shoulders, lasting for just a moment. “What did you need to discuss with me?”

I shook my head. “It can wait for later. We should get to work. Thank you, really. The lights are a great first decoration. I just need some corny posters or something.”

“I hope they are acceptable.”

“Definitely acceptable,” I said, deeming the conversation over and reaching for my mask… *Reaching for my mask? Did I have that off while Celso was around?*

I winced, realizing I’d have to talk to Celso about everything, too. Or would that make things awkward? I had no idea. Perhaps the best way forward would be to continue treating him like a normal person—as if that were some radical thought.

I decided I’d deal with things if and when they popped up. Not like I’d done anything different in the past few months. I slipped my mask on and followed Bemlin out of my office.

Hey! Was a bit longer than usual for this one. Essentially, my life has been nothing but gas for the past month. And, unfortunately, it’s probably gonna stay that way until at least December. I can feel myself teetering on the edge of burnout, and I worry that it will spill into other things, like writing.

All that to say I still love writing and that things might just be a bit slower for a while (how many times have you heard that before?). Anyways, this endnote is already way too long, so here’s the credits.

Here’s a quick rundown of what to consider when amp shopping:

1. **Power & Volume**: You don't want to blast your tunes at 100W when you're just jamming in your bedroom! 🛏️ Consider wattages from 1W for headphone practice to 40W for small sessions with friends.

2. **Speaker Size**: Bigger = better low-end, but smaller is more portable! Think about your sound preference AND how many awkward stairs you have to climb. 🏋️‍♂️

3. **Tone Controls**: You want easy-to-use EQ controls. Two channels are great for switching between crunch and clean! 🎚️

4. **Effects**: Built-in effects like reverb and distortion can spice things up! 🎤 Don’t forget to check if you can save your favorite settings—because who wants to make that sound EVERY time from scratch?

5. **Connectivity**: Headphone jacks are a must if you don’t want your roommates plotting against your guitar skills! 🎧 Also look for aux inputs to strut your karaoke stuff.

6. **Sound Type**: Vintage tube amps offer that ‘classic rock’ feel, while modern digital amps give you a buffet of options! 🥳 Head to your local shop and try both! 

7. **Combo vs. Separates**: Combo amps are portable and practical, while separates are for those who fancy a more customized rig. But be careful—don’t end up like that guy who brings a full stack to the coffee shop! ☕🤣

Check your budget too! New amps come with warranties while going used can save you some dough (but inspect carefully!). And remember, the best practice amp is one that inspires you to play! 🎸✨ Happy jamming!

No matter how many platforms I used and explained to people, it seems no one has hear of it... So I'm turning to Reddit as my last option.

The game is a life simulator game where I own a house and a car. It is set in a town and the game had NPCs as well as other live players who can join. I drive my car to work and around town. It has job options like working in a restaurant but the main jobs were outdoor food stands where they had either a coffee stand or a hotdog stand (those are the 2 stands I remember). 
The stands operated on shifts and had a maximum number of working per shift. Other live players could join the game and work in those shifts, so if I was late I'd have to wait for the next shift.i couldn't talk to the other live players but I could work with them on shifts. I remember on the cafe shifts, NPCs or other players would come in, sit at a table order a coffee and sandwich. I would then go off to stand to the side to get the orders. In order to complete the order I'd have to play a mini game where there's a wheel that spins and I have to wait for it to point at the order I want the clock the wheel on time. At the end of each shift we got paid according to how many people we served and how many orders we got right.
The restaurant was owned by an NPC of an old man who would give daily tasks such as collection fruits or animals. The fruits were collected at a campsite where I had to drive to, park my car outside a gate and walk into the campsite to look for brushes that had berries on them. The animals were caught near the restaurant at a park or at a sandy place. To catch the animals I had to feed them, wait for them to trust me before getting closer to them. Sometimes I'd he successful and sometimes I'd fail. 

The only close response I've been given was ""My Sims(2007)"" and even though it's similar it's not the game I'm talking about. It was a mobile game that I played years ago. Not older than 2015 maybe.

They have been verbally abusive towards me for years in many situations (regardless of my sexual orientation) and I finally had enough. Normally, I just ignore their remarks and go about my day but I don't want to do that anymore.

Our last in-person interaction was the last straw that broke the camel's back:

They came home in August to visit our father (66M). (They live in Germany.)

I went home too, mostly to help my dad (mom died over a year ago and he gets a little lost what to cook as my SIL is extremely picky) and to be with my niece who was 5 months old at the time. (To clarify: I live 50 km/31 miles away and would travel back and forth every day because I can't leave my disabled cat for too long.)

When I arrived, I sat down to eat a few bites for breakfast.

My brother, SIL and my godmother (50F - she knows I'm gay but not supportive, just ignores it) sat around me at the table and stared at my coffee thermos which had a few small rainbow letters near the bottom.

Then they proceeded to discuss how unsightly it was to see gay people be affectionate in public in Barcelona (my godparents went there on holiday), how disgusting it all was and they should be fined on the spot by the police for PDA (which was just kissing, hugging, holding hands, etc). They did not understand why the government was allowing such things.



After a while, I had enough and just stood up silently and went outside to ask my dad what to help with. He sent me back in with some instructions.

That's when SIL and godmother saw that I was very upset and proceeded to ask what was wrong. I told them in a pissed-off manner to go ahead and think about their shitty behaviour and leave me alone.

I did raise my voice a bit and looked angry af, but I wasn't yelling.

They treated me like I was at fault for being upset over ""something that small"" and they think that ""normal"" people's PDA was not okay either, they just mentioned the gays first (?). My godmother was genuinely surprised and said that she ""didn't know this was an upsetting topic"" for me. Like hating on the community I belong to should make me joyful or what? I was entirely lost by this point.

I was the butt of the family for ""overreacting"". I wanted to leave but I was missing my niece a lot so I stayed.

After that day, I only cared about my niece and father and just ignored them as best I could, only interacting with them when absolutely necessary.

Then they doubled down on their shitty behaviour and treated my dad as an idiot for days. It got to a point, where my sweet, docile and doormat of a dad just stopped talking for over 2 days (till they left), only talking to them when no other option remained.



After about a week, they went back to Germany and I tried being civil with them, occasionally talking on Messenger but I just couldn't do it anymore.

I stopped talking to them and pulled away. As always, my dad continued as normal, because he does not want to lose his only grandkid (my niece) and he is way too naïve and forgiving with family.



This November, my brother and SIL invited me and my dad to Germany to spend some time together but I politely declined.

I told them I cannot leave my disabled cat without proper care (It wouldn't be impossible to arrange some care but he is very sensitive and old and I don't want him to get sick again).

My dad knows the real reason I don't want to go and says I need to be the bigger person, suck it up and just go (just the way I did for the last couple of years). He is willing to put things aside to see my niece.

Brother and SIL are also parading around in the family telling people I'm not willing to go.

I had family members interrogate me about the whole situation and I often get condescending looks from them when I mention my cat (I'm not out to the whole family as they are far too conservative and I do not want to risk it). I guess they think I'm a stupid lonely cat lady and don't understand the whole thing.

Also, my SIL is an expert at spinning stories to benefit them. Back when my mother became sick and I was left alone to care for her (dad was a truck driver, only came home for 2 days every 2 weeks), the whole family thought I was not doing enough. When my brother travelled home and just sat beside her bed and occasionally held her hand for a few days (did not change her diaper, did not bathe her, feed her, etc.), he was the hero of the family.



I'm at a point where I want to cut ties with my brother and SIL but I'm struggling because I know it would devastate my dad (the only person who truly loves and supports me) and I also love my niece to bits and want to be there for her when her idiot parents don't accept her in case she does not live up to their expectations.

I also know that it would be a futile attempt to talk things through with them as I've already tried that with different topics but they seem to lack the emotional intelligence and empathy to understand stuff that do not fit into their world.



*What should I do? How should I treat this situation? I don't want to cut ties with the whole family, I'm just tired of putting up with years of bs.*

*Please help. Thank you.*

(P.S. English is not my first language so please let me know if I explained stuff poorly.)

Have tried a few coffees now and 90 seems to drawdown in about 2m20s, with 95 being about 2m for the few coffees I've tried.

Still trying to figure out taste-wise if I need to grind finer or coarser but I'm think I can't really go any coarser because 2 minutes already seems like a pretty fast drawdown speed

Wondering what other folks get as their drawdown times at these clicks on the K6, and since this is will largely be due to water quality I had a quick Google search and this is (supposedly) the tap water quality in my area, which I then run through just a fairly standard Brita filter:

I've been working a lot lately, my father just died, and I'm not in the best place mentally. 

So I finally found what my boyfriend needed and I went to his place to deliver it to him I was expecting to be congratulated by him and even get some cuddles and a good night's sleep.

But when I go to his place he's not even there!! I thought he was waiting for me! but then I heard somewhere that he's in some shady bar near my place and he didn't even think of visiting me!! so I swallow my pride and I go to the bar, it is important work after all what we're doing, so I deliver the materials to him and not even a thank you?!! he's he usual pompous condescending self and not even a congratulation.

  
The worst thing of all he then goes and called me hideous and that I needed some beauty sleep, I'm exhausted that's true but that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt hearing it from him, and I thought he would offer me his bed to have a lie in but NO!! he just tells me to go to sleep that I'm ugly and that's it.

  
So I try not to get my feelings hurt maybe I need to polish myself a little so I go to my place take a shot of morphine (Don't ask!!) and sleep for like 2 hours there's so much to do I can't even sleep more I drink some coffee and I go to his place.

  
The first thing I see is his side bitch there (she owns the house but that's another story) And on top of all she looks a bit under the weather, and I'm like what wtf?! why the guy is a bachelor of medicine he can't take care of the people living in the same house as him? So I take pity on the poor girl and I give her some pick-me-up to help her recover.

  
I go up to his room and he has the worst attitude after all my hard work he just dismisses my findings and does not even offer me to sleep in his bed..  
Any advice is appreciated he doesn't know we're dating yet but he'll know for sure soon.

It's not only frustrating but demoralizing.

I was confident at the start she liked me back, because of her mannerisms. But after hanging out with other Japanese transfers I'm not so sure. The other Japanese girls have done things like put stickers on my cheek, poke my cheek, or jokingly offer for me to sit in their lap; these examples are far more forward than my crush btw. Also, they have boyfriends from back home; literally as their lock screen.

My crush will spend 2-3 hours with me, drinking coffee and studying English / Japanese interchangeably, and that has been the best thing for studying and is really heartwarming to me. We watch movies with friends; but never by ourselves. Sometimes she gives me all the attention I could ever wish, and then she ghosts me for a week to go out with friends for Halloween.

As Dan said when asked what people can do on Election Day itself:

“You can absolutely volunteer on Election Day. It’s one of the most important volunteer days out there, because the campaigns are gonna have a list of who their target voters are and they know— they have people at the precincts getting updated voter rolls— who voted. So they have people calling the people who have not yet voted. 

We may need people who can drive people to the polls. There’s all kind of things you can do on Election Day. From phone banking to driving people to the polls to being a poll watcher or working for the campaign on that day to just helping out in the office to do administrative work or get coffee and donuts or whatever for the people working that day, there’s so much you can do.

So I would check with your local campaign or local party or go to Vote Save America to look for opportunities.”

My unit had sent me to the airport for my R&R flight early so I spent a day or two hanging around, trying to get on an earlier flight but mostly reading.

One day at the coffee shop near the terminal, a young PFC from the 101st asked me if he could talk to me. I had nothing to do and nowhere to go and since an Army sergeant is there to provide guidance to troops, I said sure. He told me his unit was sending him back because they thought he was crazy. I asked why they thought that. He said his platoon sergeant was a haji-lover and when his team leader kicked in a door, an old man shot him. The platoon sergeant apologized and gave him his gun back. In retaliation, this PFC said he punted this platoon sergeant's adopted puppy off a roof and doused it with diesel and set it ablaze (these were his words not mine).

I excused myself as I was very uncomfortable as you can imagine, saying I think they were calling my name.

Fast foward to 2014 and by a twist of fate, I was around people in that unit at that time and they recounted this story and recommended I read the book ""Black Hearts: One Platoon's Descent Into Madness"".  I also recommend this book as it sets the stage for this horrendous event very well.

Picture this: you’re out and about, maybe grabbing your favorite coffee, and you stumble across a Bitcoin BTM—a sleek, futuristic machine promising you instant access to the world of Bitcoin! No more online exchanges or lengthy sign-up processes; just the digital cash you want, in minutes. Bitcoin BTMs (Bitcoin Teller Machines) are popping up everywhere, bringing a dose of old-school ATM convenience to the modern crypto revolution. But with every great BTM experience, there’s a secret weapon that makes the process even better: the [**free Bitcoin QR code maker dApp**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com). Let’s dive into how Bitcoin BTMs and this handy QR code tool are setting the stage for a cashless, crypto-rich future!

# What’s a Bitcoin BTM, Anyway?

Let’s start with the basics. A Bitcoin BTM, or Bitcoin Teller Machine, functions much like a traditional ATM, but instead of dispensing cash, it allows you to buy or sell Bitcoin and sometimes other cryptocurrencies. If you're wondering why anyone would need this when they could use an exchange online, the answer is simple: convenience. With a Bitcoin BTM, there’s no need to link your bank account, wait for approvals, or deal with complicated setups. You walk up to the machine, select your options, scan a QR code for your Bitcoin wallet, and you’re on your way.

Bitcoin BTMs can be found in coffee shops, convenience stores, shopping malls, and even gas stations! These machines are changing the way people interact with crypto by bringing it right into their daily lives, no smartphone required (although, of course, having your phone handy helps). Now, the key to getting Bitcoin smoothly from these BTMs? QR codes. This is where the **Bitcoin QR Code Maker dApp** comes into play.

# Meet Your New Best Friend: The Free Bitcoin QR Code Maker dApp

If you’re going to make the most out of a Bitcoin BTM, you need an easy way to manage your wallet address. Typing in a long Bitcoin address by hand? No, thank you! That’s where the [**free Bitcoin QR code maker dApp**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com) comes in. This dApp generates a scannable QR code that links directly to your Bitcoin wallet, saving you from potential typos and saving time in the process.

Imagine you’re at a Bitcoin BTM ready to make a quick purchase. Instead of fumbling with a long string of numbers and letters, you simply pull up your QR code on your phone, let the machine scan it, and voilà! You’re ready to go. The dApp allows you to generate QR codes effortlessly, and because it’s a web-based app, you can access it anytime, anywhere, without downloading anything.

# Why QR Codes are a Game-Changer for Bitcoin BTMs

Here’s why QR codes are the unsung heroes of the BTM experience:

1. **Quick and Easy Scanning:** QR codes eliminate the need to enter wallet addresses manually, which means fewer mistakes and quicker transactions. In a world where speed matters, especially in financial transactions, this is a huge advantage.
2. **Enhanced Security:** Typing out your wallet address in public can feel risky, especially if prying eyes are around. With a QR code, you can securely share your wallet address without revealing any information unnecessarily.

1gjk2w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/R4R30Plus/comments/1gjk2w6/32f4r_colorado_aromantic_bisexual_looking_for/,"32[F4R] #colorado Aromantic, bisexual looking for connections and companionship ","Hello lovely human. Thanks for checking out my post. 

Essentially, I’m an aromantic bisexual chic looking for connection, friendship and companionship in forms outside of “typical” romantic relationships. 

Something on the lines of a queer platonic relationship or deeper friendship(s) or a non romantic life partner. This type of companionship could look like a lot of different things, could be two people or more. I’m fairly open, the key point being that it’s not primarily romantic. 

I simply don’t have authentic desire for romantic intimacy. I like the idea of it; it’s cute to read about or see on TV, and I understand it on an intellectual level but I don’t feel romantic love or romantic attraction. And any attempts I’ve made feel disingenuous and fake. 

However I do desire companionship, and interpersonal relationships. I’d love to have  a person (or people) to share life with, to  spend time with, to travel with and to have deep conversations with.  

I’m very drawn to sharing experiences and intellectual connections, and I do experience platonic and familial love. As I am bisexual, I also enjoy physical relationships as well, though this isn’t a requirement.

Probably also important to note that I do want a kid in the near-ish future. I’m exploring single motherhood options, but am also open to the possibility of finding someone to share all/part of that experience with. 

At this point I’m not really focused on location or age (just be over 21). Aesthetic attraction is kinda important, and of course physical attraction if it’s that type of relationship. No smokers, no hard drugs, no heavy drinkers. Kid friendly, dog friendly. Personality, shared interests and values are important. Also probably important to mention I live in a rural town in Colorado with  no immediate plans to change that. 

More about me- Gemini, INTJ, ADHD, very pragmatic, free spirited and independent. I value knowledge, curiosity and honesty. Travel is my biggest passion with 42 countries visited so far. I’m nerdy in a pop culture sort of way (MCU, HP, Star Wars) and I adore going to Disney theme parks. I’m into witchy things like tarot and crystals. I like to write, read and craft. I don’t go out much, and I pretty much loathe parties or small talk. I deal with some social anxiety, though weirdly being anonymous in a crowd doesn’t bother me. I like bookstores and coffee shops, the occasional museum or night out dancing. I rarely drink, dont smoke or do any type of drugs. Technically Christian but not practicing, more spiritual perhaps. Politically I’m somewhere between moderate and liberal but pretty much dislike anything political. I’m white, reddish hair, blue eyes, short and slim/average built. 

So, there’s the gambit. I know there’s other out there like me. Just finding something so likeminded can be tricky! But here’s to ",3,1730741723.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

We've known each other for a little over a month now, and we’ve grown close very quickly. For instance, we’ve gone out for coffee a few times, and we can talk for hours without getting bored.

Whatever this is between us feels special to me, especially because of her sense of humor.

My concern is that if her feelings aren’t mutual, it could impact our friendship. I haven’t felt this way about anyone else I’ve dated, and I’m unsure how to manage these feelings without risking our current connection.

1gjjwwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1gjjwwp/anyone_out_there_loves_coffee_so_much_but_has/,Anyone out there loves coffee so much but has eczema like me? 😭. ,"I completely ignore it. The fact that probably Coffee (i drink capuccino with Oat/ Coconut drink) can trigger my hands-arms eczema 😭. Not sure if it would be the coffee itself, the oat/ coconut drink - which contains sugar) or the combination of both🥲.

I did elimination diet for about a month (two months ago). Removed coffee, dairy (inkl the alternatives), sugar, and gluten. Breakfast only with one banana. I drank only moringa tea, and alot water. Ate only salmon, tuna, chicken, non high histamine veggies and used only olive oil. It could clear 80% of my flares up within less than a month. And of course after that I reintroduced the things again. What for me really important was coffee (my capuccino). As I only drank one cup capuccino per day, with oat/ coconut drink, nothing happened. Then I drank 2 cups per day. Since then, the flare slowly came back 😭😭😭. Another of course stupid thing, I ate banana chips which contains sugar. Noe my left hand turns so red, and itchy like hell. More and more rashes on the arms. Oh God help😭. 

I couldnt imagine myself to do the same elimination diet again. Then there will be nothing left on my body😭😖. I am 50 kg now and 165 cm tall.

1gjjrgj,https://www.reddit.com/r/NursingUK/comments/1gjjrgj/anyone_else_fed_up_with_the_domestics/,Anyone else fed up with the domestics?,"EDIT: Seems like my ward is just unlucky, i absolutely agree that good domestics are a heaven sent. Unfortunately, the good domestics in my ward get bullied… 

I work in mental health ward as a CSW and my whole team, including the managers, are incredibly frustrated with the domestics. There are maybe two domestic staff who genuinely get the job done, the rest barely do the bare minimum. 

These are just some of the complaints we raise again and again:

- Sometimes there will be obvious messes that they are supposed to clean up as a part of their routine and it just gets ignored

- They hide in the cleaners closet and drink tea while not on break instead of cleaning

- They lie to us about asking patients if they want their rooms cleaned and them saying no

- They hide food for themselves BEFORE serving the patients (if it’s leftovers that are going to be tossed, yes of course staff will eat it, but this isn’t leftovers) 

- They refuse to give patients things like biscuits and yoghurts and say stuff like “if you give it to one person, everyone else will think they can have one” (yes, that’s the point ???)

- They act high and mighty like they know more than the clinical staff and like they own the kitchen - some of them don’t even clean up properly, and the clinical staff has to do things like get the tea tray ready and wipe up

- Their management doesn’t not do anything about any of the aforementioned issues. We speak to them, our managers talk to theirs, nothing happens. 

 - They are often rude to patients unprovoked, yes, in MH wards some patients are abusive but those aren’t the ones they are rude to, they are rude to people who politely ask them for something.

- Their managers often come to the kitchen and when clinical staff comes in there too (it’s a part of our job, making tea and coffee for the patients, and also sometimes we need a drink of water or something ourselves), they look at us like we are dirt, especially the CSWs, and act rude and nasty, sometimes outright telling us to get out or asking “why are you here?”

The list goes on and on and I’m bloody exhausted. These women also spread gossip and the one female domestic who actually does her fair share AND picks up the slack after the others is bullied by them, they are nasty to her and  and nothing is done about this. Nothing. We complained and reported it. ",4,1730740981.0,NursingUK,18,0.6,False

After namin magkape nun naisip ko rin na di ko rin siya masyado bet kasi introvert din siya and mas sanay talaga ako sa mga extroverts kaya during our first date I was so sure na last date na rin namin yun and baka di na kami magpansinan sa chat HAHAHAH.

yes that means 15 hrs of driving in 3 WHEELBASE. i mostly do ACC, Monza, Nurburgring.

u can say i should do RMA, but TM says i brought it from distributor, no refund (WTH?), this is clearly a design fault / building issue, they should do a global re-call

Perhaps to start with - some intro, age and where you’re from? Tell me how your weekend was and what you wish you could be doing right now instead of checking r4r posts on Reddit! 

See you on the other side!

  
P.S. - Not my first post! I've chatted with some wonderful folks from my previous ones, but nothing stuck. So, here I am, giving it another shot!!

I think she thinks she is a character in a movie (I guess she kind of is because this is a show) but this is an actual game where u have to be real and remove yourself from narratives u are making up in your mind. She talks a big talk with Avinash, strategises all day but doesn't do much. I feel more than being herself she is playing a character of someone who would be on bigg boss if they made a movie about it. Her expressions and mannerisms are so strange. I think Sara has more potential to give us some Pooja what is this behavior type content, i laughed out loud when she chucked the coffee.

Also seeing the three of them is like seeing nibba nibbi drama of two different rival friend groups in college first year or that dramatic group who were obsessed with planning fests and how they are perceived. They just talk about the game but dont do shit. Also when Vivian hangs out with them it looks like he is a professor hanging out with kids at recess.

I have developed a crush on a SSV who has been there for a while, we are around the same age (18-20) and both share some similarities regarding hobbies and music and are pretty much the same with our sense of humor. I actually had to close with just him and me last week due to a fellow barista calling out sick, and I feel like we bonded A LOT. 

He complimented my taste in drinks, saying he respected how I drink cold brew and more coffee forward drinks. And we talked about mutual interests as well as some of our life struggles. 

We are both autistic so I feel like I can’t tell if he is interested? Or if we are both just really friendly. 

Another part that makes it a bit difficult to tell is he has talked before about a crush he has at his college and on one of my more recent shifts he mentioned he was studying with her two days this week to one of the other baristas he is friends with but didn’t seem excited or anything like he usually is when he talks about her. 

Maybe I am overthinking it, but worst case scenario we are both just friendly and I misread it, which isn’t unsurprising for me.

But it was about her first meeting up with my mom and grandma to talk because she missed them. And then a few days later coming to the house to make coffee for them and then talk to me one on one. She said she loved me still but doesnt see me as a partner. She said she regrets leaving me but tried to justify it to make herself feel better by saying that maybe God was using her to make me a better person for someone else… well anyway back to this recent thing that happened. This Saturday she comes to the church group. shes finally coming around. She used to purposely avoid going to anything church related since the break up. However idk how i should even act anymore because everyone knows we aren’t together since they’ve seen me for months without her and obviously in that time people ask and i would have explained why. And obviously i miss just being able to interact with her as a bf/gf and i just end up feeling jealous of her being able to act normal around people and giving everyone else attention. We did talk after the group meeting was over and i just asked would it be ok to talk while in group and she said “yea there’s no problem if we do talk we need to heal that.” “I cant keep feeling like we cant be in the same room together”. Maybe i should take that as a good thing? Is starting as friends and just being that for a while something i should consider as a good thing? Cus my problem is i keep thinking its a bad thing. I think well if were not together why should i act like friends if all i want is to be with her! Part of me wants to hurry up the process. But that gives me a lot of anxiety. Should i accept that everything is going in the right direction for union? Should i stop letting my confusion, or HER confusion of what she wants, affect me and i should just accept that its all working out in my favor and i just gotta give her time? I admit my age is affecting me too because i want so much to be married and have kids and im male 30yo. Should i leave that anxiety behind as well and just accept that Gods plan is actually working out and maybe ill probably sabotage it if i keep pushing?

Recently, I've been trying to reconnect with one of my old hobbies which is writing short fiction. Before we got married I used to dream about writing short stories for a small audience. Not for monetary reasons, just because I like to tell little stories and entertain people

Anyway, life and work and marriage and everything got in the way, and I stopped writing for a very long time. I'm now trying to make more time for things like hobbies and family outings. So along with writing my little stories, I've also been doing more stuff like organizing day hikes and date nights. Just overall trying to get out of this slump we've been in since covid of just staying inside and watching TV all night.

So back to the writing. To do this, I need to be away from distraction or it just doesn't work. I've been getting on my laptop in our spare room/office for 30-60 minutes and working on them. And every single time, my wife has been...weird about it.

First I can just feel tension start whenever I get my coffee cup and laptop and get up. She knows where I'm gonna go and starts to look hurt. Every time, she asks me ""Where are you going?"" in this pleading kind of voice and I tell her I'm just going into the other room for a little while, to work on my stories. Then I get an ""OK"" or ""Oh"" and a stone face. Then for a few hours after, everything just feels awkward.

I've talked to her about it. She first wanted to know why I couldn't write on the couch with her and the TV and everything. I told her it's too distracting and I need to be alone. Then she told me that she thinks I just don't want to spend time with her. I told her that was ridiculous - If I'm not at work, I'm with her for 100% of my time. All I want is an hour every couple days to go into the other room. She said ""Well, FINE"" all huffy and won't talk about it anymore, but every time I do it she gets upset at me.

I don't know where this is coming from or why she's feeling so insecure about it. She won't really talk to me about it anymore either. Just...not really sure what to do.

Is this a normal reaction? Would you feel left out or upset if your partner went in the other room for a little bit?

I just bought Nurosym for my troubles. Post consussion syndrome since 2 years ago. Visual snow, histamine intolcerance and most likley POTS (not-diganosed). Have not been able to work or exercise above 100 heartrate, or any other things that might demand high mental and physical energy. Things have improved, but still troubles. So I have too much hope in this device.

I tried it for a first time 3 days ago. 15min-15 lvl. I got some strange feelings in limbs, light headache but still got a rather nice relaxed and energized feel to it. But then its been up-and-down. Sometimes it makes me feel bad - I get headache very fast, light pain in hands, a feel very weak as if I've not eaten for a while or been drinking too much coffee.

It also gives me some pain in face (which I have since my concussion), around eyes, cheeks and even teeths. This troubles has been much better since a couple of months ago, but can flare up with stress. Nurosym makes this wors, but the edge goes away fast but it can still be there for a couple of hours. Been trying different levels, 10 to 15 min with everything from 8 to 15 - 2 to 3 times a day for 3 days now. Sometimes I feel some benefits, but always some of these side effects. I just tried it a couple of hours ago and got nothing but side effects.

I also have a lot of problem finding the right spot on the ear. I rarley feel a light sensation wihout it hurting. It often goes from not feeling anything to burning pain that sometimes goes into the ear. Have tried moist and so on.

I will now try very carefully again. Start with 1min, low level and build up through some times.

Anyone has experience similar things? If so, gets better? Any general tips?",2,1730738642.0,Nurosym,0,1.0,False

If you don't want to watch, **here are my 3 takeaways:**

**1) ALWAYS sign an NDA with everyone** you're working with (from employees to contractors). At some point, investors will ask for it.

**But my biggest takeaway...**

If you're thinking about selling, go and draft up your business offer. Write everything down that you want to share with a potential buyer.

Then... go to sleep.

Wake up.

Grab a coffee.

Read your document.

See if you still want to sell when you realize you have a pretty good thing going on.

1gjirbz,https://www.reddit.com/r/phlgbt/comments/1gjirbz/aamin_na_ako_kay_friend_sa_cruise_trip_namin_sa/,Aamin na ako kay “friend” sa cruise trip namin sa travel naming 2 lng sa Thailand - evolve feelings,"Long Post ahead.

First time to post as I am not out.

It all started sa socmed, as far as I remember ni add ko sya sa IG (codename: Labubu) kc sa total of looks (medyo above average naman) and gym fit. Nag Hi lng ako as usual para mapansin (medyo above average looks and toned din naman ako ) and makapag start ng convo, nag reply naman sya nun after pero super short convo lng namin since wala naman kc connections/topic na pag uusapan, after the taga san ka etc.

After few weeks nag chat sya since im into camera at mag birthday sya if pwd ko daw ba sya i shoot sa apartment na rent nya, so nag usap kami about dun and concept and all, Sympre free lng since wala naman sya budget for that and di naman din ako pro pa that time just hobbyist.

Then before this shoot for his birthday, may opening sa isa mall client nya as a graphic artist and need daw ng mag shoot sa event, and since hobbyist lng ako ( though pro cam na gamit) ayaw ko sana kc baka di magustuhan, then sabi no pressure naman daw kc maliit lang TF, need lng mag document sa opening and andun naman daw sya to guide. So nag go na ako sabi ko daanan ko sya para sabay na kami pumunta sa mall since along the way lang kanila. So eto yung first meet up namin

Sympre sa una trip ko sya pero when we meet in person, medyo iba sa expectations ko syempre sa socmed iba, di sya makinis sa face that time same sa pic though d naman ganun kalala may few pimples lng pero lean fit na sya nun, ako naman cge tropa nlng to since we have same hobby, natapos event drop ko sya sa kanila na wala nangyari kahit akbay or shake hands man lng pagka drop so ayun cge to tropahin nlng

Weeks after nag shoot na kami sa apartment nya JUNE 2023, nag set up kami parang studio since I have lights and bumili sya pang background na malaki same sa mga studio, then the theme ng shoot nya is yung mga model reels sa studio pero may pants and jacket only pero open buttons, success naman after that free dinner naman nya and after uwian na na wala nangyari,

Goods din naman kc kahit sexy shoot sya di rin naman ako nalibog kc nga tropa tropa nlng, 

Then comes weeks months lagi nlng kami lumalabas, pumupunta sa iba iba restaurant and coffee shop dito sa province (Luzon) na almost weekly nun 2023 or twice a month lagi naman half kami sa expenses para may ma post din sa socmed as yun nga hobby namin

Pumunta ng Tagaytay first out of province namin day tour as a tropa lng talaga wala nangyari, then iba iba coffee shop sa iba weeks then one day naisip ko mag Baguio sakto may friend sya dun na pwd namin pag stayan, so naisip ko parang chance na to na magtabi kami ng kama since makikitulog lng sa fren nya, nung andun na kami after gumala parang nabanggit nya sa fren nya na “fren yun sinabi ko sayo” meaning parang extra matress sa baba at ako sa kama sa isa kwarto so red flag na sa akin yun na tropa nlng talaga, kc parang ayaw nya ako makatabi as possible kc nga baka may mangyari ganun cguro.

di sya straight afaik kc sa mga comment sa iba post nya pala is parang alam ng iba frens nya kc baks iba comment sa mga fb post nya nung output ng shoot namin.

Nov 2023 yun kinabukasan nag libot pa din kami ng Baguio na kami 2 lng then late night nlng sumunod fren nya girl para mag kape and chill lng kami, which naging close ko na din si girl. So napag usapan na travel. Plan na mag Taiwan ng March

From Jan 2024 to March labas pa din kami ni Labubu at least once or twice month kain lng and shoot till  dumating ang time to travelTaiwan na mga normal travel lng to then 1st mag tabi ng kama kc 2 lang kama, kami ni Labubu sa isa then si Girl at Jowa nya sa kabila, though technically tabi2 kami 4 kc pinagfabi 2 bed kc maliit lng airbnb

*napansin ko lng na malayo agwat namin ni Labubu sa kama na di man lng magdikit balat namin so sympre para di awkward ako na naglagay ng pilllow sa gitna

Comes April to June 2024 parang 1 a month nlng labas namin kc halos wala na din mapuntahan dito para may ma post kami pero niyaya ko sya mag Elyu which is pumayag naman.

*sya na pinaghanap ko accoms para pasok sa budget nya and may options dun sa pinaka mura is 1 queen bed or 2 single beds which is mas mahal cguro ng 300 php pero pinili pa din nya ang 2 single beds

Nag Floatsam din kami 2 and may nakilala sya sa isa group na schoolmate nya na kasama jowa nila (gay and bi group ata yun) nag hi lng sya and sabi nya kami lng magkasama, niyaya sya sa group nya pero di  pumayag so nag ikot2 onti party nlng sa gilid gilid ng floatsam 

Then next months once a month meet and shoot kain sa labas till Sept 24 nag Indonesia naman kami with group with kasama sa frens sa Taiwan last time and new group, friends of friend total 8

Here comes exciting part:
2 weekends  before pala ng trip eh nag shopping kami ng susuotin, mas maporma yun sa akin so suggest sya ng ganito ganyan, bagay mo yan etc which greenflag na appreciate ko yun

Tapos same trip talaga kami even sa airplane palang kunware nasa business class kami may mga baon kami food.

It’s a 1 week IT so iba dun d naman namin trip kaya may 3 days kami nag solo kami 2 sa mga trip lng namin na puntahan, gym too ganyan, iba iba magaganda coffee shop and Day Club dun,

Pinagsama nlng din namin pocket money namin which is $600 kc para puro sharing nlng kami since di naman kami malakas kumain and para madami ma try. ( so parang magjowa nga)

Tapos sa group kc may mag jowa din na lalaki, so tine tease nila kami na ang sweet daw namin kc sharing sa food etc and lagi kami magkasama even maglakad or sa sasakyan and nag solo pa ng itinerary, di naman sya nagdeny silent lng kami pag tease (green flag again)

Not sure ano status namin as far as Baguio frens nya na una namin na meet dati since it’s not normal to have this closeness for 2 guys and feeling ko alam naman status ni Labubu ng fren nya na di sya straight.

So dito pala mej red flag na din kc separate room and isa Kama na kami wala pa din nangyari, sa pagtulog talikuran pa din, once nga naisip ko yakapin sya pero wala ako lakas ng loob ayaw ko mag first move

So natapos ang Indonesia trip na alam ko sa isip ko tropa lng kami ganyan, even sa pasalubong pala nagpabili nlng ako kc di ako nakapunta sa market doon ang nag ooffer pa syad ng iba nabili nya since ref magnet lng talga gusto ko and often traveler din naman ako so di na ako bili pasalubong, another green flag kay Labubu

Tapos pagkauwi pala sa Pinas nag dinner pa kami 2 bago umuwi yun ang last namin then sumunod eto Sat Sun lng nung nagpatulong ako errands ko

So eto yun agony ko:
Since after Indonesia last week of Sept lng naguguluhan ako parang gusto ko sya lagi kasama, though lowkey lng ako since kakagaling lang din namin sa gastos so di muna kami makakalabas, 1 month na ako naguguluhan sa feelings ko (if in love na ba ako sa kanya and di nalng tropa2) or baka dahil matagal lng kami nagksama sa recent travel and madami kmi solo days.

Summary:

May mga down kami kc minsan mabagal sya reply days ganyan pero pag magkasama naman kami na appreciate ko now mga effort nya as in pero in terms of ma score feeling ko malabo


2 weeks ago ko pa to compose dahil busy ngayon ko lng na finalise, solo trip na namin now sa Thailand and may book ako cruise sa Wednesday so for my piece of mind ako na aamin since after Indonesia namin gulong gulo na ako, ano ba status namin beshie lng ba or wat kc na appreciate ko na sya sobra.

At least kung ano man desisyon nya maka move on na ako or pag success at least magka label na even just the 2 of us lng kc nga tago

Ps: nung gumagawa ako IT for Thailand nag sesend2 sya vids for tiktok na maganda puntahan pabiro ko pa sabi dyan ba tayo mag date? Reply lng nya sanaol may date.

Pero feeling ko naman medyo more than friends tingin nya, pero pag wala mag first move wala mangyayari.

Di ko din sure if Go sya sa mga gaybar dito like DJ and G Bangkok so whatever the decision on Wednesday yayain ko sya dito since aamin na ako sa kanya sa feelings ko, sa IT lng kc namin sa Friday and weekends is PARTY lng

Nilagay ko din pala sa sinend ko IT na mag uusap kami seryoso sa cruise and ni chat pero no comment sya dun

Basta pag magkasama kc kami magka vibe talaga, masaya lng, same hobby gym, content creation diff branding lang, travel

Will update you ano mangyayari

Im 20f, i was prescribed a symbicort inhaler in jan of last year. I have been taking nyquil/dayquil this week. Sometimes i take reactine for cat allergies. I am very anemic. I take iron pills but not regularly (its hard for me to remember, hard to take with food cause i dont always want to eat)

I think ive been sick for about a month. My lymph node on my throat has been swollen and ive had headaches coming and going. 

It has been worse for the past week. My sinuses were hurting a lot under my eyes and i had a bad headache. I didn’t take my temperature so i dont know if i had a fever. I was feeling sort of hazy, dizzy, lightheaded during my class on Tuesday morning so i went home.

Now i think it’s been 6 days since i was feeling worse than before. My sinuses and head don’t hurt as badly as they did a few days ago. I feel hazy and sort of disoriented. I feel really, really tired. It feels like my body is full of sand and i feel like im just being pulled downwards every time i sit up or stand. Two days ago i left the house to get coffee with a friend and i was feeling very faint while sitting at a stool, like i thought i would pass out if i couldn’t lean on something. 

This morning i walked a block to a clinic and felt very faint. I had to lean on the wall while waiting in line. They could not see me at the clinic until wednesday.

I have tightness in my chest and shortness of breath but it feels different this time. I CAN breathe fully in but it hurts and makes me dizzy/see static. Mostly i think i’m breathing shallowly. I dont have a fever (37 degrees celsius this morning, 36.6 yesterday). I fainted twice in the past 2 weeks but both were at the club while i was drunk and dancing. I used my inhaler both times but it didn’t help. Prior to that ive never fainted while drunk or while dancing.

I dont know what i should do. I can’t be seen by a doctor until wednesday. I called the nurse hotline yesterday and was told to see a doctor within 24 hours based on my symptoms. My roommate is worried about me and wants me to go to emerg if I have to. I feel disoriented like i have while badly sick before but i don’t feel super super ill. 

Does anyone know what i might have so i can tell the doctor what i think it is? I thought mono because im so tired but not sure. I shared drinks with people at the club last weekend (the 26th)",1,1730738284.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False

Tarja Turunen is a Finnish singer-songwriter who became famous as the lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. She is also a professional classical lied singer and has a vocal range of three octaves. She launched her solo career in 2006 and has released many albums since then. She currently lives in Buenos Aires with her argentine husband and their daughter.  
  
**My relationship to Helsinki**  
  
I lived a few years in Helsinki, Munkkiniemi district, in the late 90's before moving to Germany for my studies. I really loved my little, cozy apartment in Munkkiniemi. I still have several friends in the Helsinki area, and my youngest brother Toni lives nearby. Nowadays I mainly visit Helsinki for busi- ness reasons, but also I go to see my friends and family every time I am back in Finland.  
  
Helsinki compared to other cities I have visited and lived in.  
  
Helsinki is still a rather small capital, even though it might feel like a big city for the Finns. You can have small trouble with the traffic sometimes if you are driving a car, but it is nothing compared to the city of Buenos Aires where I am living at the moment! There you really need to have patience with the traffic.  
But Helsinki is very attractive and cute at the same time. It is surrounded with sea and has lots of beautiful spots to enjoy the sea views and relax even though you are in the centre of the city.  
Helsinki is also a show off town for the Finnish design and you can find excellent boutiques and bars presenting the modern way of living in Finland.  

**Favourite place to perform in Helsinki**  
  
During my career I have performed in several different kinds of venues in Helsinki: arenas, churches, theatres, small clubs and even in The National Opera. From those for me the most impressive was the National Opera.
www.ooppera.fi. 
  
**Currently working with**  
  
I am currently working as a coach in TV show ""The Voice of Finland"" and producing my new rock album at the same time. I just finished the productions for my classical ""Ave Maria""-album and another rock live-album. Those two albums are going to see the light of day during this year.  
After the TV-program, I am heading to Russia for a classical concert tour and spending all the summer producing my rock album. In the fall I will have several rock tours in Latin America, and later in the year traditional Christmas tour in Finland and some other European countries.

A few months ago, I got inspired by a cooking show marathon (thanks, Netflix). I thought, “Why not unleash my inner Gordon Ramsay?” So, I bought an apron, a set of fancy knives, and dove headfirst into the culinary chaos.

Spoiler alert: cooking is way harder than it looks. I started off with simple recipes, but soon I was attempting soufflés and homemade pasta, which apparently require a degree in physics and a degree in patience. My first attempt at pasta ended with flour explosions that looked like a snowstorm hit my kitchen. My dog, who usually has a knack for staying out of trouble, now only hangs around to salvage whatever food drops to the floor.

After weeks of struggle and a few minor fires (don’t ask), I finally started to feel like a real chef. I could sauté like a pro, whip up a mean marinara, and even plate dishes that looked semi-edible. So, I should be basking in culinary glory, right? Well, not quite.

Somehow, my brain decided that every moment is an opportunity for a gourmet experience. Waiting for my coffee to brew? Grab a frying pan and whip up an omelet. Bored during a meeting? Start brainstorming a five-course meal. I even tried to impress my friends by hosting a dinner party that turned into an episode of “Nailed It!” when my soufflé collapsed and my tiramisu ended up looking like a science experiment gone wrong.

And then there are the dreams. Last night, I had this bizarre dream where I was cooking a banquet for a royal family, but instead of a majestic castle, I was in my tiny apartment. I woke up sweating, half-expecting to find a Michelin star reviewer at my door.

So, has anyone else taken on a hobby that spiraled out of control and turned everyday life into a dramatic mess? Please tell me I’m not alone in this culinary chaos ",1,1730738131.0,CasualConversation,2,0.99,False

All my fat is in my upper body so no tops look nice on me anymore. Other than that it is just depressing. I've decided to do something about it.

I would really appreciate if you could tell me the way to get results as quick as possible.

What I think works well (from years ago when I looked after myself in regards to diet and exercise) was the following:

- Fasted cardio (often in the beginning, less later on, for example 5 days a week and later only 3 or 2 days a week)

- Intermittent fasting 8 hours and then later the 4 hour window

- 5 days normal eating a week, 2 days in between eating very little (5:2 I think it's called)

- Eating no later than 6 pm

- Having dinner within an hour after exercise

- HIIT instead of steady state exercises

- Weight lifting at least 3 times a week, later 5 days a week

- Eat between 1 and 1.5g of protein per kg of bodyweight

- At least 2 liters of water per day

- Only water and black coffee or green tea

- No sugar

- No carbs (I know this is debatable, I won't be cutting it out permanently but just to get to my goal quicker I think this is a good idea?)

- Going to bed earlier, not midnight anymore as I'm a nightowl

And that's it. If you can add to this list or maybe you have a better alternative to any of these, let me know.

I know weight loss should be slow and steady and healthy, but I'll aim for that after my December holiday, for now I want aggressive and quick.

I figured it might be good to put together a thread of advice for those people to make things run smoother.

1.) TAKE NOTES - you’re allowed to consult your phone or a piece of paper in the polling booth. Even if you’re not voting ahead of time it’ll make completing your ballot easier if you write out the down ballot choices ahead of time. The faster you vote the sooner someone else can use the station and the more votes we move.

2.) GO EARLY - I get it; early’s not your thing or you would’ve voted by now. I’ve voted on E-Day almost every year since 2002 so I can’t talk. But I can say the lines are usually shorter earlier and if they’re not you have the rest of the day still for a contingency if you just can’t get to it.

3.) MOST ARE ENTITLED TIME - In 28/50 states employers are *required* to give you time during the day to go and vote. Take advantage of that and make sure you’re on the same page as your boss.

4.) NO POLITICAL GEAR - We all know at this point that you’re not allowed to wear shirts or hats or whatever too close to the polls that it could be considered electioneering. But it bears repeating just in case. You don’t want to have to flip your shirt around or, god forbid, have to run home and change it.

5.) BRING A SNACK - Even if there’s no wait time think of it as a post vote treat. And if there is a wait you won’t find yourself feeling faint, thirsty or irritable. Just be careful about sharing depending on the state you’re in (as my next point suggests.)

6.) WARM THE LINE - While this act is prohibited in some states, in others you are allowed to hand out snacks, coffees and water to those standing in line as long as it’s not dependent on  them voting a certain way. Again though, make sure your state allows this and check in with your polling place workers first.

7.) BE KIND - Working the polls sucks. Being old and waiting in line sucks. Waiting in line with kids sucks. Dealing with entitled red hat sporting maroons sucks. If you can be the antidote for any of that, do your best. Many folks are anxious about the results and if you have the bandwidth to be reassuring you’ll be a rockstar.

Are there any other I’m missing or you feel should be added to help our same day voting brothers and sisters?

To keep this short my Ex moved out this weekend and has left empty spaces across my 1bd room apartment. I work full time remote, have no pets and love to host family and friends. 

Fairly manageable budget in order to fill the empty spaces like the walls, book shelves, 

Bedroom - Was planning on moving my desk to the other side of my bed to mount 2 monitors to the wall. Maybe adding a keyboard set up as I am looking to pick up a new hobby. Lots of closet space so another dress isn’t really necessary. If moving the desk going to need a smaller carpet to be able to move my desk chair. There used to be carpet (on “her” side). That short long dress will be removed as that’s hers. 

Living room - book shelf either can be removed as I don’t have many books (not opposed to pick up coffee table books to fill space). Taking down some prints on that gallery wall as they are hers. But will just fill the space with new prints of my interests. 

Kitchen and bathroom areas are fine and easy to fill in the space. 

Any links or photos of your own set ups can possible be replicated in my place would be appreciated.

""One of my favorite days of the year in Hoboken is Halloween. The best of our community is on display - from the annual Ragamuffin Parade, to the incredible decorations, to the joy felt by families while trick-or-treating. Like many of you, however, I was heavy with emotions from the news of two violent assaults earlier in the day. My thoughts are with the victims, and I’m grateful for the quick work of community members and the Hoboken Police Department to have apprehended both attackers. 

I believe in directly engaging with constituents, whether at pick up and drop off at school, at the local coffee shop, or on social media - connecting with people is not just my job, it is my purpose as a public servant. When I heard about these incidents, I knew we needed a transparent and open community dialogue about public safety and actions we can take as a community. I immediately reached out to Public Safety Director Ken Ferrante and Chief Steve Aguiar to organize a public meeting for residents to speak directly with the Hoboken Police Department and Mayor Bhalla about their concerns. Please consider joining this community meeting on Wednesday, November 6 at 5:30pm at City Hall (94 Washington, enter via Newark Street). 

I am proud to support a strong public safety department as a Hoboken parent, social worker, and dedicated public servant. I have spent this past weekend listening to other parents and concerned residents about what they are seeing in our community, and how they feel these concerns should be addressed. As the City Council enters the 2025 session and will be developing our budget proposal, I am requesting funding for the following investments in public safety:

- Funding for an updated surveillance camera system for Church Square Park;
- Installation of the emergency blue light phone system in all City Parks and along the Waterfront, similar to the version that Hudson County installed in Columbus Park.
- Additional funding for Park Patrols - a combination of both police officers and code enforcement officers who have the ability to monitor quality of life issues like smoking in our parks, as well as more serious concerns about safety.

Finally, I am aware that the Administration is actively in the process of contract negotiations with both Police Unions. I strongly recommend that the Administration work with Police Union Leadership to advance a proposal that includes signing bonuses for the recruitment of new officers. The City of Hoboken needs to be as competitive as possible to ensure that we can fully staff our Police Department, while continuing to serve as a model nationwide for community policing.

Since I was working like crazy a few years ago I didn’t get to have much fun but now I’m freelance and have more time to seriously consider finding a real daddy. I had a great arrangement that lasted two years but since then it’s bleak!

Most of the time potential SDs want to meet up for a lunch/dinner/coffee to see how vibes are, are we always have a good time! I’m personable (worked in a professional space, have traveled and lived internationally, and lived and interesting life) and we always have a great time. When it’s dinner I always get made up and look great and I get the feeling the guys love showing me off, but they never offer to give me a gift 💰 and sometimes they just want another dinner date rather than getting onboard. I feel like free arm candy… forever! 

Is anyone ever serious? Are guys just cheap AF? Where are the real daddies?  Is everyone just always shopping?! ",5,1730737301.0,sugarlifestyleforum,11,0.78,False

Once i reached there, she took me to a table where her 'cousin/friend' was sitting. 

I told her I expected her to come alone since it was a date. She said its ok and tried to downplay it. I told her to come alone next time and got out of there.

Later she sent me a threatening and vulgar text and blocked me.

Thinking about it, She was never interested in me. She was hustling for 3 days to get a free meal for her and her cousin. And her plan failed miserably which led to her sending that text in the end.

The initial concept designer did not really understand much about kitchen layout and translated ""the kitchen matters to me"" into ""I will make it as big as possible.""

I gave up fighting over the details since I knew I could work with the interior designer to shift some things. I thought you folks might offer some different thoughts and ideas. Or can tell me if I'm being overly critical, it's very challenging to visualize this thing and maybe it's not as bad as I think.

Requests

* Clear zones for food prep, cleaning, baking and a coffee/bar. I bake a lot of bread and hunt, so I often have to process large amounts of meat.
* At least one large counterspace is key for working dough and making sausage.
* It would be incredible to have some counter height split that works for a very tall \~6' and very short \~5' person.
* I cook 95% of my meals at home: wok cooking, curries, soups, gas griddle use are all very common in a typical week.
* Side-by-side standalone freezer and refrigerator.
* That side sink can go.
* There is still a chance to move windows, but generally they are probably OK where they are

Problems?

My main concern is the the work triangle, the flow seems disconnected with small pieces of counter instead of larger chunks. Additionally, the entrance with the dining room seems so disconnected from the kitchen. Some ideas to adjust these issues:

1: Attach the dining table or build a banquette onto the island  
2: Remove island seating  
3: Shift wall oven elsewhere

Appreciate any and all thoughts!

We're planning on doing a 7 night safari. We have trip options with &Beyond and Asilia. If someone has stayed at both, can you please let me know which one you preferred? We'll spend a night in Arusha before the safari (it seems like everyone uses Arusha Coffee Lodge, is there any reason to stay elsewhere?).

Currently we have these options:

&Beyond

* 3 night &Beyond Grumeti Serengeti River Lodge
* 2 nights &Beyond Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
* 2 nights &Beyond Bateleur Camp

Asilia

* 2 nights Neptune Ngorongoro Luxury Lodge
* 3 nights Asilia Sayari Camp
* 2 nights Asilia Naboisho Camp

I saw rave reviews for Asilia Namiri Plains Camp, should we go there instead one of the other locations? There's supposed to be a lot of big cats at Namiri, which are my favorites. Moreover, we've seen the big 5 in South Africa but we haven't seen cheetahs on a safari. We're also planning a hot air balloon ride, looks like both providers booked it in Masai Mara. I know it's the short rains season, I've read that it doesn't cause much of an issue since it's in the afternoons and hopefully there'll be a lot less people!",2,1730737079.0,travel,1,1.0,False

I've never been tired in the afternoon before and barely dream when I sleep. But today it was different so I wonder if my following dream wants to tell me sth. 

In my dream I met a guy from med school. I knew him from a previous seminar (I dislike him in real life cuz he's very arrogant but in my dream I somehow had sympathy for him). We had a really good talk and he was funny and sweet to me. After a while I invited him to come home with me to have a coffee. So we went home and got closer and ended up cuddling with each other. He got up and locked the doors so nobody would disturb us and I had the feeling that were going to do the act of love so I closed my eyes. When he came back he layed on me and I remember that I could barely breathe due to his weight. I heard some weird noises and a light pain when I re-opened my eyes I saw that he implanted some mini-magnets in my nose and ears which were connected to 4 external magnets. He then pulled these 4 external in his direction and it was by far the most painful thing I ever experienced (in my dream). I panicked but somehow escaped that situation and drove back to uni cuz I was already running late for the next seminar. I remember that I considered to go to hospital after the seminar in order to get the magnets out but it didn't seem as important as going to uni. Then I woke up and realised that in real life my seminar started in a few minutes.

My dream is somehow disturbing to me cuz it felt so real. I still have pain in my nose and ears (maybe I'm getting sick?) 
It's also weird cuz I'm lesbian and absolutely dislike guys who often caused trauma to me in the past. Why would I ever hook up with that guy from uni? 
Also I have trust issues and I takes time for me to invite someone to come home with me. Also why didn't I go to uni directly? Does it mean I put my own needs under my obligations? 

The only good thing is that my brain warned me that I'd be late for uni and woke me up 😅

I'm happy for any sort of interpretation and yes, I know that it was just a dream and dreams don't always make sense. But some of my dreams actually warned me from sth in the past. ",1,1730736997.0,Dream,0,1.0,False

1gji359,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TomSgFit/comments/1gji359/is_the_nespresso_pixie_still_worth_it/,Is the Nespresso Pixie Still Worth It?,"For coffee lovers in search of a reliable, compact espresso machine, the [Nespresso Pixie](https://brands.amazrock.com/product/nespresso-pixie-espresso-machine-by-delonghi-aluminum/) remains a relevant and popular choice, even years after its initial release. Known for its simplicity, durability, and quick performance, the Pixie continues to be a go-to model for many coffee enthusiasts.



# Here’s why

First, the Pixie’s **compact size** makes it ideal for small kitchens, offices, or dorms. While newer Nespresso machines are often larger and bulkier, the Pixie’s small footprint is perfect for tight spaces. Despite its compact design, the Pixie doesn’t compromise on power: it heats up in just 25 seconds, so you can get your caffeine fix quickly.

Another key feature of the Pixie is its **ease of use**. With only two programmable buttons for espresso and lungo shots, it’s straightforward enough for anyone, even beginners, to master. There are no complicated settings or menus — just quality coffee at the touch of a button.

Durability is also a strong point. With a **sturdy metal exterior**, the Pixie has a premium feel that many plastic-bodied models lack. This robust construction helps it withstand years of use, keeping it looking great and running well over time.

As for **coffee quality**, the Pixie doesn’t disappoint. Like all Nespresso machines, it delivers a smooth, rich espresso with a creamy crema, pleasing even the most discerning coffee lovers. And with Nespresso's broad selection of coffee capsules, you’ll have plenty of options to explore.



# I would surmise

While it lacks the high-tech features or built-in milk frothers of newer machines, the Pixie’s **affordable price point** makes it a great value. If you’re looking for an espresso machine that’s durable, compact, and user-friendly, the Nespresso Pixie still holds its ground as an excellent choice.
