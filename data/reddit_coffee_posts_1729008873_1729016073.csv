1g4e8tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianmarriage/comments/1g4e8tb/differing_views_on_church_denominations/,Differing views on church denominations,"Hi...
I just posted something but I had A different conversation with my bf of a year and now need to write out my thoughts and hopefully get some good advice. 

My bf and I are not from the same denomination. I have grown up baptist and evangelical free and after a bad experience with a baptist church I've spent more time with evangelical free churches. My boyfriend on the other hand has grown up brethren his whole life. Not super traditional bretheren but enjoys how the services are. They generally have the breaking of the bread every week along with a message from an elder (no pastors) and they have a time where men can stand and pray, say a small sermon, or request a hymn. I kinda enjoy this way of church but I cannot get past the fact that women can't request hymns. 

I've talked to my boyfriend about it and he says that they use the verses about women not being able to speak, pray, or teach in the church as reasoning to their decision. I dont Believe in women pastors (I'm sorry to all who do this is just what I believe) but I do Think that women can be involved in the church in ways that match their spiritual gifts or ways that help them praise God better. In the church my bf goes to while we're in college is a bit more lenient than others as they have a contemporary worship time with a woman who sings but women cannot request hymns during the breaking of the bread service. Women can set up coffee, snacks, wash dishes, take care of babies and children, sing or play an instrument, but cannot request a hymn. This drives me sort of crazy. I explained to my boyfriend that in a way it stifles me from being able to praise God in the best way I can. I cannot Sing well, I cant play instrument, but I can find him's that relate to the theme and relate to how I'm feeling in that time. I love to find hymns that correlate with verses or the theme and it makes me sad that I'm not allowed to do that. My boyfriend said that he would request songs but some of the time he doesn't seem like he wants to. Last Sunday the theme was glory, and when I think of glory, I think of a crown placed on Jesus's head or something like that I don't know for some reason crowns just remind me of glory. I was looking through the hymnal and found the hymn ""Crown Him With Many Crowns"" and really wanted to sing it. I  asked my bf to request it and he kinda looked at me like he didn't want to so said ""I'll stand up and request it myself"" and then he said he would. When he requested it someone said ""hallelujah!"" Because it was a good song for the theme and the verses. 

That being said, I find it slightly demeaning and like I can't praise God the way I praise God because they're stopping me from doing that and it doesn't feel the same when someone else request the song for me. Some of the time I feel like just standing up and requesting it myself, but my boyfriend thinks that it would cause a lot of problems and be disrespectful towards the elders in the church and the other older people which I think so too Just get worked up and stand up. I don't see any reason why women shouldn't be able to request a song. My boyfriend says his only main concern is that it could cause problems within a church and that it's not good to have problems in the church. He told me that if I asked the church leader, then I could at least get reasons to why they don't let women request songs, but I told him that that doesn't solve anything because I already know mostly why and it still prevents me from praising God the way I would like to praise God. I feel like this might cause problems in our relationship because I can't go to a church that doesn't allow me to worship God the way that I would like to worship God and it stifles me from being myself. I kind of told him that I couldn't go to my bretheren church if this is how they treat women and he just kind of looked at me sadly. I don't think they treat women horribly, but it prevents me from being myself in church and being able to help the church in the way that I can help the church. I don't sing. I don't play instruments. I don't like babies and I really don't like taking care of children very much. And I'm not a great teacher and most of those are things that I could do in church like this.
I want to be involved in a church not Just be a watcher. But I don't want to stop my boyfriend from going to church that he's comfortable and then he's used to when we're married and I don't know what to do. I'm kind of crying thinking about this right now because I know he's should be the head of the house when we're married, but I don't think that I can go to church that doesn't allow me to praise God and the way that I would like to. But maybe I'm just getting worked up because I am stressed. Thoughts?

I'm an author writing a historical novel about one of my ancestors, Sarah Ann Hawk Crow (1830-1937), birthplace modern-day Coffee Co, Tenn (Manchester's the seat), death in Christian Co, Ky (Hopkinsville seat). Married to Confederate veteran Richard J Crow (1832-1885), drafted while they were living in Robertson Co, Tx.

For a woman without economic means living in her era, there's a tremendous deal of documentation about Sarah out there: AP reports, newspaper articles across mult states, area historical society books, etc. We also have a few family stories. After I began writing, I started finding all these other people who are also descended from Sarah and Richard. They had 9 children who spread out across the US (Ky, Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, etc), so it makes sense. Turns out maybe a fourth of the kids I went to elementary school with were descended from her.

Are you? I'm not joking. I realize this isn't a forum for finding long lost cousins, etc and that's not what I'm trying to do. I'd like to find new stories about Sarah, ones that weren't handed down through my family line but maybe were through yours. I found out Richard's role in the war, for ex, was a scout and a medic through stumbling upon a chat about him on a genealogy website. What stories was your family told?

Known descendant family names include Hawk, Hawks, Crow, Crowe, Wade, Wilson, Blades, Cansler, Armstrong, Hart, Arnold, Hill, Heflin, Ladd, Humphries, Ginn, Gresham, Poindexter, P'Pool, Colley, Hampton, deGaller, and more. I have a theory that half of western Ky is kin to her if we tracked it!

If this is you, please feel free to message me or comment below. Sarah and Richard's FindAGraves, in case that's helpful, are below, and THANKS!!

You know what? This haunted house ain't so haunted!   
Frawd has basically ran through every door without tripping a trap or seeing a baddie. Whatever monster the kids outside said there is, surely isn't around. Yeah, sure things are strange, but the house looks like its been well taken care of.   
That's until we discover a secret room and a skeleton within it! Judging by the note in the Deadman's hand, this could be the head of the family Durst, who may have been a servant for some fancy Lord named Strahd.   
Having no real leads left, we get back to discovering the rest of the mansion by going up to the final floor. Cept this time.....we trigger something and the suit of black armor at the end of the hallway comes alive and attacks us!  
Our party is really pathetic during this fight. It was bad....embarrassing almost. 'DnD weekly called it, ""*the beginning of the end???*""  
We nearly lose Frawd, who is swinging wildly and missing, while the black suit of armor rakes up hits against our party. EVENTUALLY....we get some solid hits on the thing and manage to blow it up to smithereens. This leaves us with a prime opportunity to discover the rest of the mansion in relative peace....right? Right?!

Dusty has bad heart burn, Steven and Cory head to Matt's old condo by mistake leaving Mark alone, to party again.





***Back to the Story!!!***





We are currently in the master bedroom. Frawd is somewhere, resting up after that fight, don't look into it, cause we won't. Nigellius is trying to get some spell spots back just like that, they notice that a new member has been added to the party! Whoa! Stranger Danger!!!  
He introduces himself as Dennis Von Reynolds, a local investigator, looking for some lost children. We bring him up to date on what's happened so far and get back to exploring.

We enter the in-suite bathroom and find it fancy, yet no water runs when we open the taps. Nothing of real value here, so back to the balcony we go, where we find Cuspertin opening the door to the north. Looks like it might be a storage room.  
As Dennis is about to investigate, a broom inside the room starts to vibrate quickly and hurls itself at him!

**Dennis' turn,** Disengages and runs out and away from the storage room closet. Cuspertin closes the door once Dennis is out.

We hear violent smacking against the door and keeps going and then stops.

  
***--- End of Combat ---***



  
We are at the top of the stairs. Dennis just happens to now be standing in front of a door that no one else sees. 

**Dennis**, roll perception as he puts his ear to the door  
12  
He doesn't hear much of anything. He then enters the room.

Directly across from the now opened door is another door and to his right a staircase that leads up.   
Nigellius kicks open one of the doors and enters. We see another door to the north, which leads to a room with a cradle in it. Gentle sobbing can be heard in the corner of the room. A ghostly figure of a woman is there, wearing plain tattered clothing. Slowly we back out and debate our choices here. It's no broom, but it ain't exactly human either. Ugh....well....come on boys....time to man up.

We enter the room, but geared towards a fight this time.  
She appears thin, translucent, perhaps a servant, paying no attention to us. Until Dennis speaks up and towards her. This spooks the ghost and it shrieks and vanishes. HOOOOOKAAAAY, lets just um....check this other door shall we...which leads to a balcony. A fine outline of the city can be seen through the yellow pee fog. Nothing to see here, so back to the cradle and ghost lady room we go.

**Dennis**, roll investigation on this room  
17  
nothing in particular. burnt cinders in the fireplace from a time ago and a broken cupboard.

  
our party begins to get a little cabin feverish here. A whole lot of nothing if you ask me, so they do what any other bunch of blokes would do. They go looking for a fight!  
We head back to the storage room where the broom is and Cuspertin opens the door with his sword ready, while Nigellius readies his Eldritch blast. This will be counted as a sneak attack round for the group, as the broom is dormant. 

  
  
**Cuspertin's turn**, roll for melee attack on the broom  
18  
**1 dmg**



**Nigellius' turn,** Cast Eldritch blast on the broom  
23  
hit  
**9 dmg**  
*splinters of wood come off it, but the broom springs to life* 



***Roll for initiative  (again)!!!***

Cuspertin 20  
Nigellius 6  
Dennis 14  
Broom 18

  
**Cuspertin's turn**, roll for melee with his mace attack on the broom  
20  
**5 dmg**  
The broom leaps towards Cuspertin but not before he turns this broom into small chopsticks**. ENEMY DOWN!!!**



***--- End of Combat --- (again)***



  


Dennis checks the storage room, thinking the broom was there to protect something. He finds sheets and covers and unused bar of soap.   
Cuspertin throws the fragments of the broom into the fireplace and lights it up. The room begins to get smoky, but Cuspertin's heart glows warm.   
Dennis leaves this room, heads to the south staircase and looks carefully at each step as he climbs. It leads to a wall which itself reveals another spiral staircase going further up. All follow Dennis' lead and come to a door...

The room is dark and dilapidated. It looks like a hallway. There looks to be 3 doors towards the east, one door to the west and another in a corner.  
So basically, 3 doors to our right, one door to our left and a small hallway in front.   


We forge down the hallway coming to the end and are forced to choose between doors on either side of us. We choose the right side and its another bedroom! Nothing of importance here....shall we open another door?! Sure, why not. Where is Frawd when we need him?!  
We exit and head to the door across our room and yet the door knob doesn't budge when we go to open it...Upon closer inspection, the lock is on the outside....Nigellius knocks on the door, but hears nothing. Dennis puts his ear against the door, hears nothing and picks the lock.

>*What you see before you is clearly a children room. There is a bed in either corner and sprawled in front of you are, what look very clearly, two small skeletons.* - DM Mark

**Flavor text**

>*The room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds, sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its side and a doll house that is a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing.*



**Cuspertin**, roll perception to figure out if these skeleton's resemble the children from outside.  
13  
they def have the same size and clothing 

Nigellius who isn't a doctor rolls Medicine to see if they died while the party was in the house.  
2  
Nigellius thinks they might still be alive. LOL

  
Dennis fixates on the Doll house. It's a clear replica of the mansion they are clearly in.

**Dennis**, roll investigation on the doll house.  
as he touches the house, two ghostly figures approach Dennis.  


They are very clearly the version of the children we first saw outside asking for our help.  




>*""Please sir...we've been trapped in here. We haven't eaten in so long. There is a monster in the basement and our little brother is missing.""*- ghostly girl





The party converse with the ghostly children. We learn that the younger brother 'Walter' was born sickly, but beyond all of that, they just end up repeating what they told us outside.

Cuspertin dusts off his pleats and heads out the door.  
But as he does that, the ghostly girl screams, 'please don't leave us!' and jumps towards Cuspertin.

**Cuspertin,** roll Charisma save  
9  
He feels uncomfortable, she grabs onto him and sinks into his skin. He hears a voice in his head, repeating not to leave the little girl alone and how he must save the family. Cuspertin is possessed.  
  
The little ghostly boy then lunges towards Nigellius   
**Nigellius,**  roll Charisma save  
7  
He feels a hand reach towards his mind, he too is possessed.

Cuspertin now has the urge that he is in charged and Nigellius is overcome with a sense of fear. 



Cuspertin stomps back to the main area. Two doors which they have already investigated but two more to the west which they haven't. 

We open one of the doors on the west and we are now in a room. Furniture is stacked about, covered in blankets. Dennis moves to the middle of the room and lifts up some of the cloths.   
He pulls that down and what appears looks like dress body mannequin. Cuspertin opens a window on the west side of the room and then opens the door on the east side of the room. However this door looks like is was recently hidden behind some wall that no longer is there.

CALLBACK

Remember the loud sounds we heard in the previous episode when we were reading the deadmans letter? Welp, we suspect that noise was coming from here, with a wall moving away to reveal the door.

Because I'm also a coffee drinker, this usually results in me going to a nearby coffee shop as the ""Destination"" for my morning walk. I do, however, literally have Espresso AND Coffee At Home. If I go to Dunkin, which is very convenient where I live, I only buy a cup of espresso and bring it home to mix it with my own oatmilk, as a cost saving measure. I recognize this is an ""unnecessary"" expenditure. It would be nice to eliminate or reduce this needless cost. 

That all said, it is tough for me to get up and get motivated to go outside without a specific ""Destination."" If I just get up and walk to the park and back... there is no material gain or reward, lmao.

As a disclaimer, I have never drank coffee in my life aside from a sip or two - it’s just not for me, I do not like it no matter how I’ve tried it.
Despite this, my boyfriend, does. I know his order for his specific preferred chain, but I was wanting to purchase some coffee as a gift for him.
My question is this: how exactly do I make coffee? I’ve only ever had to use instant coffee. 
From what I’ve gathered, you can get the beans themselves or you can get them pre-ground(?) which I think is the better option, as I don’t have a coffee machine and neither does he. I imagine I’ll need some kind of equipment, but I can’t really afford a coffee machine. I’ve seen something called a french press? Will this be any good?

As a lurker and someone who doesn’t engage as often as I should, this has truly been a great way to read and learn and keep myself to the course over the last few months. Wanted to do this write up for those on the fence about this and maybe offer a different perspective than what I see on the majority of threads. This is more about creating habits and sticking to a routine / changing your perspective than about the tirtz… for anyone that cares! 

About me: Raised in family with no healthy relationships with food, no access to healthy foods, mainly take out and dining out of fast foods and places where over eating was the main goal to get the “bang for your buck”. 

Despite that, grew up very active (martial arts, school sports, competition teams outside of regular season etc. So I was able to “outrun” a lot of my early weight gain even with the terrible habits. Once I stopped school sports and/ or got injured growing up I would put on a lot of weight and then lose it a little when I got active again, but always maintained a lot of the chub. The sports I was involved in also required “weight cuts” where I would spend a season cutting down and then binge eating after it was over because I had overdone it during those times. 
Fast forward to college and after starting my career I definitely spent my early years enjoying alcohol, eating out and thus put on a good 50-70LBS of fat. 
I definitely maintained some bit of muscle and athleticism and could gain / lose 10-20lbs at a time here and there over the last few years but nothing that stuck mainly because of my relationship and mindset around food. 

Fast forward to about 6 months ago - I decided to visit a health coach in the town that I live. 
He was very straight forward about my blood pressure being high for my age, weight not being where it needed to be and the blood work not being at optimal levels. 
I opted to try a 3 month program they were offering that came with a 3 month supply of tirtz, weekly weigh ins, health coach / diet coach sessions and follow up visits with the Dr. 

Below are my weekly weigh ins:

Sept 29 - 215

Oct 15th (today) - 210

A couple of things to note: weeks 1-4 were amazing - the side effects were only that of loss of appetite. I started noticing the hunger return week 2/3 but stayed the course. Felt like I had figured it out in month two on the 5 & was very consistent in the weight loss and month 3 is where I started playing around with the dose to get the most out of the final month. Happy to answer any additional questions around this. 

Now, the most important thing about my journey personally was fixing my mindset around food. I have always been a snacker and overeater, but during this I was able to control those urges and set good healthy processes with how I eat, when I eat and how much I eat. 

Throughout this entire journey and still today I do Intermittent fasting: 16 hour fast, 8 hour eating window. I do last meal by 8PM and first meal is 12PM. I understand this doesn’t work for everyone, but just sharing my journey. 
I also walked every single morning to start my day and continue to do this today. I love getting my body moving and getting morning sun and a deep stretch after before starting the day. 
I mainly did body weight exercises along with the walks with my sets of pushups, sit ups, squats, and some very basic kettlebell movements. 
My biggest thing was just getting into a routine and making sure I was hitting the 10K steps every day even on “rest days” and getting that fasted cardio in. 

My diet was very basic and is something I have as a non negotiable for myself now: nothing on my plate I can’t name / single ingredient foods. I mainly mean prepped on Sundays, chicken, beef, sweet potatoes, rice and messed around with a bunch of salads. 

There were a few weekends where we were out of town or somewhere away from home and I would indulge in one cheat meal or whatever but the IF really helped this as I feel like breakfast is the easiest one to make bad choices at and the rest of the day spiral… 

Anyway, been off the tirtz for about 3/4 weeks now and have maintained this system of IF, walking every morning, black coffee if I am too hungry, only Whole Foods and stopping food intake by 8PM and feel like it is working. I am still dropping weight at about a 1.5LB/ week mark and plan to get to my GW by year end. 

I know I am younger than a lot of posters on here and it’s definitely easier for me, but wanted to share my journey and I am very open to answering any extra questions anyone may have. 

TLDR: Create realistic habits you can stick to while on Tirtz that doing anything else feels weird!

I was new to the city I was living in with no real family to speak of and I met him.  He was charming for about 1 week and I moved in with him right away because I was so lonely and scared.  It started the first weekend I lived with him.  I went out on a saturday morning to get us breakfast and coffees before he woke up.  When I got back he screamed at me for not answering a text he sent that I didn't bother to answer because I was 2 mins away from walking back into the apartment.  It was a red flag but I was just hoping it was a grumpy mood.  The next week was terrifying!  It started with him punching pillows and screaming over dumb stuff like video games or a conversation with one of his relatives, and progressed to me telling I am going for a walk I need a break from you and that was the first time he threw me to the floor and spit on me and said you don't leave to take a walk I leave to take a walk and kicked my leg as he stormed out of the apartment.  He apologized when he came back and even faked tears as he would continue over and over after every incident.  I f ing hated him but I had no job and my savings were running low in a new city.  The hitting, spitting, and screaming wasn't even close to the worst part.  The worst was when he would go out drinking with his loser friends drinking and come back to the apartment and I would have a choice of either him stripping my clothes off me and throwing me on the bed to grunt on top of me while I thought about how I could kill myself when he finished, or I could tell him no where he would punch me in my body until he got tired.  The choice became 2 mins of being raped or 10 mins of being punched.  I mostly chose him grunting on top of me for a minute or 2.  Until 1 night I felt so distant from my actual body and who I used to be that I turned defiant and charged head on into what I knew I was going to be a brutal beating but this time it got to a point where I thought he was going to kill me, and I poked him in the eye while I am convinced he was going to choke me until I was unconscious or dead.  I poked him in the eye to get free and ran out of the apartment in just my flip flops, sweat pants and t-shirt.  People ask me why I didnt call the police?  I don't really have a good answer for that other than fear.  So the police come and arrest him, then what?  His parents bail him out and I am in his legal apartment.  I felt like the only way out was to go homeless or just figure out a painless way to kill myself.  I have never been a god person but for the first time in my life I feel like someone was watching out for me because I had a chance meeting with an angel.  I was in my car crying looking in the mirror trying to stop the bleeding above my eyebrow and looking at the marks on my neck when I decided to get out and smoke a cigarette and try and take some deep breaths.  When a gentleman came walking towards me texting on his phone and walked by me and then a second after he walked past me I heard a soft voice say ""excuse me maam.  Are you okay?""  I turned around and looked at him with tears coming down my face and he had noticed the blood trickle from my eyebrow that I dont even know how I got.  It just happened in my struggle to get free.  I looked at him and couldnt really see his face.  He took a step back towards me and took the hood from his hoodie off his head.  I dont know why I decided to put trust in him and let my guard down at that moment.  I think it was because he had a very kind handsome face and said to me ""You are bleeding are you ok?""  I just lost it and started crying uncontrolable.  Most men probably would have run in the opposite direction but he didnt do that.  He asked me if I felt comfortable enough to sit down on a bench that was near by and told me to hold on just a minute and came back with a bottle of water from his car and I think some napkins.  He asked me if it was ok if he sat down next to me and I shook my head yes.  He sat down on the far side of the bench and got me to take some deep breaths and I just spilled my guts over the next hour.  He just listened and I remember after an hour of telling him everything I had been through over the last few years since I graduated highschool up into the last 6 months of hell. I couldnt believe this stranger was sitting there showing me more kindness in 1 hour than I had seen in all of the last 4 years.  He calmly said to me ""I am so sorry for what you have been through.  Nobody deserves the abuse you have suffered and you have some really big decisions that are coming over the next few days.  But right now I think we should get you checked out by a doctor or nurse.  I know someone that can definitley help you"" (it was him that could help me but he didnt want to say that at the time for fear of me being afraid of help from a man)  He excused himself and I heard him make a phone call.  He came back and asked me if I was comfortable walking a couple of blocks with him to see his friend that was a nurse.  She was waiting for us on the stoop of her apartment.  She talked to him and gave me a quick look over and said to me after she asked my name and she told me that I needed to go to the ER because she was convinced that I had a broken rib.  He asked me if I felt comfortable riding to the hospital with his nurse friend or did I want him to call an ambulance.  I agreed to ride with Shauna his friend. I was at the ER for what felt like hours and hours while my phone blew up with texts and missed calls from him.  No longer were they apology texts though.  Now they were just straight threats of throwing my stuff on the street.  Shauna the nurse had left and I fully expected at this point (3am) that the doctors were going to just give me some literature on domestic abuse or the name of a counselor and pat me on the head and say good luck.  The nurse came in and told me there was gentleman asking if he could come back and visit me to see how I was doing.  I right away thought it was the monster and stiffened up and felt adrenaline rush through my body.  I thought to myself he can't beat the shit out of me in the ER in front of the doctors and nurses I might as well face him now.  Instead the man that showed me so much kindness walked into the room.  I couldnt believe he was still there waiting for me!  He asked me how I was feeling?  I said to him ""I cant believe that you waited this whole time for me"". He brushed that comment off and asked me if I had a plan for what was next?  Because ""Going back there isn't an option.  From what you told me and judging by your injuries its only going to get worse, and I bet if you check your phone he has sent apology texts hasn't he?""  I shooked my head no ""Just threats"".  He said ""So you know you cant go back right?""  I shook my head yes ""All my stuff is there though and I can only afford a hotel for maybe 1 or 2 nights but even my car is better than this.""  I was just staring straight ahead as I said it, and he calmly said to me ""Good that is the first step, but I wanted to hear you say it.  You let me worry about getting your stuff and I have somewhere you can stay with other young woman who are going through the same thing you are.  But for right now I bet you are probably hungry I would imagine?""  After I got discharged it was almost dawn and he asked me if I was comfortable enough to walk over to a diner for breakfast.  He took me over to the diner and we sat in a half empty diner at around 4:30am in the morning, and after we ordered our breakfast I remember starting to think clearer and I looked at him and said ""Why do you care so much?  Are you some guy that gets his kicks off of down and out girls.  You feel too nice to me are you some kind of sicko?""  He chuckled and told me ""we are all sicko's but no my mental problems have more to do with childhood and a certain type of self loathing.""  We talked for an hour as we had breakfast and for the first time in a very long time fear wasn't pumping through me.  He just had a way about him but I asked him again ""Why do you care?  I see you have a wedding ring on so I am assuming someone can tolerate your ass.  What is your deal?""  He again chuckled and told me ""Lets just say I have a special hatred for people who bully and take away the innocence and fairness of a child or a woman""  I looked him and said ""You think women are innocent,,,, oh boy?""  He chuckled again and said ""I do yes.  Women are what is right with the world and men who kick the shit out of them are what is wrong with the world, and it happens far too often in this hell hole we call Earth.""  To make a very long story somewhat shorter that man who happened to just run into me at my lowest point in my life was my angel.  He gave me life!  He gave me a job, which gave me friends in a new city, which gave me happiness and most importantly he gave me safety from a monster that I know would have beaten, raped, and most likely have killed me!  He sat and listened to me as I cried my eyes out over and over about my nightmares.  And he did it all with the expectation of nothing back from me.  I thought I was in love with him even though he was 20 years older than me and I even tried to pursue him sexually in the following weeks after he moved me to the safe house.  I had never been rejected by a man before and I am certainly not bragging but I know that guys find me attractive.  I threw myself at him and he softly and gently told me ""No you have been through far too much sweetheart to have a sexual relationship with anyone right now.  You have to get better before you go down that path, and besides I am married.  She can't stand the site of me but I am married.""  I swear if I had 1 wish, it wouldnt be world peace, it wouldnt be winning the lottery, it wouldn't be Channing Tatum.... It would be that every person woman or man who was being beaten and abused by a partner mentally or physically had what I had..  An ANGEL!!! Sent to me by something or someone.  He saved my life!  Every time I tell him that he says the same damn thing.  ""I didnt save you sweetheart.  You saved you and dont you ever forget that.""  I tear up just thinking about the empathy he showed for a complete and utter stranger who was severely wounded and at the end of her rope.  I love that man forever!",1,1729014402.0,domesticviolence,2,1.0,False

36th of Anael, the first month of snow.

Nightfall

 

Grendel and the children departed the worksite at dusk, along with the other workers, leaving three new watchmen too look after the well. When they arrived at the tent camp near the beach, Grendel was plucked from the children by Lady Brianna and dragged to their tent to bathe and to dress in “respectable” clothing to go and meet the city lord.

“Do I really need to go?” Grendel asked from behind the bathing curtain as he scrubbed himself. “I don’t have anything to contribute to the conversation.”

“You say that almost every time we go to one of these functions.” Bri replied, “Then you get yourself involved in a political or economic argument with some noble or another and make enough sense that people actually listen to you.”

“It’s not my fault they are so stupid.” Grendel groused, “That also means that they notice me. That’s bad for business.”

“But good for gaining information. If you plan on working your way up in your world, you will need both skills.” Maxwell said as he strolled into the tent. “Now stop arguing with your mot— with Bri and finish up in there. We have to be there soon.”

-

The great hall of the lord was warm and well lit, candelabra, sconces and chandeliers filled with candles everywhere. The tapestries on the walls looked freshly laundered, and the collections of weapons and fishing accoutrement that hung between them looked freshly cleaned and oiled. The smell of fresh fall herbs hung in the air, and Max noticed the diffusers cleverly concealed in alcoves behind the larger display pieces.

The great hall of the lord was warm and well lit, candelabra, sconces and chandeliers filled with candles everywhere. The tapestries on the walls looked freshly laundered, and the collections of weapons and fishing accoutrement that hung between them looked freshly cleaned and oiled. The smell of fresh fall herbs hung in the air, and Max noticed the diffusers cleverly concealed in alcoves behind the larger display pieces.

After taking a long inhalation, Bri said “This place smells wonderful! I wonder what the occasion is?”

“I believe it is a charity ball for reconstruction.” Max said, still looking at the chandeliers. “The lord could sell some of the decorations and make more than enough to repair the city, but I think he wants to get the other nobles and the merchants to assist.”

A man in court attire stepped towards the three, “You are exactly correct, lord Smithson.” The man smiled a smile that barely touched his eyes. “His lordship decided, after he met with you, that the best way to secure funds was to throw a “Charity Ball” with a sealed bid auction. The results of which will be announced at the end of the ball.”

“If this is a charity ball, why didn’t we have to pay to attend?” Grendel asked from behind the man.

“You move quickly, master Grendel.” The man gave another smile. “But to answer your question, his lordship considered it, but decided that there were some who should not be required to pay an admission fee. Something about not wanting to cause an incident.”

Grendel grunted in response.

“But please, allow me to introduce myself, I am Adrian Welsman, the lords…left hand.”

“Ah.” Max smiled. “The spymaster, assassin, and general doer of untoward feats.”

“You are correct, as expected of one of your…station.” Adrian said with his first actual smile. “I have made it my mission for the last few days to find out as much about you and yours as I could.”

“Did you learn anything interesting?” Max asked, returning the smile.

“Your roots run deep, and while you take absolutely no advantage of it, you have your fingers in so many pies, that it would take me more than a decade of exclusive work to untangle your connections. Did you know that you are now the major stock holder in National Coffee?”

“Really?” Max stared into space for a minute. “All I did was loan the company some money when I needed coffee delivered to the shop back when I owned the bakery…”

“Yes. The Loan.” Adrian grimaced. “The loan of one hundred Demonian golden heretics; a small fortune then, just as it is now. The loan that enabled the company to monopolize the coffee crop for thirteen years. The loan that established their trade empire. The loan that scared the board enough that they forced the growers, the other importers, and the roasters to conform to a sustainable and fair coffee trade. A standard that continued even in the worst of times. A standard that still exists today.”

“It was just a small loan!” Max argued.

“A small loan for you, yes. For them? For them it was the saving grace of their company.”

“They paid it back in stocks. The loan doesn’t exist anymore.”

“Do you have any idea how much those stocks are worth?” Adrian asked, rubbing his face.

“A hundred gold?”

“Fifty-three thousand gold. Each.” Adrian answered. “You own more than half of the world’s largest trading companies.”

“Huh.” Max shrugged his shoulders. For her part, Brianna’s face went pale. “Well, it has been nice to meet you, Mr. Adrian Welsman. I will keep an eye on your advancement.”

The party walked away from Adrian, who stood stalk still, eyes bulging, and face turned pale. “I’m doomed. Just like they said. I am doomed.” He whispered.

Bri looked at Max after a few minutes, “Are there any other investments that I should take into account?”

“…um… I was working as a baker at the time, and had regular access to coin. There was a bottler of beer that I loaned money too. And that wolfman. Oh, the Ratkin took out a loan to buy some new equipment for their sanitation service, they were expanding to the surrounding communities you see, and needed new wagons and such. I don’t remember what the wolfman was up to, something about cattle breading?” Max shook his head. “I have all the paperwork somewhere…”

“Is there anything else?” Bri arched a well-manicured eyebrow at Max.

“I don’t remember off the top of my head. I was mostly busy making sure the local hoodlums weren’t causing trouble for the legitimate businesses in town, or the surrounding communities.” Max shrugged again. “There is a ledger of the loans, and repayments?”

Bri sighed, and slowly shook her head. “Husband dearest, just because it’s “just money” to you, doesn’t mean it isn’t important to the big picture. You do realize that National Coffee has a yearly budget on par to most nations, do you not?”

“…they were just a couple of guys trying to make a living selling “java juice” back then. Ben and James were wonderful guys. Very loving.” Max’s eyes lost focus, thinking back. “Then there was that brewing machine I helped them invent. Well, by invent, I mean they brought me the idea, and I helped set them up with craftsmen and capital to pay them. The steam from that machine was godly! And what it could do to cream! Truly a work of art.”

Grendel’s eyes almost popped from his head, “You mean the MX Ex-Press-O machine was your doing?”

“Not really? I just worked on the original design. The crafters did all the fine tuning and manufacturing. That’s why I’m not on the patent paperwork. I barely had anything to do with it. Or the semi-automated roaster. Jessi had the idea for preset, but adjustable, settings on the roaster. Much better than my three-position design. I wonder what she did with the rest of her life?”

“Jessi? As in the original owner of J&M Roasters International?” Grendel asked. “The manufacturer of the finest coffee equipment on the continent, and probably the world?”

“…probably?”

Holy hecking hells bells. Its been a bit, huh? My week of vacation went on for almost two weeks. Mom is much better. She actually did a ""Road Scholar"" trip to Illinois to learn about Lincoln, our last ""good"" president. But then, what do I know?

Anyway, there was no wifi at the cabin, so I didn't get anything uploaded while I was gone. The next chapter will be out on Thursday, and then two more next week to catch up. I wish I was able (it's a mental thing) to wright a chapter ahead. For whatever reason, I seem to only be able to catch up, not get ahead. :(

Anyway, Thursday's chapter will have all of my begging for money links. Tomorrow at O-Dark-Early, I will be duck hunting for the first time with a buddy of mine. I hope we can shoot our limit. I hope we get some geese too. :)

See y'all Thursday!

The chapter links will either be updated later today, or on Thursday. Sorry.",6,1729014392.0,HFY,5,0.8,False

they asked for a dp but the store manager insisted on making sure that the issue was fixed, so my money would not be wasted. fine. they did stuff which took weeks yet again. in the end, they were not able to fix my laptop, returned the dp i sent prior, and apologized.

it's been months since then and my m1 is on stand-by and idk what to do with it. i could have it fixed but it'd be really costly. i could sell it but i've been told that it will be of very little value.

it's really heartbreaking, what happened. it was my first big-ish purchase with money from my first job fresh out of uni.

I have the sage bambino since a month and I cant get one single good shot out of it. All my shots taste extremely sour like acid. I also went to my favorite coffee place and tried their espresso just to see if I am going insane, but there it tastes lovely. 

I bought all kinds of different beans, medium and dark. I have since gone through 5-6 bags but every single shot is only drinkable with a lot of milk.

I tried changing the dose all the way from 12 g to 22 g, pulled 1:1 up to 1:4, adjusted the grind size from 8 to 20 on my baratza esp encore, tried pulling an empty shot with and without the pressurized basket to preheat the machine, tried preheating by letting the steam wand run for a little bit. Every single shot tastes the same. Sour and undrinkable. And its not like ""yeah it tastes a little sour afterwards"". It is ""Oh my god I need to spit it out right now"".

1g4dfaj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1g4dfaj/suspicion_of_autism/,Suspicion of autism...,"Hello, all.

 I am a 47 year-old man who has recently become aware that I may be on the autism spectrum. I had never considered it until recently when my first girlfriend (when I was 30) and I reconnected on the phone and she told me that she had been clinically diagnosed a few years ago, and that it was such a relief to have ""a reason"" for how awkward and at odds with people she had been her entire life. She also mentioned that she thought that I should be tested, as she saw/sees so many traits or behaviors in me that seem to point to it.

 Again, I had never considered it, as I thought all of my ""quirks"" were results of having been sexually abused when I was younger. The thing is that I have had therapy for this and learned many tools to grow through it, and for many years now it really hasn't been a main source of my problems. That said, I have wondered after so much self-work why I *still* feel like an ""alien"" in society; why I can't ever seem to make/keep friends; why I can't find a romantic relationship; why I can't find a band to play with; why I end up declining going out if I *am* ever invited out, even though I feel so lonely. I spend more time with animals than people. They seem to like and understand me very well.

 So I began looking into it/myself, and I must admit the more I research, the calmer I've become about being me (whoever that is) - just seeing others who have felt such similar feelings has given me a modicum of peace.

 It wasn't until I read about masking that I began to wonder if I'd been lying to myself and others about who I [thought that I] was my whole life. 

 So I began compiling a list of these ""quirks"", and if it's alright to share them here, I would like to - and I'd appreciate any thoughts you all may have to offer. I hope that in doing so I will not be offending anyone.

 Here is the list as it stands today:

 • putting something down in the exact position that it was found (dust marks, indentations, between two other things, or from memory)

• putting things down softly (i.e. coffee mug), closing doors softly

• walking softly, being hyper-aware to remain innocuous as a neighbor or houseguest or second-floor tenant

• cleaning a host's kitchen rather than socializing at parties I've been to

• always putting items back in exactly the same place/way I found them every time 

• hanging clothes on walls instead of folding them; arranging by color/type of clothing

• one day my clothes feel perfect, but the next the very same outfit wouldn't ""fit"", and so oftentimes I wouldn't leave the house

• obsession with patterns/seeing faces in everything/numbers/license plates (e.g. one + one = 3 + 3 = 6 = six = 3 = three = 5 = five = 4 = four = 4)

• weaving window/windshield spots over and under things on the street/highway/interstate (or things in foreground over and under things in the background)

• taking things so literally that it is impossible to fill out certain forms online or even taking tests (like the online RAADS, etc.) because I don't want to lie to the test/feeling like the test is judging me

• preferring to write down instructions/have them written so that I do something exactly as it was asked

• seeing infinity symbol/triangle/lightning bolt/circle depending on the kind of breathing I'm doing

• obsession with anti-racism/sexism/misogynoir (I can go on and on and on)

• obsession with over-explaining so that I am sure I'm understood and/or not offending anyone or making myself look bad

• obsession with making people feel comfortable/safe around me (dating especially)

• preferring to sit in my own space rather than next to people 

• saying the thing others won't (which sometimes people like and sometimes they don't)

• wiping hand down my face/shaking my head violently/repeatedly when stressed

• spreading my fingers as wide as they can go when I'm talking 

• periodic tics like small head jerks when stressed

 • critiquing commercials/shows/movies for disruption of continuities 

• hating CBS's ""graininess""/certain types of cinematography or colorization

• synesthesia (mirror, and color/scenes have tastes and smells)

• connecting dots, both literally and figuratively 

• obsession with not stepping on cracks/certain tiles, and obsession with gait length (to avoid as many cracks as possible), or stepping into certain ""complete"" patterns (like a diamond made by leaves) which I feel a ""power up"" from (like in a video game)

• obsession with bathroom hygiene (both 1 and 2)

• obsession with cleaning/arranging/notating/filing/alphabetizing

• obsession with ordering tasks so that they are completed efficiently 

• repeating myself in conversations but being unaware of it (so I am told)

• I think I  am cool, but I can't seem to make/keep friends 

• being ""too intense"" to people 

• difficulty in reading fiction (except for 'Illusions' by Richard Bach, which I've read over 150 times)

• obsession with appearance/practicing expressions/poses in the mirror

• realizing that I'm maybe not sitting correctly in public 

• talking to myself out loud to ""coach"" myself when I'm too stressed

• eye contact obsession (too much, not enough?) except with people I really know

• I was a talented visual artist, but gave up drawing because I would start over with a new sheet of paper if I made even one error

• obsession with making sure people actually like my company vs tolerating it because I am helpful person

• patience in relationships (cutting people off if they don't respond as I'd like them to, or perception that they didn't)

• hating certain textures (clothing, foods, etc.)

I’ve seen recent questions on how to break in to the field, so I won’t bother asking about it but I wonder what are some good ways to network with people in med sales? So far, no luck connecting on LinkedIn.

Warning—this is a long one.

Here's the situation: I work from home. My day typically starts around 8:45 when I make breakfast, sometimes for both of us if he wants to eat at home. By 9:30, I’m at my desk working. I get a 30-minute lunch break, and I take a few quick 5-10 minute breaks here and there to make a coffee or grab a snack. I finish up by 6:00 PM and then start cooking dinner.

I’ve been working from home for two years, but I recently switched jobs. The new one is more demanding, and I’ve actually been warned that if I don’t step it up, I could lose my job. My previous job was more flexible, so I had time to juggle work and chores. Now, I can barely manage to make coffee, and sometimes I even forget to eat lunch.

The conflict started when he kept coming home to unwashed dishes and no dinner ready, which I admit is on me. It’s my responsibility, and I wasn’t keeping up but I wasn't putting it on him either, since I was just leaving the cleaning for later. But then I started to think about the bigger picture. Aside from cooking, I also do the laundry since it’s easier for me while I’m home, usually during work breaks. We have a cleaner, but that doesn’t cover everything.

He started complaining that I barely do any housework, leave the place a mess, and don’t cook. Then things escalated—he pointed out that he contributes more financially, so I have to be willing to contribute more to our comfort. He’s even suggested I wake up earlier so I can cook everything for the day before I start work, meaning he’d come home to a ready dinner, which is really important to him.

To be clear, it’s not like he does nothing. He washes dishes, occasionally does the laundry, and stops by the store on his way home. But I feel like it would be fair to track who’s doing more chores to make sure it’s balanced. We both work 40h a week, but for some reason, I'm the most tired one. He thinks that's petty.

I've been dating my partner for a year and a half - he has 2 kids (a 15 year old stepson and a 9 year old daughter) and I have one 11 year old daughter. We recently moved in together and the family dynamics when we have the kids seems to be working.. but dealing with his ex, has been a terrible situation. 

Unfortunately, due to the timing of when we met (neither of us were planning on getting into a relationship), I went through his divorce with him. To keep it short, the divorce process was not easy.. and she was downright mean, to not only him, but about me - never to my face. But my partner has this idea of how he would like to co-parent with her. So, we tried on numerous occasions to be inclusive and understanding to what she was also going through. Until about 4 months ago.. when one of her outbursts brought her banging on our door at 10PM at night (luckily my daughter wasn't home), we opted not to answer.. Then the messages were coming to me about how terrible of dad he was and trying to tell me how we should be parenting in our home. Aside from me texting her trying to set up a coffee date with her to get to know each other, she's never messaged me. The rage that i allowed to be typed on that phone is my responsibility.. but she kept it going by messaging him and threatening to tell me things to cause a fight in our relationship and that was the last straw for him. He moved to email only and she was blocked. She then started including the kids in her games.. she got her son to come into the house and write ""(Name) was here"". Non-stop nonsense... But, we had put a boundary in place - so be it. The distance helped and we started to see less nonsense. 

Well, about a month ago, my partner got a generic apology from her - and now all boundaries are off. They had discussed doing a joint Halloween, which I got invited too. But now they planned to have dinner with the kids on a random thursday, which I got invited too.

I've looked through some of the other posts for this question and not sure any quite hit at my specific situation: 

* I am getting married and likely moving to New Orleans some time next year to buy our first home
* I have over 5 years experience working in a variety of shops (mostly 3rd wave/indie roasters) 
* I've lived in Nola before and have a pretty good grasp on the market 
* Would like for it to be a coffee shop that transitions to a wine bar in the evening (liquor license requirement acknowledged)
* I am ok with a longer runway due to being in an ok position with my current work - would just prefer to one day work for myself in an area I know well and loved working in

My questions are mainly around expected financial commitments. While some of this could be rent dependent, what should I look to have ready up front? I have an OK grasp on the equipment, inventory and other costs but what should I expect for labor? 

Should I focus on developing sourcing from farms first, or pay for 3rd party beans until I develop those partnerships and can roast independently (strictly from a financial perspective)?

I was already quite exhausted and was basically caught offguard  a bit. In hindsight I felt the conversation was one sided, I was oversharing, etc. The usual autistic ""have too much good faith in people"" stuff I guess. I felt betrayed and very anxious.

I was very upset. So much in fact I called in for a night stay at my local psychiatric clinic. It was also my first stay and an attempt to not make my situation any worse. I can't say the stay was very relaxing.. people in the clinic were arguiing (which I could mostly ignore), there were some usual pricks too. But ah well, I tried to sleep and went home.

The next day I was still very frustrated by everything. At home I tried to block as much sensory stimuli as I could. At night I felt panicky again, so I took some meds to calm down and sleep. Next day, rinse and repeat. But this time I took meds during the day so I could basically sleep all afternoon..

Come monday, and I was still upset. I could finally talk to my psychologist. Last night I was starting to feel alright again. I played some games and chatted with some friends. At night I got a migraine though, and woke up with a nightmare. Only slept for 3 hours. I still felt quite energized though. I put on my coffee grinder, and the noise didn't bother me at all. I turned up my bluetooth speaker, didn't bother me at all. But any bullshit that people are pulling, no way. 

So I went to my psychologist appointment. He could see I was very worked up. But when I said I feel so hyposensitive to everything right now, he looked very confused. I said I don't care about sound (turn it up), I don't care about people's opinion (everyone can f- off that argues against me), etc. I hate these kinds of irritable moods, as I said I'm basically kicking against everything in my surroundings (figuratively) but it's not satisfying and I only feel more agitated usually.

Like I can understand people get irritable from too little sleep. But I was irritable but also in good spirits. Normally when I have my meltdowns or shtudowns, I feel my brain has gone totally mush. My sight is a haze, sounds don't process, and I get disoriented. Also, its now Tuesday, so its been like 4 days? Of which I slept like most of the weekend?  I'm so confused.

I told him that he was being mean and I didn't understand it, he was really rude and hurtful in response and I said you made me walk all the way down to your mother's car but I'm parked on the other side of the road and it's cold out, and he yelled okay. I'll walk you to your car and then started walking aggressively in that direction and would turn around yell Keep up. I didn't follow him and he disappeared. Apparently he made it back to his house. 

He is saying that these outbursts are PTSD related, But I think they also have to do with his ocpd. I don't know. Has anybody ever experienced anything like this?? How do you handle it? ",2,1729012060.0,LovedByOCPD,0,1.0,False

1g4cr9f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheQueen0fNowhere/comments/1g4cr9f/predicting_deltarune_part_4_off/,Predicting Deltarune: Part 4 - OFF,"**Hand of God**

So, for some reason the mother of [a sick child named Hugo](https://imgur.com/a/tjwNbaN) supposedly [had godlike powers that would have helped fix everything after this unspecified apocalypse…](https://imgur.com/a/3yJUtXq) just accept this premise.
But it appears that the child was gifted with the powers of creation in her stead and [since his real mother had seemingly gone missing,](https://imgur.com/a/Aic6gJ8) he used it to [create a powerful being called “The Queen”,](https://imgur.com/a/cNr0n5Y) who basically acts as a replacement for her, [despite failing at her job as caretaker and being absent,](https://imgur.com/a/6nTQgUo) just like his real mom did.
Along with [3 people of evidently lesser power who would later become the guardians, they all planned to rebuild the world again as an utopia,](https://imgur.com/a/JibzZfJ) which would end up being the awful world we see in the game, with the Queen being tasked to take care of Hugo but instead overseeing said world as you already saw.
Now, while all that apocalypse talk and rebuilding world stuff alone should start to invoke my Deltarune rebirth theory, there’s of course still more to all this.

It can be inferred that all your actions of purifying the zones might be reversible.
The world the game resides in [was already created from the ashes,](https://i.imgur.com/B7kFpAZ.png) so it’s not unreasonable to assume that the blank white slate you’re turning it into can be molded into another world yet again.
Which is why the final chapter doesn’t just lead you and the Batter to [doing what you’ve done the entire time by killing Hugo,](https://imgur.com/a/sMNoPTe) the child who seems to have the powers of creation and is technically the last guardian, but also going a step further by [pulling the plug to put an end to everything once and for all:](https://imgur.com/a/74jq8ae)
The switch you reach every run, the remaining choice only being [to finish the job or not.](https://i.imgur.com/7908wgA.png)
Mortis Ghost [considers the Judge ending to be hopeful, while indicating that you could indeed live on in that ending, but there’s nothing remaining after the official ending where the Batter wins.](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=19012) *(5:16:52 - 5:17:29)*
Which all very much seems to support the idea that purifying the zones would NOT have been enough to wipe the world out, and the “hope” comes from simply not flipping the switch and leaving the possibility open of the world being rebuilt.
So by all means, it’s very likely here that the Batter wasn’t simply getting rid of just the current corrupted world by purifying it, but stopping a cycle from recurring by flipping that switch, ensuring that no further worlds could be created again, like it’s already happened, and [everything is plunged into nothingness,](https://imgur.com/a/a1NTGm3) which, to remind you, [is an actual place that the Batter also came from](https://imgur.com/a/xJXqg1n) and what [the kingdom was apparently built upon to begin with.](https://imgur.com/a/P8pivJN)

Yes… “Nothingness”, used as a place where erased things seem to go, is very curious in the context of Deltarune/Undertale, where things that have been deleted or died also appear to end up in some kind of dark void, [as seen with Flowey, Chara, Gaster and others,](https://imgur.com/a/vzKsdy7) which I’ll all elaborate on a bit more at a later point.
Anyway, since it’s clear that the predecessor to the OFF world was also destroyed through whatever means, and this current world is already horrible again, the Batter essentially put a stop to a potential loop by flipping that switch.
A loop in which this world would have been recreated and destroyed over and over again, with people making the same kinds of mistakes, something that seems intended as those mistakes the new world makes are [clearly based on and repeated from real life things that the dev had problems with,](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=7955) *(2:12:35 - 2:13:42)* even if they’re often [rather simplistic and surface-level to him.](https://imgur.com/a/4CjRkB5)

Now, in relation to Deltarune, I first want to bring up the loop thing.
Because… of course… I did bring up [the idea of Deltarune having a self-inflicted “meta” time loop very early on towards the end of my original rebirth theory,](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/qjum9m/world_of_hopes_and_dreams_megatheory_part_3/) a concept I’ve consistently held onto at the back of my head and expanded, seeing how it just slides in effortlessly with basically any theory I come up with.
It’s not like the one in OFF, but who would I be if I didn’t mention this obvious connection?
But the other stuff that ties the games together, everything related to the world… wowie.
I mean, I already talked about it earlier, didn’t I?
I think the world ending is inevitable in Deltarune, aka. the Roaring, and what will happen afterwards is the diverging factor.
And my theory very much strongly lines up with OFF here.
Having the faith, hopes, and dreams to create a new world from the rubble, or having no hope in existence itself and pulling the plug, plunging everything into nothing.
With a split in Deltarune being the characters who wish for a new world, and the Angel that wishes for eternal night.
So yes, I think in the end… Noelle’s and the Batter’s motivations will be the same, putting this world and its people out of their misery.
Which is absolutely scary to think about and not a parallel I thought I’d make when I started this… and I’m not even done yet with those two either, more on that in a moment.

What’s even more exhilarating about the “two sides” thing is the way that this could be presented as a choice in Deltarune.
I mentioned it earlier in a cryptic way, but there aren’t any choices you can make to influence the Batter’s actions, unlike Undertale where it’s all about your choices.
But the thing is that the Batter needs the player to be strong and fulfill the mission, [since he’s even shown to easily be defeated once you let go of your control and fight him with the Judge.](https://imgur.com/a/q7RoFYA)
So there is really only one way to put a stop to the Batter’s actions… stop playing the game.
I talked about this in a cryptic way earlier too, because it’ll come up again for our next game.
But for now… yeah, that’s basically the one choice you have outside the ending split, just turn the game off or don’t.
And while it’s never directly presented as an intentional choice for you, [the 4th wall breaks certainly allude to something like this being an option at least,](https://imgur.com/a/MTe9TNt) and there IS the game over theme that [does actually encourage you to “Stay in your coma”,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVph5zlM5JA) a very direct message to quit if I’ve ever seen one.
And here’s the thing… from what I propose with Deltarune, it would basically be the same. You could also have a choice, exactly like this.

My suggestion was that the ending in which the Angel, aka. Noelle, wins and causes the world to fall into an eternal night… well, [it only happens if you give up during Deltarune’s game over screen,](https://imgur.com/a/iY4BNB6) and the ending in which the world is reborn instead ALWAYS happens if you play all the way to the end.
And unlike OFF, Deltarune also makes it much more obvious that this is an actual choice you can make by giving you two very clear options, rather than just pressing the big red X button.
Toby has always been a man to utilize meta storytelling, so we shouldn’t just accept the game over screen as your average “do you want to keep playing” menu, for a good reason.
No, [the way that it’s first presented in chapter 1 and the way giving up always plays out with the darkness that eventually leads to the game closing…](https://youtu.be/3GvCxDEkxXc?si=JUFL6erPnJMtWGke&t=41) naaah.
This is an actual choice, [do you want to continue with this struggle or not, will you persist?](https://imgur.com/a/7bTPGve)
Could quite possibly be the only choice prompt that will have an actual impact on the ending.
As in… giving up gives you the only other ending that exists, the bad one.
Which is what makes it so genius in a meta way, as the player literally giving up on the world corresponds to and enables the Angel giving up on the world as well, and we don’t even realize it, because we wouldn’t think twice about a game mechanic like a game over screen.
And that’s exactly why good old Gaster tells us that [the future is in our hands if we choose to continue instead,](https://imgur.com/a/Od6Bp6h) as this is what will cause the heroes to win against the Angel and give the world a second chance.
So I also think that something as seemingly simple as Deltarune’s game over has huge implications, and that it may have also been partially inspired by the way OFF plays out.
At least that’s what it seems like to me with all the other rebirth and death of the world stuff that the game has already got going on.
It’s truly insane that even this game, when I didn’t expect it going into it the first time, will further advance my rebirth theory agenda.
My schizoposting keeps being enabled, can’t be good for my mental health.

So yeah, all of this… I think I’m making a pretty good case here on how OFF could have inspired Deltarune too, huh?
All the Undertale inspirations set a good precedent for Toby being a sneaky little boy, and all the rest surprisingly works well with all my Deltarune theories.
HOWEVER, it’s still not over!
Because there’s one aspect to the Batter’s quest, and the fate of the world in general, that I have not yet properly gotten into.
And that aspect… is the religious one.
Which, if you’ve read all my theories so far, is easy to guess how it would tie into Deltarune.
And man, you haven’t seen the end of that stuff until… well, until you’ve seen the actual end of this project here, because religion will get its own section dedicated to it.
Regardless, I’ve made a good case in the past why religion is going to play a major role in Deltarune’s story on multiple occasions now, [with the main one being this.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/rgb8cg/kris_inner_demons_theory_part_1_secret_bosses_and/)
And OFF is certainly no different in that aspect, despite lesser direct focus on it.

I think it’s important to immediately clear up that, despite it being very obvious anyway, [a religious reading is by no means unintended](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=5165) *(1:26:05 - 1:26:28)* and very much [intentional on the dev’s part.](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=7736) *(2:08:56 - 2:09:09)*
So first, [the concept of “purifying”](https://i.imgur.com/342vMa2.png) has religious connotations right out of the gate.
[Purifying people or locations is a concept present in many religions, including Christianity,](https://imgur.com/a/3PkKH2s) even though rituals related to that might not always be outright referred to as purification too.
Furthermore, the Batter [self-describing his quest as “sacred”](https://i.imgur.com/bqeGZpf.png) is as obvious as one could make it.
His class name is [also called “Savior”,](https://i.imgur.com/fGBgE1N.png) which ties into [the “Lord and Savior” phrase that mostly refers to Jesus,](https://imgur.com/a/6rLr9tS) but Jesus earned that title due to his role to the concept of “salvation” in Christianity, which was likely more the general idea behind the Batter’s title, rather than directly Jesus.
Essentially, [the Batter is bringing salvation by removing sin and purifying the world,](https://imgur.com/a/XoSL1KI) because to him [the entire world is beyond redemption.](https://imgur.com/a/LFBUMk1)
I also never mentioned them before, but [the Batter actually has party members,](https://i.imgur.com/WrRJjEl.png) even though they don’t say a word.
These “Add-Ons”, [who Mortis is aware of look like halos,](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=7708) *(2:08:28 - 2:08:55)* have interesting names worth pointing out.
[Or less their own names,](https://i.imgur.com/3iulbMz.png) the real interesting part are the titles of their class, just like with the Batter.
These names are [“Father, Son and Holy Spirit”.](https://imgur.com/a/4d2qra5)
This is obviously a clear as day reference to the Christian “Trinity”, [a doctrine that defines God to be made up of the three aforementioned people.](https://i.imgur.com/VXG7t9H.png)
So the presence of 3 halo-like rings accompanying Batter that make up God… well, it either means that the Batter’s mission is literally blessed and aided by God, walking with him in a way, or maybe even means that the Batter is actually God himself.
The Batter was also created by Hugo and [is likely a representation of his dad,](https://imgur.com/a/f06cLO2) viewing him as the supervillain from his only form of entertainment, which makes him indirectly a father figure as well, similar to God… who by coincidence is also not viewed favorably by everyone for a lot of his cruel actions.

However, despite the Add-Ons and being a potential father replacement, due to [the game’s insistence of viewing the Batter as a puppet and the player as the puppeteer,](https://imgur.com/a/0MYWVZL) combined with the dev stating that the Batter 
[only came into existence once the player started the game…](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=18077) *(5:01:17 - 5:01:26)* well, him being God himself seems rather unlikely now, doesn’t it?
Maybe instead it means that the player is actually God instead, which makes sense with the power you hold over the entire world, being literally just files on your computer.
So that means that the Batter is either God’s vessel, or he could [specifically be an angel.](https://i.imgur.com/qouniWs.png)
Despite his humanoid appearance, the Batter is [distinctively not human, as mentioned by the creator.](https://imgur.com/a/ftqYx99)
Furthermore, some interpretations of angels had them basically be [subservient puppets to God made to follow specific purposes, which works excellently with the Batter’s stoicism and completely narrow-minded goals.](https://imgur.com/a/aid6VRC)
But even in more known views of angels, [they can serve as messengers and righteous warriors of God, something the Batter both displays as well.](https://imgur.com/a/Xv9qhFu)
By all means, angels basically exist, and can even seemingly just be created, for the sole purpose of carrying out God’s will.
Also, despite the Batter’s clear lack of wings in both forms, I do think it’s worth mentioning that his “true” appearance might have been [described as that of a “ducky” by Sugar,](https://i.imgur.com/LDiDbLV.png) who do have wings.

Which reminds me, the fact that the Batter is perceived differently depending on the view point could actually also relate to angels in a shockingly similar way.
They’re mostly seen as spiritual beings, although this is inconsistent, [which is interesting to note,](https://imgur.com/a/07CtuEY) but if they’re spiritual, they would lack physical bodies.
And their perceived appearance, as noted by some people, is… well, are you familiar with the [biblically accurate angel meme based on an actual biblical description of an angel?](https://i.imgur.com/Uwdvx5o.jpg)
It’s assumed that the humanoid form they often take is simply one form chosen to avoid breaking a human’s mind, [as they’re very much treated like a Lovecraftian horror,](https://imgur.com/a/G02Myjh) and even their [overwhelming presence in human form is enough to strike fear into someone’s heart.](https://i.imgur.com/EYopq2U.png)
And as you could tell from the pronouns and the angel being described as a “man”, the form they usually take does appear rather masculine, which obviously lines up with the Batter looking like [a very bland man.](https://i.imgur.com/bqeGZpf.png)
Maybe in a way you could argue that our common perception of angels is just what WE want to see, what makes us feel the most comfortable.
So now… remember just [how truly demonic the Batter will look](https://i.imgur.com/xexE2Jl.png) once we abandon him and agree with the Judge?
The true reason for him appearing as a regular man is probably because that’s what we wanted him to be.
And you can take this further to specifically mean that we wanted him to be a regular human because we’re the ones controlling him, we have a desire [to project ourselves onto him,](https://i.imgur.com/rMY3XfS.png) but once we realize our error and no longer want to do that… a different non-human form is shown, the thing we’re seeing him as now… the monster that he truly is.

Now, seeing as everything I said implies the Batter is carrying out the player’s will, a parallel to an angel and their God, it suddenly starts to make a bit more sense [why the game still feels comfortable blaming you for the events of the game,](https://imgur.com/a/7lReSgv) despite your initial ignorance of the consequences of your actions.
When you go into a JRPG, [you do so to defeat the enemies, bosses, etc.](https://imgur.com/a/WqvEeZc) and certainly not stuff like talking [or sparing anybody.](https://i.imgur.com/nvG6FDt.png) 
Maybe it’s that exact desire that gave birth to [the “demented purificatory incarnation” that is the Batter,](https://imgur.com/a/Cvj54QZ) and again, [all without you even realizing it.](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=18077) *(5:01:17 - 5:01:26)*
So the Batter’s insistence on purifying everything, as well as constant attitude to keep things moving into that direction, might have been intended to be a reflection of a player’s desire to just get to the action, kill every villain and not think about it like in a normal JRPG, [as Zacharie pretty much spells it out in his meta introduction.](https://imgur.com/a/XfS9OIA)
And I mean… didn’t the Judge [call the player the Batter’s soul right at the start?](https://i.imgur.com/iJYrTsN.png)
What if we were actually supposed to take that in every sense of the word?
It’s not the same as it’s with Kris, where the player is acting more like a parasite to their soul.
You truly make up the Batter’s inner being. 
He’s a reflection of your soul, he’s you and you are him.
That’s the (admittedly not too obvious) way that the player being blamed isn’t some cheap trick that makes you feel as betrayed as the Judge himself, but does actually have a lot of meaning behind it that could be lost on you when first looking at the ending.
You might not be conscious of it, but you are responsible for what’s happening, and just by continuously playing, you are also going along with it the entire time and helping the Batter achieve it to begin with, not to mention I also said earlier that he’s actually quite weak without your influence too.
It’s for certain that none of this could have happened without you.

As a callback to earlier, I’m sure that’s once again what Toby saw in this too, and he decided that Undertale would also give you the same responsibility, but actually give you a choice.
Still that’s Undertale, but I have to tie it back to Deltarune as well, don’t I?
Thankfully… that just happens to be fairly easy.
Not even the theme this is touching on anymore, but very directly.
Aren’t we pretty much the God of Deltarune’s world as well?
We most definitely would view us that arrogantly, wouldn’t we?
In a game [that’s also meta and we’re acknowledged as an entity, a thing beyond their world, with our power also having to be akin to a God, being able to destroy and create entire worlds in an instant.](https://imgur.com/a/qhuF61g)
Of course, just like OFF, [we can’t exactly determine the course of action in the game,](https://imgur.com/a/U5G1PYj) so we’re by no means omnipotent in both cases, but certainly a deity and the closest thing to a God they have, with the power of a kill switch.
Here’s the thing, us being God works dangerously well with what we learned about angels.
Kris is an unwilling vessel that doesn’t want to listen to us, sure, [but Noelle is different and obeys our every wish…](https://imgur.com/a/Qb4AvEF) and I mean [EVERY wish.](https://imgur.com/a/mSdcqB1)
You better have [read my theory on Noelle by now, like the rest, just like I recommend.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/rsygbe/deep_look_into_the_weirdsnowgrave_route_and/)
With me concluding that Noelle is [the Angel from the prophecy,](https://i.imgur.com/ENyBeWA.png) including the idea that the weird route will follow us turning her into our new vessel to force our will upon the world… well, then that’s just it, right?
If she is the Angel, then [that makes her a servant of God…](https://i.imgur.com/qouniWs.png) and who else would she [serve than the player themself,](https://imgur.com/a/KRNrXTO) who is God in this equation?
Her existence as our vessel also would make her an intermediary between us and the world of Deltarune, [just like how Angels are the same for God and Earth.](https://i.imgur.com/cM7ayGj.png)
So yeah, based on my theories… this whole Christian angle in OFF is already showing itself as something Toby could have possibly taken from, both games opting to treat the player as a godlike-figure in their meta narrative and their controllable character as “God’s servant” that carries out their will.
The Batter and my proposed role for Noelle just keep being too similar… angelic vessels for their God who will end up thinking that the only way to put an end to the world’s suffering is by simply making it vanish… could we not?
Wait, he’s even always acting icy, while Noelle is literally icy, goddammit.
What’s with all that nihilism and ending the game by destroying the world and shit?
These Angels are ⠀⠀⠀⠀ Pissing me OFF.

Speaking of OFF, I’m still not quite done with the religious parallels there.
Another one is [the Batter’s permanently closed eyes.](https://i.imgur.com/FNfvMJ2.png)
With his intense zealotry, one could attribute this quite literal design choice to the phrase [“blinded by faith”.](https://imgur.com/a/aJlxMOg)
Which of course is also additionally relevant to us, the player, in a way.
After all, what I just described about the player’s expectations and beliefs regarding standard JRPG conventions, is also something you could deem to be “blind faith”.
You go into OFF having blind faith in the game’s narrative and that it would be just like any other JRPG, a literal black and white outlook on the world and so on.
And I think that view was what spawned the equally black and white Batter as a direct result.
The intentional design choice of Batter’s eyes is further reinforced by official artwork.
Apparently, sadly I couldn’t find the direct source for this, the Batter’s sprite in the game was going to be changed to having his eyes obscured by shadows.
And despite the lack of source and quote, those plans seem fairly obviously thanks to [one image from the game](https://i.imgur.com/uVzqLGB.png) but with absolutely [any official art that came out after the game’s release and even some before, all of which depict him with his eyes completely hidden.](https://imgur.com/a/47kvx12)
So the insistence on his eyes not just being closed, but visually absent, definitely lends itself to my “blind faith” proposal, whether it also extends to the meta level with the player or not.
Of course, the fact that his new official design has his eyes shadowed out is also relevant to [our favorite knife-wielding teenager and fellow puppet.](https://i.imgur.com/c1xRUIt.png)
Especially because [Kris isn’t the only one with eyes cloaked in shadows, and it must clearly hold significant symbolic meaning in Deltarune too,](https://imgur.com/a/Dt6coFh) it wasn’t just done to look cool and edgy.
Hell, maybe even [the Batter’s old design with closed eyes had a hand in inspiring Frisk’s design too,](https://i.imgur.com/jQmnOtM.png) but there’s also other candidates for this that we’ll get into later.
Still, being able to turn Frisk into an emotionless killer with a blank expression isn’t a similarity lost on me either, there’s more here than just Kris.

Now, onto the next religious thing.
You may have noticed already that the entire religious angle of OFF depicts Religion as a force for some pretty bad things, which I think is by no means unintentional.
The creator has said that [he doesn’t believe in religion,](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=5175) *(1:26:15 - 1:26:23)* and at a later point in time even said he’s an atheist directly, although I couldn’t find that timestamp anymore.
And I think nothing really shows more that there’s negative feelings associated here than with what we’re about to look at.
You see, the idea of the Batter, either being God or, as I said to be way more likely, an angel of God, deciding to purify the world because it’s simply too rotten and corrupt… well… if you’re familiar with Christian stories, [this isn’t very out of left field for that territory.](https://imgur.com/a/lbjxkTF)
There have been quite a few cases of “The Wrath of God”, where humanity’s actions have led to him enacting divine retribution… [and with “a few”, I mean a lot.](https://imgur.com/a/skGBSnq)
You’re probably most familiar with [stuff like Sodom and Gomorrah,](https://i.imgur.com/45kd4nj.png) places that God considered so irredeemable that he went ahead and just completely wiped them out.
Or more like [sent out his angels to do that job,](https://imgur.com/a/TQTfElO) a very important detail for us in relation to the Batter.
But the most famous example of such a story is the great flood, [where God considered the entire world to be too corrupt and wanted to wipe the slate clean.](https://imgur.com/a/bZpOBrO)

All of this sounds a lot like what happens in OFF, where the Batter views the world as [too corrupt and miserable, making him desire to turn it into an empty slate,](https://imgur.com/a/zb46ttR) and in the end [turns OFF (ha) the switch](https://imgur.com/a/74jq8ae) to presumably revert the world [back into the state of pristine nothingness from which it, and the Batter himself, came from…](https://imgur.com/a/joOpLQh) free of sin, but also everything else.
So that’s the truth behind [the whole sacred mission he’s carrying out,](https://i.imgur.com/bqeGZpf.png) it’s a direct parallel to Christian stories of God’s wrath in response to irredeemable sin.
Except that the Batter even went a step further, with the intent of leaving nothing alive, nothing left to ever recreate anything ever again… like a God who has given up hope.
Now, you might be wondering how all of that connects to Deltarune.
And well… WOW, okay, buddy, whew, oh man.
I don’t think it’s the time and place for this yet, because I have an entire section dedicated to the religious inspirations that Deltarune has likely taken, and it’s comfortably sitting at the end of this entire project.
So consider this a titillating teaser for what’s to come.
Rest assured, this will pay off, I can’t afford to just tip my toes into and half-ass it now.
This shit needs my FULL dedication… and yours as well.
Also, yes, I know I made it sound like this project is mostly going to look at game inspirations Toby took, but we’ll have to include the Bible in that too.
Truly the most video game of all time.
Anyway, let’s just move on.

Pretty much got all the big stuff out of the way, just some minor things I need to touch on left.
First is Japhet’s appearance.
You mostly get to see him [as a big bird emerging out of a cat,](https://i.imgur.com/TyEKBPk.png) very pleasant sight.
But during a section in the final part of the game, where you get to experience some of Hugo’s memories, you get to meet Japhet and see how he looked back then.
And there’s not much to say outside of [him looking suspiciously like Everyman,](https://imgur.com/a/7OtrYW6) one of the most mysterious lore aspects of Undertale/Deltarune, just with another black line added to signify the beak.
Coincidence due to similar artistic inclinations… maybe.
Yet, seeing as Everyman’s introduction was through the Reaper BIRD specifically, you really gotta wonder if this is truly a coincidence too, after everything else we’ve been through.
Now onto the next stuff, which has some more religious ties again.
The whole sacred quest that the Batter is on… kinda seems something we could be looking at in Deltarune too.
The fountains in the game are [referred to as “holy” both by characters in game and through outside information.](https://imgur.com/a/hXLBHVz)
With the King [acting like a zealot for the Knight’s actions,](https://imgur.com/a/O8Dnhcj) it leads one to wonder if the Knight shares some of the same passion that the King has.
It could be that the Knight also views themselves as being on a holy mission by opening these fountains everywhere, giving us a good chance that they’re similar to the Batter in that specific aspect.
I’m not entirely convinced of that, due to who I think the Knight is nowadays, but I [definitely think they’re convinced they’re doing a good thing,](https://imgur.com/a/OWIx1GX) regardless of whether or not it arises from religious fervor. 
However, if you believe the theory of Alvin being the Knight, then this must be a laughably easy sell for you, even though I personally don’t fully subscribe to that anymore… which might have honestly started to become a detriment, but I’m too stubborn to go back on my choice now, I like my current candidate more.

Now onto something else, there’s another thing worth noting about the fountains.
The way you seal them and then the entire dark world disappears… [that process just reminds me a lot of when you purify a zone in OFF after defeating its guardian, causing it to lose all life.](https://imgur.com/a/CFfkEaj)
This makes the guardians, [the “living engines” who form these worlds,](https://imgur.com/a/jyBl6r2) essentially some kind of living dark fountain in a way… so that’s an interesting way to look at them.
Especially because [determination creates the fountains,](https://imgur.com/a/UKXorD1) and the [hopes and dreams of lightners presumably form the worlds.](https://imgur.com/a/2y8lTJU)
We can assume that [pretty much the same was happening here for the zones in OFF,](https://imgur.com/a/2P6sqa7) before the guardians’ hopes and dreams became corrupted at least.
So the guardians basically just get rid of the middle step and just become that power source themselves.
You can even see that the zones are powered directly by their own spirit, [as the reason that zone 3 starts losing color before you even defeat Enoch, is because he was so exhausted from chasing you,](https://imgur.com/a/IR7BQTi) with that loss of strength translating to the zone also losing power to maintain itself, [which has been directly confirmed by Mortis Ghost.](https://youtu.be/6CCSMjOd0RE?t=13756) *(3:49:16 - 3:49:34)*
Of course, all of this is not exactly the same, but the idea of these worlds losing shape after cutting their power source is similar.
Also worth noting that [Kris is specifically the one sealing all the fountains,](https://imgur.com/a/bT0N4Zi) the act I described to be presented in a similar way to purifying a zone.
This firmly gives Kris another similarity to the Batter that isn’t just their design.
See, Noelle isn’t the only one who gets to have parallels with the Batter, don’t think I forgot something so obvious!
There’s also another thing from a different game, one that Toby Fox fans should be more familiar with, which I think was a bigger inspiration for dark worlds, and you’ll see that soon.
But I just don’t think this means that OFF didn’t influence the mechanics of dark fountains at all, even if it was just slightly.
After all, I’ve already made a pretty good case for a bunch of other things from this game, so why not also this?

So, I think it’s time we finally wrap things up, because I’m out of material.
I’m very happy with how this turned out already.
I think OFF served as an excellent introduction to what I’m trying to do here with this.
The first half showing you the obvious ways Toby was inspired by the game for Undertale, and the second half showing what could have influenced Deltarune, the exact thing I’m planning to do for the rest of this project.
Not just the material in Deltarune we already have, but predicting what we could see in the game’s future thanks to it.
But as you could tell, even though I’m required to delve into these other pieces of media for comparisons, I might end up getting a bit too much into their lore and go on about things that aren’t exactly required for Deltarune… and I can’t help it.
If you liked this already, then I’m sure you’re going to love the fact that we’ll do this 5 more times, with most of them being longer than this section.
Get your coffee ready, folks!
And if you didn’t like it, then… well, have fun torturing yourself, because it’s only going to get more unhinged from here.
But I hope if you’ve stuck around for this long, you can manage to stick around until the very end.
Make sure to take breaks though and to share your thoughts on things under their respective sections.
Like I said, that’s preferable over dumping all discussion on the first or final post.
Unless you just want to call me gay and cringe, then feel free to leave those in either the first or last part, that is completely fine by me.
Alright, now that we’re done with OFF, let us move to another game, or more like franchise, that we also have a clear (and obvious) confirmation for having inspired Toby’s works.
Don’t get used to it, we don’t always have that luxury.
So what is it, you ask?
… well… you should be the least surprised to see this one here…

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

All the ingredients in Pineal Guardian are designed to achieve two main effects:

Support memory function

Unlike some pineal supplements that promise to ""supercharge"" your pineal gland or attract immense wealth, the makers of Pineal Guardian focus on supporting memory function and brain health.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it’s essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body’s circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it’s time to sleep and stops production when it’s time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you’ve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you’ve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it’s essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body’s circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it’s time to sleep and stops production when it’s time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

How Does Pineal Guardian Work?  
Pineal Guardian uses a blend of nine natural ingredients to target your pineal gland.

The makers of Pineal Guardian claim these ingredients are perfectly combined to support memory function and overall brain health. They also emphasize that the ingredients are constantly tested for purity and potency.

All the ingredients in Pineal Guardian are designed to achieve two main effects:

Support memory function  
Enhance overall brain health  
Unlike some pineal supplements that promise to ""supercharge"" your pineal gland or attract immense wealth, the makers of Pineal Guardian focus on supporting memory function and brain health.

Understanding the Pineal Gland  
To understand how Pineal Guardian works, it’s essential to understand the pineal gland and its functions.

The pineal gland is a small brain gland responsible for various cognitive functions. Similar to the pituitary gland, it produces hormones linked to various bodily functions.

One of the pineal gland's critical roles is producing hormones related to the body’s circadian rhythm, or natural sleep-wake cycle. This rhythm influences when you fall asleep and wake up.

A crucial hormone involved in the circadian rhythm is melatonin. The pineal gland creates and releases melatonin when it’s time to sleep and stops production when it’s time to wake up. Balanced melatonin levels contribute to healthy sleep patterns.

The Impact of Toxins on Your Pineal Gland  
Why might you need a pineal gland supplement? What happens to your pineal gland over time?

As you age, your pineal gland accumulates toxins daily from the air, water, and food, including fluoride. Some experts believe these toxins can cause the pineal gland to calcify, hindering its proper function.

A calcified pineal gland can disrupt your connection to the spiritual world. According to some practitioners, the pineal gland is the ""third eye,"" and its calcification can lead to bad luck and cognitive issues.

The ""Third Eye"" and Pineal Gland  
The concept of the ""third eye"" suggests that the pineal gland allows you to perceive the world beyond ordinary vision.

For centuries, traditional medicine practitioners have viewed the pineal gland as a third eye, providing a spiritual connection.

Practitioners believe bad luck might be linked to your third eye. If you’ve recently experienced misfortune, it could be due to calcification of your pineal gland.

While alternative medicine practitioners frequently target the pineal gland, there's no formal Western scientific evidence confirming its unique spiritual connection. However, a 1987 study found the pineal gland is sensitive to light, possibly explaining its ""third eye"" designation.

Some practitioners believe Pineal Guardian can promote pineal gland health, reverse bad luck, and enhance cognition.

1g4ckb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/1g4ckb6/the_office_plant_bandit/,The office plant bandit,"In my office, we had a communal plant, a lovely little pothos that everyone adored. It brightened up the break room and was a great conversation starter. However, our office had one major problem: Lisa, the self-proclaimed “plant expert.” She believed she knew everything about plant care and took it upon herself to “supervise” the watering and general maintenance of the pothos.

The problem was, Lisa was a bit of a micromanager. If you dared to water the plant without her approval, she would huff and puff about how it wasn’t your day to tend to it. Once, I came in to find her dramatically fussing over the pothos, acting like it was her child, while everyone else was just trying to enjoy their coffee.

One day, I decided enough was enough. I knew I couldn’t confront her directly without causing an office drama, so I hatched a plan.

I waited for a day when Lisa was out sick, and I quietly took the pothos home with me after work. I gave it a good wash and re-potted it in a beautiful ceramic pot I had bought online. I even added some decorative stones to the top for extra flair. The next day, I brought it back to the office, but I left it in my own cubicle instead of the break room.

The best part? I set up an elaborate “adoption” sign next to the plant, complete with a funny backstory about how it was rescued from the clutches of an overzealous caretaker and was looking for a new home where it could thrive without constant scrutiny. I included a photo of the pothos in its new pot, proudly displaying its vibrant leaves.

As people passed by, they were amused by the story and started visiting my cubicle to “check in” on the plant. They even began to give it a name: “Petey the Pothos.” Meanwhile, Lisa noticed that the plant was gone and started asking around, clearly distraught about the loss of her precious “supervised” plant.

One of my colleagues, in an attempt to tease her, mentioned that Petey was doing great in my care. Lisa turned pale and started to make her way over to my desk, where a small crowd was now gathered, admiring Petey.

I feigned innocence, asking, “Oh, didn’t you hear? I adopted him! He’s so much happier now that he’s free from all the… management.” The laughter that erupted from my colleagues was priceless, and Lisa’s face was a mixture of shock and indignation.

In the following weeks, Lisa tried to “rescue” Petey multiple times, but the plant became a beloved office icon. Everyone loved the way it brightened the space, and I made sure to take care of it properly—without any of her overbearing advice.

Now, every time Lisa would drop a passive-aggressive comment about plants, I’d smile, knowing I had outsmarted the office plant bandit and given Petey a life free from unnecessary supervision. And as for Petey? He thrived under my care, becoming even more beautiful than he had ever been.",99,1729011511.0,pettyrevenge,12,0.85,False

1g4ccdn,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1g4ccdn/intermittently_and_increasingly_reactive_dog/,Intermittently and increasingly reactive dog,"Hi, 

Was wondering if anyone could offer advice. Sorry for length, but I think it's all relevant. 

We have two dogs, different breed, same age. One is a rough collie, the other a lab/collie cross. Both intact; we hadn't intended to keep them intact, but the lab has had a few seizures (infrequent enough to currently not be medicated, but nervous about GA), and the other has had to be taken out of a GA before due to heart rate. Until now their dynamic has been good. It's still mostly good; 95% of the time they happily co-exist. The collie is ""my"" dog, and the lab my husbands; I'd say the lab is more equally bonded to both of us, whereas the collie is definitely far more attached to me. 

The rough collie has gotten increasingly reactive over the last year, and far moreso the last few months. 2/3 years ago he was attacked by a huge bulldog in the park. All dogs were on a lead, but this dog pulled the lead out of the owners hand, and made a beeline for us. I had to pull the dog off (owner was terrified of her own dog; was subsequently re-homed) and luckily it was just a lot of noise, and he was unharmed, but I truly thought he was done for. He's been very nervous around large white dogs since then, and over time has become more reactive to any other reactive dog (always leashed). And it seems like there's been a big increase of these dogs in our local area. 

This isn't the biggest issue though; I feel like I could handle this if it was just my dog and these other dogs. There's two main things: the first is that when we encounter another reactive dog on a walk, he redirects aggression to our lab. It's not injurious, but really upsetting, and I feel so bad for our lab. It happens with cats too; there's one road round the corner where they often see cats, and the collie now seems to be primed to get excited, even if there's no cat, and also redirects this onto our lab. 

Then there's patterned reactivity in the home which is truly the worst. This really increased a couple of months ago, after I'd been away for a couple of days twice during one month. It's come and gone since then, but just happened again today, after a good while of harmony. I mostly work from home, and although it increased after I'd been away, it's far worse on days I'm in the house all day, and almost always after dinner. On days I'm at the office, even when I come home and feed them dinner, it doesn't seem to happen. 

Most of the day it's fine; lab is even ""permitted"" to cuddle with me in bed before I get up, and/or on the sofa before I start work. Lab has always preferred the front living room; we used to use this room less than we do now, and he's always hung out in there a lot. Collie has usually spent more time in the study with me, even when it was more of a communal second living room. Lab also has a bed in the hall where collie simply won't touch him. He'll sometimes go here if he senses collie is grumbly. 

So they'll be hanging out wherever; the day has been fine. I'll feed them dinner, and then regardless of where I am, lab is absolutely not allowed anywhere near me. It used to be that the collie would grumble a little, but nothing would happen. Then occasionally (not often or predictably) if they were passing or near each other in a constricted place (e.g. near the coffee table and sofa), collie would get angry, growl, and then go for the lab, lab would rise up and bark back, and it would fizzzle out. 

But now, if lab is anywhere near me after dinner, even lying down totally on the other end of the sofa, collie will actively seek him out and go for him. My instinct was initially to shout to break it up, but realised quickly this would create more fear, so the first time (of two) collie went for lab while lab was curled up and peaceful, I watched to see what happened. Lab got pinned, and then collie slowly backed off, but lab stayed frozen where he was for a while. This happened once more. If I left the room, they were fine together, but then if I returned and sat down, I could tell the same was about to happen, so I'd get up and leave again. Once I noticed this, the next night I fed them, and went to my study and closed the door, and they were totally the fine. 

Doesn't happen with my husband. In some way, I seem to be the problem for the house incidents, but I don't know how to fix it. I've thought about behaviourist; I had a call with one but it didn't seem quite right, and I'm at a loss as to how to figure out how to choose a behaviourist. I'm in the UK, and suspect there's no regulation around the use of this term.

My passport appointment was scheduled for 1:00 PM at the Navrangpura passport office, and I arrived on time, received my token, and settled in to wait. Everything was moving along as expected, until something — or rather someone — added a bit of unexpected charm to the process.

As I sat there waiting for my token number to be called, I noticed a girl standing nearby. Her token was part of a different series, but somehow, our paths kept crossing throughout the process. Each time we moved to the next waiting area, we found ourselves standing or sitting near each other, purely by coincidence.

Finally, we reached the last counter, and by that time, I was completely drained. I had no energy left, but when she arrived and looked around for a seat, I instantly offered her mine idk how. She smiled politely and declined, so I didn't insist. A few moments later, an uncle sitting beside me got called for his turn, leaving the seat next to me vacant. She sat down.

That's when a casual conversation began. We started chatting—nothing too deep, just small talk, mostly about the frustrating announcement system which announces tokens randomly without any sequence. We would glance at the screen, repeatedly guessing when our numbers might appear, laughing and groaning at the absurdity of the system. It was strange but pleasant, sharing that moment of impatience with someone who seemed to make time pass a little easier.

After what felt like ages, my number was finally called. We exchanged a quick glance as I got up, and I headed to the counter. The officer went through my documents—yet again—and then sent me to another official in a cabin for verification. It was the usual rigmarole, and by the time I finished and returned, she was gone.

I lingered for a moment, hoping to see her one last time, to say a proper goodbye. But she had already left. Maybe she thought I was taking too long, or maybe she had other places to be. I couldn’t help but feel a little disappointed—just when I thought we might exchange a few more words, or even just a smile before parting ways, she vanished like a fleeting moment.

As I walked out of the office, I couldn’t shake the thought of her calm, attractive presence. It felt like we shared something small yet meaningful in those brief moments. I don’t know if I’ll ever see her again, but those few hours of waiting together left an impression on me. Sometimes, the most unexpected encounters can leave you with the most lasting memories.

TLDR; I met a girl at the Navrangpura passport office, and we shared a nice chat while waiting for our turn. She left before I could say goodbye. Hoping, by some chance, this post helps me reconnect with her.

The film ranked first at the weekend box office, beating Double Jeopardy and The Story of Us, a fellow weekend opener

The film was perceived as the forerunner of a new mood in American political life. Like other 1999 films Magnolia, Being John Malkovich, and Three Kings, Fight Club was recognized as an innovator in cinematic form and style, since it exploited new developments in filmmaking technology

● After Fight Club's theatrical release, it became more popular via word of mouth, and the positive reception of the DVD/VHS established it as a cult film that David Ansen of Newsweek conjectured would enjoy ""perennial"" fame.

● Between 2000 and 2009, several fight clubs were formed across the US that were allegedly inspired by the film. Teens and preteens in Texas, New Jersey, Washington state, and Alaska also initiated fight clubs and posted videos of their fights online, leading authorities to break up the clubs and/or make arrests 

● On July 16, 2009, a 17-year-old who had formed his own fight club in Manhattan was charged with detonating a homemade bomb outside a Starbucks Coffee shop in the Upper East Side.

When he wasn't looking, I slipped in a good amount of money, handed it back, and said, ""Thanks, man. Here's a little something for you."" Then I made my exit, never looked back.   
Now, here's the deal: I tend to forget these good deeds after a few days. So, I had a lightbulb moment – why not create a Chrome extension? Since I'm on my computer all day anyway, this extension can remind me of the nice things I've done. It sends reminders on the same day every year.   
  
How cool is that?I thought I'd share this with the world. You're gonna love it!

I’ve always enjoyed the walk from my mom’s place to my office.  The city always feels so alive in the morning.  Noise, people, activity everywhere.  There’s a really cute coffee shop on the corner along the way that I always stop at.  The barista is always so friendly and quick.  It’s such a contrast to the calming hum of the mountains that I can’t help but get excited.  I needed that this morning because I was running on only three hours of sleep.

I found myself thinking about Ian and our relationship.  We met at a dance club not to far from where I was walking.  I’d been out of a previous relationship for about 6 months when a group of coworkers decided to go out on the town on a Friday night.  I and a couple other ladies were dancing away when I noticed this guy that looked like Hayden Christensen just staring at me.  I kept glancing over and it was clear that he wasn’t taking his eyes off of me.  NGL, it turned me on.  He stopped me as I was leaving the dance floor, but it was far too loud to hear each other.  We tried to chat in a back corner, but it didn’t take long before we decided to leave and find a quiet diner where we could eat and chat.

He had some hilarious stories from his escapades that gave me belly laughs.  We really started connecting when he started describing his difficulties in running the shop though.  Back then I was so full of new professional energy that I couldn’t keep myself from talking about how to properly account for and manage his business.  He listened attentively to every word; I think he even pretended to take notes.  It made me feel special.

I’m not into ONS’s.  Seizure meds and alcohol don’t ever mix so I don’t drink and, therefore, have never had that boost of inhibition.  I’ve always been cautious about relationships, but I was pretty hooked by this guy from the start.  He walked me to my mom’s building; we shared our contact information and had an impressive make out session before I went up to bed and he went on his way.

He called me the next morning and asked if I’d join him for breakfast.  We continued our conversations like there was no pause at all.  He talked me into driving out to his shop and then we went on a mountain hike to a lake where we had a little picnic in a place that you would have thought no-one had been before.  I drove home that evening feeling the warmth of love. 

We were an official couple two weeks later.  I started spending weekends at his place after a month.  I moved in with him when we got engaged after about a year.  We got married in a small ceremony on Labor Day last year.  During the whole time we’ve been together I’ve been an integral part of the business.

The shop, as a business, was a disaster when I first started dating Ian.  I haven’t mentioned it before, but Ian’s mom passed away from cancer right around the time when Leah moved out.  Ian’s dad kind of fell apart from that point on and the shop suffered.  Ian was 25 when he and his brother inherited it.  They had pretty much taken over all the work part in the previous couple of years, so that wasn’t a problem, it was the business part that they had no clue how to handle.  I don’t think the shop would have lasted another 6 months if I hadn’t shown up to help.

It's always been a cash business.  A customer drops off their toy and they don’t get to pick it back up unless they pay cash for the parts and services.  The problem was that their dad had stopped worrying about getting work orders properly filled out.  He was just billing customers by memory by the time just before he passed.  It created a mess for the brothers to deal with.  Our first major change was ensuring that every job was properly tracked.  The boys started writing down the parts that were used and the time it took to fix a unit.  We also tacked on a little surcharge for the oil, nuts and polish that would always accompany any job.  That became their first step of returning the shop to being a business.

We also worked on getting them some proper banking arrangements.  An operating line of credit that was supported by their land and building gave us some real time to make meaningful changes to the business operations.  The bank did require an audit though.  We found a local firm willing to do the audit at a very reasonable rate because of my credentials as the controller of the business (I was so proud when we made that deal).

As many of you have probably thought, the boys starting to charge the “real” amount for their work rather than their dad’s guesstimate, did start to concern customers.  They had a pretty long period of some pretty sweet deals and were starting to blame the boys for taking advantage of them.  It wasn’t the case, but customer perception is their reality.

The Coup de Grace as they say, was when we changed our parts supplier.  The family had been using a wholesaler in the city for all their parts.  They would look at a machine, figure out the parts needed, then see if the wholesaler had them.  The price for the parts wasn’t horrible but the shipping was killing them.  They’d either have the parts sent by Purolator or UPS and pay the fee or one of the brothers would drive to and from the city.  Ian was on one of those runs when we met.  He was late getting to the warehouse and needed to stay overnight to pick up the parts.

The shop’s markup was 10% on parts, basically they would charge $110 for a part that cost them $100.  This is somewhat standard to their industry because they make their money on service.  The problem was that their costs to get the parts to the shop was not only destroying that 10% markup but also cutting into their service profit.  Add the fact that dad was forgetting parts in their billing and the business was doomed to fail.

I’ve mentioned that we are considered to be the best shop in our area.  We didn’t realize how significant our volume of parts orders was until we started to talk directly with manufacturers. 

It’s in the volume of orders and the grouping of them that save you money.  I was able to create listing of parts that are used every season, no matter how the season goes (barring disaster of course).  We then had the information of how we could order in bulk (basically fill a shipping container) and significantly reduce shipping costs.

After that we contracted the manufacturer directly to fill these orders.  At the end of the day, with volume discounts, it saved us about 35% on parts costs.  We transferred 20% of those savings to our customers and that is what ended their concerns about the boys’ possibly price gauging.  I don’t think that the shop has had a bad month since we made that happen.  It was a lot of work though.  Kerri actually helped during the process because she had some import connections.  She and I clicked, and our friendship/client relationship started.  I remember that Ian had to spend two weeks in Mexico to get the deals signed.

I say all of this because I find myself thinking of potential divorce.  I’ve been useless all morning and I’m writing this during my lunch break.  No, I’m not just thinking about money.  I’m a kick ass professional and I’ll be fine regardless of what happens.  I’m hurt though and I’m thinking about how I can make him pay.  I believe that the above affirms that I’ve been a big part of the shop’s success and, even though I’m not an owner, I feel that I’m due for some respect for how I’ve helped.

I’m feeling this way because I’ve realized how the two lovebirds have been executing their shenanigans.  It makes me sick to think about it TBH.  They pretty much organized their monthly rendezvous right under my eyes. 

I’ve said that we would do these monthly mountain adventures where we would take our dirt bikes or snowmobiles up to remote mountain locations.  It was originally Ian’s idea to create connections with customers and encourage the use of the vehicles we fixed.  I thought it was a great idea.  What I didn’t say was that Leah and Ian would always set the destination, and it was usually unattainable for us “Non-Experts”.  They would always charge ahead leaving me in a quasi no-mans land between them and the newbs.  The start was always slow, and they made sure that we knew proper safety and vehicle care.  Inevitably they’d get bored though and charge ahead to the destination.  That left me to putter along with the lower crew and make sure everyone was having fun.

They’d generally be apart from us for an hour or two, but they always returned to help the group set up lunch.  The decision would be made to then go further up or start returning.  They were always present and helpful during descent as that is the most dangerous part.

They clearly had the time to go have their fun.  It makes so much more sense when I think of this past Saturday.  The little gorge that caught Leah wasn’t so dangerous that falling in would cause major injury.  It was just, well, delaying, and would get you stuck if you didn’t have help getting out.  I was behind her, and I couldn’t figure out why she was taking the line so close to it.  There were plenty of safer lines than the one she chose.  Ian was over a ridge, so he didn’t see what happened.  She tried to power through the line, but didn’t make it and the back end of her bike fell down and dragged her in.

I now understand that she meant me to be the one to fall in while she zipped over the ridge.  She could have then had her fun with Ian, and they would eventually “save” me on their return.  It’s clear that her failure and my ability to help her out just triggered the guilty response she had.

I tried to call her a few times this morning and even sent her a: ***Please Respond to Me!*** text.  I ended up calling Rob (her man).  He’s an event coordinator at the resort she works at, so he almost always answers his phone.  He said that Leah had a planned vacation this week and even he couldn’t contact her.  She’ll be back this Sunday.  My only thought, and yeah, I’m a witch, is that she’s aborting her affair baby right now.

I’m heading home after work today and I plan on confronting my coward of a husband.  I’ll give everyone an update after it happens.

As always, thanks for your advice and support.",8,1729010603.0,stories,8,0.91,False

But in making that joke, I told her that it has occurred to me (and I could be wrong) in the 8 years I've been a lurker/user of this sub, I've seen a lot of ""My TBM husband is having a difficult time with my faith transition and is doubling down,"" type posts.

NOT ONCE! Lol

Me and my boyfriend were talking and he called me mom accidentally. I laughed it off and said we’d talk about it later. I had two ish bottles of wine and was pretty drunk for the ride home. During the ride we started talking about him calling me mom and ended up having a big blow out fight. I’m sure being drunk added fuel to the fire but his mom has been an ongoing argument for us. 

My boyfriend and his mom are very close. In my opinion they are to close. My boyfriend is the type of person to do little things to make you feel cared about and my boyfriends mom often treats his nice gestures as something she is entitled to. It feels like she is competing with for his attention and love. For example he might make me a coffee but if his moms there she’ll need one too. She might not even want coffee but because he’s doing something nice for me he needs to do it for her. It seems so small but all the little things together have made this an issue for me. Of course I understand he loves his mother but that’s a different type of love in my opinion. It feels like he is there to serve/ please her and I hate it. 

Some extra facts-  he lives at home, drives her car, snaps her everyday, and is “told” what to do by his mother daily. ( instead of saying something like it’s warm out maybe you don’t need a sweater she might say that he can leave the house in a sweater) 

Anytime I have tried talking about this with him he says that I just don’t understand their relationship. Now, he called me mom and it felt like he’s reconfirming the stuff I’ve been arguing with him for weeks. Is this normal or am I completely delusional? I feel like if he isn’t willing to put some separation between them then I won’t be able to stay with him. But I also feel like it’s not my place to tell him it’s weird. We haven’t talked since our argument yesterday and I don’t know if I can yet. Am I making this into a bigger issue then it is?

I'm looking for their instant french vanilla product (not kcups). I found it, but I'm not sure if it's like the box that I got, hence why I'm here to get answers from you guys with Tim Hortons experience.

The one I originally tasted (box), which was referred to me, is:

**Tim Hortons Hot Chocolate Assorted Variety, French Vanilla & Cappuccino, 30x28g, 15 Packets** - [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H8D2WC3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H8D2WC3)

The price doubled, so I'm not looking to buy that again until it drops to the original price I last bought it as. They aren't the kcup stuff which I heard has a different taste because they use a different creamer or something.

I found two different (can) listings which I believe are TH FV instant coffee:

# 1 - [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O48TRG/](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002O48TRG/)

# 2 - [https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Hortons-Vanilla-Cappuccino-Beverage/dp/B008DUT3PM/](https://www.amazon.com/Tim-Hortons-Vanilla-Cappuccino-Beverage/dp/B008DUT3PM/)

Are these the same product?

Is the product listing on #2 incorrect? It says ""decaffeinated"" so I'm very confused. If you scroll down to the ""Compare with similar items"" table, you'll see it says decaffeinated. I much rather caffeine btw.

The reviews are pretty bad for #1, saying it's mostly white powder. I don't remember it being like that when I bought the box. The box French Vanilla tasted really good but I don't think it was too strong when it came to the caffeine (it couldn't really keep me up; felt more like drinking it for the taste).

And the product listing says it's decaffeinated for #2, so I'm worried. But maybe the french vanilla instant coffee is supposed to be decaffeinated? I wouldn't doubt it. But if that's true, I'll order #2.

1g4btr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1g4btr9/please_help_me_understand_am_i28f_being/,Please help me understand am I(28F) being controlled/emotionally abused by my partner(30M),"My partner Josh and I have been together for a little over a year now. Things have started wonderfully. I didn't anticipate any relationship in my life at the time we met, but valued the way we connected over the topics we could discuss.

Then I noticed how caring he was. He would help out everybody with small things (for example, holding the door, taking the trash out, etc.). I saw it as a genuine wish to ease others days. He behaved the same towards me, even better, which at times felt like he was reading my mind.

Now, at that time, I had some personal issues and also went really low with my health, like never before. He ended up being very upfront with wanting me to tell him the personal issues, saying that he could see something was going on on my side, even though barely anyone noticed. I trusted him, reluctantly at first, but then quickly explained what's happening and he jumped right in to help me with that, he even helped with my health and I got better really fast, though I was in a need of a recovery period.

Soon after that, we ended up being in a relationship and living together. He said himself first that I will probably be a mess for a quite the time so he didn't expect profound intimacy nor me being completely trustful towards him, nor calm most of the times. That ended up being true (I denied it at first, thinking none of it is going to be a problem, but it somehow ended up being that way).

To make it shorter, I'll just point out things that started bothering me more and more, but I can't pinpoint if that is normal or not. I'd like to point out that I can get frustrated at times, but usually it takes a lot to shake up my calmness. I apologize whenever I'm wrong and try to learn from mistakes. He acts the same, but here are some things I can't shake my head off of:

1. We had a major fight on a vacation, and though I don't remember at all how it started, I remember him messaging both of our mothers about the fact that that happened and how I decided to split up with him (I asked him not to involve our family when he said he will, for obvious reasons) (P.S. our families know each other, they are close, so it wasn't out of the blue to contact them). We resolved our issue and he was very apologetic about contacting family and blamed it on being hot-headed and me also being very intense at that moment.

What stuck with me from that incident is that he phrased something along the lines that I should not be irrational with my behaviour/words next time if I don't want it to go south (like contacting family), as he also gets hot-heated. To me it is still strange, as we talked before that about how wrong it usually is to notify third parties about our issues. Because they won't forget, at least. For example, my mum really grew fond over Josh, but still remembers that incident and mentions it sometimes.

2. Intimacy has been a hell for both of us. He has a huge libido, I had it before as well, but after I went through personal issues before him, it affected my libido after we met and started dating. Add on top of it my declined health - I have close to zero wish for the intimacy. We did have amazing times when we began dating, but I slowly pulled out of it more and more and now I don't want it at all.

The thing that drives me away is that he understood completely in the beginning, that I need space with that, but he never stopped initiating multiple times in a day. All harmless cuddling ends up with a request for more. Not just a request, but he actively continues to touch me even when I say no. Lots of times I need to get defensively angry for him to stop so he stops, making a long face, saying how hard it is for him without the intimacy. And he doesn't masturbate (views it as an emotional cheating). That makes me always feel guilty but also sad how my boundaries are pushed until I get, well, angry (?). Then he proceeds with questions about oral sex, asking if I can't do penetrational sex, can I relieve him orally and why I don't.

The thing is, even his touch started feeling like I can't stand it at all, because it always ends up with advances even though he knows I can't.

But, he continues to talk to me dirty, asking if I will be his submissive woman, and points out that he doesn't want submissive except for the bedroom. But recently, he started telling me shady things like submissive woman doesn't necessarily mean bad, that I should put the ball down at home as well and let him take the upper hand more with some decisions. And then he proceeds saying how submissive is the one in control, as for example, in bed, when it says no, everything stops. (Yet, I have to beg and get angry to stop his cuddling advances.)

What triggered me today is how we were outside on a coffee and he spent majority of the time watching BDSM and slutty lingerie for me online to order and asking me which I'd like and how he can't wait for the future to have his 'little submissive slave' wearing that at home, and all I wanted was a normal conversation. I can't take that sexual advances anymore, I need just pure compassion. And he... well, he always points out how it is hard for him to stay always calm as he is pent up for months now. And I never felt so physically resentful of a touch before, as I am now. Used to think it's because of the disturbances I had before, but now I think it's maybe because of him?

3. Can't help but notice how he sometimes tells white lies to other people as to cheer them up. Those are small compliments, but I know for a fact he doesn't mean them usually. I once asked him about that and he responded with how sometimes people need a little bit of a push to be positive about the day/life. To me it feels like I can't trust him as he tells those so convincingly I can't help but think how it affects his integrity.

4. My alone, productive time, used to be tied closely with being outside on a cup of coffee learning, reading, playing on my own. Once we started living together, I asked him would he have issues if I sometimes went alone to the coffee shop. He responded in a way that it would be okay, but he would be sad without me, and overall, won't be as happy as he is when we are together. Initially I thought it is just because we just started living together, but today, after a long time, I went out on my own for a coffee on a work break. We work close to each other so we often go on lunches together and also very often end up going home together. When he called me to check what's up during that coffee, I said where I was and he blew up, saying that he could go home earlier if I let him know and I should've let him know. Keep in mind, he usually doesn't go home that early but somehow could today. I asked him why he didn't tell me he could go home that early, as I wouldn't want him to wait that long for me. And he said he didn't want to interrupt me as he thought I was busy. I confronted him telling that this seems not to be the issue and he is diverting his true anger on me going out alone for a coffee. Just yesterday, we spoke about it again and he said that I'm not a college student so that a coffee shop would be a place for me to learn or have alone time, but if I want it, I could go. He even asked me do I feel sorry for him wasting an hour on waiting for me. I said I didn't know he was free and he could just let me know. To which he responded I should've let him know first where I was and to promise him I'll do it from now onwards.

5. He always gives me compliments on my looks and outfits. But recently, started saying something along the lines that I don't need makeup because I am beautiful to him. Also, that he first saw me in a hoodie and it suits me better than casual business style or dresses (which I like more).

All of it to me seems like huge red flags coverted really deep and that is why I need your help. I would give more examples, but I see I wrote a lot already, so thanks for reading. Wanted to point out for final words, mostly our relationship is filled with amazing moments, he is always doing everything he can to make me happy, but those things I can't align with his character.

TLDR: Partner (30M) and I (28F) have a wonderful relationship except that I can't forget how wrong our arguments sound when I rewind back, that gets me thinking was it a love-bombing that is transfering to the controlling issues.",1,1729009667.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

1g4bqhl,https://www.reddit.com/r/dyspraxia/comments/1g4bqhl/driving_typing_stairs_advised_to_look_into/,"Driving, Typing, Stairs - Advised to look into Dyspraxia ","Hi, I'm hoping to gain some insight. *(Mods - I am aware of the weekly megathread, but would prefer to make a post of its own so I can get back to it easier - hope this is okay!)*



First off, I have ADHD (diagnosed 2y ago - medicated, and yes, it's the right dose). I've been really struggling with driving, and have posted to an ADHD subreddit a couple of times venting my difficulties.  



Quite a few people have mentioned that some of my problems ring bells for Dyspraxia, so I'm finally posting here in hopes of getting further opinions. 



Before I continue, here are links to my full posts in case anyone wants full context:   
1. [Driving - 'Reading' other cars/lanes/etc  ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/s/krNUizTaCR)(btw, I'm in the UK)  
2. [Muscle memory - Gear changes, stairs, typing ](https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/s/QWZFcy6ZE0)



So, in post 1, I describe this frustrating thing that happens in front of me when I use a roundabout.  
""I feel the same way trying to read cars, lanes and indicators at roundabouts as a dyslexic would feel reading words. Everything just suddenly jumbles up.""



In post 2, I talk about how my 'muscle memory' is flawed - I have to look at my feet when I walk down stairs, I have to look at my gearstick to know where the gears are, and constantly mis-type / hit wrong shortcuts on my keyboard (despite being an avid computer-lover all my life).

  
Other difficulties I may not have mentioned:  
- chronic mix up between Left and Right - even more so than I additionally thought. It's not just having to work hard to figure out the right one when somebody tells me, but even when I'm speaking directions out loud, I'll be physically pointing left but verbally announcing 'right'. 

- In a similar respect, Parking is a nightmare, especially when it comes to 'straightening up'. I just cannot identify which way the wheel needs to steer to correct my current position. (as well as by how much, etc).

- I think my spacial awareness could also be a problem... but, I'm not sure. One contradiction is that I can pack my groceries perfectly into a shopping bag so that everything tessellates and stacks perfectly, first time. I get some sort of tetris vision with that.  but driving, moving furniture, etc - I can't seem to judge what fits.

- slow reaction times - I need a more advanced warning than others because it takes my brain longer to tick, register, and 'do'. Like, if I'm pouring milk in your coffee, you're gonna have to tell me stop twice as soon as anyone else.

  
So - with all these in mind (and thank you if you read my linked posts), what are your thoughts? Does anyone here relate?   
  
Do these struggles click in with potential Dyspraxia? Please let me know if there is anything else I could evaluate about myself to get more insight / rule it out.

We do love each other and care about each other a lot but want to address the toxicity we have experienced in the past. One of those ways is by maintaining autonomy and this is something he believes would support that for him. He’s a behavioral health specialist and cares deeply about mental health.

1g4bmgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/christianblanco/comments/1g4bmgo/world_hunger_games_23rd_hunger_games_pregames/,World Hunger Games: 23rd Hunger Games: Pregames,"The parade arrived earlier than anticipated, and both tributes and mentors gathered at the Avenue of Tributes. As most groups had arrived ahead of schedule, many mentors chose to socialize. Savannah Pickett, victor of the 6th Hunger Games, caught up with Jase to discuss a potential alliance, gesturing towards her mentees Blossom and Rio (11). Zoe admired Rio's muscular build, while Linker felt sympathy for twelve-year-old Blossom's empty gaze. He attempted to lighten the mood with a quip about their vine-adorned tree costumes: ""If those vines get any tighter, they might just strangle them—unless they're into that sort of thing."" Savannah suppressed a laugh, conceding their new stylist had missed the mark. Jase, unable to promise anything, mentioned he would attempt to arrange a non-aggression pact for the first day of the games. Upon Savannah's departure, Zoe felt a sense of intimidation by District 2's volunteers, Madeline and Hermes (2). Jase remarked that District 2's tributes were generally commendable and could be valuable allies. Linker, however, was intrigued by District 1's tributes, Lyndana and Marco (1), humorously likening Marco's tattoo-laden chest to a warehouse bathroom stall. This joke elicited laughter from Jase and Zoe. Jase noted that following the 3rd Quinquennial Quell, District 1 was experiencing a political renaissance, making them a potential alliance. In the time remaining before the parade, Zoe engaged in parade strategy talks with Jase, while Linker talked with Kandy over his microphone costume.

In the midst of this, Martin Bogotá (victor of the 21st Hunger Games) found himself in an awkward and quite embarrassing predicament when Aura decided to drop by. Following her were Sherpa and Ishan. Sherpa offered a timid nod to Martin, which was reciprocated. Aura began to flirt openly with a disinterested Rio (11), much to Ishan's astonishment. She gestured towards the cherries on his vines and left everyone aghast with her comment, “I wouldn’t mind popping your cherry and sucking on the pit.” Rio, repulsed, retorted that he had a boyfriend back home, and Ishan chimed in with, “And a sense of dignity here too.” Aura, offended, punched him in the arm and stormed off. Sherpa apologized for the incident, and Martin advised him to learn when to put his foot down. He comforted a scared Blossom (11) as Ishan and Sherpa made their way back to their chariot. Sherpa was briefing Ishan for the parade when he noticed Aura was missing. Suddenly, there was a commotion near the District 7 chariot. Aura had apparently attempted the same flirtatious act on Spruce T. (7), nicknamed by Artemis to avoid confusion with his mentor, Spruce Queensberry (victor of the 19th Hunger Games). Aura's advances seemed to be successful, and she and Spruce T. began to kiss. Cherry (7), Spruce T.’s district partner, was horrified, while Spruce chuckled to himself. Vixen Furtherson (victor of the 14th Hunger Games) separated them and knocked Aura to the ground. Aura casually dusted herself off and rushed back to her chariot, ignoring the stunned expressions from Districts 8 and 9. Ishan looked on, shaking his head in disapproval as Aura rejoined him.

The parade began, and the career districts lived up to expectations. Lyndana and Marco (1) captivated the audience with their glittering Transatlantic Gatsby-themed costumes. Their chemistry was a refreshing change after the previous year's controversial Remy. District 2 presented a dignified show with their ancient Greek philosopher attire, paying homage to the last year's games. When District 3 appeared, their tributes leapt into action. Zoe initially smiled and waved, then attempted to move the vinyl disc on her recorder-themed costume. As she turned the wheel, a casual drumming sound emitted. Che realized she had to continuously spin the record herself and tried to pose while keeping the record in motion. Yet, it was Linker who stole the show. His microphone costume boosted his voice as he delivered courteous catcalls to the crowd. His most popular remarks included ""You look like you never leave the toilet seat up,"" ""You can probably recite the alphabet backwards,"" and ""You seem like you don't need coffee to be productive"". Zoe's accompanying soundtrack added a playful touch to the stand-up act, prompting some spectators to eagerly beg for a comment from Linker. Peering at them, Linker lost his balance but was saved from falling by Zoe, who quipped into his amplifier, ""Butter fingers? More like butter toes am I right?"" to which Linker responded with a supportive pat on the back.

The subsequent districts proceeded without a hitch. The sole mishap occurred when Jean (8)'s flowing gown snagged on the chariot wheel, tearing away much of it and revealing her upper thighs. As District 10 emerged, Aura immediately endeared herself to the Capital, waving, spinning, and growling flirtatiously. Ishan attempted to appear more lively, but was cautious of Aura's antics, suspecting an ulterior motive. In response, he tried to outshine her with bows and tapdancing. Aura, noticing his efforts, obstructed his view of the audience. Ishan pushed past her to continue his performance. This began a comical back-and-forth as they each tried to block the other from the Capital's view. This went on for the majority of their parade time until Aura ended it by stepping on Ishan's foot. Ishan considered retaliating, but the parade had ended, and it was time for the president's address.

This year marked a special presidential welcome as Aloysius Walt took the stage for the first time as the newly elected president. President Walt's address broke away from the norm established by his predecessor, President Rain. He commenced by expressing gratitude to the attendees and acknowledging the stylists for their excellent work. A special mention was made for his daughter, Florenzia Walt, who started her first year as a stylist for District 9. He honored all stylists and gamemakers for their pivotal roles in orchestrating the Hunger Games, vowing to collaborate closely with the latter to continue the Golden Victor narrative. Despite being characterized as stern and serious by former colleagues from his tenure as Head of State of Affairs, as reported by The *Juicy Tidbits* podcast, Walt's lighter approach to tributes was unexpected yet well-received. Concluding the ceremony, he announced District 1 as the recipient of *Blanco Fashion Magazine’s Best Dressed* title for their *Transatlantic Gatsby*-themed costumes.

After the parade, Linker and Zoe were exhausted and chose to unwind on the couch. Jase and Adam felt immense pride in their performance. Kandy, who had been relaying live comments about their entrance, was astounded to find them as the top trending district. The bulk of the praise was for Linker's humorous flattery and Zoe's daring rescue. Adam wondered why he hadn't showcased his impressions yet. Linker reasoned that doing so would alert the other tributes and the Capital prematurely. Zoe concurred, noting that even seemingly superficial tributes from District 1 were smarter than they let on. Linker's concerns were particularly focused on two tributes: Hermes (2) and Aura (10). Adam found Aura's inclusion puzzling, given her pre-parade antics. Zoe brought up a book she'd read on the Commodity Wars, which detailed the Night Women Cult, a faction of lethal women who nearly toppled the Black Forest region by using their seductive bodies and stealth to steal supplies and carry out assassinations. Jase praised Zoe's insight and urged them to keep an eye out for potential dangers in training. Their night concluded with Capital cake and hot cocoa. Linker entertained with impressions of Mayor Hashimoto and Jase, cracking jokes that had Adam laughing until cocoa spewed from his nose.

In the District 10 apartment, Ishan was seething with anger after being publicly humiliated by Aura during the parade. Aura insisted that she provided a comedic highlight that the Capital adored. Ishan, however, was unconcerned, claiming his toe was still throbbing. Seeking support, he turned to Sherpa, who was cradling Dylan at the bar. Sherpa acknowledged that while the injury wasn't good, the stunt had indeed boosted their popularity. Ishan countered that it only enhanced Aura's reputation, succeeding solely because the Capital was oblivious to her ""selling herself like a common streetwalker."" Aura chuckled, claiming her antics were a test of the boys' intelligence. She pointed out that Rio (11)'s fury and Spruce T. (7)'s lust proved their lack of wit. Sherpa, puzzled by her rationale, questioned the need for flirtation and kissing to make such observations. Aura cryptically replied, ""The woman’s mind is a mysterious place,"" asserting she never gives herself freely. Ishan muttered ""You gave yourself to that peacekeeper Chad pretty quickly"", to which she mockingly expressed shock at his bold claim. Ishan loudly accused her of infidelity, which she vehemently denied, turning to Sherpa for his opinion. Ishan attempted to convince Sherpa of her manipulative nature. Overwhelmed, Sherpa excused himself, retreating to his room, emerging only after Ishan flipped Aura off and retired himself to his room. Aura then served Sherpa tea, apologizing for the ordeal and expressing gratitude for his kindness. In a gesture of goodwill, Sherpa offered her the opportunity to hold Dylan, which she gratefully accepted.

Training day arrived, and all tributes rose from their slumber. Their uneventful journey to the training center left fans of the Juicy Tidbits podcast longing for drama. In the District 10 apartment, tension simmered as Aura and Ishan had breakfast, and Sherpa fed Dylan. A comical exchange unfolded in the elevator, thanks to Linker. Zoe gestured towards a peacekeeper with a heart tattoo over his eye. Linker grinned, praising the tattoo with a quip, ""I bet you see love everywhere you go."" The peacekeeper maintained a stoic facade, yet a subtle smile escaped, captured by both cameras and Linker. Exiting the elevator, Linker sent a playful kiss his way. Zoe, unamused, told him to grow up. Once the doors shut, the peacekeepers' contained laughter burst, unseen by the departing tributes.

As the tributes assembled in the training center, Training Master Troy van Stomm (victor of the 5th Hunger Games) arrived to deliver the standard briefing on the rules. The majority of the tributes conducted themselves properly, listening intently. During the speech, Aura's attention was on surveying the tributes; she noticed Ishan fixated on the Training Master. Stealthily, she reached out and nudged him, causing his fall into Harmon (9), who was directly in front. Troy cautioned Ishan to exercise more caution as he assisted Harmon to his feet. Ishan shot Aura a glare before refocusing on Troy. Once Troy finished his address, he released the tributes and proceeded to visit his fellow victors.

Ishan swiftly made his way to the survival station, seeking to avoid Aura. Fortunately, Aura had opted for the yoga station first. For the first couple of hours, he honed his survival techniques, becoming the first tribute to ignite a fire using just two sticks. As he attempted to shift focus to shelter construction, he noticed an emerging alliance between Districts 5 and 11. Observing from a distance, he saw Hydra (5) instructing Rio (11) in knot-tying, while Blossom (11) and Torro (5) collaborated on setting rodent traps. Engaged in a plant identification quiz, Ishan eavesdropped on their conversations. He felt uneasy being so close until he caught wind of their conversation about potential threats. While the career districts were the obvious concern, Rio expressed a keen interest in eliminating Aura, citing her previous advances. Blossom concurred, drawing parallels to a bully from her school days. This revelation prompted Ishan to consider joining them. He approached, offering his fire-making skills to the alliance. However, Rio (11) was adamantly opposed and dismissed him. Ishan attempted to justify his presence, claiming a shared animosity towards his district partner, but to no avail. Feeling rejected, Ishan retreated to the camouflage station.

Zoe felt no urgency to visit the survival station and instead opted for the yoga station to stretch. There, Aura was already in a downward dog pose. During her stretching, Aura caught Zoe off guard by commenting on her ponytail, likening her to a librarian. Zoe confirmed she was, indeed, a librarian. Aura laughed, noting the scarcity of bookworms in District 10. Zoe dismissed Aura's tactics, ""I see what you're doing and it's not gonna work. I don't ally with floozies."" She then proceeded to the knife-throwing station, where after an hour, she successfully hit the target. Aura appeared again, attempting to engage Zoe in conversation, expressing surprise at not finding her at the electronics station. Despite Zoe's annoyance at being followed, she retorted that she had no need for electronics. Aura then picked up some knives and silently landed several bullseyes, but Zoe was unfazed. Frustrated, Zoe questioned why Aura was pestering her instead of joining the careers. Aura expressed her desire for a smart ally, casting doubt on Zoe's partner, Linker. Zoe saw Linker at the strength station, struggling with lighter weights but strategically positioning himself near the career tributes. Zoe defended Linker's intelligence by suggesting he shared traits with their mentor. Aura mocked the idea of a twelve-year-old winning the games, but Zoe, unfazed, simply walked away.

Linker never lingered at a station for more than forty minutes, always silently tinkering with items before shifting to another spot. His only interests were in learning fishing knots and archery. After lunch, he headed to the electronics station to assemble a sound speaker, muttering to himself while engrossed in his work. When Zoe inquired about his progress, Linker claimed he was absorbing a lot and keen to return to the apartment. Zoe exposed his ruse, aware of his station-hopping and assuming he wasn't learning anything. Linker clarified, ""I am learning, just not new skills."" He revealed that had been practicing archery as his weapon but more importantly overheard other tributes while at the stations. He suspected Lyndana (1) might be battling a morphling addiction, noting her tremors resembled ""playing a piano nobody could see."" Zoe turned to look and sure enough, Lyndana's shaky hands botched a knife throw. Upon further questioning, Linker disclosed that Districts 1, 2, and 4 had formed an alliance intending to eliminate Lyndana early. Zoe lamented, ""It's Jase's games all over again.""

Linker changed the topic to inquire about Zoe's training. She shared her encounter with Aura and expressed confusion about Aura's interest in her. Linker speculated that Aura might be seeking an unconventional alliance and saw them as suitable partners. Zoe was pleased that she seemed to underestimate him, but Linker remained doubtful. He reasoned that if Aura had singled him out to Zoe, she likely had noticed his activities. Zoe was hesitant to form an alliance with Aura, but Linker proposed they consider it due to their lack of alternatives. He pointed out Aura's combat prowess and their own valuable defensive skills. ""Besides, anyone willing to volunteer is bound to have some tricks up their sleeve,"" he added. Zoe reluctantly agreed, but on the condition that Linker must be the one to approach Aura. As Linker worked on the sound speaker and Zoe visited the adjacent first aid station, she heard him muttering. When she asked about his actions, Linker began to respond but then noticed Aura observing them from the axe-throwing area. He stealthily approached Zoe, advising her to be silent because the ""dragon lady"" was watching them. Whispering, he revealed that he spied on the careers to listen to their voices. Initially puzzled, Zoe soon grasped what he said.

As the day neared its end, Ishan completed his camouflage training and attempted to leave. Suddenly, Katrina (4) stopped him, insisting he apologize for his remarks about her. Confused, Ishan tried to clarify, but Katrina wouldn't hear it. She challenged him to a sword duel for suggesting she smelled ""fishy."" Despite Ishan's reluctance, she was adamant and pulled him to the dueling pad. Training Master Troy, preoccupied with scolding Dunham (6) for hitting his district partner Penny (6), failed to intervene. By his arrival, the duel had commenced. Katrina dominated, concluding the duel with a score of 14/1. Leaving the station, Ishan encountered Aura, who mockingly commended him for scoring a point. In frustration, Ishan tackled her, landing a punch before Troy intervened, escorting him to an isolation pod. Aura, dusting herself off, was halted by Linker and Zoe. Linker teased her for spying, dubbing her a 'peeping Tammy,' aware she sought intelligence over strength. Aura acknowledged his insight, noting that the Golden Victor era demanded more than mere strength. Linker quipped ""Especially if it's anything like your partner's punch."" After discussing it with his partner, Linker proposed an alliance to Aura, which she accepted, promising aid in the upcoming bloodbath. They exited the training center feeling good about themselves.

The following morning, the training assessments commenced, and the gamemakers were eager to see the tributes' skills. As with the previous year, a higher number of tributes achieved elevated scores. Eight tributes earned an eight or above. Hermes (2), Katrina (4), and Aura each scored a 10. Marco (1), Madelina (2), and Pier (4) all secured a 9. The score reveal brought two major surprises: Zoe and Rio (11) both earned an 8, with Zoe matching Jase Toliver for the highest score ever by a District 3 tribute. Another shock was Lyndana (1) scoring a 5, the lowest for a tribute from that district. Linker's score, rumored to be highly contested, ended up being a 6. Ishan was on the lower end with a 4, while Kera (12) had the year's lowest score of 3.

In the District 3 apartment, Zoe was surprised by Aura's score and admitted that Linker was correct about the need to ally with her. Adam praised their efforts but cautioned them to remain vigilant. Linker suggested that with Zoe's score of eight, they might ""send the heifer and her to the slaughterhouse"" sooner rather than later. This remark sent both tributes and Adam into fits of laughter. Jase, visibly irritated and sitting at the bar, told them to quiet down. He acknowledged their success but warned against arrogance, reminding them that the toughest challenges were yet to come. Zoe retorted that they were merely trying to enjoy their final days and advised him to back off. Upset, Jase left the room, taking a bottle of *Boastful Brandy* with him. Adam offered an apology for Jase, noting that mentoring tributes is typically stressful for victors, but Jase found it particularly difficult. Zoe expressed understanding regarding his father's imprisonment, but Linker silenced her, suspecting there was more to the story. Adam recalled that Jase needed to mentor a D3 victor to free his father, Jansen Toliver, from Wolvson Maximum Security Prison. Jase usually managed his emotions well, focusing on his mentees. Zoe inquired about the change, and Adam revealed that since Jansen's unexpected participation in the 3rd Quinquennial Quell and subsequent injury, Jase feared each year might be his father's last. Linker inferred that his compromised identity prevented Jase from visiting his father. Adam confirmed with a nod. Overwhelmed, Zoe ran out to find Jase. She was nearly detained by peacekeepers, but Jase returned just in time to demand her release. Back in the apartment, Jase apologized for his outburst, and Zoe apologized for not understanding his pain. Linker lightened the mood with his impression of Jase, lifting everyone's spirits and readying them for interview preparations.

The incident in the District 10 apartment was candy for fans of the Juicy Tidbits podcast. Sherpa commended Aura on her high score and acknowledged Ishan's effort. Aura insinuated her score could have been better had Ishan practiced with a weapon. Ishan retorted that she would have just interfered and attempted to make him look bad. He accused her of siccing the ""fishy girl"" on him, despite knowing he had never interacted with her. Sherpa inquired if there was truth to this. Aura casually sighed, remarking she hoped Ishan would learn from this. Sherpa pointed out that their cooperation was crucial as their actions now would determine their fate in the arena. Ishan declared he had no plans to ally with Aura after her actions. Aura teasingly questioned, “Who would trust you to watch their back? If the elevens didn't want you, no one would.” Ishan blamed her for their hatred towards him. He shouted, “You've rigged the reaping and had been sabotaging my chances since day 1. Do you hate me that much, or are you simply evil?” Both Sherpa and Aura were taken aback by the outburst. Aura smirked slightly, advising him to channel that ferocity into the games. Ishan insulted her and pushed her to the ground. Sherpa rose to intervene, urging calmness. Even young Dylan stood by Sherpa, growling at Ishan. Sherpa suggested they focus on preparing for the interview. Ishan clenched his fists, then collected Volumnia's suit for him and secluded himself in his room. Upon her return, Volumnia immediately felt the tension, watching Aura as she donned her costume and conversed with Sherpa.

The most anticipated night of the pre-games had arrived, and co-hosts Artemis Radcliffe and Capricorn Luther greeted the audience. Artemis dazzled in a shiny white dress, her hair and shoulders dusted with glitter, while Luther opted for a simple three-piece suit. He teased Artemis for her extravagant outfits, but she believed it made her feel like a princess. They showed keen interest in this year's contenders, highlighting a few who might uphold the Golden Victor tradition. Lyndana (1) regretted her low training score, attributing it to her addiction to morphling—a substance exclusive to District 1—offering a distinct viewpoint on its effects compared to the more common warmweed and the challenge of overcoming addiction. Marco (1) flaunted his tattoos, capitalizing on his sex appeal with remarkable success. Madelina (2) charmed as the girl-next-door, while her counterpart Hermes (2) remained easygoing, praising his mentor Annabeth.

Luther was more thrilled than Artemis to present what he believed to be District 3's most promising tributes since Jase Toliver. He welcomed Zoe onto the stage. She elegantly traversed the stage in a silver gown, adorned with a platinum buckle belt and diamond earrings. Artemis praised her belt and remarked on her recent favorable impression on the Capital. Luther inquired about her tribute score, which Zoe hinted at achieving through several bullseyes. The conversation turned to her role under overseer George Gable at the Capital Archives. Zoe shared that her early reading skills placed her on a waiting list in kindergarten. When she came of age, Gable took her under his wing to mentor her as a librarian, thus avoiding the grim warehouse work. Artemis probed for any confidential information she might have encountered, but Zoe maintained she had seen nothing restricted. She expressed her desire to return to her studies and, more crucially, to aid Jase in reuniting with his father. Her heartfelt story about the difficulties Jase faced after the recent quell moved the audience, and she rallied them with a chant of “Free Jansen!” Artemis shifted the discussion to Linker, questioning a potential alliance. Zoe confessed she was initially annoyed by his humor and envious of his popularity but acknowledged their 'malleable' strengths. She lightened the mood by defining 'malleable' for the audience. Luther concluded her appearance with applause, and Zoe's final chant of “Free Jansen!” resonated with the crowd.

Artemis hushed the crowd. While commending their enthusiasm, she announced it was time for the next guest. Her excitement was palpable; this person had sparked the most unexpected reaction to the reaping and had become a sensation on the runway recently. She introduced Linker to the stage. Striding across in a three-piece suit akin to Luther's, but with a red tie and a microphone brooch, Linker paused before sitting, eyeing Artemis's attire and stepping back dramatically. Inquiring about his reaction, he quipped, ""What happened? Did a unicorn throw up on you?"" The audience, along with Luther, erupted in laughter, leaving Artemis blushing. The interview's opening topic was Linker's humor. Artemis shared her astonishment at his reaping response. Linker recounted how his brothers joked about his slim odds that morning, not realizing his own volume when his name was called. Luther commented on how Linker's positivity and wit had won over the Capital. ""What can I say? I love making people laugh,"" Linker admitted. He shared that humor became a pillar in his home after the loss of his parents, with his older brothers raising him and his younger sister. He realized he had a knack for comedy after his impromptu jokes became popular at school, so he performed on a soapbox in *Gauntry Square* for extra money. Challenged by an audience member to be funny on the spot, Linker mimicked Jase Toliver, ""I hate this question. No other profession has to deal with that. You're a doctor, take out my appendix!"" His act, complete with a jacket rip and a goofy expression, sent waves of laughter through the crowd. His Jase impersonation was a hit, prompting calls for more. Artemis considered herself humorous, but Linker was quick with another jest, this time in Mayor Hashimoto's tone, ""My jokes rupture tummies. Your jokes make people cry for their mummies."" Luther and the audience busted our laughing, but Artemis's face was red in embarrassment.  Linker claimed those were the only voices he was familiar with, yet he expressed a desire to learn more should he triumph in the games. Amidst the ongoing laughter, a flustered Artemis hastily ushered Linker off the stage, which did not deter the audience from delivering the most thunderous applause of the evening.

Subsequent interviews ensued but none were as notable as Linker's. Katrina and Pier (4) displayed typical career confidence, while both Penny and Dunham (6) found it difficult to focus due to their warmweed withdrawal. A comical exchange occurred when Spruce T. (7) mentioned sharing his first name with his mentor, yet it failed to impress the audience. A slight surprise arose when Freda (9) contorted into a human pretzel, but her wheat field anecdotes were deemed dull. Similarly, her district counterpart Harmon (9) attempted humor akin to Linker's, but his stutter only served to embarrass him.

The hosts were growing weary after a series of uneventful interviews. Artemis, recognizing the next guest, felt a sense of relief at the prospect of an engaging tribute. She greeted Aura, who made a lively entrance in her yellow summer dress with orange sleeves and flower-adorned heels, blowing kisses and curtsying before taking her seat. Artemis remarked, ""Flamboyant flirtation is typically seen in District 1,"" to which Aura proudly claimed she was one of a kind. Luther, intrigued, questioned why the mayor’s stepdaughter, with a flourishing real estate career, would volunteer for the games. Aura confessed that despite the thrill of making money, she sought a more meaningful life and a clean slate from her criminal past. She also desired to join Sherpa in mentorship. She sang her praises to Sherpa for his friendship and the joy of petting his cub Dylan. Aura casually recounted tannery tales that led to run-ins with peacekeepers. Artemis noted Aura's contrasting feelings towards her job and mentor compared to her district partner. Aura nonchalantly responded, ""One doesn't have strong feelings for their ex, especially after they cheat on you."" She reminisced about their once enjoyable relationship, which added a touch of fun to her hectic career, until she caught him with a tannery maid, leading to their split. Wiping away tears, she confirmed to Luther her intention not to ally with her ex. Although she admitted to having an ally, she kept their identity secret for a surprise. Artemis vowed retribution on Aura's behalf and sent her off to a warm reception. Aura exited the stage as vivaciously as she had entered.

Artemis was more excited than ever to introduce their next guest. Luther rolled his eyes in response to her callous comments about him but introduced him nonetheless. Ishan carefully walked onto the stage wearing a brown suit with leather boots. The audience's reaction was a mix of cheers and jeers, the latter due to recent allegations. Ishan sat down, bracing himself for Artemis’s barrage of insults. Luther attempted to maintain civility by inquiring about his job at the tannery. Ishan described how he managed the tannery’s farm and occasionally worked the front desk. He began recounting a tale about driving a wild tiger away from a flock of sheep, but Artemis clearly showed disinterest. Ishan, annoyed, sensed she was more interested in his relationship with Aura. Artemis stated, “I’m certainly not interested in your claim that she cheated first. I know when a woman is being real.” Ishan retorted, “You wouldn’t understand. I was always loyal to her. I loved her, and she stabbed me in the back.” He revealed that she had been involved with peacekeeper cadet Chad Boreville, information he got from his friend Hocker, who had seen them near the reaping square. Ishan confessed to an affair with the tannery maid, but only because Hocker had overheard Aura planning to leave him. Artemis was skeptical, but Ishan quickly cited numerous complaints from tannery residents about her cruel methods of rent collection and labor supervision. Luther considered Ishan's honesty and asked about the aftermath of the reaping. Ishan accused Aura with tormenting him during the pregames, particularly mentioning an incident in the training room. Artemis taunted, “Why don’t you complain to your mentor then?” Ishan dismissed Sherpa as unhelpful, accusing him of being too ""chickenshit"" to defend him. Turning to the audience, Ishan declared his indifference to whether they believed him or not. What he did know was that the games had ways of bringing the truth out. He stormed off the stage and ended the bizarre interview.

The atmosphere in the District 3 apartment was cheerful following the interviews. Kandy sifted through the reviews, and everyone was thrilled to learn that Zoe and Linker had become the crowd's favorites. Linker, noted for his charm and remarkable impersonations, caught particular attention. Zoe questioned his decision to reveal them so early, contrary to his earlier statement. Linker, seeking to attract sponsors, admitted to changing his mind but confided in Zoe about other impersonations unknown to the Capital. Jase, preoccupied with thoughts of his father, was hesitant to get his hopes up. Adam raised the topic of Ishan's revelations, prompting Zoe to suspect some underlying truth, which led her to question their alliance. Linker reassured her of their ability to outwit Aura, citing her observation between Aura and the Night Women Cult. Linker trusted Zoe to think of something. After a comforting embrace, they settled down to view the interview recap together. Meanwhile, Adam and Kandy were comforting Jase, who was visibly emotional.

In the District 10 apartment, tensions were high. Aura was furious with Ishan over his allegations, yet he remained calm. He justified his actions by claiming he had disclosed the full truth to the Capital, and that peacekeepers would likely follow up. Despite Aura's insults and shoving, Ishan stood firm without retaliation. The commotion caused by Aura's shouting sent Dylan into hiding, leaving Sherpa frantically searching for him. Aura's attempts to provoke Ishan were pointless; he remained composed until she finished her tirade. Ishan then vowed, ""I swear on my family's grave, I will find a way to kill you and get revenge for all the misery you caused me."" With that, he retreated to his room, slamming the door behind him, disregarding Aura's mockery, ""You're not Chen, you imbecile."" Aura then relaxed on the couch with a *Raspberry Relent*. Sherpa asked if what Ishan said was true. ""What do you think?"" Aura countered. Sherpa was uncertain but longed for peace between them, hoping they could form a strong team like he and Mihika. Aura acknowledged Mihika's intelligence and conceded her desire for a clever ally. Grateful, Sherpa suggested Aura get some rest. She agreed and bid him goodnight.

The following morning, all tributes were transported to the arena for this year's games. With an uneventful breakfast, the broadcast quickly shifted to the countdown for the commencement of the games. This year's uniform, consisting of t-shirts, jeans, and sneakers laced with district colors, awaited inside the holding rooms. Zoe was lacing her sneakers when Jase came to see her. Overwhelmed with anxiety, Jase wished they didn't need to go. Zoe, understanding his stress, reassured him that she and Linker would do their best. Jase thanked them for being great students and shared his hope of reuniting with his father. After a comforting embrace and words of determination from Zoe, she entered her tube at the appointed time, bidding farewell with a wave. Meanwhile, Linker received encouragement from Adam. Despite their attempt at optimism, Linker was incredibly nervous, fearing he might be the first to fall due to his youth. Adam countered his fears, suggesting that it was time for a twelve-year-old to become a victor, a ""Golden Victor"" at that. Requesting one final impression, Linker channeled Hashimoto, humorously declaring, ""Never give up, never surrender your underpants unless you need a white flag."" Adam laughed, and after a final hug, Linker stepped into his tube.

Aura received an unexpected visit from Volumnia, who was unusually eager to talk. Aura's confusion grew as she wondered why Sherpa hadn't come instead. Volumnia dismissed the importance of his absence. Asserting her belief in Ishan, she ominously wished Aura a 'happy death.' Aura was confident in her chances and retorted that victory would have her laughing last. Volumnia responded, ""Sure, but who knows what will be waiting when you get back. Just remember, the Capital knows everything."" She vowed to make Aura's life miserable if she won. Taken aback yet defiant, Aura smiled, declaring her readiness for the challenge, and entered her tube with a rude gesture. In contrast, Ishan was visited by a nervous Sherpa, who was without Dylan. Ishan, feeling a profound emptiness, didn't care whether he lived or died. Sherpa tried to encourage him but Ishan wasn't listening. Ishan acknowledged his kindness and advice but lamented his lack of assertiveness against Aura. Sherpa didn't know who to believe and excused it to his social struggles. Ishan, empathetic, urged him to reflect. After a heartfelt embrace, Ishan expressed how nice it would be to have a friend. He saluted Sherpa and stepped into his own tube.",3,1729009142.0,christianblanco,1,1.0,False

1g4bl95,https://www.reddit.com/r/startrucker/comments/1g4bl95/only_18hrs_in_this_game_is_great_and_has_such/,"Only 18hrs in, this game is great, AND has such potential! What would you like to see in future? ","This game really caught me off guard, I expected a straight casual truck-sim with a space backdrop. Knew nothing about maintaining the ship, replacing cells and EVA'ing for repairs/loot or the mini gameplay systems around cargo weight, price changes and upgrades.

So far I've delved in and maintained my first save, despite going DEEP into debt from a few big fuck ups with oxygen, ship recovery costs and lost cargo etc. Now sat on a health 15k and able to really branch out. I've enjoyed trying to sync my contracts with the shop items available to maximise profit, and now started working through ship upgrades which seem very strong.

However, a few things I'd love to see included in future (or maybe I'll find them later in?) 

- Upgrades to add workstations / extra screens into your truck - 

  
1. A battery recharge station that you can upgrade for faster charge speeds and extra slots for more batteries - balanced by dragging a lot of power from your core cells / lowering battery health when recharged, meaning they're not infinite.

2. A Job board built into your cab, removing the need for docking so you can pick jobs up on the fly (does seem weird to have to dock just to accept a job on a screen anyway) - This would also show a galaxy map rather than just locations so you dont need to exit, check your map, then go back in to confirm. Maybe also allowing you to chain jobs, rather than needing to dock every drop-off.

3. A rudimentary Sat-Nav - You'd need to theme it on an old-school TomTom or something to fit the vibe of the game, but a very basic monitor on your dash (again, a purchased upgrade) that just gives you a rough arrow and possibly audio callouts to help navigate to the enterances of roads in systems (something I struggled with early was figuring out HOW to get to the right roads to get to the gate I wanted) This could also help with planning timings by showing a ""est time to arrival"" or ""be aware, speed camera here"" (why doesnt this game have speed cameras!?

4. Speed cameras or patrolling police to punish speeding. So far I havent been in ANY trouble for ignoring speed limits (although i tend to roughly follow them anyway) - Would just be another layer of immersion knowing some areas you can blast through but others you need to be good. Similar to real life.

5. Visual (or useful!) upgrades inside the ship. Lets have a mechanic that specialises in interiors. New dashes, new seats, new colourways inside maybe? Maybe cosmetic stuff we can buy from certain vendors like a hula girl, or an air freshener or even pictures/souveniers we can hang on our walls. (Maybe with an added 'glue' item to keep them in place lol) - ALSO, new spacesuits! Or ability to add better shelving and storage (a bit of rope would go a long way!)

6. A more 'survival' mode! When I saw the cab had a bed I thought maybe we'd need to sleep to save the game, or maybe use it as a 'rest' mechanic so you cant truck across the whole map in one drive. Adding something that factors in sleep, food and drink (and maybe even going to the toilet) would add even more immersion but be a toggle option (unless playing hardcore).   
This could add in an in-cab toilet area, rest-stop areas where you can park up out the way and possibly a rest-stop shop where you can buy varying food and drinks to take on your journey. We could then have upgrades and rarer items attached to this (energy drinks or coffee stave off sleep, but make you thirsty, big drinks replenish thirst but increase need to pee... better beds give better rest etc)

7. Lastly, More Music! The radio station SLAPS and I love pretty much the whole list, but it does get repetitive after an hour or so of playing. Either have this within new radio stations (maybe only in certain systems?) or the ability to purchase CD's/ Space cassettes from vendors and keep them in your glove compartment? Then you get to enjoy the stress of swapping music while doing 100mph.

  
What do you guys think! I really do think there is SO much potential in this game.

1g4bj1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1g4bj1f/being_chill_going_with_the_flow_isnt_working_for/,"Being ""chill"" & ""going with the flow"" isn't working for me. I'm getting almost no social invites. Should I intentionally try hard to get invited to stuff?","Throughout my life, I've never really deliberately thought about social skills and just went the flow. I've always been pretty chill and laid back. I never really tried hard and just made friends naturally and without putting in too much effort. Was never the post popular kid in school, but wasn't unpopular either.

However, this approach hasn't been working with me at the MBA. I've been kind, chill, and laid back in social interactions, but no one has really taken an interest to me. I asked a childhood friend of mine who is socially popular (he did HSW MBA) to give me the hard truth on why he thinks that is.

His theory is that people think I'm nice and I'm not doing anything wrong. But being nice and doing nothing wrong isn't ""enough."" In order to get people to invite me, I can't just do nothing wrong, but I have to provide social value. As in making people laugh, telling interesting stories, hosting events myself so people will reciprocate, having social hobbies, etc.

He said the MBA social scene IS transactional and there is a ""social currency"" system involved. It's more socially competitive than real where you can just stumble around like I did and still make friends with little effort. If you for example go out to cook for others, then they will keep you in mind for invites when they host their own parties or overnight trips.

He said for some people, these things come second nature because they've worked at these group dynamic skills since childhood and internalized them. But he didn't do that, growing up in a strict East Asian family. So he TRIED HARD. He legitimately tried very hard and put in a lot of deliberate, intentional effort.

He put lots of time into deliberately and intentionally studying and practicing social skills, to become funny, charismatic, and interesting. As in reading books, watching Charisma on Command, and practicing it deliberately. He put in lots of effort to learn fashion sense as well as go to the gym to get in good shape. He specifically learned to ski since ski trips are a huge social part of MBA programs.

He deliberately did things like hosted house parties, or did LinkedIn research on classmates to learn their background, get 1:1 coffee chats, and ask thoughtful questions. He'd very deliberately keep up to date on all the latest NFL, NBA, and other mainstream sports news. And he'd watch TikTok to see what's happening in pop culture and make some TikTok dances himself as it was a ""cool"" thing to show others in the MBA in the late 2010s.

So in reality, he was a people pleaser and a try hard. But on the outside, me made it seem like he was doing these things in a chill way and was being effortless with them. It made him likable to others. Over time, this became more natural to him.

But he said that yes, I shouldn't be chill, and I should secretly try VERY HARD since this ins't natural to me, but on the outside I should make it seem like I'm putting in no effort. With time, people will reciprocate and invite me to things.

He said socializing and networking is the most important aspect of the MBA, and these soft skills will carry over to post MBA careers like consulting or banking. So it's good to prioritize doing now.

1g4bimw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1g4bimw/ubiquiti_set_up_for_small_coworkevent_space/,Ubiquiti set up for small cowork/event space,"I'm in the process of opening a small wireless-only cowork space and event venue in a 3,800 sf warehouse with 12 ft ceilings and a wide open rectangular floor plan (45 ft x 85 ft). The concept is basically a glorified coffee shop with lots of comfortable seating, as opposed to the more corporate/office vibe of a WeWork that has lots of private offices, conference rooms, etc... I anticipate there will be no more than 50 users at a time, probably closer to 25 on average.

I have one gigabit fiber from Spectrum (the only ISP in this part of downtown) and my current plan is to purchase a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE with three U6 Pro APs. I'm told I have to use the Spectrum modem. There are no private offices, so the only wired connections I've planned are to the three U6 Pro APs (mounted equidistantly on the underside of the center beam) and a printer. What I'm trying to achieve is a high speed reliable network that is secure and that is relatively straightforward for a non-tech person to manage and troubleshoot. I appreciate any input/insight about the system I have in mind and its adequacy or lack thereof.
