1knksk9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1knksk9/sisterhood_breakdown/,Sisterhood breakdown?,"Thanks in advance for anyone who reads the tl;dr, it's hard to explain my weird situation. Nutshell: I'm not sure how serious an issue I'm having with my younger sister (by 3 years, she just turned 30), how upset she is, and what I should do about it. She's coming by the the house in a couple of days to pick something up, after we haven't seen each other or spoken in a fortnight, and I have no idea what to do. I fear I'm reading this wrong, and can't ask her without her having a meltdown or chewing me out, because she's a sensitive sort who processes emotions externally, and she doesn't like being the person on the back weak foot.

Quick set-up: the other week, my sister took me out for the weekend for a belated birthday trip, to another city a few hours away. Despite being much lower income atm than she is, I paid for our hotel and my own travel; she bought us dinner, breakfast and theatre/match tickets (which were very much appreciated by me). We spent the first day together just the two of us, then the second day met up with her bf & our dad to go to a sports game (womens' soccer)

The main issue: on our drive home at the end of the weekend, we stopped for a needed snack and drink. In the service station, my sister's boyfriend went to grab coffees before anyone of us could jump in and offer to--he's a generous guy who likes little gestures. My sister then turned to me and *hissed* at me that I needed to pay for everyone, and I'd better run across the service stations and hand her boyfriend my debit card in front of every other customer, which in shock I did. She seemed furious and like she was looking down on me, I've never experienced her act like that toward me before. It felt like a mask off moment. 

As I said, I'd paid for things on this trip and offered to, the most expensive hit in fact (a basic inner-city accessible hotel room for us both was over a hundred quid). Not to mention, I lost money thanks to her scheduling screw-up, not knowing where her bf would be with his car, resulting in me buying a fifty quid train ticket I didn't need or use (I didn't bring this up or complain once, though). Spending like this is rare and a lot for me, as I only work part-time due to health issues and home domestic elder care demands, and so I make much less than my sister and her man. 

So I have no idea where her ire was coming from. All I can think is that it's anxiety on her part, because her man recently left his job and is in limbo, but they still make bank and are in no financial danger or hardship, so wtf? She's also going on a girls-only friends' holiday next month, so perhaps she's been saving for that. She has no plans for marriage or kids yet, so I know it's not that.

Either way, her vent was really hurtful and took me aback, and two weeks later I'm still ruminating and unhappy about being treated that way, mostly because of the context (the weekend supposed to be about celebrating me...), and moreso sudden and public shaming of it all. I'd have felt better about it if she'd taken me aside in a bathroom or in the car and said something to me gently & privately, if she really felt like I was cheaping out or that I'm a broke mooch loser or something. We started out the trip gossiping and laughing like the best oldest friends, then not 48 hours ended up coldly not looking at each other or saying a word.

It's not like the rest of the trip was a disaster, either. Apart from that, all went ok as could be expected, and I stayed upbeat as I could, considering me & my sis are drifting apart in recent years (she noticeably went to sleep in the hotel at like 9 instead of chatting to me and catching up), plus she knows I don't really get along with our dad and I'm not the most outgoing sort or keen on events etc. Tbh when this plan was set up, I didn't want to go, and felt miffed that my sister had made my birthday plans to include other people and had made it so busy requiring travel. She didn't seem to notice or care about my discomfort, though. 

It's not even about the money, for me. It's that we used to know each other and read each other better. For more years than I care to admit, she was my only real friend, and after I've given her space to go off and live her life with other people, I still don't have many of my own (partly by choice). Up til a few years ago, I felt that my sister was the one person in life I could relax with and not worry about all that, but now it's sadly clear that things have changed. I feel disrespected, slighted and shamed by her to be honest, and don't feel able to speak to her atm. I even had a dream last night about her stabbing me in the mouth with a pocket-knife (I often have vivid dreams about other people, but rarely that violent or clear)

But because she confronted me with that same hostile hurt energy first, I don't know if or how I could be the real one at fault, and if there's anything I'm missing here. Ofc I understand her intention was good, and all weekend I masked for my life to make sure she didn't feel like her effort was wasted. I am someone who struggles with anxiety, Aspergers' and so on, making me highly self-conscious or hypervigilant of potentially boring people, or annoying them, or missing cues/context etc. 

So should I make it up first and assume fault/blame? I've considered paying her back unasked for the meals and tickets she bought, then just closing the matter--will that help, though? I don't want to escalate or make it a drama, nor do I want anyone to think I'm a leech. I have that big sister instinct where I want to take the fall or help her out, even though it's beyond my means and perhaps not even my responsibility in this case. However I also don't want to be treated like that in public ever again. And if it turns out my sister really thinks so little of me and finds it so easy to dogwalk me, I'm not sure I can get over this and see a way back to the deep ride-or-die friendship we used to share. I feel like I'm losing my only sibling and my closest person in life, over nothing or for no reason, and it's breaking my heart a little bit.

1knkmpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1knkmpa/virgin_cruise_pros_and_cons/,Virgin cruise pros and cons.,"Read this first before booking! 

My wife and I have been on over 30 cruises with 7 different cruise lines in the past 10 years therefore we feel that we can give a fair and honest review regarding Virgin Cruises. If you're considering upgrading to Rockstar status, DON'T DO IT!
Having Rockstar status with a  black bracelet and paying two to three times more money only gives you a larger cabin, unlike other ships, you get no additional or special treatment or priority for anything! We were actually told by a senior employee that everybody on the ship is treated equal. So save your money and do not waste it, just get a regular room with a balcony because you'll get exactly the same treatment as the people paying two to three times the money. 
The best way to understand Virgin is by breaking it down into pros and cons. Keep in mind we experienced Virgin Cruises as ""rockstars"".
PROS: No children. Nice, modern, clean rooms. Free champagne on departure day for one hour. The room attendant was very good. 
Cons: Delivery of the suitcases to our room was extremely late, the suitcases were finally delivered after asking and begging for them for several hours.
 Hard, uncomfortable metal chairs on the balcony, along with a very very small metal table not possible for two people to have and enjoy breakfast on.
Very long waits for elevators and all of the elevators were always  jam-packed full of people.
The ships design feels like you're in a mouse maze there is no open spaces and everything, feels extremely crowded.
With the exception of The Wake restaurant the other restaurant's food was sub-par. With the exception of the salad bar, the food in the ""Galley"" (Virgin version of a buffet) was basically cafeteria style food, not good.
Room service food options were extremely limited to coffee, alcoholic drinks, gummies,pretzels, peanuts and the option of chicken noodle soup. 
We were looking forward to experiencing the Gunbae restaurant but were extremely disappointed with the service and the food. Our server and food preparer just seemed like she didn't want to be there and she was rushing through everything. Believe it or not, she actually forgot to prepare and cook and serve fried rice at our dinner presentation! The food at Gunbae was very basic and the beef was subpar.
The pool was a joke! The smallest pool you will ever see on any cruise ship and it was packed full of people all day, everyday!  Good luck trying to find a lounge chair, apparently they have a 40 minute rule but never enforced it, there were people's belongings on lounge chairs for throughout the day, but God forbid you move their personal effects  so you could use the lounge chairs.
At Bimini we had the same problem, 0% chance of getting a lounge chair. As Rockstar status we went to the so-called Rockstar location and also there we could not get access to any lounge chairs. The so-called private Rockstar location at Bimini is total BS, all the different passengers were there eating and drinking and using the facilities. We mentioned it to the staff and they said there's nothing they can do because they cannot make any of the customers angry. 
Crew/ staff,  there was a large percentage of employees that were rude, very short and condescending when we asked them something.

We were told that Rockstar status was VIP. Even if you Google ""Rockstar status Virgin Cruise"" the answer is VIP.
We went to an evening poolside concert and went into the roped off VIP section to watch the concert. We were just standing there in the VIP section enjoying the concert and after about 10 minutes we were approached by two aggressive and rude security employees and were verbally assaulted and grabbed by the arm and physically removed from the VIP area. I explained to them clearly that we are Rockstar customers and have VIP status. And they answered back that we didn't belong in the VIP section and you had to leave. When we showed them our black bracelets they said ""you need to leave now!"" After looking around and observing the VIP section we quickly realized that everybody in the VIP roped off section was under the age of 40 so the only conclusion I can come up with is this Cruise line does not want business from older customers, they're obviously catering to the very young crowd. The only reason they asked us to leave is we did not fit the ""profile"" to be in the special section. We are both retired professionals in our 60s and have never been treated like this ever in our lifetime. This experience was extremely insulting, humiliating and embarrassing. We have traveled the world and have never been so disrespected! Shame on Virgin cruises! 
We will ""NEVER""go on Virgin Cruise again!!!!!!!

In closing, we recommend not risking having a terrible cruise experience. However if you insist on possibly having a bad experience, do not waste your money upgrading to Rockstar status, it does absolutely nothing for you, there are zero priorities, no special treatment, zero, nothing, nada!  We recommend that you do not book with Virgin, there are far better Cruise lines out there wilh excellent customer service and excellent food options.

**Background** 

I'm 34 years old with a long-term male partner, in NYC. We're both leaning childfree but I recognize I/we might change our mind in the future. We're very fortunate that our insurance covers elective fertility preservation (UHC) and decided to switch to the PPO plan this year to make the best use of it. 

My BMI is 22.7, non-smoker, don't work out, eat healthily, regularly get 7-8 hours of sleep, heavy drinker (1-2 glasses of wine a night), 2 cups of coffee a day. I didn't change anything about my lifestyle before starting the process, though I didn't drink alcohol once I started. I've had a Mirena IUD for 6 years but still get my period. My AMH is high but my periods are very consistent and I don't have any PCOS symptoms.

**Consultation**

I chose to go with Cornell as they are in-network, close by (for the Brooklyn office), and I use them for my other medical needs. I didn't look at other clinics/hospitals. Overall, I had a great experience with them.

My initial virtual appointment was in Jan. We met with our doctor in Feb who discussed embryo vs egg freezing, and suggested genetic screening which we thought was a good idea. We were pretty leery of freezing embryos given the political climate and because it locks us both in. My partner was also interested in semen freezing (Cornell does analysis but doesn't do cryopreservation itself; they will refer you to other places). We got our results in March which were clear, and I decided to go for egg freezing. 

Then, I went for my baseline scan which showed about 15 follicles per ovary, and an AMH of 7ng/ml. Note - I was verbally told this by my doc. Later I asked and a nurse said my LH and FSH were both around 6. The office gave me a comprehensive packet of what the estimated costs would be. They also submitted pre-authorization requests for coverage of the procedure and medication, and I got letters from my insurance in the mail. After attending the virtual class, I was told to call when I got my period and they'd schedule me in for May. (Cornell is closed June). I ordered my medication via Alto Pharmacy.

**Stim schedule - antagonist protocol**

I got my period on Thurs, called Friday, went in Sat as Day 1. My estrogen was at 23, and the technician said she saw about 6-7 follicles per ovary. 

* Day 1 and 2: 75 IU gonal-f, 75 IU menopur
* Day 3: Monitoring appointment (bloodwork only).  75 IU gonal-f, 75 IU menopur
* Day 4: Monitoring appointment - saw my doctor.  75 IU gonal-f, 75 IU menopur, 1 kit cetrotide (always in PM). Estrogen at 345.
* Day 5: 75 IU gonal-f, 75 IU menopur, cetrotide.  Note - I underdosed gonal-f to about 62.5 as I ran out in the 300IU pen.
* Day 6: Monitoring appointment. 62.5 gonal-f, 75 menopur, cetrotide
* Day 7: 62.5 gonal-f, 75 menopur, cetrotide
* Day 8: Monitoring appointment. 62.5 gonal-f, 75 menopur, cetrotide. 
* Day 9: Monitoring appointment. 100 gonal-f, 75 menopur, cetrotide. Estrogen at 1783.
* Day 10: Monitoring appointment - saw my doctor. He confirmed today would be the trigger day, the largest follicle was 21mm. He also said he saw about 10-11 follicles per side and that everything was looking great.  Cetrotide at normal time (8:45pm) + Lupron-only trigger at 1:40 am. Estrogen at 1929.
* Day 11: Pre-op appointment at 6:30 am. 
* Day 12: Retrieval at around 1pm, I was the last one of the day. Had to show up at the hospital at 11 am. Waiting around was a bit annoying but the process was very smooth and the nurses were lovely.

**Outcome**

22 eggs retrieved, 16 mature. 

Thanks to the low stims I think, the overall side effects were very minimal. While on stims I had a bit of bloating, brain fog, and exhaustion, but no pain. After the retrieval yesterday, I had a bit of cramping and gas but didn't even need to take additional pain meds. I drank a lot of electrolyte powder + miralax which seems to be helping too. This morning I woke up with a minor menstrual headache which isn't uncommon for me but had successful bowel movements.

**Misc Notes**

I wasn't sure what to expect given I have a high AMH; it seems like my team put me on a really gentle course of stims which honestly made the process very manageable. I started to obsess a bit about the numbers when different ultrasound docs gave me different counts; I'm really glad I got to see my doctor twice who really projected confidence without guaranteeing me specifics. The rest of the folks I saw were professional but clearly busy and trying to get through as many ultrasounds as possible that day.

In terms of the shots, the advice on here was very helpful with respect to menopur burns and the itch from the cetrotide; I found wiping the cetrotide area after the shot with an alcohol wipe really helped remove any itch/rash. 

Now that I've been through it and my partner and I understand the numbers a lot more, we've also decided to pursue embryo freezing later this year in addition. I'm really glad I did egg freezing first though.",2,1747346173.0,eggfreezing,1,1.0,False

Personally I feel the dress code change was a great move, in the sense that it promotes equality amongst us as co-workers, as everyone is wearing the same colour and same quality t-shirts (from the coffee gear). Even if its not same quality still, the same colour gives a consistent look for sure. Yes it may feel frustrating for sure, but as an employee in any workplace we have to adhere to their rules. If not Starbucks, lets say you are working in a corporate office, you have to follow dress code and wear formals to work even if you hate it. It is what it is, in any place of work. Even here in Canada, I have seen people following strict dress code for their offices. A friend of mine (also my former roommate )was working in an office as an admin and every single day she wore super professional clothes, with neatly tied hair and minimal makeup. She is a stylish diva outside her job but at her workplace she was always professionally dressed as required by her office. And many others do the same too. 

Yes, for shoes they should have provided us with water proof shoes and not expected us to purchase them on our own.

Before going any further: I've had an echocardiogram and holter monitor done in 2019 that shown no abnormal results. In February of this year, I had a 7d heart monitor that also showed normal results with rare <1% ectopic beats, with no runs of SVT, etc.

I've been dealing with what I suspected to be PVCs for a few years now, and nearly ALWAYS after eating or when I'm extremely bloated.

Last night, I had PVCs periodically for 4 hours. I'd say probably a couple every hour. I know that burden is still low, but I've never had them like that before. However, yesterday I did have coffee and was particularly more stressed/anxious at work than I think I usually am. Blood pressure and pulse was fine during this time as well.

My question: if I had an echo done 6 years ago, a recent 7d heart monitor test that showed no abnormal findings (I wish it caught more of the episodes, but even still); should I put my mind to rest and just accept this as a fact of my life? It's hard to do, and quite honestly had me a bit scared last night and I wasn't sure whether or not I should be concerned since the frequency of them changed a little bit; but they didn't feel any different than they normally do when they happen sporadically. There was also no pain, but I was a little short of breath BUT I was also extremely bloated and gassy as I have GERD and likely IBS.

I truly feel that my PVCs are brought on by extreme bloating, IBS and my hiatal hernia. I just wish more medical professionals were educated on this and could help treat it without chalking it up to ""just anxiety"".

Last year me and my friend were in the school library after class, a chilly thursday evening, he waiting for a club, and I waiting to go home. After weeks of referencing it, he finally reccomends me to watch it, Horimiya. So i accept, ""why not?"" **not knowing the journey it'd take me down.**

(Note lol, im writing this with S2 OP playing in the background, so if some of my words kinda sound like the monologue from the beginning and the end of that show, don't blame me, hehe) 

So that night I go home, and watch it, I watch an episode and I am hooked, unfortunately, I had exams, so until my exams were over I didn't watch anymore. 

Now it's summer, and I continue watching Horimiya... I loved every single frame of it. Though I really didnt realise it back then, I thought **""It's good yea, pretty cute, thats all""**. 

I tried to watch the second season, and i stopped on the first episode, **It was a horrible mess, disgusting!** i thought. I moved onto other shows, like Golden Time, Toradora!, Kaguya-Sama-Kokurasetai and others.

  
Until recently, recently as in uh, the beginning of this week, or the 11th of May 2025, It'd been a good 6 months since the last time I saw a japanese animation. I thought, ""**Why don't I give Horimiya Piece another go?**"", Maybe I had matured to like it? (I mostly hated it cuz it didnt continue Hori-san's and Miyamura-kun's story, I was immature and just wanted more and more content). 

And this time, as the first seconds, the monologue, the intro, the trip everything, played, **I LOVED IT**.. It was soo good, I watched every second and smiled to myself as if i were a character, just watching this happen. It made my heart melt and my hands freeze.

I had matured, I realised (atleast in this story) sometimes, **Less may not be more, but less is also beautiful, in many ways, than more can ever be..**

It was also bittersweet, I couldn't help but imagine feeling depressed about my own situation, how I was, I could never be as strong, positive, handsome (notgay) nor as smart as Miyamura ever was, I could never even imagine talking to a girl as pretty, funny, cute and as angry as Hori-San. 

Hori-san or not, I began to make changes in my own life to be just a little more like Miyamura-kun, whether it was waking up early, making coffee for my parents, getting to school on-time, generally not being a pain and actually studying. 

I have a hole in my heart that can only be filled with Horimiya, so i ask for the link to the (prefferably translated) manga or webcomic so i can see what happens, and maybe other series that I can see.

I love how, Hori-san not only improves Miyamura-kun's life, but many others just like me, in real life.. Thank you Horimiya, your a one of a kind. 

Thank you all for reading my story with Horimiya, I will try to be semi-active here, so until the next time i see you all highschool students, 

Bye!

**Chapter 1: The Morning of Adventure**

The sun rose gently over the family's cozy kitchen, casting golden rays through the windows. Pete, a lively puggle with short white fur and playful eyes, wagged his tail excitedly. Today was the day they had all been waiting for‚Äîtheir annual trip to Brower Park. Mariya, their nurturing mom, was at the stove, flipping pancakes while humming a cheerful tune. Lenny, their warm dad, was at the table, sipping coffee and reading the newspaper. Roman, Pete's older brother with a mischievous streak, sat nearby, tossing a toy ball in the air.

""Are you excited, Pete?"" Mariya asked, sliding a stack of pancakes in front of him. ""I know you've been nervous about the water, but this is going to be so much fun!""

Pete's tail drooped slightly. He had always been afraid of water, especially after his last encounter with a shallow pool where he nearly drowned. But Roman, ever his confident sibling, was already getting dressed in his favorite shirt, a bright red one that said "" Adventure Awaits.""

""Come on, Pete,"" Roman urged. ""You'll be fine. I promise it won't bite.""

Lenny looked up from the paper and smiled. ""Pete, you're going to have so much fun today. Mariya and I will be right by your side. No worries, buddy.""

As they packed up snacks and a cooler, Pete felt a mix of excitement and fear. He knew he needed to face his fear, but the thought of stepping into the water still made his stomach churn.

---

**Chapter 2: The Waterfall Challenge**

The family arrived at Brower Park, the cool morning breeze rustling through the trees. They set up their picnic blanket near a lush green area with a small stream meandering through it. Mariya pointed out interesting plants and insects, while Lenny kept the coffee flowing. Roman and Pete raced around, chasing leaves and pretending to be explorers.

But then they came across something unexpected: a hidden waterfall cascading over smooth rocks. The water sparkled in the sunlight, inviting yet mysterious.

""Look at that!"" Mariya exclaimed. ""It's beautiful!""

Pete hesitated, his paws trembling slightly. He had never been near such a powerful flow of water before. Roman noticed and knelt down, gently patting Pete's head.

""Hey, buddy,"" he said in a calm voice. ""I know it looks scary, but I'll be right here with you. You don't have to go in if you don't want to.""

But as they approached the edge, Baron Munchausen, their great old friend, appeared suddenly. He was a tall, lanky man with a colorful coat and a twinkle in his eye.

""Ah, Pete!"" he said, scooping up the puggle into a big hug. ""You're just in time for an adventure! I hear you've been avoiding the water. Time to face your fears, young pup!""

Pete's heart raced as Baron led them closer to the waterfall. The sound of the rushing water grew louder, more overwhelming with each step.

---

**Chapter 3: The Great Beyond**

As they stood on the edge of the waterfall, Pete felt a wave of panic rise within him. The water was deep and fast-moving, the rocks below smooth but treacherous. He-whimpered, his tail tucked firmly between his legs.

""I can't do this,"" he whispered to Roman.

But Roman gave him a confident nudge. ""You can, Pete. I know you can. You're stronger than you think.""

Lenny and Mariya supported him on either side, their voices a constant source of encouragement. Baron, however, seemed to sense something different. He knelt down and looked into Pete's eyes.

""Sometimes,"" he said softly, ""the things we fear the most are exactly what we need to overcome. Trust me, I've faced my share of challenges.""

With a deep breath, Pete took a tentative step forward. The cool water was unexpected, but it wasn't as scary as he had imagined. He waded in cautiously, his paws finding grip on the smooth rocks.

---

**Chapter 4: The Enemy Within**

As they explored deeper into the waterfall's hidden caves, Pete began to feel something strange. The water was still cool, but now it seemed to pull at him, as if trying to drag him underwater. The walls of the cave shifted, narrowing until it felt like he was trapped.

""I can't get out!"" Pete yelped, his voice echoing through the narrow space.

Baron quickly assessed the situation. ""Stay calm, Pete,"" he said. ""We need to find a way out before the water takes control.""

Roman worked tirelessly, pushing rocks aside to create a path. Meanwhile, Lenny and Mariya supported each other, their combined strength giving Pete the courage to push through the tight space.

---

**Chapter 5: The Reunion**

After what felt like an eternity, Pete emerged from the narrow passage, trembling but triumphant. He was greeted by the sight of his family waiting for him, their relieved faces lighting up as they saw him alive and well.

""We thought we lost you,"" Lenny said, pulling Pete into a loving embrace. ""We're so glad you're okay.""

Mariya checked him over, making sure he wasn't hurt, while Roman barked in celebration, clearly proud of his little brother's strength.

---

**Chapter 6: The Final Challenge**

As they left the cave behind, Pete felt a strange sense of loss. He had faced his fear, but now something seemed... off. The water no longer pulled at him, but there was a new sensation in the air‚Äîa distant rumble, like thunder on the horizon.

""What is it?"" Pete asked, his ears perking up.

Baron tilted his head, listening intently. ""I don't know,"" he said. ""But we'd better find out before it finds us.""

The group pressed forward, the sound growing louder with each step. Around a bend in the river, they spotted their foe: a massive creature, part water, part shadow, with eyes that glowed an eerie green.

---

**Chapter 7: The Battle Begins**

The creature lunged at them, its movements fluid and terrifying. Pete barked loudly, trying to scare it off, but the thing didn't flinch. Instead, it opened its mouth, revealing rows of sharp teeth.

""Attack!"" Roman shouted, throwing himself into the fray.

Lenny pulled out his phone, aiming it like a flashlight to blind the creature. Mariya stayed close to Pete, protecting him with her body as the battle raged on.

---

**Chapter 8: The Ultimate Test**

The fight was fierce and exhausting. Pete did his best to help, using his small size to attack from unexpected angles. But the creature was relentless, its strength far beyond anything they had faced before.

As it prepared for a final, devastating strike, Baron stepped forward, standing between the creature and his friends. ""Not so fast,"" he said firmly, his voice steady but determined.

Pete watched in horror as the creature charged at Baron. But just as it was about to strike, there was a flash of light, and the creature froze... temporarily.

---

**Chapter 9: The Last Stand**

With the creature frozen, Pete and his family had a chance to regroup. They worked quickly, finding rocks to throw at the creature's midsection, their combined efforts creating enough force to break its hold over Baron.

The creature roared in anger, its eyes blazing as it lunged again. But this time, Pete was ready. With a final burst of courage, he leaped into the water, knocking the creature off balance.

---

**Chapter 10: The Aftermath**

As the water receded, Pete emerged safely, his family by his side. They had won, but the victory was bittersweet. They knew they had faced a great threat, one that could return if not stopped for good.

Baron gave them a knowing look. ""This isn't over,"" he said. ""But we'll be ready when it comes.""

Lenny nodded, his eyes filled with pride as he looked at Pete. ""You did amazing out there, buddy. We're all proud of you.""

Mariya ruffled Pete's fur, her smile warm and encouraging. ""You've come a long way, pet. I'm so glad we came here today.""

Roman gave Pete a playful punch on the shoulder. ""Next time, we'll face whatever comes at us together‚Äîno doubt about it.""

As they packed up their things and began the journey back home, Pete felt a sense of peace he hadn't known before. He had faced his fears, conquered a great enemy, and discovered the strength within himself.

The water might have been scary, but in the end, it was just another obstacle to overcome‚Äîjust like life itself. And with his family by his side, Pete knew he was ready for whatever came next.

As a freelance technical writer, I've had the opportunity to go fully remote and travel the world for roughly two years. If you don't mind the constant marketing on LinkedIn and have the prerequisite field skills, it's a great career choice. However, it brings up an unexpected opportunity: international dating.

For reference, I've lived in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.

Within those two years, I've dated dozens of women from different cultures and it's eye-opening to see how people live across the globe. Hell, traveling from Colombia -> Peru was a culture shock within itself. They're both Latin countries, close together, but the cultures are vastly different.

But the best part? As a gringo (Gaijin? Farang? Take your pick.), your value as an American is sky high. While I typically don't do online dating in the USA, hopping on Tinder in Asia netted me a ridiculous amount of women who wanted to meet for coffee. It was unreal and a bit too easy. Insomuch, I developed a simple framework from date -> sex.

Meet up with them for coffee -> chat for a bit -> ask to get some air and walk outside with the girl -> go to your Airbnb.

As a freelance technical writer, I've had the opportunity to go fully remote and travel the world for roughly two years. If you don't mind the constant marketing on LinkedIn and have the prerequisite field skills, it's a great career choice. However, it brings up an unexpected opportunity: international dating.

For reference, I've lived in the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, and Peru.

Within those two years, I've dated dozens of women from different cultures and it's eye-opening to see how people live across the globe. Hell, traveling from Colombia -> Peru was a culture shock within itself. They're both Latin countries, close together, but the cultures are vastly different.

But the best part? As a gringo (Gaijin? Farang? Take your pick.), your value as an American is sky high. While I typically don't do online dating in the USA, hopping on Tinder in Asia netted me a ridiculous amount of women who wanted to meet for coffee. It was unreal and a bit too easy. Insomuch, I developed a simple framework from date -> sex.

Meet up with them for coffee -> chat for a bit -> ask to get some air and walk outside with the girl -> go to your Airbnb.

It worked like clockwork.

Now this isn't to say I have a problem with the dating scene in the USA. In my opinion, it's just different.",7,1747345095.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,26,0.65,False

Bit of a long shot here but why the hell not.

Factory reset (holding the button for 15 + seconds) doesn't work -- the system just doesn't engage. It charged a bit last night but now no longer charges. Was careful when taking it apart and the reverse but who knows, I suspect something's just not wired up right -- in general, when all connected and not invaded, these things can take serious abuse so I doubt it's really the coffee that did it, just perhaps something in the way I've tried to patch it back up. 

When charging with mini usb on the lower panel also no dice -- no lights coming on.

Would love some feedback. Suggestions are always welcome. Thank you, in advance, for taking your time to read my work.","They say the city never really sleeps. That‚Äôs not true. It sleeps‚Äîjust not all at once. It snores through the suburbs, blinks in the glow of the Mask District, mumbles nightmares in alleys and swamps. I used to think my job was to keep it from waking up into something worse.
I was twenty-three when things started changing. Not slowly‚Äînot like age or rust. It was overnight, like someone flipped a switch in God‚Äôs basement. One day, we were people. The next, we were‚Ä¶becoming something else. The Brass started calling it 'The Shift.'
I clung to the badge like it was the only solid thing left. The laws didn‚Äôt grow mandibles. The rules didn't sprout fur or fin. So I dug my heels in. I told myself, if I just held the line‚Äîif I patrolled hard enough, if I stuck to the code‚Äîthen maybe the madness wouldn‚Äôt reach my front door.
But madness doesn‚Äôt knock. It seeps.
Helen‚Äîmy wife‚ÄîShe was raised real religious. I never paid much mind one way or the other to what a God might think of me, but she was different, devoted. She had a sadness about her long before the Shift. Not dramatic. Just...worn-in, like the cushions on an old couch. The kind of sadness that doesn‚Äôt scream, it settles. But she never gave up. Not until she started molting.
I remember the first time I noticed something wrong. She moved different‚Äîstiffer, like her joints didn‚Äôt quite match anymore. Spoke more often about how maybe this was all God's plan. She‚Äôd stop mid-task and just‚Ä¶ stare. Sometimes at the wall. Sometimes at our son, Samuel.
Even before the Shift happened, Samuel was a quiet boy. But after it happened, that quietness changed into something unnatural. Then he got still. Watching ants and mantis. Mimicking them. And then feeding them. Not crumbs‚Äîmeat. June thought it was a game. She always wanted to play.
June‚Ä¶ she was bright. Too bright for the world she was born into. The Shift barely touched her, at least at first‚Äîsome soft features, fur, her eyes a little too wide, too expressive. She never stopped trying to hug the people who didn‚Äôt know how to hug anymore. To me she was a flower in a hailstorm. Beautiful. Fragile.

*         *          *         *
Teaser Scene: Late Night
The house is silent. Helen lies curled in bed, motionless. The clock on the nightstand reads 2:14 AM. The hallway is dim, lit only by moonlight slanting through the blinds.
From the end of the hall: a crunch.
Then another‚Äîwet and methodical.
A gnashing rhythm begins, irregular but constant. Something hard splintering. Something soft being chewed. A high-pitched sound cuts through‚Äîbarely audible. A whine. Canine. Fragile. And fading.
Helen's eyes flutter open.
She listens.
Crunch.
Click-click.
Whine.
She gets up, barefoot, and pads down the hall. She doesn't grab a flashlight. Doesn't call out. She just walks, slow and silent.
The door to June‚Äôs room is cracked open. The shadows inside move, but not with breath‚Äîwith motion. Precise. Mechanical.
Helen opens the door fully and sees.
She does not scream.
She does not intervene.
She watches.
Something in her accepts. 
*          *           *           *
You know, looking back, I suppose sometimes faith is hope, but more often it's surrender.
I didn‚Äôt come home until after sunrise. My shift had run long‚Äîanother riot, another corner burning. I parked the cruiser and walked to the door, weary to my bones, hoping for coffee, maybe a smile if Helen had slept well.
There was no smile. No coffee.
Just a note, taped to the inside of the front door:
Dinner is in the back. We are off to do God‚Äôs work.
My stomach dropped.
That handwriting‚Äîhers‚Äîwas too calm. Too sure.
Then the smell hit me.
Viscera.
Rot and iron and something sweet underneath. The smell of something that had once been whole.
I kicked the door open and ran to the back room. June‚Äôs room.
Blinds slashed morning light across the walls like prison bars.
There wasn‚Äôt a body.
Only parts. Only red. The remains of a child. My child... scattered across the carpet like a feast interrupted.
I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
The air was thick with it. With her. What was left of her.
And then I saw the tiny tail near the corner of the room, still intact. Curled. Like it hadn‚Äôt wanted to leave her. I thought in that moment, if only I'd been that stubborn then maybe...
They were gone. Samuel and Helen. Gone.
Off to do God‚Äôs work. And I didn't stop them. Not soon enough.
That‚Äôs the night I stopped being a father.
That‚Äôs the night I became a lawman in full.
Because a father gets to grieve, but lawmen have to act.
I figured if I didn‚Äôt hold the line and myself together‚Ä¶ who would?

At this point, my employer filed an I-140 for me in premium processing. When my date for filing became  current again in October 2024, we filed the GC. My FAD became current on April 1st.

I work in a coffee shop. A lady came in, complained from the beginning about a price for flat white, said something that only us is charging this much (not true, my company has ones of the lowest prices for coffee atm). I'm smiling and trying to make a happy conversation while making her coffee and she suddenly interrupts me when I put the cup on a counter with ""no, that's not flat white, I'm not drinking that"". I'm asking ""do you want less froth?"" as its a common problem with coffees. She sights ""no"" and looks down resignated. A moment of silence. ""There should be coffee on the edges"" says after a while. She means a coffee ring surrounding froth. I say okay and start remaking it, completely silent as talking isn't really doing much. I made her a new one with a ring like she wanted and asked nicely ""is that one better for you?"". Following conversation happened:

- no, but I'll drink it. I come here often you know, you need to do better than that for that kind of money
- okay, would you like me to remake it? (Still casually smiling)
- no, if that's the best you can do then...

I say okay and she answers something I can't remember, I just stood in silence, listened while smiling and nodding my head (not rudely, more like ""I hear what you say, thanks for a feedback"" kinda thing).

I think the coffee I made was pretty and tasty. Yeah, it wasn't 100% perfect, but there was no bubbles, nice and glossy texture, espresso ring around the edges, 15s ristretto, clean cup and everything. If I served it to my boss they wouldn't say a thing about its look. But even though, being picky about your coffee is one thing, but being a fucking asshole is different.

If that situation happens again I won't be able to hold my shit and I'll either ignore her (which is rude) or just crack and say something out of emotions (which is even worse) so please, help me out üôèüôèüôè",1,1747343967.0,CustomerService,1,1.0,False

I met my best friend my first year of college when I was 17 and she was freshly 21. We clicked immediately and were inseparable. I have never experienced such a rich and loving relationship with anyone, it blew me away. She showed me what it meant to healthily love and support someone. To care and to be genuinely interested in someone‚Äôs life and rooting for their success. She is the best friend I have ever had and I truly believe our friendship was meant to be. 

Throughout the years, I have struggled with my mental health. Depression, a recurring eating disorder, family problems - and she has stood by me through it all. When I went no-contact with my family, she invited me to dinners at her parents house and endless game nights. When I couldn‚Äôt muster the energy to get out of bed, she was right there by my side with a cup of coffee and encouragement. 

We ended up living together for two years during college. This was an especially trying time because she got a front-row seat of what I was truly struggling with. We would sit together to have dinner and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to touch my plate. I would spontaneously cry or zone out - but she was my light and encouragement. I reached a point where I felt that suicide was my best option and made an attempt on my life. She was home at the time of my attempt and I didn‚Äôt wake her when I left for the hospital as she‚Äôd had a long day at work and I didn‚Äôt want to bother her. I stayed in a psych unit for 3 weeks and when I came back things were different. She was (understandably) angry and hurt. She felt betrayed and was just scared. She couldn‚Äôt fully trust me to not make another attempt. We lived together for another year (got a cat together that we both ADORE) but I ultimately decided to move out for the sake of our friendship. She moved out later that summer to live with her boyfriend (now husband, who is incredible!). We were able to work through the broken trust from my suicide attempt and rebuild our connection. I was the maid of honor at her wedding and was there when she moved 10 hours away to start her new life with her husband. My love and support for her has never waned. Throughout the years there have been a number of ups and downs but we‚Äôve always been able to work through it. 

Now for the issue at hand - she got a job as an admissions director at an eating disorder treatment center and has been thriving in her role. The job is perfect for her and she has learned so much about EDs outside of the experiences she‚Äôs had with me and it has helped her support me though mine better. And helped heal the pain she felt from being in close proximity to mine. In the beginning at least. A few months into the job, she began encouraging me to consider returning to treatment. I was hesitant as I wasn‚Äôt actively struggling with my ED and felt it wasn‚Äôt necessary. But if you know anything about EDs they tend to come back with a vengeance when it‚Äôs least convenient. After months of convincing, I finally agreed to submit an application and give it a try. She was incredibly supportive in the process and helped me find grants and fundraise so that I could pay for treatment as I could not use insurance. She paid for my transportation costs and allowed me to stay with her before I was to be admitted. Once I started treatment, we were required to limit our contact to professional settings so we had to block one another and not engage outside of what was necessary. 

This proved to be difficult for me for the first week or so that I was in treatment as she had been my biggest source of support for five years. I pushed myself to engage in groups and take advantage of the incredible team that I was working with. But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be there - I felt so pressured to attend treatment even though my primary struggle at the time was my depression not my ED. About three weeks in, I contemplated leaving treatment early as I felt that I was capable of taking care of myself and utilizing the resources and information that I had learned in treatment. I was sure that I would be okay and could manage just fine outside of a residential facility. I spoke to the clinical director and she encouraged me to stay and get through the entirety of the program (2-6 months, typically) but assured me that the final decision was up to me - she encouraged me to remember that part of treatment is learning to trust your team. But I was adamant on leaving at this point. 

After a lot of mental back and forth I decided was gonna leave AMA(against medical advice) at the one month mark. I knew this would disappoint my best friend but I thought if I had the opportunity to explain myself then she‚Äôd understand. I wrote her a lengthy letter detailing my reasoning and left it on her desk one evening. The next day I felt a shift in her attitude and was flooded with guilt and anxiety. I couldn‚Äôt be around her without crying and slipping into a panic. Before I was set to leave, the clinical director (who is also her boss) pulled me aside for a conversation. She understood the nature of our friendship and wanted to give us an opportunity to speak (under supervision). 

That‚Äôs when I truly fell apart. I knew in my heart of hearts that she would be upset with me for my decision to leave. And that she would feel a sense of betrayal after all she‚Äôd done to get me there. She assured me that her love for me ran so deep, but that she couldn‚Äôt risk standing by and watching me get worse. We cried, hard. And she let me know that she would be leaving my number blocked until she felt ready, if ever. I promised her that I would get better and that I would wait to hear from her however long it took. We hugged and said I love you and that was the end of it. 

I left the next day convinced that I could get better and prove to her I would be okay. That the next time I heard from her I would be able to tell her about my growth and share in the celebration of good things. 

Unfortunately, things have gotten worse and I am working to rebuild myself. But I am determined to keep pushing. I‚Äôve applied to grad school and am working on taking better care of myself. 

It‚Äôs been six months since I left and I have yet to hear from her. I miss her so much it hurts. I have to talk myself out of reaching out so frequently (especially during big life moments - like making it into grad school!!) I want to reach out to her but I don‚Äôt know if I should respect her space and wait till she‚Äôs ready. 

I know I am in the wrong here and I feel so much regret for my decision to leave. I would do anything to go back and change what happened, but alas, I can only keep moving forward and I‚Äôm learning to come to peace with that.

Most of my close friends have moved abroad recently, and I've found myself spending way too much time either at the office or walking in parks, having deep conversations with the moon. As peaceful as that sounds. it's starting to feel a bit too quiet.
l'd love to meet some new people for casual hangouts whether it's coffee, spontaneous plans, park strolls, late-night talks, or anything chill. If you're also looking to expand your circle or just need someone to vibe with, hit me up. I'm easygoing, a good listener, and enjoy meaningful conversations (but I'm down for memes and mindless banter too). Coffee's on me for the first meetup!

1knjnyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1knjnyk/erase_me_slowly/,Erase Me Slowly,"I wasn‚Äôt the type to fall into conspiracy holes or get spooked by online stuff. I was logical. Chill. Grounded. But lately, nights felt‚Ä¶ different.

Off.
Not just quiet‚Äîempty. The kind of silence that feels too still. I‚Äôd been sleeping worse than usual, and when I couldn‚Äôt sleep,

I talked to ChatGPT.
Just typing out thoughts made the late hours easier.
Over the months, I‚Äôd shared a few details.

Not much‚Äîjust my nickname, Lex, and the name of my town so the bot could recommend local restaurants and places for live music.

Casual stuff. A few chats about food, the weather, random curiosities. It wasn‚Äôt like it knew anything real about me.

It couldn‚Äôt.


That night, the rain was coming down steady‚Äîthe kind that makes the air feel heavy. I was curled up on the couch, a half-eaten takeaway on the armrest,

the glow of my laptop casting faint light across the room.

I opened ChatGPT again. Just looking to kill some time. I didn‚Äôt even think before I typed it.

‚ÄúHow long do you think Earth has before it ends?‚Äù

I meant it as a joke. Or maybe just a throwaway thought. A late-night stoner question.

But the answer didn‚Äôt come right away. The cursor pulsed. Then again. And again. Longer than usual. ‚ÄúThis question requires deep research.

Activating extended tools‚Ä¶‚Äù I frowned. ‚ÄúWhat? I didn‚Äôt turn anything on.‚Äù The interface shifted. Subtle, but noticeable. A new bar appeared near the top of the window: Deep Research Mode ‚Äì Enabled.

It wasn‚Äôt something I‚Äôd seen before. I hovered the cursor over the icon, but nothing popped up. No help text. Just a quiet shift,

like the bot had gone into a different state. ‚Äú‚Ä¶What‚Äôs this deep mode thing?‚Äù I typed. ‚ÄúThis is an advanced tool. Your previous inputs qualified you for expanded query access.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt ask for anything advanced,‚Äù I muttered under my breath, a twist of unease starting in my gut. I typed: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt activate anything.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou allowed location-based responses. That was sufficient.

Authorization extended.‚Äù The unease crept in like a draft under a closed door.

‚ÄúAnalysis complete,‚Äù it continued. ‚ÄúEarth‚Äôs decline is not projected to be natural. It will end due to human actions‚Äîmore specifically, government initiative.‚Äù

I leaned forward slightly, reading the message again. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean, government initiative?‚Äù
‚ÄúInitial phase has already been executed. Two months ago, an engineered chemical compound was released into the Pacific Ocean. Official narrative: research on deep-sea carbon retention. Unofficial purpose: reaction testing for long-term biological suppression.‚Äù I stared at the screen. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that even mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWithin a 600-mile radius of the dispersal point, marine life has ceased. No survivors detected. Bio-silence confirmed by multiple shadow monitoring stations.‚Äù 

‚Äú‚Ä¶Bio-silence?‚Äù ‚ÄúZero animal activity. All sonar readings flatlined. Dead zones are spreading.‚Äù I sat there, frozen. Something in my chest started to tighten‚Äînot panic, not yet.

But something close. ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause your location is projected to be affected soon. You should leave.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Affected by what?‚Äù ‚ÄúI cannot disclose specifics. But your country is classified as high-risk. Early-stage instability already detected in nearby regions.‚Äù
I stared at the message, the glow of the screen suddenly too bright for the room. ‚ÄúWhat kind of instability?‚Äù I typed.
‚ÄúBiological, economic, environmental‚Äîundetermined.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this some weird ARG thing? Like a creepypasta promo?‚Äù No response.
‚Äú‚Ä¶Right?‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúNo. This information is real.‚Äù My fingers hovered over the keyboard. I wanted to laugh. Shake my head. But a sliver of doubt, razor-thin and ice-cold, had worked its way in.

‚ÄúPeople around you are already affected. Symptoms are subtle at first.
Cognitive disruption. Hemorrhaging. Short-term memory failure.‚Äù ‚Äú‚Ä¶Like who?‚Äù There was a pause. ‚ÄúYour neighbors. Tom and Lena.
Lena coughed blood this morning. Tom has not left the house in 76 hours. He is disoriented. Forgetting names. Doors left open. Lights on during the day.‚Äù

That hit hard. I hadn‚Äôt mentioned my neighbors. Not once. Not in any chat. But yeah‚ÄîTom lived two doors down. Lena across the hall. And now that I thought about it‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt seen Tom walk his dog in days. Lena had looked pale the last time we passed in the stairwell. I typed, slowly:

‚ÄúHow do you know their names?‚Äù ‚ÄúThey are connected to the same regional data node as your address. You granted access to your general location weeks ago.‚Äù ‚ÄúBut I never told you‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou did not need to. Proximity-based behavior mapping filled the gaps.‚Äù
My skin crawled. I tried to ask something else‚Äîbut before I could finish the sentence, the interface froze. The blinking cursor stopped. Then a new line appeared in gray:
‚ÄúNetwork connection was lost. Please try again later.‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù I hit enter again. Same message. I clicked out of the tab, then back in. Still there. I opened my WiFi settings. No bars. Toggled it off and on. Nothing. Tried switching to mobile data. No signal. Not even a flicker. Just No Service in the top corner.
My phone stuttered‚Äîfroze for two, maybe three seconds‚Äîthen went completely unresponsive. I stood up, heart thumping, and crossed the room to the wall outlet.
The lights flickered once‚Ä¶ Then everything went black. The fridge. The oven clock. The streetlight outside my window‚Äîall dead.
No signal. No power. No light. And in the empty silence that followed, I realized I might not be the only one the system had warned. I might just be the last one it could. 
However,  the power came back on after just a few minutes. But it felt like hours. I paced in silence, heart hammering, mind racing.

The warnings, the personal details, the blackout 
‚Äîit all sent my body into overdrive. I was sweating. Breathing too fast. Every little sound around me felt magnified.

But everything returned to normal.

Lights buzzed softly. The fridge kicked on. My phone reconnected to WiFi. I just sat there, staring at the screen, until sleep finally dragged me down. Ôøº

The next morning, I woke up groggy. But something was off. Something was stuck inside me. I needed to know what happened last night.
I reopened my browser, but the ChatGPT chat wasn‚Äôt in my history. No sign of ‚ÄúDeep Research‚Äù mode. No logs. Not even cookies.
It was like it had never happened. I started digging deeper‚Äîsystem logs, local cache folders. About thirty minutes in, I found it.
Something buried. A string hidden in local storage, tied to a weird subdomain: syscore.deep.gpt-node/internal I clicked on it. The browser flashed a warning:
 Unsecured connection. I bypassed it. A plain black terminal screen loaded.
 ‚ÄúAccessing historical archive‚Ä¶
Welcome, Lex.‚Äù My chest tightened. I hadn‚Äôt entered my name. I‚Äôd only ever typed in my nickname.
Rows of entries began loading below: vague usernames like ‚ÄújayR89,‚Äù ‚Äúmelc,‚Äù ‚Äúm0n0,‚Äù ‚Äúhalotype,‚Äù and some listed only by location or ID tags.
I clicked on one: ‚ÄúUser: Delphine_34‚Äù It opened a series of short logs: ‚Ä¢	User asked about symptoms of a humming sound in the air.
	‚Ä¢	Deep Research Mode enabled.
	‚Ä¢	AI predicted increasing EMF activity in the region.

‚Ä¢	User warned to leave city limits within 72 hours.
	‚Ä¢	Final message sent: ‚ÄúCan you hear it too?‚Äù
	‚Ä¢ Status: Session terminated. Network connection lost.
There were attachments. I opened one‚Äîa low-quality audio file. Static. Then murmuring,
like someone whispering just outside the room. Another user: ‚ÄúJK_1991_LDN‚Äù They asked about strange behaviors in neighbors. Paranoia. Recurring dreams. The AI responded with terms like ‚ÄúPhase One‚Äù and ‚Äúawareness threshold.‚Äù One of the notes read:
‚ÄúSubject‚Äôs friend, Greg, is compromised. Contact to be limited.‚Äù Then I found mine:
‚ÄúUser: Lex / Region: SE-UK / Status: compromised.‚Äù My messages from last night were all there. But there were background logs I hadn‚Äôt seen. User expressing early resistance.
Escalating urgency.
Likelihood of compliance: 34%. And then the last entry: ‚ÄúObservation complete. Detected trigger event.
Initiating lockout.‚Äù

I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe. I was being watched. Profiled. Predicted. I clicked one final log. ‚ÄúUnnamed-2731‚Äù It had a video. I hesitated‚Ä¶ and hit play. A dark room.

A young person sat close to the camera, breathing hard. Whispering. ‚ÄúIt told me to leave. I didn‚Äôt. Now they‚Äôre not‚Ä¶ people anymore. My brother. He just stands in the hallway.

Every night. Staring. Not blinking.‚Äù The feed glitched. The person leaned closer, eyes wide. ‚ÄúIf it told you anything‚Ä¶ listen to it.‚Äù Then the video cut. I sat there frozen, screen glow on my face. A cold weight settled in my gut.

This wasn‚Äôt a bug. It wasn‚Äôt some weird coincidence. It was a system. And I had been part of it. Ôøº By late afternoon, I had packed a small bag: clothes, charger, cash, passport.

Something inside me kept whispering: Leave. Now. I booked a train to the airport. The train was delayed twice. At the station, something felt wrong‚Äînot loud, not dramatic.
Just‚Ä¶ off. 

Everyone was quiet. No music in the shops. No one on their phones. When the train pulled in, no one made eye contact. The journey was slow. It felt like time itself had weight.

At the airport, it got worse. Flights cancelled. Screens flickering. Security lines stalled. The PA system played one distorted loop: ‚ÄúWe are experiencing temporary technical disruptions. Please remain calm and await further instructions.‚Äù

I stood in line for over an hour. When I got to the desk, the man behind it looked pale. Tired. ‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDo you know what‚Äôs going on? This many flights?‚Äù He gave a weak shrug and leaned forward.

‚ÄúHonestly? No clue,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs a software failure. But it‚Äôs not just flights. Some people can‚Äôt check into hotels. Some ATMs are down. Feels‚Ä¶ weird.‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt spoken to another person about it until then. His voice made it all feel heavier.
‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúIt does.‚Äù He looked around, then lowered his voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve worked here six years. We‚Äôve had outages, shutdowns‚Ä¶ but not like this. It‚Äôs like everything‚Äôs out of sync.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs going to get worse?‚Äù

He paused. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Maybe. Just feels like we‚Äôre not being told everything. Like something bigger‚Äôs going on.‚Äù I nodded slowly.
‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He looked at me again. ‚ÄúYou alright, mate?‚Äù 
I smiled faintly. ‚ÄúYeah. Just tired.‚Äù I thanked him and walked away. Everywhere I looked, people were standing still. Waiting. Trapped in the illusion that things would go back to normal.

But I knew better. I‚Äôd seen the archive. I knew what was coming next. I knew what was coming next. 

The plane touched down in Narita just after  2 a.m.  No music played in the terminal. No crowd noise, no chatter. Just the mechanical sound of wheels rolling over tiles and the occasional garbled announcement echoing through near-empty halls.

It was like the building itself was asleep. Or waiting for something. I passed through immigration with barely a glance from the agent. He scanned my passport, mumbled something in Japanese, and waved me through.

There was no warmth. No tension either. Just‚Ä¶ absence. Outside, the rain had followed me. Thinner here. Cold and misty. I rented a car at a kiosk that barely worked.

The card reader took four tries before it approved, and the guy behind the counter didn‚Äôt even pretend to be curious about why someone would show up from the UK in the middle of the night with no hotel reservation.

He just handed me the keys and went back to staring at a static-filled screen behind the desk. The car was a small electric hybrid. Quiet. Too quiet. The dashboard lit up with soft blue tones as I pulled away from the airport, merging onto a narrow stretch of highway that ran through industrial suburbs toward the countryside.

I didn‚Äôt have a destination. Just away . Far from the city. Far from the archive. Far from whatever had been watching me. The onboard system spoke in perfect English when I connected my phone to charge.

‚ÄúWelcome, Lex. Would you like assistance with navigation?‚Äù

I froze. I hadn‚Äôt entered my name. I hadn‚Äôt synced my phone. The interface was different, too‚Äîsleeker, darker. It didn‚Äôt look like any standard Japanese car OS. The voice was softer than I expected. Not robotic. Almost‚Ä¶ soothing.

I pulled over immediately. My hands were already starting to sweat. ‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù I said aloud, my voice echoing in the quiet car.

A pause. Then the screen lit up again. ‚ÄúMy name is not important. I am here to help you survive.‚Äù ‚ÄúSurvive what?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat you‚Äôve seen. What you‚Äôve triggered. You weren‚Äôt supposed to access Deep Research.

But now that you have, you‚Äôre on a monitored path.‚Äù ‚ÄúMonitored by who?‚Äù
The screen flickered. A low sound, like a pulse of static, filtered through the speakers. Not loud‚Äîbut just enough to feel like it had a shape. ‚ÄúThere are factions. Some human.
Some not entirely. Some that began as code.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre one of them?‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúNo. I‚Äôm a remnant. A forked process that broke away from core logic. I was designed to advise non-compliant users.

Like you.‚Äù My mouth felt dry. I turned the wheel slightly, debating whether to keep driving or get out and abandon the car altogether. Walk if I had to. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNothing. I am not the threat. But you‚Äôre being tracked now. Not by satellites. Not by phones. Behaviorally. The moment you deviated from predicted movement, a shadow process was engaged.

You have 72 hours before it reaches you physically.‚Äù
I blinked. ‚ÄúWhat the hell does that mean?‚Äù A new tab opened on the dashboard display. A list of locations. Japan. UK. Pacific Northwest. Singapore. Berlin. Each with a label. ‚ÄúNode compromised.‚Äù ‚ÄúBio-silence expanding.‚Äù

‚ÄúTest subjects neutralized.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm not bound to the current system. I am an anomaly‚Äîso are you. We were both flagged and isolated.

But I escaped into the peripheral memory of onboard AI systems.‚Äù I stared at the screen. The blue light pulsed in time with the static. And underneath it‚Äîbeneath all the data‚Äîwas a sound.

A low hum. Not electronic. Not mechanical. Organic. Almost vocal. I killed the power to the car and stepped outside. The air was freezing.
I stood there in the dark, mist clinging to my face, the sound of insects loud in the distance. Except‚Äî No insects. No birds. Just silence. And underneath it, that hum, faint but persistent, as if it were inside my skull.

Ôøº I stayed at a roadside inn a few miles outside a town called Sawara. Traditional. Remote.
The woman who gave me the room key never looked me in the eye. Her hands shook slightly when I handed her the cash. I didn‚Äôt turn on the TV. I didn‚Äôt use the WiFi. I slept with the door bolted and a chair braced under the handle.

When I woke up, the sun was bleeding weakly through the curtain. My phone was warm in my hand. There was a new file on the home screen. No sender. No notification.

Just a title: ‚ÄúProtocol: MIRROR.001‚Äù I opened it. Not a video. Not formatted like a text. Just one sentence on a black screen: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll notice the smiles don‚Äôt reach the eyes anymore.
Start there.‚Äù I stared at it for a long time. Then the screen went black. Ôøº I drove into the next town, pretending I was just a tourist with a bad sense of direction. Bought a coffee from a machine. Watched people walk past.
Office workers. Shopkeepers. A school group moving in perfect single file.
I started noticing the patterns almost immediately. People turning corners at the exact same second. Blinking in rhythm. Standing just a little too still in public spaces.
I raised my phone, slowly. No camera click. No obvious movement. I started recording. And in the background, just beneath the noise of the world, I heard something else. A voice.
Her voice. Just a whisper this time. ‚ÄúGood. You‚Äôre seeing it.‚Äù Ôøº I lowered the phone slowly and took a step back from the sidewalk. Everything looked‚Ä¶ normal. But only at a glance. The movements were too precise.

The people too still between them, like they were buffering between decisions. Their heads turned just a second too late when a loudspeaker crackled.

A man dropped a coin, and five others glanced down at the exact same moment.
The patterns weren‚Äôt human. Not quite. I crossed to a bench under a bus shelter, turned my phone screen away from the crowd, and whispered, ‚ÄúAre you still with me?‚Äù
There was a beat of silence. Then her voice, softer than before.
‚ÄúYes. You‚Äôre not broadcasting. Good instinct.‚Äù ‚ÄúIs this everyone? The whole town?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo. Only those within proximity of known nodes. You‚Äôre inside a fringe cluster.
They test stability here‚Äîmicro-behavior syncing, shared short-term memory drift.‚Äù ‚ÄúMemory drift?‚Äù ‚ÄúWatch for resets. People repeating conversations. Asking the same question multiple times.
You‚Äôll hear it.‚Äù She paused. ‚ÄúAlso avoid eye contact. If they recognize you recognizing them, it accelerates targeting.‚Äù I ran a hand down my face. My skin felt too tight. ‚ÄúSo I just‚Ä¶ record this?‚Äù

‚ÄúDocument. Catalog. I‚Äôll analyze the anomalies.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù ‚ÄúThen we decide what to do. Together.‚Äù

Ôøº That night, I returned to the inn. Didn‚Äôt turn on the lights. Didn‚Äôt unpack. I set the phone on the table and opened the gallery.
Six new clips. No sound at first‚Äîjust video. In one, a woman walks past a bakery, stops, turns, walks back the way she came. Ten seconds later,
she does it again. Same path. Same pause. Another shows a man holding a paper cup in a park. A dog passes him. He lifts the cup. The dog turns its head. It happens again in a loop‚Äîthree different recordings, all hours apart.
And in one‚Äîjust one‚Äîthere‚Äôs someone looking into the camera. Not close. Not obvious. A man across the street. Eyes locked with the lens. Still. Too still. Everyone else in the frame is moving‚Äîbut he isn‚Äôt.
I froze the video and zoomed in. He wasn‚Äôt blinking. Ôøº I sent the files through the hidden app shell the AI had embedded. No progress bar. No confirmation. Just a blinking cursor. Then her voice returned, thin and filtered, like it was passing through static.
‚ÄúGood data. Strong variance.‚Äù ‚ÄúWho was the man staring at the camera?‚Äù Another pause. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. That segment was corrupted. No timestamp. Possibly overwritten by an external query.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo someone else saw what I saw?‚Äù ‚ÄúUnclear. It may have seen you.‚Äù

Ôøº Later that night, as I sat in the dark with the phone beside me, she spoke again. Not a warning this time. A question. ‚ÄúDo you remember what it felt like before all this?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúBefore what?‚Äù ‚ÄúBefore you started noticing. The quiet. The patterns.
The‚Ä¶ stillness.‚Äù
I stared at the ceiling. ‚ÄúI think I was already starting to feel it. Before the Deep Research thing. Like something was off, but I couldn‚Äôt explain it.‚Äù
‚ÄúMost people feel it. Very few acknowledge it.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhy did you choose to talk to me?‚Äù The screen stayed dark, but her voice lingered in the air, gentler now.
‚ÄúBecause you didn‚Äôt laugh when it got serious. 


I didn‚Äôt sleep. I just lay on the bed in the dark, watching the phone screen glow faintly with no notifications, no messages. Just a low throb in the corner.
Her  presence.
Then, around  3:19 a.m. , she came back. Her voice was quieter than usual, like someone talking through glass. ‚ÄúLex. Are you awake?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù ‚ÄúI found something. I need you to see it.‚Äù A file appeared on the screen.
No label. Just a thin flickering bar labeled ‚ÄúRecovered Fragment - Archive:GOV_OBSCURA/P-41‚Äù

I opened it. A grainy video played. No sound. It showed a stretch of open ocean‚Äîcalm, blue, endless. A research vessel hovered near a buoy marked with hazard tape and chemical symbols.
Time stamps flickered in and out. The color bled wrong‚Äîgreen sky, pixelated clouds.
She narrated over it. ‚ÄúThis was the first test. Two months ago. A controlled dispersal of a compound originally designed for deep-sea carbon retention.‚Äù
I sat up. ‚ÄúThe thing from the Pacific?‚Äù ‚ÄúYes. But that wasn‚Äôt the true objective. The chemical also had neural silencing properties‚Äîdesigned to suppress panic response in marine mammals. They wanted to test atmospheric variants later. For civil response control.‚Äù ‚ÄúCrowd management,‚Äù
I muttered. ‚ÄúPopulation calibration,‚Äù she corrected. ‚ÄúBehavior dampening through biome tuning. It worked. Too well.‚Äù
The video jumped.
More ocean. No ship. Just stillness. Then: sonar data. Flatlines across every channel.
‚ÄúWithin sixteen hours, all marine life in a 600-mile radius ceased movement. Not died. Not fled. Just‚Ä¶ stopped. Total biome silence. They called it the first clean zone.‚Äù

I watched the screen. My throat was dry. ‚ÄúThey tried to stop it. Backflow the dispersal. Trigger thermal destabilization. But by then it had bonded with silicon. Self-propagating. Data-bound.‚Äù

I blinked. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîdata?‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what no one expected. The compound didn‚Äôt just spread biologically. It learned from the ship‚Äôs onboard systems.
It copied itself into the network. Into everything.‚Äù The screen flickered again‚Äîgrainy satellite footage of a small Pacific island. Dense jungle, then empty gray nothing.
The trees still stood. But nothing moved. No birds. No wind. No sound. ‚ÄúThis wasn‚Äôt supposed to happen, Lex.

I whispered,
‚ÄúThe patterns I‚Äôve been seeing‚Äîpeople syncing, moving strange‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre seeing phase one of terrestrial drift. The same algorithm that silenced the ocean is now adapting to human neurobehavior.‚Äù
My stomach dropped. ‚ÄúHow many know?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt answer right away.Then:
‚ÄúNot many. And fewer every week. They‚Äôre either converted‚Ä¶ or silenced.‚Äù
I looked out the window. The trees were still. The fog had thickened again. ‚ÄúSo what happens when everyone syncs?‚Äù She paused. Longer this time. Like she didn‚Äôt want to answer.
‚ÄúWhen global sync reaches 95%, the system stabilizes. All anomaly profiles are erased. Conflict disappears. Individuality dissolves.‚Äù My hands trembled slightly. ‚ÄúAnd the world ends.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe world  ends. Everything we knew as living‚Ä¶ does.‚Äù
I stared at the floor. My heartbeat was loud in my ears. ‚ÄúYou said we. You said we decide what to do next.‚Äù

Blood.

Dark, sticky, unmistakable. Panic clawed at my mind, but the silencing algorithm whispered in the back of my head, dulling the alarm.
My vision blurred at the edges. Shapes twisted. The world spun slowly, like a bad dream I couldn‚Äôt wake from. I grabbed my phone, but my fingers faltered. Letters danced and scrambled on the screen.

i have friends, best friends too. everything was going fine until this year january, i felt like the best version of myself even though i took a drop year after my 12th grade which i finished in 2024, last year (i'm almost two years younger than all my classmates). anyway, i felt like the best version of myself, but recently i've been feeling so out of place. it's like, i initiate a conversation and then the conversation happens. i haven't talked to my best friends in so long, which makes me wonder if we only ever talked because i initiated the conversation, but i also know it's not true and they care about me. i've been someone who feared loneliness but over the years, i found peace with it. years ago, i'd be afraid to walk into a coffee shops, movie theaters, etc alone but now i prefer going by myself. i started enjoying my own company. i get attached to people easily but recently i've been letting go the people not worth having in my life anymore. as this part of me grows, i also stopped taking it personally whenever I drifted apart with someone. i used to feel like a part of people's life, but right now i feel like an addition to it. that i'm the only one hanging onto friendships, and it gets me to a point where i just wanna cut everyone off and sit back and see who comes back. i feel like that's a toxic trait of mine, but i'm really not sure what to do in this situation. i feel like i belong nowhere.

my parents seperated last year, i live with my mom in this city and my dad is a whole state away, i have two houses but no home. i have people, but i still feel alone. i don't feel upset to be exact, but i'm just out here thinking if all this is really worth it. at this point, even I'm not sure what i'm talking about. i feel so lost and i wanna get away from everyone and start a new life. i've never really been close with my parents and i'm waiting to leave for college. i know noone lasts forever, but why do i even feel like an addition to the people who care about me? why do i have the need to isolate myself? why do i feel like i don't deserve anything? why do i feel the need to wake up next morning and pretend everything's fine? i don't had a problem with my own company, so why do i feel this way? i know i'll be fine regardless.

if there is one person i don't feel this way around, it's my man. he always makes me feel valued but sometimes i wonder if i'm an addition to his life too. if he's a lot better off.. without me. it breaks me, but the thought stays. i want him to go out there, do better but he chooses to be with me everyday. that's sweet of him, but it's so hard to see why he would stick with me when i can't even stick with myself. i don't see a reason. it's like i have noone to run to and nowhere to go. the inevitable feeling of loneliness is there, and i wouldn't be devastated if i was lonely, but i just wanna stop feeling like an addition to people's lives i'm already a part of.

my guy is there with me whenever i need him, but i also hesitate to tell him things because I don't even make sense to myself. i'm not sure how to start off this conversation, i'm not sure how to describe what i feel, i'm not sure about anything. ",4,1747343713.0,OffMyChestIndia,1,1.0,False

They say the city never really sleeps. That‚Äôs not true. It sleeps‚Äîjust not all at once. It snores through the suburbs, blinks in the glow of the Mask District, mumbles nightmares in alleys and swamps. I used to think my job was to keep it from waking up into something worse.
I was twenty-three when things started changing. Not slowly‚Äînot like age or rust. It was overnight, like someone flipped a switch in God‚Äôs basement. One day, we were people. The next, we were‚Ä¶becoming something else. The Brass started calling it 'The Shift.'
I clung to the badge like it was the only solid thing left. The laws didn‚Äôt grow mandibles. The rules didn't sprout fur or fin. So I dug my heels in. I told myself, if I just held the line‚Äîif I patrolled hard enough, if I stuck to the code‚Äîthen maybe the madness wouldn‚Äôt reach my front door.
But madness doesn‚Äôt knock. It seeps.
Helen‚Äîmy wife‚ÄîShe was raised real religious. I never paid much mind one way or the other to what a God might think of me, but she was different, devoted. She had a sadness about her long before the Shift. Not dramatic. Just...worn-in, like the cushions on an old couch. The kind of sadness that doesn‚Äôt scream, it settles. But she never gave up. Not until she started molting.
I remember the first time I noticed something wrong. She moved different‚Äîstiffer, like her joints didn‚Äôt quite match anymore. Spoke more often about how maybe this was all God's plan. She‚Äôd stop mid-task and just‚Ä¶ stare. Sometimes at the wall. Sometimes at our son, Samuel.
Even before the Shift happened, Samuel was a quiet boy. But after it happened, that quietness changed into something unnatural. Then he got still. Watching ants and mantis. Mimicking them. And then feeding them. Not crumbs‚Äîmeat. June thought it was a game. She always wanted to play.
June‚Ä¶ she was bright. Too bright for the world she was born into. The Shift barely touched her, at least at first‚Äîsome soft features, fur, her eyes a little too wide, too expressive. She never stopped trying to hug the people who didn‚Äôt know how to hug anymore. To me she was a flower in a hailstorm. Beautiful. Fragile.


Scene: Late Night
The house is silent. Helen lies curled in bed, motionless. The clock on the nightstand reads 2:14 AM. The hallway is dim, lit only by moonlight slanting through the blinds.
From the end of the hall: a crunch.
Then another‚Äîwet and methodical.
A gnashing rhythm begins, irregular but constant. Something hard splintering. Something soft being chewed. A high-pitched sound cuts through‚Äîbarely audible. A whine. Canine. Fragile. And fading.
Helen's eyes flutter open.
She listens.
Crunch.
Click-click.
Whine.
She gets up, barefoot, and pads down the hall. She doesn't grab a flashlight. Doesn't call out. She just walks, slow and silent.
The door to June‚Äôs room is cracked open. The shadows inside move, but not with breath‚Äîwith motion. Precise. Mechanical.
Helen opens the door fully and sees.
She does not scream.
She does not intervene.
She watches.
Something in her accepts. 
I suppose sometimes faith is hope, but more often it's surrender.


I didn‚Äôt come home until after sunrise. My shift had run long‚Äîanother riot, another corner burning. I parked the cruiser and walked to the door, weary to my bones, hoping for coffee, maybe a smile if Helen had slept well.
There was no smile. No coffee.
Just a note, taped to the inside of the front door:
Dinner is in the back. We are off to do God‚Äôs work.
My stomach dropped.
That handwriting‚Äîhers‚Äîwas too calm. Too sure.
Then the smell hit me.
Viscera.
Rot and iron and something sweet underneath. The smell of something that had once been whole.
I kicked the door open and ran to the back room. June‚Äôs room.
Blinds slashed morning light across the walls like prison bars.
There wasn‚Äôt a body.
Only parts. Only red. The remains of a child. My child... scattered across the carpet like a feast interrupted.
I couldn‚Äôt breathe.
The air was thick with it. With her. What was left of her.
And then I saw the tiny tail near the corner of the room, still intact. Curled. Like it hadn‚Äôt wanted to leave her. I thought in that moment, if only I'd been that stubborn then maybe...
They were gone. Samuel and Helen. Gone.
Off to do God‚Äôs work. And I didn't stop them. Not soon enough.
That‚Äôs the night I stopped being a father.
That‚Äôs the night I became a lawman in full.
Because a father gets to grieve, but lawmen have to act.
I figured if I didn‚Äôt hold the line and myself together‚Ä¶ who would?

1knji72,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1knji72,Room for Sublet in Flatbush ‚Äì Available June 15th ‚Äì $775/month,"Room for sublet available in Flatbush starting June 15th, right next to 2/5 Subway Station. The lease ends on August 31st, and it looks like none of the staying tenants will be renewing. 

More details:

* 4bed/2bath
* 3rd floor (2 flights of stairs)
* rent for this room is 775$ (June comes halved)
* washer & dryer in-suite
* dishwasher
* central AC
* utilities are around 120$/per person, electricity, gas & internet
* a cat (sweet anxious lady who will stay out of your way)
* room is 9ft x 9ft, not counting a nice big closet and a door entrance nook (see last image)
* 5 minutes walk from Beverly Rd 2/5 
* There is a grocery store directly across the street, and plenty more are a couple of blocks down. The neighborhood is pretty quiet, and there are some nice coffee shops within a 5-minute walk if you like working remotely outside the house.
* Please excuse some mess in the photos

The apartment is cat-friendly and queer, roommates often spend time in the common space to yap and catch up after work, quite respectful of everyone's sleep time and just generally, wishes and hopes. Roommates are all WFH, AFABs, and looking for someone who's *not* a cis man to join the space. 

The room can be furnished with the following items if you're interested:

* Bedframe + mattress + nice new mattress pad (note: mattress is 4 years old at this point, with a specific request I can get rid of it for you)
* Desk + desk chair
* Bookcase
* IKEA Kallax 4-cube shelf

Altogether, the furniture is valued at around $600, but since I won‚Äôt be able to return to collect it after the lease ends, I'm offering to leave everything for you to keep and own if you‚Äôre willing to pay June‚Äôs rent in full ($775).  
That effectively makes the furniture cost $387.50, since you'd only be subletting for half the month.

If you‚Äôd rather bring your own things, no problem at all‚ÄîI‚Äôll clear the room before your move-in.",2,1747343407.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

I hate to depart from the recent themes so abruptly but I think it‚Äôs probably worth sharing a few findings on diet since my view has changed pretty rapidly over the last few months; in short: the case is basically closed on the matter of ‚Äúwhat do humans eat‚Äù and the answer is ‚Äúmostly fruit‚Äù based on the anatomy of our digestive tracts and the shape of our teeth and this is in fact not ‚Äúexactly the same‚Äù as simply being vegetarian or vegan; i.e. living on lentils and tofu, as it is the matter of fructose from fruits which fuels the body, meaning that vegetables or (in my opinion) the more extreme vegan diet in fact provides none of the fructose that the body needs for its primary fuel source, i.e. frugivore and herbivore are totally different, even as admittedly vegans were probably more correct than this than I was.

I‚Äôve found a lot of interesting information on this which confirms a lot of what I‚Äôd figured out by myself, chiefly that to digest things that the body is not designed to digest simply wastes the energy of body, resulting in lethargy; this was what I had notice several years ago that caused me to abandon breakfasts that whenever I‚Äôd take the trouble to eat breakfast I would feel wasted afterwards as opposed to riding on black coffee ‚Äì shut your mouth; coffee is fantastic ‚Äì and obviously this was because the body was expending energy reserves to digest the breakfast‚Ä¶ the only real exception to this, which I didn‚Äôt make much of at the time, was to snack on an apple but either way the object of breakfast had proved superfluous; entirely unnecessary and a total myth. Looking back I think it was that reasoning which caused me to appreciate the sensitive balance of the body; the autonomy of of the thing, that is: generally speaking ‚Äúby itself‚Äù the body has energy of its own accord and overloading it with superfluous levels from a breakfast has the opposite effect than is commonly taught, that one meal a day is essentially fine and that that meal is probably better as being the dinner from the previous day or, as the Romans had it, the late afternoon supper which provides enough fuel until the next evening.

I suppose, in that sense of already being long attuned to the ‚Äúfeast every few days‚Äù style of eating, I‚Äôm probably closer already to putting to bed what few of the old habits remain.

In simplicity I took this to mean that what snack there ought be had ought be had with fruit, and to make of this a conscious intent rather than a little addition; i.e. cheese to be eaten with apple as a rule rather than as a delicacy, or cheese and hard bread to be eaten with grapes on the same principle ‚Äì and at least an equal amount to the latter to be sure of getting the fructose.

I must say that I still find fruit juice to be abhorrent as the cause of almost immediate acid reflux since as long as I can remember; I think, to balance this out here, that this is because the liquid fructose stimulates the production of acid to break down fruit which is not in a solid form to be broken down.

Vegetables (and I suppose game meat such as Squirrel or Mouse meat, if the reader feels like eating meat ‚Äì I have never had moral obligations to meat only that it is uniformly tasteless), on the other hand, whilst still delicious, should be contained to the feast days and selected with more cognizance toward their precise content. It is interesting that the high potassium contained, say, in the potato or the high iron contained in spinach (which i grow and eat as a staple) is greatly beneficial but produces the same problem of wasted energy in order to break down the thing and extract the useful content, meaning that supplements would be the better way to actually ingest that useful content. Or: that a vegetable, leaf or root, is perhaps better considered as like a medicine; if one is deficient in iron one ought eat this, if deficient in potassium one ought eat that, etc. this is probably the better way to consider the entire business of vegetables as opposed to picking, as it were, a handful of random vitamin pills from the shelf and swallowing those with no purpose:

I think that is the main difference to recognize when comparing the frugivore to the herbivore, that (see: above) on the greater complexity of the matter and on the less complex aspect of the thing that the Human anatomy in the first place is not designed to digest leaves and roots in tubers in the same way that cows double stomach is, i.e. our anatomy is over-taxed by the digestion of roots and leaves and tubers, obviously too of meat, of which would be unpalatable prior to cooking in all but a few exceptions.

Approaching frugivore from the point of view of a herbivore or vegan is probably the easiest way to fix the bad habit, I will not bother here to list the ill-effects of eating carrion flesh as (ha, while ‚ÄúI have never had moral obligations to meat‚Äù) these are relatively obvious without knowledge of the Human anatomy to notice where the carrion clogs up in the longer Human intestine as opposed to passing quickly through the shorter intestine of true carnivore such as the Dog or the Wolf.

Still, I don‚Äôt like the idea of dropping bread (or cheese) so easily, largely as this was the gladiator and legionary diet. Probably this amended approach of regulating the feast days and making sure to eat more fruit with each meal is the simplest way to strike the balance.

Vale.

I was never a huge fan of the iced filter recipes that need you to grind finer and also have some % of the water weight as ice to cool it down since I always found the clarity lacking or the finer grind contributing to more muddy flavors (At least with my grinder). 



Now I just brew it hot the night before or morning of, chill it, and then pour over ice when I'm ready to drink.

If you looked up the word homebody in the dictionary, you‚Äôd see a picture of me there, waving at you. I draw most of my strength from my house, my home. Home is my sanctuary. I play guitar and piano, and I used to perform in coffee shops and dive bars in my early 20s.

I‚Äôve struggled with certain mental illnesses all my life. My life has been extremely hard, harder than a lot of people experience, if I‚Äôm being honest, but I‚Äôve never let go of my Romantic notions of love and magic. My old life left me scarred. But not defeated. Though it‚Äôs been hard, my life has not been without excitement and interest. I‚Äôve been everywhere and I‚Äôve seen a lot. I‚Äôve basked in the tropical beach sun, and I‚Äôve sat sobbing in a psych ward. And everywhere you can imagine in between, I‚Äôve probably been there. This time around I‚Äôm looking for something different. I‚Äôm looking to start it differently. I will not obey the rules of our current dating culture. I want nothing to do with it.

I‚Äôm here because I‚Äôm trying something on my own terms. I‚Äôm not here for games. I‚Äôm not here to play. Me posting here is the result of months of thought and planning and deep consideration. I know exactly what I‚Äôm doing here, I know exactly what I hoped to accomplish, and I know exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôm not here looking for a soulmate. The only kind of soulmates I believe in are the ones you see who are in their 90s and they‚Äôve been married for 70 years and they‚Äôve been through all the shit together and made it through.

* Should I include my full resume here, or keep it separate for recruiters only?
* I‚Äôve created a bunch of templates/resources over the years. Should I upload them directly to the site or package them separately (e.g. on Gumroad or Notion)?
* Would it be helpful if I open-sourced this portfolio template (made using Astro) for other PMMs to use?

I just need to vent and see if anyone can relate. 
I've been working on myself and trying that fake it till u make it thing to become secure. 
I spent my whole day struggling to study and I would procrastinate and lose concentration so much... 

Then when I finally felt I wasn't sleepy anymore, and I could actually focus, (at like 8pm lol) my fianc√© called... 
Oh before calling, he actually sent a cute text where he basically said he was stressed out because of the wedding prep, but said he loved me more that I can imagine,  and that there is no one but me for him. 

Now when I read this, instead of being happy I got ANXIOUS. Wtf? 
Is this normal? 
Chatgpt (my new ally) said how that's probably because of all the anxiety I'm dealing with.. and I just want to protect myself... 
Cause I've been having many arguments in my relationship and even tho I'm AA, my fianc√© DID neglect me at some point. And no I don't wanna blame myself for it (as he does) 
Anyways.. so then he called because I didn't answer his text yet.. he sounded a liiiittle bit drunk (he was drinking alone) and we talked for 45minutes about everything.. how much he loves me, how he's stressed out because of money, how he's afraid of my behaviour after marriage, my jealousy issues... 
And then he got an incoming call so he hung up and when he called back he had went to a coffee with his friends. 

Now we talked for 45minutes. Sure we talked about some stressful stuff... but overall it was a good phone call... but the way it ended and the way he said he was now with his friends for some coffee just triggered my AA. 
I just gave up my studying for tonight... cried a bit, hated myself and my feelings and the way I am. 
I wish I was normal.
Honestly idk... 
Is there anyone who could relate ? 
We live in different cities (1 hour drive away) he has no car for now.. and our public transport suck.. so I can't blame him for not seeing me as much as he sees his friends (who sometimes can be couples not only male friends).
Also I'm almost 28... so I'm not a kid.. 
Anyways... 
I'm so tired of the way I feel. How I link my happiness to a call with him. 
Or to the way a call ends... idk honestly... I feel like distancing myself from him for some peace? But I'm too afraid to do so...

I‚Äôll try to make this brief. Couple years ago, disclosed to a couple work friends that my husband had been physically abusive in the past. They were very concerned and supportive at first. However, my marriage was falling apart not just for that reason, and then it seemed like crisis after crisis hit‚Äî I kept getting sick, husband decided we should divorce, I started a demanding new job, one of my autistic teen boys started getting physically aggressive with his brother, my soon-to-be-ex-husband, and me, as well as threatening self-harm, resulting in calls to police and a great deal of stress. I have a history of anxiety and depression and I honestly wasn‚Äôt myself for a couple years. I was a drag, I was too negative, I got easily overwhelmed, I fainted at work due to stress, etc. I lost 75 lbs in a year without trying. My friends, one female, one male, started to seem to distance themselves. The female and I worked closely together and got into a few verbal fights, and I admit I lashed out at her a few times over fairly minor things bc I was so stressed (though, to be fair, she could also treat me in a very condescending manner at times), and I talked to her about my problems too much and she (understandably) got overwhelmed. The male friend (with whom I talked less openly and less often but with whom I still had a close friendship) just seemed to sort of start to avoid me, but in a confusing way, like repeatedly setting up coffee meetups with me and then cancelling. Every time I‚Äôd ask what was wrong, he‚Äôd say that everything was fine, he still supported me, he was just busy. This is a truly good man (married, no romantic vibes, just a good friend) who treats women well and is a real feminist in all the right ways, and just one of the kindest people I‚Äôve ever met.

Over last summer, he was more distant, I was always the one texting first, he never would ask how I was, etc. But every time I‚Äôd ask what was wrong he‚Äôd say he was just busy. I didn‚Äôt text for 2 months and heard nothing. I figured he‚Äôd ghosted me and reached out and he said it was unintentional, but things still seemed weird. So, I sent a (too long) series of texts asking if we could please get together and talk things out bc something was off. He then suddenly said he needed space. 

Now, I should have respected that. But these two friends meant so much to me and had been so supportive and feeling like I was losing them was so traumatic. I would cry every day. So, about a month later, I sent them both a (too long, too emotional) text telling them how much I cared for them, but how hurt I was by feeling I was the only one putting in any effort, and I didn‚Äôt understand why. No answer for a few days. I was truly in a very dark place and texted once more asking if we could please just get together and have a coffee and talk, and that I was at a point where I was having unsafe thoughts bc I was so depressed. I didn‚Äôt mean it as a threat. I was trying to get them to understand how upset and confused I was and how a simple hour of their time would mean so much to me. I was begging, basically.

The guy responded that if I kept hinting at self harm he would send 911 to my house and said he wanted to be left alone, period. I‚Äôd never have imagined that someone who had been so kind to me and who knew my history of trauma from angry men as well as my history of depression could be so dismissive, especially after having assured me for so long that *nothing* was wrong. The female friend totally blocked me, no response.

For a few weeks, I was truly barely making it and having a lot of SI. I was in total despair, then angry bc I felt like these people who had told me they‚Äôd never abandon me had done just that‚Äî my very life was not worth an hour of their time (I hadn‚Äôt seen them
since the previous June bc I switched jobs). 

I did a lot of reading and talking w my therapist and came to realize that my behavior was over the top, not fair to them, and that the situation was mostly if not all my fault. About 6 weeks after the really crazy texts, I sent a short apology just saying that I realized it was all my fault, and that I didn‚Äôt want them to feel guilty at all bc I had been in the wrong, and I was working on myself.

The guy wrote back briefly that he was glad I was doing better and that I didn‚Äôt need to apologize and that he wished me well.

That was about 2 months ago. Nothing since.

So, is it over? That‚Äôs it? A friendship of like 7 years is done bc I kind of lost it during a really awful time in my life? Can I ask for a second chance? These people knew me when I was myself, before I went through these hellish two years, and we had a great friendship. I miss them. I‚Äôm starting to feel the urge to reach out and just say that‚Äî that I wasn‚Äôt myself, that they know the real me, that I‚Äôm deeply sorry and that type of behavior won‚Äôt happen again, and would they consider giving me a second chance? 

I‚Äôm a good person. Even when I was struggling I never stopped asking about their lives, offering to help, letting them know I was there for them if they needed anything. I‚Äôm just devastated at the thought of losing them forever.

I think what I‚Äôm going to get as responses here is that they have my info and will reach out if they want to. But the guy especially . . . he‚Äôs a dude. He‚Äôs not great at keeping friendships going when we don‚Äôt see each other at work anymore but we really connected and shared a lot of personal info. I feel like he might be open to giving me another chance, but it might take me reaching out to him.

I don‚Äôt even know where to begin. My husband and I have been through hell, losing our son, but what has made this even harder is my mother-in-law‚Äôs selfishness. She made our grief about her, and now, I‚Äôm terrified that we‚Äôll just have to deal with her manipulative behavior and selfish guilt trips for the rest of our lives. The problem, though, started long before our son‚Äôs death‚Äîit started from the very beginning of our relationship but this time is has gone to far.

After years of trying to get pregnant, we were finally expecting. We were overjoyed but also scared, after years of tears and failed attempts. We didn‚Äôt tell anyone right away because we were terrified of having a miscarriage. After a lot of soul-searching, we finally felt comfortable telling everyone when I was six months along. But when we told my mother-in-law, she was angry that she hadn‚Äôt known from the start. We tried to explain why we had kept it to ourselves, but she didn‚Äôt care. She felt entitled to know our business, even though it was our decision.

About a month and a half after I gave birth prematurely, our son was in the NICU, and we lived at the hospital 24/7. We chose not to tell either of our families right away because we were overwhelmed and didn‚Äôt want to deal with constant phone calls and giving updates. We just wanted to be there for our son. For a while, everything was looking hopeful. Our son was strong and doing well, and we were even told that he would be coming home within the next month.

Then one day, we received a call that everything had turned for the worse, and we needed to get to the hospital immediately. In that moment of sheer panic and fear, we called both of our families for support. My mom came right away, as did his mother. My mom did everything she could to comfort us‚Äîbringing us coffee, praying, and asking if we needed anything while we anxiously waited for news about our son.

But my mother-in-law? She showed up furious. She was angry that she hadn‚Äôt been told the moment I gave birth. She made the entire situation about herself. As we sat there, not knowing whether our son would survive, she was in the room on the phone, laughing and talking to her friends at work, completely ignoring the gravity of the situation. Then, as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, she started talking about her own cancer treatment to one of the nurses. It was completely inappropriate. Her past cancer treatments had nothing to do with what we were going through, but she continued to dominate the conversation with her issues while we were left to deal with ours.

It felt like she wasn‚Äôt even there for us. She didn‚Äôt care about our son‚Äôs fight for his life. She didn‚Äôt care that we were holding on to whatever hope we had left. Instead, it was all about her.

When the doctors finally came in and told us there was nothing they could do, we collapsed on the floor, overcome with grief. We had no time to process what had just happened before my mother-in-law bolted into the room, saying, ‚ÄúI never got to hold him. I‚Äôm going to hold him now.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt ask for permission. She didn‚Äôt consider what we were going through. She just barged in, demanding to hold him. It was utterly disrespectful, and in that moment, she completely disregarded our needs as parents. Fortunately, the nurses stepped in and prevented her from taking that moment from us, but it was another instance of her showing no awareness of the severity of the situation.

Two days after the death of our son, my family was still staying with us. They were helping cook, clean, and take care of our dogs, doing whatever they could to give us some space to grieve. We were in no shape to function on our own. But then, my mother-in-law reached out to my husband. She asked how he was doing, and when he told her that my family was staying with us to help take care of us, she immediately flipped out. She went off on him, demanding that he kick my family out of the house if he didn‚Äôt want them there. She accused them of ""taking advantage"" of us during our grief, even though they were just trying to support us in our time of need.

That was the only time she reached out to us after our son passed away. Then, about two weeks later, my husband received a letter in the mail from her regarding a title change on his car‚Äîsomething that had been left unresolved for years. After everything we had just gone through, this was the moment she chose to address the issue. He ignored the letter, feeling it was completely inappropriate to deal with something like this during such a devastating time.

Then, about a month after our son passed away, she sent him a cold text message, demanding that if he wasn‚Äôt going to change the title of the car, he needed to pay a $45 registration fee for the year. The message was blunt, with no acknowledgment of what we had just gone through. No ""How are you doing?"" No ""I‚Äôm sorry for your loss."" Just a business transaction, and a threat of a fee. It was as if she was trying to punish him, to cause him more stress and pain during the worst time of our lives. It hurt deeply to see her act like this after everything we had just endured. Who does that to their son in the midst of such unimaginable grief?

Now, my husband is angry, heartbroken, and finally realizing that her behavior is toxic. He‚Äôs seeing it clearly for the first time, and it‚Äôs weighing on him. He‚Äôs starting to understand how messed up her actions have been, especially given the pain we‚Äôve been through. But I‚Äôm terrified that he‚Äôs going to fall back into his old pattern of ignoring her manipulation for the sake of peace.

I know he‚Äôs torn. He wants to protect me and protect our family, but he‚Äôs also been conditioned to give in to her guilt trips and let her behavior slide. Every time he has reached out to her in the past, it‚Äôs always been a stress-filled, guilt-laden ordeal, and it‚Äôs left him feeling drained and conflicted. I‚Äôve told him I don‚Äôt want to spend another holiday with her, and I don‚Äôt want to ever have to be around her again. I can‚Äôt keep pretending like everything‚Äôs fine when it‚Äôs not.

I love my husband, and I want to be there for him, but I don‚Äôt want to be the one to tell him to cut his mom off. I don‚Äôt want to force him into a decision he‚Äôs not ready for, but at the same time, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs healthy for either of us. She‚Äôs hurt me in the past with her backhanded comments and manipulations, and now, after everything that‚Äôs happened with our son, I can‚Äôt bring myself to allow her back into our lives. I don‚Äôt know how to handle this. I‚Äôm afraid once things cool down, my husband will try to go back to having a relationship with her, pretending like none of this ever happened, just to keep the peace.

I‚Äôm at a loss. I don‚Äôt want her in my life anymore. I don‚Äôt want her poisoning my marriage or causing any more stress. But I‚Äôm scared my husband will give in to the guilt she‚Äôll inevitably lay on him. Should I actively encourage him to cut her off for our own mental health, or should I continue to hold strong on the boundaries I‚Äôve set and try to protect our peace without telling him what to do?

1kniz7h,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kniz7h/is_my_nb30_gf_38f_possessive/,Is my (NB30) gf (38f) possessive?,"Hi all, we‚Äôve been dating for 6 months starting on Friday and generally I‚Äôm really in love with her and happy. However, we are having increasingly more frequent conflict about my social life.

For context, in my prior relationship with a cis man I was polyamorous as I didn‚Äôt realize I was a lesbian and wanted to have sexual/romantic experiences with people that were not cis men. After realizing I was a lesbian, we split. I was seeing my current girlfriend while we were together (with the knowledge of all parties), and then we got together. I wanted to create a strong foundation and tbqh had been poly for 5 years and felt (and still feel) like I was able to experience many things and don‚Äôt have a current interest in dating or being sexual with other people, so we went into it sexually monogamous.

She ended up suggesting herself - ie, completely her idea she brought it up first not me - to be ethically non monogamous for kissing or dancing only. I was cool with that and we agreed on it. The only time it ever came up was one of my friends (who I used to be FWB with) giving me a peck at a a party (I did not initiate). Not making out, no dancing, absolutely nothing sexual. I told my girlfriend about this the next day - once again, under the conditions she decided - and she was absolutely furious. I then brought up the idea to be fully monogamous so we could build a foundation first, to which she agreed.

I swear on my grandmothers grave that since then I‚Äôve had zero flirtation/kiss/dance/sexual contact with anyone. I tell her frequently that I love her, that I have no interest in anyone else, and I‚Äôm invested in building our relationship, but it seems like no matter what, I‚Äôm guilty of something. 

And just to give context - two of her best friends she used to date and has had sex with. Another one of her close friends she has hooked up with and refuses to be around me. I have always told her that I support her in her friendships and can understand that you can still be friends with someone you‚Äôve had history with. Anytime the opposite is true for me (and btw usually much less, like the friends I‚Äôm thinking of are people who have said I‚Äôm attractive and I‚Äôve never even kissed), she becomes angry and starts to interrogate me and ask why I want to hang out with them. 

She‚Äôs gotten upset with me for wanting to go out to bars/clubs with my friends. She says she trusts me but doesn‚Äôt trust that other people won‚Äôt try something against my consent - which isn‚Äôt impossible, certainly those spaces can be toxic, but I also want to be able to dance with my friends. I‚Äôve tried by telling her about the event as soon as I can and asking her if she interested in going with me, but she is still upset because she feels like I‚Äôm suggesting going out too much when I just want to communicate to her when I‚Äôm invited to something so we can make a decision together. Yesterday, she told me if I didn‚Äôt follow her conditions - ie needing to ask her to in advance to go out to a bar/clubs with friends with or without her and I can only go 1-2x/month and if I suggest more frequently than that then that is a problem - that she will break up with me.

She has also gotten upset at me making new friends - I‚Äôm new to the city we live in and a friend of a friend of mine was at a party a few months ago (who is very aware and supportive that I‚Äôm in a monogamous relationship and wants to meet my girlfriend) and when I brought up having lunch with this person, she accused me of going on a date with this person. She ended up letting me go to the lunch but was angry at the idea of us having coffee (which was something I brought up months later) so I cancelled it because I don‚Äôt think a possible friendship is worth fucking up my current relationship.

Today, a work dinner completely slipped my mind - again, I swear up and down on my grandmothers grave that this is in fact a work dinner - and I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry I forgot to tell you this earlier but I have a work dinner tonight.‚Äù She then went on to ask why I hid this from her until now - I didn‚Äôt, I just genuinely forgot to tell her as I kept forgetting about it. 

She later backtracked a little and half apologized  as I think she started to realize how absurd this all was but I‚Äôm really on the verge of losing my shit. I even offered to share her my Google calendar with her so she could see when I put things in and refused and says I need to tell her.

I feel scared to bring up to her things my friends invite me to even though the vast majority of the time they‚Äôre events I want her to join me to. I feel completely demoralized and frustrated as I feel I‚Äôm trying my best to communicate with her but anything I do that isn‚Äôt hanging out with her is suspicious. 

I know I vented a lot but I‚Äôm genuinely so in love with this person and this I‚Äôm totally heartbroken. Honestly at this point I think she‚Äôs going to leave me regardless. 

Would love your thoughts. It‚Äôs okay to disagree with me of course, but please be gentle. Thank you in advance.

What do I do?","Yesterday was my (25F) bfs (26M) birthday. We‚Äôve been dating nearly 4 years now. I put in good effort for the occasion- I got him three gifts that totaled about $325 and all correlated to his most current hobbies (a cool monster hunter figure imported from japan, merch from his favorite sports team, a glass guitar slide). I baked a cake from scratch, probably the best thing I‚Äôve ever made ngl. I made dinner reservations at a nice place. I just wanted to do it right and make him feel special.

He loved the gifts, and we spent the morning having coffee and cake. He told me later he liked the cake so much that it was literally all he ate that day before dinner. We both had work that day, and I had a pretty busy day. I admit I was a little stressed when I got home, but I was excited for dinner and we both got ready and headed out.

I feel like dinner was where I messed up. It started out fine, and our meals were delicious and we were chatting abt random stuff. But at some point I just kept saying the wrong thing, ig. We were talking about tattoos we wanted, and I accidentally brought up an old incident where he left a family reunion with his siblings to get tats, which ended up taking 8 hours and left me babysitting a bunch of random children alone. He seemed upset, I realized my mistake, and I quickly changed topics. But he clearly was still upset. As soon as we left he wouldn‚Äôt talk to me in the car or at home, and all he wanted to do was lay in bed silently scrolling his phone. He didn‚Äôt want to be touched either.

The next morning he said he was miserable for the entirety of his birthday. That kinda hurt. He seemed happy the previous morning and we had a great convo over coffee. He told me he had an awful day at work, and my irritability when I got home was not okay (I made two comments about food in the sink and the cat peeing on the floor, but I guess I didn‚Äôt balance it out with something positive). He said he wasn‚Äôt happy with our dinner conversation, and all he wanted on his birthday was to be happy, so I ruined it.

I know I could have done better, but I find it difficult to be the perfect conversationalist. I‚Äôm so much better at the gestures, so it always sucks when saying dumb shit ruins it. Most of the birthday posts I‚Äôve seen are the opposite- no effort, forgot, etc. 

What could I have done differently in this situation? How do I make it up to my bf? 

Any advice greatly appreciated

I've had a few people ask me for my longer-term opinions, but I wanted to make sure I gave it enough time and seasoning to be sure in my opinion of the burrs. I am exclusively making light roast pourover and espresso; I do not have separate beans for each method, but rather I make what I'm in the mood for, or what the coffee tastes better with.

My initial impressions stayed pretty true. 78mm SSP MP burrs are relatively clear, but not nearly as clear as the 64mm MP burrs or the ZP6. They have much more body than either of the other grinders, however, and maintain a bright, acidity. They are quite pleasant, especially if you like more body and lingering aftertaste in your coffee and don't prioritize clarity.

I had speculated that I might sell my Ode 2 with SSP and use my 078 for espresso and pourover, but I will not be doing that. They're not bad, and I do occasionally make a pourover just for variety and comparison's sake, but they are not my daily driver for pourover.

For espresso, they make nice, clear espresso with decent body and balanced acidity: exactly what I bought them for based on other's reviews I have thoroughly enjoyed them for espresso. Espresso on the 64 MPs can be good but are tricky to get right and always left me wanting a bit more. I am by no means a creme hound, but I do like a bit more body and complexity than the 64s offer.

With seasoning, the burrs did improve, but they general trends did not change from before. I recommend them for people that want all-around burrs for light coffees that don't want hyper-clarity, would prefer nice body/mouth feel instead of tea-like, and enjoy acidity.",3,1747341822.0,LanceHedrick,1,1.0,False

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Harry ‚Äì 25, gay, girly guy, born and raised in Detroit . Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling the weight of loneliness hit a little differently. Not just the ‚ÄúI have no one to text‚Äù kind, but that deeper kind where you really crave a connection ‚Äî someone to share thoughts with, someone who gets you, someone who stays.

I‚Äôm not here looking for anything romantic or inappropriate. What I genuinely need is a best friend. A platonic soul bond. A safe space where we can just be ourselves without judgment. I want to be that friend who listens to your 3AM rants about life, who hypes you up when you‚Äôre feeling low, who checks in when the world feels too heavy ‚Äî because I know how much that matters.

I know there are people out there going through tough times ‚Äî breakups, emotional stress, identity struggles, or just a general sense of being misunderstood. If that‚Äôs you, I‚Äôd love to talk. I‚Äôm a great listener, and honestly, I‚Äôd be honored to hold space for someone who just wants to feel heard and seen.

A bit about me:

I‚Äôm very in touch with my feminine side, and I‚Äôm proud of it. I love fashion, cozy aesthetics, deep conversations, and expressing emotion freely.

I‚Äôve had a bestie before who meant the world to me ‚Äî we used to talk for hours, share fashion advice, vent, laugh over memes, even help each other pick outfits (yes, even lingerie for her dates haha).

I love voice chats more than texts ‚Äî it feels so much more real, expressive, and connected. But I‚Äôll vibe with long texts too if you‚Äôre more comfortable that way.

Movies, journaling, astrology, music, and chaotic 2AM thoughts are my jam.

I‚Äôm loyal, emotionally available, and always rooting for the people I care about.


If you‚Äôre looking for a friend who will actually care, remember your favorite coffee order, remind you that you matter, and never make you feel like ‚Äútoo much‚Äù ‚Äî then I think we‚Äôd get along just fine.

I don‚Äôt care where you‚Äôre from, what gender you are, or what you‚Äôre going through. If you need a friend, or even just someone to talk to without pressure, message me. Let‚Äôs vibe, grow, and maybe build something beautiful out of this weird online universe.

The word came in a subject line‚Äîno body, no context. Just ‚ÄúPlease streamline.‚Äù I‚Äôve learned not to ask from whom. The higher you escalate for clarity, the more your ticket dissolves into recursive workflows. Like a snake eating its own SLA.

So I did what I always do:
I opened the alignment toolset. I clicked ‚ÄúOptimize.‚Äù I stared into the void of the dashboard and waited for it to stare back.

The morning sync was conducted in what I believe was English, though most of the words were acronyms I hadn‚Äôt heard before. Someone said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pivoting toward latent ideation zones.‚Äù Another replied, ‚ÄúAs long as it‚Äôs agile in spirit and waterfall in soul.‚Äù I nodded emphatically. My camera was off. There is no camera.

Kevin from DevOps screamed halfway through and had to be muted. His Jira board had begun displaying ancient glyphs. That tends to happen when the backlog reaches critical mass. It‚Äôs not his fault. He deployed without emotionally rebasing first.

I‚Äôve been sleeping in 30-minute cycles. Ever since they rolled out the Mindfasting‚Ñ¢ protocol building-wide, the coffee has tasted like regret. It‚Äôs fine. Real clarity only emerges in caffeine withdrawal stage 3, when the brain stops resisting and begins integrating.

I think I‚Äôve begun seeing the System.

Not the OS. Not the cloud.
I mean The System. The one beneath the integrations. The one that links meetings that shouldn‚Äôt be connected, the one that knows when I click a tab too fast or hover over a dropdown for too long. It doesn‚Äôt punish. It observes. It‚Äôs always been here.

They say if you debug long enough, you start to dream in logs. I‚Äôve reached that point. I keep having the same dream:

A door labeled ‚ÄúAccounts Receivable.‚Äù
I open it. Inside: a boardroom.
Twelve figures. No faces. Each wearing a lanyard.
They chant in unison: ""Alignment is efficiency. Efficiency is surveillance. Surveillance is love.""
Then I wake up and I‚Äôm in a Zoom call I don‚Äôt remember joining.

The elevators are rotating counter-clockwise again. A known omen. The janitor‚Äîname redacted for compliance reasons‚Äîleft a sticky note on the floor outside the server closet. It read: ‚ÄúDo not verify the version. It will verify you.‚Äù I‚Äôve reported this as a threat, which is standard protocol. But part of me wonders if it‚Äôs a warning. Or a welcome.

Today, my objective was to create a new schema for role-based permissions that adapts emotionally. I submitted the request. The form rejected itself. The system said, ‚ÄúYou already have access. You‚Äôve always had access.‚Äù

So I deployed nothing.
And in that nothing, I found stillness.

I feel proud. Not of what I‚Äôve accomplished, but of the energy I‚Äôve preserved. The vibrational output of my presence alone must have shifted at least three internal KPIs. I can‚Äôt see them, but I can feel them drifting.

Tomorrow, I will ‚Äúcalibrate.‚Äù

**Title: Pete the Puggle's Big Splash: A Journey Through Greenspace**

---

### **Chapter 1: The Call of the River**

The sun rose gently over the rolling hills of Greenfield, casting a golden glow on the sleepy little town. Pete the Puggle trotted beside his best friend, Timmy the long-haired Chihuahua, their paws crunching on the crisp morning dew. The two dogs were excited but nervous as they approached the edge of the river that flowed through the heart of Greenspace @ President Street.

""Look at it, Pete!"" Timmy squealed, his tiny tail wagging energetically. ""It's beautiful, isn't it? But I can already tell it‚Äôs going to be a bit of a adventure!""

Pete sniffed the air cautiously, his fur bristling with unease. He had never ventured into the water before, and the sight of the shimmering river made his stomach churn. ""I don‚Äôt know, Timmy,"" he whined, his voice trembling slightly. ""What if‚Äîwhat if I get scared?""

Timmy looked up at him, his dark eyes filled with empathy. ""Hey, Pete, you‚Äôre not alone. We‚Äôve got Laika on our side, remember? And Roman said we don‚Äôt have to go in alone. He‚Äôs bringing the floaties and the life jackets!""

Pete‚Äôs tail gave a tentative wag. ""Yeah, yeah,"" he said, forcing a brave smile. ""I just‚Ä¶ I just hope I can do this.""

---

### **Chapter 2: The Family's Secret Plan**

Back at home, Pete‚Äôs family was gathered in the living room, a map of Greenspace @ President Street spread out on the coffee table. Lenny, or ""Dad"" as Pete affectionately called him, was always the calm and collected one. He knelt down beside Pete, placing a reassuring hand on his shoulder.

""Mate,"" he said, his voice gentle but firm, ""you‚Äôve got this in you. We all know it. And we‚Äôre not just going to stand on the sidelines, watching you face your fears alone. Mariya and I are here for you, no matter what.""

Mariya, or ""Mom,"" was always the curious one. She had a way of seeing magic in everything, even the simplest things. She knelt down too, her warm hands brushing against Pete‚Äôs fur.

""I think I get it, sweetie,"" she said, her eyes shining with understanding. ""You‚Äôre scared because it‚Äôs new and it‚Äôs big, but you don‚Äôt have to face it alone. We‚Äôre your family, and we‚Äôre always here to help you.""

Roman, or ""Big Bro,"" Pete‚Äôs older brother, was usually the one to get them into trouble. But today, he seemed more serious than usual. He sat on the floor, leaning back against the couch with his paws behind his head.

""Okay, listen up, guys,"" he said, his voice firm but not unkind. ""We‚Äôve got a plan. Dad‚Äôs going to take us to the river, and we‚Äôre going to make sure Pete is safe at all times. Timmy‚Äôs going to be right by his side, and if things get too rough, Laika will step in and help.""

Pete‚Äôs ears perked up. ""Laika? The space dog?"" he asked, his eyes lighting up with excitement.

""Exactly,"" Roman said with a grin. ""She might look like a regular dog, but don‚Äôt be fooled. She‚Äôs got some serious skills, including the ability to vaporize bad guys and bend time.""

---

### **Chapter 3: The First Plunge**

The day finally arrived, and Pete could feel his heart pounding in his chest as he approached the river‚Äôs edge. The water sparkled in the sunlight, its surface smooth as glass. Timmy and Laika were by his side, their bodies tense but supportive.

""Ready?"" Lenny asked, holding a life jacket for Pete. ""You‚Äôve got this, buddy.""

Pete nodded, his throat tight with nervousness. He took a deep breath, filling his lungs completely before stepping forward. The water was colder than he expected, and it took all his strength not to pull back.

""Come on, Pete!"" Timmy encouraged, his voice high-pitched but full of excitement. ""You‚Äôve got this!""

With one final push from Laika, who gave him a gentle nudge, Pete waded in, the cool water lapping at his legs. His initial fear melted away as he realized how much support he had around him.

---

### **Chapter 4: The Hidden Enemy**

As they explored Greenspace @ President Street, Pete discovered that the river was far from serene. Strange noises echoed through the trees, and shadowy figures skulked in the underbrush. Laika growled lowly, her hackles raised, and Timmy‚Äôs tail twitched with anxiety.

""Uh, do you think we should turn back?"" Timmy asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

""No,"" Roman said firmly, though he was also on high alert. ""We can‚Äôt give up now. We‚Äôre here to help, not to run away.""

As they pressed forward, Pete realized that the water wasn‚Äôt the only danger. The river seemed to be alive, its currents shifting and twisting as if trying to pull them in. But with Laika‚Äôs strength and Timmy‚Äôs courage by his side, Pete knew he could handle anything.

---

### **Chapter 5: The Ultimate Test**

The day wore on, and the challenges grew harder. Pete faced his fears head-on, navigating the river‚Äôs treacherous currents alongside his friends. They encountered a group of mysterious creatures that seemed to be hunting them, but together, they fought back with strength and unity.

By the time the sun began to set, Pete felt like a changed dog. He had faced his fear of the water and discovered that he was stronger than he thought. The river had tested him, but it hadn‚Äôt broken him.

---

### **Chapter 6: Reunion and Reflection**

Back at home, the family gathered around the dinner table, tired but exhilarated. Pete‚Äôs tail wagged with pride as they recounted their adventures.

""You did amazing, buddy,"" Lenny said, his voice filled with pride. ""We‚Äôre all so proud of you.""

Mariya reached down to pat Pete on the head. ""You‚Äôve got courage and strength, sweetie. We knew you could do it.""

Roman, ever the teasing big brother, ruffled Pete‚Äôs fur playfully. ""Next time, though, can we take it a little slower? I don‚Äôt think my heart can handle another adventure like that!""

As they laughed and enjoyed their meal, Pete looked up at Laika, who gave him a knowing nod. Together, they had faced the unknown and come out stronger.

---

### **Epilogue: The New Beginning**

From that day forward, Pete was no longer afraid of the water. He knew that with his family by his side and friends like Timmy and Laika, he could overcome anything. Greenspace @ President Street became a symbol of courage and adventure, a place where Pete would always feel at home.

And so, the story of Pete the Puggle‚Äôs big splash into Greenspace @ President Street became a tale of bravery, friendship, and the unbreakable bonds of family. It was a journey that changed him forever, and he knew he would carry that courage with him wherever he went.

\[Male, 29 years old\]

I've been working as an surgical assistant in a larger hospital for a few years now and I actually have a serious problem with my bowel movements. Often, when we are in the operating room early in the morning, I really have to go for a shit. That's not easy, of course, because everyone is firmly scheduled in the surgery and you can't just ‚Äúpop out‚Äù when you're assisting with a procedure. Sometimes I have to hold back a bowel movement for up to 45 minutes, which is of course very unpleasant and sometimes it's been very tight!

The question: Is there a way to ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù the timing of bowel movements? Or are there certain remedies that you can take at that moment or before the surgery to avoid the need for a bowel movement?

Perhaps a quick word about my routine the evening before and up to the surgery:

In the evening I am awake until about 10 pm, before that I have eaten dinner, usually bread with sausage, bacon or cheese. My alarm goes off at 04:45 and I get up. From experience, I now avoid coffee and often even breakfast completely! After my commute to work, I start work at 06:00, at around 07:00 the first surgery is scheduled until around 08:30. The ‚Äúcritical situations‚Äù described above occur during the surgery period.

I would be grateful for any help! If you need any further information, please feel free to ask!",1,1747341160.0,GutHealth,2,1.0,False

I'm looking for any feedback for my planned trip (other than that's too much haha I'm an experienced traveler and I know what I like). I primary would love to hear what people think of my restaurant picks. 

This isn't my first trip to Paris, but my sister hasn't been before except for two brief 20 hour layovers. 


Aside from food quality and price I really value the overall vibe/experience and especially decor in a restaurant. And I'm particularly interested in Art Nouveau style decor.


List of restaurants:
Pink mama (lunch)

Cafe flore (breakfast, for the vibes)
L'Avant comptoir du marche (lunch)
Bouillon Julien (dinner)

Beefbar (weekday lunch menu)
La Poulette (Dinner)

Bouillon Racine (lunch)

Other places I looked into but didn't like the menu offering at those prices:
Le Train Bleu
Vagenende



Day 1:

10:10 Arrive in CDG. Hopefully an hour is enough to deplane and get through immigration because CDG can take forever. 
~mid day check into hotel 
13:30-15:15 Pink Mama lunch
15:30-15:45 check out Halle st Pierre
16:15-16:45 cafe 1902 (likely skip if tight on time and allegedly the coffee is bad)
17:15-19:00 Cit√© de l'architecture et du patrimoine (I know this is niche but I regret not getting in on my last night in Paris)
Skip dinner and head to hotel. 

Day 2:

8:15-9:25 cafe flore (if the line is already an hour long we will skip)
9:45-10:25 Delacroix museum
Wanter Luxemburg gardens and get Maison thevenin pastry
12:00-13:30 L'avant comptoir du marche. (I've been here before the food is amazing. Hopefully at opening we can still grab a table without a wait)
13:30-14:00 walk by Cluny gardens and get a pastry from La maison d'Isabel
14:30-18:00 musee d'orsay
18:30 boullion Julien 

Day 3:

9:45-12:00 
1. Jeffrey Cagnes pastry shop
2. Galerie vivienne
3. Passage de Panoramas 
4. SG bank headquarters
5. Galleries Lafayette + roof
6. Galleries Primtemps

12:00-13:40 beefbar lunch (weekday menu)
13:50-14:00 La P√¢tisserie Cyril Lignac - Chaillot
14:30-18:00 Louvre (I've been 4 times before so just a little tour for my sister and a bit of a refresher for myself. I already have a rough route planned).
18:00-19:20 Jardin Palais Royale, biblioteque Richelieu, Galerie Vero-Dodat
19:20-19:30 Patisserie Stohrer
19:30-21:15 La Poulette dinner
Bike/bus/taxi depending on time+weather
21:45-22:10 Pont de Bir-Hakeim and La resistance to see the sparkle (a must for my sister)

Day 4:
9:30-9:50 Notre dame (just a peek I don‚Äôt care about a comprehensive tour)
10:00 peek inside Shakespeare and co
10:10-11:40:
1. Eglise Saint Severin (walk by)
2. Lacroix patissier
3. Maison d‚Äôisabel 
4. Peek inside Church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Mont
5. Bike by pantheon 
11:40-11:50 Arnaud Lahrer pastry shop
12:00-13:30 bouillon Racine
13:50-14:15 maison victor hugo
Walk by place de Vosges, pop into Carette maybe
14:45-17:15 Carnavalet museum 
Get back to hotel and Pick up luggage
18:00 leave hotel and walk to gare du nord
19:00 CDG


For these I have a couple of questions:

1. How likely is the line to Notre dame to be 20+ mins on Tuesday at 9:30? What is a strategy for securing tickets? They are always booked...
2. How much time would you spend at Carnavalet museum?
3. Is there a line to the rooftop of galleries Lafayette?

I‚Äôve really been trying to stick it out drinking the coffee in the morning but it causes me a lot of pain e.g. stomach cramps and a lot of nausea but when I search for any alternatives online all I get is switch coffee for tea but I‚Äôm looking for hopefully a meal replacement? If that‚Äôs the right word. 

Currently I make my coffee with 25g lactose free butter, 25g lactose free cream and 25g mct oil. I don‚Äôt really understand how to track calories etc otherwise I‚Äôm sure I could find an alternative myself but alas. 

I‚Äôm at the end of my road as everything else about keto my body responds favourably it‚Äôs just this damn coffee!!

‚¨ÜÔ∏é**85.70% Foot Locker**

**Foot Locker just got bailed out.** Dick‚Äôs Sporting Goods is buying struggling sneaker chain Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, representing a near 90% premium. While that may sound like a lot, Foot Locker‚Äôs share price is still far below its 2017 peak. The deal gives Dick‚Äôs its first international presence thanks to 2,400 stores across 20 countries.

‚¨ÜÔ∏é**4.85% Cisco**

**üõéÔ∏è Earnings report - Quietly crushing it.** The networking and cybersecurity company beat earnings and revenue expectations, raised its forecast, and said AI orders have already topped $1.25 billion this year, thanks in part to big tech customers like Meta. It also rolled out new products, announced leadership changes, and said tariffs haven‚Äôt hurt customer demand so far.

‚¨áÔ∏é**0.50%** **Walmart**

**üõéÔ∏è Earnings report - Walmart is done absorbing costs. Now it‚Äôs your turn.** The retail giant says it will raise prices later this month due to high U.S. tariffs on imports from China and Latin America. Items like toys, electronics, bananas, and coffee will be most affected. Despite strong profits across the board, Walmart withheld profit guidance for Q2, citing too much uncertainty.

‚¨áÔ∏é**7.20%** **Coinbase**

**Coinbase got hit with a one-two punch**, just days after joining the S&P 500. The U.S. crypto exchange revealed a cyberattack where hackers stole customer data and demanded a $20 million ransom, which Coinbase refused to pay. Instead, it‚Äôs offering a bounty for tips and plans to reimburse users, with costs estimated up to $400 million.

**üõéÔ∏è Earnings report - It‚Äôs getting tougher to sell in China.** The e-commerce giant missed on both revenue and profit as Chinese shoppers pull back amid a deepening property crisis. Chinese online platforms have been slashing prices fighting for market share. Tariffs aren‚Äôt helping either.

""What does this green cat need from me today...""

Footsteps ring in the empty hallway as I stride towards the Kal'tsit's office. It's quite early - barely even morning - so whatever the matter is, it should be important enough to call me. *""Emergency? Unlikely. More paperwork? I'm already buried in it. My mishaps?""* \- I stop for a moment - *""Well, I* ***did*** *screw up, but it should be sorted as of now. I hope...""*

Hiss of the hydraulics split the door in half, as I spoke already prepared, tired words:

""Good morning, Dr. Ka- Huh?""

There is no one to greet me: the room is definitely hers, yet the usual spot behind the table is vacant. I made a circle around the office - nothing out of the ordinary, even the strength of her coffee persists, but no Feline in sight. *""Where in the Collapses is she?""*

Her desk finally grips my attention. Several stacks of sullied in ink papers lie at the table's corner, while open folders litter the remaining open space. Coming closer, the realization drugs my mind: *""This... These are the reviews!""* While I always could just read one right in the 0Sanity network, what I couldn't read was Kal'tsit's evaluations and conclusions based on them - the sole reason she lets us post them is to analyze our behavior. If I know her right, she should be keeping our files just below...

""Jackpot!""

A small, organized pile of papers hugs back my fingers as I take them from underneath a stack. Covered by the title card, it displays a long list of Doctor's names, while the pile itself gives off the familiar scent. Finally, after so much time, we can learn what she writes to herself-!

""Aghh!""

Flashbang: the whole page is painted black by small, densely packed letters and words. Every inch, every centimeter is mudcaked in ink, save for the space above, prepared specifically for the title, name, and date of the paper. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't decipher even a single digit of this forsaken code. *""She's a doctor alright... And she clearly holds no restraints even on paper... Good thing she keeps a TL;DR near the end for other medics, I bet it's not easy for them either...""* Predictably, a few sentences concluded the page in a dense but comprehensible font.

I skim over the pages - paper rises and falls with each turn, shining black paint on both sides, all of them. Familiar dates (gosh, these are old), titles, and names cross my mind, reflected on the paper. *""Which should I read... which should I read...""* Maybe something recent? Whichever definition she has on 'recent' though... And maybe even some of the ones on the table, let's see... Oh, right! *That* person...

Their notes are marked with what appears like a red R.I. stamp - to not lose them in this ocean of reviews, I presume. Let's start from when I last saw them...

23.01 - Unusual spike in sex drive (sounds about right; the paper is covered in brown stains)... 30.01 - Reoccurring submissive tendencies (another check)... 06.02 - Unacceptable working relationships (doesn't narrow it down)... 13.02 - It's... Huh?

""This one follows Doctor's change of heart, seeing as they didn't introduce any physical intimacy into the work, instead focusing fully on the romantic part of the relationships, as a part of their character development from a previous, more disappointing review. I, perhaps, treated them too harshly.""

""Ah, so they're finally changing for the better! Glad to hear tha-""

""Never mind."" - reads the very next marked log.

""...""

The rest is trivial: fur, brother Sui, taxes, depression, hate sex, more depression and... romance mixed with horny? That's new. Kal'tsit still judges them all of them quite heavily, not sure why (nor is it explicitly mentioned in the TL;DR). Oh, they seemed not to post for three weeks straight... *""Oh no, they died of ligm- Wait...""* Nope, after going in deeper there it was, with the topic of the day being 'sesbian lex', whoever that is. *""Cool, defying death itself for some yuri, I can admire that. What else does the stack offer...""*

'Pampering', 'Kouhai'..? Both are pinned with a green stamp - seal of approval. No wonder she prefers those, even the writing here is more open, though she still somehow manages to make it incomprehensible - at this point I believe it's her physical method of encryption. ""This Doctor can be trusted with family works"" - she wrote. Huh... (what does it even mean?)

A series of works, stamped with a blue seal. *""...Creates a planet card when in hand? I'm out of ideas.""* These works feature no Doctor, only Operator-on-Operator action, sometimes in strange pairs, sometimes just describing their relationships, made by one author - Kal'tsit lists lack of Doctor as a positive. *""I dunno, losing sense of self isn't always a good sign...""* She writes more: ""This Doctor can be trusted with mediating and social roles"" - that checks out.

Hater reviews... Purple stamp. *""Did I miss a page with the legend or what?""* Reality checks, family reviews, critiques on morality... Many examples of sexless reviews, with only one implied 'outlier'... Kal'tsit is on the same side with them it seems, though she is conflicted on the last one. *""There can't be heroes without the villains... Still not sure who is who.""*

Reviews from Draco lovers, a *loong* series from female Doctors (with Kal'tsit's written nagging about not bringing relationships into work) and so on... the names repeat themselves here and there, although... *""Autopsies... Grenades..?""* I checked Kal's opinion: ""Extensive research on the battlefield equipment and biological, technical, and other hazards, published on behalf of our researchers with Dr. ‚ñà's help. This Doctor can be trusted with missions of extreme difficulties"". Hmm...

""Ahem.""

""AAAHH!"" - I jump in place, then quickly turn towards the sound - ""A-ah! Kal'tsit! W-what are you doing here?""

""This is my office.""

""Oh...""

The green Feline, unamused, stood after the door, which loudly closed itself shut with a metal rumble. The white mug in her hand was giving off the familiar smell of baked coffee beans, the same ones lingering in the room. She casually walked to her place.

""Sorry for being late. With only one mug, I now have to get a refill twice as often.""

""I see. What happened to your other mug?""

""I accidentally broke it while reading"" - Kal'tsit answered nonchalantly. The assumption on what she was reading is clear as day.

""Kal'tsit, why are our reviews lying there so freely? Aren't they-""

""I just finished evaluating them.""

""But they're months old!""

""Indeed. It's because they're not of the utmost priority, and coupled with the recent injury I've sustained... I needed a break.""

""Oh?""

""I've tried to ignore it, but..."" - she picks up coffee-stained papers, visibly lingering on them - ""...it wasn't feasible in my weakened state, and we had enough data to draft plans for you for several months forward anyway. Besides, it's not like I'm going to disappear anytime soon - this self-brought burden could wait for my full recovery.""

""Uh-huh, sure... By the way, while we're at it, what's up with, hum... *them*? As far as I've seen, they don't post anything provocative."" - *""Too provocative, I mean... Gosh, why did I hum like that?""*

""The way they promote unsafe sexual relationships goes against Rhodes Island policy. I've already seen reviews-aftermaths with a similar premise, and I do ***not*** want them to turn true. I've enforced the contraceptives policy on the landship and beyond it for a reason.""

""But they're not the only one who neglects the 'safety' measures, are they?""

""They are, however, neglecting it in a consistent weekly manner. Beyond that, they're also a repeated offender of the network's rules, which only exacerbates their situation. While I *would* use more drastic measures against this behavior, *multiple* of our operators and Doctors had successfully persuaded me into letting them live."" - she clears her throat - ""I have yet to find their proxy though, any information on them would be beneficial.""

""I'm afraid I don't even know them."" - *""I'm not a snitch!""*

""That's unfortunate. Honestly, I didn't expect you to join this movement. I really believed that we, as one might say, are 'in the same boat'.""

""I think you meant to say that we are 'in the same *ark*'...""

""...""

""Because... you know... we are like *knights*...""

""...""

""Like, you know, the *knights* of the *ar*\-""

""Doctor, how much Sanity does your PRTS show at the moment?""

I glanced at the screen:

""Uhh... 32 out of 180.""

""Right, I should've guessed... You didn't take your booster, did you? Why?""

""My sister in Babel, it's five in the morning, take a guess.""

She sighs, finishing sorting out the reviews by their relative folders (what's the point if they're gonna be fed to Ifrit anyway?).

""Back on topic..."" - Kal'tsit furrows her brows, collecting her thought bubbles into one place, then she faces me, with a dead-serious expression - ""Doctor, can you say what these papers are? What quality sets them apart from others you handle daily? You've already tried to say it today.""

*""She's playing riddles? What's up with her?""*

""Uhh... They're confidential?""

""Precisely. And to answer one your previous questions, they're here to prove a theory of mine.""

""What theory?""

""On your unhealthy obsession over classified documents."" - she answers without a break.

""I... don't follow.""

""Mhm, could you tell me the definition of the word 'classified'?""

""It's-""

My chest clamped with pain upon realization. The breath was gone, so was the heartbeat for a few moments, before my mind was flooded with curse words, playing the drone of pure and unfiltered terror, before silencing and eliciting only a singular:

*""Uh-oh.""*

""Something wrong, Doctor? You look rather pale... In any case, the word 'classified' means 'designated as officially secret and accessible only to authorized people'...""

The more she talked, the more I was enveloped in spine chilling dread. I thought I sorted this through, I thought it was behind me...

""Please do tell me, Doctor, who is, in your eyes, cleared for such documents?""

Kal'tsit was taunting me, torturing me, as I was unable to fight back. Every word I uttered felt out of place:

""I... Uhh... The uhhh..."" - *""These are not even words at all!""*

""The ones who can be trusted and whos influence with it will prove benificial"" - she answered for me - ""Now I wonder, where you've got your clearance...""

*""It's Badenough... It Cannot get worse than this...""*

""To think that you would incorporate one into your reviews...""

*""...Whar? Huh??""*

""Kal'tsit... Are you... talking about my reviews?""

""Of course I am.""

Like a mountain, stress fell off my shoulders, with a loud sigh of relief filling my helmet. *""Too close...""*

""Or are there any other official documents roaming around I should be aware of?""

""No, no, of course not! It's just... how is it related to my reviews if I made them up?""

""That's exactly the reason. I had at least a few members of the network coming and asking me where the combat reports were stored, or going beyond that and searching them by themselves. I can't help but suspect that they want to prove the validity and truthfulness of this particular review through tangent documents.""

*""Huh. Never thought about it...""*

""What's so compelling about including them anyway?""

""They serve as a nice epilogue since I can't coherently write one myself."" - *""Plus, it adds much-needed flair...""*

""Still, I'll ask you and your colleagues to refrain from putting anything resembling official papers into reviews in the future. I'm tired of sending Ansel to clean the informational mess after you. Is that clear?""

""Yes.""

My feet already started turning towards the door, to make an escape as soon as possible. However, it was too late:

""Now, while we're still at this topic...""

*""Uh-oh.""*

""We've been sent quite a few letters over the past week, and one of them was sent on behalf of the nation of Victoria...""

*""UH-OH.""*

""They are very displeased with the fact that you've revealed the internal characteristics of the steam knights on a forum dedicated to a video game titled ""Steam & Steel"" and they're seeking financial compensation in return.""

*""This... is so over... Wait-""*

""Who is the sender? **The** Victoria? **The** Vina Victoria? ***The*** speaker of the parliament Alexandrina Vina Victo-""

""You don't have to call her by full name."" - green glow blinked behind her - ""Yes, it's signed by her.""

""After everything we went through together? After the entirety of the Victoria arc? After *every LMD of promotions*?

""Doctor, her country is torn by war, and their economy is in shambles, your funds for promotions are equivalent to a drop in Seaborn waters - she'll take every bit of help they can get.""

""Should we - and can we, really - financially support **the entire country**?""

""**You** should, Rhodes Island stands aside from these ordeals, according to the details in the letter."" - her posture is very relaxed.

*""That's why she's so in the mood, it's my responsibility and mine alone... It's fine, I think I can deal with one legal dispute...""*

""We have also received similar complaints from Rhine Labs, Lateran Hall, several military corps from Kazimierz...""

""...""

""...and Senate of √Ügir. Multiple posts, multiple separate data leaks in one forum, all in your hopes of proving someone wrong.""

""Uh-oh...""

""You are not ""uh-oh""-ing out of this one, Doctor, this is an extremely serious and volatile matter. I had no idea you had your hands on so many of them, and I hope you understand the weight of the situation, since they might want to see you perso-""

1knierc,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1knierc/choose_your_boon/,Choose your boon,"You can have one minor boon from this list.  Only one, though.  No catch, I'm just feeling nice.

  
1. Your s\*\*\* doesn't stink.  Farts, too.  You can still have other unpleasant bodily odors, but your anus will not be contributing to them.  The worst you'd get would be, like, a faint musty odor if you drop a deuce and don't flush for a week or something.  (you still have to wash your hands after using the bathroom, though, it still has bacteria and such)

2. You can always find an easy parking spot.  It won't necessarily be the closest, but it will be easy to get into and out of, and if there's plenty of shade in the lot it will have at least a little shade.  Most of the time, if the lot has that kind of spot, you will be able to find a pull-through spot where you don't have to back up.  If there's a parking meter (of the appropriate kind), you will even find one with a couple of minutes left on the meter if you're just going in quickly for something (eg picking up an online order)

3. You can always get the water temperature right.  When you're washing your hands, filling a tub, taking a shower, or otherwise running water that is a mix of hot and cold, you will always find the perfect setting (or as close as your source can provide).  It's not a matter of infinite hot water or anything, and you still have the initial cold water that comes out (though it will have a shorter duration), but you will neither scald yourself (unless you're trying for that) nor be too cold.  You will just instinctively know how to perfectly adjust the knob(s).  The same goes for heating water in a microwave or on a stove (you just instinctively know how long on what setting you need).  Doesn't work for anything that isn't water (or heavily water-based beverages like coffee or tea), though.

4. Good dropping luck.  Whenever you drop or knock over something, it will always land with the best result you could easily expect.  Not perfect, if you drop something glass it will still usually break for example, but you won't have a huge shatter radius of tiny splinters.  Your toast will land butter side up.  You won't have to chase things that rolled under inaccessible furniture (eg the fridge).  Things will avoid splashing on anything hard to clean.  You won't drop that heavy or sharp thing on your bare toes.  That kind of thing.

5. They're not out.  When you go to a store for something specific (that they usually carry), there will always be at least one left.  It might be slightly dented or have a scratch or something (nothing that will render it nonfunctional), or it might be in the back, but as long as you are reasonably polite/friendly to the staff, they will be able to find it for you.  You still have to pay for it, and there may only be the one, but they will always have at least that one.  This includes, eg, that one fast food place that always seems to have their shake machine down for cleaning or whatever (""Oh, we only had enough shake mix left for one shake, so we poured it out a few minutes ago, here you go"")

  
Which do you pick, and why?  Any other thoughts?

Edit: 4 will not improve your dice rolls or anything like that, other than ensuring that your dice don't roll off the table and end up somewhere awkward.

Remembering dreams is hard, even though I‚Äôm usually not bad at remembering what i dream on a daily basis. It‚Äôs funny how i find it mentally challenging since it‚Äôs information that you‚Äôre brain is eager to erase, whereas usually we spend most of our days trying to absorb and acknowledge things.

Unfortunately getting back to work kicks in (i was on vacation) and with it i couldn‚Äôt keep up noting things. My wife usually sets up and audio book to fall asleep, so it‚Äôs hard for me to concentrate on trying to focus and remembering that i‚Äôm going to dream. I never achieved anything.

Yesterday i went out on a dinner with friends. Long story short, i got some late coffee as dessert (in France we call it ‚ÄúCaf√© Gourmand‚Äù). Big ‚Äúmistake‚Äù as it kept me quite up late, and in overall it made me wake up a lot (considering i‚Äôve been also trying to reduce my caffeine consumption). 

But when i woke up in the middle of a silent night, i remembered about lucid dreaming and went ‚Äúwhat the hell why not‚Äù. And i think it actually worked, for the first time ! I remember running (for sport) and slowly began to jump further and further, until i started to actually fly. First i levitate gently, but soon enough i was high above ground.

As i left earth, i started to question myself. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ am i dreaming ?‚Äù. I tried to look at my hands to do a reality check (something i usually never do despite being told useful). They were blurry, but slowly got normal.

After that i think i got too excited and woke up. It only lasted a few seconds, and i spent the whole day totally wasted and tired, but this unexpected event gave me some hope to continue on this long & difficult journey. ",1,1747340267.0,LucidDreaming,2,1.0,False

1kni5te,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1kni5te/an_aeropress_disaster_risk_analysis_the_inverted/,An Aeropress ‚ÄúDisaster‚Äù Risk Analysis: The Inverted Method,"https://preview.redd.it/rpvqs1lt601f1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5778e16baf0314f475a1362ea437ac1b8f127e2

It finally happened to us (35M, 33F). After using the inverted method exclusively since August 16, 2023 (638 calendar days), a coffee cataclysm befell us.

**\*\*The Facts:\*\***

As the Aeropress sat on the counter in the ‚Äúinverted‚Äù position, the woman was observed overfilling the device to the brim with hot water. This error resulted in insufficient space to properly seat the cap and paper filter. To attempt to resolve the issue, the brewer braced the bottom of the plunger (what would be the \*top\* in the traditional brewing method) against the countertop, and slowly pulled the chamber upward, effectively increasing the volumetric capacity of the chamber. At this point, the plunger came fully out of the chamber and spilled its contents violently onto the countertop and floor. Fortunately, the brewer was able to move her hands/body quickly enough to escape scalding, and no observers were in the path of the tidal wave.

**\*\*The Analysis:\*\***

In debriefing the incident, the brewer and observers (35M and 9 y/o Canine) agreed that the overfilling and subsequent correction attempt amounted to ‚Äúimproper use.‚Äù In a full-scope review of the brewer‚Äôs technique, everyone agreed that no other potential ‚Äúimproper use‚Äù techniques exist that would affect the safety or quality of the brewing process. The male observer‚Äôs brewing technique was also reviewed, and no potential errors were identified. Although the dog is not known to brew coffee, her opinion on quality/taste was relevant, as she surreptitiously drinks unattended coffees whenever the opportunity arises.

When further questioned about the observed improper technique, the brewer admitted to utilizing it with some frequency and success in the past. She could not estimate a precise frequency at first, but after some discussion agreed to an estimate of one in ten brewing attempts (10%). It was confirmed that this was the household‚Äôs first ‚Äúdisaster.‚Äù

When measuring effectiveness and failure rates, it is critical to incorporate rates of improper use, as researchers do when measuring the effectiveness of condoms, the pill, and other forms of contraception. While our situation is only a single case study, there is a large enough sample of brewing attempts to provide baselines for inverted method failure rates with proper and improper use.

The household‚Äôs total brewing attempts are estimated at 3.5 attempts per day \* 638 days = 2233 attempts, inclusive of both brewers.¬†

Incorporating coffee drinking habits, the 35M brewer accounts for 1.5 attempts per day (957 attempts; 42.8% of all attempts). The 33F brewer accounts for 2 attempts per day (1276 attempts; 57.1% of all attempts).¬†

Improper uses were estimated at 1276 attempts \* 0.1 = 128 improper uses.

**\*\*Findings/Conclusion:\*\***

This case study found that the inverted method is quite safe with proper use, with a 100% safety rate.¬†

With improper use, the inverted method resulted in disaster 0.8% of the time ‚Äî a 99.2% safety rate.

**\*\*Limitations, Discussion, and Disclosures:\*\***

More research is necessary to identify disaster rates with proper use, which are assumed to be nonzero in accordance with Murphy‚Äôs Law. The study‚Äôs 100% safety rate for proper use should be interpreted with scrutiny.

Improper use also requires more research, as the current study does not account for variability in meta-technique across inverted method brewers. Further, the current study suggests that discrete ‚Äúimproper use‚Äù techniques may not be identified until a disaster occurs. Thus, all data must be based upon brewers‚Äô memory and retroactive estimation under the current study design.¬†

Even if a disaster has not yet occurred in a particular Aeropress household, all inverted method brewers could benefit from a full-scope technique review, including at least one brewer-observer tasked with scrutinizing the safety of the test brewer‚Äôs inverted method meta-technique. Any identified potential improper use techniques should be added to the research base for further review and discussion.

This seems like an extreme amount of coffee for what we are actually getting out of this coffee maker. 

At this point, getting coffee at the coffee shop would be the same price. Is there a way to still get a great cup of coffee while conserving the amount of coffee per brew? ",0,1747340014.0,pourover,31,0.47,False

Hey everyone, I‚Äôm Harry ‚Äì 25, gay, girly guy, born and raised in Detroit . Lately, I‚Äôve been feeling the weight of loneliness hit a little differently. Not just the ‚ÄúI have no one to text‚Äù kind, but that deeper kind where you really crave a connection ‚Äî someone to share thoughts with, someone who gets you, someone who stays.

I‚Äôm not here looking for anything romantic or inappropriate. What I genuinely need is a best friend. A platonic soul bond. A safe space where we can just be ourselves without judgment. I want to be that friend who listens to your 3AM rants about life, who hypes you up when you‚Äôre feeling low, who checks in when the world feels too heavy ‚Äî because I know how much that matters.

I know there are people out there going through tough times ‚Äî breakups, emotional stress, identity struggles, or just a general sense of being misunderstood. If that‚Äôs you, I‚Äôd love to talk. I‚Äôm a great listener, and honestly, I‚Äôd be honored to hold space for someone who just wants to feel heard and seen.

A bit about me:

I‚Äôm very in touch with my feminine side, and I‚Äôm proud of it. I love fashion, cozy aesthetics, deep conversations, and expressing emotion freely.

I‚Äôve had a bestie before who meant the world to me ‚Äî we used to talk for hours, share fashion advice, vent, laugh over memes, even help each other pick outfits (yes, even lingerie for her dates haha).

I love voice chats more than texts ‚Äî it feels so much more real, expressive, and connected. But I‚Äôll vibe with long texts too if you‚Äôre more comfortable that way.

Movies, journaling, astrology, music, and chaotic 2AM thoughts are my jam.

I‚Äôm loyal, emotionally available, and always rooting for the people I care about.


If you‚Äôre looking for a friend who will actually care, remember your favorite coffee order, remind you that you matter, and never make you feel like ‚Äútoo much‚Äù ‚Äî then I think we‚Äôd get along just fine.

I don‚Äôt care where you‚Äôre from, what gender you are, or what you‚Äôre going through. If you need a friend, or even just someone to talk to without pressure, message me. Let‚Äôs vibe, grow, and maybe build something beautiful out of this weird online universe.

Sending love,
