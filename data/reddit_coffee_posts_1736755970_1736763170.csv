Interestingly, there was a stronger association between early coffee use and a decreased risk of mortality than there was with later consumption of coffee. This emphasizes the significance of intake time when assessing how coffee consumption and health consequences are related.

I’ve even had urges to do something destructive, like deleting his business social media or sharing a journal entry he wrote about his female best friend, even though I know those things wouldn’t help. I feel like I’m spiraling, overwhelmed by abandonment and betrayal, and I don’t know how to handle [it.My](http://it.My) ex said he wanted “space” when we broke up, but then he went on a holiday with his female best friend—the same friend he once admitted having feelings for. Before I came along, people in the community even thought they were a couple because they spent so much time together, though they always denied it. During our relationship, he continued spending significant time with her, doing things like Pilates, saunas, coffee and dinner dates, and even wine and movie nights at her house. She even invited herself to my birthday dinner. I discovered a journal entry where he had wrote about his strong feelings and love for her about 2 months before he and I started dating. The journal entry was discovered by accident. At the beginning of our relationship, he seemed so into me—pursuing me and acting infatuated—but over time, I felt like I was being used for sex while he leaned on her emotionally. When I expressed discomfort about their dynamic and tried to set boundaries, he dismissed my concerns. There were moments when I ended things because their connection was hurting me, and he would cry and beg me to stay, so we’d try again. But nothing ever changed. In the end, he said our on-and-off dynamic was too exhausting, admitted he was confused, and decided he couldn’t commit to me because he had too much going on in his life, needed space, and needed to find his own happiness. Despite saying he wanted “space,” he’s now spending all his time with her after we broke up. Now, I feel consumed by anger about how he mistreated me and disrespected my feelings. It feels like betrayal. I hate that I’m spending so much mental energy on him and her, but I can’t stop ruminating about everything. I feel like I’ll never get the apology or closure I need, and I don’t know how to move forward. How do you process feelings of anger and betrayal when someone treats you badly? How do you let go of the hope for acknowledgment or an apology and stop wasting energy on someone who doesn’t deserve it?",1,1736762643.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1i0aqme,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1i0aqme/ndad_with_ocd_i_cant_take_it_anymore_21f/,"NDad with OCD, i can’t take it anymore (21F)","my relationship with my dad has truly ruined my life and i’m worried if i don’t act soon on leaving i will be fucked. i just can’t imagine leaving my mom who has been a victim of narcissistic and financial abuse from her mother and my dad. he married her when she was 17 and he was 30, and he already had a kid and they moved from the middle east to canada. she never got a chance to get a uni degree or build a career and still works in retail at 42, she basically has nothing more then 4k saved because my dad always takes her money when she finally saves it. anyways, my younger sister is starting to show really violent responses and behavior (17F) and whenever i try to point out how she can be extremely aggressive she loses it. i just feel like i need to make note of this. 

i’m not sure if this is accurate but i believe my father has OCD (his obsessive thought is me being harmed and his compulsion is constantly “preparing” me, i.e. telling me about every street that has a bump or left turn before i left the house, remind me 100 times about something stupid like wearing socks, he always has to text me to ask what i’m doing and requires me to explain where i am going and with who and how long) I am 21 BTW and graduating university in 3 months, applying for my PhD. 

my thinking right now is that he is used to always getting his compulsions satisfied because he becomes violent when they are not, and i think it manifested in him being a narc. is that possible? 

he fully expects me to live my life as if i also have obsessive thoughts about safety. he was also raised during the worst wars in the middle east so i understand he has severe trauma of people leaving the home and never coming back. but my life is beginning and i don’t wanna get married anytime soon, the only way he will have his compulsive thoughts rested for me to move out is if i get married (cause apparently rushing into a marriage will make me safer then relying on myself). 
whenever i tell him about my plans or ask him if he can give me a ride he always says no immediately and will find some characteristic of my plan to be dangerous. i constantly have to prove to him like he’s a lawyer that im going to be safe. it could be getting coffee in the winter past 4:30pm, he tells me to be home by dark (which is 4:20 in december in canada). he makes me feel embarrassed to even try to have deep friendships, i lost all my closest friends in uni because of the way i couldn’t show up for them, im so embarrassed about how he controls me.

how that my graduation is coming up, i want to travel and maybe even move out. but i feel like im gonna throw up, i cry every time i think of telling my father im leaving. my family relies heavily on me, even when they don’t mean to. since i was 6 and my dad would take the money i saved my allowance to pay for bills for now at 21 my dad randomly asking me for 3k for bills. and i always give it, i am the only one who actually helps with the harder chores for my mom (my dad only vaccums my sister only does dishes when me and my mom aren’t home). i do the whole families laundry, i always pay for my sisters clothes or things she needs, im the first they fall to when they need stability. i know when i move out i will be forced NC, my dad knows that i would die if i lost contact with my mom, and he would force me to not talk to her. 
i know my mom wouldn’t let it happen, she always encourages me to move out. she never told me no to any of my dreams or goals. she always tears up when she sees how much i accomplished at 21 all alone. she says im her feather and i never weighed her down or burdened her, even though i am in my thesis, work two jobs, and am a full time student. 

please someone tell me how i can fix how i feel/ prepare myself to be strong enough for when this day comes. for some reason i feel like my mom is the glue of the family but the only way she can handle it is because she has me. how do i even handle these emotions  and anxiety. please tell me how do i learn to adjust to OCD and Narc parents. 🙏🏼",1,1736762553.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I am F28, been a normal right in the middle of my healthy weight range my whole life, I never had a penchant for junk food , but I may have a brownie maybe once a week. 
My colleague who was overweight and is now almost underweight after a strict diet and exercise regimen, now is very vocal about what i eat. 
In my attempt to cut off lattes I got today a light cocoa drink ( 40 cals) as my morning beverage and she looked at it and said it is “ passable” . I don’t think there id a hot drink with less except for black coffee and I hate coffee . I don’t drink it at all. I can do Lattes because of the milk. 

I thought 40 was good? Especially since my breakfast was 2 boiled eggs no bread no any other addition which is also good. And the fact that I do walk a bit to get around to work . 
Anyways, a few minutes after I was unpacking my lunch to put it in the fridge and she also had something to say about it. That this is too little to fill me up. 
And whenever I have something not in the lowcal category even if I don’t manage to finish the plate and she does ( happened 2 weeks ago at a restaurant, where we both got the same dish , she ate it all and it was HUGE full of pasta and cheese and couldn’t eat 1/4 of it)
She proudly states she can eat it all but no one argues with her that it is too much because she is near her underweight range now. 

Yet she would have an aversion of me chewing a gum cz it is 11 cals .
It started to become super annoying. Actually today is the first day that I’m planning to have lunch, i have been skipping meals for a while now because I don’t feel comfortable eating around her in lunch break , and I don’t look slender enough to get a “ pass” .
I picked up rope jumping in September and i didn’t like it but did it anyways to give myself an excuse even though I don’t really eat a lot or eat unhealthily , and eat out once every 2-3 months.  

I really don’t want this life for myself. I overthink everything and food is not something I’d like to overthink and become miserable about. I have no joy in life , and not seeking to have one, i just want during my break to empty my thoughts rather than stress more or else i ‘d rather work in my break. ",1,1736762236.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Eventually, I stopped initiating, and the connection fizzled out. Work sometimes feels like high school, where you have to be part of the “in” crowd to truly connect. I recognize that some of this stems from my past—growing up with a distant father who hasn’t been in touch since I was 10, and a mom who doesn’t ask much about me, focusing more on herself.

Hello everyone! 😊  

I’m a F(27) recently moved to Riyadh and, while I'm really enjoying the city, I'm finding it a bit hard to make new friends. One of the challenges I'm facing is that I don't speak Arabic, which makes it a little tricky to connect with people and find communities.  

I’m hoping to meet some new friends, especially other *expats* or *females* who might also be in a similar situation. Are there any suggestions for groups or activities where I can meet people, practice my Arabic, or just have a fun time getting to know others?  

I already tried meetup (the app) but it didn’t work for me.

If anyone knows of any *female social groups* or *expat meetups* in Riyadh, that would be amazing! I'm open to trying different activities, whether it’s fitness, coffee meetups, cultural events, or anything else that might help me connect with others.  

I wanna point out I’m only just interested in friendships with females, not the opposite gender.

For almost two weeks now, I've been trying to avoid not only single-use plastic but also the accidental consumption of microplastics, and I would be lying if I didn’t admit that every day I’ve thought about quitting the experiment. Three areas of plastic-free living have become so much more difficult that it almost feels like a full-time job. Please bear in mind as you read that I’ve kept many aspects of my life from last year: from plastic-free sunscreen to a metal safety razor, from food containers made of metal and glass to the habit of bringing my own steel cup to drink coffee in, I’ve had a head start. Here are the areas that were completely new to me:

1. **Clothing without synthetic fibers** – the area where a person typically ingests the most particles through abrasion. By far the worst area, and the one where I’m most likely to give in. It was to be expected that the most unexpected clothing items have exactly 2 percent elastane, and therefore, I can't wear them. It still drives me crazy every time. After finding enough plastic-free pants, sweaters, shirts, blouses, and shoes with natural rubber soles, daily clothing hasn’t been a problem. The nightmare begins when you realize that there is no natural fiber warm enough for a decent winter jacket *and* that keeps the warmth in wet conditions. So far, I've been wearing a shearling jacket made of lambskin every day, but it suffers from the fact that even light drizzle causes the fur to lose its loft. As a result, I’m constantly freezing, and going outside in the rain is just a dream. That I look like a confused scrap dealer 4 out of 5 days is simply something I have to accept. Far worse is the area of sports: I’ve almost gotten used to chafing from thick cotton fabric, and that’s after having to sew my own shorts because I couldn’t find any made from natural fibers that weren’t yoga pants (which are unsuitable for things like rowing). I can't even cycle because cycling shorts – well, you know. For another column, I had to do sports outdoors for several hours in zero degrees without a jacket. For older people or those with health issues, this aspect would simply be impossible.**Top tips**: a) The Converse basic model is made of 100% natural material! b) Invest in an Aran-sweater to keep you warm during winter. c) COS has a wide variety of clothes made from organic cotton without having to trade the ecological aspect for stylishness. Basic tees only cost about 20is Euros.
2. As already mentioned, I can hardly use any of my regular kitchen appliances, which was still allowed in the last experiment since, for example, the water tank of my espresso machine isn’t disposable plastic. Luckily, I've found replacements for everything in my home, but the Plastic-Free Shop is no longer an option, because the containers used to store nuts, seeds, and similar products are made of plastic. So, my diet mainly consists of fruits and vegetables from the farm (Adamah), meat from the butcher that wasn’t vacuum-sealed (beef), eggs, and a few carbohydrates stored in paper (certain types of rice, polenta, flour), as well as yogurt and homemade cheese. Nuts need to be cracked by hand, but with a little experience, everything is quite manageable. Caution is required when ordering: For example, pizza is delivered in a cardboard box, but you have to order marinara because the mozzarella is stored in plastic. It's better to order coffee black (I've already forgotten to do this twice) because milk at Starbucks comes in a tetrapack, etc., etc. The big paradox of this area is that the ecological aspect of better storage and shelf life is proportional to the amount of plastic: I can now buy fewer organic products because additives are needed to make them shelf-stable without plastic.**Top tips**: a) Find a coffeeshop where the espresso machine is directly connected to the tap and buy a used Bialetti for at home use, which is a great buy for life item as well. b) Start by buying one pan and one spatula made of steel. WMF is a good European brand, also a buy for life. c) Find a brand for every basic carb you eat, that sells said carb in paper. One brand for rice, one for polenta, one for oatmeal etc. and buy in bulk. Learn one new skill like like breadmaking.
3. **Home textiles**: Fortunately, almost everything we have is made of natural fibers, as we happened to buy wool rugs in Tunisia and my sofa is made of leather. Additionally, my obsession with buying bed linen sets and pillowcases from Grüne Erde last year helped me start on a good level. However, the ribbons of my medals, plant saucers, and various small decorative items have to be stored away for the duration of the experiment.**Top tip**: a) Small items: Leather, leather, leather – buy it little by little for a lifetime. Replace your purse, wallet, notebook and eventually your couch. b) Big textiles: If you are ever on vacation in a northern African country, buy woolen rags, like there is no tomorrow. With 200 Euros you can replace all carpets in your home. If that is not an option use oriental-style cotton rags from Ikea: [https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/roerkaer-teppich-flach-gewebt-schwarz-natur-70418778/](https://www.ikea.com/at/de/p/roerkaer-teppich-flach-gewebt-schwarz-natur-70418778/) c) Learn to darn small holes so every textile becomes a buy for life.

In summary, this experiment is so impractical that the health benefits don’t justify the effort it takes. It will certainly be a lesson in how dependent our society is on plastic, and a reminder of the fact that we consume the equivalent of a credit card every week. But the reassuring conclusion ""it’s really easy if you just try"" will not be forthcoming. It’s an absolute ordeal, and every day without plastics is tedious. Unlike the political ban on single-use plastics, I believe there are no real replacements for many things. I still hope my tips help a bit to at least start the habit!",2,1736761548.0,PlasticFreeLiving,0,1.0,False

At first, I tried many specialty coffees (every blend rave coffee sells in the uk and a few single origins) and had a hard time despite spending many hours reading everything I could find and watching every Hoffman video on espresso technique. Then, I switched to lavazza beans and all the problems are gone. 18.5g in, 37g out in 25-30 seconds, 0 channeling (I have a naked portafilter). I've pretty much tried their entire range at this point and was able to get great shots with pretty much all of them, though I've stuck to oro (great for flat white) / supercrema (great for latte) for the most part.

The conclusion I reached was that

1. Lavazza blends are darker than anything Rave sells, and darker roasts are probably easier to deal with overall
2. Lavazza blends need no degassing on arrival, whereas Rave blends are often roasted the day before they arrive at my door, and I was not waiting 1 week or more as I've since found out is recommended (why does nobody mention this on beginner videos?).

So 2 years into having the machine, I've decided to give specialty coffee a go again, thinking I knew better. But no, same problems as the first time. Basically, for an 18.5g dose, there is no good grind setting that doesn't choke the machine. If I find coarse enough for something to come out (I use 4 for lavazza but need 8-10 for rave blends), it starts to channel almost immediately and the flow starts to increase through the shot until by the end it's just fast channels everywhere. And why am I grinding coarser for lighter roasts anyway?

Now, I seem to have found a workaround, which is to dramatically decrease the dosage from 18.5g to 16g, at which point I can actually grind at 4 like with the lavazza beans and get a decent shot. Mind you, this is with their ""Strong AF"" beans, which are actually the darkest they sell. I'm now imagining I'll have to decrease this even further for the medium roasts if I'm supposed to grind even finer, let alone light roasts.

I can find a few forum posts of people mentioning lower doses can fix problems with these machines, but why? Others seem to have no issues. Is it possible my machine is actually not producing enough pressure?",1,1736761461.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

‼️ JUST TODAY I WAVERED BUT MY LUCKY GIRL SYNDROME MANIFESTED IN THAT SAME DAY. ‼️

One time I showed up to school in a P.E uniform since, again, there were no academic classes and we were all focusing on a big school event until the end of the month. (more details in my SP success story😝😝) 
I saw everyone and all of them had the school uniform. Turns out I was the only one with the jogging pants, sneakers and T-shirt because we were supposed to be filmed singing the national anthem. 
I d1ed de4d because I was one of like 5 people out of thousands that did not wear school uniform. I felt so uneasy that I just hid in the restroom stall and waited for it to be done, feeling more uneasy for deducted points and stupidity. 

I felt more uneasy that they kept repeating and had rounds and re-takes for perfection-.. Okay that sounds so negative but I was just standing against the wall with my hand against my chest and my eyes closed telling myself that it was okay because I HAD MY BACK AT LEAST 💪💪 
After that, people were entering the restroom to change and that was when I went out. I somehow asked two people if they bought their PE uniforms and they got dumbfounded..? (if that's the right word) because they did not know they were supposed to bring it. It made me feel SLIGHTLY much better and I went out the restroom to see one of my best friends and I humoured how I was the only one with jogging pants on. 

I FELT SEVERELY UNLUCKY ‼️

Then she went on to tell me that I was actually the luckiest girl in the world (everyday.) because since I showed up in jogging pants, I got to skip the whole recording + a dance they had to go through multiple times and I got to wear something comfortable throughout clubbings and dance practice. She didn't bring anything. 
Turns out my whole grade did not know that we were supposed to bring jogging pants. I was the only one with jogging pants and people were calling me LUCKY. even better, someone mistakened me for a higher grade and so gave me a snack for free that was only exclusive for their grade. Lucky girl syndrome at its FINEST.

Sometimes, good luck can look a lot like bad luck. You being late from work from a spilled cup of coffee could've saved you from a car crash. The elevator you couldn't get on could've prevented you from getting stuck on it. You crashing into someone could make you find your best friend of 20 years or your lifetime soulmate. Never mistaken ANYTHINGG for just bad luck. 

And wavering? It's probably just your mind getting challenged by new life concepts that stretch your rubber band of consciousness. Someone who is not used to financial abundance will doubt the introduction to effortless success that passes by their reality. Never waver, but if you do then you're still going through evolution which is like so amazing.

Tried a Sonos move but it was just to similar to our UE Boom 2 box. We want to be emersed by music, we thought about additional over ear headphones if the speakers won't be sufficient for our needs.

We only stream music through spotify until now, but of we can hear the difference we may go for tidal or other high quality streaming services. We have not got any CD's or other media we'd want to use.

If possible we'd like being able to multiroom in the future with additional smart speakers.

I just want to know what a good approach could be, just correct me if I made wrong assumptions:

1. Buy an used amp (e.g. 2.1) for cheap, if that's not possible go for a AV-Receiver
2. Buy a streamer like the WiiM mini or if no Amp could be found the WiiM Amp (if no used amp could be found for <100€)
3. Buy used speakers, but im not sure what to go for (especially regarding quality in the past and if modern speakers arent already better though cheaper yet?)
4. Connect and enjoy.

I'd be thankful for some advice 🙌

1i0adb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1i0adb4/back_to_bothering_paper_again/,Back to bothering paper again.,"I’m Anik , a writer, poet, and playwright (basically a professional daydreamer who occasionally puts words together in a way that sounds smart). My life revolves around literature, theology, and philosophy because apparently, I thought, Why not overthink everything while also sounding pretentious? Spoiler alert: it’s both rewarding and exhausting. My brain is powered by a potent mix of ideas, existential crises, and just enough caffeine to keep me teetering on the edge of enlightenment - or a nervous breakdown, depending on the day.

I’ve been scribbling letters since I was six , mostly to my grandmother, bless her patience, and occasionally attempting to send her postcards… without stamps, naturally. (Turns out, the postal service doesn’t appreciate my creativity.) Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of forging some amazing connections, most of which I’ve had to let go. Not for dramatic reasons, mind you - just your garden-variety “it’s not you, it’s me” scenarios.

Lately, I’ve been toying with the idea of picking up the pen again, but procrastination is my middle name. Today, however, I finally decided to make good on that thought.I’m absolutely thrilled to meet you, well, not “meet” in the literal sense because, you know, letters...but close enough! And if you feel inspired to write back, I’ll be so grateful I might even send you a postcard. Don’t worry, this time I’ll remember the stamp. Probably.

When I’m not passionately arguing with myself about the meaning of life (or why tea will forever outclass coffee), you’ll find me in the kitchen, experimenting like a mad scientist who traded test tubes for spatulas. Sometimes it’s a culinary masterpiece; other times, even my dog looks concerned.

Rainy days are my love language. Give me a cup of tea, a slightly obscure book that makes me question my existence, and the sound of raindrops, and I’m in heaven. Bonus points if I can curl up in a blanket and pretend the outside world doesn’t exist. Bliss. But don’t worry, I’m not just a brooding intellectual; I’m also surprisingly fun. Like, “philosophical debates over pizza and bad puns” kind of fun.

I’m all about connecting with people, especially those who can tolerate my quirky humor and occasional deep dives into why we’re all here (or why pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity). Fair warning: I laugh way too hard at my own jokes and will absolutely judge your food seasoning skills.

In a nutshell, I’m equal parts thinker and clown, with a dash of culinary chaos. My DMs are open, so slide in like a confident penguin on ice. I promise I won’t bite , unless you offer me unseasoned food or subject me to Dad jokes gone wrong.

1i0aac3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1i0aac3/ky_work_place_discrimination_wrongful_termination/,[KY] Work place discrimination & Wrongful termination? ,"Hello there, I (26f) was recently terminated by an employer and I feel as if it may be because I am a female. 
Yes, I know Kentucky is an ""at will"" state but there are laws that protect employees federally and by state (Kentucky in my situation)
I will start out by saying this employer has less than 15 female employees out of 113. I started employment 11/12/24, started actually driving for the company on 11/25/2024 and was terminated 12/14/2024. This job is a package delivery service so I drove a company vehicle and used a company work cell phone for my job. 

When I was doing my interview, the male manager-Simon as referenced below-  asked me some questions, and then awkwardly followed up with that they have ""2 handfuls or so"" of women who work for the company due to them not being cut out for the job. I thought this was an odd statement but proceeded, as their HR is a woman so I figured it couldn't have been to weird of a comment.
 My first day on the job i took a 26 minute lunch break to use the bathroom and take care of *womanly* needs as I have PCOS. I was promptly called at around the 25 minute mark and told that I needed to get back on the road now. I explained that I was using the restroom, and as a woman I have to be able to stop and take a break. After I arrived back to the station, I was then told I can't take a break for the first 5 hours of my shift. I expressed again, in front of many other -male- employees that as a female who menstruates, I must have a break. He seemed annoyed and just said ok. I then contacted HR regarding the issue, and she said that I'm allowed to take a break 1 delievery into my shift if I want, and that she will correct him. I was guided by male employees to use a coffee cup or carry a hospital type of urine jug given to makes. I started using coffee cups especially in very rural areas as the closest establishment was 30-45 minutes away.
After this, dispatch stopped calling me as much and I was able to work on my own pace while also finishing my routes in a timely manner for someone who was newly employed. A week or so goes by, and we had rain and then a few days of below freezing and the roads -especially in very rural areas- were in poor condition. The company vehicle i was assigned had a very bald tire on the driver front side. Concerned for others safety and my own, I pulled the owner aside and let him know my tire was bad. He told me to pull back in after load up and he would put a tire on. I call dispatch once I'm loaded up in the parking lot and was told there were no tires available and to ""run it."" I expressed that my company vehicle would not be leaving the parking lot unless my tire is changed. 2 male employees came outside to change my tire after a 10-15 minute wait. One was my manager (Let's call him Simon) and the other person was a dispatcher (let's call him Roger). I stood there awkwardly as Roger felt the need to remind me to ""stay away from the vehicle so I don't get hurt"" while he changed a tire? Simon then came into the picture and expressed that ""he doesn't have time for this, when you run everything you got 24/7 and you don't have the luxury of time to fix something minor."" This comment floored me. I told him ""Sometimes you just have to make time, as I care about my life more than any package inside of the vehicle."" I got a lot of eye rolls from both of them. Simon left, leaving me with Roger. Roger then made the comment that the tire still had ""500-600 miles"" left on it. I replied, ""it should have been changed 500-600 miles ago, you mean."" I recorded this conversation and KY laws allow me to do this without approval from other persons involved. 
Since that instance of having them change my tire, Roger, who is lead dispatch, would call me more frequently with the sole purpose to ""hurry up"" and tell me ""I'm behind"" and that ""I don't have help to send you."" Basically phone calls that served no purpose. Before every phone call, regardless if I had service on the provided phone, I was asked my stop and location. In training, we were shown how dispatch watches us. This information is generally something they can look up on their own, as it's part of their job description. I can understand once or twice, but this became an every day instance. There were instances were I was given conflicted information from dispatch. An example would be to come back to the station no later than 7pm, but when I confirm that as I'm 1 hour away from the station, that I need to head toward the station around 6. I was then told no, I need to finish my route. I explained I can try, but if I can't, do I leave at 6 to get there by 7. My question was left unanswered but I did my best and got my route finished and was coming into the station around 7:15. I was then praised by Roger -it seemed sarcastic to be honest- because I finished my shift and made it back in a reasonable time.
 the day after I had a huge load (163 stops and over +260 packages) and I spoke to the owner about receiving help. He agreed to send me help as the load was huge even by his standards. I then prepared for my route, done load up and went to head out, but the work phone refused to gps or allow me to go to offline maps. It showed that I had confirmed I picked up my load, but as I changed company phones in the parking lot with my other manager -lets call him Josh- and he confirms my issues. It proceeded to tell me that I did not load up my route, and going back to do this is stressful as these codes are located in carts and there are hundreds of them. I then had to seek help to remake these codes so I can scan them so I can start my route. It took about 45 minutes. I expressed to my manager Josh that ""I feel like I'm gonna cry! Of course I get a big route and end up having issues first thing!"" He said ""there's no need to cry."" I explained it was just expression, as I'm not going to actually cry I was just being dramatic about my soon to be spiral of a shift due to such a long set back. My vehicle is so full at this point, any time I move something shifts and falls. I had to take extra time to organize every time I had to get a larger packages due to having no space. Within 1.5 hours I managed to get 35 delievery locations which is pretty good considering I've only been driving for them for 3 weeks. I was called by dispatch who was none other than Simon of course. It was the usual bull crap of ""what stop"" and ""where are you"" just to be told ""you're 12 behind, you need to step it up."" I immediately started recording the conversation. I expressed that being only 12 behind, due to the set back i had that morning, was pretty good despite i was nearly 45 minutes behind on start this morning. He never asked me why or what occured. He replied with ""I don't have much help to send out so I need you to step it up."" I expressed that I am going as fast as I can, and they will just have to send me help. I was audibly shaken up during this interaction. He replied, ""no, no"" and then I just explained the issues I had that morning, the conversation I had with the owner, and how I felt this phone call was harassment as it doesn't have a purpose other than to create stress for me on the road. He hangs up on me, so I continue to work. I ended up getting a call 30 minutes later telling me to come back. I cried the whole way back. I just knew I was getting fired, as I said the word harassment and I'm a woman so they immediately saw me as a threat. I walked in and was met half way into the building by Roger, who was being followed by Simon and Josh who both had smirks on their faces. They walked me outside where it was a little louder. Simon and Josh stood to the left and kind of behind me, not saying a single word to me. Roger then proceeded to tell me that ""some people just aren't cut out for the job"" and I explained to him why I'm a perfect fit for this job, like referring to him praising me the night before for my good work, customer reviews and my weekly delievery package totals. He rolls his eyes at me and smirks and said ""this is where we part ways."" I told him thats all I needed to know and I proceeded to walk back to the company vehicle to retrieve my personal belongings and was instructed to turn in my uniform when ever I could. To say I felt intimidated as there is no reason 3 men needed to fire me over ""not being cut out for the job."" I recorded him firing me as well, so that if any changes to why I was fired occured, I had it on record for legal reasons. I contacted HR and was told she would call me. I was then told the owner has decided to take my call and would give me a call. I waited a week and 2 days and no response. I ended up reporting to the company they deliever for, and I was immediately called the next day that happened to be Christmas Eve- 12/24/2024. The owner obviously only contacted me because I put in the complaint. He explained that Roger didn't have the authority to terminate me, and the repeated unnecessary phone calls was part of his idea to ""motivate"" the drivers to ""stay in the green."" He confirmed with me that the termination paperwork has not been filed, I still have a job and I would be contacted after Christmas by Josh for scheduling, and my absence from work for a week and a half was completely due to miscommunication on behalf of the employer. I was never contacted. I then sent another text on Dec. 31, 2024 to the owner with no reply to my message that stated ""I'm not sure if you know or not, but I can see my schedule being taken out weekly and I still haven't been contacted by Josh."" 3 days later I was paid out my PTO and completely terminated from the company. They also barred me from accessing ADP, even taking my ability to see my w2 away after I signed up to go paperless. Now I will have to fight to get a copy of my w2. This felt purely intentional due to the timing of the situation of me texting the owner. I was terminated with the same paperwork that I was told was invalid as my contract stated it would be a break in contract. Given, I had been having open communication with HR during this time collecting my pay stubs, express my issues about the miscommunication and she even sent me a copy of my termination paperwork that has ""Internal use only"" written on the top.  The termination paperwork was filled from top to bottom about how I was aggressive to dispatch and that I was given multiple changes to correct it but ultimately did not that resulted in my termination. I do not have any write ups or verbal warnings/acknowledgements, as HR confirmed this as I asked for any other documentation to support the termination letter. I was surprised at this as my recording of the reason I was given vocally was completely different. HR expressed that she is but a meer messagener who files the paperwork she is told to file. 
I decided to report to the funding company again about the issue, to be told that it's out of their jurisdiction. I made a comment of ""well now I know who to take legal action against."" 3 hours later I get a text from HR telling me to check my email. I received an reinstatement of employment letter that was effective immediately on Jan. 10 2025. 
I was told that my termination was purely accidental and that's why it was reinstated immediately (it was not immediately, it was a week later. It was immediately after I reported them to their funding company.)  I expressed my concerned about lost wages and their reply is ""in the contract you signed with us, it says we can change your hours based on business needs "" I then pointed out that this was the busiest season of the year and everyone was getting over time and I was not offered a schedule at all. They tried to use bland HR copy and paste paragraphs to dispute my concerns. I told them I had recorded and documented a lot of information, and I know that I'm at least owed unemployment due to them expressing i was without a schedule due to a big miscommunication. I've been speaking with HR regarding my reinstatement letter as I have yet to accept it unless we can come to terms about payment for my missed time. They keep trying to say that their contract covers all of my concerns and it's all at their discretion. HR also had the audacity to say ""We have plenty of employees who can do 180+ stops in a day and be done by 5pm"" I pointed out the contract stated that I had a 90 day probation period to reach the 180+ stop Mark and I have only been driving for less than a 3 weeks so it's unfair to judge me or compare me with others who have worked past the 90 days. I had been told by Roger and Josh that I'm faster at the job than my husband on multiple occasions, who also works for the same company. I also want to make note that I had spoken to other female employees (most female employees always wear make up and I would consider fit and have a better appearance as me) who say they never get calls and they stop for breakfast and coffee every morning and never get told to hurry up. I spoke to male employees who stated that the employer will test me as I'm a woman and not many stay due to their expectations that are not stated in policy and are usually gross, like using the restroom in the back of a company vehicle into a coffee cup. I was also told by male employees that I will get fired if I report unsafe work equipment to the funding company as they have a strict policy regarding faulty equipment. That was confirmed as I was told on multiple instances, sometimes days in a row, not to put it on either of my inspections we're required to fill out before and after each shift. 
This is still an on going issue, and I apologize if I rambled on. I'm a mom of a 3 year old and between the stress of looking for another job after Christmas -which is impossible it seems- and the mess that this situation has become, I'm left mentally exhausted and low in confidence. There is a lot more to the current place in at in this situation as I'm currently trying to negotiate with the business as I do not want to have to sue. 
I really just need others opinions in this situation as I am not educated in the law so I want to be more confident in my decisions and negotiations with this employer. 
Thank you for taking the time to read, I truly appreciate it. I look forward to any information/advice/questions on this matter. ",1,1736760512.0,AskLawyers,0,1.0,False

Hey MaximizeMe Fam!

Ever feel like success is that mythical unicorn we're all chasing—just when you think you've got it, it gallops off laughing at you? 🦄 Well, spoiler alert: success isn’t a finish line; it’s more like the scenic route with a soundtrack by your favorite band. 🎶

I used to think that success was all about reaching those big, shiny goals. You know, the ones that feel awesome for like... five minutes before you're onto the next thing. But what if we looked at success as a journey instead of a destination?

**Here’s the secret sauce that’s been cooking for me:**

- **Focus on the Small Wins**: It’s easy to overlook the everyday victories. Managed to get out of bed without hitting snooze this morning? 🎉 High-five, you’re already winning! 

- **Be in the Moment**: How often do we go through the motions, missing the good stuff along the way? Like realizing the smell of fresh coffee adds +10 to your happiness meter. ☕️ Bonus points if you actually take a moment to taste it!

- **Set Intentions, Not Just Goals**: Goals can feel like they've got you locked in a cage. Intentions, though? They're more like setting your inner GPS to a ""fun adventure"" setting. Less pressure, more exploration. 🔍

- **Learn From the Pit Stops**: Yep, there will be detours and maybe even a flat tire or two. But hey, that’s where the best stories come from, right? Imagine explaining to future grandchildren how you learned to fix a bike with duct tape. 🚴‍♂️

So, why’s everyone in such a hurry to hit 'success' when the road there is half the fun? 

Let’s share our middle-of-the-journey triumphs and mishaps. What's one 'success on the road' story you've got up your sleeve? Or maybe that twisty part of your path you didn’t see coming but ended up loving anyway?

Remember, friends: life doesn’t have to be a race when it can be a road trip with occasional dance breaks. 💃🕺

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, stories, or that one funny moment when you realized your map was upside down. 😉

So, my (F47) husband (M62, M) recently (14 months ago) changed jobs. He previously had an emotional affair (just a supportive friendship in his words) with a subordinate, “S.” 

M had a physical affair (over 20 years ago) with a different colleague “H” that lead to his prior divorce from “A.” I learned about his relationship with S through what I would now call trickle truth: M wanted to support a coworker. S was abused (BF shot her, she did not press charges). S has a young child from the abusive BF and M wants to support her (M has a young child from A, and while I work to be a supportive stepmom, I have no interest having biological children and M does not want any more children). They started texting each other morning, noon and night. He told me that I didn’t understand, they were just friends. He wanted to support her as a single mom. Oh, yeah, he was also her supervisor (as he was for H). I was absolutely livid and he told me he cut contact because I was the more important relationship. 

That lasted for almost 10 months. They “ran into each other at his work.” He “had an opening on his team.” I knew about the opening and that “D” was hired into the spot. Shocker…D left the state for the military and S was second runner up. S will join his team in 2 weeks. Trickle truth rolls in because I’m pissed:  M has been talking to S for the past year. They use WhatsApp…I believe because of different message alerts from a service that M and specifically I don’t use. They’re just friends….i wouldn’t understand….he doesn’t see her like that….they won’t chat anymore….they won’t go out for coffee or lunch anymore…it’s different now that he’s her boss (again).

Meanwhile, dead bedroom for almost 2 years. He’s just older…you know…

And then, her abusive ex sends me a friend request. We have no mutual friends. I haven’t told my hubs about the friend request yet.

I’m stuck wondering why her ex sent the friend request now. Is M screwing S? Is her ex hoping to stir unnecessary shite with perfect (unplanned???) timing? Am I putting myself at risk by accepting the friend request from someone who previously abused a woman but was not charged? Should I just leave his request unanswered? I know it’s not that difficult to find the home address of someone in my state…should I be concerned?",1,1736760035.0,emotionalaffair,0,1.0,False

The guy that liked me is kinda controlling and we’re not even in a relationship yet so I know I’m not going out with him. 
One time he send his wingman to drive me home cause I can’t get a cab and so me and his friend started texting . That night his friend texted,  this guy fainted and that he’s in a critical state. I thought he was joking so I asked him if it was a joke and he assured it’s not a joke and asked if we cud talk on call . I agreed and we talked but he didn’t say nothing about his friend and asked me how I was feeling , (so I had a drama wit my ex recently) he said he wanted to listen and empathise with me . I even cried talking to him and started liking him and I thought maybe he feels the same way . After that he asked me what I felt about the guy (his friend who liked me) , i hesitated at first and then he assured me it’s okay to tell him about what I feel and that I need to get it off my chest so I can feel better so I told him I’m not interested in a LDR also we’re not connecting on an emotional level and he told me this is only between us and it’s not like he’s going to tell his friend about this it’s not a crime to not feel the same way as the other person. 

And so after all that that he stoped being his translator and he asked what I wanted to do , go on walks , grab a bite , anything I was craving and such . I didn’t have an appetite so I told him I wanted to get some fresh air and he asked me lots of questions about where i wanted to go , what I wanted to do and when i want to go and such . I told him I want to go somewhere not very far and crowded (first time being alone with him and all) and he took me out for coffee at this cosy cafe I suggested . At the “date” we were seated outside but he didn’t sit face to face with me , he stood beside me the whole time , asked if I was cold , took my bag for me and was very attentive all but he didn’t sit the whole time we were together and that made it awkward for me so I was kinda closed off . He told me I sud say watever I want to say to him be it about my ex or myself and also to ask him questions if I want to know more . He said he also broke up with his first relationship of 7 months last June so he can relate to how I felt when I broke up with my ex . He said he’s not going to continue any interaction with his ex , he apparently said some harsh words and that hurt the girl and when he later apologised she didn’t accept it so they moved on. Anyways he told me I should clear things out with his friend so his friend also doesn’t get false hope , he asked me if someone approached me at the time would I be able to commit , i said no. And then he asked me if there’s somewhere else I wanted to go or if it’s late for me and I told him it’s late and he drove me home . 
Before getting off he told me to share if anything bothers me or some sad thought come , I said okay and went home . So imo I thought he liked me and the date went okay even though it was awkward because we only talked about exes and the conversation were a bit dry (I’ll admit). So after the date he hasn’t texted me at all . I’m not sure now how he feels about me , is he not interested ? Was I reading too much into things ?

Edit: Also he told me he’s not that close to his friend and they only talked sometimes online , but the other friend (who initially liked me) said he’s a really close friend .

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 1/2 years. He moved in with me a couple of months ago. He's 44 I just turned 40. He's 6' 325lbs. I'm 5'2 137lbs. I divorced 4 years ago and was with my ex for 16 years, he was about twice my age, manipulative, emotionally abusive and when I tried to end the relationship he held me down on the bathroom floor yelling for me not to leave him, I screamed the entire time to let me go and after a few minutes he did, and I walked out and left. 

My current boyfriend and I have shared about our past relationships and how they both ended. 

Present: 
A week ago, my boyfriend and I were both off from work and from the time we woke up we just weren't clicking. I even told him when we were out running errands that we were just on different pages today. Tension was just building between us as the day went on. We got home in the afternoon, and after making some lunch I took a seat on a bar stool to eat. There's three stools and he's sitting at one end (half blocking the hallway the way his stool is sticking out)and I'm at the other. We're arguing, I get up, take my cup and bottle of coke, say I'm done talking about this and try to walk around where he's sitting to go down the hallway to our bedroom. He grabs both of my arms, he gets up and starts pushing me backwards, I am yelling for him to stop, we both trip over a stool, fall to the floor, with him falling on top of me. I immediately start crying hysterically mostly from shock but also bc my hand is hurting from how I landed. He gets up quickly, grabs the bottle of coke (which is exploding) and walks out the front door and I assume tosses the bottle in the yard. He comes back in,picks me up off the floor from behind (underneath my armpits) my feet barely touching the ground, and drags me backwards about 5 feet until we reach the seat of the sofa where he slams me backwards down on the cushion. So I'm now sitting on the sofa. He drags the coffee table over, sits down on it so he's facing me and takes both of his hands, palms either side of my face hard, makes me look up and holds my face for at least a minute while he's yelling that im a spoiled brat, my behavior is disgusting, etc etc. I try to push his knee out of the way so I can get up, I tell him to stop, he tells me to stop and won't let me up, I try and fail again. So I just sit there. He lets go of my face and after about 5 more mins he gets up and continues to yell at me as he begins to mop the floor. After about 5 mins of this, I get up and walk out of the house. I came back 20 mins later, after he called. A week later, we're still together, we've talked, he's apologized everyday for his actions. Nothing like this has ever happened in our relationship, I'm still in shock bc that's not the man I've known for 3 1/2 years. I feel lost, I'm so incredibly angry at him for doing this to me and our relationship. ",1,1736759289.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

I had an issue where the plastic that contacts the switch for the water tank broke when the machine was on. 

The issue at the time was that the “insert water tank” warning was displayed even though the water tank was inserted. The machine was powered on and I powered it off at the mains and repaired the plastic that contacts the switch (The water tank switch is now working). When I started it I got the general alarm warning. I noticed the infuser was in the vertical position and I thought this may be the issue. I disassembled the machine and manually moved the infuser to where I thought was the off position, basically where I was able to remove the infuser as I would do for general maintenance. 

As the machine is disassembled I visually checked what I could and there was nothing obvious. The heater is warm and I checked the thermal fuses which have continuity. I am lost as I cannot go past the “general alarm” on the menu. I know the “general alarm” warning in the instructions talk about cleaning, but that is not the problem. The machine is really clean and I do look after it. I use brita filtered water, I descale regularly and I clean the infuser every 2 weeks approx by rinsing it. I also only allow water into a separate container instead of the drip tray. I wash the removal parts weekly. I was expecting to see old coffee and mould in the machine, but it was great to see a clean machine and there was not one bit of mould. 

I will upload a video showing my issue to see if anyone can help (I did create a post with a video, but it dont upload). I am at a loss here as I don’t want to have to get a new machine as physically the machine looks good but there is an obvious issue that I want to resolve.",1,1736759164.0,DeLonghi,1,1.0,False

Here’s how this concept could be structured:

Company Name:

Illusia AI

Brand Philosophy:

“Believe Beyond Reality.”

Illusia AI thrives on the idea that the boundaries between what’s possible and impossible are self-imposed. By encouraging people to “lie to themselves” in the best way—believing in limitless potential—Illusia AI creates products that feel like magic but are built on cutting-edge technology.

Brunch Concept: “The Illusia Brunch”

Venue Design:
	•	Minimalist, Futuristic Aesthetics: Smooth white surfaces, soft curves, and metallic accents mirror Apple’s clean design philosophy.
	•	Ambient Lighting: Adaptive lighting that changes based on the emotional tone of the space, powered by emotion-detection AI.
	•	Augmented Reality Menus: Guests use sleek AR devices or table projections to interact with the menu, seeing how dishes are prepared in real-time.

Menu Concept:
	•	“Impossible Made Edible”: Dishes that seem unreal but are crafted using molecular gastronomy and AI-driven nutrition science.
	•	Cloud Pancakes: Pancakes that appear to float using magnetic levitation plates.
	•	Echo Avocado Toast: A toast that changes flavor based on the eater’s mood, detected by smart utensils.
	•	Infinity Brew: Coffee that never cools, maintaining the perfect temperature through self-regulating smart mugs.

AI Integration:
	•	Personalized Experiences: AI learns guest preferences over visits, tailoring seating, music, and even menu suggestions.
	•	Virtual Companions: Holographic AI assistants join guests, offering conversation, inspiration, or simply company.
	•	“Lie to Yourself” Wellness Analysis: Interactive tables provide personalized affirmations and wellness insights, encouraging guests to believe in their best selves.

Marketing Tagline:

“What if the impossible was just a thought away?”

Exclusive Product Tie-in:
	•	Illusia Pods: Compact AI devices available for purchase that bring the brunch experience home, offering mood-based recipes and interactive dining.

Why This Works:

By applying the “Lying to Yourself” principle, Illusia AI creates a brunch experience that challenges perceptions of reality. Just as Apple sells more than devices—it sells a lifestyle—Illusia AI sells the idea that technology can blur the line between imagination and reality.",0,1736759000.0,ChatGPT,4,0.2,False

I've had the 600ml sipologie one, it's pouring is not good and the rubber sleeve is practically useless because it gets hot if brewing two cups. 

I currently have the 300ml sipologie one which is great at pouring but the top is too slippery. The v60 keeps moving about (is that normal with carafes?) and the bottom also feels like it needs a rubber pad. Any one know how to solve those two issues? 
 Oh it says 300ml but you can easily brew two cups to about 500ml liquid out. But not more than that. The opening is also not big enough to fit an aeropress.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Imagine stepping into your kitchen and having a voice-activated assistant ready to make cooking easier and more enjoyable. With Alexa in the home kitchen, this scenario becomes a reality. Not only can Alexa help you with measuring ingredients and timing your dishes, but it can also create a more enjoyable cooking environment.

### Recipes at Your Fingertips

When you want to try a new recipe or recreate an old favorite, Alexa can become your go-to sous-chef. Simply ask, “Alexa, find me a recipe for chicken Alfredo.” You’ll receive a variety of recipes tailored to your preferences. You can also specify dietary restrictions by saying, “Alexa, show me gluten-free recipes.” This feature makes it easy for you to explore new cooking methods and ingredients.

### Helpful Measurements

Cooking often requires precise measurements. To avoid the hassle of pulling out measuring cups, ask Alexa to convert units or tell you how many cups are in a quart. You can say:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/alexa-home-kitchen  
  
- “Alexa, how many tablespoons are in a cup?”
- “Alexa, convert 3 ounces to cups.”
- “Alexa, how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon?”

With this information, you can effortlessly adjust recipes to fit available ingredients or personal preferences.

### Timers and Reminders

Have you ever forgotten to check on your food while multitasking in the kitchen? Alexa can set multiple timers for you. Just say, ""Alexa, set a timer for 20 minutes,"" and she'll remind you when time is up. You can even say, “Alexa, set a timer for 10 minutes for the pasta and another for 30 minutes for the chicken.” This feature ensures that your dishes are cooked to perfection without constant monitoring.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/alexa-home-kitchen  
  
### Entertainment While You Cook

Cooking can be a tedious task if done in silence. With Alexa, you can have music, podcasts, or audiobooks playing while you chop and stir. Simply tell her to play your favorite playlist or tune into a podcast. You might enhance your cooking experience by jamming to upbeat tunes or diving into an engaging story as you whip up dinner.

### Smart Kitchen Devices

Integrating Alexa with smart kitchen devices can take your cooking experience to a whole new level. With smart ovens, blenders, and refrigerators, you can control everything hands-free. Here are some devices to consider:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/alexa-home-kitchen

- Smart Coffee Makers: Start brewing your morning cup by requesting, “Alexa, turn on the coffee maker.”
- Smart Thermometers: Get real-time updates about your meat’s temperature without opening the oven door.

These integrations save time and energy and enhance the overall cooking process.

### Grocery Shopping Made Simple

Another fantastic feature of Alexa is simplifying your grocery shopping experience. You can easily add ingredients to your shopping list by saying, “Alexa, add chicken to my shopping list.” This approach helps you keep track of what you need without writing anything down. When you're ready to shop, just ask, “Alexa, what’s on my shopping list?” and you’ll have everything you need at hand.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/alexa-home-kitchen  
  
### Cooking Tips and Tricks

Just ask, “Alexa, how do I soften butter quickly?” or “Alexa, what’s the best way to chop an onion without crying?” You'll be surprised by how much support this little device can offer, helping you enhance your cooking skills.

### Plan Meals with Ease

Meal planning can sometimes feel overwhelming. Luckily, Alexa can assist with easy meal planning solutions. Ask her for inspirations based on what you have in your pantry and fridge. By saying, “Alexa, suggest a dinner based on chicken and broccoli,” you can reduce food waste and enjoy new meal ideas.

1i09xtc,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1i09xtc/a_tale_of_two_births/,A tale of two births,"My first baby girl, born in 2023, was frank breech. My amniotic fluid was low, making it dangerous to turn her. She was born via scheduled c-section, which was just about the only birthing scenario I hadn’t thought of. I’ve felt shame off and on about having a c-section, because of course people make comments, but I also know I did the safest thing for my sweet girl, and that’s all that really matters. 

My second baby girl was born in August, and let me tell you… she made her own way. I was 1cm dilated and ~60% effaced from 36w with inconsistent contractions. By 38w I was fully effaced but only 2cm dilated. I went into L&D two times (on the advice of my midwife) and got turned away. The second time, we discussed an induction but they could only say I might be favorable.

I felt so defeated, I went home that night and told my husband and mom that I didn’t even want to talk about labor. Basically, unless I’m screaming in pain, don’t ask me how I’m feeling lol. I took a bath and went to bed.

I was laying in bed at 7am, half asleep, letting my mom entertain my toddler. My husband was getting ready to leave for work. I heard an insanely loud POP. I was so out of it, my first thought was, “did I break a bone?” 😂 then, slightly more sane, I googled “can you hear your water break?”

Turns out, YA SURE CAN. 

Mu mom and husband were having coffee in the kitchen. I went out there, still in shock, and leaned over the counter for a contraction. Both of them were too scared to ask how I was doing, ha, and I was too scared of another false alarm. I awkwardly walked to our bathroom. And that’s when water went everywhere. Whaaaat a weird sensation.

Next thing I know I’m on my knees, holding onto our couch, and my husband is comically, adorably, frantically loading the car going “this is it!” My mom is distracting my toddler in the backyard and I have just enough time between contractions to make eye contact and say goodbye. I’ll never forget that moment.

The car ride highlighted for me just how many potholes my city has. Dear God. While in the ER waiting room, my contractions sped up and there was sooo much water. I’d have been embarrassed if it weren’t for the incredible fucking pain. 

We arrived to the hospital around 8am, and baby arrived by 1pm. The time in between was a painful, painful blur, punctuated by hilarious encouragement from my way-overdressed husband, and the most amazing midwife + nurse team. I had an epidural around 11:30, and shortly after felt the urge to push. My biggest fear was tearing, but my girl was 9lbs so… I tore. I still felt a lot, but for me *personally* the epidural took the edge off just enough that I actually felt present while pushing, and immediately after. I had been worried it would make me groggy or unable to manage pushing, but that wasn’t my experience at all. I was way less present when I was in so much pain I couldn’t even open my eyes or hear anything anyone said.

I had very quietly hoped for a VBAC, but I’d been given the odds (not great at my age and weight) and knew it was less likely. I also learned from my first to let go of expectations and just focus on healthy baby, healthy mom. I’m still in disbelief it actually happened. Baby girl is healthy, one part giggles one part banshee 🥲, and I am proud of myself.

My daughters could not have been born more differently, and I’m so thankful for that. I’m sure it’s just the beginning of all the ways they’ll surprise me, and help me grow.

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. Finally got the babe to sleep tonight, but now I can’t sleep, so it felt time to type this out. ",1,1736758853.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

Coffee cafes have always been my go to spots for some peace and quiet a place to chill, sip coffee, read, or just enjoy the ambiance. But yesterday, I went to Corridor Seven, and what I witnessed was nothing short of a nuisance.

What the hell happened to coffee shops being calm and peaceful? The moment I walked in, it felt like I’d accidentally stumbled into a nightclub. Loud, obnoxious music blaring shitty tracks, people acting like they were high on God knows what and the overall vibe was chaotic.

I’ve been to Corridor Seven before, and it used to be such a chill place, exactly how a coffee cafe should be. But this? This was absolute bullshit. I didn’t come there to have my ears blown out or to watch people pretend they’re in some EDM festival. I came for coffee, calmness, and a break from the madness outside.

I’ve been to Kyushu a few times, but I’ve never traveled in the Kanto or Kansai regions, so Hakone will be a whole new experience for me. I realize it’s uncommon to take a taxi directly from the airport to Hakone, but after four years of barely any time off (even on weekends), I really want a stress-free getaway. That’s why I’m skipping Tokyo sightseeing and train travel entirely. Plus, my company will cover the expenses.

I’m comfortable with Japanese (I can follow about 95% of NHK news and enjoy manzai). I don’t drink alcohol, and my main goals are to relax over coffee while enjoying the scenery, visit museums I’ve always wanted to see, and try local cuisine.

Here’s my **tentative budget**, excluding airfare, all in JPY and rounded up to the nearest 1,000 yen:

1. **Round-trip taxi from Haneda Airport to Hakone**: \~54,000 JPY *(I know it’s expensive, but I have back pain and really need good support.)*
2. **Ryokan (2 nights, mid- to upper-range, with dinner & breakfast)**: \~65,000 JPY
3. **Meals (lunch, snacks, etc.)**: \~11,000 JPY
4. **Sightseeing / Entrance Fees** (e.g., museums): \~6,000 JPY
5. **Miscellaneous** (local transport in Hakone if needed): \~6,000 JPY

This adds up to about **142,000 JPY** total (not including my flight).

Does this seem like a realistic budget for a relaxing trip, where I won’t have to worry about transfers or heavy luggage? Am I forgetting anything important, or over/underestimating any costs?

This article is divided into subsections and hence you can directly jump over to whichever information you are looking for. The goal of this article is to provide you with enough information so that you can undertake this trek independently or if you are looking to have more details of the trek for your planning. Thank you for taking your time to go through the information and happy hiking.

**Introduction**

Annapurna Base Camp trek you to the heart of Annapurna Himalayas where you would have magnificient views of the Annapurna ranges and the majestic Fishtail (Macchapuchre) mountain. Nowadays, the trek can be easily completed in 6 Days starting from Pokhara and ending at Pokhara. It is a perfect beginner friendly trek and since the highest elevation is at 4200 metres, there are minor risks of High Altitude Sickness. However, I have observed no of people getting down with Altitude Sickness if they try to push themselves too hard or ascent too fast due to time constraints or personal reasons. It is a perfect starter to the multi day hiking adventure in the Himalayas. The teahouses are well equipped and you can expect creature comforts of hot showers, internet service, electricity, freshly brewed coffee, etc in this trek. By this account, it is still a challenging hike if you don't have a lot of experience hiking and somedays can be pretty demanding. Let's dwelve into the details of the hike starting with:

**Transportation**  
Our journey generally starts from Pokhara. One can hire a private jeep from Pokhara to get to Jhinu which is the last vehicle point of the trek. The cost of single jeep hire ranges from 50-60 USD and hence, if you are in a group of 2-4, this is an ideal way of getting to the trail head. Alternatively, you can also get a shared jeep from Harichowk of Pokhara or Baglung Bus Park, where you can expect to pay about 10-15 USD per person. Mind you, some shared jeeps/buses doesn't go exactly upto Jhinu and diverts mid way to go towards Ghandruk, so you have to essentially get off at the junction and hike for about an hour to get to Jhinu.

**Permits**  
If you are trekking independently, you can acquire FIT Permits from the Nepal Tourism Board Office at [Kathmandu ](https://g.co/kgs/J2nw2PQ)or [Pokhara](https://g.co/kgs/L31LPmz). You have to be present in person, fill up a form with your details, mention Nayapool as an Entry and End Point of the trek, submit the form along with the photocopy of your passport, 2 p.p. size photographs and NRs. 3000. The staffs at NTB would process your forms and hand you the ACAP Permits within 10-15mins. This Permit is all you need to traverse around the majestic Annapurna region and works as a single entry permit. You will be required to submit this permit at the checkpost at Birethanti (after Nayapul) and/or at Chomrong. You will also be required to present the permit during the exit and hence I suggest you to hold onto them till you are back at Pokhara.

**Teahouses and Amenities**  
Annapurna Base Camp trek is laiden with decent teahouses with the creature comforts mentioned above. The food choices are abundant and unless you are going there in high season or peak tourist season, you don't have to worry about not finding Accommodations. Having said that, I have seen quite a no of independent trekkers who arrived in peak season and had to settle for Dining Halls due to lack of rooms. Also, unlike other trekking destinations, the teahouses in ABC route doesn't have firewood heater to keep the rooms warm. Hence, depending on the times of the year, it is advised to carry warm clothes to wear after your arrival at the teahouses.

All the teahouses have hot shower facilities and some even have laundry services. You can expect to pay about NRs. 200 for the Hot Gas Shower and as for the 6-7 days of trek, there would be minimal requirement of laundry services.

**Hydration/Food**  
One of the most blaring questions is of hydration. There are no provisions of bottled water beyond Chomrong and hence, I suggest you to bring a Nalgene Bottle and use Steripen or Water Purification Tablets that you can purchase at Thamel. Alternatively, you can also buy Filtered/Boiled water from the teahouses. However, given your requirement of 3-4 litres daily and the cost of NRs. 150 per litre to NRs. 200 per litre, it can add up quite fast. Hence, I suggest you to bring your own water filtration such as Steripen, Sawyer Filter or Water Purification Tablets.

The food situation is quite good on the trails as there will be plenty of options. I haven't encountered anyone with serious cases of food poisoning so far. The meat products are not available beyond the place called 'Bamboo'. However, I would suggest you refraining from meat products when you are hiking altogether just to be on the safe side.

**Connectivity and Electricity**  
Annapurna Base Camp is well connected with Internet Access all the way to the basecamp. The cellphone connectivity is until Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC) with 4G Connectivity. The internet comes from Fibre Optic connectivity. However, they would ask for additional NRs. 150 - NRs. 200 to use the Internet services, should you require once you reach higher elevations.

Each of the teahouses/camps have their own micro hydropower plant and hence, unless you are staying at the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) or Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC), these two are the only places without electricity and rely on Solar Power.

**Itinerary and Add Ons**  
This is a rough guide to how I plan my treks to Annapurna Base Camp generally.

* Day 1 - Pokhara to Jhinu (By Jeep) and Hike to Chomrong
* Day 2 - Chomrong to Dovan
* Day 3 - Dovan to Deurali
* Day 4 - Deurali to Annapurna Base Camp
* Day 5 - Annapurna Base Camp to Bamboo
* Day 6 - Bamboo to Jhinu and Jeep back to Pokhara

Day 1 - We would start after our breakfast (8-9am) and get on the jeep heading towards Jhinu. The journey would take about 3 hours and we would show our permits at the checkpost in Birethanti. As we reach Jhinu, we would prepare ourselves for the hike, cross a long suspension bridge and begin a rather steep ascent to Chomrong. This would take another 2-3 hours in an average pace and can be completed under 2 hours for a moderately paced hiker. Since we would still be in lower elevations, the conditions are quite hot and humid during the hike, followed up by the chill/cold evening at Chomrong.

Day 2 - We start fairly early from **Chomrong**, depending on the time of the year between 7 am to am. We do so to avoid the ascend of **Upper Sinuwa** in the blaring afternoon sun. There is another checkposts at Chomrong where we enter our permits and off we go downhill for about an hour to be greeted with a suspension bridge. As we cross the beautiful suspension bridge, our steep ascent to **Upper Sinuwa** begins. It might take about 2 hours to reach Upper Sinuwa where we generally take a longer 15-20mins break, have some tea admiring the views. The trail becomes more easier and flatter after Upper Sinuwa and after another hike and a descent we reach **Bamboo**, where we will have our lunch. Generally, we aim to have our lunch between 12-1 pm for an early morning start of 7 am. After our lunch, the trail goes through a slight ascent finally we reach **Dovan** after about 1-1.5 hour of hike after Bamboo.

Day 3 - From **Dovan** to **Himalaya**, it is a pretty accessible trail until we reach a beautiful waterfall after the hike for about 1-1.5 hour. From the waterfall, our ascent begins for another 1-1.5 hour till we reach the place called Himalaya. This is our lunch place for the day and please don't forget to have some Pizza on this place for which it is quite known for. After lunch, we begin a gradual ascent to Hinku Caves for about 2 hours and another 40 mins of hiking would bring us to **Deurali.**

Day 4 - Another early start to the day, the trails are failry accessible with moderate ascent until we reach **Machapuchre Base Camp(MBC)**. The valley opens up and you would be greeted with the awe-inspiring views of the entire Annapurna Himalayas. It takes about 2-3 hours for modertalely paced hikers to reach MBC where we would take a small tea break. Then another 2-3 hours of uphill ascent would bring us to the fabled **Annapurna Base Camp (ABC)**. Today we will have our lunch at Annapurna Base Camp spend time inside the teahouse awaiting the beautiful sunset at ABC. We wil have an early dinner likely 6-7pm and fall asleep to wake up early for one of the most wonderful sunrise at about 5:30am depending upon the time of the year.

Day 5 - After we soak in the scenery, we will have a rather early breakfast in about 6:30-7am and start our preparations to go back down. We bid farewell to the ABC and begin our rather long day to get back down all the way to **Bamboo**. On a good pace, we would have our lunch at Himalaya and reach Bamboo by 2-3 pm. However, for average pace, it might take 1-2 hours longer. I have had clients where they were exceptionally fast paced and we managed to get back down all the way to **Lower Sinuwa or Chomrong** at some instances. But, for regular hikers, this is a perfect place to call it a night and take on the journey next day.

Day 6 - As we begin our journey back to **Jhinu**, we would have our lunch at **Chomrong**. Today would also be a rather long day and suggest you to start early. It takes about 1.5 hour from Bamboo to Upper Sinuwa and another 2-3 hours from Upper Sinuwa to Chomrong. We will stamp our permits again at Chomrong. After lunch, we descend to Jhinu (1.5 hours) and get on the jeep to head over to Pokhara, again exiting the ACAP Checkpost at Birethati on the way.

This is the overall summary of the 6 days itinerary. Now, as far as the concerns for **Altitude Sickness** goes, you would have to be vigilant from **Deurali (3300metres).** Some decide to stay at **MBC (3700m)** and decide to take a early morning hike to **ABC (2hours).** However, I prefer to head over to ABC and fortunately, all of my clients have been fine and/or only presented mild symptoms of Altitude Sickness like Headache. However, pertaining to your conditions, you can make your own judgement on what fits you the best.

**Add Ons**  
Now onto the add ons for this itinerary, you can also continue to head towards Annapurna Sanctuary trek after returning back to Chomrong. Instead of continuing onto Jhinu, you can have an itinerary like this:

Day 6 - Bamboo to Chomrong  
Day 7 - Chomrong to Tadhapani  
Day 8 - Tadhapani to Ghorepani  
Day 9 - Early Morning hike to Poonhill (1.5 hours, back to Ghorepani (45mins) and hike to Birethanti (3 hours) and Jeep to Pokhara (3 hours)

OR

Day 9 - Hike to Poonhill - Back to Ghorepani (Breakfast) and Hike to Tatopani (Shikha)  
Day 10 - Tatopani to Pokhara (By Bus or Jeep) - 4 hours

In my opinion, if you have the time I suggest you to hike down to Tatopani from Ghorepani. Technically, you will come across a small town called Pokharebagar from which you can take a taxi (NRs. 500) to Tatopani. It is famous for its natural hot springs and actually a perfect way to end your trek. However, if you dont have the time or doesn's suit you on the budget, you can end your hike at Day 9 and take the jeep back to Pokhara from Birethanti.

Please bear in mind that the jeep access to Birethanti or Jhinu might be blocked in monsoon seasons or periods of heavy rainfall and hence plan accordingly.

**Gears and Equipments**

Head Torch  
Toilet Paper, Hand Sanitizer and Wet Tissues  
Water Filtration System (Sawyer or Steripen)  
Water Purification Tablets (Aqua Tabs)  
Nalgene Bottle (1ltr) or Hydration Bladder or both

**Cost**  
The age old important question of how much this might cost you to do this trek. Apart from the obvious cost of permits, transportations, etc you can expect to spend about 30-50USD per day for your Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Accommodation along with some extras such as Hot Shower, Phone Charge or Internet services. There are trekkers who have done this trek in really small budget as well but it all depends on your dietary habits and preferenes.

Along with that, you can expect to pay about **30-50 USD** for an experienced trekking guide depending on his/her experience, qualifications, communication skills, group size, etc and about **15-20 USD per day for the Trek Assist (Porter Services).**

Generally, when I package for the Annapurna Base Camp trek, I create a packaged cost that includes:

1. ACAP Permits
2. Transportation
3. Guide and Porter Fees incl Insurance

And leave the responsibility of managing the cost of Food and Accommodation to the trekkers themselves. As always, pertaining to your budget you might find either of the options (doing it entirely independently or packaged service costs), viable for you.

**Conclusion**  
Hopefully, this article was meaningful to assist you for the wonderful Annapurna Base Camp trek and left you with enough information to do it independently if you deem so. I haven't gone into full details of the landscape and the views as I would like you guys to be mesmerized upon your encounter to the beautiful himalayas.

This article is divided into subsections and hence you can directly jump over to whichever information you are looking for. The goal of this article is to provide you with enough information so that you can undertake this trek independently or if you are looking to have more details of the trek for your planning. Thank you for taking your time to go through the information and happy hiking. 

**Introduction**

Annapurna Base Camp trek you to the heart of Annapurna Himalayas where you would have magnificient views of the Annapurna ranges and the majestic Fishtail (Macchapuchre) mountain. Nowadays, the trek can be easily completed in 6 Days starting from Pokhara and ending at Pokhara. It is a perfect beginner friendly trek and since the highest elevation is at 4200 metres, there are minor risks of High Altitude Sickness. However, I have observed no of people getting down with Altitude Sickness if they try to push themselves too hard or ascent too fast due to time constraints or personal reasons. It is a perfect starter to the multi day hiking adventure in the Himalayas. The teahouses are well equipped and you can expect creature comforts of hot showers, internet service, electricity, freshly brewed coffee, etc in this trek. By this account, it is still a challenging hike if you don't have a lot of experience hiking and somedays can be pretty demanding. Let's dwelve into the details of the hike starting with:

**Transportation**  
Our journey generally starts from Pokhara. One can hire a private jeep from Pokhara to get to Jhinu which is the last vehicle point of the trek. The cost of single jeep hire ranges from 50-60 USD and hence, if you are in a group of 2-4, this is an ideal way of getting to the trail head. Alternatively, you can also get a shared jeep from Harichowk of Pokhara or Baglung Bus Park, where you can expect to pay about 10-15 USD per person. Mind you, some shared jeeps/buses doesn't go exactly upto Jhinu and diverts mid way to go towards Ghandruk, so you have to essentially get off at the junction and hike for about an hour to get to Jhinu. 

**Permits**  
If you are trekking independently, you can acquire FIT Permits from the Nepal Tourism Board Office at [Kathmandu ](https://g.co/kgs/J2nw2PQ)or [Pokhara](https://g.co/kgs/L31LPmz). You have to be present in person, fill up a form with your details, mention Nayapool as an Entry and End Point of the trek, submit the form along with the photocopy of your passport, 2 p.p. size photographs and NRs. 3000. The staffs at NTB would process your forms and hand you the ACAP Permits within 10-15mins. This Permit is all you need to traverse around the majestic Annapurna region and works as a single entry permit. You will be required to submit this permit at the checkpost at Birethanti (after Nayapul) and/or at Chomrong. You will also be required to present the permit during the exit and hence I suggest you to hold onto them till you are back at Pokhara. 

**Teahouses and Amenities**  
Annapurna Base Camp trek is laiden with decent teahouses with the creature comforts mentioned above. The food choices are abundant and unless you are going there in high season or peak tourist season, you don't have to worry about not finding Accommodations. Having said that, I have seen quite a no of independent trekkers who arrived in peak season and had to settle for Dining Halls due to lack of rooms. Also, unlike other trekking destinations, the teahouses in ABC route doesn't have firewood heater to keep the rooms warm. Hence, depending on the times of the year, it is advised to carry warm clothes to wear after your arrival at the teahouses. 

All the teahouses have hot shower facilities and some even have laundry services. You can expect to pay about NRs. 200 for the Hot Gas Shower and as for the 6-7 days of trek, there would be minimal requirement of laundry services. 

**Hydration/Food**  
One of the most blaring questions is of hydration. There are no provisions of bottled water beyond Chomrong and hence, I suggest you to bring a Nalgene Bottle and use Steripen or Water Purification Tablets that you can purchase at Thamel. Alternatively, you can also buy Filtered/Boiled water from the teahouses. However, given your requirement of 3-4 litres daily and the cost of NRs. 150 per litre to NRs. 200 per litre, it can add up quite fast. Hence, I suggest you to bring your own water filtration such as Steripen, Sawyer Filter or Water Purification Tablets.   


The food situation is quite good on the trails as there will be plenty of options. I haven't encountered anyone with serious cases of food poisoning so far. The meat products are not available beyond the place called 'Bamboo'. However, I would suggest you refraining from meat products when you are hiking altogether just to be on the safe side. 

**Connectivity and Electricity**  
Annapurna Base Camp is well connected with Internet Access all the way to the basecamp. The cellphone connectivity is until Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC) with 4G Connectivity. The internet comes from Fibre Optic connectivity. However, they would ask for additional NRs. 150 - NRs. 200 to use the Internet services, should you require once you reach higher elevations. 

Each of the teahouses/camps have their own micro hydropower plant and hence, unless you are staying at the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) or Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC), these two are the only places without electricity and rely on Solar Power. 

**Itinerary and Add Ons**  
This is a rough guide to how I plan my treks to Annapurna Base Camp generally. 

* Day 1 - Pokhara to Jhinu (By Jeep) and Hike to Chomrong
* Day 2 - Chomrong to Dovan
* Day 3 - Dovan to Deurali
* Day 4 - Deurali to Annapurna Base Camp
* Day 5 - Annapurna Base Camp to Bamboo
* Day 6 - Bamboo to Jhinu and Jeep back to Pokhara

This is the overall summary of the 6 days itinerary. Now, as far as the concerns for **Altitude Sickness** goes, you would have to be vigilant from **Deurali (3300metres).** Some decide to stay at **MBC (3700m)** and decide to take a early morning hike to **ABC (2hours).** However, I prefer to head over to ABC and fortunately, all of my clients have been fine and/or only presented mild symptoms of Altitude Sickness like Headache. However, pertaining to your conditions, you can make your own judgement on what fits you the best. 

**Add Ons**  
Now onto the add ons for this itinerary, you can also continue to head towards Annapurna Sanctuary trek after returning back to Chomrong. Instead of continuing onto Jhinu, you can have an itinerary like this:

Day 6 - Bamboo to Chomrong  
Day 7 - Chomrong to Tadhapani  
Day 8 - Tadhapani to Ghorepani  
Day 9 - Early Morning hike to Poonhill (1.5 hours, back to Ghorepani (45mins) and hike to Birethanti (3 hours) and Jeep to Pokhara (3 hours)

OR 

Day 9 - Hike to Poonhill - Back to Ghorepani (Breakfast) and Hike to Tatopani (Shikha)  
Day 10 - Tatopani to Pokhara (By Bus or Jeep) - 4 hours

In my opinion, if you have the time I suggest you to hike down to Tatopani from Ghorepani. Technically, you will come across a small town called Pokharebagar from which you can take a taxi (NRs. 500) to Tatopani. It is famous for its natural hot springs and actually a perfect way to end your trek. However, if you dont have the time or doesn's suit you on the budget, you can end your hike at Day 9 and take the jeep back to Pokhara from Birethanti.

Please bear in mind that the jeep access to Birethanti or Jhinu might be blocked in monsoon seasons or periods of heavy rainfall and hence plan accordingly.

1i09ovy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1i09ovy/how_to_choose_furniture_that_grows_with_your/,How to Choose Furniture That Grows with Your Family’s Needs,"As your family grows and evolves, so do your living space requirements. From welcoming new members to adapting to changing lifestyles, choosing the right [furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) that can keep up with these transitions is essential. Whether you’re furnishing a new home or updating your current space, selecting versatile and functional pieces ensures your investment in [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) pays off for years to come. Here’s a guide to choosing [home furniture Dubai](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) that grows with your family’s needs.

# 1. Prioritize Versatility and Functionality

When selecting home furniture, versatility is key. Multi-functional pieces like extendable dining tables, modular sofas, and storage ottomans are perfect examples of furniture that can adapt to your family’s changing requirements. These designs not only save space but also provide added functionality for a growing household.

**Tip:** Look for modern furniture with clean lines and neutral tones, making it easy to adapt as your decor style evolves over time.

# 2. Invest in Quality and Durability

With kids, pets, or frequent gatherings, your furniture needs to withstand wear and tear. Opt for high-quality materials that are durable and easy to maintain, such as stain-resistant fabrics, solid wood, or metal frames. Investing in well-crafted home furniture ensures longevity and saves you money in the long run.

**Pro Tip:** For those in Dubai, consider visiting a trusted [home furniture shop](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to explore a wide range of durable and stylish options that fit your family’s needs.

# 3. Choose Scalable Furniture for Growing Families

Children grow fast, and their needs change even faster. Opt for scalable furniture that can adapt to these transitions. For example:

* **Cribs that convert into toddler beds**
* **Adjustable desks and chairs** for kids and teenagers
* Modular storage units that can expand as needed

These pieces save you from the hassle and cost of frequent replacements while ensuring your home remains functional and stylish.

# 4. Focus on Storage Solutions

A growing family means more belongings to store, from toys and books to seasonal clothing and essentials. Choose modern furniture with built-in storage, such as beds with under-bed drawers, coffee tables with compartments, or wall-mounted shelves. This not only keeps your home organized but also maximizes available space.

**Dubai Tip:** Many home furniture shops in Dubai offer customizable storage solutions that seamlessly blend functionality with style, perfect for modern homes.

# 5. Consider Timeless Design

Trendy designs may appeal initially, but they may not age well as your family’s needs change. Instead, invest in timeless modern furniture that complements various decor styles. Neutral tones, classic silhouettes, and high-quality finishes ensure your furniture remains relevant as your home evolves.

**Design Tip:** Pair timeless pieces with accessories like cushions, rugs, and artwork to add personality without committing to specific styles.

# 6. Think About Space Optimization

For families in apartments or compact homes, space optimization is crucial. Furniture that serves multiple purposes—such as sofa beds, foldable dining tables, or nesting tables—can make a big difference in maximizing your living space.

**Suggestion:** If you're looking for compact yet stylish options, a home furniture shop in Dubai can provide innovative designs tailored for small spaces.

# 7. Involve the Whole Family

When choosing home furniture, involve your family in the decision-making process. This ensures everyone’s needs are met and helps create a home that feels personal and inclusive. For example, let kids pick storage colors or involve teenagers in selecting study desks to ensure their preferences are considered.

**Why Buy Home Furniture in Dubai?**

Dubai is home to a diverse range of home furniture shops offering everything from luxurious modern furniture to functional and affordable designs. Whether you’re furnishing a villa or a cozy apartment, home furniture in Dubai caters to a variety of tastes and budgets. With many stores offering customizable pieces, you can easily find furniture that grows with your family’s needs.

**Final Thoughts**

Choosing furniture that evolves with your family is all about blending functionality, durability, and timeless style. By prioritizing adaptable designs, investing in quality materials, and incorporating smart storage solutions, you can create a home that meets your family’s needs now and in the future.

""Wait... Ouch..."" Julia couldn't help but struggle, sweating profusely in pain.

""Shh."" The man firmly held her down, grabbing her wrists to prevent her from moving.

I am in what feels like month 3891 of a flare. I don't even know what a flare is anymore. It's just been like this for as long as I can remember now. I am irritable, snappy and have no patience at all with anything. 

My son is 10 and hates school. He makes every excuse possible to try not to go. Refuses to do homework until the last minute and then acts up the whole time. It's just a constant battle to get him to go in, read, practice spellings and do his maths homework. This has been a huge irritation this weekend and I've not handled it well at all. I started off fine and understood the issues etc and then by about hour 8 of yesterday's meltdown tantrum panic attacks about school which happens every Sunday, I snapped. 

My husband is autistic and is currently hyper focussed on a game which he has played for 10 years and adores. I love it for him, that he has such a passion. But it's very technical with numbers and rotations and all sorts. Which is why he loves it. But he talks *at* me about it without taking a breath and it's getting overwhelming. 

I have fibromyalgia, CFS and POTs. And right now I feel like utter crap and need a month alone in my room with the Sims, my little dog and coffee. And no human contact. Obviously that's impossible. 😂 I am about to go and drag my child to school and then go to work. And I don't want to. 

So rant over, apologies. Is there anything I can try to be more considerate and calm in the house. And not snap and shout? I have tried meditation, that doesn't work. I immediately get asked a question, shouted, interrupted. Mindfulness doesn't seem to work either. I always feel like I'm constantly giving in against my needs and wishes to keep everyone else happy. 

Might accidentally lock myself in the bathroom for a few hours later and say I can't get out. Shame ",4,1736756421.0,Fibromyalgia,2,1.0,False

I'm new to the coffee world and was confused by all the options. I limited myself to BT to reduce confusion, but even in BT, there was so much to choose from, I was just opening and comparing product pages on the site to figure out what should be in my first mix sample collection.

So I made this database where I visited every product page, manually imported every single piece of information about every product, and then could see everything at one glance. It's in Notion, so I can sort and filter based on my requirements. For example, I can filter to show all blends with a bitterness of less than 4, flavor of chocolaty and compatible equipment as Aeropress.

I also exported this database as CSV, imported it into my AI tools, and had amazing discussions and recommendations by AI for me based on my taste preferences.

Here is the link to the database, you can duplicate it into your notion account as well: - [Coffee Database](https://tavlean.notion.site/160e652a294780069177d45cee7b92a6?v=20bf92b96c7f49c9b57692652df35210)",6,1736756368.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.81,False

It just struck me that I enjoy this moment of solitude most mornings as I do my 30 mins or so in the eve when my wife has gone to bed a bit earlier and I'll sit with a book and a whisky or just muck about watching stupid reels on my phone.

What are your guys' versions of these little moments and don't you feel they mean so much more now your life is a bit more packed!?",2,1736756096.0,daddit,6,1.0,False
