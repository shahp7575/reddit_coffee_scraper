If your Arudha falls in the first house, others perceive you as an energetic and impulsive individual who prioritizes fitness and physical appearance. Your charming and magnetic personality naturally draws people to you. You're often viewed as a risk-taker, prone to acting on instinct without deliberating extensively. This trait may lead others to believe that you'd excel as an entrepreneur or in sports, leveraging your passion and talent to achieve success in your chosen hobby or pursuit.


2. If your Arudha falls in the 2nd house, others may perceive you as someone who prioritizes discussion over action, often focusing on talk rather than tangible results. Please note that this is merely their perception, not necessarily reflective of reality. Additionally, people may view you as someone with a penchant for fine food, jewelry, and impeccable fashion sense. Your tendency to indulge in self-care and personal spending might lead others to see you as somewhat self-centered. However, it's also acknowledged that you possess a natural talent for managing finances and accumulating wealth. Your voice and unique style often command attention, and you're perceived as an adept negotiator, capable of brokering seemingly impossible deals through your articulate and persuasive communication.


3. If your Arudha falls in the 3rd house, others tend to perceive you as a vibrant and effervescent personality. You come across as talkative and youthful, with a somewhat playful demeanor that may be misinterpreted as immaturity. Your romantic and affectionate nature is evident, as you delight in sentimental gestures, such as coffee dates, movie nights, and frequent travels. People admire your exceptional research skills and are drawn to your remarkable talents, which might include dancing, public speaking, writing, astrology, or singing. However, your exuberance can sometimes be perceived as irritating or annoying. Nevertheless, your quick wit and good sense of humor often help to diffuse any tension and leave a lasting impression


4. If your Arudha falls in the 4th house, others perceive you as a private and secretive individual, fiercely protective of your personal life. Despite close relationships, you're cautious about sharing intimate details, maintaining a sense of reserve. You feel most at ease within the comfort of your family and home, and tend to be selective about opening up to others. Nevertheless, you're content with your own company and possess a caring, intuitive nature. Your ability to offer sage advice is valued, and while you may not readily share your own belongings, others find solace in confiding in you about their personal lives.


5. If your Arudha falls in the 5th house, others regard you as exceptionally intelligent, possessing a profound and detailed understanding of various subjects. Your vast knowledge and intellectual prowess can effortlessly captivate others, making you a compelling leader with a natural ability to influence people. However, this perception also has a flip side: others may view you as arrogant and egoistic, someone who tends to dominate and control others. Despite this, people acknowledge your hidden talents and believe you have the potential to excel as a teacher, mentor, or guide. Your innate leadership qualities and natural charisma make you a born leader, capable of inspiring and guiding others.


6. If your Arudha falls in the 6th house, others perceive you as an analytical individual who tends to be reserved and cautious in opening up to others. You're seen as practical, grounded, and responsible, but also prone to being overly critical of others, often demanding perfection while acknowledging your own imperfections. Your competitive nature can evoke jealousy in many, and your argumentative streak, fueled by your reliance on logic and facts, may lead others to view you unfavorably. This intense focus on rationality can be off-putting to those who prefer a more emotional or intuitive approach. Furthermore, people may see you as either extremely health-conscious or completely indifferent to conscious eating.


7. If your Arudha falls in the 7th house, others perceive you as a diplomatic individual, adept at navigating complex situations without taking sides. They may view you as judgmental, although this is merely their perception, not necessarily an accurate reflection of your character. You're seen as having a keen business mind and a distinctive physical attribute that captures attention, such as striking eyes or exceptional hair. People believe you possess a natural charm that effortlessly attracts the opposite sex, and you may even have secret admirers. While others admire your sophistication and impressive social skills, which enable you to effortlessly draw crowds, they may also harbor reservations about your trustworthiness due to your sociable nature, fearing that you might inadvertently reveal their personal secrets.


8. If your Arudha Lagna falls in this house, people unequivocally view you as an enigmatic and intuitive individual. They may also perceive you as frugal, regardless of whether this trait accurately describes you. You're seen as clever, introverted, and possessing exceptional intuition. However, others believe you struggle with emotional balance, experiencing unpredictable mood swings and difficulty controlling your emotions. People also associate you with a strong interest in occult sciences or a natural talent for them. Additionally, they admire your in-depth knowledge of a particular subject, as well as your sharp wit and discerning judgment. According to others, you possess the ability to read people through their facial expressions. They also view you as charismatic, magnetic, and possessing a strong sensual presence. Furthermore, people believe you have a knack for navigating risky financial ventures, such as the stock market or cryptocurrency, and demonstrate a natural aptitude for finance.


9. If your Arudha Lagna falls in the 9th house, others perceive you as an exceptionally fortunate individual. Please note that this is their perspective, which may not always align with reality. You're seen as a devout and spiritual person, with a deep love and reverence for the divine. Your inherent purity earns you a reputation as a trustworthy individual among those around you. Your curiosity drives you to explore diverse cultures, and you're always eager to acquire new knowledge. You possess a remarkable ability to offer insightful advice at precisely the right moment. Travel, particularly to foreign destinations or on extended trips, is a passion of yours, as is engaging with people from different cultural backgrounds. You enjoy discussing history, religion, languages, and spirituality, and have a thirst for adventure. While your vast knowledge is admirable, your tendency to offer unsolicited advice can sometimes be perceived as annoying. Additionally, people may notice a distinctive foreign element in your appearance, mannerisms, or habits, such as your accent, hair color, or eye color.


10. If your Arudha falls in the 10th house, others perceive you as an ambitious and career-driven individual, primarily focused on your professional image, finances, and long-term success. You're seen as a serious and driven person who prioritizes commitment and stability in relationships, rather than casual romantic entanglements. You maintain a professional demeanor, avoiding gossip and unnecessary drama, which can sometimes lead others to view you as aloof. Your high standards and relentless pursuit of excellence may give the impression that you're selfish and status-conscious, constantly seeking recognition and validation. Nevertheless, your exceptional organizational skills and dedication to your work are undeniable.


11. If your Arudha falls in the 11th house, others perceive you as a charismatic individual with exceptional social skills, effortlessly connecting with people from diverse backgrounds, including foreigners. You're seen as an outgoing and sociable person who thrives in party environments and gatherings. Your materialistic side is also apparent, and you're believed to be adept at learning and speaking multiple languages, as well as possessing technical expertise. You're viewed as someone who stays up-to-date with the latest trends, but also spends an inordinate amount of time on your phone. While you're perceived as laid-back and averse to staying at home, others also view you as dishonest and prone to gossiping, often unintentionally sharing confidential information. Additionally, people may see you as someone who achieves fame and gets what you want without much effort, and who frequently daydreams. Your talent and interpersonal skills can make you more popular than those around you. However, it's also possible that others see you as someone who presents a false image, hiding your true nature.


12. If your Arudha Lagna falls in the 12th house, others perceive you as someone who is laid-back and inclined to surrender to divine fate, rather than taking proactive steps. This nature of yours often leads people to view you as superstitious or a blind follower. You're seen as someone who can spend an entire day in quiet contemplation or rest, seeking truth and authenticity in all aspects of life. While you may struggle with social skills, particularly in business settings, your pure heart and spiritual wisdom make you an inspiring motivational speaker. You tend to attract mature individuals, rather than those of your own age or younger. Your exceptional intuition and spiritual knowledge are considered your greatest strengths, and people believe that these qualities bring positive experiences into your life.

Note:- This is about how others view you, so do not get triggered by the negative points, Arudha lagna is our image not the actual reality. check from signs also eg. First house/Aries sign.

1in24rl,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1in24rl/i_friendzoned_him_after_he_friendzoned_me/,I friendzoned him after he friendzoned me,"Read this if this post is too long: I met this guy at high school, and we started an situationship, and when I finally asked him what are we, he said we are just friends, so I moved on. Now two years later we met 3 times and now he wants to start an relationship, and I told him I'm not interested. He sended me an long message how he didn't see the issue and wanted me to explain my toughtproses behind my decision. I did. Now he told me that he has to gather his toughts, and he will provide me with an response next week?????????????

This is mainly just an vent. Okay, so I (20F) met this guy (20M) in high school a few years ago. We became friends, and over time, I developed a crush on him. I acted on it, and it led to a situationship. We never slept together, but we spent a lot of time cuddling and having deep conversations about feelings and other personal things. At the time, we were both 18. One night, while we were cuddling in his bed, watching a movie, I asked him what we were. His response? ""We're just friends, and nothing more."" Okay? I didn’t really question him—I just took a step back and kept our interactions strictly friendly. After that, our connection naturally faded.

Now, after two years, he suddenly reached out, wanting to meet up. I agreed, since we had been friends before. To be honest, when we met for coffee, it was pretty boring. At first, I thought it was just because the connection had faded over time, but as we talked, I realized he hadn’t really moved on in life since high school. He still had no real goals or direction, and it felt like he was stuck in the same place. Anyway, it wasn’t that bad, and I was surprised when he wanted to meet up again so soon after. At first, I declined—honestly, I just didn’t have the time—but he kept asking until we finally found a date that worked for both of us. This time, we met at a game café and played some board games. It was actually kind of fun—until I started getting the sense that he was testing the waters and trying to flirt. I didn’t respond to it in any way, which should have been a clear sign that I wasn’t interested. Thankfully, he didn’t push it.

The third time we met, he started asking things like what my ideal type was and whether I had a Valentine. I told him that I wasn´t looking for an relationship right now, but instead of getting the message, he panicked and asked if I had ever had feelings for him in the past. I told him that at one point, I thought we could have been a possibility, but he didn’t feel the same way, and I haven’t thought about it since. That’s when he claimed he had no memory of us ever having that conversation—then followed it up by asking if I would be open to something between us in the future.

I asked him what he meant by that. He started talking about how, in the past, he thought I wasn’t mature enough for him and that he had just wanted closeness. Then he went on about how he enjoys talking to me now and how much I’ve changed. So, am I just enough for him now, or does he actually have feelings for me? When I asked him directly, he told me that he did have feelings for me—then added that I should really think about my answer before giving it to him. He wanted me to be his ""life long partner."" I made it clear that I only saw him as a friend and that nothing more was ever going to happen between us.

Later that day, he sent me messages saying he didn’t see the issue. He told me that he struggles with opening up but was willing to face that fear for me. He also wanted me to explain my thought process behind my decision. So, I told him. I pointed out that he talked a lot about why he wanted me, emphasizing that I was more mature now than I was in high school. But based on his words, his idea of maturity seems to be just about living alone—when in reality, it also includes emotional intelligence and having real goals in life. If he had actually bothered to get to know the person I am now, he wouldn’t have started the conversation by asking if I used to have feelings for him. It was clear that he didn’t really care about what I wanted. When I tried to explain that if I were to spend my life with someone, I would need them to show me that they genuinely wanted me in their life, he seemed completely confused—like he couldn’t understand why simply saying he wanted me wasn’t enough. I also told him that if he has trouble opening up, he should work on that for himself—not for me, and not for anyone else. I told him that I was looking for something different, but I hoped he would find someone who wants the same things as he does.

He responded by saying that he needed time to gather his thoughts and that he had a lot to say. He mentioned there were some misunderstandings he wanted to clear up but that he couldn’t put them into words just yet. He told me he would give me an answer sometime next week... Wtf? Should I just block him?",1,1739290158.0,self,0,1.0,False
1in24mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1in24mh/mounjaro_and_hard_stools/,Mounjaro and hard stools,"I’ve been on Mounjaro for 7 months. It’s done wonders for my glucose levels, helping take me from an A1C of 13.4 to 5.8 as of mid December. My current quasi-struggle (it’s more of a nuisance at this point) is hard stools and mild, occasional constipation.


My fiber intake is, I think, reasonable. I’m eating between 50 and 60 grams per day. 70% or so come from low carb bread (insoluble fiber), the rest from veggies. I drink 80+ ounces of liquid per day. Coffee, tea, water, diet soda. Stool softener (docusate sodium) has helped mitigate a bit, but I really don’t think taking it regularly is the best way to keep things moving well. I have a follow up with my PCP in April and I’ll definitely be discussing this with him. I’m wondering what others who have experienced this do to help? I can introduce more fiber into my daily routine, but I don’t wanna risk eating too much fiber. I can add supplements…Metamucil or similar. I can certainly drink more liquids. Any other ideas?

As someone who values a fresh and hot cup of coffee every morning, I was curious about how this coffee maker stands out among the competition. There's no denying the innovation here, but it's not without its quirks.

Starting with the **design and build quality**, the black and stainless steel finish gives the machine a modern and sleek appearance. It’s compact enough to sit on my crowded kitchen counter without dominating the space. The materials seem durable, though the plastic used in certain parts—such as the brew basket—feels a bit on the cheaper side. Unfortunately, I noticed this aspect when a friend managed to snap the basket handle while making a batch of coffee. While the company quickly replaced the part under warranty, it left me wondering about its long-term durability.

[Check Hamilton Beach 48465 Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-48465-coffee-maker-review-b001r4lk1q/)

Moving on to **brewing performance**, this coffee maker impressed me with its ability to brew consistently rich and flavorful coffee. The internal heating system keeps the coffee warm for up to four hours without scorching it—a lifesaver for days when I’m juggling multiple tasks and can’t get to my cup right away. I appreciated the flexible brew settings, which allowed me to select between bold, regular, 1-4 cups, and even iced coffee. The bold option, in particular, produced a deep, robust cup that rivaled my local coffee shop's brew.

**Customization and controls** were straightforward. The programmable timer made it easy to set up my morning brew the night before, and the digital display was clear and easy to read. My only gripe was the dispensing bar, which required more pressure than I expected. Pushing my mug against it sometimes caused the machine to slide slightly on my counter, despite its rubber pads. A minor annoyance, sure, but one that could’ve been avoided with a bit more design refinement.

In terms of **ease of use**, I found the machine generally user-friendly. Filling the water reservoir was simple, and the lack of a glass carafe meant one less fragile item to worry about. The one-handed dispensing system was especially convenient when I was rushing out the door with a travel mug. However, my elderly mother struggled a bit with the dispensing bar's resistance, so it might not be ideal for those with limited mobility.

Cleaning and maintenance were a mixed bag. The internal tank and brew basket are removable, which made cleaning relatively easy. However, the odd shape of the tank required a bit of extra effort to scrub thoroughly. Thankfully, the built-in cleaning reminders on the digital display were helpful and ensured I didn’t forget routine descaling.

The **capacity and size** of the coffee maker are sufficient for a household of coffee drinkers. The 12-cup internal reservoir meant I didn’t have to brew multiple batches to keep everyone caffeinated. Its counter-friendly design was a bonus considering how precious kitchen real estate can be.

**Pros**

* Keeps coffee warm for hours without burning.
* Multiple brewing options, including iced coffee.
* No fragile glass carafe to break or replace.
* Compact and stylish design.
* Programmable timer for convenience.

**Cons**

* Plastic components feel less durable; basket handle broke within months.
* Dispensing bar requires significant pressure, which might be challenging for some users.
* Cleaning the internal tank can be tricky due to its shape.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When I compared this coffee maker to others in its price range, such as the Cuisinart DCC-3200 and the Ninja CE251, it became clear that the Hamilton Beach 48465 excels in certain areas. Unlike the Ninja CE251, which relies on a glass carafe, the Hamilton Beach eliminates the risk of breaking and spilling coffee. However, the Ninja offers a more intuitive user experience with its easy-pour carafe and better durability in its components.

The Cuisinart DCC-3200, on the other hand, provides a similar level of coffee flavor and brewing options but includes a stainless steel carafe that retains heat effectively. While the Cuisinart feels more robust overall, it doesn’t keep coffee warm as long as the Hamilton Beach's internal tank system.

Where the Hamilton Beach really shines is its dispensing system. Not having to deal with a traditional carafe simplifies the morning routine, making it a strong contender for those who value convenience over traditional coffee maker designs.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee maker sits in the mid-range price category, and I believe it offers solid value for what it delivers. Its innovative design and ability to keep coffee warm for hours make it a worthy investment for busy households. Sure, the plastic parts could be sturdier, but considering the features and performance, it holds its own against pricier competitors. If you can overlook the minor issues, this model offers a lot of bang for your buck.

For ointments and creams, I have tried desitin, vaseline, benadryl, aloe vera gel. Lately, I have been trying Lotrimin. But everything just provides temporary relief for a few hours before I need to apply again. It is keeping me up at night. I was referred to a general surgeon since he saw me before when I had hemorrhoid. He suggested that it could be anal fissures and gave me nifedipine which does nothing. The itching sometimes is also in the perianal area and mostly on the skin around the anus.

I also notice that the itching is more when I feel the area dryer than usual, or when I am walking and active. 

I am losing my mind over this and don’t know how to deal with this anymore. I have a bidet which helps when I sense an itch coming on, and ice helps a lot. But those are not accessible when I am at work. 

I have asked my doctor for a referral to a dermatologist and he said that this is not something that a dermatologist can solve.

1in1yyr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1in1yyr/is_this_the_best_pour_over_coffee_maker_stanley/,Is this the best pour over coffee maker? Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set review,"Testing coffee makers is practically a morning ritual for me. I’ve gone through a range of devices, from traditional drip machines to sleek espresso setups. Recently, I got my hands on the Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set in Hammertone Green, and I’ve been using it daily. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee, this pour-over set intrigued me with its reusable stainless steel filter and rugged design.

The first thing I noticed was its robust build. This thing looks like it could survive a camping trip in the wild or a tumble down the stairs. The Hammertone Green finish gives it a classic, outdoorsy vibe. It’s about 5.8 inches wide and nearly 9 inches tall, so it doesn’t take up much space. The set includes a matching mug, which is a thoughtful touch. While testing, I brewed coffee directly into the mug, but it’s compatible with other cups too, making it versatile.

Using the Stanley Camp Pour Over Set is straightforward. I added ground coffee to the stainless steel filter, poured hot water in a slow, circular motion, and let the magic happen. The stainless steel filter does its job well, allowing the aromatic oils and flavors to shine through without the need for disposable paper filters. Cleanup is quick, which is a huge plus when you’re groggy in the morning or in the middle of a camping trip.

[Check Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-pour-over-coffee-maker-stanley-review-b088jxmg3b/)

The pour-over set is easy to clean, and I appreciate the environmentally friendly aspect of the reusable filter. However, I noticed that fine coffee grounds sometimes sneak through the filter, so medium to coarse grounds work best. It’s not ideal for those who prefer finely ground coffee. Also, while the mug is sturdy, its size might not accommodate larger coffee cravings. For me, the 12-ounce mug was just enough for a single serving.

**Pros**

* Durable stainless steel construction that feels built to last.
* Reusable filter eliminates the need for paper filters, making it eco-friendly.
* Compact size and portability are perfect for camping or small kitchens.
* Easy to use with simple steps for a delicious cup of coffee.
* Quick to clean, making it convenient for daily or outdoor use.

**Cons**

* Fine coffee grounds may seep through the filter, so grind size matters.
* The included mug might be too small for those who prefer larger servings.
* Not the most space-efficient for backpacking; doesn’t nest or collapse.
* The coffee isn’t as hot as some might prefer if left to drip too long.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to other pour-over coffee makers like the Hario V60 or Chemex, the Stanley set stands out for its ruggedness and portability. The Hario V60, while excellent for at-home use, feels fragile in comparison and requires disposable filters. The Chemex produces a cleaner cup due to its thicker paper filters, but it’s bulkier and not something you’d want to lug around on a camping trip.

For camping enthusiasts, the Stanley set offers a simple, durable solution. That said, if you’re looking for something ultra-compact for backpacking, the collapsible GSI Outdoors Ultralight Java Drip might be a better choice. However, the GSI lacks the same sturdiness and aesthetic appeal as the Stanley.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The Stanley The Camp Pour Over Set is reasonably priced for what it offers. Its lifetime warranty is a testament to the brand’s confidence in its durability. When compared to pricier pour-over devices, you’re getting solid value here. The reusable filter saves money over time, especially if you’re someone who goes through stacks of paper filters. While it’s not as cheap as some basic plastic drippers, the quality and versatility justify the cost.

In my experience, this set is ideal for casual coffee drinkers, outdoor enthusiasts, or anyone who appreciates a durable, no-nonsense coffee maker. It’s not a perfect fit for everyone—fine coffee lovers or those with limited packing space might want to keep looking—but for many, it’s a reliable option.

1in1ybc,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1in1ybc/nespresso_service_disappointing_experience/,Nespresso Service Disappointing Experience,"# Disappointing Experience After 10 Years as a Customer

After ten years as a customer of this company and owning two coffee machines with a total value of 800 euros, I had an extremely disappointing experience with their service and customer support.

One of my machines developed a water leakage issue at its base. After contacting customer service, they advised me to purchase a new water tank and perform descaling again. I paid 15 euros for this, and the items were sent to my home. However, even after testing the machine with the new tank, the issue persisted.

I reached out to customer service again, and they told me I needed to send the machine in for inspection. I sent it and paid 60 euros for the repair. However, when I received it back, the problem remained unresolved. I informed them, and they requested that I send it again. This time, I personally delivered the machine to their store in Glyfada, where an employee received it without noting any visible damage. As ""compensation"" for my inconvenience up to that point, they gave me four coffee capsules.

# Damage During Service & Attempt to Shift Blame

About two weeks later, I received a phone call asking if I had ever dropped the machine, implying that the damage was my fault. Naturally, I told them that this had never happened and that when I handed it over at the store, their employee had inspected it and did not report any damage.

Shortly after, they called again to admit that the damage had actually occurred at their service center—the machine had fallen due to their mistake. They told me they would replace it at no cost, but the fact that they initially tried to shift the blame onto me was infuriating.

# Limited Replacement Options & Refusal to Refund My Money

After admitting the damage, they offered to replace the machine, stating that there were no available spare parts. Initially, they said I could choose a model worth up to 370 euros, but shortly after, they changed this to 330 euros.

I found a model worth 399 euros that I liked and that matched my kitchen aesthetically, offering to pay the 30-euro difference myself. However, they refused and only allowed me to choose from cheaper models worth 299 euros. Adding insult to injury, at one point, their representative mentioned, ""You already received free coffee capsules,"" as if four capsules made up for the hassle and financial loss I had incurred.

Additionally, when I requested a refund of the 60 euros I had paid for a repair that was never actually performed, they refused. In summary, I paid 60 euros for a repair that never happened, 15 euros for a water tank and descaling that didn't solve the issue, and in the end, instead of receiving a replacement machine of equal value, I was forced to accept a cheaper one.

# Total Loss

I originally paid 330 euros for my machine. In the end, I was given a machine worth 299 euros while also losing an additional 75 euros (60 euros for the service + 15 euros for the tank and descaling). Essentially, the actual value I received back was only 224 euros.

To ""make up for it,"" they offered me six extra coffee capsules, as if that somehow compensated for the money I lost.

# Conclusion

This experience was unacceptable and insulting as a long-time customer. Instead of receiving proper service and a solution to my problem, I had to fight to prove that I wasn’t responsible for the damage they caused. On top of that, I lost money and was forced to accept a lower-value machine.

After this experience, I cannot recommend this company to anyone. If this is how they treat a loyal customer, I can’t imagine how they handle newer customers or those with lower-value machines.",1,1739289708.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

the testing period starts tomorrow. I will be streaming my training sessions every day on twitch: 18:00 GMT ( EST) [twitch.tv/the867/schedule](http://twitch.tv/the867/schedule)

I will post the data collected each day and discuss the methodology of the test in a discord channel: [https://discord.gg/HykgEX7R](https://discord.gg/HykgEX7R)

**basic protocol:**

* fill an envelope with 7 placebo capsules and 7 caffeine+L-theanine capsules
* derust for a week
* every following day:
   * warm up for 15 minutes
   * ingest a random pill from the bag
   * train for 2 hours (with regular breaks)
   * measure miss count on select maps
   * record results in google sheets

To ensure the test is double blind, the capsules will be handled and ingested with eyes closed, and a picture will be taken to record the type dose for later. The caffeine capsules will contain pills of 50mg caffeine and 100mg L-theanine, and the placebo capsules will contain small chunks of cashew nut (to ensure they feel the same when shaken).

**control variables:**

in order to have accurate data, anything that could influence performance (the control variables) must be held constant.

* Sleep:
   * 7-8 hours sleep every day
   * shower morning ED
   * bedtime 24:00 to 01:00
   * wake up 07:00 to 09:00
* Exercise:
   * 1-2 km morning run ED (every day)
   * no other exercise during testing period
* Nutrition:
   * 2 meals a day
   * 50g granola breakfast ED
   * lunch and dinner of balanced nutritional value
   * no other caffeine (e.g. coffee, tea)
* Dopamine:
   * no gooning
   * 30 mins tiktok morning ED (goggins algorithm)
   * 30 mins reels after training ED (car crash+darius algorithm)
   * no youtube, no youtube shorts
   * discord when needed
   * music 30 mins max
   * no screens after 24:00

**limitations of the test:**

this test may not generalize to some areas of the osu player population.

* test only includes one participant, so effects for others may vary based on individual affinity for caffeine
* participant is:
   * performing regular exercise, eating healthily, washing regularly
   * limiting social media consumption
   * trying to get better at the game (not playing for fun)
   * cisgender caucasian male, 19
   * a purely occasional consumer of caffeinated substances (50mg caffeine pills a couple times a month, tea a couple times a week)
* these attributes may not be shared by other players, so the results of this test will not support excessive extrapolation to cases that reside outside of the bounds set by these attributes. At the same time, arguments that the test results don't extrapolate do not deny the conclusion that the individual in the test improves/doesn't improve/gets worse with caffeine. Moderate liberties in extrapolation should be granted.
* test only evaluates aim, not other areas such as stamina, tech, flow aim, reading, memorization. Aim was chosen primarily because it is the easiest metric to test, and at least plays a foundational part in most other valued osu skills.

I would appreciate any help from the comments. here are the things I need:

* good aim maps to use (aim training or just jump spam)
* one of the osu statistics prodigies to verify the method

**osu statistics people read this, because I need your input**

I will be looking for results that satisfy a 10% significance level (aka p<0.1). 5% is standard for medical studies, and im just a chill guy so there is a little extra leeway.

**This means that there will be a 1 in 10 chance that the conclusion of this test will be incorrect.**

* This sounds outrageously unreliable, but for professional medical studies it is still 1 in 20, and for drug trials it is 1 in 100 (and I am just one guy).
* if someone else repeats this test and both tests have the same outcome, there is a 1 in 100 chance that both reject the wrong hypothesis.
* if someone else repeats this test (at the same significance level) and attains a different outcome, idk what statistical significance this has. google says just conduct more research and do a meta analysis.
* the p-value holds no more significance past the fact of whether or not it lies within the critical region. aka no copium like ""wow so small must be more significant than 10% level"" or ""cry harder it was literally 0.0999/0.1001"". **The significance level has been declared before the test has started (based loosely on the quality of the test), so if its in its in, if its out its out.** I encourage the community to reject findings where the significance level has not been declared before the outset of the test, has been changed during/after the test, and obviously to reject any purely anecdotal conclusions (e.g. sytho copium)
* inb4 ""they've done studies on-"" no they haven't. the closest thing to osu they've done a study on is csgo, and while they have found positive correlation with performance, I would argue that while one can convincing extrapolate from csgo to valorant, the same cannot be done for osu. An argument can be made has just as much in common with playing an instrument as it has with csgo. But regardless, hypothesis testing will always be a superior method to semantic extrapolation and arguing over how close in nature two different tasks are.
* I express a clickbait opinion in the title, but really I am impartial to the results of this test, and I myself take caffeine pills for a variety of tasks. I suspect some kind of difference in performance, but if that difference isn't drastic enough to show in a 10% confidence interval over a two week test then I would raise the question of whether its worth the money to buy these pills, the withdrawals if you use them too much, and the time the substance takes up in the spotlight of performance enhancing methods.

**I am currently unsure of the appropriate hypothesis test to use. My two lines of thinking are:**

* take the mean of each group and perform a t-test
   * i expect significant improvement throughout the testing period so a mean value of the group may not representative of the individual values
   * improvement could be corrected for with something like curve fitting, but it sounds dodgy. i don't know how to describe it, but its like you're using the information in the data too early.
* rank the data and calculate spearman's rank correlation coefficient
   * rank may be an issue because of a case like having 3 placebos in a row in the last 3 days, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the criteria of the test
   * random order of pills could be verified to be uniform by a third party but that kinda defeats the purpose of random
   * protocol could be changed to take caffeine every other day, but withdrawal effects may influence the integrity of the test
   * problem goes away as testing period increases, but two weeks is already a pretty long time

I am open to any better ideas on hypothesis testing or test methodology. I also encourage anyone who's interested in repeating my method to do so, but to maintain not necessarily the same control variables, but at least the same level of rigour (so as to be in a position to challenge/corroborate with my findings).

I will return with my results in 2-3 weeks time.",5,1739289663.0,osugame,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Long time watcher and finally decided to share a story with everyone. Sorry if this is long, but I'll try to keep it short and the tangents to a minimum. Names have been changed to protect those involved.

Me (30F, goes by V) and my husband Red (38M) went to wedding last summer that I've been dying to talk about to someone. A couple were friends with (Kayce (32M) and Monica (31F)) got married at an outdoor wedding in June out in the Texas hill country. 

For some backstory, Monica and I don't really get along very well. She's kind of the typical mean girl towards me (snide comments and my clothes, hair, weight, cooking, house etc) unless it'll benefit her. I have a lot of different hobbies. I do nature photography because where we live is stunning to me, I also love to bake, and play guitar in my very limited spare time. I also used to dye my own hair. 

Any time I mentioned any of these things, she would immediately either berate me or ask me to do whatever it was for her wedding. She wanted me to make 8 dozen cookies the day before the wedding, I said that I just wouldn't have time. She wanted me to dye her hair for her, I told her that because I'm not a licensed hairdresser, I didn't feel comfortable doing that. She wanted me to write and play a new song for her and Kayce, I'm not a song writer. She wanted me to do the photography for the wedding, I said ""Ok. I'll draw up the contract and get the cost figured out"". She blew up on me, saying it could be ""My gift to her"". I laughed in her face. This was over several months 

Kayce had told us he wanted to start a handyman business. He's really good at fixing things, and it would be a good side hustle. Red and I have a truck with a service bed on it, but the motor is locked up. Kayce had mentioned how he would love to replace the motor and buy the truck from us. We talked it over and decided that we would just give him the truck, let him keep it at our place while he's working on it, and put the title in an envelope with his name on it so it didn't get mixed up with other paperwork we have.

Over the next several months were bombarded with wedding stuff from them. They didn't even both to text Red and I when we got married, but we needed to care about their wedding. She brags to me about how much they're spending (her dress cost $2500.) while degrading me (I bought mine off the rack at a western wear store for $65). Every time she would complain, Kayce would make a joke about just having a courthouse wedding. She would shriek like a banshee about courthouse weddings being trashy. In my house. In front of me. Who loved my ""trashy"" courthouse wedding. 

Red also gets asked to be a back up groomsman, as many people on the grooms side would be coming from out of state. Red was honored to be asked, and even more so when he got bumped up to groomsman. I was happy for him, but I really didn't want to go. After all the negative attitude from Monica, I wanted to just save the money and stay home. Monica also invited me to her bachelorette weekend but firmly said I wasn't in the bridal party by saying ""I don't want fat bridesmaids"" and then letting it slip that the more girls who went, the cheaper it would be. I have pretty bad social anxiety, and Red is kinda like my safety blanket, so being away from him for a weekend around a bunch of women I don't know, with Monica constantly talking down to me sounded like a nightmare. I said I'd think about it to be polite and forgot. 3 months later she put me in a group chat and asked about my deposit. I firmly said that I wasn't comfortable going, and would have to skip but I hope they have fun. I got a ""Whatever"" in response.

Things of that nature continued for months until right before the wedding. We boarded our dogs, packed up our stuff and made the 3 and a half hour drive to the venue. There would be accommodations on the ""Boutique Ranch"" they had rented out. There's a lot of these places in the hill country because it's a popular wedding and vacation area, but I think they're cheesy. Whatever, not my money. Kayce had also promised we wouldn't have to share a room with anyone after Monica kept saying the groomsmen could all stay in one room and that I could ""Figure it out"". Well we get there, and Monica ignores me completely, with her swarm of harpies (the bridesmaids) following behind her. When I tried to say hi and figure out where we were sleeping, she gave me a look that screamed ""I don't care, I don't want you here anyway"" and just walked off without saying anything to me. 

I ended up finding Kayce and the other groomsmen and hanging out with them. I got a long really well with them as I grew up primarily around men so I feel more comfortable around guys, plus I could be near Red, and Kayce is one of my best friends. Hours go by and we're all partying together. The harpies locked themselves in the bridal suite doing whatever they were doing. At this time Red and I told Kayce what our gift was. He was thrilled we were giving him the truck but Monica flipped out in front of everyone about how she didn't want ""that stupid ugly truck"" and basically screamed it in my face. I just walked outside along with Red and the best man (Travis, I guess. Sticking with the Yellowstone names haha). We're standing around smoking and talking about her freak out when out she comes. She rips into Travis about how he should be on her side because he's in her wedding. We all just stare at her and she storms back off. 

A little while later, she plastered. Travis, Red and I are also pretty drunk but we were playing a card game and just relaxing. Red made a joke about Travis staring at my chest. We're pretty opened about a lot of things, and the most we'll do is tease someone when we catch them. Kayce and Monica are pretty similar to us in the regards that things like nudity aren't a big deal. Travis is kind of sheltered and not used to people like us, so we were making jokes to get a blush out of him, but kept it at that. Upon hearing the joke, Monica rushed over and go on a rant about how skinny girls are so much hotter than fat sluts like me, and proceeded to flash her mosquito bites at us like it's spring break on Daytona Beach. I've finally had enough and start laughing. ""What's so funny V?"" She lowered her shirt sounding very confused. I basically said that most guys prefer a woman with a figure that doesn't remind them of the lumber section at Home Depot. She looked at Travis, because she knows Red will side with me. He agrees he likes curvier women. She stomps off and we continue our game.

Around like 2:30am, we're all winding down and looking to call it for the night. I go grab our bags out of the car because we never found out where we were sleeping. Low and behold, we're sharing a room with Travis and another groomsman. The other guy said he had been promised a solo room too because he doesn't want his CPAP machine to keep people up. He says he's just gonna sleep on the couch in the common room because no one else was out there. We told him it was fine, and insisted he stayed, but he still left to sleep on the couch. I felt really bad, but when I saw him in the morning, he said he slept great.

When I woke up the next day, I made a breakfast run into town and got the best hangover food a drive thru can offer, and the biggest coffees I could find too. I get back, we take turns showering and start getting ready. 5 hours before the wedding, bridesmaids start calling Red and Travis saying Monica needs them for pictures. So, I'm alone to pack up and finish getting ready. 3 hours later, I'm ready to go, bags are packed up and in the car, and I go down to where the ceremony is gonna take place. I find the groom and groomsmen and we start just hanging out again. Red was floored because I don't get all dolled up very often, and I definitely don't wear heels very often haha. I was politely shooed off by the photographer they hired (I was shocked they actually hired someone) for the grooms side photos. After they were done, it was the whole wedding party, bride and groom, family, etc.

Finally, we start taking seats for the wedding. I wasn't even allowed to pin the boutonniere on Red, but the bridesmaids who had partners as groomsmen were allowed to. Red and Travis pinned them to each other. The ceremony goes fine. Afterwards I go up to Kayce and Monica, tell them the ceremony was beautiful, tell Monica she looked beautiful, and all the other pleasantries a guest is expected to make. Monica got in one last jab at me by saying ""You actually look nice too"". Kayce looked upset at that, and Red and I said our goodbyes to everyone. We left right after the ceremony and made that long drive home because Red couldn't get the day after the wedding off, and had to work.

Months later we rarely see Monica. Kayce is still a common face at our house, working on his truck and just hanging out with us. I still sometimes talk to Travis, but the whole fiasco of the wedding party night has become a joke to Red and I. They're still going strong, and I'm happy for them.

Sorry for the length, but this really is the condensed version of the story. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments for extra context.

1in1uk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TastefulCoffee/comments/1in1uk2/hamilton_beach_80350rv_coffee_grinder_review/,Hamilton Beach 80350RV Coffee Grinder Review: Small Yet Mighty for Coffee and More,"My mornings have always been a race against the clock, but grinding fresh coffee beans with the Hamilton Beach 80350RV Coffee Grinder has become a small ritual I genuinely enjoy. The grinder doesn’t just sit on my counter looking pretty; it earns its keep every day. While it has its quirks, this little powerhouse has become my go-to for freshly brewed coffee and even grinding spices for recipes.

The design caught my eye immediately. The sleek silver finish and compact size make it a subtle addition to my kitchen without hogging counter space. It’s surprisingly lightweight, weighing just over a pound, which makes it easy to stash away when not in use. The stainless steel grinding bowl is removable, a feature I appreciate more than I initially thought I would. It feels durable and has stood up to constant use without losing its shine. However, the plastic lid feels a bit flimsy. I’ve been extra cautious with it after reading about potential breakage issues.

[Check Hamilton Beach 80350RV price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/hamilton-beach-80350rv-coffee-grinder-review-b0082hpsfu/)

Grinding performance has been a mixed bag. On one hand, the stainless steel blades do a fantastic job tackling coffee beans, spices, and even flax seeds. On the other hand, consistency is where it falters. While grinding for my French press, I noticed it’s difficult to achieve an even coarse texture. Some beans turn into powder, while others remain half-ground. Timing the pulses carefully helps, but it doesn’t entirely solve the issue.

Operating the grinder couldn’t be simpler. It’s a one-button operation: press to grind, release to stop. But here’s the catch: getting the lid to align perfectly with the base can be a bit of a puzzle. I’ve had moments where I twisted and turned it multiple times just to get it to lock properly. Once it’s in place, though, the grinding process is quick and efficient.

The capacity is modest, grinding enough beans for up to 12 cups of coffee. Realistically, this means about 4-5 servings for someone who enjoys a stronger brew. The grinding speed is impressive, especially for such a compact machine. Within seconds, my kitchen fills with the aroma of freshly ground coffee—a smell that no pre-ground coffee can replicate.

**Pros**

* Compact and lightweight with a sleek silver finish.
* Removable stainless steel grinding bowl for easy cleaning.
* Quick grinding process with durable stainless steel blades.
* Multipurpose use for coffee beans, spices, and seeds.
* Cord storage keeps counters tidy.

**Cons**

* Inconsistent grind sizes, especially for coarse grinds.
* Flimsy plastic lid prone to breakage.
* Lid alignment can be tricky and frustrating.
* Noise level is higher than expected.
* Limited capacity for larger households or batch grinding.

Comparing this grinder to its competitors, the Hamilton Beach 80350RV certainly holds its ground in terms of price and simplicity. For example, the Krups F203 is another blade grinder in the same price bracket, and it offers slightly better consistency but lacks the removable bowl feature. On the higher end, burr grinders like the Baratza Encore provide unparalleled precision and grind uniformity, but they’re significantly more expensive and bulkier. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option with multipurpose functionality, the Hamilton Beach grinder is a solid choice, albeit with some compromises.

From a cost perspective, this grinder is affordable and offers decent value for its price. However, for those who prioritize grind consistency or need a quieter machine, spending a bit more on a burr grinder may be worth it.

One feature I genuinely like is the dishwasher-safe grinding bowl. Most of my previous grinders required tedious cleaning with a brush, but here, I can just pop the bowl in the dishwasher and be done with it. The hidden cord storage is another small but thoughtful detail; it keeps my counters clutter-free and reduces the hassle of dealing with tangled cords.

Would I recommend this grinder? That depends on what you’re looking for. If you’re a casual coffee drinker or someone who enjoys experimenting with spices and seeds, this grinder does the job without breaking the bank. However, if you’re a coffee connoisseur who demands precision, you might want to consider investing in a burr grinder instead.

Naging friends kami dahil sa church and naging jowa sya ng 3rd cousin ko(or tito?) na kasama rin namin sa church. Super close kami and that was more than 5 yrs ago. Kinekwento lahat sa’kin and I really treated her like a little sister. Since then puro lalaki na problema nya - from the time na she was dating my relative to his boy rn. I used to find that cute and normal since she was at that age pero now, it’s a no. 

For context, her first boy was my relative. Syempre bata pa sya that time, tatanga tanga. Iiyak iyak sa’min kasi nasasaktan and niloloko. Kami naman mag aadvise, tutulungan. We understood na bata pa, di pa maiwasan mga di magandang decisions and nababaliw pa sa lalaki pero di kami nagkulang sa paalala. 

Next guy was a student na manggagawa (yes, inc. if student pa yan, super bawal). Pinagsabihan namin about that, matigas ulo. Marami kaming naririnig about the guy, pero yung guy lang pinaniniwalaan nya. Again, umiiyak samin. Ilang beses niloko. Nabaliw na naman sa lalaki. Since nasa ministeryo nga yung guy, di rin namin maiiwasan kasi lagi rin naman nakakasama. Sinasabihan din namin yung guy about their situation kasi ayaw din namin sila mapahamak both. I had a boyfriend that time and we just broke up. Nalaman netong bf ng friend ko and talked to me. I think he was kinda trying to comfort me then out of nowhere, sabi nya sakin if may alam daw ba akong place na tahimik para mapag usapan yung feelings ko kasi galing break ako. So sabi ko we can go coffee sa antips WITH MY FRIEND. Tapos sabi kami lang daw and nagtatanong sya ano raw ginagawa namin ng ex ko (about sex). Iniiba ko usapan then sabi nya baka pwede raw sya i-bj. I rejected him of course and di ko na kinausap ever. Sinabi ko yung sa friend ko na gf nya and syempre and kampi ay nasa bf nya. Hinayaan ko na. Nawalan na ako nang gana sa friend ko na yan. I just heard na they broke up and di natuloy wedding nila because of cheating. 

Now, recently nalaman ko na nakikipaglandian sya sa other friend ko (m27) na bagong break. My friend is really serious sa kanya and umamin sakin na sila na pala last year pero dinedeny sya samin ni girl. Found out she’s talking to multiple guys including her ex (the one na di natuloy wedding). I told my friend na dinedeny sya and nagalit sakin. 


That girl gave up her studies kasi expecting sya na pakakasalan sya nung manggagawa sa inc. Now, she’s unemployed, pabigat and hanggang ngayon, boy problems pa rin.

Café Bustelo makes a Nespresso-compatible original line aluminum pod, and I’ve tried a bit to replicate a true Cuban coffee (short of espresso, with creamed Demerara sugar).

Problem is, in the traditional method, you use a moka pot, and use a tiny bit of the coffee (before it’s done brewing) to pour into the sugar, then you work/stir that into a paste, then eventually into a blonde sort of smooth, foamy *crema*. Last thing you do is pour your coffee into the *crema*, and enjoy.

But with the Nespresso prep, you can’t really get a first bit off of your espresso. When you pull a full shot, it gets a little too old, and its natural crema dies before you can add it to the sugar.

It’s good, but it’s just not quite the same.

So, have any of you found a way around this, shy of sacrificing an entire first shot to make a second perfect one?

1. Hotels App - Ive been using the CAD sight mostly but discovered flipping to USD site can be difference of $10-20 per night. 
2. Google Search Area - some hotels don't list with Expedia but use bookings.com so you may see a hotel next door. Google uses unethical marketing to change your dates to give you something 3 weeks away so it looks cheaper so you book incorrect dates. 
4. Check Brand Websites- Wyndham / Days Inn/ Choice. Some give you cheaper rates just by signing into being ""a member "" aka join their membership spam list. One example I had was $75 US per night on hotels but $55 US via direct booking. 
5. Franchising hotel owners- if you're speaking to the owners they can add discounts. Note general night staff can't due to their system restrictions.

I was so excited when I first got my machine. I sat and practiced with the mask like they recommended, and it was so relaxing and OMG so easy to breath, and I got so sleepy. Third time I did that I just let myself nod off and had the best nap. The first couple of nights weren't so easy -- lots of leaking, hard to get comfortable, didn't sleep full nights, BUT I woke up and I didn't go through this thing that's been happening for years, which is I wake up and struggle to get a full sized breath of air, and it takes a couple minutes of sitting up in bed and pulling hard to fill my lungs as much as I can before I can breath easy again. Even though I didn't sleep well, right away I woke up and my lungs filled, just like that, from my first awake breath.

  
I KNOW this will help me if I can just manage to sleep with it. I've been on it for 3 weeks now, and had 2 naps that felt good, and one night of sleep that felt as good as what's been normal for the last few year. Oh, yeah. That's the night I went ""I can't take this anymore"" and didn't use the mask. And woke up with the old thing of struggling to pull enough air into my lungs. 

I've read all the tips from the manual and the apps. Watched all their videos. Tried everything they recommended (most of which I didn't need them to tell me I was already trying.) In the calibration study they gave me the **nasal** mask which was obvious it wasn't going to work long term but they got what they needed. When I actually got my equipment, I went for the resmed (resmed was all they offered) **F40 ""Pillows""** one. Truly comfy as long as I was sitting up. Also comfy mask-wise lying on my back, but I've been a side sleeper my whole life because lying on my back causes so much back pain. I got a feather pillow because I figure that's infinitely adjustable (I had one growing up and loved it.) It helped, but still no full nights' sleep. And so much irritations from it being shoved against the bottom of my nose that I couldn't stand to wear it, but nothing else would stop the leaks. Or if it's not leaking, half the time I feel like the nose holes are lining up and it's actually harder to breath.

I want to the **F40** **Full Face**. It's uncomfortable but seemed more stable. It's made the bridge of my nose really sore (jamming the top against my nose was the only way to keep it from leaking. I had to adjust the straps in a weird way that's not was was intended to even get that to happen.) And there's overlap with the sore place and where my glasses sit, so that's great. But I hoped. 

Then finally, last night, magic happened. It took 2+ hours (as my spouse will testify), but finally I got in a place where I was comfortable enough to fall asleep and nothing was leaking. I woke up at 5:30 this morning comfortable and no leaks. After bathroom I went back to bed since I didn't actually get to sleep until after 11:00, and didn't bother to put it back on because it was only going to be a couple hours at the most before I got up for real.

But after my first cup of coffee when I'd expect to start feeling refreshed if I slept well (and sadly I'm still feeling beat up), I looked at my stats and it says I only used it for 4.5 hours last night. Since it was on my face from 9:00 pm to 5:30 am... it must have leaked. What else would it  turn off by itself. And I was comfortable and thinking it wasn't leaking because the air wasn't even on.

At this point, I'm practically in tears right now, have cried from being tired and frustrated, yelled at my dad something awful (on the phone) when he did nothing wrong, and my life has been so much worse these last 2 weeks than at any time in the past 3 years. I realize 3 weeks isn't a long time, but it's hard to keep one's hope up while being so sleep deprived.

 My ex and I were together for just under three years when she abruptly ended things, with what seemed like bogus reasons. Reasons I absolutely wanted to talk about and try and work through. We never faught, we never disagreed on anything. We had so many of the same interests, movies, comedy, video games, and a bunch of other nerdy stuff. 

The love I had for this women was the realest I'd ever felt. I had been there for her after she went silent for a few weeks because she couldn't immediately talk to me about the abortion she had (would have been mine, I think). I had been there after she went silent for a few weeks because she couldn't immediately talk to me about being diagnosed with breast cancer. I had been there for her the other half a dozen times she went silent for various, less severe reasons. She repeatedly praised my patience in dealing with her. I was so head over heels in love with her, she didn't even have to ask for forgiveness for ghosting, but she always did, and I always forgave. 

This all started in late August of 2024. I had just spent the night at her place and had woke up to get ready for work. She was asleep still because she had recently started working nights as a bartender after leaving her corporate job. I got dressed, kissed her on her forehead and told her I loved her. Not knowing at the time, that would be the last time I ever saw her. Over the next seven days she was really distant. She told me that her phone was broke. Then she 'lost' her phone for two days. Then she said she felt really alone and wasn't getting what she needed out of anyone. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it. No. I asked her if there was anything I could do for her. No. I told her I was sorry, that I love her, and just want to support her. No response.

On September 1st she sent me a very long message. She went into how she didn't feel like a priority in my life. How she wanted to talk more and spend more time together. How she had called a twice while leaving the bar late at night when she was afraid, and I missed her calls. How it felt like the video games I play in my spare time were more of a priority than she was. 

It was odd to me at the time that this was the first I was hearing about any of these things with the exception of spending more time together. Which I started spending more weeknights with her, trying to work around her bartender schedule. I wanted to talk about these things, I wanted her, I wanted to be there for her. 

Then, nothing. Complete silence from her. I assumed this was another of those times where she needed to be alone, and would eventually talk to me when she felt comfortable doing so. So I waited. The days turned into weeks, weeks to months. I was gradually losing my mind. I wondered why a person that had said they loved me thousands of times would not want to talk. I knew my depression, that I had been living with since I was diagnosed with it when I was young, took over my mind. I cried, and I thought about ending myself multiple times a day. I let my mind wander about why, and what she was doing. 

On November 8th, I was at a really low point. I sat on my couch and stared at the pistol on my coffee table. I stared at it for hours. I cried. I was completely done. But then I started thinking about who that would hurt, the mess that would need cleaned, the bills that would need paid, and who would have to deal with all that. Needless to say, I didn't do it. I decided instead to send her a text detailing how I loved her but was afraid for my life. How I needed to believe that she just didn't love me anymore and that officially I was breaking up with her. 

Three days later I got a response. It was about how my text got switched to an mms text and she couldn't read it. That she missed me and loved me. But also that the cancer was back, and how she didn't expect anyone to come along for the ride. 

I responded with how I was on the verge of ending myself because of how much it hurt missing her and not knowing what was going on. How i needed it to end so I could finally have peace. How if she couldn't even talk to me then we shouldn't be in a relationship together. And again zero response, as I expected. I didn't even want to touch on the cancer thing, because I didn't know if it was even true or if she even really wanted to talk about it. 

The relief was almost immediate. I felt like I had just taken off a hundred pound backpack. I could finally breathe. I missed her and still loved her but realized if she couldn't communicate, then I couldn't work to be better. I wanted to be better for her, but couldn't put myself through hell waiting for her to communicate. It seemed like maybe I was in the last chapter of the best love story of my life. It hurt but I thought I understood.

On January 9th, I was still missing her so I decided to check her fb page to see if there was anything new in her world. I'd done this probably every few days because honestly, I still was in love with her. When I get to her profile, the first thing a see is she is in a relationship with some other guy. My heart dropped and I clicked on his profile. I scroll through this guy's page all the way back to late August, when she was reacting to this guy's posts, followed shortly by pictures of them together, seemingly happy just days after she stopped talking to me. Seeing all these times they shared as I was clueless and going through hell. I was shaking at my desk, and having a complete mental breakdown. 

Completely broken, I asked and was given permission to leave for the day. Do you know how embarrassing it is to be looked at as a manly guy that cried at work? I didn't know what to do, or how to process any of these emotions. I wanted to just walk out to my car, grab my concealed carry pistol that was locked up and just put a bullet through my brain right there. I decided on going home, grabbing the box of stuff, everything I had ever received from her and drive them to her work to give them back and maybe get an explanation. I drove past her bar three times and decided that I couldn't go in. It would have been too awkward. So instead I parked at a close by gas station, cried, and chainsmoked for the next two hours. I tried calling and texting but got no answer. I knew then that I could never love this woman again. 

After a few weeks of dealing with the second worst emotional pain I've ever had to deal with, I decided to reach out and ask for closure. Heck, I begged her for closure. And to my surprise she responded! She said she would call in a few hours. Days past by and I got nothing. Finally I had realized how I felt exactly like when she would give me the silent treatment, and I broke again. I sent her about 15 text messages through fb messenger in under a few minutes. I expressed how much i had loved her. How much i used to respect her. How much all of this hurt. How much i had sacrificed for her. How I had to now question every aspect of our relationship and what else she had not told me. How much it hurt that I couldn't even get an honest explanation from her. She finally responded with more lies and half truths. How I had never bought her and her kids groceries or done their laundry. Finally I begged her to block me from her on fb and to have her now boyfriendblock me too. I confessed that his pfp of them together haunted me. I just wanted it to end. 

I know i screwed up on a few things. I know I wanted to work with her through them. I know that it's completely over and I'll never see or hear from her again. 

So finally, how do I get my brain to stop thinking about the pain? If I'm alone, or not at work, it's the only thing I think of. How do I process, that days after she told me she loved me that she was seeing someone else, that everything we had together,  she decided i wasnt wotrth it? How can I ever trust a woman again? How do i let myself ever being that vulnerable again?

I need to put this somewhere, so hello Reddit

I am going to try putting this is an easy readable chronological order. 

To be fair I didn’t really wanna celebrate my birthday with family because I just don’t like it, but do it for them, the family. So few days ago i “celebrated” my birthday with my family. I’m 25 male living with my parents in my own room that’s separate from their house (for economical and private reasons). 

It was a Sunday and we have certain rules. One of them is that I cook on Sunday. So I got out of bed early and came inside the house. (I don’t have my own shower) The first thing i was told, was not happy birthday, but that i stink, need to cut my hair, and that i need to put on some fancy clothes (which they know i hate). It’s my birthday for fucks sake, there’s that one uncle that also hates fancy clothes. He always wears normal clothing to birthdays, but I may not do the same on my own? Uncle is mother’s brother by the way. 

I know my mom is reading some sort of “trauma process book”. But everything she reads a book, it’s like only that book exists and everyone should do the same things as her. She told me I didn’t take a shower yesterday, I say just because nobody was home (I have a key), doesn’t mean that I don’t shower. She dit not accept that answer and I had to point to her where I laid my towel to dry. 

She is usually not like this, but I’m starting to hate that book and I didn’t even read it. 

After having cooked and eaten I went back to my place to tidy some more things up, like sweep the floor. 

First member comes in, leaves a bag. I wanted to say hello but she was already gone again. My sister made the cake so I waited until she was there too, at this point (about 15 minutes since the first person came in). And I live in a small space so 12 persons and a baby is getting pretty crowded pretty quickly. 

I was glad that my sisters wanted to help, because I am clueless about social stuff at birthdays and who drinks what. I don’t drink alcohol nor coffee. So I don’t have that. Then again my parents wanted me to buy a coffee machine so visitors of my can drink coffee. I’m like, I don’t drink coffee, none of my friends drink coffee, why should i pay for a coffee machine and it’s pads, cups or whatever just to satisfy YOUR addiction. The only people I know who drink coffee, are my colleagues who I’m not close with and said family members who visit my only at my birthday whether I like it or not. One family member is sensitive to alcoholism so I don’t buy that anyway. 

Besides, where should I put the thing? My kitchen has a sink, oven and an induction plate and if I step aside, I am standing next to my bed. 

Back to the birthday, I had put some tasty things on the table, like chips and nuts. They constantly told me it was not going to be enough but at the and of the day, there was much left over. Some people wanted tea, I put some tea out and those little dishes for underneath it. Nobody cared and put the wet teabags on my wooden table. The said table was now full of drinks and people walked against it about 5 times, the sixth time I kinda snapped and just told them to look out. Because of the carpet underneath. I don’t want coke in my white carpet. My mom saw this and basically told me to fuck off (not her exact words). I was busy handing out drinks, i stand still for 2 seconds to drink something myself and get yelled at for not doing anything. 

Remember the first person? The one with the bag. Yeah she was mad angry because she didn’t get a slice of cake before anyone else, because she got here first. 

And then i was tired. I tried to get them away so I could go to bed, if I’m tired, talking costs me more energy than running. But then again, I was told to smile more. It was fucking almost the middle of the night and I have work the next day. 



And more of such annoying and irritating things happened that day and I have to fight very hard not to fall back into a depression I had a few years back. It reminds my of a “birthday” party i had years ago. People were enjoying the party, but they didn’t even notice me. I went to bed and nobody cared. 

It feels like I’m forgetting something. I’ll edit the post if I think of it. ",1,1739288332.0,rant,0,1.0,False

I love my boyfriend. I know without a shadow of a doubt, he is the man I want to spend my life with. We communicate better than I could ever have imagined possible. My therapist who I see privately even says she is amazed on how well the two of us handle conflict and how deeply we communicate. He is kind and caring and overall the most amazing human I have ever met. For the story's sake, let's call my boyfriend ""P."" 

In the last couple months our sex has decreased and we haven't had sex in almost a month. 

The first time in our relationship that the sex stopped after a few deep conversations P disclosed to me that he is having trouble having sex with me because his mind thinks of the abuse that I endured in my last relationship. Before I met P, I had survived horrible domestic violence. For community guidelines I won't go into it, but it was the kind of stuff they censor on Dateline TV. P said that when we get intimate and he gets aroused he feels so guilty. He feels guilty that men in general can use their sexual urges to hurt people and he can't get the icky out of his head that someone could look at a wonderful girl like me and want to harm her. In P's defense I so regret telling him details of my abuse.

P has never hurt me. He has NEVER raised his voice, nor even made any jokes that I think are wrongly normalized. My therapist says he's a green flag. He doesn't watch porn, because he says that it's possible porn could have a nonconcenting party and he couldnt get aroused to the idea of someone getting hurt.

I love P. Not to mention I also think he is the most attractive man I have ever seen. I am so amazed that even after the abuse I went through that I'd ever want to be intimate again, much less could I imagine how much I want P all the time. And when I say I really want him, I really really want him. And, I don't have a drive without him either I don't want to do anything alone, it's just him that does it for me.

We talked the other day about why we haven't had sex. He said he wouldn't care if we ever did again because sex to him is so unimportant in a relationship that he would rather do something else meaningful like a puzzle, go out to dinner, or cuddle. He tells me he still thinks I'm the most beautfiul woman and he still is attracted to me. Our intimacy hasn't died either, I still am held close very night, kissed, and hugged. He makes my coffee every morning. 

After my abuse and past experiences, I find it hard to believe a man wouldn't want sex all the time. Society even jokes ""a man wants one thing."" I will say, I live with P and we both work from home, I know he isn't cheating. He's honest and I have not a single suspicion that cheating is going on. 

P says he feels broken for not having a raging drive like you see in movies. He says he has never in previous relationships had much of a drive either.

I am honored to be loved for my mind. To be cherished for who I am. I wouldn't change P at all. I just want to know, did I destroy him when I told him my story or are there many men out there who just don't really care about sex? And advice on how to get him to want penetrative sex again?

Ps. When I posted this somewhere else I was advised to find someone more sexually compatible. To which I will say, I'd stay with P if he was amputated from the waist down. I love him.

I started having issues with POTs a year ago and they found some issues with my kidneys, but nothing more was said about that. Fast forward, I started having blurry vision about 4-5 months ago, extreme fatigue, dry skin, neuropathy outside of my normal neuropathy (I have nerve pain from fibromyalgia). Any way - kept getting told it's likely my fibromyalgia and with winter dry skin to be expected.

I told them to check my blood sugar, she said it's unlikely that, but she would check my blood panel and sugars - which then lead to the A1C1 check and bam - 8.7. No history of pred-diabetes, only risk factor for me is my weight. Fast forward 3 months to this week - had my 3 month check - my A1C1 is down to 5.8! 

I tried metformin, but could not tolerate it. I was put on mounjaro 2 months ago which has helped immensely with food cravings and food noise. I've cut out almost all sugar (but do occasionally induldge in some dark chocolate or a small candy). I cut back a lot on my carb intake (bread (I am gluten sensitive so this was easier for me as I don't eat many as it is), and cut out my normal iced coffee and replaced it with a premier protein caffe latte shake. I'm down about 10lbs, but me it's more about the sugar than the weight. 

TLDR - A1C1 went from 8.7 --> 5.8 in 3 months with help of mounjaro, dietary changes, and lifestyle changes. Huzzah!",3,1739288064.0,diabetes_t2,0,1.0,False
1in1a19,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1in1a19/the_door_that_shouldnt_exist_part_1/,The Door That Shouldn't Exist - Part 1,"I moved into this house three months ago. It was cheap—suspiciously cheap—but the landlord said the previous owner had moved suddenly, leaving everything behind. I should have known that was a red flag. But when you're desperate, you overlook things. You convince yourself that luck exists, that maybe you just stumbled onto a deal too good to pass up. And when you’re in a situation like mine, you don’t ask too many questions. You tell yourself that every abandoned home has a story, and it’s not your place to dig too deeply into why someone left in such a hurry.

At first, I was grateful for the opportunity. The house was bigger than anything I could have afforded otherwise, with beautiful wooden floors, high ceilings, and intricate crown molding. It was the kind of place that hinted at a storied past, a life well-lived before it was left behind. I imagined what kind of people had once called this house home, their laughter echoing through its halls, their voices imprinting on the walls like echoes trapped in time.

But something about the silence here unsettled me. It wasn’t the peaceful stillness I had expected—it was deeper, heavier, an emptiness that felt unnatural. At first, I chalked it up to new-house jitters, the discomfort of adjusting to an unfamiliar space. But the feeling never quite went away. It clung to the air, thick and suffocating, a presence just beyond the realm of perception.

Strange things started happening. The lights would flicker, sometimes in rhythmic patterns that seemed deliberate, though I told myself it was just faulty wiring. I would hear faint noises in the night—soft creaks and distant whispers, the kind you can almost convince yourself are just the house settling. Items moved, not drastically, but just enough to make me doubt myself. A book slightly out of place, a chair shifted ever so slightly, the blanket at the foot of my bed folded differently than I had left it. Small things, insignificant on their own, but together, they began to form a pattern I couldn’t ignore.

Then there were the dreams—vivid, unsettling. In them, I wasn’t alone. Shadows stretched unnaturally across the floor, voices whispered just beyond comprehension, and the sensation of something watching me was so intense that I often woke up drenched in sweat, gasping for breath. It was as though something had followed me out of sleep, lingering in the dark corners of my room, just beyond the reach of the light.

And yet, despite the gnawing unease, I stayed. Perhaps it was stubbornness, a refusal to be scared off by my own imagination. Perhaps it was financial necessity, the knowledge that I couldn’t afford to break my lease. Or perhaps, deep down, I was waiting—waiting to understand what had driven the last tenant away. Waiting to see if whatever had driven them out would come for me too.

The house was old, but not crumbling. It had character. High ceilings, intricate crown molding, solid wooden doors. The kind of place that whispers of history, of lives once lived within its walls. I ran my fingers along the wooden railings, feeling the smooth polish that had dulled over time. The air inside was stale, like a house that had been sealed too long, but I figured a few open windows would fix that. But even with the windows wide open, there was a certain stillness to the air, as if it was holding its breath, waiting for something to stir it into motion.

There was something about it—something still, almost like the house was waiting for something. Or someone. The walls seemed to lean in ever so slightly, their presence pressing against me in ways I couldn't quite explain. I remember standing in the living room that first night, staring into the dimly lit hallway, the air heavy with silence. It felt like I had interrupted something, like I had walked into a room where a conversation had just ended, the silence thick with expectation. The chandelier overhead barely swayed, yet I could have sworn I heard the faintest tinkling of glass, as if something unseen had brushed against it.

I listened, my breath held, straining to pick up the source of the disturbance. The sound was faint, barely audible—a whisper of movement, like fabric shifting against fabric. I turned, expecting to see something, anything, but the room remained empty. Still, the sensation of being watched lingered. My skin prickled, a cold sensation spreading across my back. The air felt thick, almost weighted, as though something unseen was pressing down on the very atmosphere of the house.

As the night wore on, the sensation deepened. It was not merely the feeling of an old house settling, nor was it the paranoia of being in a new space. No, this was something else. Something intentional. The walls seemed to absorb sound, muffling even my own footsteps. I could hear my own heartbeat, steady but a touch too fast. Every time I moved, I felt as though I was not alone, as though the very walls were listening.

It was in that moment, standing there in the eerie quiet of my new home, that I realized something peculiar. The house did not simply feel abandoned. It felt expectant.

I listened for a while, standing completely still, trying to pick up on whatever presence I felt was looming just beyond the edges of my perception. I strained my ears, expecting—what? A whisper? A sigh? The faintest shuffle of unseen footsteps? But there was nothing. Only the oppressive quiet. The shadows in the corners seemed just a little too dark, just a little too thick, but I shook the thought away.

I chalked it up to new-house jitters and exhaustion. The house was unfamiliar; it would take time to settle into it, I told myself. But I couldn’t shake the lingering feeling that I was being watched. And not just watched—studied, examined, as though something unseen was trying to understand me, trying to decide if I truly belonged.

At first, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Days passed in quiet solitude, the house slowly growing familiar, its corners and crevices becoming part of my routine. I spent my time unpacking, trying to make the space feel like my own. I filled the shelves with my books, hung paintings on the walls, and rearranged furniture to my liking. Yet, no matter how many personal touches I added, the house never quite felt like mine. It was as if it refused to accept me as its new owner. It felt empty, but not in the way an unoccupied home feels—it was an unnatural emptiness, one that suggested something had been removed, leaving behind an unsettling absence.

As the days stretched into weeks, I found myself growing more uneasy, though I couldn’t pinpoint why. The silence of the house was too deep, too complete. There were moments I would be reading, working, or simply existing in a room, and I would become acutely aware that something was missing. It wasn’t just an absence of sound, but an absence of presence—like the space around me wasn’t as lifeless as it should have been, like it was waiting for something.

At first, the little things were easy to ignore. The occasional creak from the floorboards, the flickering of the hallway light, the way the walls seemed to groan late at night. Old houses settle, or so people say. But the more time I spent there, the harder it became to dismiss the peculiarities. The draft in the hallway was persistent, never fading no matter how high I turned up the heat. The scent of dust and something faintly metallic lingered in the air. At times, the rooms seemed darker than they should have been, as though the shadows clung just a little too long to the edges of the walls, stretching in ways that didn’t quite make sense.

I would catch movement in the corners of my vision, but when I turned my head, there was nothing there. It wasn’t just once or twice—it was frequent, unsettling. I started feeling reluctant to turn my back on open doorways. There were areas I began to avoid—particularly the hallway at night, where the air always felt heavier, thick with an unseen pressure, as if unseen eyes were watching from just beyond the reach of the dim light. Walking through it felt like moving through an unseen presence, something brushing against my skin without touching me.

Then came the noises—soft at first, but unmistakable. The faint sound of footsteps when I was the only one home. The hush of fabric against fabric, as if someone had shifted just out of sight. A quiet, almost imperceptible sigh, coming from an empty room.

It was then that I realized: I was not alone.

Then there were the objects. Small things, moving when I wasn’t looking. My phone, always on my nightstand, would be on the kitchen table in the morning. My keys moved from my bag to the front door. Once, I left a book open on my coffee table before going to bed, only to find it closed the next morning, placed neatly back on the shelf. Other times, the changes were subtler—my jacket would be draped over a chair instead of hung on the hook, a glass of water half-empty on the counter when I was sure I had never poured one. It wasn’t just a single incident. It kept happening, over and over, like something was shifting my world around me when I wasn’t looking.

At first, I tried to explain it away—I was distracted, I was tired, I had simply forgotten where I had placed them. But deep down, I knew. The uneasy feeling that something was watching me grew stronger each day, like unseen eyes following my every movement. The atmosphere in the house seemed different, heavier, the kind of weight that presses against your chest without explanation.

And then, there was the door.

The one I had never noticed before. The one that didn’t seem to belong.

It was in the hallway, positioned so naturally that it was easy to overlook. But once I saw it, I couldn’t unsee it. It wasn’t just that it looked out of place—it felt out of place, like something that had been forced into the world without belonging to it. The wood was a shade darker than the other doors in the house, its grain coarser, its handle colder to the touch than it should have been. It was locked, or so I thought.

At first, I ignored it, thinking my mind was playing tricks on me. Maybe I just hadn't paid close enough attention before. But something about it felt off—like it hadn't always been there, like it had slipped into existence when I wasn't looking. I traced my fingers along its edges, feeling the faintest resistance, as if it were pressing back against me. It gave me the distinct, uncomfortable impression that it was waiting for something—or someone—to open it.

I started checking the door every day. Sometimes, I swore it was slightly different. The handle felt looser, the wood seemed more worn, as if someone had touched it in my absence. Once, I noticed small smudges near the base, like something had brushed against it from the other side. My heartbeat quickened. Had it always been like that?

The longer I stared, the more convinced I became that the door wasn’t just locked—it was keeping something in. And whatever it was, it wanted out.

For days, I tried to convince myself I was imagining things. I passed by the door as quickly as I could, refusing to acknowledge its presence. But the more I ignored it, the more it seemed to demand my attention. The draft in the hallway grew colder, carrying with it a faint, musty scent that reminded me of damp earth and something metallic. At first, I thought it was just the changing season, the natural chill of an old house, but it was persistent. No amount of heating or insulation seemed to make a difference.

I started waking up in the middle of the night with a strange, gnawing anxiety, as if I had forgotten something crucial—something that lingered just outside my memory’s reach. My dreams became restless, filled with indistinct figures standing in doorways, whispering words I couldn't quite hear. Some nights, I awoke to the feeling of something unseen shifting in the room, a sensation of pressure, as though the air itself had thickened around me. I would sit up, breathless, scanning the darkness for movement, but nothing ever appeared.

And then there was the knocking—soft at first, rhythmic, as though someone were testing the barrier between us. It always came late at night, when the house was at its quietest, making it impossible to dismiss as mere house-settling noises. Some nights, the knocks would come in sets of three. Other times, they would stretch out in odd, uneven intervals, as if whoever—or whatever—was on the other side was growing impatient. The first time it happened, I convinced myself it was a trick of the wind, but when it continued—relentless, deliberate—I could no longer deny that something was trying to get my attention.

One evening, when I could no longer stand the unease gnawing at me, I pressed my ear against the wood. My heartbeat pounded in my ears, my breath shallow as I strained to hear something—anything—that might confirm my paranoia was unfounded. For a moment, there was nothing but silence. Then, just as I was about to pull away, I heard it: a breath, shallow and deliberate, just on the other side of the door. A slow, rattling inhale, followed by an even longer exhale. It was not the sound of wind, nor was it the sound of an old house settling. It was unmistakably human.

I stumbled backward, my pulse hammering in my ears. My rational mind fought to make sense of it, to dismiss it as fatigue, an auditory illusion born from paranoia. But another part of me—one that had been growing louder in recent weeks—knew better. There was something behind that door. And it knew I had been listening.

The next night, the knocking changed. It was no longer just a test—it was a demand. The knocks came louder, more insistent, shaking the door in its frame. I buried myself under the covers, clenching my fists, refusing to respond, refusing to give in to the panic clawing at my chest. Minutes passed, then hours. When I finally worked up the courage to glance at the door, I saw something that made my blood run cold.

The handle had turned. Just slightly. As if something had tried to open it, but had stopped, waiting. Waiting for me to make the first move.

The nights after that were worse. The shuffling turned into slow, deliberate pacing, like someone—something—was moving just outside my room, waiting. The murmuring became more distinct, the syllables forming patterns, hushed whispers that stopped whenever I strained to listen. Sometimes, it sounded like my name. Sometimes, it sounded like laughter—dry and distant, as though whatever was inside the door was amused by my fear.

I started locking my bedroom door at night, but that didn’t help. The pacing in the hallway grew louder, the murmurs turning into soft, scratchy words I couldn’t quite make out. The pressure in the air became suffocating, a weight pressing against my chest as I lay in bed, unable to move. The feeling of being watched became unbearable, the certainty that something was standing just beyond my door, waiting for me to acknowledge it.

One night, I awoke to the sensation of breath against my ear, my body frozen in place, my mind screaming at me to move, but I couldn’t. The breath was slow, deliberate, as though savoring the moment. My skin prickled, my pulse erratic as an unnatural silence fell over the room. And then, as if sensing my terror, the whisper came again, a slow, cruel repetition of words I couldn’t fully understand.

It wasn’t just outside my room anymore. It was closer.

The following nights were worse. I would wake up to the feeling of weight on my bed, the unmistakable sensation of pressure at my feet, as though something unseen was standing there, watching. My blankets would be tugged, just slightly, just enough to let me know I wasn’t alone. The whispering turned into guttural murmurs, foreign and distorted, shifting between tones and cadences, imitating voices that weren’t mine.

I stopped sleeping. I stopped turning off the lights. But none of it helped.

Then, one night, the door handle turned. The sound was unmistakable—a slow, deliberate click, followed by a pause, as though whatever was on the other side was waiting for me to react. I held my breath, my fingers digging into the mattress as I listened, praying it would stop.

It didn’t.

The handle twisted again, this time more forcefully. A sharp, insistent creak filled the room as the door cracked open a fraction of an inch, revealing nothing but a yawning black void beyond. A void that seemed to breathe, to shift in unnatural silence.

And then, a voice—low, rasping, unmistakably mine—whispered: ""Let me in.""

The door didn’t slam shut this time. It stayed open, just a sliver, enough for me to see the darkness beyond. Enough for whatever was lurking there to see me too.

I couldn’t move. My breath hitched, caught somewhere in my throat. The stillness of the room pressed in on me like a weight, suffocating and inescapable. The whisper had been barely audible, yet it rang through my mind, echoing in the recesses of my thoughts. The shadows at the door seemed thicker, more tangible, as if something were standing just beyond, watching. Waiting.

A slow, deliberate creak filled the silence as the door moved—just slightly, just enough to widen the sliver of darkness. My body tensed as a shape shifted in the void, no more than a silhouette. The air grew frigid, biting against my skin, and I swore I could hear breathing—slow, measured, just beyond the threshold.

Then, the whisper changed. It elongated, the syllables stretching unnaturally, the voice no longer quite mine. It was distorted, inhuman, layered—multiple voices speaking at once, all whispering the same demand: ""Let me in.""

The shadows rippled, shifting in unnatural ways. The door creaked wider, inch by inch, the darkness expanding beyond its frame as if the void itself were bleeding into the room. I tried to force myself to move, to shut my eyes, but I couldn’t. My limbs refused to obey, my body frozen under an invisible force that pressed against my chest, suffocating.

The breathing grew louder. It wasn’t just beyond the door anymore. It was in the room.

A sudden burst of wind sent the curtains billowing, though the windows were closed. My breath caught as I realized the shadows on the floor weren’t cast by the dim glow of the hallway light. They were moving, stretching toward me. The air was filled with a low, rattling sound—like a sigh, or laughter. My heartbeat thundered in my ears, drowning out everything else.

Then, without warning, the door slammed shut.

The silence that followed was worse than the noise. My ears rang in the absence of sound. I sat there, paralyzed, staring at the door, waiting for it to move again. But it didn’t. The pressure in the room lifted, the air growing lighter. The overwhelming presence faded, retreating just beyond the threshold.

But I knew it wasn’t gone. It was waiting. And next time, it wouldn’t stop at just whispering..

I clenched my fists beneath the sheets, my knuckles white. My instincts screamed at me to run, to flee from whatever lurked in the hallway. But my body refused to respond. I was paralyzed, trapped in the grasp of something unseen but undeniably present.

Then, the whisper came again—softer this time, almost playful: ""Let me in.""

The voice scraped along the edges of my consciousness, sending icy tendrils of fear crawling up my spine. It wasn’t just mimicking my voice anymore. It had changed. Twisted. Warped into something else, something that no longer belonged to me.

The silence that followed was heavier than before, thick with an unseen presence. And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the door creaked again—this time, closing. Not slamming, not forced, but deliberate, as if the thing beyond it was retreating, but not leaving.

By the time morning came, I convinced myself it had been a dream. A nightmare conjured by my exhaustion and paranoia. But when I opened my bedroom door, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth, heavier than before, as though the walls had been steeped in it overnight. The hallway was still and quiet, but I knew—deep down—I wasn’t alone.

A shiver coursed down my spine as I noticed something else—the floorboards just outside my room weren’t just scratched anymore. They were gouged. Deep, uneven grooves ran parallel to the door, as though something with long, clawed fingers had dragged itself closer, inch by inch, in the dark.

And at the threshold, just beneath my doorframe, was a single word scratched into the wood.

**MINE.**

A trail of faint smudges, like smeared dirt, led from the hallway back toward that door—the one I had tried so hard to ignore. The scratches didn’t just stop at my doorway. They veered toward the baseboards, as if something had pressed itself against the wall, listening, waiting. My heart pounded as I knelt, reaching out to touch one of the deeper grooves. The wood splintered beneath my fingertips, brittle, as if it had been rotting from the inside.

I knew then that ignoring it was no longer an option. Because whatever was behind that door wasn’t just waiting anymore.

It was getting closer.

And it wasn’t alone.

The air in my room had taken on a different quality—thicker, more oppressive, as if the very walls were pressing in on me. The space felt smaller at night, as though unseen forces were closing in, suffocating me beneath their silent weight. The very air seemed to pulse with a presence just beyond my comprehension. It was as though the house itself was holding its breath, waiting for something I could not see.

I found myself waking at odd hours, drenched in sweat, my sheets tangled around my limbs. My breathing came fast and shallow, my skin damp with unease. The shadows in the corners of my room seemed deeper, shifting ever so slightly when I looked at them too long. And the whispers—oh, the whispers. They had grown more persistent, no longer fading in and out but lingering, clinging to the silence like cobwebs. At first, they were just faint murmurs, like the wind sighing through old walls. But as the nights stretched on, they changed. They became clearer, forming syllables that skated along the edges of my consciousness, words just out of reach.

Some nights, I swore I could feel something standing at the foot of my bed, its presence cold and unmoving, a silent observer to my growing paranoia. I tried to tell myself it was nothing, that my imagination was running wild in the empty darkness. But the sensation of being watched never left me. I would close my eyes and still feel it there, waiting, patient, as though it knew I could sense it. It took everything in me not to pull the covers over my head and pretend that if I couldn't see it, it couldn't see me.

Then, one night, the whispers stopped. The silence should have been a relief, but it wasn’t. It was worse. It was absolute—an unnatural stillness that made my ears ring with the absence of sound. The air felt heavier than before, pressing down on me with suffocating weight. And in that silence, I knew.

It wasn’t just standing at the foot of my bed anymore.

It was closer.

Then, one night, I woke up to the sound of a distinct click.

The door—that door—was ajar.

A cold wave of terror crashed over me as I realized the handle was still slightly turned, as if a hand had just released it. The space beyond it was blacker than the hallway should have been, the shadows inside thicker, unnatural. There was something standing there, just barely visible in the sliver of darkness. Watching. Waiting. It was a shape, a silhouette, almost humanoid but wrong in its proportions—its head tilted too far, its limbs slightly too long. A deep, suffocating dread settled over me, pinning me to the mattress. I tried to move, to scream, but the air felt thick, my breath shallow and strained.

Then, it shifted. Just a fraction of an inch. Enough for me to see the gleam of something—teeth? No, not quite. A grin, stretching too wide, its edges curling unnaturally upward. My vision blurred as my heart pounded against my ribs, my pulse a deafening drumbeat in my ears.

The whisper came again, slithering through the darkness, its tone no longer a perfect mimic of mine. It had changed, distorted, hollow yet dripping with something—glee? Malice?

""Let me in.""

The words echoed through my skull, filling every space within me, pressing against my thoughts like an invasive force. My body remained frozen, my breath trapped in my throat. I wanted to scream, to reach for my phone, to do anything but lie there paralyzed under the weight of its gaze. But I could do nothing except watch as the door creaked open a fraction wider, and the thing behind it pressed closer.

Then, as suddenly as it had come, it pulled back. The door slammed shut, rattling in its frame, and I gasped as the weight on my chest lifted. The silence that followed was deafening.

I knew then: it wasn’t going to stop. It wasn’t waiting anymore.

It was inside.

And then, in a voice that was almost mine, it whispered: ""Let me in.""

The sound was low, rasping, but unmistakably familiar. It was my own voice, warped, like a recording played back at the wrong speed. My stomach clenched as a cold sweat prickled down my spine. My hands gripped the blanket, but I dared not move. My mind screamed at me to close my eyes, to pretend I hadn't heard it.

The figure shifted slightly, as though leaning closer. A shadowed hand reached toward the doorframe, fingers long and tapering to a fine point. The air crackled with a presence I couldn't comprehend, something ancient and patient. It knew I was awake. It knew I could see it.

I shot up, heart hammering in my chest. The figure didn't move, but the whisper came again, this time closer, pressing against the walls of my mind: ""Let me in.""

A sudden rush of cold air swept through the room, making the curtains billow violently as if something had rushed past. My breath hitched, and I pressed myself against the headboard, my pulse thundering. The door, still ajar, quivered slightly, as though something on the other side was testing its weight, pressing against it ever so slightly. The shadows beyond it shifted, a darkness that moved independently of the dim light in the hallway.

Then, slowly, the whispering grew louder, repeating the same three words over and over—""Let me in""—each repetition growing more distorted, more unnatural, until the voice wasn’t just mimicking mine anymore. It was something else entirely.

The whisper turned into a slow, grating chuckle. Then, footsteps—soft at first, dragging against the floorboards. I knew the layout of my house, and yet the footsteps didn’t follow a logical path. They circled, stopped, started again, moving closer and then farther away as if deliberately trying to confuse me.

The pressure in the room was unbearable. The air thickened, like trying to breathe underwater. I gasped, gripping the blankets as my vision blurred. My ears rang. And then, as suddenly as it had started, the sound stopped. Everything was silent, save for the pounding of my own heartbeat.

I hadn’t touched the door. I was sure I hadn’t. But there it was, open just enough to reveal an ink-black void beyond. My skin crawled as I watched it, waiting, breath held, unable to move. The darkness inside seemed to pulse, almost beckoning. The laughter, distant now, echoed through my head.

Then, slowly, the door creaked back into place, shutting itself with an unnatural finality, as if it had never been open at all.

After that, I couldn't pretend anymore.

Because I just heard it whisper my name.

And this time, it wasn’t just whispering. It was laughing. And it wasn’t alone.",4,1739288012.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I’ve heard that Italians normally perceive someone ordering a cup of tea over coffee as them probably being sick/down with a stomachache etc, which would be amusing if I were to ever live there because drinking tea has become a part of my daily routine. 

Also, I saw someone state that tea drinking is more common in the North (during breakfast). Does that mean that drinking tea is associated with the upper class (?) because in the UK, we drink tea regardless of socio-economic background.

Not my first post about this but I live with my husband and MIL currently because she is recovering from cancer surgery. 

I work from home and I am not qualified or able to look after her independently so she invites other people to come over help, unfortunately these people are deciding it’s appropriate to comment on me and my standards of living.

I am not a neat freak however I am by no means a slob. I don’t deep clean every day because I don’t deem it necessary plus I’m also physically disabled myself. I spend a lot of my day in one room so I tend to spot clean in the meantime. 

I also had some leftover curry I made in the fridge from the night before because I intended to eat the leftovers today.

That being said, all I could hear earlier was how my curry stank from the guest and how I was awful for not helping with the hoovering while his mum was ill. This made me extremely annoyed because it felt like it was rude to make those comments in someone else’s home (the house is mine and hubbys). I actually made another post about it because I was that ticked off. The house was not dirty and if you don’t like the smell of my leftovers don’t go in my fridge. This woman is a known neat freak in the family.

Here’s where things have changed and I might be the a hole.

While annoyed, I messaged my husband and he called me back, agreeing that the guests behaviour was rude and needed to be addressed at the nearest opportunity. At that point I felt heard and a lot better.

I pretty much hid in our room out of sight until this woman left because I didn’t trust myself not to loose my shit after overhearing their comments.

I’ve now gone downstairs to make some coffee and his mum has just commented that I was talking about her on the phone to my husband (her son) . I was really annoyed and passive aggressively told her that she shouldn’t have slagged me off with her sister then. Their comments on what I keep in my fridge was entirely unnecessary and rude and apologised for the disgustingness of our home. I told her I do what I can to help but I have my own struggles with health and my own job. I also said that it was a private conversation and she shouldn’t have confronted me about it. I shouldn’t have to listen to them bitching about me when I’m doing what I can. I was also trying to work while hearing this so I find it frustrating that I was being called lazy.

Now MIL is pissed at me but I don’t regret a word. Cancer or not she was rude. This might be controversial but I don’t forget all sins or put on rose tinted glasses if someone is ill. If they’re in control of their actions they can still take responsibility for them.

Was I wrong for doing this?

Note: She is not dying and I have tried my best to care and be nice to her up until this even though we have never had a great relationship. I have always tried to be kind for my husbands sake

1in11xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1in11xz/deeper_goes_the_rabbit_hole/,Deeper Goes the Rabbit Hole,"I was fourteen the first time I remember someone dying. Two blocks from my house I was riding down the street and saw a man, motionless in his front yard, covered in blood. The man had just killed his family. Wife, two kids, their dog. Stabbed them each dozens of times, dragging them out the front door to be put on display for the neighborhood. It was a horror scene, but there was a crowd formed before the police showed up, and he didn’t move. He just kept repeating, “The book made me do it.” Soon after he was catatonic. I don’t think he ever recovered. The thing that stuck with me the most were his eyes. Wide, blank, like his mind had left before his body. I saw those same eyes in my bathroom mirror this morning but, I guess I should start at the beginning.



I love used bookstores. The older, the better. The kind where the shelves are overflowing, and you can smell the history in the air. Dust, old paper, and a hint of something that could be mildew but feels more like memory. I found the book in a used bookstore I’d never seen before on the outskirts of my town. It was wedged between a laundromat that had seen better days and a place that sold knockoff vape cartridges. The kind of store that shouldn’t still be in business, cash only, no receipts and very few customers.



Books were stacked floor to ceiling, the air thick with dust. Three dollars per book, no exceptions. I spent an hour scanning the shelves, running my fingers over the cracked spines, letting instinct guide me like so many trips to bookstores in the past. That’s when I saw it. A faded red hardcover with no dust jacket. There was also no author name on the spine, just the title in gold letters, half-peeled:



Deeper Goes the Rabbit Hole.



I picked it up and flipped it open expecting some bizarre take on Alice in Wonderland. No summary. No publishing date, odd. Just a single line scrawled on the inside cover ""To those who seek the depths, may you find yourself within."" I don’t know why, but I felt like the book had been waiting for me so I grabbed the three bucks from my pocket and gave it to the wholly uninterested person at the front counter.



I couldn’t put the book down. The protagonist, no that’s not right, the villain was a man with three names and reminded me of the way serial killers and assassins are always named. He called himself The Scholar, and was obsessed with lost knowledge. He wanted to understand the world’s forgotten corners, the gaps in history that no one questioned. But as he dug deeper, he learned how to slip through them. I was really enjoying the read, and noticed, scribbled in the margins of one of the pages was a weird handwritten note, “if you start, you won’t stop.”



Reality wasn’t solid for The Scholar. He could unmoor himself from time, step through the cracks in existence. But the price was steep, he needed fuel, needed energy. Memories. Experiences. Lives.



He started small. A whispered secret stolen from a stranger’s lips. The taste of a childhood birthday cake, ripped from a man’s mind. A woman’s wedding day erased from existence, her husband left staring blankly, unable to remember why he felt so empty. The more he took, the less human he became. The more power he felt.



I couldn’t stop reading.



The first time I lost time, I told myself it was just exhaustion. I have been putting extra hours in at the office lately. So maybe just stress, or too much coffee, but something felt… off. I remember standing in my kitchen, making coffee. Why are there two cups? I watched the clock click to 8:00 PM. I blinked, only a blink, just once, and suddenly I was sitting on my couch, the book in my lap, my fingers curled around the pages. I looked at my watch, 11:45 PM.



I don’t remember sitting down. I don’t remember picking up the book again. My coffee was still in the kitchen, untouched, long gone cold. My legs ached like I hadn’t moved for hours but my mind felt… stretched, like I’d been somewhere else entirely. And I was forgetting something, something so important. Adrenaline was coursing through my veins and I was sweating, but the air was cool in my living room. I should have been scared then. I should have put the book down or thrown it away.



I was compelled to open it again.



I lost time again, but this time I couldn’t just chalk it up to exhaustion. I came to focus with the book on my chest, my fingers curled around the pages. My eyes felt strained, like they had been glued open and not allowed to close. Didn’t remember anything past midnight. Was I alone? It’s not unusual for me to read late into the night on weekends. It’s my stress release and really my only hobby these days. That and taking care of, taking care of something. I couldn’t remember, I was too tired.



I went to the bathroom to splash water on my face and looked up. My reflection didn’t quite look like what I remembered. The angles of my face were too sharp and my skin stretched too light. My nails were longer too, at least a week's worth of growth. My lips were parted like I was whispering something, but I wasn't making a sound. And my eyes, there was nothing in my eyes. Just blank, black pits. No recognition, no me. Then my reflection blinked. I didn’t, my own reflection blinked first.



I stumbled back, knocking over my toothbrush holder, all three toothbrushes fell to the floor. My heart pounded against my ribs, every instinct screaming to look away, but I couldn’t. I stood there, gasping, waiting for whatever was in the mirror to move again. It didn’t. It just stared back at me. Waiting. Like it was eager for me to catch up. I backed out of the bathroom and turned off the light. I couldn’t bear to see it anymore. With the room shrouded in darkness, I felt like I could move again. Panic set in and I paced around my living room. Stepping over the obstacles as I made my circular path, but I felt pulled to the couch where I had left the book.



My phone rang and startled me to focus. My fingers were curled around the book, pressing  into the pages like I’d been holding on for dear life. Wasn’t I just walking? I grabbed my phone. It was a coworker. I almost let it go to voicemail, but a pit formed in my stomach. I answered.



“Eh, hey, you ok?” Her voice was tense, concerned.



“Yeah, why? Just tired”



“You called me like five minutes ago. You were whispering. I couldn’t make out what you were saying, but it sounded weird. Like you were growling”



My throat went dry. I don’t remember calling her. Checked my recent calls and there it was, a two-minute call at 2:37 AM.



“I, eh, must have been sleep-talking” I managed.



“Then why were you laughing?” She asked, far more frustrated than concerned now. I hung up because any explanation would have made me sound crazy.



Then I read the next chapter.



The Scholar was in a crowded marketplace. He brushed against a mother carrying her child, and the little boy ceased to exist. Not just dead, erased. The woman blinked, confused, staring at the empty space in her arms. As I read, I could hear it. The mother’s scream. The absence of the child, crying out in some void just beyond the words on the page. And beneath it all, a breath against my neck. Did I have a child?



I took another break, 5 AM, to stretch my legs. I really should have gone to bed. Just put the book down and gone to bed but a vague memory in the back of my head came to the forefront. I felt like it was violently pushed to the forefront. That man in his front yard. At some point I must have grabbed a knife because it was still in my hand, but I didn’t have anything to cut. That was strange.



Maybe one more chapter.



Something shifted. The air in my apartment thinned. The walls seemed farther away. The book in my lap grew heavier, like it was sinking into my skin. And my eyes... I could barely see past the pages. My vision narrowed into a tunnel and I couldn’t close my eyes. They ached from dryness but I couldn’t blink. I know the sun must be up by now, but I can’t see anything but this book. I heard my phone ringing, but when I picked it up, the voice on the other end sounded garbled, none of it made any sense, so I hung up.



One more chapter.



I think I know how this ends.  I’ve already lost so much, I just wish I could remember what it was. I’m afraid to figure it out. My hands won’t move.



I can feel the strain in my muscles, the tension in my fingers. I tell them to let go, to drop the book, but they won’t respond. They haven’t been mine for some time now. I can’t help but hyperventilate. Oh, god, what have I done? My vision tunnels. The book is vibrating beneath my finger tips, humming with some horrible anticipation.



The final chapter is waiting.



I hear my phone ringing again. Someone is shouting my name through the front door. Pounding against the wood, trying to get to me. I try to answer but my body won’t obey. It’s not mine anymore. The sounds are all fading.



I watch my own fingers turn the page.



Oh, god, no. The book made me do it. And I know soon, it will find someone else.",2,1739287431.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I did not realize at the time the indigo was a completely different powder, I thought it was a color. Anyway, most of my hair is fine but Al the grey turned purple. I tried doing the dark brown again last night but it’s still purple. I searched the group and found a lot of ideas but now I’m a little overwhelmed with options and still have questions. 

Should I wait a few weeks before trying again or just go right over the top of what I already have on there? I haven’t washed it yet after the last round because I just did it last night. 

Should I use just straight henna? Will i still need to do indigo again or will the indigo base with henna on top be sufficient?

[Part One](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iho0ao/im_trapped_in_a_hardware_store_i_just_found_a/)

 My world narrows until the only thing left  is the price tag, the warmth from the flickering screen, the shifting text, and my name. Korynn Wallace. And beneath it, in bold black letters: LOW STOCK.

I can’t move. I can’t think. There’s something fundamentally wrong about seeing my own name printed there—like I’m not a person, just an item waiting to be pulled from the shelf.

The intercom crackles, a slow hiss that coils in my ears.

“Aisle associate Korynn please make your way to the Employee Lounge.”

My stomach plummets as the floor shifts dramatically, and throws me off balance. I try to resist it, but the Store doesn’t care what I want. My boots lose traction. My body lurches forward, weight pulling me down like I’ve stepped onto the edge of a slide I didn’t know was there.

I throw my hands out, reaching for anything—the floor, the base of a shelf, a loose product—but it’s useless. The ground is too smooth, the tiles too slick beneath my fingertips. I slam against a metal shelf, fingers clawing at the edge, but it tilts with me, the products shifting, sliding, tumbling past me in a slow-motion avalanche. A box clips my shoulder.

I try to grab anything. My nails scrape against the tile. The friction rips at them. Something sharp splits the edge of my thumb. A flare of pain. I feel the sticky warmth of blood. Still, I scramble, dig, claw, but the Store isn’t letting me stop. It wants me to go forward. Toward him. I slam into the Manager. I choke on a breath as I stumble back to my feet, the shock of it knocking the panic loose. The Manager doesn’t flinch.He doesn’t even acknowledge that I just crashed into him. 

The Store stops tilting. The floor settles. The movement ceases. I stand there, panting, heart hammering. Blood wells from the split edge of my nail. My fingers sting. I stumble back from the Manager, gasping, my balance still unsteady, my fingers burning from the futile attempt to claw onto something—anything.

But as my breath rattles in my throat, as the blood from my broken nail drips onto the tile, I realize— The Store has changed again. The shelves are gone. The aisles have disappeared. I am somewhere else. A hallway. And I know this hallway. Even before my brain fully registers where I am, I feel my muscles clench.

The words rip out of my mouth before my brain can even catch up. 

**""No! No, no, no—Not here. Not here. Please, anywhere but here!""**

I’ve seen this place before, but only in glimpses—from a distance, in the gaps between shifting aisles. Once, when I was running from a fight near the Iron Fang’s territory, I turned a corner and saw it.

A long, windowless corridor, lined with more  fluorescent lights. It’s too clean, too perfect. It didn’t look like it belonged in the store at all. I ran the other way. Everyone did. The factions don’t talk about it much, but when they do, they call it the Employee Lounge. No one who goes in has ever come back.

And now, I’m the one stepping inside. 

The hallway ends abruptly. One moment, I’m being led through the impossible corridor. The next, the Manager in front of me steps aside, and I am somewhere else.

The Employee Lounge. I don’t step in. I don’t want to. But the Manager doesn’t force me, it doesn’t need to. Because as I blink and take in my surroundings - I see the door that was just in front of me has already closed behind me.

I take a breath and I regret it immediately. The air is thick and stale. Not like the rest of the Store. The Lounge is sealed. Preserved. Like no air has moved in years. I get the strange feeling that  no one ever really breathes here.

There is furniture. Chairs. A seemingly cheap plastic couch. A table with old magazines whose pages are blank. A vending machine glows softly in the corner. Perfectly stocked. But something about it makes my skin crawl. Everything feels off, even the the coffee brewing in the corner.  I don’t know why, until I realize—The vending machine should be whirring, the coffee should be making a sound with each drip into the pot. I wait, but sound never comes. Then i realized something else - the coffee never finishes brewing. The pot is half full. But it never fills more than that. It just keeps going. 

I turn my gaze away from the pot, trying not to think about it. Then, I see them. I see people. They’re sitting at the tables, still, silent, staring at the TV. They aren’t moving or blinking. They aren’t bound or restrained. But they don’t try to leave. They just… sit. Their faces are expressionless. Their eyes fixed forward as if they’ve forgotten how to move.

Something churns in my gut. My chest tightens. I don’t know what I expected—something violent, something immediate. But I think this is worse. The Manager moves toward the center of the room. It doesn’t look at the others because they are exactly where they should be. Instead, it turns toward me. And sits. He just sits down, like this is just a breakroom, like we are just in the middle of an interview, like this is simply another day.

And then it gestures to me in a  slow, deliberate movement. His hand, palm up toward the seat across from him. He’s telling me to sit. I don’t move. I won’t.

The Manager tilts its head—a fraction too far. A burst of static, shrieks overhead,  my pulse slams against my neck, my heart beating wildly in its cage. Then I hear a voice.

“Thank you for joining us”

My body locks up. The Manager’s mouth doesn’t move. But it keeps gesturing. Like it’s the one speaking. But it isn’t, the intercom is. The words are perfectly clear, perfectly calm. Like something isn’t just saying them—it’s reading them.

The Manager tilts its head again, motions toward the chair across from it. The intercom speaks again.

“We are delighted you've joined us.”

I swallow. My mouth is dry. Then the vending machine hums, shortly after another  sudden noise makes my breath catch in my throat. I hear a soft clunk as something drops into the tray. My fingers twitch at my sides. I know better than to check. I know whatever’s inside isn’t something I want.

The intercom crackles.

“Collect your uniform.”

I glance at the Manager. It hasn’t moved, but its hand has shifted, gesturing toward the vending machine.

Again, the intercom repeats itself, like a mother correcting  a child who has been misbehaving.

“Collect your uniform.”

I force myself forward. My boots echo loud against the carpet. The vending machine buzzes softly. The buttons are blank. I crouch. My fingers hover over the tray. I hesitate. I pull it out slowly, carefully. It’s neatly folded. Pressed. Clean. A blue vest with a logo that reads Pinnacle Hardware.

And pinned to the front—My name tag.

KORYNN WALLACE

Like it’s always been mine. My breath shudders. The intercom crackles again.

“Proceed to the viewing area.”

I look up.

The Manager is waiting. And  beyond it—There are rows of chairs, sat in them are people staring at the screen. The TV flickers. The training video is about to begin.

A moment of static, then a corporate jingle plays—soft, generic, and friendly.

“Welcome to Pinnacle Hardware! Where quality and service never run out.” 

The screen fades in. A man in a neat blue vest stands in front of a fully stocked shelf, holding a clipboard. He has brown hair, parted to the side,one side of his face stretched slightly further then the other and pressed on his face is a smile.

“Hello, and welcome to the team!”

His voice is surprisingly cheerful and warm. I barely register his  words because my gaze is locked on the people watching.

They sit in perfect rows, unmoving, eyes locked on the screen. And in the middle of them—Liam

He went missing three days ago. And now he’s here. Wearing a blue vest. There’s no name on his nametag . His face is blank. But his eyes are open.

I inhale sharply, a sound that seems to scream in the dead silence of the room. The video continues.

“At Pinnacle Hardware, we value hard work, dedication, and customer satisfaction.”

A slogan flashes across the screen:

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION IS TOP PRIORITY.

For a second—no, it was less than a second, it was just a moment—I saw the screen distort. The words change and before I even finish blinking they’re back to normal.

My heartbeat pounds in my ears. The host is still talking, but the words don’t feel like they matter anymore. Because something is wrong with the sound.

Under the cheerful voice, there’s something else. Something faint. A whisper, a second voice, buried beneath the music. I strain to hear it. The TV glitches again. The smiling man’s mouth moves, but the words don’t match.

The whispering grows. A voice. Not from the intercom. Not from the video. A real voice. Speaking my name.

“…Korynn.”

I freeze. The screen flickers violently. The music distorts. The man’s face warps. And the voice—The voice is right behind me.

I’m planning to open a small alfresco coffee shop in my home garden (20 sq meters), where people can enjoy good coffee, light snacks, and borrow books to read or take home. The space will be cozy, filled with plants, and perfect for book lovers, remote workers, and anyone looking for a peaceful place to unwind.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

Coffee & Snacks – Espresso drinks, cold brews, teas, and homemade pastries.

Book-Lending Service – Customers can read on-site for free or sign up for a simple membership to borrow books.

Garden Ambiance – A relaxing, open-air space with wooden tables, string lights, and a book nook.

Community Activities – Book clubs, poetry nights, and coffee workshops in the future.

I’d love to hear your thoughts! Would you visit a place like this? What would make it even better? ",1,1739287282.0,smallbusiness,5,1.0,False

i was quite shut down as a kid bwcause i was so conformistic and ashamed for being different and the athmosphere was quite traditionalistic and held in certain values and energies and i molded myself to fit in quite alot and felt very shut and i literally remember thinking they must not know who i truly am.  i was very sensitive to energies and also became quite codependent with my mom due to her depression i think and internalized some negative energies like low self confidence and parent's negative subconscious projections towards me and some toxic pride too.

 in high school i spent the a lot of time alone focusing on singing and school and whatever and was becoming more of who i truly am and it was difficult because i lived in a small town and overall the people are so different from what i consider resonating to me, just the overall vibe and energy fields formed by beliefs and ideals and what people look for in life. however i slightly gave into ppl pleasing again but I'm now realizing i no longer want to please or can't or otherwise I'm lying to myself and it feels suffocating. i want to let go the mask.

i have three friends atm that i very rarely see (we hung out mostly in 2019-2022). One of them is like, i met her through another friend and we met at parties. To depict our friendship, i occasionally was at her's for coffee and she also visited me a couple of times and we had a shared spotify playlist. i think we were a fit for a while because i was playing a role kind of or trying to create a false life because of a failure i had with singing in high school and because of some expectations i was trying to fill and validation i was trying to get and shame stuff overall. i begun to mimic friends that i didn't even at that point consider my people really but i began to dim myself and adjust my interests like the way i dress and overall opinions and vibe. however i've been realizing over 1,5 years how off track i am ans how stupid my behaviour is because it's just for acceptance or admiration from people I'd never want to be like or don't feel aligned with. So,  I began to change drastically and follow intuition again. it's like I'm aging in reverse and I'm just beginning to realize how bad the enmeshment i have is and i feel like i need to get going fast before it gets worse.

 I haven't been seeing the friends i mimicked but i saw the friend i had been visiting and had the playlist with (for the past few years we have been seeing maybe 4 times and talked a bit online maybe every 2months so we are not in close contact). i told her about some of my thoughts. While i feel like i want to be very drastically different from my family (like i always have been anyways) and seriously my true self, she is very much like she wants to be like her relatives or atleast she shares their vibe and values which are somewhat similar to at least that of my dad's side relatives. i told her I don't know if i want to be friends with her anymore because i feel like i want or need to be who i really am. she was very shocked and like ""i love you so much"" and like, do you not have any feelings for me which i feel was weird because i never considered us that close. like friends but i would never say i loved her.

 now I'm stuck thinking about if there is something wrong with me and i've tried to love her by mimicking my mothers love but it just feels wrong and off and I'm super angry but i keep shutting it down because im scared this is some trauma thing like what if I'm so traumatized i don't care for her or what if my anger is some kind of dysregylation. i even have tried  the friend's attitude and energy but it's just off and I don't even know why i do it for self sabotage on or doubt i guess. anyways i think it's not trauma reaction to not love her, i think it's just my truth and i feel like i want to move on. we did close the friendship via a text but i feel guilty but also following the guilt or like continuing the friendship feels like I'm ingoring my truth and self sabotaging. you know she's not a bad person but just not my kind of person. she reminds me of the time as a kid when it was like ""ok"" but I'm just pleasing and avoiding my truths like having a tape over mouth, having to be very calm and kind or having to be the goofy or rough one but that's not who i want to be and I'm so tired of the ""oh but you can have multiple different sides to you"" stuff like no it frels outdated and i already lived that life and I don't want surround myself with people who mirror those energies and I'm not sure if she understands what i mean with my things. we have different interests and vibes and values.  i know about the ""you need to get along with everyone"" blah blah yeah but i seriously want to move on and get going with my life because especially when it comes to the singing i have serious potential and I'm very young. which is another thing because  she is very ""old"" and mother/auntlike even though we are the same age or at least in my opinion she has a vibe that reminds me of aunt type or some kind of ready to settle and fed up with life whereas i haven't even started. another thing is she really idealizes her mother because she died when she was a kid and really wants to be her byt i have a suffocating enmeshment situation with my mom which i want to destroy. anyways do you think my choice is okay? overall I don't love her but i keep on thinking about some old relatives or therapist kind of people judging me for not being loving enough or that i didn't have to say it that straight or that I'm overracting but I'd rather be honest and myself than just mimic some other person's love to be more fitting and i want a clean slate.

1in0s0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/hawaiiluxurytravel/comments/1in0s0z/hawaiian_islands_the_basics/,Hawaiian Islands - The Basics,"Hawaiʻi consists of six major islands — Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokai, Lānaʻi, Maui and the The Island of Hawaiʻi (also called The Big Island) — plus several smaller islands and atolls. The islands themselves are the result of volcanic activity in the middle of one of Earth’s tectonic plates. In fact, the Big Island is still technically being formed, in a way, by its active volcanoes, Mauna Loa and Kīlauea. A little over 20 miles southeast of the archipelago is the Kamaʻehuakanaloa Seamount, an active underwater volcano that may one day become Hawaiʻi’s newest island.

  
**Airports**: 

* Daniel K. Inouye International Airport, Oʻahu (HNL)
* Kahului Airport, Maui (OGG)
* Kona International Airport, Big Island (KOA)
* Hilo International Airport, Big Island (ITO)
* Lihue Airport, Kauaʻi (LIH) 

**Best time to visit**: 

* There’s no bad time to visit; it really depends on what you’re after. 
* January through March is best for whale watching, while the winter months are best for big-wave surfing. 
* September will see fewer crowds, with June, July, August and December being the busiest months to visit. 

**Key phrases**: 

* aloha (hello/goodbye)
* mahalo (thank you) 
* e kala mai (excuse me)
* e ʻoluʻolu ʻoe (please, *eh oh-loo-oh-loo oh-eh*)
* ʻohana (family)
* moana (ocean)

**The Island of Hawai’i (The Big Island)**

* The Island of Hawaiʻi (also known as The Big Island) is one of the best Hawaiʻian islands for families (especially the Kona side, with its calm waters, coffee farms and wide selection of restaurants and cultural landmarks). 
* There’s a lot to do here, including hiking, snorkeling, exploring active volcanoes in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park *(a must)*, scenic helicopter rides, stargazing on Mauna Kea and so much more. 
* Hawaiʻi is very spiritual as well, and the island’s properties preserve its heritage with strong programming intended to keep its culture alive.

**Oʻahu** 

* Oʻahu is Hawaiʻi’s most commercialized island (it’s home to the state’s capital, Honolulu), but it’s still very much worth visiting. 
* It’s the best island for surfing: the North Shore is legendary for its big-wave surfing, and is home to the famous Banzai Pipeline, which attracts the world's best (and bravest) surfers.
* It’s also amazing for first-time visitors, families and those with limited time. 
* You can visit two spots on Oʻahu and feel like you’ve hit two islands: stay a couple of nights in Waikiki and then jet up to the North Shore; you’ll get a taste of everything the island has to offer.

**Kauaʻi** 

* Kauaʻi is aptly referred to as the Garden Isle; indeed, most of the island is covered by rainforest (Kauaʻi is also Hawaiʻi’s geographically oldest island). 
* Consequently, there is not as much infrastructure here, resulting in a more laid-back, down-to-earth vibe compared to some of the more populated islands. 
* Nature lovers will rejoice at Kauaʻi's rugged cliffs, white-sand beaches, challenging hiking trails, stunning waterfalls and overall natural splendor. 
* Mount Waialeale, in the island’s center, is nearly a mile high, and is one of the wettest places on Earth.

**Maui**

* Maui has always been popular, but now it’s as busy as ever, courtesy of season two of The White Lotus, which was filmed at the Four Seasons Resort Maui at Wailea. Expect lots of fellow visitors, but that doesn’t mean you still can’t have an amazing vacation.
* There are several areas of the island to explore. A top recommendation is Haleakalā, a nearly two-mile-high dormant volcano that beckons hikers, bikers, horseback riders and stargazers. 
* In 2023, fires devastated the town of Lahaina, on Maui’s northwest coast. The town is still re-building, and now it’s as important as ever to support the area’s local businesses.

**Lānaʻi**

* Lānaʻi is quiet, small and blissfully free from crowds. It houses a couple luxury resorts, and is mostly owned by Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle.
* On Lānaʻi, the tiny Lānaʻi City is particularly charming. Browse the local shops, peruse the local art displayed at the [Lānaʻi Art Center](https://lanaiartcenter.org/) and play with rescued cats at the [Lāna‘i Cat Sanctuary](https://lanaicatsanctuary.org/). ",1,1739286726.0,hawaiiluxurytravel,0,1.0,False

Please?,"There's too much negativity going on in this sub lately, mostly by users of the free tier. Don't get me wrong, I get that it sucks when the tier that you're in gets stripped of features that you use, but that doesn't mean that Trakt as a whole is garbage. I'm using Trakt for around 12 years now and it's my most used website/app for a long time even before I came a VIP-member.

Yes, they could've managed the whole transition better, but despite of what some of you may say, $5 a month is not a lot of money in today's world. It's one less coffee or beer a month and the fact that most of you are screaming about it on Reddit proves that you use it enough that a few dollars a month is justified. I really think that everyone who looks at the current situation objectively comes to the same conclusion: Trakt is a business that needs to make money and free users had it too good for too long. This needed to be corrected for Trakt to make it in the long haul. The communication about it was piss poor (I make my money as a communication consultant, so I think I know what I'm talking about), but the correction of the tiers needed to be done.

Let's be honest for a moment: the free tier is for basic users, which means that you track what you watch through the official app. 99,9% of the time, this works easy and simple. You can even have a decent sized watchlist on the side for those movies you don't want to miss and maybe you leave a comment or two on a movie or show that you are really passionate about. And all the time, you can sleep safe and sound knowing that, even though you don't pay a dime for anything, your data is safe and will not be sold. That's what basic users do and get. Nothing more and nothing less. I will recommend the free tier to my friends (who are not such enthusiasts as me, but still love good shows and movies now and then) until the day I die. Why? Because the free tier is still an amazing service.

If you want anything more than that, like large comprehensive lists, automatic tracking, extra statistics, backups, widgets and more stuff like that, that you are an enthusiast. And when you are an enthusiast, it's perfectly normal that you spend a few dollars a month on something that you are passionate about. So passionate in fact, that you scream about it on Reddit and on the Trakt-forum. And that's the simple fact: most of you are not basic users. Sure, it sucks when you have to pay for something where it wasn't needed before, but that doesn't mean your whining is justified. And it definitely doesn't mean that Trakt as a service/website is going to shit.

Sure, change equals resistance, this is always the case, but all this will blow over and Trakt will be fine in the long run. I think even better than before. Because, let's face it, most of the people who are complaining now, didn't support Trakt before. And most who did, will keep on doing it. Maybe Trakt will add a mid-tier in the future (I surely hope so) which gets more, but not all, features to more people. I honestly think that's a good idea, but even if they don't...

Trakt was, is and will be an amazing service for those who use it in a way that fits their tracking habits realistically and it would be great if we showed more support for the entire Trakt-team for the amazing service they deliver, even if things could've been handled better.

TLDR: Trakt is still awesome, their choices are justified, stop complaining about it. Please.",0,1739286482.0,trakt,50,0.2,False

The design is both functional and aesthetic, making it a versatile addition to any space. Its rich espresso finish is warm and inviting, complementing various interior styles from modern to rustic. The engineered wood top has a matte finish, which gives it a clean and classy look, while the metal frame ensures durability. At first, I was skeptical about its sturdiness because lift-top tables often feel wobbly, but this one exceeded my expectations in terms of stability.

The dimensions, 19.7"" D x 41.7"" W x 18.9"" H, make it a perfect fit for medium-sized living rooms. It’s compact enough not to dominate the space but spacious enough to serve multiple purposes. The lift-top mechanism transforms the table into a mini workstation or a dining spot effortlessly. I’ve used it for everything from working on my laptop to enjoying a quick meal while watching TV. It lifts smoothly without any creaking sounds, a feature I appreciate during quiet mornings when I don’t want to wake up the household.

[Check Rolanstar hq-kfzh00E-02 price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/rolanstar-hq-kfzh00e-02-coffee-table-review-b08qjktrx1/)

The hidden storage compartment underneath the tabletop is a game-changer for organizing clutter. I’ve stored remote controls, chargers, and even some board games in there. The two rattan baskets below add extra storage and are perfect for holding blankets or magazines. They’re not only practical but also add a touch of texture to the table’s overall look. I love how everything has its place, keeping my living room tidy without sacrificing style.

One thing I noticed is that while the table is straightforward to clean, it’s not stain-resistant. A minor coffee spill required immediate attention to avoid leaving a mark. I’d recommend using coasters and being cautious with liquids. Maintenance-wise, a dry cloth does the trick for keeping it looking fresh.

Assembling the table was a mixed experience. The instruction manual was clear, and each part was labeled, which made following the steps easy. However, it’s definitely a two-person job, mainly because of the lift-top mechanism and metal frame. My partner and I spent around an hour putting it together, and though it wasn’t difficult, it required some patience. Once assembled, the table felt solid and well-built.

**Pros**

* The lift-top feature is smooth and silent, making it ideal for working or dining.
* Ample storage space with both hidden compartments and rattan baskets for organization.
* Stylish design with a warm espresso finish that blends into different decors.
* Sturdy metal legs and adjustable feet offer stable support.
* Affordable compared to similar multi-functional coffee tables.

**Cons**

* The lift-top mechanism, while smooth, feels slightly flimsy under heavy weight.
* Assembly can be time-consuming and requires two people.
* The exposed screws are visible after assembly, which detracts slightly from the design.
* Lack of stain resistance makes it prone to potential discoloration from spills.
* The surface can scratch if not handled carefully.

In comparison to competitors like the Yaheetech lift-top coffee table or the WLIVE coffee table, the Rolanstar stands out for its unique combination of hidden storage and open baskets. The Yaheetech model is slightly cheaper but lacks the aesthetic appeal and stability of the Rolanstar. On the other hand, WLIVE offers a more modern design but compromises on storage versatility. If you’re looking for a table that balances functionality, style, and affordability, the Rolanstar is a strong contender.

From a cost perspective, I believe the Rolanstar provides excellent value for money. It might not be the cheapest option on the market, but the features and quality justify the investment. Unlike some other budget-friendly tables that feel flimsy or come with limited storage, the Rolanstar offers both durability and multi-functionality.

The lift-top mechanism allows you to use it as a workspace, a feature that’s become essential for me during work-from-home days. It also doubles as a dining table, which has been particularly helpful when I’m hosting friends for casual movie nights. The storage options, from the hidden compartment to the spacious baskets, are unmatched in this price range.

Another feature I found convenient is the adjustable feet, which ensure the table stays level even on slightly uneven flooring. I’ve had coffee tables in the past that wobbled every time someone leaned on them, but that’s not an issue here. The metal legs and frame add a level of durability that’s often missing in similar tables.

While the lack of stain resistance might be a downside, using protective covers or mats can easily mitigate this issue. I also noticed that the lift-top mechanism requires even pressure on both sides to operate smoothly. If you’re someone who tends to use one hand, it might take some getting used to.

1in0lp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuardianTales/comments/1in0lp9/most_efficient_way_to_farm_strengthening_hammers/,Most Efficient Way to Farm Strengthening Hammers?,"Basically what the title says.

With the blacksmith event going on, I'm trying to figure out the best / most efficient way to farm strength hammers to complete as much of my collection book as possible.

So far, I've been farming nothing but the item rifts. But recently, I realized Tetis drops a decent amount of hammers as well. So I was wondering if I should:

* Farm item rift with daily 3x boost, then use remaining coffee on more item rift
* Farm item rift with daily 3x boost, then use remaining coffee to farm Tetis

One thing to note is that I've already completed most of the 3 star item collection, so farming nothing but item rifts feels like diminishing returns, since I really only need the hammers and the items is low level / duplicate junk at this point. I was wondering if the second option will give better returns, since I get hammers (not sure if it's more, less, or same amount) and also the tetis medals, which I could always use more of.

As someone who’s pretty particular about their morning brew, I’m always on the hunt for a coffee maker that balances ease of use, quality, and versatility. This one delivers in ways I didn’t expect, though it has its quirks.

The **design and build quality** caught my eye right away. It’s lightweight, compact, and feels sturdy despite being made mostly of plastic. I’ve been hauling it to the office, on camping trips, and even to my sister’s house for our weekend coffee rituals. It’s shatterproof too, which gives me peace of mind when I toss it into my bag. That said, it doesn’t have the luxurious feel of a high-end stainless steel machine, but its minimalism is part of the charm.

The **brewing performance** is where it truly shines. The patented 3-in-1 brew technology ensures you get a smooth, rich cup without any bitterness or grit. I’ve used it to make everything from strong espresso-like shots to lighter, tea-like brews. The coffee quality is consistent—every cup has that full-bodied flavor that makes you pause and savor each sip. I’ve even converted my coworker, who usually sticks to instant coffee, into an AeroPress devotee.

Customization options are another highlight. You can adjust the strength and amount of coffee easily by tweaking the water level and grind size. The markings on the chamber are intuitive, making it easy for even a newbie to find their preferred settings. It’s not the gadget for someone looking for precise temperature control, though. You’ll need to manually heat your water to around 175°F, which is the sweet spot for this coffee maker.

[Check AeroPress 85A01 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/aeropress-85a01-coffee-maker-review-b000gxz2gs/)

Using the AeroPress is ridiculously simple. I’ve timed myself, and it takes about two minutes to make a cup from start to finish. The plunger mechanism works smoothly, and there’s none of that messy cleanup you’d get with a French press. Speaking of cleanup, it’s a breeze—you just pop out the used coffee puck and give it a quick rinse. It’s not self-cleaning, but it’s so straightforward that I don’t mind.

Its **capacity and size** make it ideal for personal use. The water chamber holds enough for one to three cups, depending on how strong you like your coffee. For bigger households or parties, though, you’d need to brew multiple batches, which could get tedious. On the plus side, it barely takes up any counter space, and you can easily stash it away when it’s not in use.

**Pros**

* Compact and travel-friendly design.
* Produces smooth, grit-free coffee with no bitterness.
* Easy to clean with minimal components.
* Versatile brewing options for different coffee styles.
* Durable and shatterproof material.

**Cons**

* Limited capacity; not ideal for serving multiple people at once.
* Requires manual water heating for optimal results.
* Plastic build might feel less premium to some users.
* No built-in temperature control.

When comparing the AeroPress to competitors like traditional French presses or budget espresso machines, its strengths become even more apparent. Unlike a French press, the AeroPress eliminates grit and bitterness thanks to its paper micro-filters. It also brews faster, taking less than two minutes. Espresso machines, on the other hand, can deliver more authentic shots but are bulky, expensive, and a hassle to clean—none of which are issues here.

However, if you’re someone who needs multiple cups on demand, you might consider alternatives like the Chemex or a pour-over setup. These cater better to larger servings but lack the portability and ease of use that the AeroPress offers.

From a **cost perspective**, the AeroPress is a steal for what you get. While it won’t replace a high-end espresso machine, it’s far more affordable, and the quality of coffee is comparable for most people. Add in the fact that it’s durable and low maintenance, and it’s hard not to see the value.

One feature I didn’t expect to enjoy as much is how travel-ready it is. I’ve taken it to a few camping trips, and it’s been a lifesaver. All you need is hot water, and you’re set for a great cup of coffee anywhere. The included scoop, stirrer, and funnel are handy, though I find the funnel unnecessary for my daily use.

Is it perfect? No, but it’s close. The lack of built-in temperature control is a small inconvenience, and the plastic build might not appeal to everyone. That said, these are minor issues compared to its overall performance.

As someone who takes their morning espresso seriously, I was eager to see if this dual-head coffee leveler could live up to the hype. Spoiler alert: it mostly does—but there are some quirks worth noting.

The very first thing I noticed about this espresso tamper was its solid build and weight. It feels professional in your hands, like it’s ready to handle the job of creating that perfect espresso puck. My Breville Barista Express, which uses a 54mm portafilter, seemed like the perfect match for this tool. The adjustable depth feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to fine-tune your tamping pressure and ensure consistency. Let me tell you, it is a far cry from the flimsy plastic tamper that came with my machine.

In practice, the dual-head design is incredibly convenient. One side is the distributor, which helps level the coffee grounds in the portafilter, and the other is the tamper, which compresses the grounds. The distributor works like magic—just a few twists, and the coffee is evenly spread. No more uneven pucks or channeling! On the other hand, the tamper requires a bit more finesse. Setting the depth just right took me a few tries, but once I got the hang of it, I was pulling better shots consistently.

[Check MATOW B07ZT42HZF price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/product-reviews/best-tamper-matow-b07zt42hzf-review/)

My co-worker, who is also an espresso enthusiast, tried the tamper and had a similar experience. They appreciated the tool’s ability to streamline the process but noted that the learning curve might frustrate beginners. My sister, who is new to making espresso, also loved how the distributor side helped her achieve more consistent results.

**Pros**

* The build quality is excellent—heavyweight and durable, it feels built to last.
* Its dual-head design saves time and space compared to using separate tools.
* Adjustable depth allows for precision, ensuring consistent tamping pressure.
* Fits snugly with Breville 54mm portafilters, making it ideal for popular machines like the Barista Express.
* Easy to clean and maintain, which is a huge bonus for daily use.

**Cons**

* The tamper side could be a better fit; some users might find it slightly off for their portafilter.
* Requires a learning curve to adjust the depth correctly for optimal results.
* A bit on the pricey side, especially for casual coffee drinkers or beginners.
* No instructions included, leaving you to figure it out or search for tutorials online.
* Might not fit non-standard portafilters, limiting its versatility.

**Comparison to Competitors**

When compared to other espresso tampers and distributors like the Normcore or the LuxHaus tamper, the MATOW stands out with its dual-head design. However, some competitors offer calibrated tampers that click when the right pressure is applied, making them more beginner-friendly. While the MATOW excels in build quality and adjustability, its tamper side lacks the seamless ease of use that some single-purpose tampers provide. On the other hand, the dual functionality of the MATOW saves both time and counter space, which is a decisive advantage over having separate tools.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

The MATOW 53mm Coffee Distributor and Tamper isn’t the cheapest accessory you can buy, but it’s a worthwhile investment for serious espresso enthusiasts. Compared to budget tampers, it offers a level of precision and durability that justifies its higher price point. However, if you’re just dabbling in espresso, you might be better off with a simpler, less expensive tool. For those who are committed to mastering the craft, though, this dual-head tool is a game-changer—provided you’re willing to invest a bit of time in learning how to use it effectively.

We went for coffee at a local cafe and the date lasted about 1.5 hours. The date went reasonably well, with some awkward moments (which is expected, given that it was our first time meeting in person). After the date, he texted that he was looking forward to meeting up again and I responded that I felt the same way.

Since our conversation, agreeing to meet up again, he hasn’t texted me back in 2 days. Could he have lost interest, despite saying he wanted to see me again? I don’t want to come across as too clingy, so I don’t want to double text him.

    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I bought a coffee scale to help me adjust everything better. 

However, I am currently reaching my limits a little. I currently have the grinder on the finest setting and grind 18g of ground coffee in the double sieve. According to my idea, I should get 36g-45g of espresso. However, I land at 55-60g of espresso. 

I tamp as hard as I can with the attached tamper. 

Do you have any tips on how I can get the desired amount of espresso?

I’m a 24M, new to Munich, and going through a heartbreak. I'd rather not spend Valentine’s Day alone and could use a distraction so I don’t end up texting her. Doesn’t have to be anything romantic—just looking for something to do on Friday afternoon.

A little about me: I’m a CS master’s student and fit a lot of the stereotypes—I drink way too much coffee, play video games, and have long hair. But I also break quite a few of them. I love hiking, go to the gym regularly, enjoy cooking, and actually have decent social skills (or at least I’d like to think so). I also enjoy deep conversations and meeting new people, even if I tend to be a bit introverted at times.

I speak fluent German and English, so language won’t be an issue. If anyone’s up for an activity, let me know! Open to ideas.

I’ve been maintaining a chill weight with intuitive eating and regular exercise for about a year, but have my wedding coming up in 15 weeks and want to be at my lower body weight for it. It’s nothing seriously drastic, it would have been about 10 lbs of a difference, I just. Want to be small and lean and have visible muscle because it’s my wedding and I want the perfect stupid pictures. 

So three months ago, I increased my gym frequency from 3x/ week to 5x. Started being aware of my protein intake again and weighing on a weekly basis, trying to avoid the eating restriction spiral that I have a nasty habit of doing. I went from 130 to 135 in the first two months. And now I’m stuck there for the past, hovering between 133 and 137 day in and day out. Monday, 135. Tuesday, 132.8. Wednesday, 133.4. Thursday, 136.8. Friday, 137. And then by Sunday back down to 134 or whatever. It’s just. It’s so frustrating.

The time I got down to 121 I was vaping like a fiend and I’m so afraid that if I pick it back up to lose weight I won’t quit in time to not be craving it for my entire wedding. I just. So badly want the small. And now I’m 15 weeks out and have to lose 15 lbs and that’s not an ideal time frame for my mental wellness, but I downloaded lose it again, paid for the premium so it’s easier to use, and yet! Still not dropping weight. I started it last week, and my first weight was 135.0 flat. It’s not fluctuating like I described earlier, but it has gone up! Despite being 300-600 below my budgeted calories for the past 6 days! And im counting EVERYTHING, cooking oil- I measure it with teaspoons because I don’t trust my estimate of the spray, seasonings, I measure my milk in my coffee with a scale. 

I’m just venting and frustrated and I know it’s going to take more than a week of tracking to see results, but I’m so worried that I’m going to stay right at 135 and be 12 weeks out, then 10, then 5, and just. Spiral into a crash diet and nicotine even though that’s what I’ve been working so hard to avoid.

I’m about to turn 30 and my Dr told me I have Fibromyalgia,"Sitting here having my morning coffee still grasping everything that’s happened in my life. I turn 30 tomorrow and it’s weird aging when your body has never felt young. 
I want to first say that though it’s been a wild ride, I know so many people have such different and more challenging experiences. 

I was diagnosed with RA, dermatomyositis, and an interstitial lung disease at 11. Yeah, big words for a little girlie. My youth was spent going to the hospital for tests and check ups. So many tests. I was in prednisone from ages 12-16… best times to swell up like a ballon and have moon face.. s/. It’s crazy to look back on things, it feels life a different lifetime ago. 

Ive tried so many different meds. Im fully convinced I have ptsd from methotrexate. Getting the shots from my dad as a kid, and having to take it (and not working - making things worse) as an adult. 

Rinvoq truly changed my life. I started it just over a month ago and I have no signs of active RA at all. Though I still have the pain. On Friday my doctor told me the pain is fibromyalgia, brought on by 20 years of RA, makes sense. But honestly I’ll take it, it seems like nothing compared to what could be, what has been. 

Anyways, I just wanted to post my thoughts on here. Even though I have yet another diagnosis at not yet 30, I feel like I’ve finally come out of the woods. 

I hope you find your clearing soon and make it out of the woods too 💕

1in09my,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1in09my/i_think_i_am_starting_to_resent_my_younger_brother/,I think I am starting to resent my younger brother,"Hi all.
Context: I 19F have a younger brother 14M, and we live with our parents. We both have ADHD, however his is worse than mine. We have a cousin 9M who goes to the same boys’ school as him.

I fear I may be starting to resent my younger brother because of his actions and my parents actions. At family dinners (inc. me, aunt, uncle, cousin, grandmother, dad, brother, mother), I rarely ever get asked about my life or what I’m up to. And when it is, it’s only, “Did you go out last weekend?” Or, “Any new boyfriends?” Never anything actually interesting. I find that family dinner conversations often revolve around this boys’ school that my brother and cousin go to, as parents of the school are heavily involved. The conversation is always about what faculty member they saw that week, the interactions with the school, what sport my brother’s doing this term and what sport my cousin’s going to be doing (this school is very sports based). They often discuss events happening with the school, future subjects, etc. it’s all about this school that my cousin and brother go to. And anyone who can’t really find anything to say about it is left out, eg my mother and I. I find the discussion is rarely about anything else despite my aunty having gone to the same high school as me. It always feels like my younger brother is the golden child as he does many sports, is smart with maths and science and gets decent grades, whereas I was the opposite. I struggled severely in high school due to a lack of diagnosis. So I got shit grades. He got diagnosed when he was 7. But I’ve still managed to get into University, however no one seems to take any interest in me, and when I try to add to conversations I am constantly spoken over. It’s the most frustrating, isolating feeling in the world. I’m not asking for much. Just a fraction of the attention my brother gets. But my parents swear up and down that he “isn’t the golden child” but my Dad spends heaps of time with him whether it be at school events or just getting lunch together because they went to some event. When I try and speak to my Dad, most of the time he’s working (from home) and often has a pissed off tone when I try to speak with him. Even when he isn’t working, I just feel like a nuisance no matter what I do.

Another reason as to why I feel I’m starting to resent him, is he leaves his things everywhere around the house. His Warhammer models are all over the lounge room, the coffee table, the COUCH. His fucking clothes he bought from a couple weeks ago are still sitting on the couch as well. There is no space to sit. His school shoes, smack bang in the middle of the walkway in front of the couch. His school bags, and clothes all over the fucking hallway INTO the lounge. More Warhammer models on the dining table. He leaves his clothes outside the bathroom before he showers and he never picks them up unless reminded. He will take the last of something from a packet of food, and leave the empty box/packet in the fridge or pantry. He leaves his dirty plates and cups everywhere he sits/hangs out and never cleans up after himself. He leaves STRAWBERRY LEAVES on the dining table. The bin is only four fucking meters away!!!! My point is, he doesn’t clean up after himself. EVER. His shit is everywhere. And even when you tell him to clean up his mess, he does a half-ass job. He doesn’t even do washing or the dishes (we literally put dishes into the dishwasher so its barely even a chore). He leaves empty wrappers and cans everywhere. And it’s getting on my last nerve. When my parents are away, I must get up at 7 AM to wake him for school otherwise he. Will. Not. Wake. Up. He is fourteen. going on fifteen. I was getting myself ready in the mornings and escorted to the bus stop at 7 years old!!! (Escorted because we used to live in Mongolia, and in an apartment complex). I feel like I am going crazy. I understand he has ADHD but so do I! And I feel like I’m not insane to be frustrated about this because it gets to a point !!! Don’t get me wrong, he is lovely personality wise and caring. But oh. My. God. He is disorganised and everyone else is being punished for it.

Like today, he came home from school and asks me if his shoe box and gift cards are in my friend’s car (we took him with us to the shopping centre a couple days back). My dad asks as well. I text her, she checks her car, nothing. Frantic looking around the house and his shopping is still nowhere to be seen. I ask my friend to double check, and nothing. So my brother is freaking out and my Dad is getting frustrated as my brother spent about $600 that day. I asked him to recount his steps and try and remember where he could have placed it. He fucking raises his voice at me and starts yelling at me. I say back, “Do not raise your voice at me excuse me. I am just asking you to recount your steps”. And he responds, (and he does this annoying thing where he purposely makes his voice deeper) even louder “Well I lost $600 so sorry I’m not super calm rn” and My Dad chimes in, “(OP), you would be the same if it happened to you” with a raised voice as well. What the hell? I am just trying to help? And now I’m getting yelled at because this doofus has somehow now managed to lose his shopping TWICE? Because he forgot it somewhere??? And not to mention he invited himself??????? 

It’s just pissing me off. Everything is pissing me off. I get it, he has ADHD but that’s no longer an excuse. He will be an adult soon and needs to get his shit together. He’s a glorified iPad baby. ",1,1739285400.0,confessions,6,1.0,False

As someone who works from home and occasionally games in the same space, I was looking for a desk that could keep up with both my professional and personal needs. This desk delivers on many fronts, but as with anything, it has its quirks.

**Design & Comfort**  
The first thing that struck me was its modern aesthetic. The deep brown engineered wood paired with the black powder-coated metal frame gives it a sleek, understated look. It blends seamlessly into a variety of room styles, whether you’re going for a professional workspace or a cozy study nook. I found the height to be just right for my chair, and the ability to switch the L-shape orientation based on your room’s layout is a nice touch. However, the desk doesn’t come with any specific ergonomic features like wrist support, which might be a dealbreaker for some.

[Check CubiCubi DE-Y-XZJ-40GB price on Amazon.](https://decorgurus.com/product/cubicubi-de-y-xzj-40gb-desk-review-b09j4w7wtb/)

Its sturdy metal frame and the X-shaped crossbars add a sense of durability. I’ve leaned on this desk while reaching for things, and it’s held up well. Still, I wouldn’t call it indestructible since one reviewer mentioned theirs broke after an unfortunate fall. I guess, like other furniture, it’s not meant to double as a safety net!

**Size & Space**  
Measuring 40 inches wide and 27.5 inches deep, the desk is compact but surprisingly spacious for its size. The L-shaped design makes it ideal for small apartments or home offices, like my tiny studio. My dual monitors fit snugly, and there’s still room for my coffee mug and a small desk plant. That said, if you’re someone who needs a lot of surface area for paperwork or crafts, you might find this desk a bit limiting. The shelves and side pocket are lifesavers for keeping clutter to a minimum, especially when working with limited space.

**Functionality & Features**  
This desk comes with adjustable shelves and a storage bag, which I found incredibly useful for organizing my office supplies. One shelf is currently home to my printer, while the other holds books and a few decorative items. The fabric storage bag, though not the sturdiest, is perfect for stashing loose papers. A minor gripe is that the screws for attaching the pocket didn’t align perfectly, but with a little improvisation, it worked out fine.

Cable management could be better. There’s no dedicated hole or tray for wires, so my cords are a bit of a mess. I’ve had to use clips and ties to keep things somewhat organized. A built-in cable management system would have been a welcome addition.

**Assembly**  
Putting this desk together was a mixed bag. The instructions were clear, and all tools were included, which is a big plus. It took me about 40 minutes solo, though I did have to backtrack a couple of times. Pay attention to the orientation of the metal frame pieces because some holes need to line up for later steps. I’ve read that others had issues with screws or misaligned parts, but my experience was relatively smooth. If you’re assembling it alone, be prepared for a bit of trial and error.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish design fits well in small spaces.
* Reversible L-shape makes it versatile for different room layouts.
* Sturdy metal frame and X-crossbars provide decent stability.
* Shelves and storage bag offer practical organization options.
* Straightforward instructions with included tools for assembly.

**Cons**

* Lack of built-in cable management leaves wires messy.
* Assembly can be tricky due to alignment issues with some screws.
* Surface area may be too small for those needing extensive workspace.
* Fabric storage bag isn’t as durable as the rest of the desk.
* Not suitable for heavy-duty use or excessive weight.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When compared to other budget-friendly desks, the CubiCubi DE-Y-XZJ-40GB holds its own. For example, brands like SHW and Mr IRONSTONE offer similar L-shaped desks. SHW desks often come with built-in cable management and a slightly larger surface area, but they lack the sleek modern look of the CubiCubi. Meanwhile, Mr IRONSTONE desks are known for their sturdiness but don’t include handy features like a storage bag or reversible shelves. If aesthetics and compactness are your priorities, CubiCubi is a great choice, but for extra functionality, SHW might edge it out.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
For its price range, this desk provides a lot of bang for your buck. You’re getting a modern-looking, sturdy piece of furniture with practical features. While it’s not without its flaws, such as the lack of advanced cable management or a more robust storage bag, the overall value makes it worthwhile. I wouldn’t recommend it for someone needing a heavy-duty workstation, but for light to moderate use, it’s a great deal.

The thinness of the wood might make you question its long-term durability, but the metal frame helps to keep everything stable. Considering the price fluctuations on Amazon, it’s worth keeping an eye out for discounts to make it an even better deal.

1in03lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1in03lx/opinion_on_my_choice_to_end_a_friendship_kind_of/,opinion on my choice to end a friendship kind of,"i was quite shut down as a kid bwcause i was so conformistic and ashamed for being different and the athmosphere was quite traditionalistic and held in certain values and energies and i molded myself to fit in quite alot and felt very shut and i literally remember thinking they must not know who i truly am.  i was very sensitive to energies and also became quite codependent with my mom due to her depression i think and internalized some negative energies like low self confidence and parent's negative subconscious projections towards me and some pride too.

 in high school i spent the a lot of time alone focusing on singing and school and whatever and was becoming more of who i truly am and it was difficult because i lived in a small town and overall the people are so different from what i consider resonating to me. however i slightly gave into ppl pleasing again but I'm now realizing i no longer want to please or can't or otherwise I'm lying to myself and it feels suffocating. i want to let go the mask.

i have three friends atm that i very rarely see (we hung out mostly in 2019-2022). One of them is like, i met her through another friend and we met at parties. To depict our friendship, i occasionally was at her's for coffee and she also visited me a couple of times and we had a shared spotify playlist. i think we were a fit for a while because i was playing a role kind of or trying to create a false life because of a failure i had with singing in high school and because of some expectations i was trying to fill and validation i was trying to get and shame stuff overall. i begun to mimic friends that i didn't even at that point consider my people really but i began to dim myself and adjust my interests like the way i dress and overall opinions and vibe. however i've been realizing over 1,5 years how off track i am and i began to change drastically and follow intuition again. it's like I'm aging in reverse.

 I haven't been seeing the friends i mimicked but i saw the friend i had been visiting and had the playlist with (for the past few years we have been seeing maybe 4 times and talked a bit online maybe every 2months so we are not in close contact). i told her about some of my thoughts. While i feel like i want to be very drastically different from my family (like i always have been anyways) and seriously my true self, she is very much like she wants to be like her relatives or atleast she shares their vibe and values which are somewhat similar to at least that of my dad's side relatives. i told her I don't know if i want to be friends with her anymore because i feel like i want or need to be who i really am. she was very shocked and like ""i love you so much"" and like, do you not have any feelings for me which i feel was weird because i never considered us that close. like friends but i would never say i loved her.

 now I'm stuck thinking about if there is something wrong with me and i've tried to love her by mimicking my mothers love but it just feels wrong and off and I'm super angry but i keep shutting it down because im scared this is some trauma thing like what if I'm so traumatized i don't care for her or what if my anger is some kind of dysregylation but i think it is not i think it's just my truth and i feel like i want to move on we did close the friendship via a text but i feel guilty but also following the guilt or like continuing the friendship feels like I'm ingoring my truth and self sabotaging. you know she's not a bad person but just not my kind of person. she reminds me of the time as a kid when it was like ""ok"" but I'm just pleasing and avoiding my truths like having a tape over mouth, having to be very calm and kind or having to be the goofy or rough one but that's not who i want to be and I'm so tired of the ""oh but you can have multiple different sides to you"" stuff like no it frels outdated and i already lived that life and I don't want surround myself with people who mirror those energies and I'm not sure if she understands what i mean with my things. we have different interests and vibes and values.  i know about the ""you need to get along with everyone"" blah blah yeah but i seriously want to move on and get going with my life because especially when it comes to the singing i have serious potential and I'm very young. which is another thing because  she is very ""old"" and mother/auntlike even though we are the same age or at least in my opinion she has a vibe that reminds me of aunt type or some kind of ready to settle and fed up with life whereas i haven't even started. another thing is she really idealizes her mother because she died when she was a kid and really wants to be her byt i have a suffocating enmeshment situation with my mom which i want to destroy. anyways do you think my choice is okay? overall I don't love her but i keep on thinking about some old relatives or therapist kind of people judging me for not being loving enough or that i didn't have to say it that straight or that I'm overracting but I'd rather be honest and myself than just mimic some other person's love to be more fitting and i want a clean slate.

1in02p3,https://www.reddit.com/r/triathlon/comments/1in02p3/training_during_ramadan/,Training during Ramadan,"Hi there! wondering if there are any muslims/or anyone in this group who practice Ramadan? 

I am curious about training during this period. 

For those who don’t know - Ramadan is a religious month in the islamic calendar that will be roughly all of March. We fast each day for the full month. We cannot eat or drink anything, ingest nothing at all, including smoke, vitamins, etc (unless medically necessary) during sunlight hours. Yes, even water. 

We typically wake up before sunrise around 4/5am and have a big breakfast, coffee and LOTS of water and prepare to fast. At sunset we break our fast, usually my husband and I do a few dates & milk, then lots of water, then a big meal. We tend to eat more at night to make up the calories. 

That being said - training is very hard during Ramadan. I can and have worked out during the fast but no water is a STRUGGLE. My gym closes at 10pm so it’ll be a tight squeeze each night but not impossible. Weekend gym sessions will not happen because the gym closes at 8/7 on the weekends, so maybe just night runs? 

I feel like I can swim while fasted, I feel like being in the water will make me less thirsty than biking or running? 

My first ever tri event is in July. So I’ll essentially be taking a massive training break for a month, and hopping back in full speed in April.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I (27F) am a diehard romantic. Love candlelight dinner, loveletters, notes, surprise dates, bouquets. . . I have always been the one in all my relationships to put in efforts and do romantic things for my partner but was never on the recieving end. We (23M) have been dating for 2 years. He knows what kind of person I am and My love for romance.

The first year was a situationship and last year he confessed feelings. Since our dating days, he never took me out on a date or planned any surprise or got me any specific gift. On my bday he planned a party with the help of my friends. My bestie did majority of planning and my bf had rough ideas in his mind. But he took me shopping. I just loved the Princess treatement I got for the first time ever in my life. 

After that we went out twice, once on Christmas and another was a similar festival. But that too only after I pestered him several times and had to convince him that I wanna go out for a fancy meal somewhere. He was very reluctant to go out to a cafe or dinner but eventually gave in.

Last month on our anniversary I planned a surprise dinner for him at home. Decorated the room with flowers and cooked his face meal, and lit many candles, got him a little gift. He few days later got me a gift but agreed that he didn't think I would want a gift on our anniversary so he didn't buy any. 

I keep writing small notes and send it with his lunchbox. If he has mentioned something quite a few times..I would try to find it and get it for him. When working late night, I surprised him at his workplace during breaks with a coffee and snacks we can share. When I went to my hometown, I left messages and notes in his calendar so that during random times of the day it pops up on his screen and makes him smile. He went to another town for work and had a bad day, so I sent him his fav food delivery. But he has never done anything similar for me. Like he would do all basic responsibilities but never go out of his way to surprise me or win me over by any way. 

He loved all those things I did. And really appreciated me for them. Not only did he say it but the look on his face was clear about it. Later his bestie too mentioned a few times to me, how he keeps praising the acts I do for him. How it makes him feel loved. But then if he already understood its value I have no clue why he won't do the same for me.

This would be out first Valentine's together and I was really hoping he would plan something. I dropped several hints about how wish someone would do romantic things for me. He said he thinks it overhyped and he feels lazy to put in romantic efforts because afterall He is not so good with it and it's just waste of money. He regularly gets me flowers, but even after I hinted that I would love a rose on rose day, he didn't get me any. He stopped everything sweet that he did suddenly the moment I mentioned it's the Valentine's week, the time to celebrate surprises and romance. Later at night I gave him the rose I had earlier ordered for him. Same went for Chocolates Day. I had already got him his favourite chocolate and was waiting that he would get some for me too. But no. He didn't even wish. Eventually I gave him the choclate with a small note. I asked if we have any plans for Friday and he brushed it off saying he has work and things to do."" What's so special about Friday?"" And he even started acting kind of annoyed that I indirectly mentioned about my expectations of small acts of love. 

There is no other issues. He is really caring, understanding, reliable and responsible man. He helps with all chores, and supports my dreams and passion like none other.  But he just feels lazy to do anything surprising for me. Whenever I mention it, his answer - "" You are already mine. Those gifts are nothing compared to my feelings for you. These acts and gifts won't do justice to the love between us""

I don't know what to make of this. I have never directly sat down and spoke to him about my expectations I have from a relationship when I comes to romance or my dissatisfaction when he doesn't put in those efforts. But I dropped very evident clues, and brought it up in conversations enough for him to know. He ain't dumb, he is quite sharp, but he purposefully acts dumb when I drop evident hints. I really won't enjoy if I have to walk up to him and tell him specifically what I need, and then he does it out of obligation because I said I want it. It feels like I am constantly demanding things. But like it makes me feel so sad, that I never get to enjoy being on the recieving end of romantic things. How do bring up this conversation with him? Is there any other way to resolve it?

1imzq5l,https://i.redd.it/lzt2ufp2siie1.jpeg,Remember Why You Wrote It - Poetry Open Mic Series 2nd Thursday of the Month @ Dreams of Beans Feb 13th,"Remember Why You Wrote It! POETRY OPEN MIC SERIES on the SECOND Thursday of each month to complement the existing poetry slam events!

The first Remember Why You Wrote It! event will be February 13th - a chance to read old work, new work, or in progress stuff! Prep for the slam, or just read for the joy/catharsis of it!!

Event will proceed as follows: 7:00 PM is sign up for poets - the event will officially start at 7:30 and will be structured as open mic, then a short break to be followed by the featured poet, then more open mic!

It's not a competition, so no real rules except (of course) no hate speech or nudity, and poets should stick to reading a few shorter poems or one long one so everyone that wants to, gets a chance to read!

Please don't hesitate to reach out with questions or comments.

Dreams of Beans has generously offered to host the event so come and get your delicious snacks and coffee on while enjoying the talent that Ptbo/NOGO has to offer!

Please share widely and invite your friends!!

1imznn5,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManagedByNarcissists/comments/1imznn5/nboss_and_expense_reports/,Nboss and expense reports,"My nboss takes 3-4 months to approve small-dollar expense reports. I thought he was just disorganized, but he actually goes through and looks at every receipt.

My business trips are pretty lame. I buy groceries because I don't want to eat restaurant food for every meal. I don't drink. I take public transit from home to the airport and usually take it when I get to my destination. Probably the most ridiculous thing I've done is expense 15 cups of coffee in one day when I went to Asia when my daughter was a baby and I hadn't been sleeping.

I was at a conference with two other coworkers and we had dinner. I was the highest-ranking attendee, so I had to pay. This was downtown in a major city and dinner was $135 with tip. This was entirely within policy, but nboss sent my expense report saying dinner was too expensive and I needed to ""recalculate.""

I eventually figured out what happened. Workday pops up a warning when you exceed $30/person. But our policy is $50/person. I don't know why this is in Workday, but I literally had to show him corporate policy multiple times to get him to approve. I finally got the expenses paid 6 months after I submitted them. I asked why he was focusing on this when I travel so frugally. He tried to say that as soon as I showed him the policy, he approved.

I later had a trip to Mexico City. I took the subway to my hotel instead of a cab and it was $0.27. I expensed the $0.27 because it just seemed so ridiculous, but of course he never said anything.

At first, it didn’t seem like a big deal. A coffee here, an online subscription there... But then I checked my bank account and realized I had NO idea where half my money went. 😳

🚨 **What I learned:**  
✅ If you don’t track your spending, your money disappears FAST.  
✅ Small daily expenses add up way more than you think.  
✅ Avoiding finances doesn’t make money stress go away—it makes it worse.

The good news? Once I started **budgeting and tracking my expenses**, I felt in control again. I finally knew **where my money was going** and could actually start saving.
