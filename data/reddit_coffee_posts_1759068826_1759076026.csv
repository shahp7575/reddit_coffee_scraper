1nss7l8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1nss7l8/has_anyone_had_low_morning_cortisol/,Has anyone had low morning cortisol?,"I started my own business 5 years ago.  My levels of stress and ability to handle the stress was manageable the first year but I hit perimenopause and my ability to work through stressful situation diminished, anxiety skyrocketed and my mental health tanked.  For the last 4 years I've  been surviving on a hope and a prayer. Would wake up woth borderline panic attacks, go to bed with borderline panic attacks, and all day would be a sense of dread. I was dealing with a business that grew a ton, managing 10 employees, dealing with clients from 5 am to 9 pm.  I always put on a brave face and just kept keepin' on.  When the hot flashes got worse I went to a hormone clinic who did initial bloodwork.  Along with low hormones, elevated cholesterol and prediabetes, my morning cortisol came back low. The doctor i saw essentially said ""I think it was a lab error because had your cortisol been this low, you would've sought help due to inability to cope"".  I was so embarrassed that I never said anything in reply.  But honestly, most days i would think to myself ""omg, a 72 psych hold would be like a vacation"".  

We are going to re-test my morning cortisol in 3 months and so far, a week into BHRT I am noticing subtle differences in my mood and I've  made a lot of effort to create a more manageable morning routine. Before I would get up at 5 am, make a coffee and hop into the computer to start checking emails before heading into the office.  These last 2 weeks I get up, make a coffee, sit in the hot tub for 15 mins - 30 minutes, have breakfast and head itno the office. I now leave the work phone at the office and dont open my laptop with my work email until I get to the office.

Tried this month. Had a faint but positive pregnancy test but on 15 dpo my hcg was only 9, 2 days later bleeding started and blood test came back already >5. Called it a chemical pregnancy/very early loss.

I’m on cycle day 3(counting the first sign of blood from my chemical pregnancy as cycle day 1). Blood flow has seemed to go way down. Very heavy cycle day 1 and 2. For some reason I tested because whenever I’m close to ovulation, I get “more in the mood” and wanted to see. The urine used was pee about an hour after first morning pee, and had some coffee in between.

Wanted to see if anyone else thinks this looks like it’s getting darker or getting close to being a peak in the next week. And if anyone had ovulated very soon after a chemical pregnancy with levels already back to normal?

1nss6kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nss6kt/coffee_grinder_vs_mortar_and_pestle_real/,Coffee grinder vs mortar and pestle: real differences?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been diving deep into the world of coffee grinding lately, and I thought I'd share my experience comparing traditional mortar and pestle with modern coffee grinders. After years of making coffee at home, I've learned quite a bit about what works and what doesn't.

Let me tell you, I started my journey with a mortar and pestle because I thought it would give me that authentic, traditional feel. While it definitely has its charm, I quickly realized there's more to consider than just the romance of manual grinding.

The biggest difference I noticed is consistency. With a mortar and pestle, getting uniform grounds is like trying to paint a masterpiece blindfolded - possible, but incredibly challenging. Modern coffee grinders (I personally use this one: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) give you much more control over particle size, which is crucial for a good brew.

Time is another factor that really matters in my morning routine. Grinding enough beans for two cups using a mortar and pestle takes me about 5-7 minutes of constant work. With an electric grinder, it's done in seconds. When I'm running late for work, those extra minutes make a huge difference.

Let's talk about effort too. While there's something meditative about using a mortar and pestle, it's genuinely tiring. Your arm will feel it after a while. Electric grinders do all the heavy lifting for you. I've found this particularly helpful when making coffee for guests - nobody wants to spend 20 minutes just grinding beans!

Sound is worth considering too. A mortar and pestle is relatively quiet, making soft crushing sounds. Electric grinders are louder but quick. If you've got sleeping family members, this might matter to you.

When it comes to cleaning, mortar and pestle might seem simpler, but coffee oils can really stick to the surface. Modern grinders (like this one I use: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder) often have removable parts that make cleaning much easier.

Cost is pretty straightforward - a decent mortar and pestle costs less upfront, but considering the time and effort saved, I think a good electric grinder is worth the investment. Plus, consistent grounds mean better coffee extraction, so you're actually getting more value from your expensive beans.

Here's what really sealed the deal for me: flavor extraction. Consistent grounds mean even extraction, which leads to better-tasting coffee. With a mortar and pestle, I often ended up with a mix of fine powder and chunky bits, resulting in both over and under-extracted flavors in the same cup.

Don't get me wrong - I still keep my mortar and pestle around. It's great for grinding spices and can be a fun way to make coffee when I'm not in a rush. But for daily use? My electric grinder has become an essential part of my coffee routine.

Bottom line: if you're serious about your coffee, an electric grinder is the way to go. The consistency, convenience, and quality improvement make it worth every penny.

For about a year now I have been taking concerta. It has worked great and overal during the day made me feel a lot more calm emotionally, and I'm finally able to keep up with routines.

The effectiveness has started to wear off a little though. I have also been dealing with a lack of motivation and fatigue when the meds wear off in the evening, causing me to lose any energy and motivation to do my usual hobbies, like reading or drawing, or more productive things like learning a new skill. It's very frustrating and drinking coffee is simply not an option in the evening. I'll just not sleep and make things worse the next day.

That was me, every single morning for months.

I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, and bam—anger hits first, then this heavy sadness that makes my eyes burn. I’d wipe tears fast before my partner woke up ‘cause I was scared to say anything. Every time I did try to talk about it? We’d fight. Not yelling, just that quiet, awful arguing where no one feels heard. And the worse part? The more I loved them, the more it hurt. I’d catch myself thinking, Why did I have to find out about this? I’d give anything to unknow.

It spiraled. Their ex’s name felt like it was stuck in my head—heard a song they used to like on the radio? Instant panic. Saw a photo from a trip they took together? I’d zone out for an hour, overthinking why wasn’t I there? I’d see couples gush about being each other’s firsts and just… sink. Not even mad at them, just sad. Like, why can’t that be us? Is it weird that I want that?

I tried the “just let it go” thing a million times. Told myself, “It’s the past, it doesn’t matter.” Worked for maybe 20 minutes. Then I’d see something silly—like a coffee shop they used to go to—and I’d be right back to square one. I started pulling away, acting cold for no reason. Snapped at them once ‘cause they mentioned a old friend (who wasn’t even the ex!) and I felt terrible after. We were both so tired of it.

On top of that, I was stuck on all the stuff I’d seen online—takes about what “good” relationships “should” look like, comments that made me feel like my feelings were “stupid” or “overdramatic.” I let that noise seep in, like, Am I being crazy for hurting this much?

Full transparency: I study psychology (PhD student) and work as a counselor, so I knew this wasn’t something I had to live with forever. But knowing and doing are two different things. I tried journaling—wrote pages of angry, messy notes and felt nothing. Talked to a mentor, did mindfulness tricks when the jealousy spiked… most of it flopped. I got so frustrated I thought, Maybe I’ll just never get over this.

But I kept messing with it. Tweaked the journaling—instead of just “I’m sad,” I wrote when it hit (mornings, mostly, or when we watched old movies) and what triggered it (that stupid coffee shop!). Slowly, like, really slowly, it got easier. The thoughts still pop up sometimes, but now I can go, “Oh, that’s just the jealousy talking”—and then turn to my partner and ask about their day instead of spiraling.

Since then, I’ve sat with a few people going through the same thing. Never tried to “fix” them—just listened, and said, “I get it. I’ve been there. You’re not alone.” That’s all I wanted when I was stuck, y’know?

I used to think I’d be stuck in that pain forever. But healing’s weird—it doesn’t happen all at once, and that’s okay. If you’re in this right now? I see you. That ache you’re feeling? It doesn’t have to be your norm. And you don’t have to carry it alone.

I’ve been on a long recovery journey lately, one issue I’m noticing though is that i lie *a lot.*

I have been trying to work on it. But whenever i feel vulnerable or threatened I lie. Lying to get out of trouble is one thing, but i lie about stupid things too. Stuff that doesn’t even matter. Ie: I’ve let certain people think i drink coffee when i don’t. Or about the food that i do or don’t like. 
It’s been an issue since i was a kid, and now i’m realizing that i don’t know myself very well because of all those lies. I would like advice on how to stop. I know that i do it, but now i need to learn how to stop doing it, and i’m kinda struggling with that part.

For added context if it’s at all relevant I was sexually abused in my childhood. Never raped, never penetrated. But i got a lot of unwanted online attention from adults as well as having a father who’d touch me sometimes. 
I have been diagnosed with cptsd and since then have been doing what i can to improve. I have come such a long way, but it’s time to keep working on myself. I’m tired of living a life that doesn’t feel like mine.

Any tips to not make it come off weird or creepy? I feel like I’m subjectivity attractive so it may not come off as creepy but still since I never had a real one on one with her.

On the side, I usually hit the gym, sometimes play basketball, and I’m always down for good music. I love cooking, can’t live without coffee & matcha, a sneaker head, and a lowkey F1 fan 🏎️.

I left a Fortune 500 in May. 3 months later, I landed a new job: fully remote (culture-based), promo with pay/title, and work/life balance. 

I can’t help you land or get a job. I’m no hiring manager or recruiter. But, I can share my method:

1) Use AI to update your resume, and a resume proofer (if you have funds) to help after. Google  Gemini is great. Matt Fisher on LinkedIn is a fantastic person, and doesn’t charge an arm/leg. And no, I am not getting kickbacks from him or Google - just part of my method. 
2) Update your LinkedIn. 
3) Open your LinkedIn to recruiters. Start becoming wary of who is a spam recruiter and who is not. 
4) Max out the Easy Apply function to jobs in your area, per day (LinkedIn). 
5) Apply to jobs that post in the last 1 hour. There are filters on LinkedIn to show you which have been posted in the last 24 hours. This includes weekends. 
6) Send an InMail/message, cold, to connections after applying. This means “people you may know” on LinkedIn, have attended the same school, or worked at the same place. Craft a message template that includes who you are (XX impacted by RTO mandate), what impact you’ve done (moved XX users to achieve XX% adoption), link of job you applied to, and how you’re seeking any kind of support. Keep it simple, and attach a PDF of your well-updated resume. 
7) Use AI to interview prep. Integrate culture or company mottos into your interview answers. 
8) Have coffee, energy drinks, etc. before your interviews. Final rounds are partly about seeing if you are somebody people want to work with. 
9) Have GOOD different questions prepared for each round of interviewers. 

Good luck!

**Why This Pick?**

The Giants come into this game with way too much uncertainty for my liking. With Wilson benched and Jaxson Dart getting the start, I think it’s going to take a small miracle for the Giants to get the better of Justin Herbert and one of the league’s best defenses. Los Angeles is a very respectable 3-0 coming into this encounter, and I don’t think New York has the chops to change that (at least, not yet). I’m on the Chargers to cover on the road.

Hello. 

I’m sorry, I’m so unfamiliar with this, but I hope someone can give me advice.

This is a very raw story, and it doesn't paint my younger self in a good light at all. But I want to be honest so that you have a clear picture and can hopefully help me as I break away from my abusive family. 

Just before Covid, my colleague’s dog got pregnant unexpectedly, and she needed someone to take the puppies. I bought Ombra, a highly energetic, intelligent, beautiful grey and black cockapoo. She had gotten stuck in the birth canal and, during the emergency C-section, her leg was damaged, leaving her unable to move it at birth. Because of this, no one wanted her, fearing she would lose the leg. My mother is a complicated woman. She is definitely a narcissist, but she jumps at the chance to “be the hero” and goes above and beyond to prove how caring she is when it suits her. Truthfully, I manipulated this quality to ensure Ombra was given a home. My colleague wanted £450 for her to help pay towards the medical bills for her dog, and so I bought Ombra for my mother five years ago. Thankfully, as Ombra grew over the initial 7-weeks, her leg repaired itself and she didn't need any further care. 

At the time, I was so focused on helping my colleague and getting Ombra a home that I didn’t think about what it would mean for the future. I was still in denial about my mother and how abusive she was. I had just finished my undergraduate degree, moved out because of how difficult it was living with her, was working a zero-hour contract on an acute mental health ward, had no money, and Covid was just starting. I eventually had to move back home due to the isolation and fear that if I caught Covid, I wouldn’t be able to pay my bills. 

It’s funny how three years of space while at university suddenly shows you just how abusive and narcissistic your mother really is when you move back in as a fully independant adult. Because of ongoing financial issues, I couldn’t leave again and instead saved to do my master’s. All I did was work and sleep to save and escape my mother as much as possible. I finally left in 2022, just as one of our family dogs passed away. That loss made me realise just how blind I had been — how focused on survival I was, and how neglected our dogs actually were. I think it's normal for everyone to want more time with a deceased loved one. To have regrets and wish they could go back and show just how much they loved someone. Nero, one of my older dogs, died from cancer and a deteriorating spine. He hid it and suddenly became very sick over a weekend when I was setting up my uni accommodation. When I returned, he was gone. It dawned on me how little Nero and Luce (Nero's brother) had been walked and how little enrichment outside of the home they actually had. 

I had walked them as an adolescent, but once A-Levels and university took over, I was the only one who had ever done so — and when I couldn’t, they simply weren’t walked. I was the only one who groomed them, too, since my family wouldn’t take them to professionals. Their fur would get matted until I noticed and cut it out, clipped their nails, trained them, gave them love and attention. When I confronted my family about this, their attitude was that “they have the garden” (yes, we have a fairly big garden, but it’s not enough). This made me realise Ombra hadn’t been walked or socialised either. The few times I’d taken her out after shifts showed me just how reactive she had become. My family excused it as “because of Covid,” and then later justified not walking her by saying her reactivity made it impossible. 

While doing my master’s, I came home often to work and earn money, and during those times I worked hard to walk Ombra and Luce. Luce was fine thanks to the socialisation I gave him as a teenager, but Ombra was terrified and reactive. I persisted, and over time she improved — she got to the point where she could walk on the beach off-lead, sniff other dogs and people out of curiosity, and then come back to me calmly. If scared, she’d sit by me rather than lunge or snarl. I can’t express how much effort I put into this, and how proud I was to give both dogs the enrichment they deserved. Those walks became healing for me too: searching for sea glass, sitting with a book and coffee while they had sausages from the beachside café, simply giving them joy while I regained some peace from my mother’s presence. 

Then I had my accident. I broke my leg and severed my ACL ligament. I was housebound for five months and couldn’t walk the dogs for six. During this entire time, my mother didn’t take them out once. She works for herself, spends most of her time in her room watching Netflix or right-wing propaganda on YouTube, and yet she refused. I begged her to take them out. The dogs begged me — excited at first, then eventually giving up. I can’t tell you what hurt more: their begging, or watching them give up. I couldn’t afford a dog walker on my zero-hour job, wasn’t receiving sick pay, and was reluctant to seek benefits. My friends lived too far away, and my family wouldn’t help, despite promising. 

Whilst I was still on crutches, as soon as I could get to the floor and up again safely, I groomed them myself — shaving their matted coats, clipping nails, brushing as best I could. As soon as I was strong enough to handle being pulled on the lead, I was back to walking them. Thankfully, Ombra didn’t regress, and we returned to our routine. 

That injury period also showed me just how bad my mother really is. She left me collapsed in doorways. She wouldn’t shop for me (I would be paying for my shopping out of my savings), cook, or even fetch me water. I often skipped meals because I couldn’t physically cook and wasn’t allowed to use her food. She tried to start physical fights with me when I was disabled, forcing me to threaten calling the police. I recorded interactions out of fear, until it was revealed she had a key to my room, and stole and destroyed my dictaphones. She locked the living room and sun lounge so I couldn’t use them, leaving me with only the kitchen, a small guest bedroom, and the bathroom. 

Despite that, I found a good job while recovering and now have had surgery to repair my knee. I should be walking within two months (worst-case scenario). My plan is to work a full year in this role (until May 2026), then move out permanently — ideally to Scotland with a friend who is also wishing for a new start. She’s a groomer with two well-socialised dogs, and I know Ombra would thrive with us. 

The problem is: 

\- Luce is old (almost 14) and attached to my mother. His health is declining, and as much as I love him, I know he belongs with her until the end. Taking him away would be too distressing for him. And as awful as it sounds and as devastated as I will be, I hope he passes soon. Both, so he doesn't suffer as he gets older, and because I don't want to leave him with a poor quality of life at his end. 

\- Ombra is still young, very bonded to me, and needs proper care, grooming, enrichment, and socialisation like any other dog. If I leave her behind, she’ll go back to being neglected. 

I asked my mother would she get another dog if Luce passed, to which she said no (Thank the Gods). But I asked if I could take Ombra with me when I move (she doesn't know that I am severing my ties with her), but my mother insists Ombra should stay because she’d be “alone during the week while I work.” But the truth is, she’d have my friend’s flexible schedule, two other dogs for company, and proper walks and love. My mother refuses to acknowledge this. When I highlight what I do for Ombra that they don't, my mother's response was, ""she will be properly loved"". 

Did you scoff? I know I did just by reading that again. 

My concern is that my mother will refuse to let me take Ombra. Legally, where do I stand? 

I bought Ombra, but my mother has paid for her vet bills. I’ve done the actual care, training, grooming, and exercise. Can I take Ombra with me, even if my mother refuses? I don't want to leave her here knowing that she won't have the proper love and care she needs and deserves. 

I have spent many years of my life ""waking up"", healing and building resources and courage to leave this situation. I can't stay here any longer than I have already planned.

Please... can someone help me save my dog? Or do I have to save myself and leave Ombra?",1,1759074845.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

1nsrq3a,https://i.redd.it/jrgzu2lufxrf1.jpeg,"First impressions on 19 fragrances, including Kilian, Xerjoff, SHL, Roja Parfums and more","Finally starting to get more samples again and this will be the first of a few posts I'll make over the next couple of weeks. Full disclosure I've already smelled and worn Black Phantom and Angels' Share so I'm not including them, they just came alongside the rest of the Kilian samples from a discovery set.

**Kilian**

• *Sacred Wood* - Very strong sandalwood scent in the air almost immediately, this is a hair's width away from smelling pickle-y like Santal 33. Up close I can't smell it too much, kind of like Santal 33 after I smelled my first whiff of it. It does have an airy, clean and slightly lactonic finish and a touch of amyris. Not my favorite Kilian but it's nice. 8/10

• *Angels' Share Paradis* - Slightly sweeter than the og in the air, I can also smell a candied berry note. Up close this is quite syrupy, not as similar to the og as I thought. I don't like how syrupy it is, but it seems to subside after a short while so I'll have to see how this wears. 6.5/10

• *Angels' Share On The Rocks* - Citrusy and even slightly fizzy in the air, pretty fresh with a sweet undertone. I'm getting way more citruses now compared to when I tried it (nose fatigued) in store. The opening is completely different from og and Paradis. I might like this one the most of the three, not to mention the frosted bottle looks gorgeous. 8/10

• *Old Fashioned* - Smells sweet in the air, almost like cherry Dr. Pepper. Up close it does smell whiskey-ish but I get strong cola/Dr. Pepper vibes off this for some reason, unlike when I tried it in store and it smelled like very rɛalistic whiskey. I also get immortelle's maple syrupiness in the background. I'll definitely have to try it out more. 8/10

• *Born To Be Unforgettable* - Fizzy lime scent in the air, it kind of makes me think of a Lacoste I used to wear a few years ago. Something up close smells rɛally funky, I get the same reaction I get when I smell calone. It does smell like cola and lime but whatever else is in this smells very bad. I don't like this at all up close. 3/10

• *Can't Stop Loving You* - Clean white floral scent in the air. Pretty nice orange blossom scent with a touch of honey. Simple but very well done. Might be unisex but barely. 8/10

• *Love Don't Be Shy* - Like CSLY but candied, kind of bubblegummy. Overall kind of similar to CSLY but with more notes, some vanilla and a touch of iris. The sweeter edge to this smells a bit screechy so I don't like it as much. This one is definitely feminine and not as strong on paper. 6/10

Hopefully Kilian adds more fragrances to choose from for their customizable discovery set, as they currently offer samples for about half of their entire lineup (not to mention a lot of them are sold out). There are still plenty of Kilians I'd like to try and their set would probably be the best way to try them value-wise.

**Stéphane Humbert Lucas 777**

• *God of Fire* - Spicy mango, Vulcan Feu does replicate it extremely well. Up close it's definitely better than Feu, it's softer and better blended, nowhere near as abrasive. There's definitely some berries here that are missing on the French Avenue. I'm comparing it to Vulcan Feu because I owned it as a catch and release, but generally it's a limey mango scent with so much ginger it's spicy. There's no oud or cypriol in the opening. 6/10

• *Sand Dance* - Sweet and powdery cacao in the air. This is more up my alley, slightly boozy cacao with sandalwood and tonka. I wish this had more citruses to be honest. This is reminding me a lot of Xenial from Navitus Parfums but this is far better. 8/10

• *Ô Hira* - Smells kind of mineralic, dusty and incensey in the air but also somewhat sweet, it's very interesting. Up close this is very ambery and has a lot of cinnamon, slightly leathery, very likeable considering the notes'. 8/10

• *Oumma* - Very balsamic rose in the air, it smells dirty but not because of the oud. It smells old, like a place that's full of old books and papers and maybe some moisture issues. I don't think this is palatable. 4/10

Although I didn't like Oumma and I'm not a fan of GOF, I'm still interested in trying out more from SHL, especially Crying of Evil and Mortal Skin, so I'll see if I can find samples for those.

' Fragrantica only has ambergris listed as the top, heart and base notes, but Ô Hira's note breakdown is pyrogenic styrax, earthy notes, leather, woody notes, saltpeter, amber, cinnamon, tonka bean, torrefied vanilla and musk.

**Brioni Eau de Parfum Éclat** - Super nice juicy and musky grapefruit. The rose is in the background and it blends nicely. Looking forward to trying this out. 8.5/10

**Beso Beach Parfums Beso de Fuego** - It's alright I guess. Smokey and green jasmine, slightly leathery too even though it doesn't list leather as a note. 6/10

**ELDO Divin'Enfant** - The sample from my discovery set leaked completely so I bought a replacement. Fluffy and soapy in the air, a bit candy-like and I can definitely smell the orange blossom. It's a musky, airy and sweet orange blossom scent, slightly soapy. At least on paper I don't get any tobacco, leather or coffee. 8/10

**Roja Parfums Amber Aoud** - Sweet and jammy rose, I can also smell the ylang-ylang and jasmine in the distant background. I don't get any oud or ambergris on paper. It's also strong, it radiates a lot off the decant's atomizer if I don't leave the cap on. 8/10

I'm interested in trying more from Roja's Aouds but the price of the discovery set puts me off a little ($90+ for 7 × 2 ml samples), maybe in the future.

**Xerjoff**

• *Mefisto* - Smells extremely similar to Silver Mountain Water in the air, just more citrusy. Up close it's more airy, green and floral instead of ""inky"" but they're undoubtedly similar. I don't like when people use percentages to say how similar two fragrances are but I'd say this is like 70% similar to the Creed. I'll look for a sample of Gentiluomo to compare. 9/10

• *Golden Moka* - Smells like slightly acidic citruses with a touch of coffee and musk in the air. Up close the citruses are very prominent, but there's also a green and floral facet to the scent. I don't rɛally get much coffee or oud out of this. The citruses here make me think a bit of Renaissance. 7/10

• *Nio* - Clean and green bergamot and neroli in the air. There's definitely some vetiver and spices up close, but it's mostly green, it almost smells like eucalyptus. I think it's reminding me of Memo's Moon Fever but I haven't smelled that in a while. I prefer lighter green scents. 7/10

• *Via Cavour I* - Peachy, chocolatey, a bit rosey, definitely sweet but not as much as the average gourmand scent. There's a slight medicinal oud under all the notes, but it's not intrusive or misplaced. I also think the oud keeps it unisex, without it it might lean into a completely feminine territory, and it's only getting more oudy as it dries. It's not that strong on paper. 8/10

The next posts will include a lot of Xerjoff fragrances, I'm getting samples for a few dozens of them.",1,1759074576.0,Colognes,0,0.99,False

1nsroa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeRigged/comments/1nsroa0/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_by_zwilling/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle by ZWILLING Enfinigy Worth It,"ZWILLING 53101-201 Electric Kettle

Using the ZWILLING 53101-201 has genuinely changed how I approach my mornings. This electric kettle smoothly fits into my kitchen routine while adding a surprising level of elegance to my countertop. It's not just an appliance; it's like having a little piece of advanced design sitting there, waiting to show you what it can do. The glossy black finish and compact form make it visually appealing, and the promise of ""cool touch"" intrigued me. Trust me, if you’ve ever accidentally grazed a hot kettle, you know that feature is a game-changer.

**A Practical Design That Delivers Daily Convenience**

The design of this kettle is one of my favorite aspects. Double-walled insulation isn’t just a fancy bullet point—they mean it. The outer layer stays cool, no matter how hot the water is inside. As someone who’s clumsy before their first cup of tea, I was pleasantly surprised to avoid those accidental burns. The protective lid opens at a 70-degree angle too, which prevents any steam clouds from hitting my hand when pouring. It holds 1.5 liters—a perfect size for anything from one large pot of coffee to multiple servings of tea during a book club meeting. 

[Check ZWILLING 53101-201 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b08ncd98hg/)

**Smooth Performance That’s Reliable**

Performance-wise, it heats water faster than I care to admit compared to my old stovetop kettle. It even cuts through cold mornings without making you wait ages for steam. The stainless steel inner surface ensures no weird plastic taste seeps into the water, which unexpectedly became one of the things I look for in kettles now. Even the seams inside are smooth, making it ridiculously easy to clean. Less scrubbing, less fuss—what’s not to like? This kettle is powered by 1500 watts, which gets the job done without drawing excessive electricity.

**Strengths**

- Exceptional double-walled insulation for added safety and heat retention  
- Easy, residue-free cleaning thanks to seamless stainless-steel interior  
- 1.5-liter capacity suits both individual and group settings  
- Quick heating with impressive 1500-watt performance  
- Stylish and compact design that complements modern kitchens  

**Areas for Improvement**

- The black finish looks high-end but can attract fingerprints  
- A slightly larger lid opening would make it even easier to fill with water  
- Absence of advanced temperature control settings for tea enthusiasts  

**Sustainability and Durability**

I’ve noticed this kettle feels quite sturdy. At just under three pounds, it’s lightweight enough to maneuver but doesn’t feel cheap. It’s clear the kettle is built with long-term use in mind. Plus, hidden cord storage in the docking base keeps everything tidy, staying true to the sleek design elements. If there’s one thing to nitpick, it’s that the kettle isn’t dishwasher-safe. However, “hand wash only” is pretty standard for such high-quality kitchen appliances.

**Competitive Options**

There are definitely other strong contenders in the electric kettle market. Fellow’s Stagg EKG and Breville’s Smart Kettle both cater to more premium audiences, offering temperature control options that hardcore tea lovers may find tempting. But they come with a price tag that reflects it. The ZWILLING kettle, while lacking in extra bells and whistles, manages to strike a balance between affordability and performance. Honestly, unless you’re incredibly specific about tea brewing temperatures for different leaves, the absence of this feature won’t bother you. Compared to its most affordable competitors, this kettle’s durability and hygiene-focused design (I’m looking at you, stainless steel!) clearly set it apart.

**Cost Efficiency**

The price point of the ZWILLING kettle feels justified when balancing style, ease of use, and performance. While cheaper alternatives like plastic kettles exist, spending on something you know will last longer is smart. You’re not just paying for a water-boiler; you’re investing in convenience, style, and a product that genuinely makes mundane tasks like waiting for your tea so much better. I’d say this kettle falls in the sweet zone for affordable quality. It works exceptionally well, looks great sitting out, and doesn’t overwhelm you with unnecessary tech.

1nsro0h,https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/comments/1nsro0h/unpopular_opinion_most_language_learning_apps_are/,Unpopular opinion: Most language learning apps are cultural colonialism disguised as education,"**TL;DR:** Most apps teach you to be a tourist in your own culture. I think language learning should actually help you reconnect with your heritage.

I’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I need to put it out there.

Mainstream language apps keep giving us the same recycled “The cat drinks milk” and “My name is John” phrases. Meanwhile, millions of diaspora kids want to reconnect with their roots — and the apps give us nothing about real heritage.

Your grandma didn’t talk to you about cats drinking milk. She told you stories about ancestors, explained why certain foods matter, or taught you how to show respect at festivals. But language learning has been stripped of that and turned into something sterile and Western-focused.

A few examples:

* Duolingo teaches you to order coffee, but not how to greet your elders.
* You learn random vocab, but not naming conventions in your culture.
* You get “hello” and “goodbye,” but not the meaning behind greetings.
* Zero context about clothing, customs, or history.
* No connection to authentic products or community.

That frustration pushed me to build something different called Modatongue — where language and culture are inseparable. Instead of random phrases, you learn through cultural categories like History, Food, Clothing, Prominent People, Customs & Traditions, Music & Dance, Naming Conventions, and Festivals. There’s also live tutoring with native speakers, curated cultural content, community spaces to connect with others, and even a marketplace for authentic heritage products.

Maybe it’s harder to “add culture” when learning English or French. But for most heritage languages, culture and language are so intertwined that separating them feels incomplete.

Am I crazy, or should culture always be part of language learning? Have you felt this same disconnect with mainstream apps?

The taxes are out of control.,"I paid $21 for a one pound bag of coffee beans yesterday.  Coffee is the one thing I won’t give up. I’ve cut back to two cups a day. Any ideas for lower cost espresso beans? I didn’t vote for this.  I’ve tried Trader Joe’s, Aldi’s and Costco beans. I’m looking for decaf espresso (I know that sounds like an oxymoron)              Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! Thanks! (I’m trying to get to the minimum 300 characters for my post.)

Got my role in “Sales” as an ENT BDR, after 5+ years at banks in my late 20s. You can probably tell where I am from the username. 

Anyway, after 4 months, what I realised is that I really suck at meeting quotas, unable to ask good enough questions so that it qualifies as an opportunity, and do not know enough about the products to really sell. 

However, I think I am really good at “making friends” with the decision-makers, and the executives. What I mean is, I will call someone ask them a few random questions, and they usually agree to have coffee with me. I have gotten many contacts and conversations with these people in my 4 months here, 3 CEOs and a few execs in the territory. However, they seem more keen to find out about me than the product. 

After meeting them, I usually just drop them a “thank you” message and say to reach out if they are ever keen to work with me. But beyond that, I do not know how I can keep them warm, and turn into something for me. 

Any advice? ",3,1759074217.0,techsales,3,1.0,False

1nsrjrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1nsrjrs/we_dont_see_lines/,We don't see lines,"Great Basin NP has a cave tour that sells out weeks in advance. The park also has 'day of' tickets but you have to arrive early and they can only be purchased at the visitor center. I was warned by a ranger to arrive early since the tour sells out quickly.

I arrive at 6:30 am and I'm fifth in line. Over the next hour and a half the line continues to grow with people drinking coffee, eating muffins, happily chatting as they wait. 

Shortly before the doors open, a young couple sits on the wall near the doors. Nobody says anything because there's lots of reasons why people are going into the visitor center early including hike advice, campground reservations, grab a map etc. 

The ranger comes out and announces that she has 40 tickets and asks if anyone already has reservations. None of us do. She then opens the door and we file in. Young couple goes in behind me. I get my ticket and scoot to the side to see if the young couple has other business.

Nope. They want tour tickets. I looked at the ranger and said they had cut in front of 20 or so other people waiting in line. She just shrugged and said ""well, that's not my job"". The man actually said ""we didn't know there was a line. People had chairs and were talking..."". 

I looked at them both and replied ""you knew there was a line and you are horrible people for cutting in front. Some of us have been here since 6:30."". The woman had the nerve to give me that affronted 'how dare you say that to me!' face and I walked away.

I'm beginning to understand why 'entitled people' is such a topic of conversation.",16,1759074149.0,EntitledPeople,1,1.0,False

I’m now graduated and I still have that problem. Also when I would come home I went straight to my bed. I do work now and I do the same after my shift. I don’t have a car yet nor do I have friends to hangout with. my family doesn’t go anywhere but to the store occasionally and to take me to work. like we dont do activities. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t even feel like going for a walk. mainly because i’ve lived this same boring ass neighborhood all my life and it’s nothing i’d enjoy seeing anymore. I think I need change of scenery because when I stayed with my relatives for summer I got up feeling refreshed. brushed my teeth every morning, took walks, showered etc.  I’m not 100% sure but its my guess.. So how do I motivate myself without being able to have a change of scenery? (energy drinks and coffee don’t help) ",2,1759074141.0,productivity,2,1.0,False

1nsrim7,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenOnThePen/comments/1nsrim7/adding_daily_inulin_to_weekly_maintenance_dose_to/,Adding Daily Inulin To Weekly Maintenance Dose To Go Lower,"I've been on maintenance for 6 months with enough MJ to see me though until mid 2026. Maintaining within a few hundred grams a day with no cravings and dosing once a week. I decided to try and drop a few more kg purely for aesthetic and body shape purposes but didn't want to up my dose and reduce my MJ ' stash '. So I've added 5g daily of soluble fibre in the form of Inulin dissolved into my morning coffee. Oh my goodness it's like being back on a huge dose of MJ, zero appetite, feeling full all the time and forcing myself to eat again. A tin of mackerel on sourdough feels like an all you can eat buffet and I'm full for hours. Anyway don't take advice from me and your results may vary, no side effects experienced and I'll see if the weight comes down further. Definitely not cross posting to the maintenance sub, I think they're all a bit mad in there 😄",2,1759074076.0,MenOnThePen,0,1.0,False
1nsrhp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nsrhp1/ghosted_and_confused_after_a_seemingly_great/,Ghosted and confused after a seemingly great first date,"Went out for coffee a couple of days ago and the vibes felt good. Conversation flowed, we had a lot in common, and there weren’t any awkward silences. When things were winding down, we left together, she gave me her phone so I could call mine, and before parting ways we said we should meet again.

That night I texted her saying I had a great time and would like to see her again when she’s free. I never got a response.

It just feels odd because we were texting consistently on Hinge before the date, and during the date she seemed into me, laughing, good eye contact, body language seemed positive. From my perspective it went well, but now I’m second guessing myself.

We’re still matched on Hinge, but I haven’t heard a word back since that night. Am I misreading the situation, or is this just a case of her not being interested?",3,1759074019.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1nsrg2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1nsrg2y/got_broken_up_with_someone_i_love_due_to_be_in/,"Got broken up with someone I love due to be in different stages, now I want to improve my life. Any advice or similar stories?","So I met someone. She was special—really special. The kind of person who helped me grow in ways I’m still unpacking. I struggle with OCD and childhood trauma, and a year ago, I lost my mom. It’s been a tough chapter, but meeting her was a bright, unexpected turning point. We connected through a mutual friend who mentioned she had a crush on me after seeing me in a play. Funny enough, we were cast in a show together—and before we could make a move in person, we matched on Hinge. Things just clicked. She kissed me on the first date. We liked the same music, shared similar values, and had a real connection rooted in mutual care and empathy.

She’s from Brooklyn—very direct and confident. At first, that intimidated me, but over time I began to love that about her. In fact, I began to love a lot of things that used to scare me because of my anxiety and OCD. She helped me see that I could trust, soften, and feel safe.

She taught me a lot—about cooking, about emotional regulation, about showing up for someone. I loved her deeply, and I still do. She was my biggest supporter, always cheering me on, even through the hardest moments. I’ve grown so much in the last year—especially since my mom’s death in 2024—and I credit a lot of that to her.

But a week ago, we broke up.

She works an incredibly demanding job with children, one of whom is seriously ill. And while she’s incredibly strong, I think the emotional weight of her work, combined with where I am in life, became too much. I’m still figuring things out—financially, emotionally, mentally. I’m in therapy, doing the work, and making progress. But I’m not there yet. I work part-time (with hours cut recently), deal with anxiety, and don’t have the clearest career direction. I rely on my dad for rent support, but he’s not someone I can lean on emotionally. My living situation—with roommates who are still very much in the chaotic, starving-artist phase—has been a challenge as I’ve been trying to mature and move forward. All of this weighed on the relationship. I think she saw I’m in a different phase of life. And I see it too. We cried during the breakup. She said how proud she was of me, even then. She wasn’t cruel or unreasonable—just honest. Her life is full of stress, and I know she needed to lighten her emotional load. I’m not angry. I don’t have fantasies of getting back together. But I do love her. I miss her. And I’m so incredibly grateful.We agreed to 30 days of no contact before meeting briefly to return some things—maybe over coffee. We also volunteer for the same organization, so our paths may cross again. But I’m not chasing reconciliation. I’m chasing healing. This relationship held up a mirror. I see now how anxiety and self-doubt made me question my worthiness. I see how I sometimes got defensive, which stems from old wounds. I also see how financial strain affected my ability to contribute or plan, even when my intentions were good. She was patient, and I’m learning from it all. I’ve started substitute teaching again and I’m now working with a Montessori training coordinator—exploring a future working with kids. Funny enough, that clarity came from watching how passionate and good she was at her job. I still hurt deeply. This is the kind of love that lingers in your chest long after it’s over. But I’ve talked to friends, cried, reflected, and kept going. I don’t regret anything. I just want to use this as fuel to become the person I know I can be. I wanted to write this not to dwell—but to honor it. To immortalize something that meant a lot. If you’ve ever been through something similar—if you’ve ever felt like you lost someone because you weren’t quite ready, but later found yourself, and found love again—I’d love to hear from you. Because I want to believe that’s possible. And I want to thank her—for everything. Thank you, R. ❤️ started to love her as I let myself love parts of her that scared me at first because of my anxiety and OCD, I was treated very well. She taught me so much about cooking, regulating emotions and so on. I really do love her still but basically a week ago, we broke due to her very busy job working with children one of whom is sick with a disease. I believe she realized where we are in different stages in life. She knows a lot about my trauma and the fact that I can’t emotionally rely on my dad, despite my dad helping me pay rent (I know I’m working on that) but I’ll stay overtime my OCD anxiety low pay for a part-time job that cut my hours and an overall not knowing what I wanna do with my life despite making a lot of growth through therapy and organizing things more. I think she slowly started to realize I’m in a different place and still figuring my stuff out. With that being said, I have grown a lot this year since my mom died in 2024 and she really helped me grow a lot. She has always been my biggest supporter and biggest cheerleader and even during our break up where we are both crying she said how proud she was of me, but because of the stress of her life, it was too much to take on. Now, obviously, I’m very much grieving this and wishing we could’ve worked things out. I’m not mad at her and she was in no way being unreasonable at the end of the day I want what’s best for her we are doing no contact for 30 days before I give her back her things and we might get coffee for one last meeting, though we both volunteer for the same organization. I’m not going to get back with her and I don’t wanna make this some sort of weird false mission. I think, even though she was very supportive on my mental health, I realize ways that I had self sabotage through anxiety and doubting my worthiness to be with her. On top of this, there were many times that I had trouble preparing things due to financial restraints because of the affirmation job. These were all clearly communicated in times I would get defensive and I’m realizing that this defense in this comes from childhood trauma. Other points of contention in our relationship is the fact that me and my three other roommates seem to be on different stages of life and where I’m trying to make improvement immature and they are still very much in the same mid 20s starving artist vibe so I’m thinking eventually when I get my own apartment or a small apartment with a different friend. I am currently getting back into substitute teaching and I’m able to get Monday through Friday jobs and have been in contact with the local Montessori teacher training coordinator as I think this would be a good goal for me as I like working with kids. I’ll say a lot of what I realized I wanted to do is because of what I’ve seen her do in regards to working with children. Even though right now I’m very heartbroken. I have been able to talk to so many friends about what happened and I wish we could’ve worked things out, but I think I’ll always truly be grateful for this experience honestly in a way me writing this post is kind of wanting to be immortalize What I had with her but also to seek out and see how I can get better after this break up and if anyone has had similar experiences. Would love to hear if anyone else ever feels like they may have ruined a relationship with someone special, but they got their life together and even though they did not end up with that original person were able to find someone after they had became the person that they were meant to be. I am very much I’m hurting over the fact that I won’t get to spend the rest of my life with her which I know sounds crazy, but I’ve never felt this way about someone and I know I will again with someone else. It is very hard because I still do very much love this person and I think a part of me always will even typing this out now is hard. But I wanna turn this experience in an excuse to get my life together. Thank you R, for everything ❤️ how can I be better and overcome this pain?",1,1759073913.0,Healthygamergg,2,1.0,False

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

Unfortunately for me, she still has panty of ideas. And I can see that now. It's sunder afternoon (now) I worked night shit and came home at 5am. I worked since 7pm day before. I thought that I will have peace for just one day between lawyers (they don't work on Sundays here🥳) and managing everything else. Kids are doing great at school. We did had to make some adjustments to some of there subjects like native language and English, but they are doing great. They even asked for Hungarian classes, because they found my old student book (small thin book where my teacher wrote all my grades since first till fourth grade) and saw I was taking Hungarian classes as a kid. 
Let's go back to last night... I came home from urgent care where I work as a nurse until I sort out my medical degree as a doctor (I finish medical highschool and I have nursing diploma from that school). A odd person was in front of my apartment waiting. I tried ignoring him, but he stoped me and told me ""you have been served"". I was shocked because I didn't think a man from Amarica (accent) would be serving me papers. I came inside and sat at couch and started reading. I was modified. MIL was suing for aliation from family and for visits at US. I called my husband who, turns out, had blocked me. After several hours of coffee and researching how to appear at court house, but not to be flagged down by ICE. I had no one to call. My mom was sleeping, lawyers don't work today. Lawyers in US weren't from help because of time difference. 
I went along with my day until few hours ago. I got served via email again. This time it was divorce. I did filed first but papers didn't get trough yet. Hubby wanted full custody with me having supervised visitation one a year. His reasoning for custody arrangement was that I cant come more often because it's long trip and he doesn't want kids to ""see me all tired"". I am in lost what to do now..I do have proof of adultery from few years ago, but I don't think I will work.",2,1759073860.0,motherinlawsfromhell,0,1.0,False
1nsrefw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTactics/comments/1nsrefw/reveal_if_the_best_wireless_headphone_generic_bd1/,Reveal if the best wireless headphone Generic BD-1 lives up to the hype,"Trying out the Generic BD-1 wireless headphones for daily use has been an enlightening experience. As someone who’s constantly on the lookout for a balance between sound quality, comfort, and portability, I put these headphones to the test in various scenarios—whether commuting, working from my home office, or zoning out to music while tackling weekend chores. 

**Comfort and Design**  
The lightweight build of the headphones quickly caught my attention. At only 6.1 ounces, they feel barely noticeable on the head, and the adjustable headband makes them versatile enough to fit a variety of head sizes comfortably. I wore them for hours without any fatigue thanks to the memory protein ear cups. My niece borrowed them for a long study session, and she mentioned the same thing—they didn’t get uncomfortably warm or tight after extended use. What’s also convenient is the foldable design, which allowed me to toss them into my bag without taking up too much space. However, the plastic material gives a somewhat less durable impression. While it hasn’t shown any signs of wear yet, there’s still a slight concern over how it might hold up in the long run.  

**Seamless Connectivity**  
Connecting to the headphones was ridiculously easy. With the Bluetooth 5.3 technology, pairing them to my phone took just a few seconds. The range held up well, too. I could leave my phone in my bedroom and roam around my apartment freely without the signal dropping, which I found crucial during my home workout sessions. The inclusion of a 3.5mm jack is also a win, offering a wired mode for those times when you forget to charge the battery. Honestly, this feature came in clutch once when I was running late for a meeting and couldn’t wait for a quick recharge. 

[Check Generic BD-1 price on Amazon.](https://metaversegenome.com/p/b0f12mgtc7/)

**Performance and Sound Quality**  
The sound quality exceeded what I expected at this price point. Thanks to the dynamic drivers, the audio had a balanced clarity across highs, mids, and lows. While I wouldn’t label it audiophile-grade, the overall experience was immersive enough for everyday listening. The active noise cancellation (ANC), on the other hand, was decent but not groundbreaking. It effectively reduced lower to mid-frequency noises, like the hum of my home heater or noise from a fan, but struggled in loudly chaotic environments like a bustling coffee shop. 

The built-in microphone turned out to be surprisingly reliable. I tested it during Zoom calls, and my coworkers noted how clear my voice sounded without background interference. While on a quick call outdoors, it managed fairly well, though it didn’t always completely block out heavy wind or traffic noise.

**Battery Life and Charging**  
With 24 hours of playtime on a full charge and a charging duration of just 1.5 hours, these headphones fit effortlessly into my routine. I used them for nearly a full week of intermittent music and podcast marathons before the need to plug them back in. Plus, the dual-mode capability meant I could switch to wired use as a backup, which proved handy when I forgot to charge them overnight.

**Perks**  
• Ultra-lightweight and portable design  
• Excellent Bluetooth range without drops  
• Dual-mode flexibility for wireless and wired listening  
• Comfort-focused memory foam ear cups  
• Microphone clarity that's above average for calls  

**Caveats**  
• Plastic build feels less premium and possibly prone to wear over time  
• Noise cancellation struggles in noisy, urban environments  
• Sound quality, while solid, won’t satisfy demanding audiophiles  

**Product Comparisons**  
I recently had the opportunity to compare these headphones to a pair of Sony WH-CH710N over-ear headphones that a friend owns. While the Sony model had slightly better active noise cancellation and a more premium feel, the price jump was significant. On sound quality alone, the Generic BD-1 holds its own, especially when factoring in dual-mode flexibility. Another alternative I’ve tested is the JBL Tune 510BT, which offers an equally compact design but without a wired mode—a dealbreaker for me personally. Durability-wise, the JBL felt sturdier, but it couldn’t match the comfort of the memory foam cups on this product.

**Cost-Efficiency**  
Given the feature set this model offers—like the lightweight feel, long battery life, and acceptable noise cancellation—it’s hard to argue against its appeal in terms of price performance. It competes with higher-priced options while still including staples like dual-mode usability and fast charging. If you’re willing to hedge your bets on the plastic build, these headphones provide tremendous value. Budget-conscious users who want reliability for walking, casual travel, or even remote work will be especially happy.

1nsrdc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1nsrdc4/we_eat_their_young/,We Eat Their Young!,"In the past, women didn’t enjoy the freedoms we do now. They weren’t allowed to vote, own a bank account, or have multiple sexual partners. Humanity imposed a strict, unyielding grip on every woman.

Women were raised to be married off, their sole function to start a family. From infancy, they were groomed for this purpose, and failure branded them as inadequate.

Thus, women grew up learning what men wanted to succeed in the vital task the patriarchy deemed their true purpose.

But with time, that changed, as did women’s perception of themselves. They broke free from patriarchal shackles. Now, as I walked the hull of the Ageron Ship, my long stilettos clanking upon the odd wooden-like floors, I felt not just freedom but the weight of an entire planet fueling my drive, the expectations of my race anchoring my resolve.

A woman had been appointed by Earth to speak for all: men, women, and children alike. I was the first human the Ageron would meet. Sure — Matt Lambert, my aide, walked behind me, but I would enter the presence of the Ageron first. I would chart the course of our conversation. Through me, the Ageron would know humanity: they would appreciate our disposition and grasp our core values, for I embodied all that was right with humanity.

“Jessica, you’re walking too fast,” Matt whispered. I slowed my pace but stayed a few strides ahead. “Aren’t you afraid of the aliens?” he asked, gesturing at our surroundings.

I turned to stare at him; he’d been trying to grow a beard to hide his weak chin, but now he just looked like a man with a weak beard and chin. It was said he grew up a farmhand of little intelligence. His father discovered a deposit of some precious ore while attempting to dig to China to prove a point to his beer-drinking buddies, a find that made his family wealthy. The Collective Government struck a friendship with his father because of this, securing his son’s employment who was now at my side. Away from the farm where he had been meant to dwell for the entirety of his life. 

Regardless of how hard one worked, there was always another near your position who attained that position through unconventional means. I did not like Matt; he was an idiot and, beyond that, represented the patriarchal structure whose grip refused to release humanity. Our shame followed us into the future, spurred by the need to control and ignorant of its own flaws.

“You’re looking at me like that again,” Matt said, turning his face to the ground as his long strides struggled to match my hurried short ones.

“Like what?” I dared him to speak his mind. Was he even capable of such a thing?

“Like I’m a turd stuck to the bottom of your shoe,” he said.

“My stilettos are Prada, such shoes don’t tread on shit,” I replied.

“Aren’t you anxious?” Matt asked. “This is your first time meeting an alien too, isn’t it?” He peered about. There was a light, shaped like a strange arrow with a circular tip instead of a sharp point. It marked the walls of the hull, guiding us along the path deeper into the Ageron ship. We’d docked on the large, ominous ship just moments ago, and in my eagerness to meet the Ageron, I’d paid little attention to their technology’s complexities. Why care about the tool in the presence of its maker? I wanted to see the Ageron, to know them as they sought to know us.

We were one year from Earth, using a wormhole tangent practically unknown to us. The Ageron sent a third-party race, which contacted the shuttle station outside Earth through a unique form of electro-current communication, to inform us that the Ageron wished to invest in sentient life in this corner of the universe. An honor unlike any other.

Through a thoroughly analyzed transmission, we deduced who the Ageron were, but we had no clue about their appearance. There were rumors of them here and there across the galaxy, from the few First Contact instances we’d encountered with alien races that were primitive and frightful.

The Ageron decided the course of nature; they could take a barren planet like Mars and make it flourish with vegetation and endless water.

They also had the technology to collapse an entire star system. In short, the Ageron were powerful, anonymous, and truly worthy of not just our respect but utmost subservience.

The third-party alien race, which only communicated with the space shuttle, gave us a glimpse into the Ageron’s workings. The Ageron knew nothing about the planets they contacted; they only sought sentience, set up a first meeting, and learned about the planet and its inhabitants from that meeting. Afterward, they decided whether we were worthy of partnership. If not, rumors suggested they might eradicate a planet posing a threat to galactic sentience. This I’d pondered greatly, and through extensive research, I created a detailed assessment of Earth, its sentient inhabitants, and our honest relationship with other species.

Out of a hundred million men and women, I was chosen to handle this first meeting because of my work which entailed step-by-step measures highlighting our positive attributes, especially those agricultural in nature, reflecting our attempts to master our surroundings. With the Ageron’s help, and preferably their knowledge, we could leap forward in our evolution and create a utopia not just on Earth but all the way to Uranus.

And with me was Matt, my assistant at my government job, riding on my success as a former farmhand who knew how to be useful. He was invaluable for fetching coffee and legwork. The smart thinking, he left to me; he was the perfect assistant who wouldn’t eclipse his boss’s light. When this meeting was documented, my name would stand out: Jessica Jane, ambassador for Earth.

“You aren’t nervous?” Matt asked as we approached large double doors that seemed crafted from meteor ore. As we neared, the doors opened on their own. We had not seen a single inhabitant of the ship; we believed the third-party race, which contacted the space shuttle, were not creatures of flesh and bone but forged of something else — perhaps electromagnetic or spectrum-based. That’s why they were unable to permeate Earth’s atmospheric cover to transmit their message directly to Earth. In short, we had seen no alien and had no idea what the Ageron looked like.

I stopped and turned to Matt. “You think my ancestors — peasant women who toiled in the fields all day with toddlers strapped to their bodies — showed fear in times of war when men rode on horses to plunder their lives and bodies? I fear nothing.”

“But—”

“But nothing, Matt. Your job is simple. You shut up and leave the talking to me. I am better equipped for this than you are.” I offered him a teasing smile and watched as his cheeks colored; men are so easily swayed by their urges. “I have an extensive portfolio and an even more extensive data collection regarding Earth.” I waved the drive I held tightly in my hand. “We are guaranteed success.”

And with that, my stilettos clanking on the hull floor, I made my way past the double doors. Not caring if Matt could keep up, I was in my element. Nothing could sway my resolve.

----

The rest of the ship had been dark, but this room seemed to have an artificial sun on the ceiling that cast heat and light. The floors were green and soft, like grass. A gentle breeze brushed my face as I took it all in. The walls appeared to mimic a sky, blue and white with clouds that moved across the room. A single occupant stood in the middle, facing us.

It had a broad, muscular body, yet softened by a calm, lumbering presence. Its skin was patterned in a brown-and-white patchwork that formed an irregular mosaic across its body.

Its head was wide and strong, with large, gentle eyes that held a dark, liquid softness, fringed by long lashes that gave an almost thoughtful expression. Two ears flicked, sitting beneath a pair of short, curved horns. Its muzzle appeared moist and cool, ending in a broad pink nose.

“Betsy?” Matt wondered aloud.

I just gawked at the creature. Then I turned my head around the room, in every direction. There was no other living entity within the room. Just us humans and the . . . the—

The Cow.

Her body sloped into a wide ribcage and strong legs with tough cloven hooves. I could tell she was female because, along her underside, was the udder: a swollen, fleshy organ with four teats, the source of milk that made cows central to agriculture. A long, whip-like tail ended in a tuft of coarse hair, useful for swatting away insects according to the detailed agricultural data on livestock use on the drive I held.

The Cow stared at us for a long moment.

“Jessica—” Matt started.

“I see it, Matt. I fucking see it,” I whispered.

The cow moved forward, and as its hooves met the ground, faint symbols sprouted around the point of impact. The symbols rose and engulfed the cow, appearing as dark tattoos swirling upon her hide. The tattoos then settled on her throat, making it appear as if she wore a black choker.

“Hello,” the Cow said.

Matt screamed and fell backward. The cow rolled her eyes and tapped the ground twice. From where Matt sat panting on the ground, eyes wide with shock, a circular spot of the floor parted, and a transparent container of water rose from the ground.

The cow nodded toward the drink. “Please, drink, it has a calming pheromone. I understand first encounters can be rough, but I promise you, there is nothing you ought to be afraid of. I mean you no harm.” The cow’s head turned to me.

The Cow . . . The Ageron . . . The Ageron were cows. Realization forced my eyes open just as wide as Matt’s were. My hands trembled, and a thin sheen of sweat covered my face.

Matt took a drink of the water in the glass, something I should have advised him against. I had no idea what would happen to him, but he seemed to calm as he downed the drink. I felt like asking for one myself until he opened his mouth to speak. “Betsy, I’m so sorry, they told me you’d been set free. I was a child back then. I never thought you were the ribs we ate that night during Thanksgiving—” I kicked Matt hard in the balls. He had it coming, sitting there on the ground with his legs wide open.

He groaned, gripped his groin, and thankfully shut up. I turned my attention to the cow, the Ageron, who eyed me with mild amusement.

“I also do that to my mate when he annoys me,” she said and smiled — a cow’s smile. I felt like crying for some reason, and I oddly craved a steak.

“Hello, my name is Jessica, I’m a human from Earth. I take it you’re the Ageron?” I asked. Business as usual. This was a minor setback, minor . . . minor . . . minor. I just had to focus, and I’d untangle it.

The cow nodded with satisfaction. “Yes, I’m an Ageron, in my home world, they call me Moora. But you can call me Moo.”

I gawked at her. This had to be a fucking joke.

The drink must have done something to Matt, for he was acting without inhibitions. He stood up off the ground, rubbing at his bruised groin and not giving me any mind. He turned to Moo and spoke. “I cried, you know, all through the night when Pa told me the greasy stew I licked off my fingers was courtesy of you. I decided then to become a vegetarian, though I lapsed back into old habits at a barbecue. I mean, they didn’t have vegan burgers, and the smell of the roast was so good, and I was a little drunk and . . . Betsy, I’m sorry. I should have fought for you, run away with you as we talked about, ventured into the open fields to eat grass to our fill. Remember? I used to see you eat it, and I’d eat it too until I got a stomachache. Sometimes I think that’s why Pa did it . . .” A sob escaped him. “Because I was eating grass; we were too close, he always said.” Tears cascaded down his cheeks.

“It appears the calming effect of the drink has become a little too calming, do you mistake me for someone else?” Moo asked while tilting her head at us. “Are there Ageron on your planet?”

My eyes shifted to the choker-like technology around her neck. Danger! Alarm bells sounded in my mind. The Agerons’ technology could collapse stars. She was using that device to communicate in our tongue. Such technology was unprecedented. What more could they do?

A chill ran down my spine. We’d decided not to carry weaponry, for what good would a gun do against a race that could collapse stars?

“Pardon me, Moo,” I said, wrapping my hand around Matt’s arm. “My partner here needs a moment to become acclimated to the presence of an Ageron. Can we have a moment in private to converse outside this chamber so that I may calm him down?”

Moo turned her gaze from Matt to me, then she spoke. “I will bring you to a place of privacy; even I shall not hear what you speak of. Once done with your calming ritual, tap the ground with your strange feet, and I will know to bring you back. Two taps, okay?” I nodded. Moo raised a hoof and brought it down twice. Suddenly, we were engulfed in darkness that quickly receded to reveal a pristinely crafted room. Everything was forged of gold with two plush seats large enough to accommodate a . . . cow.

We were alone. There were no doors or windows, which spelled just how much power the Agerons had over us. I hastily grabbed Matt and took him to the couch. I slapped him hard across the face to get his attention as he blinked and peered about. I slapped him again because it felt great the first time.

“Listen, Matt, that is not Betsy, okay? It’s not your childhood—” I waved my hands about his face. “Pet! It’s not a pet, okay?”

“But her hide . . . it’s the same pattern,” Matt started.

“Cows look alike, Matt! It’s not your childhood pet. It’s a very dangerous alien. Separate thoughts of livestock from your mind and stop talking about eating ribs or barbecue; stop that stupid nonsense, or you’ll get us killed!” I grabbed either side of his face, aligning it with my own. “We are in danger here, Matt. I can’t give her the drive with information about Earth. It contains every agricultural venture we’ve undertaken, including our use of livestock.”

His eyes widened.

“Yes, Matt, slaughter, castration, continuous impregnation for a steady flow of milk, dehorning, tail docking, branding without anesthesia. We are the most putrid and wretched alien species to the Agerons. If they know we have cows on Earth, docile and unintelligent that we treat as we do, they might just kill us all on that dust bowl of a fucking planet, and you know who’ll die first? You and me, Matt. They might take us and do to us what we’ve done to them. Do you want to be castrated? Do I look like I want to be milked?”

By the look on Matt’s pale face, I could tell he was now fully aware of what was at stake. He opened his mouth, and I heard the fright creep back into his voice as the altered water’s effect wore off.

“Oh no,” he said. “Oh God, oh no!” It sounded more than remorse, like he knew something else. “She’s a mother, Moo is a mother, I can tell, Jessica, I always know when a co— I can tell when they have young . . .”

I cocked my head at him.

“We separate calves from their mothers, Jessica, for veal, calf meat. We eat their young!”

I immediately turned my head around the room, looking for the faint symbols that had coalesced as a black collar around the Agerons. There was nothing; everything was gold, but who knew what their technology entailed? The gold itself could be a listening device.

What would the Ageron do if she knew what we humans did to those who resembled them? Would she ignore it, claiming the cows of Earth were unrelated to them? Was it possible to do so when similarities ruled every physical trait between the two? The cows of Earth looked exactly like the Ageron we’d met.

With a trembling hand, I wiped sweat from my brow. The room was far from hot or humid; the sweat was the body’s way of portraying the battles within.

I am a woman, chosen among my kind to represent us before the Agerons and initiate first contact. Women have suffered for millennia, men too, don’t get me wrong, but even in the Bible we quote, we are said to be cursed to live under men. But here I am, in a role many women before me fought to prove themselves worthy of playing.

Yet, for the first time since news of the Agerons reached Earth, since the thought of standing before them to represent my kind first coalesced in my mind, I deeply regretted being where I was. It would be better if someone else were here; I didn’t care about gender, accolades, recognition, or becoming a feminist icon. I did not want to be on this fucking ship. I pulled strands of my hair, eyes wide and frantic.

I ate beef all the time; seasoned veal was my favorite, especially when spiced with dark pepper and a little too much salt, cooked medium with a side of guacamole and Italian sauce. I remembered picking out the calf for slaughter at a fancy restaurant where I could meet my meal before it was cooked for me to eat.

“Jessica,” Matt said, thankfully drawing my mind from the situation. “I think we can wiggle out of this.”

I turned to this man. He always claimed I was intelligent, but I thought he used words to flatter me, hoping I’d see him in a new light or return the compliment. I tended not to lie to myself. I can lie to anyone but not to myself. I did not find him intelligent or worthy of the compliment. 

“I have no idea what to do,” I said. “I don’t know what the Agerons want to learn about Earth, but I feel I’m playing Russian roulette with my entire planet and everyone on it. I just . . .”

To my surprise, Matt stepped in close and placed both his hands on my shoulders, large, calloused hands that knew bruising. “When I lost Betsy, I changed. I valued all life, sure, barbecues were a weakness, but I made an effort to learn about societies in general and how we treat animals, I think—”

I shook him off. The damn fool was still hung up on his damn childhood pet. “Leave this to me, Matt, I have no idea how to go about this, but I’m sure whatever I can come up with is better than what you have to offer. Can’t have you talking about Betsy in front of her again.”

Matt moved to speak, but I squatted down and tapped the ground twice. As the room morphed and we were transported back to the Agerons, I gathered all my resolve, recalling every instance of prejudice and adversity I’d overcome to reach where I was now.

I had believed in myself through dire situations; I believed I could do the same here, despite the stakes being as vast as star systems.

----

""So,"" Moo started. We stood before her, deathly still. No doubt looking pale, Matt stole glances at me, but I ignored him. ""You see, we Agerons have a certain way of life. We value those within the galaxy who exhibit great potential for good. A certain frequency resonates from their planet, and we are able to discover it and thus find them, but our understanding is limited, so we set up these meetings to gain a better grasp of those we wish to know.""

Matt nodded, but I knew complacent acceptance would dull the conversation; we should learn as much about them as we could. ""Why don’t you visit the planets yourselves?"" I asked.

Moo nodded her head up and down, as if pleased with this question. ""The Great Mother forbids our hooves from touching ground she did not seed. Only our home world, Ageronia, is where we are permitted to breathe and tread. Even this ship is crafted of materials from my home world. The very air within this ship is of Ageronia.""

So they had a religion and followed a set of rules. This pleased me; it was good news that they could not come down to Earth to see our . . . ways firsthand.

""However, we do have a means to observe a planet directly from here, which I shall demonstrate after a few questions. Thankfully, you’ve brought a device holding your planet’s knowledge, as we’d requested, as I see you have."" She eyed me, and I remembered the drive I still held. It suddenly weighed like an anvil. ""This meeting will be relatively short; it will determine whether other meetings will come in the future."" Moo turned from me to Matt. ""Or if other things might occur.""

My heart pounded; I had no doubt that was a threat I’d heard.

""You can observe our planet directly?"" I asked, trying to force courage into my voice and falling terribly short of a squeal.

""Yes, but we require a mental image of the place from its inhabitants, which is why we seek this first meeting. Since we can’t touch down on your planet, this is the next best thing."" The Ageron observed us; she hesitated a moment before adding, ""I assure you, we mean you no harm. I feel both of you are experiencing great unease. We are not a conquest species, nor are we in need of forming a universal body like the Galactic Federation who thankfully are yet to reach out to Earth in this iteration; we exist as what you would call philanthropists with a need to socialize and aid progression."" And the Ageron smiled, lips curling gently, not in a practiced manner but naturally — a strange yet beautiful sight on a cow.

They were going to scan our minds to see a specific place on Earth. This thought screamed in my mind. The checkmate was coming across the board, but it was in the future; I would figure out a way to cross that bridge when I got there.

""Now, let me inquire a little of Earth,"" Moo said. She stomped her foot, and one wall morphed, changing from clear sky to a completely blank screen. ""What is the staple food for humans?""

""We cook some of our meals while others we eat raw,"" I started. Symbols formed as I spoke, white against black on the blank wall—a record of my words. This was a dance, like the salsa classes I took as a kid, inspired by how women moved on screen, a grace I always wanted to emulate. I just had to make sure not to step on another’s toes. ""We farm, grow plants for our nourishment, gaining carbohydrates mostly from wheat-based products and protein from legumes, beans, and the like. There is supposed to be a detailed account of our farming habits, but the drive—"" I held it out before Moo. ""I was so excited to come here and meet you, I ended up taking the wrong data drive. This one is blank, having no data. It is a grave mistake I made.""

Lie . . . Lie . . . Lie.

Moo seemed pleased for some reason. ""No wonder you are so nervous, do not worry about the drive. I am glad you gain your nourishment from the ground, as we do. Wheat is common on Ageronia, but it requires clearing land to grow; this can result in the displacement of other creatures, which is why we prefer a more natural food production means over farming. Just allowing nature to be for the Great Mother has never let us down.""

Moo nodded again. ""It seems I have nothing to worry about, I admit I was a bit skeptical when I first met the two of you . . ."" I was about to ask why, but she barreled on. ""Because of your teeth; their shape is somewhat familiar to a race we abhor and played a role in their extinction, for their existence caused pain to other species. The sharp points speak of a diet that is . . . well, you do eat plant-based life, is this so?"" She turned to Matt. ""What is your favorite thing to eat?""

The question was directed at Matt. She probably took his silence either as a challenge or a weakness, something she could exploit to some advantage.

""I love chocolate,"" Matt said. I fought the urge to slap my forehead, strip off my clothing, and run out of there screaming like a madwoman. A dairy product, of all the things he could have mentioned — from bananas to cabbages, all he could think of was chocolate?

""Oh, I do not know what that is, is it a particular substance, or is it something made from a combination? I understand some races mix ingredients for utmost flavor.""

Matt darted his eyes toward me, and I swooped in for the rescue. ""Chocolate is a mixture of cocoa, sugar, and a liquid extracted from . . . almonds is added to it. It’s a complex process we are not well versed in.""

Moo nodded again. ""I have to say, I am pleased with this, but I feel as though there is much that you are reluctant to share. Is there something particularly vicious about Earth that you’re hoping doesn’t come to light here?""

""Yes,"" I said. ""We are among many species; some dwell in the air, others in water, and many on land.""

Matt could not hide his audible gasp, but I pushed on. I sensed something, like a hound sniffing a hare. I shouldn’t have used such an analogy at that moment.

""It is as well on Ageronia,"" Moo said. ""These species that are beneath you, do you treat them well?""

""Yes, we have dogs and cats whom we adopt into our homes and raise as if they were our own. We have physicians who venture into the habitats of other creatures to heal their sick. We try to build a harmonious society as best we can.""

Moo smiled again. ""Do not worry, with the technology at our disposal, we will ensure disease is something Earth never has to worry about. To be honest, I wasn’t fully truthful with you. The main reason we hold these meetings is to learn exactly how a sentient species treats those who are beneath them. But from what I’ve learned thus far, you humans are a good sort. The kind we have been looking for.""

My heart broke but then mended itself, racing with her next words. ""Now, since you have participated little,"" Moo turned to Matt, ""it is you whose mind we shall use so I may get a glimpse of Earth, see the life of a particular place and how the life there thrives. Now stand still.""

Moo tapped the ground several times with her front hoof. The faint symbols coalesced around Matt, coming atop his head. He stood completely still, his eyes on me. The symbols wrapped around his head and formed a black crown that pulsed, and suddenly the whole room changed hue to a brilliant purple-pink color.

""Now, human, kindly picture a location on Earth, and it shall display around this chamber from your memory. I will be able to see firsthand the state of humans and deduce for myself the next course of action,"" Moo said. ""It will be best if you’ve been to that place frequently.""

This was it. The first things she would see was Matt eating at a beefsteak or herding cattle or slaughtering them since he had been a farmhand. Moo would see him branding a bull or something, and she would end up branding me. Then she would take Matt and me and make us serve as an example, send us back as smoked meat or something.

I was struggling so hard not to tremble. I clutched my hands, my eyes fixed on Matt. I wished it were me with that thing on my head; I could handle it . . . I think.

""I just picture a place I’ve been?"" Matt asked.

""Yes,"" Moo answered. ""The room will morph, and I will see the place or the event your mind feeds the Selistianaria crown.""

""Okay,"" Matt said. He closed his eyes, took in a deep breath, and exhaled.

The room morphed as Moo had said. One minute we were standing in a magenta room; the next, we were on a dust-riddled street, with throngs of people suddenly appearing, roaming about. Music blared, a soft thrum with joyful singing. The people were all dancing in colorful clothes, smiles lighting up their faces. I could tell from their appearance that they were . . .

""India, a state called Rajasthan. During the festival of Gopashtami,"" Matt said. ""I make it a habit to attend at least once every decade or so because of Bets— because I love it.""

""What is Gopash—"" Moo started, but her words died in her mouth. The images kept morphing, switching, like a video that turned into a picture of something else, then another video somewhat different from the last yet still of the same thing. Around the chamber, cows and people filled our point of view.

Moo, for the first time, moved beyond stomping her hooves on the ground. She made a light jog around the room, as hyper-realistic images swayed in and out of focus. She turned her head about, eyes wide with wonder. We watched as the Indians bathed the cows, painted their horns, and wrapped them in shiny cloth; the cows were also adorned with garlands of marigold and bells around their necks.

""Gopashtami is the festival of the Cow, which is our name for the species of Agerons that dwell on Earth. They are unlike you in that they lack sentience,"" Matt said. Moo turned her head back and forth, observing as throngs of people gathered to touch the cows’ hooves as a mark of reverence. Priests and elders performed and waved lamps before the cows, as one would for a deity. They offered flowers, incense, sweets, and water.

""But despite not being of similar intelligence to you Agerons or us humans, we perform 'gua mata', our name for Mother Cow, whom we believe brings blessings, prosperity, and forgiveness of sins,"" Matt said.

""Great Mother!"" Moo gasped. ""Your reach is far indeed!""

I kept my eyes on Matt. Somehow, this man had done something no man had ever done before. He had surprised me, in a way he had always surprised me, come to think of it, from how he endured my bitterness, my sharp retorts, and cruel nature without complaint, steadfastly enduring. And now, here, he had proven himself more than useful — he was valuable beyond a doubt. God! I was seeing him in a new light.

Moo stomped her leg, and my attention shifted to her. All the images around the room collapsed except one, which she neared. It was a bunch of children, toddlers in fact, standing before a cow, holding grass and sweets, large smiles on their faces as they raised their tiny, pudgy hands with the goods toward the cow’s maw, which gladly accepted them. Moo leaned close to the holographic depiction, eyes sparkling before I realized she was crying. Matt and I stood in silence as the Ageron observed her distant cousin being fed by human children.

""The Selistianaria crown does not lie,"" Moo said after a long moment, tears streaming down her face as she turned to Matt. ""This is Earth? You treat us — those who are like us . . . like this?""

Matt moved to speak, but the words died in his throat. I chimed in quickly. One of us had to carry the cross, might as well be me.

""Yes,"" I said. ""That is humanity for you.""

""I am amazed and pleased,"" Moo said. ""You do not know how many species treat those who are . . ."" She sighed — an odd sound coming from her. ""I have much to send back to Ageronia. I ask that you return to your people. Make a list of everything you need for any purpose at all, and when we meet next, we Agerons will provide whatever you need for the next millennia until you are equal to us in advancement. This I vow on behalf of all Agerons, for you have pleased us above all other species.""

The words rang in my mind. Suddenly, the implication of what was being offered hit me like a hurricane. Here, in this chamber, I had orchestrated something far worse than anyone who’d ever eaten or slaughtered a cow — a wretched deceit without end to its depth, based on one ritual only one community on Earth practiced.

I moved to speak, to confess, to call us frauds. The guilt and the shame were too much. I didn’t want to lie anymore, not like this. I wanted the thing on my head so she could see what we were. But to my surprise, Matt made a hurried stride and held my hand. It was such an odd gesture; he knew I didn’t take kindly to physical contact, but it shut me up.

""We are grateful,"" Matt said. ""We shall depart with this news.""

The Ageron nodded. ""And I ask, the next time we meet, please bring me one, if not two, of the Agerons of Earth . . . the . . . umm . . . cows?""

Matt nodded. I just stood, as if watching everything play out in a dream, unable to alter things further than I had already done.

Next thing I knew, Matt was ushering me out of the chamber, back to our ship where we would return to Earth. I passed down the hull, Matt holding me by the shoulder. He wiped my face, and only then did I realize I had been weeping.

""We are monsters!"" I declared.

""Some of us are, yes, but not all of us,"" Matt said.

""We are not worthy of their technology.""

""Neither are we worthy of their wrath.""

""What have I done?""

""Whatever we needed to do to get out of there alive,"" Matt said. ""You didn’t know the power of that thing she put on my head; every image I thought of appeared in that room. I had to focus everything on that one specific image of the times I visited India.""

""I’m a horrible person, Matt,"" I sobbed.

""I have a feeling many will feel the same when they learn of our meeting with the Agerons,"" he said, and for some reason, that helped a little.

1nsrd4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nsrd4a/what_kind_of_man_would_i_be/,What Kind Of Man Would I Be,"There was a wall on the east side of the city, tucked behind a shuttered jazz club and a bakery that only opened on Sundays. It wasn’t famous, not tagged with murals or declarations of love. Just a slab of concrete, weathered and cracked, where people wrote things they couldn’t say out loud.

That’s where they went.

Nia and Devin met in college—two firestorms wrapped in soft skin. They loved like they were building something eternal, but somewhere between the job offers, the miscarriages, the silences, and the nights spent facing opposite walls, they lost the map.

They didn’t break up in a blaze. No screaming, no betrayal. Just a quiet agreement: We’re not good for each other anymore.

But the love didn’t die. It just got buried under the rubble of unmet needs and unspoken apologies. They both moved on and got married. Both married to loving supportive spouses that trusted them. 

---

Year One

They saw each other at a mutual friend’s birthday. She wore the scarf he gave her three winters ago. He brought her favorite wine, pretending it was for the host.

They talked. Laughed. Walked to the wall together.

She pulled out a piece of chalk from her purse. He raised an eyebrow.

“One hash mark,” she said. “For not crossing the line.”

He nodded. “For not pretending we’re still us.”

She drew it. A single white line.

---

Year Three

They met for coffee. Just coffee.

She had someone now. So did he.

But when she leaned in to hug him goodbye, her breath lingered on his neck. His hand stayed on her back a second too long.

They didn’t kiss. Didn’t confess.

Later that night, he drove to the wall. Drew the third mark.

---

Year Five

They cuddled once.

It was raining. Her car broke down. He picked her up. They sat in his apartment, soaked and shivering.

She curled into him like she used to. He held her like he never stopped.

But when her lips brushed his collarbone, he whispered, “Don’t.”

She pulled away. “I know.”

They didn’t sleep together. Didn’t stay the night.

She went to the wall the next morning. Drew the fifth line.

Year Seven

They stopped meeting.

Not out of anger. Just out of mercy.

They knew the ache would never leave. That some loves don’t fade—they just get folded into the architecture of who you are.

But they also knew the kind of people they wanted to be.

Not the kind who stole moments from other lives. Not the kind who made excuses for old flames.

So they let go.

---

Year Ten

She beat him to the wall.

He arrived minutes later, saw the tenth mark already there.

He smiled. Touched the line with his fingertips.

She had written something beneath it this time:

Still love you. Just not like that because I can’t.

He added his own:

Still love you. Always like that. But I won’t.

They never saw each other again.

But every year, one of them returned.

And the wall kept growing.

A monument to restraint. To memory.

To the kind of love that doesn’t ask for more.

Just asks to be remembered.

1. Do I need to use that for #2?

everyone a prisoner of flight delay's embrace.  



The concept of time has no meaning in here--  
that's why some souls are sipping their 7 a.m. beer.  



Drop off your luggage and find the next café,    
order a morning pizza, today is not every day.  



Don't forget the mandatory iced coffee,    
full of sugar or drizzled with liquid toffee.  



Don't be a hero and choose it without the sweet,    
otherwise I'm yelling: *are you admitting defeat?!*  



Iced sludge from McDonald's making me gag,    
or it's just a dirty potion anticipating the jet lag.



I chug the mixture down to take my own revenge--  
on myself, because whom else would I avenge?  



Just another airport, another sad caffeine drink.   
I'm not American, what's with the iced coffee kink?  



When will I finally learn this shit is a toxic soup?    
Maybe next time I'll go for the ice cream scoop.  



Did I just hear my flight number's final call?    
Wrong gate, another sip, another endless hall.

1nsr9mn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsr9mn,Strange Geometry - Announcement!!,"Hello all! I wanted to stop in today and announcement that my fiction ""Strange Geometry"" is going through some changes!

First of all, I have a new cover. It was time to retire the other one, and I think this new one turned out really great.

Secondly, I have announced in an update chapter that I am writing a continuation called ""Quiet Magic"". I've attached the cover for that as well.

Thirdly, Since I've decided to continue the series in this manner, I've branded the duology ""Interwoven"".

Launch date for ""Quiet Magic"" is still TBD, so now is a great time to jump in, get caught up, and drop a follow, fav, and review! It would mean the world to me!

Link: [Strange Geometry: Interwoven Book 1 | Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/125456/strange-geometry-interwoven-book-1)

Synopsis:

Meet Ariel: a quiet plus-sized woman living by routine who finds her world upended when she crosses paths with the radiant, chaotic, and impossibly kind Holly. What begins as chance meetings over coffee slowly deepens into a story about connection, vulnerability, and the unexpected shapes love can take. Yet beneath the laughter and warmth lies the truth that love is also tested: by fire, by memory, and by the shadows we carry. Strange Geometry is a contemporary romance that celebrates tenderness and resilience, showing how even in the face of tragedy, love can reshape the world.

What to Expect:

\- A romance full of tenderness and charm

\- Cozy Seattle settings: coffee shops, bookstores, and quiet walks

\- Themes of healing, memory, and belonging

\- Playful banter balanced with heartfelt emotion

\- Trauma and tragedy woven into a story of resilience

\- Strong focus on character growth and relationships

\- A love story that embraces both joy and pain",6,1759073469.0,royalroad,2,0.8,False

1nsr83l,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alarming_Floor9963/comments/1nsr83l/what_to_do_if_you_have_retroactive_jealousy/,What to Do If You Have Retroactive Jealousy?,"Does anyone else wake up with their chest feeling tight, like someone’s squeezing it, just ‘cause your brain won’t stop fixating on your partner’s past? That was me, every single morning for months.

I’d lie there, staring at the ceiling, and bam—anger hits first, then this heavy sadness that makes my eyes burn. I’d wipe tears fast before my partner woke up ‘cause I was scared to say anything. Every time I did try to talk about it? We’d fight. Not yelling, just that quiet, awful arguing where no one feels heard. And the worse part? The more I loved them, the more it hurt. I’d catch myself thinking, Why did I have to find out about this? I’d give anything to unknow.

It spiraled. Their ex’s name felt like it was stuck in my head—heard a song they used to like on the radio? Instant panic. Saw a photo from a trip they took together? I’d zone out for an hour, overthinking why wasn’t I there? I’d see couples gush about being each other’s firsts and just… sink. Not even mad at them, just sad. Like, why can’t that be us? Is it weird that I want that?

I tried the “just let it go” thing a million times. Told myself, “It’s the past, it doesn’t matter.” Worked for maybe 20 minutes. Then I’d see something silly—like a coffee shop they used to go to—and I’d be right back to square one. I started pulling away, acting cold for no reason. Snapped at them once ‘cause they mentioned a old friend (who wasn’t even the ex!) and I felt terrible after. We were both so tired of it.

On top of that, I was stuck on all the stuff I’d seen online—takes about what “good” relationships “should” look like, comments that made me feel like my feelings were “stupid” or “overdramatic.” I let that noise seep in, like, Am I being crazy for hurting this much?

Full transparency: I study psychology (PhD student) and work as a counselor, so I knew this wasn’t something I had to live with forever. But knowing and doing are two different things. I tried journaling—wrote pages of angry, messy notes and felt nothing. Talked to a mentor, did mindfulness tricks when the jealousy spiked… most of it flopped. I got so frustrated I thought, Maybe I’ll just never get over this.

But I kept messing with it. Tweaked the journaling—instead of just “I’m sad,” I wrote when it hit (mornings, mostly, or when we watched old movies) and what triggered it (that stupid coffee shop!). Slowly, like, really slowly, it got easier. The thoughts still pop up sometimes, but now I can go, “Oh, that’s just the jealousy talking”—and then turn to my partner and ask about their day instead of spiraling.

Since then, I’ve sat with a few people going through the same thing. Never tried to “fix” them—just listened, and said, “I get it. I’ve been there. You’re not alone.” That’s all I wanted when I was stuck, y’know?

I used to think I’d be stuck in that pain forever. But healing’s weird—it doesn’t happen all at once, and that’s okay. If you’re in this right now? I see you. That ache you’re feeling? It doesn’t have to be your norm. And you don’t have to carry it alone.

Has anyone else gone through this? What small thing helped you? I’m still learning, and I’d love to hear your take.",1,1759073365.0,u_Alarming_Floor9963,1,1.0,False

Idk the hype around it amazing bottle really flawless presentation. The atomizer is impressive. I was looking for a really good date night fragrance. This is 100% not it. It's spicy has vanilla but like a darker shade of vanilla. It smells a too strong for me. Also the oil feels pungnet is this what it should smell like??.  How fo perfume reviewers tell the notes i get nothing. Like yeah it is woddy vanilic it. It smells like a cheaper version of a high end coffee shop that burnt something it lacks sweetness. 

My ick with mens perfumes is they lack that sweetness or that intoxicating smell that the womens perfumes give. I am looking for a gormand and got this. I think its my fault. 

Or am i punishing it cause this is a cheaper perfume ???

I was about to buy the valentino born in roma intense but it went out of stock and the price went up when it came back so i stopped myself. Thought i will get it in december. 

Source zedaromas.com
Price around 3k 

It smells good but not my vibe for sure. Or am i just over thinking it..

Last i checked when i smell other people is if they smell good or bad. 

Cause this is my own perfume i am not able to judge please help me.

1nsr70x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsr70x,Bloody Bones (Part 3),"(( Hi everybody, I’m sorry for the delay. I’ll be honest I get in my head and don’t want to upset Wendigoon and Papa Meat with a bad story. I’m scared I’ll fall into tropes that people find annoying. Also, technical question, am I tagging right? It looks like I only get one tag.))


Hi everyone!!! Sorry for the delay. A lot has been going on. I gotta ask, do you guys ever feel….off? I mean not like I feel nauseous or I feel depressed, well, maybe depressed but not quite, ya know? I’ve been feeling very stifled, but not in the like ‘oh I can’t spread my wings’. Well, maybe in a way that. Ugh! Honestly I’ve been struggling even to put into words how I’m feeling. I’m getting more scattered brained than normal, I swear I’m a ditz. 

I just sometimes really wanna lay into people, like worse than road rage. Just bare my teeth and really tear into them. My God that sounds so cringe. Anyways, I come baring photos!!! The first one is from my driveway at night. That’s the little overgrown place I was telling you about. No the red isn’t dramatic effect, it was my tail lights LoL. 

I swear when there’s no light and it’s cloudy those trees look just like the tornado in the movie twister. It’s like it eats light. Hard to imagine it used to be a garden huh? It’s given me the creeps since we moved out here, I don’t like turning my back on it.  In the daylight it’s totally fine, I even took my best friend in there when we met for the first time (we’re online friends and she happened to be passing through so we got to finally meet), cause there were freakin vines we could swing on! Honestly, if I had to describe it as best I could, it feels like the trees themselves get freakin eyes at night and watch me.

The second photo is IN the….what would you call this area? It’s seriously just a big ole triangle of forest that used to be my grandma’s crops. Yes, that is in fact a mug hanging on a tree branch. It’s grown more than I was prepared for, last time I saw the mug it was just on a little nub. My mom says my grandpa hung them there for one reason or another, honestly no one knows why he did it. 

We just kinda chalk it up to him finishing coffee and didn’t want them to get knocked over while they gardened and just forgot, but we never got a definitive. Totally creepy right?! I do admit it’s fun to tell people about them and watch their faces. Next time I’ll try to get photos of where my grandma would say Raw Eyes lived, it’s a lot different from then but you can get a sort of gist. 

Honestly, your suggestions on story origins are amazing! I just kinda love learning about origins of folklore. For example, I know Pegasus is just one flying horse, the name isn’t his species, but what did the ancient Greeks see, smoke, hallucinate to come up with that? I was able to find an origin that talks about a scalped union soldier. I also found about Xipe Totec. 

It was totally a fluke, this little documentary popped up on my YouTube feed. His name means, the flayed one. Turns out he’s one of those mixed bag kind of Gods. He does a lot of good, and you totally want him on your side, but there’s a toll to pay. He helped with agriculture, with health, with like everything, he apparently even skinned himself just to feed the earth for the crops to grow!

Naturally it wouldn’t be an ancient latin American god without human sacrifice, but his was actually seen as an honor. It was kind of like a martyrdom, if a god was willing to peel his own skin off just to help crops grow for us lowly humans it’s the least we can do. Then he wore the skin off those sacrifices as a symbol of rebirth. He’s like a very morbid butterfly analogy. He believes that everything is created by going through the process of death, kinda like the circle of life, talk about dark Disney. 

I’m not saying an Aztec God used to stalk my mom and uncle as kids behind a rose bush, it’s just so weird to see the connections ya know? Not just the whole skinless deal…..come to think of it, my grandma was really good at gardening. Anyways, gotta get back to my day job. I just had some time to kill and a spark of motivation. As always I’d love to hear from everyone here, this is becoming a fun rabbit hole to go down.

This weekend something really unsettling happened, and I’d love some advice from other parents.

We had hard rubbish out, and a woman from around the corner (she said her name was Grace) came with her neighbour to collect our old coffee table. That part was fine — the problem was how she behaved toward my kids (ages 5 and 3).

She mostly ignored me and my husband, focusing entirely on the kids.

She called herself “Auntie,” said she doesn’t have children, and immediately wanted to know about the kids.

She offered to give me her phone number but didn’t know it.

She said she’d come over again “to play with them.”

At one point, she actually asked if she could take the kids home with her.

My 3-year-old was playing a pretend “shop” game, and Grace escalated it into trying to buy my older child’s beloved toys (including teddies).

The second time she came, she just walked into our house without permission and gave the kids money and money boxes.

Later, I realised her “water bottle” wasn’t water — she likely had alcohol with her and may have been intoxicated.

We’ve gathered all the gifts into a bag, and my husband plans to return them and tell her not to come back. But I feel rattled — it felt like boundary-crossing at best, grooming behaviour at worst. Even our friends who witnessed the first incident said it was inappropriate.


My two questions are:

1. How should we handle this kind of situation in the future? (We’re looking at a doorbell camera, and I’m considering reporting it to police, though I don’t know her surname or exact address.)

2. How can I comfort my kids after taking away the gifts? My 5-year-old was so excited about the money, and I feel awful that she’s sad. I’ve told her we’ll buy safe money boxes together, but I still want to help her understand without scaring her.

Just to clarify — I don’t know if this woman actually intended harm. It’s possible she was just intoxicated and thought she was being friendly. But from my perspective as a parent, her behaviour crossed so many boundaries that I can’t ignore it. She came into our home without permission, gave gifts against our wishes, asked to take the kids home, and tried to buy their toys. Whether she “meant well” or not, those are classic red flags. I’d rather be overprotective than risk my children’s safety.",1,1759073287.0,Advice,1,0.99,False

1nsr1ox,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsr1ox,Castilho Diego Bermudez: DAK Milky Cake e Perc Diego Bermudez M-03,"Para os entusiastas de cafés especiais, trago uma análise comparativa do icônico Castilho thermal shock do produtor **Diego Bermudez**, torrado por duas torrefações de renome internacional: **DAK** e **Perc**.

O Produtor e o Processo

Antes de aprofundar na análise sensorial, é fundamental entender a complexidade por trás deste grão. Diego Bermudez é um produtor colombiano que opera como um cientista. Em seu laboratório na Finca El Paraíso, ele utiliza uma metodologia rigorosa para inovar em processamento.

A colheita manual apenas das cerejas mais maduras é o primeiro passo. Em seguida, os grãos passam por uma sanitização com ozônio antes de serem transferidos para biorreatores, onde sofrem uma **fermentação anaeróbia por 72 horas a 20°C**, em um meio de cultura com água e *Lactobacillus*.

Após a fermentação, o café é descascado e passa por um **choque térmico** para fixar os precursores de sabor. A secagem é realizada em desumidificador por 34 horas a 35°C, garantindo a preservação dos compostos aromáticos. O grão é então estabilizado em sacos lacrados por 30 dias. O resultado deste processo é um café complexo, porém reconfortante, com perfil de especiarias doces, que evoca a sensação de um ""cinnamon roll"" ou um bolo de especiarias.



# Comparativo de Torras

**1. DAK (Milky Cake)** A torra da DAK para coados é notadamente mais clara. Essa abordagem resultou em um café de extrema **elegância**. As notas descritas pela torrefação eram de cardamomo, pistache e bolo de baunilha. Em minha avaliação sensorial, percebi um perfil com **leite, cardamomo e herbal**, com um **corpo lácteo** e uma **finalização longa**. O equilíbrio era notável, sem que nenhuma nota se sobressaísse, o que demandava atenção para captar todos os detalhes.

**2. Perc (Diego Bermudez M-03)** A torra da Perc, descrita como **bolo de especiarias e mel**, foi um pouco mais desenvolvida (provavelmente média-média), o que intensificou o perfil sensorial.

* **Método Coado:** As notas dominantes foram **especiarias** como canela e cardamomo, seguidas por um **dulçor de mel**. O corpo é **lácteo** e **untoso**, com uma **finalização persistente**. A intensidade dos sabores é o principal diferencial em relação à torra da DAK.
* **Método Espresso:** A extração resultou em uma xícara com **corpo muito encorpado e lácteo**, com a presença marcante de especiarias e uma **crema vibrante**. A finalização apresentou um leve amargor, que pode ser atribuído à falta de grão suficiente para um ajuste ideal da moagem.

This sub is unique in that I’ve learned literally nothing here. When I take on hobbies, I love hearing from experts so I can up my game and get better at what I’m doing… a habit left over from over a decade as a fancy pants of a chef. Every post is “look at this monstrosity I made that hides all of that nasty matcha flavor!” It’s insane to me that people would spend so much money on a hobby they don’t actually like. 

I assume people have “bought in” with the tools because it’s trendy and don’t want to give up because of that initial investment. Look folks… it’s obvious you don’t like matcha. It’s okay to admit that and go back to coffee, black tea, or whatever.

1nsqxl6,https://i.redd.it/5x5qt2f4axrf1.jpeg,why Cecil even feels the need to lie and keep this a secret from Mark and the whole group?,"That's what I don't get.
.Dude, you are working with people who want to save the world and help others as much as you do.
What good does it even do keeping this crap a secret from them?

Like dude,you need Mark way more then he needs you, why the hell are you even keeping a secret from him?

And people saying that it ""doesn't concern Mark"" and Cecil shouldn't have to tell him is crazy knowing he's their ace and their biggest line of defense and the guy they'll be running for to save them.

You're basically saying that Mark is old enough to where he has to basically die for this planet and go through unspeakable horrors no one his age should go through but not old enough to where he has to be informed on matters that obviously are personal on him.

We literally saw a episode where Rick, Mark's friend, had his life basically ruined by Sinclair to the point where he almost killed himself had it not been for Donald and Mark was there for that.

Seriously he could've shot this man a email and a conversation over Coffee and it would go much smoother.

Mark was crashing out cause not only was he already in a stressful situation but he had no time or even buildup to finding out that someone who tortured numerous people + people close to him was basically given a comfy job with all the resources he wants.

Like Sinclair has 0 redeeming qualities and is just a big douchebag in general and Mark obviously wasn't gonna be automatically cool with Frankenstein Jr here being out.


Dude was justified to be angry and Cecil could've stayed in his office and made it clear he hates Sinclair as much as Mark does and feels dirty even being in same room as him but he's useful and that he will be used for what he's needed and he'll go back to his jail cell where he belongs and even then, he'll be monitored 24/7 for in case he steps out of line. 

Heck, Cecil could've solved this months ago by giving Mark a heads up and making it clear that he's nothing more then their prisoner and Mark wouldn't love it but at least it wouldn't get so bad to the point where the Guardians would split and he loses his best Asset and ally.

And Mark unironically acted much better then a younger Cecil did when he was forced to work with 2 bad guys at a younger age.

Seriously being all ""my way or the highway"" and ""shut up,sit down and follow orders"" is really only useful in the short term and dealing with villains but that is not how you should be when dealing with Heroes who are good and want to protect and help others. 

And it's pretty obvious Cecil acting this sloppy and even this reckless in S3 is purely cause he's a egomaniac control freak who tries/is trying to overcompensate for his physical powerlessness by big dogging everyone here. 

It doesn't take a Genius to know that Cecil is clearly is irrational and shaken up cause of what happened with Nolan and is trying hard and desperately looking + clinging onto anything that will make Mark less of a issue in case of mind control.

It's one of the biggest reasons even behind this conflict outside of his control issues. 

None of it is actually Mark's fault cause he does deserve basic human trust and respect after all he's been through but Cecil just hates the idea he's powerless to stop Mark like how he was against Nolan.

He'e paranoid to a Borderline extreme fault and that may be justified considering his job but it also shows how quick he is to see anyone he can't control or put on a leash as a threat.

And the biggest reason for all of this and his reasoning for lying and hiding crap from others is cause he's a Massive Control Freak. 

He has good points but his biggest flaw(s)are not only a insatiable need to always be in control but also the fact that he has to have the largest stick in any given time and for everyone to know it and his shtick breaks down if anyone doubts his stick.

Mark comes in aggravated and questioning his stick with his own massive one that's much bigger than Cecil and he can't allow or accept the fact that Mark has a much bigger stick than him.

So he takes Mark to the white room and waves his stick around and says it's much bigger then his and when that stick snaps ,Cecil pulls out a even bigger one.

Mark is obviously not happy about this and goes to leave but Cecil isn't done proving how big his stick is and that he's the big dog so they end up at the HQ. 

Everyone there is questioning what's going on but Cecil basically goes ""shut up, my stick is bigger then yours and my stick is much bigger than his.""

He's only fine with having his Stick Questioned only if it means he can show off how big it is or or he uses underhanded tactics to get a much larger piece of wood.

Deterrents are for enemies, not allies and as we see for Cecil, those are juat as much for his own allies he works for as much as the Enemies he's hired.

What practical reason does Cecil have to even keep it a secret and lie to them about Sinclair and Darkwing if you're so convinced that they're needed to save the world?
That should've been discussed over Coffee and tea and as a Team.

Cecil also seems to not know the phrase ""speak softly and carry a big stick.""
He knows about Carrying a big stick but he only really speaks softly as long as he's confident he has the biggest stick in the park.

People are all like ""why is everyone so hard on Cecil when he's just trying to save the world"" and it's cause the dude is someone with good intentions but also is a controlling Jerk with a ego problem who is as quick to put a weapon in his allies if they even show a hint of defiance and lack of control.

Like being right doesn't mean much if you're such a Jerk that it makes people not wanna even trust you considering a job like his requires people to trust him and he's actually bad at doing that and keeping that trust from breaking.

1nsqwlt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nsqwlt,Free ChatGPT is fine. ChatGPT Plus prints time. 10 upgrades you get in the $20 a month plan that make it worth it.  Here are the cool features in ChatGPT Plus,"**TL;DR: Paying $20/month for ChatGPT Plus isn't just for better answers; it's like hiring a team of specialized assistants. You get a deep researcher, a custom-coded bot builder, a video/image creator, and an autonomous agent that can manage multi-step tasks for you. It's a massive productivity upgrade that remembers your preferences and can be tailored to your exact workflow.**

I talk to a lot of people about whether the $20/month for ChatGPT Plus is ""worth it.""  About 90% of people use the free version of ChatGPT and tell me it is not good enough for them.   As someone who uses it daily, I wanted to break down why it's one of the best investments you can make in your personal and professional growth. This isn't just about getting faster answers; it's about unlocking a suite of powerful tools that can fundamentally change how you work, learn, and create.

Here’s a deep dive into the features that make it a no-brainer.

# 1. Superior Intelligence & Comprehensive Answers

The free version is a great taste, but the Plus version is the full-course meal.

* **Benefit:** Plus users get priority access to the latest, most powerful parts of ChatGPT. The responses are not only more nuanced and accurate, but they are also significantly longer and more detailed. This is crucial when you're tackling complex topics, writing code, or drafting detailed documents.
* **Example:** Ask the free version to explain quantum computing, and you'll get a decent summary. Ask the Plus version, and you can get a detailed paper with analogies, potential applications, and key challenges, all in one go.
* **Pro-Tip:** If a response is good but not quite deep enough, simply reply with ""Go deeper on point number 3"" or ""Expand on this with real-world examples.""

# 2. Your Personalized AI Assistant (Custom Instructions)

This is one of the most underrated features. You can tell ChatGPT *how* you want it to behave across all your conversations.

* **Benefit:** You bake your preferences right into the AI. It saves you from having to repeat instructions in every new chat, making your workflow incredibly efficient. It's the difference between hiring a new freelancer for every task versus having a full-time assistant who already knows how you operate.
* **Example:** In your settings, you can add instructions like the ones below to get consistently sharp, actionable advice:*You are my expert strategist. For every response, include: 1) A direct, actionable answer. 2) A short breakdown of why. 3) 2–3 alternative approaches. 4) One next step I can take right now. Keep it concise. Prefer decisions over options. State assumptions if info is missing. Tell it like it is.*
* **Pro-Tip:** Create different custom instructions for different tasks. Have one for creative writing, another for technical code reviews, and a third for business analysis. You can easily toggle them as needed.

# 3. Effortless Deep Research (Web Browsing & Analysis)

Tired of having 50 tabs open? Let the AI do the heavy lifting.

* **Benefit:** ChatGPT Plus can browse the web in real-time to conduct deep research, read documentation, and synthesize information from dozens of sources into a single, comprehensive report. This saves countless hours of manual research.
* **Example:** Instead of spending a weekend reading reviews for a new laptop, you can ask: *""Research the top 3 laptops for video editing under $2000 released in 2025. Create a comparison table covering specs, performance benchmarks, screen quality, and battery life. Summarize the expert consensus from sites like The Verge, Linus Tech Tips, and MKBHD.""*
* **Pro-Tip:** Be extremely specific in your request. Provide links to starting points, mention key experts or websites to consult, and define the exact structure of the output you want (e.g., ""give me a markdown table,"" ""write a 500-word summary"").

# 4. Full Creative Control (Image & Video Generation)

This is where things get really fun and powerful. Plus gives you access to state-of-the-art creative tools.   Stock images used to be a very expensive thing for marketers that needed images for a blog or social media post and now you can get the exact image you need in about 30 seconds.  

* **Benefit:** You can generate stunning, high-resolution images and even create short video clips with Sora, directly within the chat interface. It’s an end-to-end creative suite for social media content, presentations, or just bringing your ideas to life.
* **Example:** ""Create a photorealistic image of an astronaut riding a horse on Mars, cinematic lighting."" Then follow up with, ""Now, create a 5-second video of this scene, with the horse slowly trotting forward.""
* **Pro-Tip:** Iterate on your images. After generating an image, you can say, ""Now make it in a vintage, 1950s sci-fi art style,"" or ""Change the aspect ratio to 16:9 for a YouTube thumbnail.""

# 5. Build Your Own AI Army (Custom GPTs)

You don't need to be a programmer to build your own custom AI tools.

* **Benefit:** You can create specialized versions of ChatGPT that are pre-loaded with specific instructions, knowledge, and skills for any task imaginable. You can keep them for personal use or share them with the world.
* **Example:**
   * **""Keto Chef GPT"":** Tell it the ingredients you have, and it will give you a keto-friendly recipe.
* **Pro-Tip:** Start with a simple idea. Use the GPT builder's conversational interface to tell it what you want it to do. You can upload documents (like a style guide or API documentation) to give it specific knowledge.

# 6. The Autonomous Agent (Multi-Step Task Execution)

This feels like the future is already here. Agent mode lets ChatGPT take action on your behalf.

* **Benefit:** The AI can perform complex, multi-step tasks across different applications and websites with minimal supervision. It's the ultimate time-saver for routine administrative and research work.
* **Example:** *""Scan my calendar for the next week, find a 30-minute open slot for a meeting with John, check his public calendar to confirm availability, and draft an email to him proposing three potential time slots.""*
* **Pro-Tip:** Start with simple, low-stakes tasks to understand its capabilities. For example, have it organize files in your cloud storage or summarize a long chain of emails before you try to have it book travel.

7.  With the Plus version of ChatGPT you can also connect your email, calendar, and task list to ChatGPT and it can act as your personal assistant for many functions.  

# Is $20 a month worth it for ChatGPT plus?

For me, the answer is a resounding yes. For the price of a few coffees, you're not just buying a better chatbot. You're investing in a powerful platform that acts as your researcher, assistant, creator, and agent. It's a tool that, if used correctly, can easily save you 5-10 hours a week and unlock creative and professional potential you didn't know you had.

If you're on the fence, I highly recommend trying it for a month and exploring these features. The jump from the free version is bigger than you think.",3,1759072583.0,ThinkingDeeplyAI,1,1.0,False

1nsqvv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nsqvv0/stories_of_an_unassuming_bike_rental_shop_chapter/,Stories of an unassuming bike rental shop - CHAPTER 1,"  


Strange lights dance before my eyes, I can almost make out shapes, here; an 8-ball, a human face, a prancing dog. But as soon as my eyes try to focus on them, they become formless lights again. I can feel the presence behind me, whispering eldritch truths. The problem with those is a normal dude like me can’t understand them. So I just tune out the unknowable speech until it’s nothing more than white noise as I gaze upon the lights slowly drifting above the abyss. I’ve been having this dream often recently, I realize. Not my first recurring oniric journey by far, but I’m more used to the “classroom shame” type, though even these ones get weird, like that one time I spat out hundreds of live eels and they started flying,.. but that’s neither here nor there. Gripping my thoughts tighter, I gaze down at the hungering abyss below the lights and feel a shudder pass, better to keep on the lights then. And so i drift and the lights keep gently soothing me and they dance and dance and dance and dance-



I wake with a jolt at my alarm, you know the one, the annoying Iphone one everyone has heard at least once and hates. I keep it because of that hate though, it’s what gets me to wake up to turn it off, it’s what fuels me to forge on ahead with my day, to prove the smug alarm wrong, that I do have my life together, even if it’s wishful thinking. Morning preparations pass in a blur, at some points routine becomes so numb you start doing them without realizing, like when I leave my room with the blinds open, and come back to them close, i just do it without realizing it. It’s 7:03 by the time I’m done, not my best time, but not my worst by far, I’ll be 30 minutes early today, but that’s nothing new. 



The ride on the metro always feels like a second dream, the darkness of the underground and the few dim lights on the tunnel walls blending to create this weird hazy atmosphere. The people all present in a small spot, doing nothing, yet somehow so far from each other, each one in their own little pocket of reality, barely aware of each other. Yet I watch them, not intently, no more than one sweep of my eyes per person, but that feeling of surveying the people as they are in their bubble in this public space that feels more private than many fills me with a confidence, a form of understanding of my own reality by watching others.



 Lost in thought, I almost miss my stop, but a well timed gaze of the wall shows me we’ve arrived, “The Weapons Palace”, always so ominous with the towering justice building leading to the port. As usual, it takes me 5 to 7 minutes to make my way from the palace down to the Old Port, a place of wonder and horror all the like. At least in the morning there aren't too many weird happenings, but I still take my precautions and avoid the dim lit alleys that appear invitingly as shortcuts. Sure it makes the trip longer, but it’s a cost I’m more than willing to pay after what happened last Summer. 



I suppose now’s as good a time as any to give a small explanation of my job and place of employment, as I sit on the ancient stone stairs and wait for my coworkers on my phone. I’m an intendant (a rather dull title that in actuality represents a whole lot of responsibilities) for the City’s best (and only easily accessible to the uncommon mortal or not) bike rental shop! Come on Mondays for 25% off! Don’t ask why, no, there’s nothing weird going on at the Island on Monday, just don’t go there okay. Alright, promotions aside, it’s a pretty amazing job, most of it is moving bikes from the front shop to our little plot of land on the port, and talking to customers, which are typically tourists from all over the world! Sometimes they’re from places I've never even heard about, and I had a history major in high school. 



So anyways, I’ll keep you guys posted with interesting stuff that happens at work during my breaks. There’s already quite a backlog of fun stories I want to share, so most of these will be in the past, but I'll still write them in the present for the sake of clarity. 

  


**CHAPTER 1: A HOT DAY AND WORKING IN THE BASEMENT**

The heat today might just kill me. That and the sounds from the Basement. Truly a pick your poison type of situation: scorch under the City’s strange sun that burns and summons rain at a moment’s notice with no clouds; or toil in the Basement and be subject to its sounds that feel like nails on a chalkboard, it’s many tripping hazards, it’s ceiling so low i have to be almost crouching, and that’s not to mention the unknown of its too many hallways and how it’s somehow way bigger than the building it’s sitting under. 



Well, there’s some small graces, I don’t have to make that choice today; Manager just told me I’ll have to do a bit of both today. 



As I walk back inside the smooth air conditioned interior of our shop, I spot today’s Manager leaning on the counter. He’s a brown haired, short and hunched, 30-something year old man, with a face full of faults; crooked teeth, long nose, uneven chin. And yet, he always has this air upon him that makes him striking. Shrinking back with dread (which is a comical image if you can picture that he’s almost half my height) I dare ask “Is the Owner here today?”. 



As the quickly stammered out words leave my lips before I can think better of it, the air itself seems to still, the entire store seems too quiet, even the usual clanking of the Mechanic’s workshop we typically hear faintly is eerily absent. The Manager turns his slightly crossed eyes to me, his uneven gaze managing to still be searing. He rasps under his breath “He won’t be here this week, but keep your tongue to yourself, boy.” and gives a pointed look to the general direction of the glinting of one of the many hidden cameras. 

I know they can’t detect sound, but a chill nonetheless passes through me despite the scalding heat outside at the idea that He could very well be watching right now. Deciding to try and move on, I ask “So, what are we guys to do with all that heat today”, “Well, he says, we aren’t getting customers for another half hour, so why don’t you guys grab extra bikes from under and bring them to our plot while I sort out our overdue paperwork?”.



 Knowing better than to ask for another assignment, I give a curt nod and make my way to the Basement, knowing damn well than despite there being 3 other intendants here with me today, I’ll have to be the one to go down there, “you’re the one who can weather it the best after all”, they’ll say.

So I grimly make my way through our store, first through our long customer service section with its gleaming metal counters and many maps of the shifting lanes of the City. Then through our products section where we keep a handful of bike products in the event of a non client needing them and walks by our store (happens more than you’d think). Then I pass in front of the workshop, making sure not to actually set foot in the place since today the one holding the shift is the old Hob faced one, and I’d find myself with a wrench thrown at me full force if I did get too close to the forges. 



Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I arrive at the very back of our store, where there’s old rusted lift to get heavy objects down into and from the basement, the little staircase that’s so narrow you can barely fit through it, and the employee room and kitchen to either sides of the instalment. I stop by to take a sip of coffee, a nice reminder of the cleverness of the Owner’s design for the shop; by placing the break room and kitchen right next to the Basement’s entrance, he’d ensured that we would only go there for our actual breaks or in cases of true need. Anyways, enough stalling. Setting one unsure foot on the first small wooden step of the staircase, I inhale deeply, then take the plunge.



The atmosphere in the basement always hits you in parts. First, there’s the strange, almost comforting, feel of stillness. You know the old attic at your grandparent’s place, with dim orange light going through the cracks in the roof, and dust particles being visible through the beams of light? It feels like that, even though there’s no luminous beams nor dust clouds. Yet there’s this feeling, this strange moment where you think everything has gone still, that the world itself is catching its breath, as you first enter the Basement.



 And then there’s the second part; mystery. Many things don’t make sense in this shop, Heck, many things don’t make sense in this City. But there’s something about the Basement that always strikes out when you enter, even if you’ve never been in it before. How it’s definitely bigger than the building that sits above it, despite all logic making you think you’d be under the river only a couple of steps into it. How there’s an unknown amount of hallways twisting out from the main shape of the place. How you can find seemingly anything you could be looking for, except water.



The third part is always the worst, the sound. It doesn’t necessarily happen right after the first two parts. Sometimes you spend tens of minutes in the Basement before it happens. Sometimes you do whatever you need to do and exit and it doesn’t even show up. But it always comes back, and you never expect it. Today it hit me mere seconds after getting my bearings in the dim lit environment. The loud, indescribable blaring that seems to come from all around you, and deep from your bones at the same time. I’ve heard people argue over what it is and what it sounds like a lot more than you’d think. To some, it is akin to being right next to one of those large cargo ships foghorn as it goes off. To others, they swear it’s the sound of a nuclear siren. The only thing we all agree on is that it rattles you to your very core whenever it catches you. And it does, always. And there’s the other half of the sound, the somehow even less sensible one; the images. The sheer brutality of the sound seems to every time, no matter what or who, fill the person’s head with images of flesh, of meat, of skin.



There are benefits to being sent here though. First is the most obvious; since no one else, not even the managers, wants to be here if they can help it, that usually means I’ll be nice and alone down here. And the lack of a camera means that working in the Basement is primo time to be on my phone and write more of this. Of course I need to keep an eye on the time to not be suspicious, but I’m used to that. The other, more subtle benefit, is the stillness I mentioned before. Of course this is dependent on the raking and clanking being absent, but even when it appears, it usually fades in a few minutes. To be more precise, being alone in the basement feels the same as what most people I imagine feel in their own bedrooms. A feeling of security and privacy, of being able to be truly yourself without anyone to judge. It’s nice.



So, phone in hand and writing more of this as I go, I advance further in the liminal space. Passing by many branching corridors I’ve never seen before, I try to stay focused on my goal. Which, writing this, now would be a good time as any to explain why I’m down here today in the first place. The manager earlier didn’t see fit to explain it, as it was quite obvious (to me). You see, on particularly hot days like these, we often run out of bikes in the front shop at midday at best. So my current goal is to locate some extra large men’s bikes, and small women’s bikes, as those two are the ones we run out of the fastest. Thankfully the basement appears to contain anything and everything you could be looking for, as long as it’s not water.



I reach the first threshold, a small door full of holes, with a red “EXIT” glowing sign above it. All the employees know it doesn’t actually lead to an exit, and the long, winding and dark corridor visible through the holes is hopefully hint enough for anyone who *doesn’t* know.

Thankfully, I spotted a large rack of bikes to my left. I don’t have to risk a threshold today after all. Peering at the bikes neatly arranged, I manage to locate two extra larges, and a small. Great, now to get them off. You have to understand that with the sheer amount of bikes we have, they have to be \*extremely\* tightly arranged if we are to hold them all in. Now, my best friend, who is working on buying the shop from The Owner (but that’s a whole other can of worms for another day) is keen on selling a ton of them to save space, but that’s neither here, nor there. 

Meaning i have to move approximately a dozen bikes just to get the three i’m looking for. Right. 

Well, you get used to it.



It’s been a bit. Climbing back onto the large rusted metal cargo elevator with the bikes in tow, I grab the bright yellow control remote, a stark contrast to the damp darkness of the basement. The thrum of machinery around me rattles as the contraption begins its slow ascent back to a more civilized world. It’s funny how in any other context in this city, underground is synonymous to security, to peace. But in this shop, it’s a dreaded concept. What I'm trying to say is the actual transit period between below and aboveground is easily my favourite thing about the Basement. It’s this sort of quiet, in between, moment (despite the clicking and clanking noise) where everything seems suspended. Nothing really matters, all I’m doing is pressing the remote and holding the bikes so they don’t fall off in the deep below. There’s a beauty to that, I believe.



Alright, now that I’ve done the work, it’s time to do the work. You might think I’m joking, or making a pun, but anyone who’s ever worked in retail will tell you there’s always something to do. No matter what. Honestly I think there might even be some twisted divine game to that. Anyways, to sound less cryptic it just means I need to actually sort the bikes now. Bringing them to the front of the store, I give a jolly little middle finger to the manager, who responds with two of his own. That’s one of the things I truly enjoy about this job, the lightness of the tone, it probably helps that my best friend since middle school works here too, though to do him justice I will try not to talk too much about him until I give him a whole chapter of his own.



Anyways, to the more pressing matter at hand, I make my way to the clients who were waiting for their bikes the whole time. I hand them the goods, apologizing in the way we retail workers do: “I’m so sorry that the thing out of my control made you have to wait longer”. I obviously don’t word it that way, but that’s how it is. The clients’ sort of opaque eyes seem unfocused, and they give me a very half-assed response in their broken English. They’re the annoying type who speak none of the City’s official languages, and barely hold their own in american english, so working with them feels almost like working as an interpreter too. I never know where they come from, their accent is unrecognizable, their face unremarkable, and their native language unknown. So I don't feel too bad about them having to wait, after all, I had to wait for them to understand our system and make proper requests.



The rest of the day after this was pretty empty, some new clients here and there, but nothing too different from anything I’ve described so far, so I think I’ll just end this chapter here. If you guys have any questions about my work or this City I’d love to try and tackle them in Chapter 2, in the meantime I’m working on an interlude that will cover a different piece of my story.

I lived in lakeview for about 8 years. I moved away about 3 years ago for family reasons, but try to visit at least once a year because I desperately miss Chicago. 

I will be in back in a couple weeks for a really short trip, just two full days. I have a few of my local haunts that I’m itching to get back to, but other than that, I’d like to check out some areas/spots I haven’t been before. 

I know that’s pretty vague, but open to recommendations. Imagine you were just doing a staycation in Chicago and wanted to check out some neighborhoods or restaurants/coffee shops/shops you didn’t frequent often. I’ll be staying right near a red/brown line station but not opposed to springing for Ubers as needed. I’m also not a big drinker, but I would have a cocktail in the right setting. 

Honestly, I know no matter what I do, just being back in a walkable city in the fall will be what the doctor ordered.

Whether it’s brewing a quick cup with a pod or crafting a rich carafe with freshly ground coffee, this machine does it all with ease. With its sleek black finish and compact dimensions, the design sits perfectly on my kitchen counter without feeling obtrusive. The ability to brew coffee from both grounds and pods is a game-changer, especially in a household where preferences vary. For someone who juggles a busy daily routine, the convenience this coffee maker offers is invaluable. Of course, there are aspects to love and a few quirks that might need consideration.

**Key Features and Brewing Options**  
As someone who enjoys experimenting with different coffee styles, the versatility of this machine truly stands out. With its 4 brew styles—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty—you can fine-tune the result to match your exact mood or drink preference. I gave all these options a try, and while the Classic brew delivers a balanced and smooth cup, the Rich setting works great when you want a bit more punch. The Over Ice setting was perfect for whipping up summer iced coffees that didn’t taste watered down, which my kids were all too eager to enjoy. What truly sets this product apart is the Specialty Brew setting, which creates a concentrated coffee base ideal for making cappuccinos, macchiatos, and lattes. The built-in milk frother added to the fun, helping me recreate that café-style experience at home.

**Appearance and Footprint**  
Its sophisticated black plastic body might not scream luxury, but it gets points for practicality. The unit feels sturdy yet lightweight, weighing just over 9.5 pounds. It’s also relatively compact for a coffee maker that boasts both carafe and single-serve functions, measuring 15.5 x 11.4 x 9.1 inches. The detachable water reservoir is thoughtfully designed, making refilling neat and straightforward. When entertaining guests or prepping for the week ahead, the glass carafe holds up to 12 cups of coffee, offering plenty of capacity.

**Faster Brewing and Usability**  
Speed is critical in my mornings, so the claim of faster brewing than leading competitors was worth testing. Ninja wasn’t kidding—the K-cup brewing time is practically instant upon startup. Whether you’re brewing a single 6 oz pod cup or going for a full carafe, the machine delivers without long delays, which I really appreciated before heading to work. The separate hot water system comes in handy for non-coffee tasks like making oatmeal, instant soups, or quick hot cocoa for my nieces.

[Check Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0btp84qm5/)  

**Strengths**  
A few clear positives became evident during use:  
- Offers dual brewing capabilities for both grounds and pods.
- 4 brew styles allow customization for every taste preference.  
- Includes a milk frother for crafting specialty drinks.  
- Separate hot water dispenser with two temperature settings adds versatility.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
However, nothing is perfect, and there are some minor areas for adjustment:  
- The plastic material of the machine, while lightweight, feels less premium compared to higher-end units.  
- The glass carafe, though functional, isn’t insulated, meaning brewed coffee cools quickly if left out.  
- Cleaning the milk frother can require extra effort due to its small components.

**Competing Brands**  
In comparison to direct competitors like the Keurig K-Duo and the Breville Bambino Plus, the Ninja CFP301 DualBrew Pro strikes a unique balance of versatility and functionality. The Keurig K-Duo also supports both pods and grounds use, but it lacks the Specialty Brew option and built-in frother, which are huge benefits with this machine. On the other hand, while the Breville Bambino Plus excels in creating rich espresso, it isn’t as versatile for different brewing needs like drip coffee or iced options. For a household looking for a multipurpose coffee station, the Ninja model holds an edge.

**Worth Every Penny**  
While this machine isn’t priced in the ‘budget’ category, its feature set justifies the higher cost. The customizable brewing options, dual pod-and-ground system, and easy functionality make it feel like you’re getting multiple machines in one compact design. Compared to buying separate single-serve and full-carafe models, this product consolidates everything beautifully, saving both money and counter space. For anyone who loves variety in their coffee experience, it’s worth considering.

We didn't have much in common. I was on entry level position. The company had around 700 people hired locally. And he was the top guy. We heard stories of him being very harsh and uptight, strict, mean. I had a weird crush on him even though I saw him just once face to face (Closely) - at the office coffee shop. He was very tall, had a button down shirt, short hair, blue icy eyes that were so cold and a pretty nice built.

Only a few years later I had my first interaction with him and it happened in a meeting via Teams. he made me feel bad about a mistake my colleague did, but he didn't care and just took it all out on me, raised his voice, talked down to me, asked me questions like: are you capable to at least follow what I am telling you?"" I felt so bad and ashamed. He didn't allow me to speak, he kept cutting me off with mean remarks. Finally I resigned, but not because of this, unrelated reasons.

Now I am 30 and he is 46 and we met randomly at a local event. He didn't remember me but when I told him my name he was like: you that girl that told me to watch my tone (he was friendly). I said, yeah. We kept talking for another 20 minutes. Then he invited me for a drink at the bar. He said he remembers the incident and said he feels very sorry for it and he respected me for telling him to watch his tone even if he didn't show it.  Managerial positions are very stressful and sometimes he loses his temper but is working on it to happen less often. I ended up at his place and we had sex. I didn't spend the night.

I asked the next day a woman who works there if he has changed since then (I didn' tell her what happened) and she said he is even worse. So he didn't probably say the truth. Well, but now I keep thinking about this. He did not ask for a contact detail from me so I guess he doesn't want to hear of me anymore. Would it be too much if I followed him on Linkedin?

Considering the cost of the leases, front desk staff, leasehold improvements, office furniture, heat, hydro, cleaners, signage, maintenance costs, even the free coffee they offered put them in a vulnerable position. This combined with their low fees doomed the company when transactions hit a decade’s low for a sustained period of time.

It’s worth considering that agents themselves may have played a role in shaping this unsustainable model. Many agents demanded traditional real estate services — bricks and mortar locations, front desk staff, photocopiers, meeting rooms — yet acknowledged they rarely used them. At the same time, those same agents pushed for lower fees because they “didn’t use the services.” This environment encouraged brokerage owners to provide costly infrastructure and overhead despite the fact that the model was not sustainable long term.

Since real estate is self-regulated, the founder(s) of iPro Realty and potentially many other brokerage  owners are put in the bad position of watching their company fail, or—given the lack of proper oversight—taking/stealing/borrowing from their trust accounts and hoping they don’t get caught before the market improves.

The reality of today’s real estate industry is that many traditional brokerage models are still clinging to outdated practices that no longer reflect how business is done. For example, clients have not been required to sign real estate contracts in ink for more than a decade — secure digital signatures are now the standard. Digital documentation, app based photo cheque deposits, and cloud-based transaction platforms and zoom meetings  give clients convenience, speed, and transparency, eliminating the need to travel to an office. Given these technologies, it’s no surprise that clients no longer want — or expect — to visit a traditional real estate office.  
From an agent standpoint, they can get documents signed far easier, collect or deposit cheques using wire transfers or even app based cheque photo deposits remotely and much more.  Even an agents pay can be made same day of closing via E.T.F before the money is even received by the brokerage. 

As a result, many of the old brokerage models are simply no longer profitable. iPro Realty is a case in point. The company grew quickly by attracting agents who demanded traditional services combined with low fees. While this strategy appealed to agents in the short term, it also created a fragile business model. When the market slowed, the low-fee structure and heavy office overhead left the brokerage and its agents exposed — effectively sealing their own fate.

The lesson is clear: today’s clients and agents require a model that is both modern and sustainable. Any brokerage that fails to evolve is increasingly at risk. REALTORS® are making a serious business decision when evaluating what company they will move to.

This is exactly why the fastest-growing real estate company in the world, eXp Realty, is built on a completely different model from traditional brokerages. Unlike franchises or privately owned companies, eXp Realty operates as one global company that is publicly traded.  Because eXp Realty is publicly traded and governed by the SEC, it operates under far greater scrutiny than even government-run oversight would provide creating safety and securing for both its agents and clients. 

Instead of owning physical offices, eXp enhances service for its agents through innovative solutions that save money and increase service to agents:

* 56 Regus office locations throughout the GTA, available free to agents
* A cloud-based metaverse office staffed with more than 1,000 support professionals, accessible anywhere with an internet connection 

To put eXp’s strength into perspective:  
According to public market data, eXp’s market capitalization is approximately $1.74 billion, while RE/MAX’s (arguably the largest brand name in the industry) market capitalization is reported in the range of $200–$320 million. This means eXp is several times larger than RE/MAX — and by some measures, more than eight times more valuable. 

eXp Realty carries no debt and shares 50% of its revenue with agents. With annual revenues exceeding $4 billion, this represents an extraordinary value proposition for agents.

For REALTORS® seeking long-term security and stability for themselves and their clients, no model compares. Agents also benefit from ownership opportunities in the form of company stock, ensuring that top producers are directly aligned with the success of others in the company.

As one example of this collaborative culture, the Honey Badgers group within eXp Realty gives agents access to a $50,000/month marketing and implementation team — at no cost.

I go with the questions:

1.- I plan to add a little Kanna to my morning coffee. Since I have read that it helps improve mood in general, and sometimes I have depressive tendencies. Could this develop any tolerance? Could it be less effective if I use it for PE if I take it daily?

2.- This extract is a 20:1 concentrate, what type of dose would be needed? I speak in terms of daily use, and in terms of sexy time, I imagine that when using it for sex, the dose should be a little higher? Any advice on how to weigh it? (I don't have a scale that weighs milligrams) But I imagine there is some way to approximate the required dose.

3.- How long before sex should I consume it? My plan is to use it sublingually (I had planned to use 50mg sublingually before sex) but I have read experiences that talk about HOURS before sex, and others that talk about 30 minutes or just 15... I think this could be the biggest doubt I have.

I would like to hear all your thoughts on this, whether a thought is overtuned or way too much of a nerf/buff. Just a general discussion.
If you maybe have ideas for how other killers could work in a 2v8 scenario let everyone see as well.

1nsqhky,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1nsqhky/never_never_part_2_by_colleen_hoover_never_never/,Never Never Part 2 By Colleen Hoover (Never Never Series Book 2),"Hey fellow readers!

I just finished diving back into the world of Charlie and Silas with **[Never Never Part 2 By Colleen Hoover (Never Never Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/never-never-part-2/)**, and oh boy, did the mystery truly deepen in this romance! If you're a fan of a good ""what just happened?"" kind of story wrapped up in an emotional package, you'll want to hear about this one.

### What's It All About (No Spoilers, I Promise!)

In this second part of the ""Never Never"" series, we continue to follow Charlie and Silas, two teenagers who wake up one day having lost all their memories of each other, their lives, and their relationship. They were deeply in love, but now they're strangers, trying to piece together a past that seems to be actively hiding from them. Part 2 picks up right where the first left off, with more secrets coming to light and the stakes getting even higher. It’s all about rediscovering who they are, who they were to each other, and why their memories vanished. It’s less about typical romance and more about a psychological puzzle with a romantic undercurrent.

### What I Really Liked

Honestly, what really got me was **Colleen Hoover's writing style**. She has this amazing way of making you feel exactly what the characters are feeling. Charlie and Silas's confusion and desperation were so real, and their journey to understand their past was genuinely compelling. The way their old selves and new selves clashed, and how they tried to navigate love in a memory vacuum, was incredibly well done.

The **pacing** in this installment felt a bit faster than the first, with more revelations trickling in, keeping me glued to the pages. Just when you think you're getting somewhere, another twist makes you question everything. It's a true page-turner in that sense. I also loved the emotional depth – the feeling of loss even for memories you can't recall, and the struggle to trust in feelings you can't explain, resonated deeply.

### A Few Things to Consider

To be completely balanced, if you're looking for a clear-cut mystery with definitive clues and a big ""aha!"" moment, this might not be it in the traditional sense. The mystery is more about the characters' internal journey and their relationship, rather than a whodunit. Also, as this is Part 2, be prepared for more questions than answers by the end. It definitely leaves you wanting to pick up the final book immediately! If you haven't read Part 1, you absolutely need to start there, as this book won't make sense on its own.

### My Recommendation

I'd definitely recommend **[Never Never Part 2 By Colleen Hoover (Never Never Series Book 2)](https://pdfhive.com/never-never-part-2/)** to anyone who enjoyed the first book (obviously!). It's also great for casual readers who appreciate a good psychological mystery mixed with romance, or those who love character-driven stories with a strong emotional core. If you enjoy Colleen Hoover's other works but are looking for something with a unique twist, this series is a fantastic departure from her usual.

### A Little Encouragement for New Readers!

If you're new to reading or haven't picked up a book in a while, don't stress about diving into a series. It's a great way to get hooked!

Here’s a little step-by-step guide and some tips:
1.  **Start with the First Book:** Always begin at the beginning of a series. For this one, that means `Never Never Part 1`.
2.  **Find Your Spot:** Get comfy! A cozy chair, a quiet corner, or even a bustling coffee shop can be your reading haven.
3.  **Give It Time:** Don't feel pressured to finish quickly. Read at your own pace. Sometimes a few pages a day is all you need.
4.  **Embrace the Story:** Let yourself get lost in the world of the book. Don't worry about analyzing everything; just enjoy the ride.

Reading should be a fun and relaxing escape. There's no right or wrong way to do it. Just pick up a book and see where it takes you. If you're looking for an engaging mystery with a strong emotional pull, I highly suggest checking out `Never Never`.

I’m a university professor looking to connect with someone who enjoys deeper conversations beyond the usual small talk.

A bit about me: I’m passionate about reading (currently working through Haruki Murakami’s catalog and always have a biography or history book on the side), love to travel when time permits (recent favorites include Portugal and Morocco), and try to stay active with tennis and CrossFit. There’s something energizing about discussing a great book over coffee or sharing travel stories with someone who actually wants to hear them.

I’d love to find someone who appreciates good conversation - whether that’s debating the merits of a novel, planning future adventures, or just talking about life. Age and background don’t matter as much as curiosity and kindness.

If you’re someone who thinks books make great gifts, believes travel changes perspective, or knows that the best conversations happen when you lose track of time, I’d enjoy hearing from you.

What I already did: cleaned the brew group and around the brew group, also got some new red o-rings for it.

I’m a hopeless romantic through and through, and I’m looking for a lover who can match my energy, someone who’s all in for a deep, passionate connection in a polyamorous setup.

I’m demisexual, so it’s all about that emotional spark for me. Once we connect, you’re the one I’ll be thinking about nonstop, the one I want to share every little moment with. I’d love someone to talk to every day—quick texts to make you smile, long calls where we get lost in each other’s stories, or just swapping silly memes that scream “us.” If you’re in Louisville or nearby, let’s make it real: coffee dates in cozy cafes, walks through the fall leaves holding hands, or quiet nights where we just vibe together. But I’m also totally down for long-distance—video chats that feel like we’re in the same room, voice notes that carry our hearts, or letters that spill out all the feelings.

About me: I’m a dreamer who loves walks while holding hands, hiking, and those conversations that make you feel alive. Fall’s my season—crisp air, bonfires, and that golden light just do something to me. I want a woman who’s as passionate as I am, who loves the little things and isn’t afraid to dive deep into love with open communication and trust. Polyamory to me is about building something honest and beautiful, and I’m ready to pour my heart into it.

We broke up earlier this year. I’m avoidant, she’s anxious. Two months before the breakup she almost ended things, but we worked through it. Two months later she ended it for real. Her reason: she felt emotionally dependent on me, couldn’t go more than a few days without seeing me, and needed space to figure herself out.

It was a respectful breakup no drama, just love and best wishes. I gave her the space she wanted, cut contact, and focused on myself. Since then I’ve been to therapy, learned about our attachment styles, crushed it at work, and traveled a lot. I’ve grown a ton.

Four months after the breakup she reached out to return a few of my things. I kept it short: just grabbed my stuff, no small talk. Recently, I’ve noticed little signals that make me wonder if she still feels something.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I was thrown out and asked never to return, and say nothing of this incident.

1nsq4gi,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheInfection/comments/1nsq4gi/practical_explanation_about_next_life_and_purpose/,"Practical explanation about next life, and Purpose of life","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

So I find myself shrinking in these situations. This is bad because my job requires the opposite.

- I’m in a new city and have been introduced to some people via existing contacts. But I would also like to do some cold outreach for people for coffee who are in my industry.

Gambling is bad. I know, big surprise, but it may be a nice thing to establish before properly beginning. Gambling is bad and dumb. And while there isn’t anything inherently wrong with “spicing” up a game by putting some money on the table, the quick emotions can for many end up becoming a problem, one that an entire industry is all too happy to exploit. [There are, in fact, studies that show that casinos and betting shops quite often explicitly prey on disadvantaged people.](https://archive.ph/lVgQR) But of course, that’s already vox populi, you don’t need me to tell you that (unless you do, in which case it would be nice to get in contact with a therapist specialized in addictions, seek help, it’s never too late.)

Then again, lotteries aren’t exactly gambling. Okay, yes, sure, it is by all definitions, playing the lottery is absolutely gambling, but there’s a difference betweeen something as ludic as can be playing slots, or pachinko or poker, and paying the pity amount of 1€ in Septmember to your aunt only to find out that you’re now a multimillionaire by Christmas, and so is she.

Now, to you the people of the Anglosphere, and of pretty much anywhere in the world, that might sound a little bit strange, as your usual image of the lottery and lottery players tend to be people who are rather trashy or desperate to get out of whatever dump they are and do it religiously at least once a week, simply giving their money away to corporations for a very low chance at stopping to struggle. Most places didn’t have a literal fascist minister imprinting t-shirts with the inmortal statement “Spain is different” in them.

**The Big One.**

The Sorteo Extraordinario de Navidad, or the Extraordinary Christmas Lottery, has been going for over a two hundred years, ever since it started in 1812 as a fundraising effort by the regency government during the efforts to fight against the Napoleonic armies in a way that wouldn’t put excessive pressure on the already strained personal economics of the population of a war-torn country.

It is also the highest paying in the world by total pool. We’re talking about a few billions each time with the winner getting an amount in the ballpark of 700 million euros, usually more.

Of course, that would be if it there was only winner, but the Spanish lottery works in a rather particular way. [In the words of the 99% invisible podcast,](https://web.archive.org/web/20250413193950/https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/el-gordo/) which goes into far more detail about the lottery itself and its societal impact than I will:

>The government thought [sic] if the they set the price of tickets high, only rich people would buy them. But that’s not what happened. People began “syndicate” playing, or playing in groups. (…) It’s very expensive to own an entire number, so organizations will buy a share of a number and then sell off even smaller shares to individuals — five euro shares, two euro shares, etc. Thousands of people may own small fractions of the same number. 

Organizations here can mean either your family, that pub on the corner of the steets that you often go to have breakfast in, the office you go to do your 9-to-5 in or maybe some local association that sold the shares of the ticket as fundraising efforts. This combined with the fact that the different parts of a given Number always sell in the same place is one of the various factors that contributed not only to the thorough normalization of the Christmas lottery and it being seen as a tradition that pretty much everyone engages in, but it directly impacted the way the whole thing is sold.

Because, despite this lottery being a highly interesting thing from a sociological standpoint, and having a lot of little cultural tidbits, playing it doesn’t count as a hobby.  No, there are no lottery nerds out there.^^1 There are, however, advertisement nerds, people who have made studying that whole thing into their thing, and that’s what I want to talk about in this writeup.

This is about the notable advertisements for the Spanish Christmas Lottery, and their impact in pop culture. More specifically, I will be talking about the Bald Guy period (1998-2005) and the ones that were a bit in the cultural zeitgeist of their time, the advertisements from 2013 to 2015. Which might sound, again, a bit strange, but as it happens, the three have a bit of a look into what was going on inside the country’s collective mind at the time.

**Christmas is about three things, Jesus, Santa Claus, and that bald dude, in that order.**

[His name is Clive Arrindell,](https://archive.ph/RYQkV) he was born in Trinidad and Tobago in 1950, he’s a Shakesperean actor and he isn’t, in fact, bald. However he had shaved his head for another role when he did the auditions for the ads and ended up being known as the bald guy.

All the advertisements from his period are pretty much interchangeable.

For comparison: [1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLSVroROOQ4) and [2003.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU4on90mOb8)

There are scenes of the life on an industrious city, going all over it as the bald man, decked in a black long coat, walks through it, many times seemingly unnoticed, often apparently having magical powers. All of it in black and white, all with a direction that evokes films from the late silent era, both in fashions and general styles. In the background plays a vals taken from the soundtrack of Doctor Zhivago.^^2 The advertisements end with him looking briefly at the camera and the voice of a narrator coming in to say:

>This Christmas, your dreams play the lottery. May luck be with you.

However, in 2006, precisely due to him having become inmensely popular, he got fired from the role. [According to a spokesman from the Statal Society of Lotteries and Gambling](https://archive.ph/AXVBi) (the publicly-owned corporation that issues the Christmas Lottery):

>The bald man has cannibalized the campaigns and what was behind goes unnoticed.

The advertisements of this period, despite how trivial they may seem, not only were highly popular - [in an article about Arridell’s firing at the time](https://archive.ph/9sciQ), TheGuardian claims that sales of lottery tickets during his time had gone up by 11% *a year* - but they ended up being highly regarded retroactively by none other than the millenial generation, as those who are now pushing 40 were reaching puberty in that time and actually becoming aware of their surroundings, which led to them being seen with large amounts of nostalgia. An article of the time also claims that there was significant controversy on the internet about the firing, but those were forum threads and blogs from 20 years ago, and thus most went the way of the Telegony.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After that, the advertisements became mostly normal, we’d maybe get one centering on people just hanging out while a narrator goes on about how everything is a bit better in Christmas, or elaborate slightly surreal art pieces like the *The Factory of Dreams* duology in 2011 and 2012, which looked far more like a stereotypical perfume ad than having the christmassy ambience of all of the previous ones. So, after that, the lottery company decided to go with a completely different approach, one that would be about “the core meaning of Christmas”…

And well...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**2013 – Here’s ~~Johnny~~ Christmas! .**

Pedraza is a tiny village in the province of Segovia, with less than 400 inhabitants by the latest census. It also has a castle, fortified walls, [it was declared a protected site in the 1950s and since 2014 it is considered to be one of the most beautiful villages in Spain.](https://archive.ph/uQ0bn) Thus, it has been the place for a non-insignificant amount of filming, ranging from silent movies, to historical dramas, to one of the “surruralist” fims of José Luis Cuerda^^3, and even an HBO Lovecraft-lite horror show.

In 2013, it was the set chosen for [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTgdG9jWxX8) Viewer discretion is advised.

So, I case anyone was a bit in shock or is reading this writeup in a place where they can’t just play a Youtube video, here’s a brief description of that:
After some shots of the empty but decorated streets of the village, a child holding a candle runs in and we get full music video with a giant golden Christmas tree starring opera singer Monserrat Caballé, famous for her opera singing (duh) and [that song she made with Freddy Mercury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1fiOJDXA-E), the songwriter and singer Raphael, famous for *not* being an anthropomorphic mutant weeaboo reptile, pop ballad singers David Bustamante and Marta Sánchez, and flamenco singer Niña Pastori. All interspersed with shots of a happy and loving audience that, I haven’t done a headcount, for the record, but seem to be more than the village’s entire population. They’re singing about the beauty of Christmas, and well, the lottery itself.

Now, you, the reader who has seen the video might have noticed that it can come out as being a bit… creepy. Creepy at best, there are some who back then found it straight up terrifying, from the barking of dogs over the empty village, all the silence before the song starts, the whole thing about a single running child, and well… Caballé herself, who seems to show her teeth a bit too much.

Comparisons abounded back then with a cult meeting, a mass-sacrifice to the Elder Gods, a weird nightmare, and so on. Or in the words of the first comment I saw in the video when I scrolled down for just a bit while the song played:

>Happy tenth anniversary to this famous Halloween advertisement!

It was so bad, that [Caballé ended up critiziting it:](https://archive.ph/Lxggj)

>Can’t you see it? It’s horrid.

[It shouldn’t come up as much of a surprise, that it was extensively meme’d](https://www.laopiniondemalaga.es/sociedad/2013/11/19/loteria-navidad-terrorifica-28681695.html) For the record, my favourite is the first one in that list, it was my favourite then, and it hasn’t aged at all. It was, arguably, the first of the Christmas lottery campaigns that managed to reach internet virality, and that set a bit of a trend to keep seeking it, although, given the criticism, the next year they decided to go on a completely different route.

**2014 - A sense of community.**

Spain wasn’t a very nice place to be in 2014. 

The 2008 economic crash, mishandling of the following crisis and the advent of Austerity policies with a change in government towards a conservative administration ended up causing a large amount of societal upheavals. There were massive demonstrations, country-wide strikes, and among a middle class that had essentially disappeared overnight and a working class that was reaching the lines of poverty things were reaching the point of grassroots political platforms, organizations and parties that were far to both sides of the until then usual bipartidism.

So, the ad was quite a bit different.

A website named “ElBardeAntonio” was made containing 9 shorts focused on stories aound a small neighborhood bar (A Spanish bar, by the way, is a lot closer to an English pub than the usual Anglospheric concept of one.), the kind that everyone has nearby.^^4 Along with a place where people could write down their own stories about their neightborhood’s or village’s bar. Unfortunately pretty much all of them have been lost to time, as the site is down and the Wayback machine barely archived its skeleton, so I won’t link it. But the main TV-aired advertisement [still exists](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei-_M_3aTyI)

A man, Manuel, is told by (presumably) his wife to go down to the bar, where most of the usual patrons, except for him, have bought a winning ticket. Manuel is reluctant but finally agrees to go, if only to be with the community. Once there, upon greeting the owner, who runs it, he turns down an offer for a drink and just orders some coffee, only to be told that it’d be 21€. He mutters a weak sarcastic response before the owner, Antonio (of the dead website’s fame), explains that it’s 1€ for the coffee and 20€ for the ticket that he kept for him. The ad ends with him in tears, excitedly explaining what just happened to a reporter who is covering the party, and a new slogan for the lottery:

>The biggest prize is sharing it.

Unlike the previous one (for obvious reasons), the 2014 advert was acclaimed. It was regarded as a heartwarming little story, in fact I remember at the time, when it was still in public discussion, hearing people claim that they straight up cried watching it for the first time, which is normal. In those times, one of the few things that could unite the country was solidarity, and the actors said as much [in an interview:](https://archive.ph/cue1r)

>We Spaniards are more generous than what it might seem at first sight. You just have to look at the National Organization of Transplants, the sludge that thousands went to clean up when the *Prestige*^^5 happened or being the first in the world in missionaries and NGO volunteers.

That said, some did criticize it as being unrealistic, assuming that someone in Antonio’s position would just shut up and keep the money, with the actor saying as much. That said,  [the story actually happened in real life the previous year](https://archive.ph/sF5om) so… varying mileages and all that. 

On a different kind of public reception, the advertisement ended up being meme’d to death, with constant edits putting different things inside the envelope or having Antonio never give it to Juan, or replacing them with politicians. It ended up so thoroughly beaten down that one of the skits on TVE’s (that’s Spain’s publicly owned broadcaster, think the BBC but without TV loicenses) New Years Eve comedy special had “this is the 987th parody of this ad” as the punchline.

[The next year, a short film was made with the original actors that explained what happened *after* they won the lottery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zHKe_EfRFU) Antonio reluctantly closed his bar, Manuel broke up with his wife because he found her annoying, and then they both blew everything on yatches, alcohol and prostitution. Manuel then died in an accident involving crossdressers and monkeys and his wife ended up institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital, where Antonio is delivering a vase with the ashes. Of course, Loterias del Estado had nothing to do with that, but I think it’s worth mentioning it.

**2015 - Justino.**

After the great reception of the previous year, it was decided to go in the same route, telling a small story of everyday people, one that would be as hearwarming and they kept the same motto about sharing. But this time, it was for the first and only time, animated.

[They made this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HsZh4Fkb4A)

The advert is about one Justino, a middle aged mustachioed man who works as the night watchman in a mannequin factory. Trying to starve away the boredom of his job with the mannequins, Justino decides to begin doing nice things for those who work there during the day, such as positioning a mannequin offering cake for one in her birthday, or placing them in amusing positions. This endears the other workers to him, who would otherwise be invisible. Eventually, the daytime workers win the lottery and keep an extra ticket, for him who finds them throwing him a surprise party that very night.

The reception to it was pretty much what they wanted, being regarded as heartwarming and a bit sad in what matters to Justino himself, [as the director of the marketing agency that made the short](https://archive.ph/Vcers) said:

>In the narrative sense, it is very important for characters to have some kind of want, and as such, we looked for a character who for whatever reason couldn’t just share with others.

[It also won 48 awards.](https://archive.ph/St2l7) Which is a bit, well, I didn’t know there were so many awards for marketing to be honest, but then again, there is such a thing as [Miss Cow](https://archive.ph/jVJbB) in Spain^^6 , so what the hell do I know?

**The Post-Justino times.**

The next year the adverstisement centered around a lonely old woman. It was very dramatic and a little hearwarming story, this time in live action. Although it did had a bit of a problem… It was the third like that. And well, nobody cared much about it, it was widely regarded as sentimental slop. The next year, seeing the criticism, Loterías tried to go for something more lighthearted, specifically a mostly comedic story about a man trapped in a time loop.

It didn’t stick either. They’d try again, and again, changing genres, trying to get that little viral sensation of those big three, but nothing stuck, then COVID struck, and then for the next few years, the ads began to feel more like PSAs than what they once were, and were no longer in the public conversation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**So, times changed.**

When I wrote the original first draft of this writeup, which was around two paragraphs long before being deleted, I began waxing poetic about the importance of the invisible  ephemera in the public consciousness, about things that we never really notice and exist for an extremely limited time. Because despite us maybe not being aware of them even after their disappearance, they may leave their mark in our minds and end up as a subject of nostalgia. There are still elderly people who remember brands that they never consumed, but are aware of the exact place it was in the little shop at the corner of a street 50 years ago. And the same happens to a lot of advertisements, we see them, we complaint in case they suck or if there are too many one after each other, but in the end, those little shits that want out money, may end up having a place in out minds, as long as they’re well made.

So, a little Where are they Now may be in order:

Clive Arrindell returned to England, where he was raised and lives, and he has participated in theater, but not much. He managed to get a million euros after his firing because he was entitled to what remained of his contract, for three more years. He did, however, return as the Bald Guy in two advertisements that were not about the lottery. One in 2013 for the NGO Action against Hunger, talking about the numbers that ‘truly matter’, specifically the then 8.500 children who died all over the world from malnutrition. And another far more lighthearted one in 2017, in which he caused a storm of shrimp by caressing his magical moustache. [I’m not joking.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxdvQxKu84Q) It was made for a frozen seafood company.

Monserrat Caballé, who at the time of the advert was fighting cancer, passed away five years later, not from cancer. Raphael, however, was diagnosed of brain cancer last year. He’s still alive at the time of writing and hasn’t retired yet. 

The other singers are still doing their thing, singing, [although Bustamante did go boxing against a Youtuber and lost.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qH4rvAJ7Xqg)

Justino, ten years later, is probably still working in the factory, I guess, he didn’t look old enough to retire, but again, dude looked like Super Mario’s weird uncle, so who knows?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Well, last I promised niche, so here’s niche. Also, here are a few footnotes, because going on asides all the time for fun facts or just explanations to references that take more than one line can be a bit messy to read through:

**1-** There are, in fact, lottery nerds. I only found out about it when researching about this, but there are people who do a lot of statistics and keep records about the lottery and the many stories around it.

**2-** Doctor Zhivago, as it happens, was largely filmed in Spain.

**3-** José Luis Cuerda was a film director who among many other films made a trilogy of surreal comedy movies that were set in rural locales. They’re *Total*, *Dawn breaks, which is no small thing,* and *In Heaven as it is on Earth.* The second one is regarded as a classic of Spanish cinema and the first is a little known cult classic. The third one was the one filmed in Pedraza.

**4-** As it happens, Spain has the highest numbers of bars per capita in the world. With 1 every 175 inhabitants, at least according to the National Institute of Statistics.

**5-** The *Prestige* was an oil tanker that sunk near the coast of Galicia in northern Spain in 2002, letting out over 50.000 metric tons of oil that heavily polluted both the ocean and the nearby beaches. Over 100.000 people from all over Spain and a lesser amount from other countries temporarily relocated to Galicia to help with the cleaning efforts.

**6-** Yes, Miss Cow, or Miss Vaca in Spanish, is an actual thing organized by the Galician regional public television, and quite popular all across Spain, even if only online. And not a one-time-joke at that, next year it’ll be its 20th anniversary.

1nspulm,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1nspulm/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_stay_close_to_home/,AITA for asking my husband to stay close to home?,"My (30F) husband (36M) and I just had a baby, who is now 4 months old. While he’s generally a pretty cheerful little guy he is very clingy and not a great sleeper. With the exception of the first month or so, since he’s been born my husband has still managed to maintain a bit of a social life, going out for coffee with friends a couple times a week. This has been a bit of a point of contention all along because, although I do think it’s healthy to get out once in a while, he stays for hours (2-4 on average) and leaves me home with the baby, and if I ask him how long he thinks he’ll be he gets mad and says he doesn’t want to feel rushed. 

About a month ago I went back to work and for now he’s staying home with the baby until we get a spot in a daycare. We decided this would be the situation even before getting pregnant, as I like my job and he wanted to quit anyway, and it makes more sense financially. Since he’s been home he’s ramped up his evening coffees to 2-3 times in the week and at least one long daytime coffee break on the weekend. I honestly think this is crazy for a man with an infant at home. Plus he leaves the house messy, which I understand because it’s hard to clean with the baby, but it puts me in a position where I come home from a full work day and need to look after the baby and clean everything before sleeping. My husband does the cooking but never cleans after himself so I also have to clean that. He says it’s my problem because he doesn’t mind the mess, but I think if it’s not working for one of us it’s not working for either of us. 

Today I asked if he could take the baby for an hour so I could strip the paint from a table I want to sell. I don’t want the baby breathing in the fumes for obvious reasons. My husband said fine, he’d go visit his cousin who lives a 40 minute drive away. Based on past experiences if he goes he’ll be gone easily 4+ hours. I asked if he could just take him for a walk in the neighbourhood because i would only need an hour and I miss my baby during the week and don’t want to miss an entire day with him on the weekend. He got extremely annoyed and said he’s a prisoner in the neighborhood and not even allowed to go see his friends. I don’t understand why he couldn’t go see this cousin during the week when I’m at work (the cousin works a job where he has a pretty flexible schedule). 

My husband thinks I’m basically suffocating him I suppose. I think going out 3-4 times a week for multiple hours for coffee with an infant at home is unreasonable. I think part of it is cultural, he comes from a very traditional culture where the women are responsible for the kids and the men do what they want. But I made it clear I was not interested in that kind of family before we even got married let alone started talking about kids.

My two year old son is a smart and sweet little guy but he is mischievous. He’s so full of energy and is in the height of his temper tantrums. Conveniently he only ever does what he’s not supposed to. I’ve been horribly depressed this pregnancy and often feel little emotion. I work full time nights so during the day I’m a lot like a SAHM. I do the cooking and cleaning or else it won’t get done. I’m just, so effing exhausted. My own temper has been skyrocketing lately. 

Today, for the third time in 24hrs, my son dumped over the trash. He doesn’t learn that this isn’t okay and continues to do it. This time it spilled old food and coffee all over the floor. I screamed at my son, causing him to cry and I feel horrible. I just don’t know what to do. There’s no keeping him happy, he’s constantly throwing fits, and won’t sit still at all. I’m just so frustrated and feel like I’m failing. I’m terrified of adding a second when I’m barely holding on to my sanity with one. Anyone else struggling this much with their toddler?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1nspn9k,https://www.reddit.com/r/EnhypenFanPage/comments/1nspn9k/i_wrote_a_fanfic/,I Wrote a fanfic.,"Sunghoon... DON'T COOK!

Fanfic by: Dabi

[Chapter 1 - Pisces]
Sunghoon wakes up early, 6 am, drinks iced coffee and goes to the stream to catch fish to prepare for lunch.
While Sunghoon does chores, Jungwon wakes up around 8 am and looks for something sweet to eat, he finds ice cream in the Freezer and eats the whole container.
Sunghoon comes home with a bunch of bighead fish and instant noodles to prepare “Ramen” for lunch.

[Chapter 2 - Oh shit Sunghoon!]
Sunghoon takes a large pot and throws everything he bought into it, puts boiling water on it and waits for it to cook well. Meanwhile, Jungwon just watches, and says:
- Hoonie, is that ramen?
And Sunghoon replied:
- Yes, I'll prepare it for us to eat.
- Is Jay coming? - asks Jungwon
- Yes - Sunghoon responds
The two remain silent for a while, and Sunghoon speaks:
- By the way... WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO GO HOME!? YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN LIVING HERE FOR 2 MONTHS DAMN IT!
- Well... In about 2 years I'll go back to my house - Jungwon responds with a wicked smile.

[Cap 3 - Jay, what the hell?]
They hear the sound of a motorcycle parking.
- It must be Jay - says Jungwon.
- Yes, that's good! Lunch is almost ready.
Jay enters and comes face to face with the boiling pot, sees the fish and shouts:
- SUNGHOON!!!!!!!!! WHAT THE FUCKING FISH IS THIS!?!?!?!? HE IS A BRAIN EATING FISH!!! CAN'T YOU SEE HE IS TRANSPARENT AND HEAD!?
- WHAT!? HE EAT BRAINS!? I FISHED THIS MORNING! And... I tasted it!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh shit.
Sunghoon faints.
- Jay! WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM TO A HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!!!!! - Jungwon shouts.
- Let's go with his car, get the keys quickly, I'll put him in the car! - Says Jay, trying to remain calm.

[Chap 4 - Hospital? Fuck]
Sunghoon wakes up in the hospital, with Jay and Jungwon sitting by his side.
- Guys? What are we doing here?
- Well... you ingested a fish with a brain-eating worm, but luckily Dr. Chan managed to remove it in time. - Jay replies.
- Thank God... Now... bring me an ice cream Jungwon?

- Leave it to me haha! - says Jungwon
And so the tragic story of the brain-eating fish ends.

[Chap 5 – Brain? Where?]
Jay adjusts his jacket, still trying to believe what he saw.
Suddenly, Dr. Chan enters the room, with a strange expression.
– So... we have a problem – says the doctor, scratching the back of his head.
– WHAT AGAIN!? – Jay gets up from the chair, already prepared for the worst.
– The worm... he wasn't just a worm. It was an AUXILIARY BRAIN.
– AUXILIARY BRAIN??? – shouts Jungwon, spitting half of the ice cream on the floor.
The doctor takes a deep breath and continues:
– When I removed it, the organism divided. One piece is here in the laboratory... and the other... - NO, DON'T TELL ME! – Jay covers his ears, but listens anyway.
– ...the other could be... in your digestive system.
Silence.
Sunghoon opens his eyes slowly, pale:
– ...so... the one who ate the most fish was... Jungwon, right?
– I ONLY EAT ICE CREAM, YOU ASSHOLE! – Jungwon jumps out of his chair.
Suddenly, an ominous noise echoes through the hallway.
*BLURB BLURB BLURB*
– T-th-that sound... it's not normal... – Jay says, shaking.
The door opens slowly. The transparent fish, now standing upright, with its brain worm pulsating, appears carrying a hospital tray:
– YOU FORGOT ABOUT ME...

[Chap 6 – Peixonimostos Reborn]
The transparent fish enters the room, with the tray shaking on its deformed fin.
– DO YOU WANT BRAIN SOUP? – he asks, his voice echoing like a broken microphone.
Jungwon throws the container of ice cream in the animal's face:
– GET OUT OF HERE, JELLY HEAD!
But the fish only licks the ice cream with the brain worm.
– HUM... SWEET. THIS WILL MAKE ME STRONGER.
Sunghoon, still groggy, looks and says:
– ...guys, I think I'm dreaming.
– YOU’RE NOT DREAMING, YOU CRAZY! – Jay shouts – THIS THING IS REALLY HERE!
The fish jumps to the ceiling and sticks like a spider, dripping transparent gooey water.
Suddenly, Dr. Chan appears again, now holding a defibrillator.
– Get away! I'm going to fry this sushi alive!
*BZZZZZT!*
The shock hits the fish, which begins to glow like a fluorescent lamp.
– HAHAHA! NOW I HAVE ELECTRIC POWER!
The hospital lights flicker. Several devices turn on by themselves, and the fish begins to control everything around.
Jay, trying to look brave, takes a deep breath:
– Okay... since no one is going to solve it, I'll finish it myself.
He picks up a stainless steel tray and looks at the fish.
– YOU MONSTER, YOU’RE NOT GOING TO GET ANYONE’S BRAIN TODAY!
The fish laughs with the worm pulsing:

– I WANT YOURS FIRST, JAY...

[Chap 7 – Jay vs Peixonimostos]
Jay holds the stainless steel tray as if it were a legendary sword.
– Your time has come, jellyfish head!
The fish falls from the ceiling, bouncing on the floor like jelly falling from a plate.
– I WILL TASTE YOUR IQ! – shouts the brain worm, trembling.
Jungwon, desperate, opens the hospital cabinet and finds... a giant syringe.
–Jay! Take that!
- What?
– AN “ANIME SYRINGE”! – Jungwon responds, throwing the object as if it were a shuriken. Jay catches it out of the air, spins the syringe and points it at the fish.
– Prepare for my final blow...
The fish advances at absurd speed, leaving a trail of electric goo down the corridor.
Jay spins the tray, bouncing off the fish's shocks like a shield.
– BRAIN… – shouts the fish.
– ...ON VACATION! – adds Jay, sticking the syringe straight into the brain worm.
*PLOFT!*
The fish freezes. His bulging eyes begin to spin, and he explodes in a spray of clear water that floods half the room.
Sunghoon, still lying down, raises his head:
– ...that means I’m not going to have ramen today, right?
– SHUT UP, SUNGHOON! – Jay and Jungwon shout together.
The entire hospital starts to shake. A voice echoes through the walls:
– YOU DEFEAT MY WEAKNESS FORM... BUT I STILL HAVE THE “KING FISH”!!!
The lights go out. At the end of the corridor, a gigantic fish-shaped shadow begins to appear...

[Chap 8 – The Arrival of the Peixonimostos King]
The lights flicker, the entire hospital shakes as if it's going to collapse.
Suddenly, the ceiling breaks and a colossal creature appears:
A giant transparent fish, with three deformed skulls, each with a pulsating brain worm. His eyes glowed fluorescent red.
– I AM THE PEIXONIMOSTOS KING! – the voice echoes, as if coming from inside everyone's mind. – …my God… – Jungwon whispers, dropping the empty ice cream container.
– Man... this thing is like the other Pokémon evolution! – Jay comments, trying to appear calm but shaking all over.
The Peixonimostos King opens his mouth and spits out a wave of smelly water, which crosses the corridor like a tsunami.
Sunghoon, even though he is still lying in bed, shouts:
– SOMEONE GET ME OUT OF HERE, I CAN’T SWIM!!!
Jay holds the tray tightly and says to the others:
– Listen, if we don't defeat this thing now, it's going to eat the brains of everyone in the hospital!
– And my first, because I’m smarter – adds Jungwon, full of himself.
– Shut up, Jungwon!
Suddenly, Dr. Chan appears again, now with a torn lab coat and a dark look.
– I knew... this day would come...
Jay looks confused:

- What? Did you know about the existence of a TRANSPARENT FISH WITH THREE BRAINS???
– Not only did you know… – Dr. Chan takes off his surgical mask and reveals a shiny scar on his forehead – …I am the true creator of the Peixonimostos Project.
Silence takes over.
Jungwon widens his eyes:
– So you're like... the mad scientist in the story?
– No. I am the hidden villain of the arc – Chan replies, while his eyes shine.
The King Fish roars so loudly that the glass in the windows shatters.
Jay takes a deep breath, raises the tray as if it were a sword and shouts:
– THEN IT’S TODAY… OR NEVER!

[Chap 9 – Peixonimostos Project]
The Peixonimostos King advances, crushing walls as if they were paper. Each of the three brain worms shouts a different thing:
- HUNGER!
– IQ!
- ICE CREAM!
- Ice cream?? – Jungwon widens his eyes – This worm copied me!
Dr. Chan laughs insanely.
– You don't understand! The Peixonimostos Project was created to evolve human beings! Brain + fish = perfect species!
– FUCKING PERFECT SPECIES! – Jay counters – You just created an ugly, slimy, brain-eating fish!
Chan ignores it and holds up a capsule filled with blue liquid.
– This is the ultimate essence! If I inject it into him, the Peixonimostos King will be invincible!
Sunghoon, still lying down but with sudden strength, throws a pillow in Chan's face.
– Shut up, shitty little doctor!
The capsule falls to the ground and rolls to Jay's feet.
–Jay! – shouts Jungwon – It’s your chance!
Jay takes the capsule, looks at the Peixonimostos King and says:
– Then let's see if you can handle your own weapon.
He runs down the flooded hallway, leaps into the air, and shoves the capsule straight into the fish's open mouth.
*BLURB BLURB BLURB!!!*
Peixonimostos' body begins to shake. The brain worms wrap themselves around each other, their eyes glow brighter and the creature begins to inflate like a balloon about to burst.
Chan, desperate:
- NO!!! YOU WILL DESTROY MY CREATION!!!
Jay falls to the floor, panting.
– Either we finish him off now... or we're all going to blow up.
The entire hospital starts to shake harder. The Peixonimostos King opens its three mouths and shouts in unison:
– CÉÉÉÉÉREBROOOOOOOOOOOOOOS!!!

[Chapter 10 – The Last Sip of Ice Cream]
The entire hospital vibrates like it's going to explode. The King Fish inflates more and more, the brain worms twitch screaming:
- HUNGER! IQ! ICE CREAM!
Jay looks at the others and says seriously:
– If we stay here, we’re done.

Chan, desperate, tries to run to the fish:
– MY CREATION CANNOT DIE LIKE THIS!!!
But before he gets close, Jungwon trips him.
– Xiu, little doctor! This isn't Dragon Ball, it's crazy fanfic!
Suddenly, the fish begins to crack, the blue light from the capsule shining inside it.
Jay raises the tray like a sword and shouts:
– YOUR TIME HAS COME, FISH!
With an epic leap worthy of an anime protagonist, Jay drives the tray straight into the transparent skull.
*CRAAAACK!*
The Peixonimostos King explodes in a giant jet of gooey water, which invades the entire hospital. Everyone is dragged down the hall, screaming.
When the water recedes, there is only silence. The hospital is destroyed.
Jay, Sunghoon and Jungwon are lying on the floor, soaking wet.
Sunghoon, coughing:
– ...I just wanted to eat ramen...
Suddenly, among the rubble, an object appears floating... a tub of ice cream.
Jungwon takes the pot and smiles:
– In the end, the real hero was always the ice cream.
Jay puts his hand on his forehead, laughing nervously:
– This was, by far, the worst morning of my life.
They start to walk out of the ruined hospital, when a faint voice echoes from inside:
– ...you forgot me...
It was Dr. Chan, trapped on a broken stretcher.
But before anyone can respond, a bird lands on his head and... shits.

 End.

1nspm21,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1nspm21/wife_initiated_separation_but_lots_of/,"Wife initiated separation but lots of communication, hanging out.","
My wife (36F) and I (42M) have been together for 12 years, married for 2. We have a 7-year-old daughter and a 3-year-old son.

On August 4 she initiated a separation, saying I had been emotionally abusive and manipulative in our relationship. At the time I agreed and apologized. I even offered options — taking equity out of the house so she could get her own place, or me leaving to stay with my parents. She said no to both, citing the kids, holidays, and “timing not being right.”

Since then, I’ve been going to therapy weekly (my own choice, not because she asked) and working on myself.

Here’s where it gets confusing:
	•	I’ve been sleeping on the couch since the separation.
	•	She took down our wedding picture and unlinked me from social media — I’m basically invisible publicly, while I notice she posts more “attention-seeking” stuff on TikTok.
	•	At the same time, she initiates most of our calls/texts and invites me to hang out — concerts, lunches, breakfasts, and family activities with the kids.
	•	Most of the family time we’ve had in the last month has been initiated by her.
	•	I’ve been paying for everything (concerts, meals, outings).

Mixed signals:
	•	At a concert she asked me to, there was a moment where the band told everyone to hold their partner. I tried to, but she pushed my hands down. The next day she posted pics/videos like she had gone alone.
	•	Later she brought that concert moment up, saying she hadn’t really “invited” me — she just thought I liked the band. I got annoyed because I paid for everything, and I wasn’t sure what terms she thought we were going on. (It was supposed to be just us, then she invited my brother and his wife last minute.)
	•	I found a saved flirty emoji/sticker on her phone at one point. No proof she used it, but it made me question things.
	•	I also found a workout live photo of her shaking her butt at the gym. Again, no evidence she sent it, but it looked provocative.
	•	Despite all this daily closeness, I’m still erased on social media and not sleeping in the same bed.

Other dynamics:
	•	Yesterday she went to my brother’s wife’s birthday. I stayed home with the kids. She came back buzzed but not drunk. I had fallen asleep with my son in bed. She asked if I was staying there. I told her I was just putting him to sleep but could move to the couch. She asked why I wanted off the couch, and I explained honestly that it’s uncomfortable, cold, and noisy. She gave in and let me sleep in bed.
	•	Around the house, I’ve really stepped up — I do the dishes, trash, gas up her car, wash it, restock her makeup, handle laundry for her and the kids, etc.
• we now take the kids to school together 4/5 days. A lot of these days after she asks me to hangout. Get coffee, get breakfast. 

• she started taking a course to medical code btw that’s her plan to leave the house. But she doesn’t really prioritize studying as much as I thought she would. 

• I Zelle her $700 a week a lot more than child support would be. Not sure if I should stop that. 

Where I’m at emotionally:
	•	She spends tons of time with me, but keeps me invisible publicly.
	•	She still shares her location with me and I haven’t found anything on her phone suggesting another guy.
	•	I don’t know if she’s genuinely testing the waters of reconciliation or if she’s keeping me close for comfort until she’s ready to move on.

I feel like I’m in limbo. I don’t know if I’m fooling myself or if this is what early reconciliation looks like.

Has anyone been through this? How do you cope with being so present in daily life but erased publicly. ",3,1759069406.0,Separation,4,1.0,False

I have always been a bit of an introverted loner, but these last few months have made me realise that I am no longer just mostly alone, but that I’m actually lonely. I’m hoping this post here can be a bit of a kick-start to my social life. I’m not picky about how, whether it be real-life friends, virtual friends, texting buddies; I’m open for pretty much anything! I want to get off that autopilot life, so I’m looking for someone to share my thoughts and experiences with, and who wants to share their thoughts and experiences with me. Let’s ask each other meaningful or meaningless questions. Let’s talk about random crap, or about important things. Let’s share our life experiences, our passions, or what we’re having for dinner. Let’s share photo’s of the world around us, and about our place in that world. I like to think of myself as curious, open-minded and inclusive, so please, broaden my horizons!

You don’t have to be into the same stuff as me, but I’ll share a bit about myself just so that you know who you’d be talking to. I used to prefer coffee over tea, but am slowly starting to prefer tea. I thoroughly enjoy living in a city, but my ideal vacation is travelling to remote places and spending my days hiking or biking. I prefer paperbacks over hardcover books. I love muddling around in the kitchen. I own more watches than any sane person should. I’m a former fit person who got fat, and is trying (but so far failing) to get fit again. Having said all that, I've just started a postgraduate course through work, so most of my evenings for the foreseeable future will probably be spent studying😅

I have struggled massively with my mental health, and even though things are much better now, I continue to be in therapy. I’m just sharing this because I think it’s good to acknowledge the things I struggle with, and to show that I’m open-minded concerning personal battles.

Are there dairy free creams that actually taste good in coffee, and can be frothed? I loved the creaminess of half and half.",0,1759069241.0,dairyfree,4,0.4,False

So I ordered an affogato that costs Php 220. The margarita glass containing the ice cream was balanced on top
Of a flat saucer. When I accidentally moved the saucer, the glass tipped over and broke  when it landed ON THE TABLE (not even on the floor). Can you just imagine how poor of a product for it to break into pieces just like that?

So anyway, the wait staff didn’t even assist us when they saw the glass broke. We had to call their attention. They didn’t even offer to replace my affogato!!! 

When we were about to pay the manager was adamant about paying for the broken glass. Naturally since we were kind of embarrassed  we said ok. But since my sister was paying, she couldn’t believe the manager was charging Php 500 for a breakage fee which was MORE THAN TWICE AS EXPENSIVE AS THE ORDER.

Anyway, we got mad and raised the concern. I even asked for the company policy which lists what items would count for a breakage fee. As soon as I raised my voice and threatened to report this as a violation of the Consumer act, the manager quickly canceled it.

TBh, if they were kind of to replace the affogato and had been more accommodating, I would’ve paid for it. Or at least gave a larger tip to cover the cost of the glass WHICH WAS OBVIOUSLY NOT WORTH PHP 500. 

I’ve eaten at multiple restaurants and I occasionally had some instances that the glass topples over and breaks but this is the first time I was charged for something like this!!! What’s more surprising this is a multinational franchise! I don’t think I’ll ever go back to this branch 🗝️☕️

So Am I overreacting?

Learn more about our flexible approach to where we work.
**Overview**
**_About the Role_**
We’re hiring a Senior MarTech Platform Strategist to lead the strategy, prioritization, and execution of Instacart’s Paid Marketing infrastructure.
As a MarTech Platform Strategist, you’ll define the vision and roadmap for Paid MarTech — from what we build vs. buy, to how systems integrate with Ads, CRM, and Off-Platform marketing channels. You’ll be responsible for identifying the highest-leverage investments, aligning teams around clear priorities, and ensuring systems are scalable, observable, and modular by design.
This is a 75% product strategy / 25% marketing intuition role — ideal for someone with deep fluency in how paid media platforms actually work, paired with strong technical instincts and product leadership experience. You’ll be the connective tissue across marketing and engineering teams — translating campaign needs into platform architecture, and helping Instacart scale performance with precision.
**_About the Team_**
This role sits within our Marketing Enablement & Technology (MET) org, where you’ll work closely with a dedicated engineering team to build the systems that power paid acquisition across Meta, Google, TikTok, affiliate, and emerging platforms. You’ll own infrastructure spanning audience tooling, event tracking, conversion APIs, and/or platform integrations — delivering the foundation for faster, smarter, and more measurable campaign execution.
**About the Job**
  * Own and evolve the product strategy for Paid MarTech tooling — across systems like signal maturity, audience delivery, tagging architecture, and event ingestion.
  * Partner with engineering to define technical implementation plans and optimize for long-term scale, reuse, and velocity.
  * Make build vs. buy decisions based on impact, effort, integration complexity, and ROI — guiding vendor evaluations and onboarding processes.
  * Actively identify gaps in campaign workflow, system reliability, and measurement coverage — then drive clarity around what should be fixed, when, and why.
  * Collaborate with marketing leaders to deeply understand their objectives, workflows, and blockers — ensuring the infrastructure roadmap reflects real campaign needs.
  * Work cross-functionally with product and engineering leads across Ads, CRM, Lifecycle, and Data to align on dependencies, roadmap sequencing, and shared platform evolution.
  * Champion roadmap discipline — prioritizing ruthlessly, communicating clearly, and aligning stakeholders on tradeoffs and outcomes.


**About You**
**_Minimum Qualifications_**
  * 7–12+ years of experience in product, growth infrastructure, MarTech, or marketing systems strategy roles.
  * Deep domain fluency in paid marketing operations — including attribution frameworks, campaign optimization, and how signal quality impacts platform performance.
  * Experience leading large cross-functional efforts with stakeholders across Engineering, Data Science, Product, and Marketing.
  * Strong intuition for how to balance user needs, technical feasibility, and organizational readiness in complex system planning.
  * A systems-first mindset, with an appreciation for modularity, observability, and scaling infrastructure for the next 10x growth phase.
  * Comfort working in ambiguous or early-stage environments — bringing structure where needed, guiding teams through uncertainty, and helping establish scalable foundations from scratch.
  * Technical fluency with a relevant subset of modern Paid MarTech systems and tools — for example:
    * Event and tracking infrastructure: Meta CAPI, TikTok Events API, MMPs (e.g. Branch), Firebase, GA4
    * Data and orchestration systems: Airflow DAGs, DBT modeling, event validation tools, schema QA frameworks
    * Audience management and CDP platforms: LiveRamp, Segment, mParticle, Adobe Experience Platform
    * Feed management tooling: Productsup, Feedonomics, VersaFeed, Google Merchant Center


**_Preferred Qualifications_**
  * Experience shaping marketing infrastructure at scaled consumer tech or eCommerce companies.
  * Working knowledge of attribution methods (MMM, MTA, Etc).
  * Background in data governance and privacy-first marketing (ie GDPR, CCPA, ATT).
  * Ability to influence technical architecture without writing production code.
  * Experience with experimentation frameworks (holdouts, geo-experiments).
  * Strong communication and storytelling skills for executive audiences.
  * Curiosity about emerging ad platforms, measurement standards, and AI-driven campaign orchestration.

1nspimw,https://www.reddit.com/r/existentialcomics/comments/1nspimw/purpose_of_life_and_practical_application_about/,"Purpose of life, and Practical application about reincarnation","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1759069166.0,existentialcomics,0,1.0,False

1nspi4j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mediums/comments/1nspi4j/mediums_keep_mentioning_me_to_family_members/,Mediums keep mentioning me to family members - advice?,"The women in my family tend to have some kind of ability to see/feel/sense spirits, and many of us read tarot (myself included). My grandmother and mother both see mediums, and my grandmother recently went to see an allegedly well-known medium with her sister. She called me this morning to tell me about it because the medium repeatedly asked to speak to someone with my name (and listed off some other relevant details that lead my grandmother to think he was referring to me). My grandma is shy and didn't go up for a reading, but this is now the third or fourth time in recent years that she or my mother have called to tell me the medium asked about/for me. I am very low-contact with my mother, but have a good relationship with my grandmother, though we don't speak that often.

  
Now, out of everyone in my family, I am definitely the most comfortable with experimenting with and learning more about these abilities. I also work with the dead (I study and try to identify skeletal remains, and I volunteer with folks searching for unmarked burials), and have a series of rituals and practices to do that work. I make coffee for my ancestors every morning, I have a visualisation practice I use to ground, shield, and connect myself, and I have some other similar assorted practices to help with all the dead folks I encounter physically and spiritually. I also read my own cards (I know people have differing opinions on this, however, it is helpful for me) and typically they give me very accurate advice and (sometimes) predictions. With all these mediums mentioning me and my family reaching out as a result, should I be going to see a medium? Is it possible for me to get whatever message they're trying to send on my own? Or is it possible I'm just more ""visible"" to mediums my family goes to see because of my work with the dead? Thanks so much for any insights.",2,1759069129.0,Mediums,0,1.0,False
