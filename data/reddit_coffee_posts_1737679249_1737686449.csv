Is there alternatives? Thanks!,"So appreciate anyone who reads this through all the way. Let me say this first, I've tried going to link checker sites and several said that it was unwanted content and they won't even check the links. That's kinda what  made me stop and be like ""wut?"" I thought maybe these url checker sites could tell me what is on there so that I know.

But the reason  I'm asking is because... it didn't really bother me so much because these pages are on Facebook openly sitting there so I found it strange but not really too strange however my man seems to like these pages a lot and I always just found it weird. 

But basically I've always found it weird how my man (who I know in real life, I went to school with them,) has all these accounts he follows openly but they are sites leading to suspicious links. And I've always been ultra curious as to what they are but I'm not entirely sure. Like one page is actually a page dedicated  to some sport but it has a site that I've never heard of and a . mp4 attached to every one of the posts.

In other profiles, they are all random women and from first glance, you think it's a profile of an actual person because at first, it seems to be set up that way.  There will be one or two posts of the girl in the photo drinking coffee or saying something personal but the more you scroll, the more it changes women and they look different until you just realize that they're actually all different women. 

One link I ran just now actually just did a malware check on the link to the sport account that had the . mp4 attached to it but not a preview (the ones that have previews refuse to show these links,) but it came back flagged as highly suspicious on just the ones that checked for malware. 

But I mean, in order for my man to follow these accounts... he'd have to click on the links right? But if the links contain malware... then why is he following these people",1,1737686288.0,computers,0,1.0,False

1i8l13g,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1i8l13g/why_am_i_still_having_joint_pain/,Why am I still having joint pain?,"34F, white, hetero, 5'6, 130lbs. Don't smoke, haven't had alcohol in over 5 years - due to mininimal tolerance issues and anxiety. Had a daughter in 2022.

Prior existing conditions before: anxiety & depression
Medications: Zoloft 50mg from 2019-early 2022, intermittent vitamins and Tylenol. 

Multiple different birth controls that didn't stick; worsened anxiety and depression. 
I stopped Zoloft during pregnancy.

In 2022 I welcomed my daughter into this world. During my pregnancy, I put on 80lbs, but had no issues other than constant terrible lower back pain. I've never put in this much weight in my life, kind of took me by surprise, but no indications of diabetes or thyroid issues. 
After the birth, it's like hell broke loose on my body. I had no appetite and felt like a shell. I was put in a high dose of naproxen to take 2x a day for a 3rd degree tear and incredible back pain.  

When my period started to try to come back (2 months in), my body went into this repeated shock state. I would wake up with a racing heart, throw up anything I ate or drank and just stay nausous most of the day. I would shake, cry and couldn't figure out wtf was going on. Checked thyroid and cortisol, had high cortisol but they linked that to postpartum anxiety. Saw a psychiatrist.

Eventually went on a myriad of antidepressants over the next year and a half to placate those symptoms:
- couldn't tolerate : busparone, dyciclomine, etc
1. Zoloft 50mg (2 months)
2. Effexor XR 37.5mg (4 months) + propranolol as needed 
3. Lamictal slow increase (2 months) - panic attacks that lasted hours
4. Lamotragine slow increase (3 months) - made me progressively more anxious and farigued

In March of 2023, I weaned off the last medication and felt great. In June I got really sick with something - I was throwing up bad again daily, constant nausea/stomach problems, developed a bad cough and pneumonia. I had a high fever for over a week - which has never happened to me before. We rotated Tylenol and Ibuprofen, did antibiotics etc. 

Since then, I've had rotating issues with my stomach and joints. I was diagnosed with SIBO in November and properly treated in January by the correct doctor with neomycin and rifaximin. For months I was dealing with constipation, morning nausea and vomiting spells, random joint pain flare ups, etc. 

Doctors I've seen:
Endocrinologist, rheumatologist, immunologist/allergist, primary, gynecologist and a gastroenterologist. 
All labs with Endo were normal (although in the beginning cortisol was high, then really low)
All labs with rheumatologist were normal - did notice indications of Raynaud's, shrugged off my symptoms to be SIBO related. I'll be following up with them soon. 
Original labs with immunology showed low iGb levels and ana positive. Retook the tests again 6 weeks after pneumovax and I was ana negative. 
Allergy panels came back negative for prick test 
Gastroenterologist treated the positive SIBO tests. 
We've tested for hypylori back in June and was positive, again in November and was negative. 

Functional doctor, we've tested hormones, gut biome etc. Indications of gut inflammation, low iron, high estrogen. But nothing I've done with them has shown any significance to the joint pain. I've tried digestive enzymes, atrantil, ginger, vitamin b complex (can't tolerate anymore), l glutamine (made me depressed), testosterone (highly irritable).

I'm also suddenly very sensitive to medication/vitamin absorltion. I used to be on 50mg of Zoloft, but now I can only tolerate 1/4 of that. I used to take vitamin b and drink coffee and now it sends me into a panic attack. 

When I have these joint pains, it's not consistent what triggers it; eggs, certain spices, gluten, intense temperature changes, repeated movements etc. Tylenol, Ibuprofen, etc sometimes help but not always. The most painful parts are my elbows, shoulders and hands. Feels like someone's squeezing them. 

Anytime my bowels get agitated 
as well, this also tends to happen, so it seems their may be a link to stomach inflammation triggering the joints or some connection. Hormonal fluctuations also trigger the flare ups. 

My PCP recommended me to get a second opinion with a rheumatologist and a connective tissue doctor. I've done SO many labs and have an x-ray scheduled. I'm just so frustrated.  ",1,1737685640.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

We met for coffee and then we went back to his later, we chatted and then watched a movie in bed together. We cuddled, frotted and kissed, it was so lovely but unfortunately I couldn't stay the night. But I'm going meeting him again this weekend for a night.

I'm just maybe insecure, but Id honestly love to ask him on a date because we get on very well and we chat everyday and he's mentioned a few times that he likes me. 

But I just feel I'm not right for him. I'm worried about getting into a proper relationship after being in a situationship for close to 2 years. I kind of feel too maybe I'm out of his league, as he's way better looking than me. Also I'm only out to my mom and I feel if I'm not out to the rest of my family it could hinder my relationship with him if I were to bring him to my home town and if someone say us together it could cause some issues. 

I'm torn, I don't know what to do, Id love him as a friend, but also in a relationship as in Ireland it's next to near impossible to be in a gay relationship in anywhere but Dublin. I've never been in a proper romantic relationship either so again I'm just nervous maybe 😅. My biggest issue definitely is my family especially my brother and father, as my mother is very open.

I hope one of you guys could enlighten me with some sense as I don't know where I stand

He’s my first and only relationship. He works in a family business that demands most of his time, often not coming home until after 11 pm. Early in our relationship, he prioritized his work to the point where he felt guilty even going on dates with me. After I changed jobs, there was a period where he had to support us financially. Even before that, though, his work was still his main focus, often leaving little time for us. His job has always been his life. I’ve found myself feeling very lonely—eating most meals alone and doing all the household chores. At one point, he left the family business and joined me in the corporate world, and for a while, we were happy and healthy. But then he decided to go back, believing the family business couldn’t survive without him. So we moved states to be closer to his family. Since then, I’ve lost friends, become more isolated, and struggled to find a sense of purpose. I fought to pull myself out of that depression, but it feels like he doesn’t care about my needs. Despite me voicing how lonely I am, nothing has changed, so I’ve stopped expressing it. I’m super focused on my career right now, but his family is pressuring us to have kids, and that idea scares me—I’m afraid of being stuck. He doesn’t celebrate when I achieve something and instead something wrong will happen that day. He thinks that doing small things like making coffee, cooking occasionally, or walking the dog shows support, but it feels like little effort in comparison to what I need. He says he’s a good man and always tries to be a good partner, but when it comes to spending on me, he’s stingy, even though he’s generous with his family. He rarely gets me gifts, and we don’t go on dates. He says it’s because our dog has separation anxiety and can’t be left alone, but he blames me for not training him while he’s at work.

He has no assets other than his brand new car. His primary expenses (housing and groceries) are covered by his wife, whose own assets are separate from him and in a trust. He has a business where he sells his art, but his art business is hitting it's 2nd or 3rd year of not being profitable. The main things he spends money on as far as I know are getting coffee to get out of the house, personal care items (diapers, clothes, deodorant), and fishing stuff. He gets a monthly social security payment. With all of that said, he has a lot of credit card debt that he is only paying minimums on. 

He has no plans to finance any large purchases in the future, so I don't see a need for him to attempt to maintain good credit. His wife and I have been pushing him to get rid of his car, and he has been amenable to the suggestion, as his wife and him can share a car at this point. His wife is financially independent and does not need him financially for anything. If he needs long term care in the future, he will likely immediately qualify for Medicare and the family has been prepared for that eventuality for a while. 

My questions are - is there a way I can maximize his CASH flow at this point in time to where he is able to pay for his little ancillary items (coffee, deodorant etc) as opposed to putting it all towards credit card minimums? Additionally, If these credit cards are under a business name (which I don't know the answer to as of yet), is there a point where he can stop paying the minimums on them without it mattering - like if he stops his business due to lack of profit without filing for bankruptcy? Would it be worthwhile to look into renegotiating his credit card minimums to make his monthly cash flow a bit better? How much should I be worrying about his cash flow as he becomes less and less active in the world (and spends less and less money because he can't really leave the house)? 



Here are the specifics that I know for certain:

Social Security Income: $2,616

Credit Card Minimums:

Capital One Card 1: $525

Capital One Card 2: $175

Capital One Card 3: $119

Capital One Card 4: $163

BOA Minimum: $270 

Chase Card: $335

Discover Card: $204

Phone Bill: $142.93 (I'm working on convincing him to get with another cheaper phone plan, but he is \*still\* paying off an old phone he no longer has that he financed, which is a large portion of the bill)

Car Payment: $536 (his wife pays for car insurance for them both)



\*\*TLDR: My retired dad is (assuming he gets rid of his car) netting about $682.07 a month (which, no, isn't that bad!) in cash from his Social Security after paying credit card minimums. Any suggestions on how/if I can assist him in improving that?\*\*

We are the same age and we met at our friends visitation. He recently moved to my town that i moved to in April, we started hanging out and then one night he confessed feelings and I friendzoned him basically but he still wanted to be friends. He knows I'm going through a lot and a breakup. Lately our conversations have mainly consisted of the importance of celibacy as a Christian. . Anyway last night we hungout at 3am and got coffee and I was feeling ok but I could tell I was just annoying him somehow probably talking too much.  Anyway I went home and went to sleep and I had a dream we were in a room and then he suddenly got aggressive and I realized he wasn't going to listen to me and he was angry. I said I needed to use the restroom and he said no, I said I was having stomach issues and then I got out of the room and as soon as I reached the stairs I went out the door and bolted down the street. I ran up to this big fancy house and they left the door unlocked and so I opened it and went inside locked the door and layed down on the ground under the window. I heard footsteps coming and pretended to be passed out. It was the rich girl that lived there and she spotted me and i told her exactly what was going on thinking she would have my back but then I saw him approaching the door looking extremely angry with furrowed brows. I bolted for the stairs I could hear him talk to the girl. He asked if he could come in and she just said yes. So I ran upstairs to this room and there was a ton of huge rooms and hallways and I hid in one of the rooms upstairs and locked the door. Unfortunately there was a swing door beside the door that locked and he just walked right in. The End.

1i8kibu,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassicBookClub/comments/1i8kibu/rebecca_chapter_5_spoilers_up_to_chapter_5/,Rebecca - Chapter 5 (Spoilers up to chapter 5),"Hi, everyone! We're doing something slightly different with this book.

About a year and a half ago, we read *The Moonstone.* I'd read it before and loved it, so the mods allowed me to run the discussions on Fridays, providing recaps of what had happened in the story that week. *The Moonstone* was a mystery novel, so weekly recaps helped us keep track of what was going on. Since I nominated *Rebecca*, the mods asked me to bring the recaps back. *Rebecca* is not technically a mystery, but it's still mysterious, so I'm hoping that weekly recaps will still be useful.

I have to admit, I'm a bit anxious about this. I've never read this book before, so I'm as in the dark as the rest of you about what's going to happen. I'm also worried that this story won't lend itself as well to humorous recaps as *The Moonstone* did, since it seems to be a more serious--wait, what's this?

**Mrs. Van Hopper**: I'M HERE TO SCHMOOZE WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE AND EAT RAVIOLI, AND I'M ALL OUTTA RAVIOLI! Goodness, are you u/Amanda39 from r/ClassicBookClub? You know, my nephew's neighbor's cousin's dog knows u/Thermos_of_Byr, so we're practically family! Oh, but will you look at the time! I'm supposed to be in my room, spreading influenza to a large number of guests, because social distancing hasn't been invented yet. Toodle-oo! \*puts cigarette out on the discussion prompts.\*

...Okay, now that that interruption is over with, let's get on to the recap.

The book begins with the protagonist, whose name is [Charlie Brown teacher noise], dreaming about a house called ""Manderley."" If you went into this book not knowing anything about it, you now know that it's a Gothic novel. Things don't get any less haunted once she wakes up, either: our nameless narrator is apparently living in a sort of exile, along with a man who seems to be severely traumatized. They're hiding out in a small hotel, trying to distract themselves and not think about whatever it is that had happened to them in England. But the Nameless One starts to remember, and I suspect that everything from this point forward will be a flashback.

She-who-must-not-be-named is a [lady's companion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady%27s_companion), currently in Monte Carlo with Mrs. Van Hopper, whose large, tomato sauce-stained bosom she is paid to be friends with. Mrs. Van Hopper likes hobnobbing with the rich and famous, so she's set on getting to know Max de Winter, who is staying at their hotel. Our narrator isn't quite sure who Max de Winter is, though: just that, from what Mrs. Van Hopper has said, he owns a house called Manderley and his wife died. The three of them end up having coffee together, Mrs. Van Hopper completely missing de Winter's sarcasm and the narrator romantically comparing him to a man from a medieval painting. But despite his annoyance at Mrs. Van Hopper, de Winter seems surprisingly interested in [REDACTED], and later sends her an apology with [404: NAME NOT FOUND] spelled correctly.

Mrs. Van Hopper gets the flu, so the narrator eats alone, and de Winter asks her to join him. They mostly talk about the narrator, her work as Mrs. Van Hopper's ""friend of the bosom,"" and the fact that her name is actually >!made you look!<. They go for a drive afterward, and they eventually end up at the top of a cliff, where de Winter dissociates. He eventually snaps out of it, starts rambling about the flowers at Manderley, and gives Rumpelstiltskin a book of poetry. The book offers her a couple of clues about de Winter: a well-read poem that seems to be about fleeing God, and an inscription from ""Rebecca.""

>!You fell for it again!< finds herself going out for drives with de Winter again, and lying to Mrs. Van Hopper about practicing tennis instead. She spends the next page or two comparing herself to a schoolboy who's obsessed with an upperclassman. That's a weird thing to compare herself to, right? Am I the only person who thought that was weird? I kept waiting for her to say ""Senpai noticed me!"".

Anyhow, once she gets done mentally reenacting a shonen-ai anime, she manages to make things even more awkward by saying that she wishes she could save memories to relive them. De Winter patronizingly pretends like he doesn't get that she's flirting with him, and their conversation ends up with her finally addressing the elephant in the room: she knows he has a dead wife. De Winter begins to open up (slightly) about his trauma, revealing that he wishes to forget the past. She thinks he'll want nothing to do with her now, but instead he tells her to call him Maxim.

But then the jealousy starts. Who was Rebecca, really? What was she like? And why did she get to call Maxim ""Max""?

**Discussion prompts**

1. This is a very description-heavy book. The first chapter is almost nothing but description, for example. It's not just visual, either: there is a heavy emphasis on scent, with Maxim talking about the flowers in and around Manderley, and What's-Her-Face saying she wishes she could bottle memory like a scent. This led to an interesting discussion back in Chapter 1, where u/siebter7 shared what it's like to read (and dream) with [aphantasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia). I'm curious to read what everyone else thinks of description-heavy writing. What goes on in your head when you read?

2. What do you think of de Winter so far? Romantic? Creepy? Sympathetic?

3. Rebecca calls de Winter ""Max,"" but he tells the narrator to call him ""Maxim."" Why?

4. Anything else you'd like to discuss?

1i8kddq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1i8kddq/excellent_writing_about_caffeine/,Excellent Writing About Caffeine,"I came across one excellent post about quitting caffeine on Internet and I wanted to share it here. It is written by Austin Baltes 3 years ago on Quora in response to a question about quitting coffee for a month after minimal coffee intake in the past and still feeling exhausted without it. 

Here is what Austin B replied:

“That’s not an uncommon experience. It my experience, I’ve quit for over 3 months multiple times and I was never the same off caffeine as on it. This time, I’m crossing the 4 month mark now and I am starting to notice a slow improvement. A lot of people have views on how long it “should” take to feel normal after quitting caffeine, but they look at it strictly from a biochemistry or cellular perspective.

For many of us, caffeine has almost never not been in our system since we were kids. Imagine taking any other psychoactive drug daily for all those years; wouldn’t you expect that there wouldn’t be larger changes than just the receptors in cells? Would you not expect that a person’s entire persona would be massively affected?

One thing you’ll notice is that caffeine changes the person you are. What works off caffeine is not the same as what works on caffeine. You have to play the game differently. When caffeine entered the world, it produced golden eras in every region it encountered. It had a lot to do with the renaissance and the success of industrialization. The view that caffeine is a net zero impact in the long term is simply not true. You will never be the same person on caffeine as off caffeine. It’s not better or worse, just different. Just don’t try to compete with someone on caffeine with the same approach they take.

Caffeine creates a sense of well-being. It allows you to ignore pain in a way. The fatigue you feel now was probably always there, but you never took care of it because you were given a potion to ignore it. When you’ve depleted your body so much, you may need more than rest to recover. Move to a super healthy diet, run (circulate lymphatic fluid), support your adrenals, do a liver detox, do a kidney detox, explore herbal medicine. For thousands of years people have treated themselves without the benefit of even the scientific method: they would go into nature and know exactly what to eat to treat their ailment. They do this in the same way we have a gut feel of who we want to call if we’ve had a particular flavor of a bad day. Animals do this too. They could do that because I’m most of human history people were much more sensitive to their bodies. Among many reasons, caffeine may have created the situation where we are quite numb to our bodies, not just as individuals but as a culture. This has made us prosperous with our minds and out work. On the other hand, one of the gifts of being caffeine free is that you feel this fatigue: it means you are more sensitive to your body. The hard part is you didn’t have a lifetime of sensitivity to know how to deal with this off the bat. The other hard thing is you live in a world where no one else is sensitive, so it’s not particularly friendly to your needs off caffeine. It’s like you suddenly gained the ability to smell and now the fact you’ve been living in a latrine is uncomfortable. None of your friends can smell either, so they also live in latrines, so even if you move out of yours, you’ll still have to visit them in theirs.

All this means is that quitting caffeine is a commitment: a commitment to feel. You don’t just get to quit caffeine and be the same person. You’ve invested years into the caffeinated self: now if you choose to, you’ll have to develop the un-caffeinated self. You won’t be able to just hide from your fatigue like you use to - you’ll have to solve it.

One of the advantages of being off caffeine is that you might see that time seems to go more slowly. Caffeine makes you intensely care about whatever is in front of you and constantly feel rushed. Anyone who is not on caffeine feels slow. Now you feel slow, but maybe in this state, you won’t neglect the important things that aren’t front and center, like your physical and emotional health, but also your family, friends, and your true desires. Maybe in this state, you will make that phone call, notice your future love, or move to your dream career. Once you figure out this fatigue thing, you’ll also be needing to find a unique approach, because you might not be able to win on intensity alone. Going off caffeine is a trade from the known to the unknown: ask yourself is life actually better outside the Matrix? If you can’t commit to all that the unknown entails, stay plugged in.

1i8kcit,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i8kcit/should_i_stay_or_leave/,Should I stay or leave,"TL;DR: I like her and I need someone who looks at this from the outside to tell me if I should I dump her and move on or stick around

  
27 y/o male here. I really am falling for this girl and when this happens I usually don't think straight and have more emotional reactions and end up getting hurt. I need advice from people who look at the situation from the outside to know what's the best possible scenario. To be clear, I'm not necessarily looking to be with her if this is what's required for me to be happy. If leaving her is the way to go then I'll take this path. I just want to stop overthinking and for eveything to flow...

  
Long story short, we met at work. She's a 22 y/o girl at my job and we started chatting and went out on a few dates. I want to act like a gentleman so I drive her, I pay for the dates (she made me pay a $7 bottle of water at the movie theatre...). It's been a month since we're dating yet she still is very distant to me. Tried to kiss her but she said she needed more time. We hug and hold hands. When we're together, she tells me she thinks about me, she enjoys being with me, she wants to plan things with me.  
However, 

\-when we plan dates over text, she's only available weeks after, yet she goes out with her friends regularly

\-she takes hours to reply to my text messages, yet when we're on a date she's always on her phone. I had to call her out on it last time because of that, she put the phone down. 

\-sometimes we're in the middle of a text conversation at like 8pm and then she stops all of sudden to reply and i hear from her only next morning (not a good night, nothing, I'm just left there on delivered)

\-she seems to always be out/at coffee shops/working out/with friends but when we make plans I have to wait days or weeks for us to see each other...

  
I really like her, and I think she knows it, and I wonder if she might be taking advantage of me. My head is messed up right now and I'm thinking of ending things with her because I'm tired of feeling like a second option to her plans yet she keeps telling me she feels good around me and she asked me to go on a date together in a few weeks...



What should I do? Am I overreacting?

1i8kat4,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1i8kat4/crazy_two_days/,Crazy two days,"So, my first post was on the day that me and Travel Buddy (TB) officially linked up to travel together, even if we're here for the next week lol.

We picked up her gear from a mutual friend that let her stash it there and we were off to make camp.

WHAT A MISTAKE, it was realitively warm for an AB winter night, but the WIND, gusts of well over 40km/hr had the tent threatening to blow down even after securing poles doubly with extra rope low on trunks of surrounding trees (got a good laugh at TB when she started fussing at me that it was ""dangerous"" for me to go out and tie the tent down. Like, unless you wanna wear it as a blanket in the next 10 mins, its gotta happen relax).

Yesterday we were both in a (reasonably) irritable mood with the sunrise, but a shared cig and a few laughs had us in brighter spirits, knowing our next steps for the day, (warmth and coffee) we set out for a nearby tims.

Sat there maybe 3 hrs, just chatting, sipping slow to stay warm, who walks in? Gear stash friend, tells us to stop by later in the day for a drink and a cig its supposed to snow.

We do just that, snow starts, we hit the road. Get there and sure enough a round of coffee and baileys bc whats better than coffee on a snowy afternoon, and the baileys is just for a warmth boost lol. We shoot the shit, watch some cheesy 60's movie, snow stops. We say our goodbyes, its gonna be dark soon, wanna get to camp before the temp drops. GSF stops and kicks back 2 camp mats he no longer uses AND a sick little hand flashlight. Thank him, toss him a few cigs for the generosity.

Last night was colder, but the camping mats worked much better than the cardboard did the night before, and no wind to boot. All in all, a win for the day in my eyes.

That brings us to today, wake up, cig, gotta pee lets head out. Into tims, pee, coffee, cigs, warmth.

Come 11am, TB's phone goes off, her cousin had referred her to a church in hopes of getting her some help, we're about to head out after checking the distance, 5 blocks, not too bad, go to get to walking, a guy at another table comes over as we're packing up, says I know its not much, but its cold lemme give you guys a ride. We enthusiastically thank him for the offer. Get to the church, they ""cant do much"", they gave us $100 in gift cards for food, thats not ""cant do much"" imo.

Pastor asks us what our stories are, so we tell her our plans, shes appalled at the idea that we're out in the cold, not judging, just concerned. Asks us if anything at all would help, we tell her, honestly one of those one burner camp stoves would be kick ass for both heat and cooking.

She leaves the room, comes back about 15 mins later, tells us to follow her, we do. She takes us outside in the alley, says nows a great time for a smoke if you do, I dont know the next time you'll get one is (its already been about 3 hrs, we take our chance)

Next thing we know, like cig isnt even done, a white van rips up, and shes introducing us to her husband. ""I don't know what he has planned, but I pray its helpful.""

Yall, this man, he takes us to a Walmart, saying ""I've traveled, not the way you two are, but I've done my fair share."" Tells us to go get some new boots (I liked mine, but lets be honest, by the time you like them, they're usually thread bare) and some good wool socks cause ""its cold out here, they're great for sleeping not really for walking"" fair shit man.

We get in, go towards the boots, he tells us he needs to do some shopping too, so he'll meet us at the register, he shows up with what looks like an empty cart (like hes pushing it with one hand?) So im like, ""you want some help with something, we really have nothing but time""

HE SWINGS A BASKET FROM BEHIND HIS BACK, its a single burner stove and 4 cans of propane, i ask why the cart tho, he looks me dead in the eye says, ""when I heard camp stove i was thinking of one of those big ones for RVs, had one loaded up till I stopped and asked someone in the camping isle, but I still wanted the surprise of a grand entrance"". I havent laughed that hard in months.

We get to the entrance of Walmart expecting to say our thankyous and goodbyes, they've helped so much, and he goes ""you don't think you're getting away without lunch do you?"" Asks TB her favorite place to eat and we're back into his van off to Wendys, have a great lunch and he says ""let me drop you two off near camp"" shit, thanks man!

He drives two lots over turns into a nearby hotel and says ""come on we're here"", fuck dude really? THANK YOU!

So now me and TB are layin back enjoying a room, I just wanted to update yall, but before I reply to any of you TB just got out of the shower so now its my turn. Cant wait to feel that hot water!

1i8karx,https://i.redd.it/hgid418ykuee1.jpeg,Birds of a feather flock together,"Maybe some in here likes Stina Wollter but to me, she's just another person who craves attention and has to stay relevant no matter what. 

It's also very telling that she's friend with Rachel 🙄

Just a short description, but@stinawollter  is  an artist and got famous for body positivity, posting videos of herself dancing. This is great and she made a big impact but she's very attention seeking and I don't know.. I don't like her vibe. She's the kind of person person who will hang out with other celebrities just to stay in the spotlight.

She also got very questionable friends in the ""celebrity feminist elite"" and it doesn't surprise me at all that these two hang out. 

It doesn't seem very genuine, and they're just using each other for different reasons. 

Why else would Rachel randomly mention she'll have ✨friends✨ over for lunch and then post them in stories? 

My guess is that Stina Wollter has friends within TV, books and radio and Rachel wants to be profiled as a body activist somehow (even though we all know she's got an ED and hates her body). 

Stina Wollter in return probably doesn't mind getting posted for 2 million followers either, as her newest TV showgot cancelled some month ago. 

Long story short but she posted antisemitic information on her account (Palestine vs Israel) and probably trying to save some face and be welcomed back into the warmth again. 🤷",3,1737683417.0,rachelbrathensnark,0,1.0,False

1i8kahq,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmovies/comments/1i8kahq/rewriting_watch_dogs_1/,Rewriting Watch Dogs 1,"Watch dogs 1 has been released for 11 years now and is one the most debated games on Ubisoft’s history with some praising as a great game while other call it a gta clone. Watch dogs 1  itself is heavily underrated possessing plenty of opportunities to be a stand out game and even a GTA competitor. But while the game could have been the best game of 2014 it had multiple flaws that prevented it from reaching global superstardom being its story pacing,lack of side character interactions and cutscenes and a rushed story.instead of wishing the game was better here is my pitch on what would’ve made this game more interesting act by act. 

ACT 1: 
Act 1 opens the same way it did in original game with Aiden and Damien committing a cyber heist but instead of it failing it’s a success as we find out that it is 2011 in New York rather than Chicago. We cut to one month later we’re see aiden pearce arriving to Nicole’s house for Lena’s birthday party during the opening mission we see a happpier and sarcastic aiden, where interacts with Nicole, Lena and Jackson even playing hide and seek with the kids there. Once the party is over aiden then receives a call from Damien to meet him at a bar to discuss a big score. 

Aiden arrives at the bar where Damien along with one of their contacts discuss a job that involves a high stakes poker game in the higher levels of the prestigious hotel merulat we’re the money is spent is wired and transferred onto a big server. Partners in crime Aiden and Damien take the job but will need extra help for this job, a sniper, another hacker and two extra gun men one at the merualt with Aiden and another protecting Damien . The preparations begin with Aiden reaching out to Jordi Chin and Iraq  while finding a hacker by the of Cassandra. The night of the heist comes with each member taking possession with jordi Chin entering the building with Aiden as protection. While Iraq is stationed as a bodyguard for Damien and Cassandra. The heist goes smoothly up until Aiden and jordi reach the server we’re Damien starts exploring where he shouldn’t blowing their cover sending the whole hotel into a lockdown. During aidens escape Mirko is shot in the leg and is unable to run so tells Aiden to escape and the he will manage the authorities. 

Aiden arrives at the hideout rightfully angered at Damien for blowing the operation but Damien goes on the defence saying that everything was good on his side but there is a rat amongst them trying to sabotage them. We cut a week later where we see Aiden lying low and spending his time at Nicole’s place socialising with the kids even taking them fishing, shortly after Aiden receives a one of a kind call from Jordi who Aiden thought had died, jordi explains that during the firefight he hid in hotels ventilation system and has been there for a week and needs aidens help to escape due to his bad leg.

Aiden arrives revisiting the hotel that was turned into a battle ground where he helps Jordi escape the police that are also there. By the end of the mission he is surprised to be meet by Damien waiting at Jordie place, then scolding Aiden for going back to rescue Jordi and that daimen was planing and Aiden could’ve but them at further risk. 

Time passes and Aiden and the rest of the crew are called to a laundromat were they wait for money to be counted and picked up. Everybody arrives except for Cassandra as she called in sick, this drive Damien’s paranoia through the roof, but Aiden has had enough of it and calls out Damien on his sudden change of personality becoming more controlling and paranoid but before things can further escalate fixers swarm the laundromat firing from all sides. Everybody escapes but Damien tells Aiden to go for a ride with him to Cassandra places for some questioning, the pair arrive at Cassandra’s apartment we’re daimen begins interrogating her but things escalate yet again due to daimens paranoia besting him pulling out a gun even threating her but then daimen pulls trigger as he was startled when her boyfriend walked in the end killing the both of them.
The mission ends with Aiden berating daimen for his recklessness and saying that he should leave New York while he still can. 

In the final mission Aiden is called by non other than daimen again with a change of tone in voice saying that he and the group should meet for the last time. Pearce arrives a the set location where he sees everyone there except Mirko and Jordi daimen tells all of them to get in the car and Aiden to drive, they stop at house where Aiden stays in the car while daimen and Iraq go in the house, soon there a gunshots and screams coming from the house with daimen and Iraq running to the car revealing that they were doing a robbery with Aiden as their getaway driver. 

The trio drive through suburbs with Aiden scolding them both of  daimen and Iraq but as they were driving a van collides with aidens car crashing on a bridge. Aiden is the first one to wake up and get out of the car were he sees an army of fixers approaching them from both sides of the bridge. Amidst the chaos daimen quickly regains consciousness and yells out to Aiden for help as he is stuck but with fixers quickly approaching Aiden jumps of a bridge to escape. 

Aiden makes back to his home were he finds his spare phone and rings Nicole that he will be taking Lena and Jackson on a fishing trip to Newark for a few days. While driving up to Newark a fixer is able to track Aiden in a tunnel and shoots Pearces car tire sending the Pearce family crashing. Aiden gets out of the car to help his niece and nephew but only to find out that Lena had died on impact. The final mission ends with Lena’s funeral and a cutscene between Nicole and Aiden. 

Act 2: 
Act 2 opens up a year later were we see that Aiden has tracked his niece’s killer Maurice Vega to a baseball stadium where is able to capture him. From this point act 2 remains the same as in the original game with Jackson’s birthday, the fixer contract, not the pizza guy mission, the auction, Nicoles kidnapping and the prison break in and break out remaining all the same. The only changes to act 2 come in its final few missions were Clara and Aiden have to track down Raymond Kenny to decrypt some files that daimen needs in order for Nicky to be free. So their searching leads the pair to Newark were Aiden finds Raymond Kenny in a bar where he beats Raymond in drinking challenge and try’s to convince T-bone to come with Aiden. But then a massive bar fight ensues when Aiden push’s a man that tried to get T bone out the bar. But by the end of fight Aiden is knocked out

 3:
 Act 3 starts with Aiden reawakening on a boat where he is being interrogated and tortured by the same man he started the bar fight with. Where man from the bar continuously beats for information about who he is and his occupation in Newark. Aiden then cracks under the pressure from the abuse but instead tells the man a fake name of Carlos Manno. Before any more nefarious acts can be done the interrogation is interrupted when the boss of the Romano crime family Micheal Romano alongside his right hand man Jorge Sirco and begin asking their own questions. The man who attacked aiden begins telling the events of the bar fight before he shot and killed by Micheal out of frustration for using his boat as place torture. before Jorge can free aiden Romano tells him that he now works for them now and that they’ll be in touch.

As promised aiden Pearce receives a call from  jorge the following day where he tells aiden to meet at a coffee shop called little Sicily in Newark. Pearce is greeted by Giorgi and is introduced to the rest of the Romano crew who  are directly inspired by T he sopranos Sammy is a knock off Silvo, Giorgi Sirco is based of Paulie nick and joespi are direct copies of chirssy and furio. 

aiden Pearce is then properly introduced to Micheal Romano in where Romano explains to aiden that he is now indebted to the family for not only saving his life on the boat but has to pay for the damages he caused during the bar that will cost 20,000 dollars. Micheal Romano further explains that he needs aidens unique set of skills to help take down the De Guzman family the Cuban cartel that has been in a thorn Romanos side for the better part of a decade. 

After this encounter Aiden Pearce is put to work and goes on a slough of odd jobs from protecting the Romano family from police and helps dismantle the Cuban mob with Jordi chin and even working with the most feared hit man in New York Vincenzo Moicano while trying to track down Raymond Kenny at the same time.

By the near end of the 3rd act the Cuban mob have been disbanded with the romanos on top resulting in nick receiving the opportunity to become a made man, while at the post inciation party Aiden seizes the opportunity to hack into everyone’s phone to see where everyone had went in the last two weeks when he finds one that stands out from the rest being Tommy Tenznio cousin who has been going to an abandoned ski resort on the outskirts of Newark daily. Further digging reveals that Tommy has been a federal informant for the past three years.  Discovering this new information Aiden is able to locate where the evidence is being held and hacks into the police precinct and copies the evidence using as blackmail making Tommy a messenger for aiden Pearce 
. 
This works and Aiden revives a letter from T-bone revealing his current state, that T-bone was captured by the Romano crew while fleeing from New York and made them use his hacking skills to not only spy on the police and rival competitors but to also find any incriminating footage to be used for blackmail. In the letter Raymond also writes that he can’t escape because he has a small explosive device strapped around his waist on the lower part of his spine, with it exploding if he goes more than a meter away paralysing and the kill switch being with Micheal. Also T-bone mentions his armed junkyard that needs to repaired 

Learning this Aiden devices a plan to help Raymond escape but before Aiden can finalise his plans, Tommy has a sudden heart attack due to the high levels of stress and rushed to the hospital. Knowing that Tommy will snitch, Aiden decides to leak the incriminating evidence to Micheal in where in response Micheal sends nick to silence Tommy. 

With Tommy no longer in the frame Aiden is prompted as a temporary overseer for Raymond Kenny while Micheal and the others have a big deal coming up. Aiden Pearce uses this time help Raymond escape in where he uses the signal from belt bomb to attract rest of Romanos men to the armed junkyard. But before act 3 comes to an end Aiden tracks Micheal down to the same boat he was interrogated on and kills him before leaving New Jersey good. 

Act 4: 
Act four opens up with Aiden and T-bones return to New York in were Aiden goes finish off Iraq and to downland the data. While in Iraq fortress Aiden learns that Iraq was the second hacker at the merlaut and was going to betray the group from the start using the money to buy the management of the human trafficking auction and to further build his criminal empire. 

After Aiden kills Iraq we see that Aiden and Clara’s relation has grown from a professional partnership into a strong friendship where Aiden finally opens about Lena’s death and the guilt that sits in his shoulders. The act continues as in the original game Default leaking Clara’s phone call, Aiden rescuing Nicole and saying goodbye to Jackson. 

The change comes when Aiden corners lucky Quinn and hacks into his pacemaker slowly killing him, it’s only in his final moments that lucky Quinn reveals the truth that he used the videos to blackmail the president of the United states to not only aid Blume in their bellwheather program to control people and their actions but two also help America further advance into the Middle East. Also how Quinn was using Daimen and Iraq to gain all the blackmail and to clear his man with Blume. 

After Quinn’s death things play out as usual Clara’s death and Daimen taking full control of CtoS but at the ending instead of Jordi being at the lighthouse it’s instead Maurice. The same thing happens with Aiden exploding the light and throwing Maurice the lighthouse. 

After that Aiden is given the choice to either kill or spare Maurice and uses his hacking abilities to protect,expose and if necessary to punish

1i8ka1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/China/comments/1i8ka1j/chinese_girlfriend_social_trauma_and_frustrating/,Chinese girlfriend: social trauma and frustrating communication style,"I have been dating my girlfriend for more than a year. She is from Beijing, but she has been studying here in Australia for almost 6 years now… (99.9% of all her friends and the people she works with are Chinese, so culturally she’s in a Chinese bubble, hence the post in this sub-reddit, but she speaks English very well).

How we met …

We talked for like 10 minutes at a networking event and I was curious to find out more about her. What intrigued me was the fact that she was very mature for her age (she is 25, I am 34, but I look younger I’ve been told). I took her out for a coffee, but only asked very general questions (nothing related to relationships, just getting to know her, what she studies, etc). She started to share quite a bit, I would say, maybe a bit too much … almost felt like she was trying to impress me. Like she was showing me some of her modeling photos and videos of her playing the piano, singing, etc. I am normally turned off when a girl tries to show off when we barely know each other, but with her, I felt it was genuine and cute.

How we started our relationship and how she expressed her emotions ….

A few days later, we met for a morning walk and breakfast, but we ended up spending the whole day together having wine after our walk and talking about life and our future. When we wanted to say goodbye, I gave her a kiss on the cheek and she looked so pleasantly surprised. She had a big smile on her face when she left.

I had to travel abroad for a few weeks and when I came back, she had to go back to China to visit her family for the new year (I should also mention that since then she has visited China another 2 times, every time like 1+ month, once for work, once for a funeral, not a problem for me in itself, but more on this later). Before she left, I asked her over to my place, and told her that I really like her and I feel we shared something special. Then I gave her a Christmas gift, a necklace that I got her on my trip with a note that you were on my mind this whole time. She got very emotional and turned the other way, as if she didn't want me to see her teary eyes. I tried to kiss her on the lips, but she told me that she is not ready for a relationship, because she was hurt in her previous relationship. I told her my intention for this is to lead to marriage, so if she is not ready, then I am not interested in playing games and I think I should stop asking her out. She quickly said, “no, I didn’t mean it like that”. And then she went on to put on the necklace I gave her.

Up until this point, great, she is super responsive and very open with her emotions.

Social trauma and anxiety …

When she came back from China, we met frequently, like every week, sometimes more. She would always bring me little snacks and also cooked for me a few times. Lots of compliments (oh, you’re so tall, so muscular, so smart, etc, I know this is how many traditional Asians show their affection, rather than just saying I love you).

4 months in, we went on a trip together and she told me she had a lot of fun. We finally kissed but I stopped and asked her very bluntly if she is still hesitant about the relationship. She said, no and she really wants this to work.

She also shared very personal things like how she feels insecure sometimes, that she is not as good as many of her colleagues, that she had to deal with depression during COVID, how she feels she is constantly being watched and judged, etc. How she feels like she is expected to take care of her parents when they are old and she is worried about that … How in China, she didn’t even like to play any team sport, because she felt like everything was like a competition and there was always someone better.

On the outside, she comes off as a very confident person, and she told me that no one knows any of the things she told me, not even her parents, close friends, or ex-boyfriend. I was supportive and told her that I feel closer to her now that I know her vulnerabilities and it only makes me love her more. I told her we are a team and if we work together, we can complement each other.

Things started to get weird ….

6-7 months in, every time I asked to hang out, she said she was busy with work. One day, I got frustrated and told her that I can at least bring her some food and groceries, because I am afraid, she is not taking care of herself. She texted me back that she thinks she is not a good partner and I could do much better than her. She feels guilty every time I bring her food. She told me that she doesn’t think there is anything special about her, and why would someone like me (according to her, handsome, smart, successful, blah blah) love someone like her??? I don't understand her one bit, because I genuinely think she is beautiful (she has even modelled before), also very smart (doing a PhD) and charming.

Later she told me that she is struggling with her studies and, also facing financial difficulties. And when she goes into panic mode, she basically shuts down and feels worthless. I offered to help (for me, it’s a very small money, but for her, it makes a big difference, and I look at her as my future wife, so why not), but she refused to accept, saying again that she hasn’t been a good partner, and she doesn’t deserve my help. A few weeks later, things went back to normal (I think she somehow managed to overcome her problem, she doesn’t share much and when I ask, it makes her uncomfortable).

I have told her that she was a lot more open when we first started dating and I want to be there for her during difficult times. Long story short, (very indirectly, basically I had to ask 100 yes/no question and she would just nod her head, even too shy to look me in the eyes), she feels like she’s a burden and that I would leave her eventually (some kind of abandonment /attachment issue, maybe from her childhood as both parents were always working and she grew up alone at home since very young?).

I have told her many times that I am even ready to settle down and discuss marriage already now if that gives her peace of mind, but she said, no, love is supposed to be a journey and she loves me for me, not for what I can give her. Then there was this 1-month period that she didn’t even return my texts. Based on what she had shared with me about her past, I was really worried about her mental state, so much so that one day I went to her office and asked around about her (they don’t even know me, but they said she's been working from home for a while now). 3 days later, she texted me, that she is ok, and I shouldn’t have done that, because now everyone is asking about her and also about me. And again, she feels like she is being watched and judged. I got frustrated and told her, that she should come to my place, so we can talk and if necessary, call this relationship off if it bothers her so much. She said she doesn't know ""how to face me"" and ""she should stop troubling me"". 2 weeks later, she came, I did all the talking, and she agreed with everything, like my god….. it seems like in her eyes, none of this was out of the ordinary. Things were back to normal and she only needed some “me” time. This is so weird. Like doesn’t she realize how much she worries me? I have told her many times, that it's ok if you need alone time, just tell me. The silence is what I can't accept.

Things are a lot worse over text. Like when she visits China (which is very often as I mentioned earlier), I try to keep in touch over text, but her responses are always delayed and very cold too. In person, she's like totally different, very affectionate and pays attention to everything I say. She has told me before that I ""distract her"", as in when she gets any text from me, she can only think about me and starts to overthink. Like one time when she was traveling, I texted her ""I was looking at our photos, I miss you"", she said she felt she was a terrible girlfriend for having to leave me to visit her family China and I have only her photos to look at for 1+ month. Ridiculous, I know, but because of that, I try to keep my texts to a minimum, like maybe 1-2 texts a week. I have a lot of Chinese friends/colleagues too, and I know the communication style is different (the whole thing with ""face"", avoiding confrontation, etc) and I know privacy is a sensitive topic (lots of nosy people meddling in your personal life), but this feels like an extreme case....

TLDR:

Chinese girlfriend has some kind of social trauma, thinking everyone is watching/judging her, and that she is a burden and I will abandon her because she is not good enough. She's wonderful in person, but the closer we get, the harder she tries to be distant and not fall in love. I have no idea what’s going on in her life / what's on her mind. Is this a cultural gap?

I don't begrudge the staff for getting the gifts, but if council has to entice people to a Xmas party with this kind of thing it speaks volumes about the current culture there.......


CITY of Newcastle splashed thousands of dollars on expensive gifts purchased with ratepayer funds for its annual Christmas party celebrations, the Newcastle Herald can reveal.

As the cost of living crisis pressure hit households, Newcastle council went all out on its Christmas party celebrations in December, treating staff to a host of big-ticket lucky door prizes.

In an email to staff enticing them to attend its Christmas functions, the council spruiked it would give away a host of gifts including a hot air balloon ride, skydive, walking pad, Nintendo Switch, Dyson Airwrap, power tools, theatre tickets, Nutribullet, portable speaker, Yeti cooler, Cool Cabana and recliner camp chair.

Retailing for $849, the Dyson Airwrap was one of the most coveted Christmas wishlist items last year. The high-tech hair styler was featured in several luxury gift-giving guides, and it's understood that City of Newcastle gave away three.

The council also gave away Christmas hams, tickets to Portside festival, tickets to Howlin Country, beach towels and Visa, gold-class cinema and dining gift cards.

By comparison, Lake Macquarie City Council gave away 48 $50 gift cards in the lead-up to the festive season, and the state's largest council, City of Sydney, gave away no gifts.

It's unknown how much of ratepayers' money the City of Newcastle spent on its Christmas parties and gifts, as it refused to answer questions.

The Herald sent the same questions to councils across the region and to City of Sydney, requesting information about expenditure on Christmas celebrations.

Newcastle was the only council that refused to provide details.

""City of Newcastle provides a Christmas party for its staff, just like most other employers in Australia,"" a spokesman said.

""Responding to these questions which aim to denigrate City of Newcastle and its staff isn't a valuable use of time.""

It's understood City of Newcastle held three Christmas functions. The council's chief executive Jeremy Bath and lord mayor Ross Kerridge attended all three.

The first was at council's works depot in Waratah on Friday, December 20, and staff members who attended the morning event were provided with coffee, food and a ticket for a lucky door prize.

Dozens of prizes were given away, including about 20 Christmas hams, power tools, beach towels and $100 gift vouchers.

The second party was held at Newcastle Museum later in the day and a staffer said dozens of gifts were also given away there. Hundreds of staff who attended were provided with drinks, including alcohol, and there were food trucks for meals.

""There were a lot of prizes with the big ones being a hot air balloon ride and champagne breakfast, skydive and people were desperate to win this Dyson hair thing. I think they ended up giving away three of them,"" they said.

""There was a lot of excitement around it because the prizes were so good and there were so many, it felt a bit like a game show.""

It's understood council gave away two Dyson Airwraps in the lucky door prize draw, but due to the overwhelming demand for the high-end hair gadget, a third was announced, and the recipient was told they could collect it from council's Stewart Avenue headquarters at a later date.

Another attendee said they thought City of Newcastle could have made better use of the money.

""As a ratepayer of Newcastle I think the funds could have been better spent,"" they said.

""I don't think the general public would think it's a great idea to spend their money that way. It was a lot.""

A function was also held at City Hall on December 17 for executives and councillors, and their partners, who were provided a three-course meal and alcohol, and Paralympian Lauren Parker was the guest speaker.

Lake Macquarie City Council gave away 48 $50 gift cards and held a staff party at the Multi-Arts Pavilion, at Speers Point, it said. Staff received three drinks tokens and three food vouchers, costing $72.60 per person, or $35,000, slightly less than what the council spent in 2023.

A separate function was held for executives and councillors, and their partners, which 60 people attended, at a cost of $4200, which was less than the cost per head of the staff party.

City of Sydney gave away no gifts and had one Christmas function that cost $34,500 for food and beverage, or $71 per person, which was almost $8000 less than it spent in 2023.

A spokeswoman said Port Stephens Council did not fund or facilitate any Christmas celebrations.

""Port Stephens Council is in support of staff organising Christmas celebrations, either as teams or social clubs, at their own cost and outside of work hours,"" she said.

Cessnock City Council provided a barbecue breakfast in the staff lunchroom, including a raffle where Christmas hams and other small items were given away, and an outdoor lunch for 60 staff. The total cost of the celebrations was about $7000.

Maitland City Council held two functions at East Maitland Golf Club, one for staff and another for executives and councillors. A council spokeswoman requested more time to provide a full breakdown of costs as she said staff were prioritising storm recovery work this week.",8,1737683187.0,newcastle,7,0.9,False

1i8k1c6,https://i.redd.it/5k7eldgkiuee1.png,"Friday, January 24, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Irreversibility"" - The Smoldering Ruins of Burning Bridges: Why You Should Think Twice Before Severing Ties • [Click to Expand]","## Bridges We Burn, Connections We Lose: Navigating the Importance of Lasting Relationships



Imagine standing at the edge of a bridge you’ve just set ablaze. The flames crackle, smoke billows, and all that remains on the other side is a fading memory of what once was—a friendship, a professional connection, or even a family bond. Burning bridges is an evocative metaphor, isn’t it? It’s about severing ties so completely that there’s no going back, no chance of reconnection, no opportunity for reconciliation. But why do we do it? And more importantly, why should we try not to?

Let’s dig into this idea together, like we’re having a cup of coffee and chatting about life’s complexities. The phrase “burning bridges” originates from military strategy; soldiers would literally burn bridges after crossing to ensure enemies couldn’t follow. But in our personal and professional lives, it means cutting someone or something off so definitively that the relationship or opportunity is irreparable. Sounds dramatic, doesn’t it? That’s because it is. And while it might feel cathartic in the moment, burning bridges often leads to more harm than good.

### Why Do People Burn Bridges?  
There’s a certain allure to burning bridges, especially when emotions run high. Maybe you’ve had a falling out with a coworker, and quitting in a blaze of glory feels like reclaiming power. Or perhaps a friend betrayed you, and cutting them off feels like the only way to protect yourself. It’s easy to justify these decisions in the heat of the moment. 

But here’s the thing: most bridges aren’t burned because of thoughtful consideration. They’re torched in a fit of anger, frustration, or hurt. I remember a time when I was fresh out of college and working my first job. My manager was... let’s just say, less than supportive. After months of pent-up resentment, I handed in my resignation with a pointed email that left no room for ambiguity. It felt great—until I realized I’d need a reference for my next job. Ouch. 

Burning bridges is often an emotional response, not a rational one. And while it might feel empowering in the moment, it’s worth considering the long-term impact before you light the match.  

### The Long-Term Consequences  
Think of a bridge as more than just a connection between two points. It’s a symbol of possibility, a pathway for collaboration, understanding, and even second chances. When you burn that bridge, you’re not just cutting off someone else; you’re limiting your own opportunities. 

In the professional world, this can be especially damaging. Imagine you’ve had a falling out with a boss or coworker. You leave the job dramatically, thinking, “I’ll never need them again.” But life is funny like that. Industries are small worlds, and reputations travel faster than you’d expect. The coworker you had a spat with might end up at your dream company, or your former boss might become a decision-maker in a field you’re passionate about. Suddenly, that scorched bridge isn’t just a memory; it’s a roadblock.

And it’s not just about careers. Burning bridges in personal relationships can leave you isolated. A family argument that escalates into estrangement, a friendship that ends over a misunderstanding—these are bridges that, once burned, are difficult to rebuild. And while we might convince ourselves that we’re better off without those connections, the truth is, humans are social creatures. We thrive on networks of trust, empathy, and support.

### When Burning Bridges Feels Necessary  
Of course, there are times when burning bridges might feel like the only option. Toxic relationships, abusive environments, and situations that compromise your values or well-being may require a clean break. And that’s okay. Sometimes, protecting yourself means letting go completely. 

But even in these cases, there’s a way to walk away without setting the bridge on fire. You can establish boundaries, communicate respectfully, and leave the door open for future growth. I’ve learned this the hard way. After a particularly toxic friendship ended, I was tempted to send a fiery text that laid everything bare. Instead, I chose silence. Years later, that friend reached out, apologizing for their behavior and expressing a desire to reconnect. Because I hadn’t burned the bridge, I was able to decide—on my terms—whether I wanted to rebuild it.

### How to Avoid Burning Bridges  
So, how do we navigate the impulse to burn bridges, especially when emotions are running high? Here are a few thoughts:  

1. **Pause Before You Act**: Give yourself time to cool off before making a decision. Anger and frustration are temporary emotions; the consequences of burning a bridge are not.  
   
2. **Communicate Clearly and Respectfully**: Whether it’s a breakup, resignation, or ending a friendship, approach the conversation with honesty and kindness. You don’t have to agree, but you can leave with dignity.  

3. **Focus on the Bigger Picture**: Ask yourself, “Will this matter in five years?” If the answer is no, it’s probably not worth setting the bridge ablaze.  

4. **Seek Closure, Not Conflict**: Closure doesn’t mean slamming the door shut; it means finding peace with the situation. Sometimes that means walking away without fanfare.  

5. **Keep the Door Open**: Even if you don’t foresee reconnecting, leaving on good terms ensures you’re not closing yourself off to future opportunities.  

### Rebuilding Burned Bridges  
What if you’ve already burned a bridge? Is there hope for rebuilding? The answer is: sometimes. Rebuilding takes humility, accountability, and time. If you’ve burned a bridge and regret it, consider reaching out with an apology. Be sincere, acknowledge the harm caused, and express a desire to make amends.  

But remember, rebuilding isn’t always possible—or necessary. Not every bridge needs to be crossed again. What’s important is learning from the experience and moving forward with intention.  

### The Power of Connection  
At its core, the idea of not burning bridges is about valuing connection. Life is unpredictable, and the people we meet along the way often circle back into our lives in unexpected ways. A kind word, a thoughtful gesture, or even a neutral parting can leave the door open for collaboration, forgiveness, or friendship down the line.  

I’ve seen this play out in my own life. That manager I mentioned earlier? Years later, we crossed paths at a networking event. I apologized for my hasty exit, and to my surprise, they were gracious and even helped me land a new role. It was a humbling reminder that relationships are rarely as final as they seem.  

### Conclusion  
Burning bridges might feel satisfying in the heat of the moment, but it’s rarely worth the cost. By pausing, reflecting, and choosing connection over conflict, we can navigate life’s challenges with grace and integrity. The bridges we build—and preserve—are not just pathways to others; they’re pathways to our own growth, understanding, and success.  

So the next time you’re tempted to burn a bridge, ask yourself: Is it worth the fire?

But I'm going to keep driving. (Update 8),"It called itself Lume. I asked em’ if they were willing to a wait a while. I wanted to let my Trainee rest up a bit still if she needed it. Her rollin’ and stirrin’ to see what was wrong was reassuring, but I feel like good rest and sure hearts need to go hand in hand.

Maybe that’s why I keep mucking things up. Maybe I don’t-

No, don’t you get thinking like that, J-

Hrm. Sorry, I’m just a little. Frazzled.

So, they say ‘yeah, okay’. Their voice is like a buzzing light if someone was trying real hard to make words out of it, and they somehow managed it. And they kind of hummed, like when you leave an old light on and you sit real quiet and. There it is. Bzz, but gentler. I didn’t know why, but I trusted them. Felt, even, like I owed them something. I went to sleep myself feeling all sad and wistful.

When I wake up, when I fix breakfast and I’m bout to go for the milk, I see one of the faces on the carton looks just like theirs. Now, I get concerned. It means one of three things, see. Either I let someone dangerous onto my bus, someone who had gone missing had just washed up onto my vehicle - these are not at all mutually exclusive, mind you now - or someone was trying to make me some kind of trade.

I go up, and they’re just sitting there. They seem to be… Switched off? Like when you pull a lamp and it goes out, but if it could pull its own cord. So it ‘blinks’ awake, I see a flash of its little head beaming yellow real watery till it’s bright and clear. I frown a bit. Not because I find it distasteful, but because it’s a real casual hazard to go waving about possibly shining in people’s eyes. And the definition of harmin’ folk can sometimes be very… Loose.

My Trainee goes up and yawns, and I look at her thinking how strange some of the folk I ride with are. I remember what she told me, and I’m thinking about the… Moon thing. I’ll be honest, I had a few other reasons for, erm, switching means of getting this out there. While I’m not 100% certain where these end up, I know that I can just keep a. Different copy, for myself. Cut out a few words and show her the other.

I know it’s kind of deceptive. I’m trying to keep my voice low because of it, not sure if you can hear that. We’re at that one hotel. Er, motel I mean. She wanted to… Have space. I don’t really… I don’t know. I don’t know what I can say. I can hear the moon whispering to me now. It’s one of the few things from that mall venture that’s 100% clear in my head. I guess it noticed it stuck, since right now it’s saying things down to me.

“Please. Don’t let them come back up. I did not mean to hurt them, I threw them down so they could not be.” That’s what I just heard.

I’ll… Get back on track, sorry.

My Trainee sits with that Lume fellow. It has a lot of little drawings in its hands, and when I look down, I see they look a lot like the ones I found down in my hatch. On the slips. Now, here’s the kicker. I see it writing a few words on some of them, but the writing style doesn’t match any of them. But, well, I don’t pry. I think it’s a friend, we exchanged the word between us, but you still don’t. Just do that.

Of course, that idea didn’t hold up long. I sit down, make sure it still wants to go where it told me. I check what it put in the box, and I see a little origami shape. It’s made of the same material Ori seemed to be, and had a little bit of… How to describe it. Inky-black, crimson-red on it. Like some kind of strange blood. I’m thinkin’ it was, in fact.

It looks like a cat.

“Did you… Make that?” I ask em’.

“No. That was my friend.”

That’s not a very enlightening term, in this instance. I feel this twinge of rememberin’ at the back of my mind, but it doesn’t swim all the way up. I decide to let it go, for a bit. I get this sinkin’ feelin’ in my guts. Enough of one, in fact, I can’t quite get myself to put into gear and get the bus goin’.

“...You wanna drive? The whole way, this time?” I’d done a couple goes with her, so figured the Trainee could handle the wheel a bit. It was a little selfish, but it was also important. And I’d rather not drive while I’m so sure I’m not going to be seein’ down the road quite so clearly.

She nods, gets up and takes the seat for me. I guide her slowly through the routine again, but she already seems to be getting it. “You drive before?” I ask her.

“Nothing like this. I’ve driven a buggy.”

“Like one of those… Those off-roading ones I’ve seen the wallers drivin’?”

“More a… Moony type of buggy.”

I don’t really know how to proceed with the convo, so I go a couple seats back and sit down. Somehow it feels like intruding, but I listen as she and the passenger start talking. I get antsy, like not driving means I’m abandoning a really important routine. I sort of am, but, well, that’s the point. No. Retiring, not… Abandoning. I would never abandon the bus. I get this strange thought like I’m sure a few other people wouldn’t, then doubt for one.

I don’t butt in. I’m too busy thinkin.’ I don’t fully pay attention, I find it hard right then, but I catch some. They talk about where they came from. The Trainee mentions a palace of some kind, and Lume talks about a dark place with lots of lights. A long, winding place, organized in particular ways. They mention being in the dark for a long time. Metaphorically, mostly, they clarify it’s pretty bright down there when their friend wants it to be. When they want it to be. They kinda shine their light to demonstrate, and the Trainee curses as she almost swerves, getting blasted in the eye with a yellow beam bouncing off the rear view.

I think she was trying to be friendly with em’, like I tried to be. And I think that soured her mood a little, since it was quiet, mostly, the rest of the way. We weren’t too far from some of the walls, my weather vane was pointing clear north. And the roads felt. Short. It was a longer ride than usual, though, since my Trainee can’t see it so she just drives through the regular. Eventually, we get to the walls, all tall and good, thick concrete and barbed.

There’s a lot of phrases running along the length of them. I don’t think I’ve ever really described them before, have I? If I look up, they kind of tower real tall, like someone ten times my height or more kept trying to hop it like a fence and they’d almost overcorrected. There’s these. Whatcha call em’. Wide booths, with glass windows, sittin’ every couple miles or so. Always someone - someone like me, something else - sittin’ there wearing something real casual or real formal, the latter all yellow and blue usually.

The walls, in their scratches, shout out things like ‘please mind your weapons’, ‘property is not given until its promised’, ‘it’s safe in here, we are civilized’. I think they’re more like a charm than a warning or whatnot. Like the ones I paste to my door and windows sometimes. I’ve driven almost blind before, you know, those things just. Crawling along the inside of my bus like I’d gone cuckoo bonkers.

There’s big old gate doors next to the window spots. They’ve got a real thick looking side door, too, but that’s just for the wall watchers. I’m pretty sure if I tried to drive through any part of it at full speed I’d smash my front in like a crushed can. That is to say, you probably aren’t getting in if they don’t want you in there, though long as you’re real respectable and not up to no good you can probably pass through.

I wait, just in case. I see my passenger get off, and I feel this guilt riding a wave of a twist in my guts and some real unmannerly relief. I get tense, like I do sometimes, send up a prayer, but for some reason I find myself feeling a hell of a lot more strongly about this particular soul gettin’ into those pearly gates than I’m used to.

They perform the checks. Ask em’ why they want in. They don’t have to, but Lume leaves something - a drawing, I think - in this wide tube that sucks up the gift and deposits it on the other side. Most people leave something. They call you friend at the gate because of it, I think. So there’s no… Awkward consequences, then or later. I think they make mistakes sometimes, though. Like when I let someone not meant to be onto my bus.

Before they go in, they ask me if I can wait a little bit for them to come back. When I ask how long, they say a few hours. I say okay. I sit there with my Trainee, and I smile and tip my hat at her, because she did pretty good. I then kind of realize I put myself in a little bit of an awkward spot. Thing is, that special little word technically clears you of obligations, least unless someone else is involved, but I still feel obliged to see them through as best I can.

But I need to make my routes. I ponder it for a bit, then I roll my shoulders. “If I wait here, will you do the real close runs? There’s some regulars that make small stops, and, well. I think maybe it’s time for you to do a… Solo shift.” It was possibly a little too early, but I wanted to see what she can do. I wanted to know that, if I went up and vanished, she’d be able to handle it.

As she drove off - she’d asked me if I was sure, and when she went she looked a whole jumble of nerves - and I sat nearby for a bit. I minded the flowers and any little discarded things. The nastier folk have a tendency to try to leave valuables ‘accidentally’ for the gate folk, specially when the greenpants of their sort are about. The kind of stuff you might step on, and bam. Bad situation.

To my surprise, I see the fellow at the gate pull up a little pamphlet, flip through, then nod to himself. He’s got a mug, he sips at it. *Number #1 Dad*. I’m not sure if it checks out grammatically or not, but it makes me smile a little. Though my little smile drops away when he speaks.

“You’re already approved, you know. You don’t have to wait outside.”

I kind of knew it already, but I still blink and stare.

“Would you… Like to come inside? You can wait in here, if you want.”

I purse my lips. Rub my hands. It’s chilly, though I can’t quite remember what season it's supposed to be. Eventually, I nod. I’m curious, and I feel vulnerable. As my bus gets far enough away, there’s this. Cord snap feeling. All the roads drop away, I panic for a bit, then after I sort myself out and decide I’m sure it’s temporary I go on through.

Nothing really… Interesting happens. I can see my own bus moving on this set of screens they got in there. It feels strange, looking at my world through a monitor instead of a map. I see some folk pass through. Nobody too remarkable. At least, not till I see… Well, I guess she goes by Lupe here? She comes in from the outside, and she walks in, and she sits down, and she kind of just stares at me for a bit like I don’t belong.

“She doesn’t bite. At least, she doesn’t bite people who tie their laces right.” The fellow watching the monitors says.

“What’s the point?” I let slip out. It just. Felt like I had to ask.

“Making sure everyone gets where they need to go. Where they *want* to, at least.” I see him pause for a second as he lifts his mug, then sigh. “You do something similar, right?”

“What do you even know about me?”

“That you’re a man with a lot of dedication who does his job to the best of his ability.” He goes quiet, for a bit. “You ever been to the end of the road?”

I almost ask him what he means, but I know. “I’m not sure. If we’re talking the literal end, yeah, a bunch o’ times. If we’re talking what’s past it…” I stare out the window for a bit. “...I don’t know. All I know is lot of people want to go there, too. And a lot of people come from there.”

“It’s not worth it. If you don’t think you’re meant to be there, if you don’t feel like you need to be there - you, not someone else telling you - then it is not where you should be.” Lupe speaks up. She’s doodlin’ something between spurts of reading.

I kinda lose my gumption for talking. It’s awkward, and it’s tense, but only for me. The other two chat away like I’m not there. I have a hard time not thinking about Lupe, she’s right there, and I think about the other one, the collar, and they’re not the same - I know it in my heart - but it’s still a reminder. And I’m following the giant, and the wolves are chasing me, telling me it’s their hunt and not mine, and I’m not listening.

Give me just a second. I need…

Okay.

Eventually, the bus slides back into view, golden eyes peeking through the trees and stopping along a road winding through the treeline. At about the same time, Lume comes out, and they go back to the bus. I take that as my cue to leave, and as I go I see the fellow with the mug watch us for a bit, sipping his coffee. I’m not sure what he’s thinkin’, but his face is screwed up in that subtle sort of way one puts it when they’re thinkin’ some sad thoughts.

“How was… Over the wall?” I ask the little feller.

“It was surprisingly boring. But I think my friend would love it. They did not look at me like I did not belong. I told them I had all the parts.”

“The what?”

“It doesn’t matter anymore.”

“...Alright then.”

As I settle into the driver seat, I ask the Trainee how it went. She says surprisingly well. I talk with her, make sure she did all the right things, that she didn’t notice anything odd and if anyone weird tried to come around. It sounds like all was smooth, and I’m proud and I’m pleased as punch.

The little guy asks me if he can go somewhere else, now. He asks me if he can go to a motel, a particular one, and then if they can go to Angelvale after. I see my Trainee tense up when they mention the second place, and I know exactly where I’d heard it before, so I give her a puzzled look. I say yeah, sure, but I lay out clearly that they have to pay and confirm each time, otherwise however far we get counts. They think that sounds swell, so I drive.

The roads all come into focus again. I picture in my head the old map getting scrawled over by the new one. The world gets stranger, but it doesn’t get smaller, and in my head I know for sure even though my map has some edges and blank spots, with some swathes of walls drawn on it in particular shapes, it’s the same map. It all cuts up, like a puzzle handed out in slices and put back together wrong.

It gets me thinkin’. Course, the next pattern distracts the heck out of me, to say the least. So I stop thinkin’. I make stops along the way, as I always do. Pick people up, put them where they go, and watch for changes in the posts. I see Copyhat a bit more than usual. Makes me wonder who puts up the posters, notices, ads and whatnot. Do they just. Poof in? Or maybe there’s someone with a real particular job.

At every stop - I stop at about twelve places, do short routes mostly - there’s a rabbit. I should rephrase. There’s a rabbit mixed with something else. They come solo or in pairs of up to about four. Now, my bus isn’t for the metropolitan areas. It’s a coach. I’ve always had to drive long distance. That means around 40 to 60 seats or so. Luggage bay, ramp. Pretty sure the hatch is non-standard.

There was only one seat not full. My Trainee refused to fill it, and instead went down into the underbelly of the bus. No one pried. But they all looked like her, if you arranged her different. Rabbit paws instead of hands, little rabbit feet. Head, torso, tail. But they all had people clothes on, and they were mixed with something roughly human and proportioned right. The ones with human faces seemed uncomfortable most of the time, had glassy eyes.

They all paid in utility items, and some of them were medical. I now own twelve med kits. One of them put in a rock, and when I whispered to myself where it could’ve come from, they just said ‘moon rock’ and sat down.

All of em’ wanted to go to Angelvale. Couldn’t help myself. I asked if there was a reason they felt comfortable telling me for the big gathering. They said ‘the moon is coming’. I supposed the full moon was soon. Then it dawned on me I wasn’t supposed to let my Trainee outside during the full moon, and I wondered how it made sense I’m pretty sure at least one full moon had passed over us without nothing crazy happening since I’d met her already.

I think I’m going to find out soon. But this one ain’t for her. I’m not planning to have to remember her because she’s gone, but because I’m proud of her. 

So when a new stop is made - you ever see a hoard of rabbits sorts go into a convenience store? All at once? - Anyway, I ask my trainee if this is the family she talked about. “Sort of.” She says, making this halfway wavey gesture. She’d put on this fancy dress she’d gotten way back in Fish - or from the mall, one of the two - and a little tiara. I’m pretty sure it’s a costume. It feels like she waited till they got off for her to get it on. She goes back down, changes back into uniform, comes back up, just sits there.

“So they’re… Good folk?”

“Yes. But not the best.” She’d done a little twirl in her dress, frowned over herself and smoothed wrinkles out of the fancy clothes. Now she was doing it with the uniform, and she made a face like it was disgusting and slimy, then she made a face like she was guilty for making the first. I couldn’t help but make a face of my own at that.

I look at Lume. Little flashlight head just starin’ out the window. They’d turned it off when the bus got crowded. They seemed to be very careful where they looked. If I paid attention, they seemed to be antsy about shadows, flickin’ their head the other way if they caught their light on one or almost had. “I think it would be nice to have such a large family.” They did a ‘blink’, light off then on. “I suppose I have one. But they aren’t as… Animated.”

The rabbits come back in, all rank and file, and their chatter is suddenly a lot louder in my ears. When I look at the convenience store, through the window, I see someone fussing with a lot of different kinds of trade items. It kind of dawns on me that I’m gonna need to refill on cardboard at the Office again already. That mundane thought settles my nerves, and I’m off to the motel.

The whole. What was the word she used? Attendancy? Herd? The whole fluffle goes on into the motel, checks in one by one, and I see the front desk looking kind of flustered and befuddled. I think around then it’s getting late. I wonder how long I’d been driving. Guess I’d been sittin’ around and herdin’ rabbits all day. Whole time, Lume was patient, didn’t seem to have much sense of fear in them, just quiet thoughtfulness. I noticed they watched the left side of the road, though, quite a bit.

That’s around when I decide to give motels a go. It’s when the front desk pulls up some really long list, and they ask me if my nickname has changed and if I need new accommodations. I look at them for a while, then I just kind of shrug. “I don’t think so.” They look at me odd. “Okay, erm. No and no.” I guess I’d checked in there before. Honestly, not a big revelation for me. I’m mostly on the bus, but I can’t have always been. I remember otherwise. I know otherwise.

I offer to get the Trainee a room, and she says sure. The little fellow looks for a coat rack, and I guess they find one. They look outside. It starts to rain lightly, and I figure maybe they had a sense for weather. Or maybe they just paid a lot of attention. My joints throb a little sometimes if the weather is about to get strange, and I guess they could’ve picked up on that. Though there was a tension in em’, now. Stillness.

“You okay?”

“I hope it does not rain long. I want to get home sooner.”

And that’s that. Everyone gets settled. Everyone gets a key. I see a man in a gray suit pass us while I walk down the hall, and he nods and smiles at me in a way that makes me frown. I pick up on the fact the hallway is really, really long. I can’t see the end of it. I pass a plaque with hotel - motel - rules on it. *No smoking (inp), no illicit substances (inp), no using the number 44 stairs (p), no unapproved liminal rewrites (depends)*, and a few other things. What stuck out to me was the little footnote saying inp stood for ill-advised not punished and p stood for punished. It also clarified *Formality in effect*.

I made a note of it, then went into my room. They gave me one close to the entrance, and thus the bus. I appreciated it. The other two went down quite a bit further.

I kind of paused in the doorway a sec, stepped out. Looked down the hall again. I wonder where all the rabbits had gone. I saw one standing outside of a doorway a long ways down, one that had proportioned but still awkward paws for hands. They fussed with the knob a bit, frowned, and then looked back down the hall at me. They mouth somethin’. But they’ve got a rabbit head still, so I don’t quite understand.

I wonder if I should check on them, but they manage and go inside. When I turn back to my own room, I see that it looks, well. Like my bus hatch. The only difference is everything personal is gone, replaced with something plain. Even the slips are there, but I’ve got no idea if they’d work. There’s the lappytop and the little boxes, but the former isn’t mine and the latter is just kind of filled with generic junk.

I get this vision in my head, almost. Like I’m standing in a before. There’s ugly wallpaper with flowers painted on it. A prim and proper little white desk, some simple lamps with boxy shades. An old telephone, the kind that you can’t carry in your hand. A vase with flowers in it, a shaggy but orderly carpet. There’s a tv on a stand, and I flick it on.

I checked two channels, both in black and white. The first one introduced - or, well, ended - itself as *Improper Crimes*, and I watched a man with a penchant for smoking puffing a cigarette. He looks at the camera, and he speaks to me, but not actually me. “And that, my friends, is why you don’t let a ghost do your writing for you. You never know when they’ll get exorcised. It might lead to an… Improper Crime.” A title card dropped, with a classical stinger.

I turned the dial. Saw a new show.

“The thing you’re about to see has not happened. Yet. These are scenes from that story. A story that will happen as soon as *these* men are ready.” It showed me an astronaut climbing along the hull of a funny looking spaceship, some men getting ready for some brave act, some fellows working at desks. Then a launch of some kind. “-This is a countdown. A missile is about to be launched. It will be the-” I forget the name of the thing, but they mentioned a fancy title. They said it meant ‘experimental moon probe’.

I saw a man talking to his son, giving him something. Kissing his wife. I think the thing he gave to the kid, the kid was supposed to return to him when he came back. His wife said something about him being back in two days, and she was real sure of it.

I saw a title card come up, but I went over and turned it back off. The telly, that is. I didn’t want to know how it ended. I felt like I already did, but I couldn’t remember if it was pleasant or not. I sat down, and I felt the weight of my bones and skin wash over me, like all the fatigue of time was catching back up to me suddenly. I looked at the door, and in my mind’s eye I saw it turn black as could be. I saw a dark, long road, with lots of people walkin’. I felt like I’d walked that road.

I didn’t know how many times.

I thought of restin’. Sittin’ or layin’ down, and thinkin’ a while. But I didn’t really have time to. “As soon as *these* men are ready. A countdown.” I heard a deep, narrator type voice, the same one I’d heard a bit ago come from the bathroom. I furrow my brows. I look down at my withered old hands, and when I get up there’s a crack in my back. I smart, curse a little as is impolite, and shuffled my way over. I’d brought my bag in with me, pulled out my hammer.

I slowly opened the door. Meant to pop it just a tad, kinda eye the floor beyond to see what kind of space was on the other side. Instead, someone grabbed the door, pulled it all the way open, and I saw something’s head beaming down at me. It was bright, and yellow, and it was coming from a flashlight that was a little too big shining right in my eye.

I stumbled back, blinked my watering peepers. When I saw again, it was black beyond the door. All I see was the head of the torch, burning bright at me. “Please don’t leave me alone.” I heard Lume’s voice, then. “You never let me-” Cut itself off. Same voice, angrier. Then, mine, sounding like it was coming off a tape.

They spliced things I’d said together. “They had my face. It didn’t take as long to find my trainee as I expected.” The light moved slightly, tilted. “I put a sign on my door.” It came a little closer, the light. But the thing holding it didn’t move into the room, yet. “But, could you do me a favor? I didn’t do good today, I think.” I heard something shuffling. “I want to be a good driver, and get people where they need to go.”

I got off my feet, though it took some effort. My legs were trembling, and they wanted to freeze. My own voice kept talkin’ at me. “You. You drive the bus.” There was a pause. “I want to see the real ocean before it goes away.” Paraphrased words I’d spoken, repeated perfectly.

I think it might’ve been trying to trade something with me. Like it had with Ori. I didn’t want to listen. So I scrambled towards the door, almost knocked over one of the lamps. I caught it on the way out, righted it, so I didn’t invite trouble. And I shut the door behind me. I had no idea if I was safe there or not. I hadn’t done anything wrong, yet, but when the world turns upside down something it’s hard to remember where you’re supposed to be.

I looked up and down the hall, listened for a bit. I didn’t hear anything strange coming from behind me. My Trainee, though, she came up to me. Rather, she was standing outside my door, off to the side a bit. I jumped when she spoke. Her good ear was propped up, turned towards the wall my room was in.

“I hear it. Their heart. It sounds… Worse, somehow.”

“I think we need to pack up and go. Right now.”

She looked at the door I’d come out of. She breathed strange for a second, then took a moment, tilted her head and screwed up her face like she was thinkin’. “Maybe we should talk to them. I want… I want to see if…” She measured her tone, her posture. Like she wasn’t sure on committing to anything just yet.

“It’s dangerous. It took one of my passengers. Only monsters take folk.” I was breathing hard myself. I didn’t want to have to run again, or move through dark tunnels. I just wanted to go to the bus. I started to, my legs carrying me to safety all natural like without my input.

I heard doors creak open behind us. This time, I looked. I couldn’t help it. I saw dozens of rabbits mixed with people, all in different clothes and with individual postures and expressions, peek out of, wander out of, tentatively step from rooms. I saw, amid that sea of fur and skin and fabric, a small light shining through the halls. It was angled down, and it cast a sort of. Light-shadow under all their feet, bounced off walls as its owner tried to look anywhere but into folk’s faces.

“I was going to come home soon. I needed to talk with the maintenance man first.” I heard their voice call.

From about half the doors, I heard a host of stolen voices. Some of them were coming from behind the rabbit folk. I saw them freeze up, others look behind, a few just move out of the door and close it behind them. “You can’t fix it. It’s broken. A witch takes your heart, it’s theirs forever.” I heard a gruff voice, one that sounded like it was trying to be not so gruff but was certain something wasn’t worth the effort.

“Make them wander for me.” I heard the voice I’d heard on the radio when the Lodge was after us, the one that’d sounded mighty different from the others. “Remember, don’t make them suffer. Kill cleanly.” I couldn’t tell if this was stolen now, too, or if there was someone else here.

I saw a rabbit disappear into a doorway. I think it was the one who’d struggled with the knob. It made a squealing sort of noise, and it was gone.

The lights flickered. I saw a storm of dark trailing down the hallway. Heard something being flicked. I didn’t know how the lighting system worked, hadn’t seen any switches, but there’d been rows of bulbs dangling from the ceiling.

I heard a lot of squealing. I also heard a lot of screaming. I saw a hoard of folk moving down the hall, towards us. Some moved carefully, others tried to hop or run in a loping sort of way, like they weren’t used to their own legs. I didn’t know what to do, so I sorted through my bag, tried to find something I could use. While I rummaged, called to my Trainee a couple things we could pull off the bus, I saw other folk being lost to the black.

More people went away than one set of arms could take at a time. I heard the shuffling of paper, a familiar sound, and I heard the clinking of tools. I swear I heard a noise like a train coming from somewhere among the madness. A little bright light was waved every way like someone running bobbing their light, trying to hold their flashlight steady in shaking hands and having a hard time.

I think that’s what got me to move. I remember who these folk were. I pushed my legs, and I started running. I tried to watch where my foot came down, but it was hard.

People pushed past me, and I almost fell. I’m not as fast as most people. But I could catch up to something that was coming towards me. As I watched folk vanish along the length of that long hallway, I saw a pattern. If someone pushed someone, and they thudded into the wall, they fell behind and their voice left the chorus. If someone stepped on something someone dropped, if someone peeked into the wrong door at the wrong time as they all opened up, they vanished.

The number of flashlights bobbing in the dark, the ones running in a pack, were many and ever growing.

Everyone who moved the right way, who didn’t so much as brush a soul too hard or stumble, outran the beast. I watched someone stumble, went to pick them up, and then someone stepped on their back to move around me. They elbowed me. A door to a dark and long tunnel opened beside me, and the offender was pulled inside.

Through a sea of white, browns, and grays I found my way to Lume. They looked down, made a noise that sounded like a choked buzz, and flicked off their light. I didn’t ask questions, I grabbed them, pulled them back by the hand. As I started going back the way I’d come, the flickering yellow and black catching up in sure jumps behind me, I saw a man in blue standing near the entrance. He was holding a wrench.

“I told you you weren’t allowed to use my tunnels unless you didn’t touch a hair on anyone’s head. Mine and yours are separate for a reason. This is my goddamn job, and I’m not going to let you take it away from me.” He started marching towards us, sure as god in his own domain. I think I saw a strange figure looking with pitying eyes somewhere behind him, at the far end of the opposite hall standing next to a stairway with the number 44 written on a plaque.

Lume rips their hand out of mine. The majority of the herd has passed us, but there’s still a few behind. I look over my shoulder. I see one get swallowed by the darkness. But as it passes over them, I hear them calling out a name. And it doesn’t sound. I don’t know, it just sounds right still.

Lume starts going the other way. I reach out on instinct, try to grab them. Something smarts, I might’ve moved too fast and pulled a muscle, and I fall to my knee as I lurch forward. My Trainee comes to pick me up, and she’s got the recorder from the bus. I hadn’t noticed she’d actually gone to grab some things. She’s got a mirror, too. I’m not sure what she’d planned to do with it. Maybe she wasn’t sure either.

It didn’t really matter.

She didn’t use the voice off her recorder, she just used hers. “Please. I need to bring them all with me. I can’t do that if you take them away.” She started stepping towards the encroaching yellow. The hallway was so long. How many rooms did this place have? Enough for everyone, it seemed. I realized I could pick out hissing, thudding, rattling and whispering all down the hall now that there wasn’t as much panic.

The thing in the dark tried to match their volume. “We gotta cook it while it’s still kickin’.  Ensures freshness, quality.” Cruelly casual. “I want to go home. Please. Just let me go home.” Pleading and desperate.

“We’re going to go somewhere very nice together. All of us. Where we’ll be taken care of. Where all the roads are straight, and everyone is always warm. Where nothing’s ever too dry or too wet, where every voice belongs to their owners, where it’s never too bright or too dark.” My Trainee drones on, sounding half herself, half someone on the moon.

I see the flickering pause. Just a second.

But it keeps going. More slowly, now, like something taking hesitant steps. With unsure footing it ambles down the hallway. The borrowed voices start to peter out, becoming overwhelmed by the real ones, and then those sounds fade away too as the people who had rooms here settled down. The people who belonged. Spaced as made the most sense, in accordance with what was left and where they most wanted to be.

I had been there before. It used to be, it’d seemed a nice place. I think, when I’d first flicked through those two channels, that it’d been a long time ago. I think this time had been the third.

I stepped after Lume, and the last of the rabbits filtered around me. The hunt must’ve been over - at least for now - since they moved calmly, more frazzled than threatened. I think they heard, saw, sensed something I hadn’t. I watched Lume go up right into the jaws of darkness. The light stopped right in front of them.

“I was going to come back. I always do. Please. Let’s just go home, okay? I think there’s someone who can help, still.”

“We can’t operate on those who didn’t give consent first. It violates the Formality. Please sign first.” The thing in the shadows had a clinical tone, all of a sudden. I saw my Trainee pause. I think I heard some of the rabbits stop shuffling away, turn, but I didn’t look at them.

The maintenance man walked by me. He slapped his wrench against his hand. I got a twist in my gut, and I moved to grab his arm. “Touch me, and I can break you, too.” Was all he said. And I was gonna do it anyways, I was gonna grab his wrist and tell him no siree, I think we need to give them a second. I realize, finally, I know both of them. I’d seen their lights before. I didn’t know them well, but I’d seen them shining.

He moved me down the length of the hall. I don’t know how he did it. It just. Happened.

“It’s fine. I don’t think it’ll hurt much.” Lume reached out. I think they grabbed the other creature’s hand.

“I am not flesh. Not anymore. It hurts. I think I’m broken.” A distorted voice came out, and I don’t think it was because of them that it sounded so strange.

“No. Sick. Like I… Like I was. And you helped me see again, so I’ll help you too. Just. Put them back. And let’s go home.” They stepped into the dark. I realized their light was off. I wasn’t sure what it meant.

“I love you. I wish it could’ve been different.” It used what might’ve been a line from some old show. I could tell by the feel of it, that far away echo old television has.

The maintenance man did not bother to wait for them to be over and done. He stepped up to them. His strides were longer than they should’ve been. He hefted his weapon of choice, gave it a test swing, then brought it down hard right on the light shining from the black. I heard the sound of shattering glass. I heard a scream that sounded like it was filtered through a broken light. I don’t think it was the voice of the thing that’d been struck.

The maintenance man used his wrench to point to a nearby sign. He trailed it from the words *liminal rewrites* down to *Formality*. He looked down, and I saw a beam shine out, aimed at his face. He just looked away. “Sorry. But you were both adults. You made your choices, and I’ll defend me and mine. I gave fair warning.” And he walked away. I think he knew I’d started fuming, since he vanished into a door. I saw a flash of a maintenance tunnel, one that I had a feeling didn’t have quite so many bulbs as the one I was used to.

The lights flicked back on. I saw something that looked like a cat made of wires, and cords, and metal with a big light for a head and a mane made from a lighting system. I think, in that last stretch, it’d been displaying it proudly. It’s strange claws had dropped a flashlight to the ground.

The rest of it’s pack looked nothing like it. They had a different sort of shape that stood on two legs, one that I suspect had long been deprived of any humanity. “Good hunt!” One said. “I miss the train.” Another spoke, voice all grainy. And they left. They retreated into doors that never should’ve gone to this place anyway, and they left.

A gnarled hand reached out and touched me on the shoulder. Another handed me a recorder. “This belongs to you, I believe.” I’d heard the voice on the radio before.

A witch made of pelts - many of which, I think I could trace back to a person, of all sorts of forms - stepped past me. I gritted my teeth and went to hit her with my hammer, one blow to the back of the head. I hated her, so goddamn much, and I won’t excuse my language. It was a familiar hate.

“You still need to get someone to their destination. You don’t break your deals on purpose, do you?” Her old, withered voice wasn’t filtered through static anymore. “Remember. You owe your friends little. But I’d dare say you should owe them at least that much.” So I stopped. My hands trembled, and I felt young again in the sort of way you do when adrenaline overrides everything else.

“Some animals will chew off their own leg to escape metal jaws. But not all of them will survive. Many of them will bleed out.” She stood in front of Lume like she was daring them to take a swing, but they simply turned their head down and shut it off. “You can keep this one. I’d hoped it’d be useful longer. I’m not cruel. I’m simply a hunter.” She moved over to a rabbit folk, looked them over.

Someone had struck them, with something cold and metallic. It’d left a bruise, but nothing more. It’d still been enough. “The dead escape their debts. But I do not forget the living who still have them.” She looked back at me. “Especially not those who cause suffering beyond necessity.”

I almost let her goad me. Said to look in the mirror. But I bit my tongue, and so did my Trainee. My Trainee didn’t even look at the witch. Just past her. “I can’t hear it anymore.” She said it a few times, till her voice trailed off.

The bog hag, the witch, the lodge master. Whatever she’d been. She just left. I think a lot of rabbits went with her. I don’t know what they’d done to make her want them in particular, if anything at all. But I think, maybe, that thing hadn’t hidden away in the shadows because it wanted to hunt.

I think it thought it was ugly. I think, some things, I think they wait till you think you’re so bad off you get desperate. The world seems. Dull, small, scary. And you look at the stars, and they seem so very bright, and you see somewhere perfect just out of reach.

If I look out my window right now, there’s a moon that’s not supposed to share the sky, small as a pinprick among the stars. They’re dull to me. But I think they’re shining very bright for some other folk. I think I need to keep them on the road, or I won’t be able to keep them from going up.

I have a Breville Barista express for like 4 years. This is my first espresso machine, and before that I had a semi automatic Gaggia (died). I like it in general but maybe I can upgrade.

I like coffee a lot and I’ve being more and more interested in special coffee beans. I have a subscription at a site that send me 4 different coffee every month so I can taste different flavors.

And now I’m thinking about a new machine. I just ordered a D54 and I’m waiting it to be delivered.

My routine:

In the morning I make some Latte Machiatto, Capuccino or anything else with milk. I use a Nespresso steam, witch is better than the Breville. 

During the day I take two more espressos and that’s the time that I like special coffees. I’m not a coffee nerd, don’t know much about beans and flavors and anything else. 

Sometimes I like the ritual of making coffee, sometimes I just don’t have time. 

I’m wondering if I really will benefit from a new machine. I want one that can make a difference but it’s not too expensive or too complicated. Design is important.

These are the ones that I’ve been looking:

1. Profitec Go - Good price, but no PID. No dual boiler.
2. Profitec pro - looks amazing, PID, dual boiler. But I never found one with 120V.
3. Rancilio Silvia Pro X - PID, dual boiler and 120V. But I feel it’s ugly.
4. Ascaso Duo PID - my dream machine. But never found a place that deliver to my country and a little bit expensive.

Which one would you suggest? Remember that I need 120V and I pay TWICE the price because of my country ridiculous taxes.

And: considering my profile, would be better if I stick to Breville?

Tks a lot.

I say soft only to mean it isn't hard. Not a lot of minerals that would make it hard on the machine and yet, with just 2-3 cups per day of coffee, after 45 days or so, it's pestering me about the water filter. I tend to do a rinse before I clean the milk system so there might be a bit more water pulled through than just for beverages but still, it seems like an abuse of power on the part of Jura. 

The power to pester and if the pestering doesn't work, to disable the machine which it did when I hit the actual 2 months, they recommend replacing it at. If they were reasonably priced and not $20 per filter, I'd probably not be as annoyed. If my water was hard, I'd probably not mind. If I brewed 10 cups a day, I'd probably not mind but none of those are true.

It’s not that simple. In fact, the only simple thing about dementia is telling people “I have dementia”. I tend to avoid the topic.
Initially  I only had little “blips”  like forgetting to blow out candles or losing my glasses, while they sat on my face. Somedays I struggled to remember why I’d walked into a room; unable to redirect or retrieve my own thoughts. I even stumbled over my name a few times when asked by the barista at my daily coffee stop. 

When I started getting calls from my job, asking where I was multiple times a week, I knew it was getting worse. I knew it was getting worse, but nothing felt different. Nothing really stood out as odd. 
I sleep the same. I eat the same foods. I listen to the same songs, and I watch the same shows. Yet my mind was running away from me; leaving me in a world of confusion and delay. 

One day I awoke at 8 AM per usual and noticed a foul smell. I couldn’t exactly pinpoint where it was coming from. I kept my home very tidy, and I lived alone.  As I exited my bedroom and stepped into the hallway, the smell grew stronger. A sickly-sweet, rancid smell filled my nostrils. I pinched my nose and walked towards my living room. Flies were buzzing around the ceiling and crawling up the walls. Their black bodies humming with hunger. The sound of their buzzing grew louder as I turned into the entryway of my living room. That’s when I saw it. I couldn’t even process what it was initially. A black, shriveled up, matted wad of hair lay in the center of my white carpet. I gagged, starring at the brown liquid secreting from its body. The flies danced around it, as I took a step sideways to peer at it from another angle. Hundreds of maggots writhed on its dirty wet fur. 

Just as I reached the thing, my phone rang from the other room. Stumbling backwards, sweat breaking out on my forehead, I went to retrieve it.

“Hey Aaron! How are you and Marley doing?”

I (18F) work at a coffee shop as my student job and there is this man who always comes when I am almost done my shift (I work the same hours so he figured the pattern out) and waits until I leave and waits in the parking lot to watch me leave. Once he even waited at the door so when I left he started talking to me asking me my age, which I told him I was 18 and walked away.

If I sit the coffee shop to study, when he comes in he will sit down at the table next to me to watch me study, and when I am on shift he just watches me work. 

I have already had an interaction with him when I was new at the coffee shop (15yo at the time) and he asked me for my phone number and I said no, and asked how old he was (He looked much older) and he said he was 26! I told him it was way too old and he replied “no its not”. 

Now, he has found me on facebook and sent a message request saying he “coincidentally” found my facebook account. I never gave him my name and my profile is private. We do not have ANY mutual friends (I checked).

I have it made clear multiple times that I am not interested. ex :walking away when he is talking, avoiding serving him and also he waits until my coworkers are busy to come ask me random questions, which I answer rudly (im trying for him to leave me alone).

I have talked to my manager about it and she just says she cant do anything.

I live with my family, and they know I smoke and such, but I just don’t want to blow up their kitchen, you know? But I own my own kitchen appliances, so I don’t mind washing my own things. Could anyone drop some yummy recipes or recommendations? Thank you so much!

I had genuine sleeping issues unrelated to caffeine for years and used coffee to manage that, titrating doses up when I was sleep-deprived and then titrating it back down when I sleeping better. Honestly, it did help me to cope during that period.

The cause of the sleeping issues has been identified and my sleep, while not perfect, has greatly improved. So, now I'd like to quit caffeine altogether.

I tapered down from roughly 300-400mg of caffeine per day over a 10-day period. It's now day 3 of no caffeine, including no chocolate or tea or any other sources whatsoever. My mood has been a bit flat and I've had some mild but tolerable headaches each day so far that I'm managing with aspirin.

I was incredibly challenged in the last few days of titrating down to zero caffeine when I injured my neck while exercising and kept waking myself every time I rolled over in my sleep due to the pain. It's far easier to quit this stuff when you're not exhausted from several lousy nights of sleep.

At present, the only thing I'm truly missing is my usual personality. I've just been a bit flat without my morning cup, so I'm hoping that changes in the days or weeks ahead. ",1,1737681630.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I always drank coffee—

1, 2, 3, 12 cups a day.

I chased energy that never stayed,

thinking, What’s one more?

What harm could it do?

The cost was distant, the moment sweet.

It was the same when I met you.

I was tired, hollow, running on fumes.

But there you were,

1, 2, 3, 12 cups of you a day.

You poured yourself into me,

honeyed sunlight on weathered skin,

a blissful warmth I dared not question.

I drank deeply,

not thinking of the consequences love would bring.


Then you were gone.

Not slowly, not softly—

just gone.

The sweetness turned bitter;

the warmth turned cold.

My laughter, once light,

is now a fractured thing,

smothered in the weight of my sobs within.


The tiredness I once knew

is nothing to this emptiness.

it does not fade,

it does not lift.

The crash of your absence

is sharper than any brew.

the burn unkind,

But I can’t stop reaching

for one more cup of you.

Funky's Dark Star is one of the most fun sauces I've had. It's not cloyingly sweet but any means, but the touch of brown sugar, cinnamon, and coffee really shine together. Good on chicken. I think it would gold hold up to lamb chops. Sings on beef and pork. I am planning to make a cheeky marshmallow fluff with it to serve alongside sweet potato fries.

She was something out of a thriller movie. I let her emotionally abuse me because of my low
selfesteem. She was a really good writer. We talk for hours about different things, topics and ideas.
Because of my isolation she was my only friend. Than a few weeks ago she told me her ""treating
 me badly"" was because she had DID but now she's better with the help of a psychologist and she's sorry for everything. Me being the stupid person that I'm wanted to forgive her at first but... I recognizeed something...
It wasn't the first time. Actually she always used weaponizing truma, mental health issues and even different mental illnesses to manipulate the situation. It wasn't just the classic ""sorry if you feel bad. This happened in my childhood now apologize to me"" if you had a very good cake on a coffee, she would start to tell you how she can't go out because of this and that, her parents miss treating her, I look fat so going to a coffee is not a good idea and ect. She would make sure to put you down... it was just a hobby for her... I'm not joking it was the only thing that she actually enjoyed.
I got really angry. Because she told me how it's fun when she lies to her therapist and makes them feel they are helping her. Now she's ""healed"" from freaking DID? Someone else did all of it??? Yeah I'm out.
Went no contact a few days ago. As I told you I was angry at first, then I cried a lot but now... I don't feel anything. At some point I actually loved her... but now I wasted all those years on her... she posted a rant on her page about how ""sad and depressed"" she is The only thing I can think of is ""you deserve it""

The Environmental Impact of Modern Home and Kitchen Gadgets: A Sustainable Perspective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The convenience that modern home and kitchen gadgets provide is undeniable. From smart coffee makers to high-tech food processors, these innovations have transformed how we cook and manage our homes. However, with great convenience comes great responsibility, especially when considering their environmental impact. Understanding this impact helps you make better choices that contribute to a sustainable lifestyle.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gadgets  
  
Many of today's kitchen appliances are designed for energy efficiency. For instance, devices like slow cookers and pressure cookers consume less energy than traditional ovens, which can lead to lower electricity bills and reduced carbon footprints. By choosing energy-efficient gadgets, you are investing in a greener home.

- **Energy Efficiency:** Look for appliances that have an Energy Star rating. These products use less energy compared to standard models.
- **Durability:** Choose high-quality gadgets that last longer, reducing the need for frequent replacements.
- **Recyclable Materials:** Opt for products made from materials that can be recycled at the end of their life cycle.

Another aspect to consider is the use of smart technology in home and kitchen gadgets. Smart appliances can often be controlled via a smartphone app, allowing for energy usage monitoring and scheduling. For example, a smart thermostat learns your habits and adjusts accordingly, leading to significant energy savings. Smart cookers can also be programmed to run during off-peak energy hours, further reducing environmental impact.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gadgets  
  
However, it’s not just about energy consumption. The manufacturing of these gadgets can have significant consequences for the environment. Many electronics are produced using materials that are harmful to the planet. This includes the mining of rare earth elements and the use of non-biodegradable plastics. You can help mitigate this impact by choosing products from companies known for their sustainable practices. Look for brands that are committed to reducing waste and employing ethical sourcing methods in their production processes.

Here are some sustainable practices to consider when selecting gadgets:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gadgets  
  
- **Research Manufacturers:** Know the brands that use eco-friendly processes.
- **Read Reviews:** Look for feedback from other users about the brand's environmental practices.
- **Check Certifications:** Ensure products come certified for sustainable practices, like the Sustainable Electronics Initiative.

Recycling is another crucial element in minimizing the environmental effects of home and kitchen gadgets. When an appliance reaches the end of its life, find a local recycling program that handles electronics. Many municipalities now offer electronics recycling bins, making it easier for you to dispose of old gadgets responsibly. By recycling, you reduce waste in landfills and ensure that valuable materials are recovered and reused.

It's also worthwhile to consider the lifecycle of your gadgets. The path from manufacturing to disposal has various environmental impacts. For instance, the packaging is often wasteful and does not decompose easily. You can take small steps to minimize your ecological footprint by requesting minimal packaging when you shop or buying second-hand gadgets. Not only does this reduce demand for new products, but it also gives a new lease of life to existing items.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gadgets  
  
- **Buy Used:** Check websites and local shops for second-hand gadgets that are still in great condition.
- **Focus on Multi-Functional Items:** Select tools that serve multiple purposes to reduce clutter and waste.

Ultimately, being mindful about the gadgets you choose for your home and kitchen can significantly reduce your environmental impact. Prioritizing energy-efficient options, opting for sustainable brands, recycling old appliances, and opting for second-hand products are all steps you can take toward a more sustainable lifestyle. By making these informed choices, you not only improve your home’s efficiency but also contribute positively to the planet’s health.

These practices into your purchasing decisions will not only result in a more eco-friendly kitchen but may also lead to long-term savings. By being conscious of how your gadgets impact the environment, you are part of a crucial movement toward sustainability. The choices you make today will shape the world tomorrow.

### Conclusion

As you explore the world of home and kitchen gadgets, it becomes clear that these innovative tools are not just for convenience; they have the potential to elevate your entire cooking experience. From smart cooking devices that simplify meal preparation to multi-functional gadgets that save both space and time, the right tools can inspire creativity in the kitchen and make cooking enjoyable again. These gadgets bring efficiency and ease, ensuring that even novice cooks can whip up delicious meals with minimal effort.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/home-and-kitchen-gadgets  
  
Yet, it’s also essential to consider the environmental impact of your culinary choices. Many modern gadgets are designed with sustainability in mind, utilizing energy-efficient technologies and materials that help reduce waste. From eco-friendly cooking appliances to reusable tools that cut down on single-use plastics, incorporating these products into your home can significantly lessen your carbon footprint. By choosing gadgets that promote sustainability, you not only enhance your culinary adventures but also contribute to a healthier planet.

By embracing the latest advancements in home and kitchen technology, you give yourself the opportunity to explore new cooking methods while being mindful of the environment. The fusion of innovation and sustainability presents a chance for positive transformation—both in your kitchen and in the world around you. So whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting out, investing in thoughtful gadgets can make a notable difference in your culinary journey and promote a more sustainable lifestyle. Embrace the changes, and watch as your cooking and your home transform into a more efficient and eco-friendly space.

I'm still continuing to notice encouraging little changes. TMI warning: digestion issues. I have had pretty consistent stomach problems for the past 5 or 6 years resulting in uncomfortable gas, bloating, and frequent diarrhea. The best my doctor would tell me is that I likely have IBS. I noticed it a bit last week, but definitely this week that I am more regular than I have been in years! I know a lot of people struggle with constipation on these meds, but apparently it was just what I needed lol. I am still dealing with mild gas every couple days though. Fingers crossed for metformin not to ruin this for me.

Also, my stomach feels softer? I am curious if this is from reduced bloating or inflammation. 

Finally, I noticed that I can no longer handle even small amounts of caffeine. I made the mistake of treating myself to a Dunkin iced coffee around 11 AM and my heart was still racing at bed time. The next day I tried just a small mug of drip coffee and still felt fluttery. That's OK though. The mood boost from the buproprion is definitely worth giving up coffee.

**Background** by /u/Mcilwain22

Mutant Academy is a collective from Richmond, Virginia that’s been at it for a decade now. Their debut has been in the making for a couple years but with backing from Roc Nation Distribution, their debut finally turned a dream to reality. The collective has went through changes (former members Koncept Jackson and producer Tuamie eventually left the group on amicable terms) leaving the group with more producers than rappers. This doesn’t hinder them as rappers Fly Anakin, Big Kahuna OG, and Henny L.O. hold down the fort exceptionally through the project.  The collective boasts an incredible work ethic judging by the numerous solo projects that they have put out for the past 9-10 year. The collective also has underground producer standouts such as Graymatter, Unlucky Bastards(brother to Graymatter, fun fact), ewonee, ohbliv, sycho sid and Foisey. 

The group dropped an EP called Talk Soon a couple months before the release of Keep Holly Alive, which is a nice four track appetizers for listeners who don’t want to jump into a 18 track length project

If you ever decide go down the rabbit hole of the individual rappers in the collective, chances are that you’ll be seeing a lot of the usual suspects with the features and production credits. I’ll give some recommendations in the end

**Review** by /u/Mcilwain22

(iI first got tapped into these guys around 2018 thanks to a close friend (shoutout Ant!). He put me on to a song called Promise from a collaborative project between Fly Anakin, Koncept Jackson and producer Tuamie.

The most interesting aspect about this project is how unified the sounds are through each song while having 6 producers on the project. I don’t know who or how they came up with the sequencing for the album but it seamlessly flows into each track. Every producer manages to bring some of their signature production styles in their songs but without breaking away from the sonic theme of the project. A lot of loops, samples, and crisp drums are thrown into the mix. I enjoyed how ewone got the first three beats on the album, setting the tone for the project. Fly Anakin and Henny L.O. lead off on the project, and it’s apparent that he came to rap his ass off on the project judging by his performance on “Space Time Continuum”. Both him and Anakin trade off verses for the first three songs until Kahuna makes his first appearance at the end of “Space Time Continuum”. Which leads into the middle section of the project being my favorite. The run from “Paranoid” to “Too Accessible” features some of the best beats on here courtesy of Sycho Sid, Unlucky Bastards, and Foisey. “Paranoid” features a beautifully flipped sample from The Internet and all three rappers glide over it. “Rock, Paper, Scissors” might just be the beat that grabs the listener from the beginning and Kahuna, Henny, and Anakin go right into flowing over it. I feel like this middle section represents the more energetic side of the collective as both the beats and raps are more animated. While as the latter half is more hazy and feels like the producers are tapping into more off kilter sounds and sample chops, specifically on songs like “Beam Me Up”, “Liberation”, and “Stay Forever”. Quelle Chris, the album’s lone feature, comes through with a quality verse over a triumphant sounding loop. 

If you need a no frills project with great productions and rappers who can meld their flow on any type of production, then “Keep Holly Alive” is the project for you. I’ve said it before in the DDT’s before, but these guys just REALLY know how to rap. Like that’s the best way I can put it. Big Kahuna OG focuses more on hooks, while Henny L.O has an understated voice and niche ass references (man gets off a Todd Mcfarlane reference in “Rock, Paper, Scissors”) and Fly Anakin is the definition of a rapper’s rapper. He’s not hitting you with many punchlines, but man you could put this man on any beat and he will just make it work. One of the best deliveries in rap today.

I really enjoyed this project and i think it’s a decent jumping point if you want to get into the collective. I chose this album because it’s fun finding that diamond in the rough that you keep championing hoping that they get the attention that they deserve. Everytime I post about one of the members in the group on the daily discussion threads, I get happy when more and more reply about how dope this group is. Shit, go ask the regulars on the DDT’s on what their favorite Fly Anakin project and you’re likely to get about 8 different answers. 

Obligatory go listen to *Chapel Drive*,*Panama Plus*, and *Strainman Chronicles*

First two are collab projects with Koncept Jackson, Fly Anakin, and Tuamie. If you know, you know.

Strainman Chronicles is a collab project with Big Kahuna OG and Graymatter. Don’t sleep. Seriously, it’s a masterwork in production.

I’m interested in making tea lattes at home (and possibly on a larger scale in the future), which require strong tea shots. I’ve noticed that some bubble tea shops, like Chi Cha San Chen, use machines specifically designed for tea extraction. However, I’m wondering if it’s possible to use a standard coffee espresso machine for this purpose, especially using ground tea leaves (not whole loose leaves or tea bags).

Here are my main questions:

	•	Has anyone successfully used a coffee espresso machine to brew tea shots with ground tea leaves? How did you adjust the temperature and timing for the type of tea?
	•	Are there risks of damaging a coffee espresso machine when brewing tea this way (e.g., clogging, residue buildup, or wear and tear)?
	•	Would it be better to invest in a tea-specific machine, and are there any affordable options you’d recommend for brewing tea shots?

I’m asking because I don’t want to invest in an expensive machine without being sure it can handle ground tea leaves and actually produce the strong tea shots I need for tea lattes. I’d love to hear any advice, tips, or experiences!

Thanks so much!

I enjoy conventions, video games, cosplaying, etc. Outside of my cosplay I have a great taste in fashion. I also like to work out to keep in shape and stay healthy. In my spare time I fill out sweepstakes and enter raffles (that I often win!).

I am looking for a woman who I can travel, cosplay(not required), geek out with and eventually share a life with. But for now a coffee, if local, would be great.

1i8iyhu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Botdog/comments/1i8iyhu/your_linkedin_content_strategy_to_drive_sales_in/,Your LinkedIn content strategy to drive sales in 2025 (what's working for our top Botdog users),"Hey r/Botdog users!

I've been chatting with a lot of you recently, as well as following some of you on LinkedIn and looking at your strategies. I also read all 123 pages of [Richard Van Der Blom's LinkedIn Algorithm Report](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardvanderblom_algorithm-insights-2024-report-v10-activity-7160527422398844928-VnlE/) (if you're serious about LinkedIn, it's worth the read - most numbers in this post come from there). Thought I'd share what I've learned, because it's mostly always the same basic advice again and again (it's also inspired from one of our [recent blog posts](https://www.botdog.co/blog-posts/how-to-generate-more-leads-on-linkedin-in-2025-a-complete-guide))

In 2025, if you're in B2B (and increasingly B2C), you're dead without a LinkedIn strategy. It doesn't mean that LinkedIn will drive all your revenue, but you need to have a strategy. Then the results will be proportionate to your effort: if you invest $100/month in tools (cost of LinkedIn Sales Navigator + Botdog) and a few hours here and there, you'll get a few results (mostly the low hanging fruits). Maybe a 10X return on your investment, maybe a few deals per month. 

If you spend 10 hours per week, you'll see a bigger return.

After all, sales is competitive and most big opportunities are immediately arbitraged away :) 

Anyway, here's what actually works to drive sales on LinkedIn:

**Get a paid LinkedIn subscription** (premium or sales navigator) and **max out your weekly connections** (\~150 per week). 

* You can do this manually, or use a LinkedIn automation tool like Botdog (or one of our competitors). Do this, and you'll get an additional 4,000 connections by the end of the year. No quick hack, just slowly building out a valuable asset. Remember: your invitation quote doesn't roll over, so every week that you don't send invites and it's lost forever. 

**Write content to nurture your connections.** 

* Think of it as a newsletter that they didn't even know they subscribed to. Don't aim for viral posts. The people driving actual sales write long-form (1,800-2,000 characters) that solve real problems. Quick heads up: LinkedIn's algorithm hates ChatGPT content. We see 30% reach drops when people just copy-paste. People probably hate it too tbh. Focus on adding value to your audience, and display your expertise. 
* Start with 1-2 posts a week, maybe on stuff you've experienced with your clients. Ideal frequency is 5+ per week. 
* You can use Lead Magnets (Comment ""Interested"" to receive my document!), they're super annoying but it works to drive engagement
* Add images occasionally: +20% reach, but no more than 3 image posts in a row
* Just Connecting's report shows prospects are 70% more likely to see your future content after they've replied to a message, so consistently messaging your prospects (NOT PUSHING YOUR PRODUCT, don't be too insistant) while make you stay top of mind.

**Start conversations.**

* When someone engages with your post, reach out to them. Thank them, ask them questions, engage in a conversation. You can do this manually, or automate. 
* Same thing in the comments section, try and start a conversation. Ask people to share their opinions.
* Comment on 5-10 relevant posts when your post your own (15+ words, avoid ""great post!"", it's filtered out by the algorithm), this will increase your reach

**Take your time and stop overthinking**

* This is very counter-intuitive, but people who see the best results from Botdog are those who take their time. If you're connecting with a person and immediately try to close them on a call, you'll lose them. You first have to start a conversation, get familiar with them. It doesn't mean waiting for 3 years, sometimes a few weeks is all it takes. 
* Forget ""best times to post"" - think about YOUR prospects. Are they (like most people) checking LinkedIn during morning coffee or Lunch break? Then this is when you should post.
* It's not about going viral. It's about becoming a familiar face in your prospects' feed. When they see your content regularly, cold calls turn warm naturally.
* Try to constantly optimize and improve, every week. Small, marginal gains. Try to get a new profile picture, that looks more legit (about that: most AI-generated pictures look very weird and uncanny, it's probably best to use a simple iPhone picture that looks natural). Play with a few different headlines. Improve your profile description. Just: you don't have to do this from the start. 
* The beauty of LinkedIn is that you can measure everything (and use Botdog to measure what's missing in LinkedIn, like connection rate). Look at your post analytics, see which headlines get more clicks, which topics drive more engagement. Your month 3 content will be way better than month 1, and that's the point.
* Fun fact: only 7.1% of LinkedIn's billion users post quarterly. Just doing the basics puts you ahead.

She and I are both regulars at a coffee shop. Every day, we get coffee together and we chat with each other when waiting in line. 

I (30M) was always shy and nervous when talking to women. I never asked anyone out. I decided that one day, I need to get over my fear of rejection and just do it. I need to get over my fears and shyness. I knew she already had a boyfriend because I see him waiting for her outside the shop sometimes. But she never mentioned a boyfriend to me, so (I think) she doesn't know that I know.

A few days ago, I asked her out and she rejected me. She told me that she already had a boyfriend. I said ok and moved on with my life. I told some friends and coworkers about this. Some of them were supportive, but others were telling me that I'm an asshole for asking. I made her reject me and put her in an uncomfortable situation. They also talk about women who are murdered for rejecting men, and they said that I made her fear for her life.

I don't think that's reasonable. Even though I got rejected, I still think this is a huge accomplishment for me because at least I overcame my shyness and asked a woman out. I don't think that merely asking is an assholeish thing to do. Yes, women do get murdered for rejecting men. But you can't just assume the worst from everyone. ",0,1737679437.0,AITAH,13,0.5,False
