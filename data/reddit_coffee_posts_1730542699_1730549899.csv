So, my job search hasn’t been going great lately, and I thought setting up some coffee chats could help me make connections and maybe get some resume advice. But wow, this was another disaster… My second in-person coffee chat, and it just went south. Feeling a bit unlucky these days.

I met this Vietnamese guy on Hinge, and he seemed really nice. We agreed to meet near his office for a coffee chat. Everything started off fine; he was super friendly, and we chatted about work and stuff. Then he offered to look over my resume and give me some pointers, which I thought was awesome… until it wasn’t.

So there’s this one part in my resume about “5000 research data” that, to be honest, I didn’t actually do. It was kind of “polished up” by someone who helped me with my resume. Well, he noticed it and asked where exactly this data came from, and I just blanked… couldn’t answer. Then he got suspicious and asked if I’d actually done that project, and I didn’t know what to say. He seemed pretty annoyed, said if I hadn’t really done it, I should’ve been upfront about it. Then he just stopped going through my resume, said a few polite words, and left.

Looking back, I feel so dumb. That’s twice now that an in-person coffee chat has totally backfired on me. Am I doing something wrong here? Anyone have tips on things to avoid talking about or how to keep it from getting awkward? I feel like I keep hitting these invisible landmines, and I could really use some advice.",2,1730549619.0,unimelb,0,1.0,False

1ghv1c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1ghv1c7/post_covid_anxiety/,Post Covid Anxiety ,"A few years ago, I started getting panic attacks out of nowhere and it was terrifying. It was my first symptom of Peri I now realize. 

My anxiety has been under control for the last 2 years. It creeps in during PMS week, but I manage it pretty well now because I know it will pass.  

Last week I got what I initially thought was food poisoning. I wasn’t throwing up, just stomach pain, bloating and nausea with no appetite. 

Then suddenly I developed a full body rash on the third day. My weird immune system gives me a rash anytime I get a virus ( it’s called a viral exthanthem) so I decided I should test for Covid. It was the faintest positive & I was shocked. I had Covid before & it was all respiratory symptoms. This time, I had no respiratory symptoms whatsoever. 

The week before Covid I was drinking 2 cups of coffee every morning with absolutely no anxiety whatsoever. Now, if I even try to have a sip, my body goes into full panic mode. It’s so weird & feels like I’m shaking internally, my jaw tenses up & I feel like I’m going to pass out. It was so bad yesterday I almost went to the ER. This morning I made a pot of half decaf and it happened again after just a few sips. The other weird thing is any time I eat or drink anything at all, my stomach blows up instantly & I look pregnant.  I could deal with the stomach stuff, but the anxiety is terrifying & I was doing amazing before getting sick. 

Has anyone else had post Covid anxiety? And if so, did it get better with time? I’m scared because it took so long to get my anxiety under control. It’s also weird because it is strictly in my body, not really in my brain (if that makes sense). I know there is a strong mind/gut connection and it does feel like it’s connected to the gut.

Hey, Travel Trotters! If there’s one question that constantly buzzes around these parts, it’s how to see the world without breaking the bank. Traveling on a shoestring doesn’t mean you have to skimp on experiences. From my whirlwind tour of 50 countries, I’ve uncovered five budget-friendly cities where every penny stretches a mile. Whether you’re a seasoned globetrotter or a newbie wanderer, these spots promise adventure, culture, and unforgettable memories—all without the hefty price tag.

**1. Hanoi, Vietnam 🇻🇳**

Vietnam’s capital city, Hanoi, tops the list for its rich history, vibrant street life, and mouthwatering street food—think delicious bowls of pho for less than $2! Whether you're wandering the bustling streets of the Old Quarter or taking in the serene beauty of Hoan Kiem Lake, Hanoi provides a tapestry of culture that doesn’t empty your wallet. Tip: Grab a cup of egg coffee for a caffeine kick with a local twist.

**2. Lisbon, Portugal 🇵🇹**

Lisbon offers a European experience without the typical European price tag. Cobblestone streets, colorful alfama houses, and stunning views from the city’s many miradouros (viewpoints) await. For fantastic, budget-friendly eats, dive into a bacalhau dish or pastel de nata. Don’t forget to use the cheap yet charming tram rides to navigate the city’s steep hills.

**3. Krakow, Poland 🇵🇱**

With a lively nightlife, a historic Old Town, and stunning medieval architecture, Krakow is remarkably affordable. The city’s cultural depth is vast—think the Wieliczka Salt Mine and Auschwitz Museum—with entry fees easier on the pocket than you’d expect. Pro tip: The city is famed for its pierogi, and many places offer tasting menus that are kind to your budget.

**4. La Paz, Bolivia 🇧🇴**

High up in the Andes, La Paz offers a unique blend of culture, adventure, and affordability. The city is unlike any other with its dramatic landscapes, bustling marketplaces, and vibrant street festivals. Navigating its fascinating alleyways is cheap, and public transport won't set you back either. Try the local fare such as salteñas (meat pastries) for an authentic taste.

**5. Budapest, Hungary 🇭🇺**

Often dubbed the ""Paris of the East,"" Budapest fuses romance with affordability. Stroll along the Danube, soak in the thermal baths, or explore the grand architecture—all while enjoying surprisingly low prices for accommodation and food. Make sure to savor some goulash before leaving!

First things first, I am currently in separation from my twin and it’s the deepest separation yet, no talking for over two months, no plans to speak again, last convo ended on a serious disagreement in which I finally stuck up for myself and rejected him wholeheartedly and he blocked me and I can say without doubt I do not care (yes I know this sounds delusional and insane as even a year ago this would have torn my soul to shreds) but conversely to not caring I also have never been more sure that we are connected and when I say sure I don’t mean obsessive thinking or any of the experiences we all have in relation to our twin I mean I feel it in my body, its kind of like a deep knowing. I don’t even think about it anymore, I just know. I am not going to pretend I know how to get your twin back or even imply that’s what you should be doing, in fact I actively promote not trying to do so if you are the DF but again I’m not in union and not claiming I know what’s right for twins, just what’s been good for myself 

I am more than aware this makes me look and sound like I belong in a looney bin but the peace and safety I feel within myself and consequent changes that have been made to myself since this exchange have been some of the best parts of the journey yet, I am no longer putting bad things into my body and I am no longer allowing people to take from me emotionally without checking in with myself to see if it’s for my highest good. I’ve learnt more about myself in the past 2 months than I have on the whole journey 😭

My journey has been long and I have had every insecurity under the sun, I was orphaned at a young age (24) and the lack of direction in knowing how to love myself or put trust in others not to abandon me was huge. I was someone who turned to drugs and alcohol and pretty much did anything I could to avoid how I was feeling at any given moment. I had no idea how to self love and mostly I had no trust in myself even when I thought I knew what to do so I would flip flop on direction in life 

Enter twinnie - like everyone here, my twin entered into my life not long after the death of my mum and I had an instant connection with him that was unlike anything I’ve ever experienced and spent years going in circles as to why he didn’t want me and why he would treat me the way he did and keep coming back and keep hurting me, blah blah rinse and repeat

I was forced into deep self healing in the end because I really had no choice, I felt like complete and utter crap daily and when I tried to avoid it, it truly felt like the universe would knock on my door and say erm nope, wrong direction, keep going within, and everytime I thought I’d gone deep enough I realised there was a whole new layer to uncover and as above, rinse and repeat 

I believe without a shadow of a doubt that if you are a twin then you will have no choice but to do this, especially as the DF. You have been woken up first for a reason. You are the leader of this journey, and by that I do not mean go and chase your twin and try and wake them up although interestingly you (like I did) may feel led to do this until you exhaust the possibility of this working. This journey appears to be about balancing masculine and feminine energy within YOURSELF. My DM definitely reflected back to me everywhere I was not being my true self or acting on my highest excitement. I wasn’t even being honest with him because I feared he would leave. 

This concept I attribute to Bashar (not scientific so mods may not allow this bit but I would hugely recommend you watch some of his vids) 

Why are we choosing to do things we do not prefer? Why are we chasing our twins when we want them to chase us? I know for myself it’s because I feared they would not turn round and come back to me. Why did that scare me? Because if they don’t then that will mean we are not connected and I was infact delusional all along 😂 and why did that scare me? Because I would have wasted so much time… finding out who I truly was? 👀 oh wait, what a perfect way to spend my time 

Twins can be toxic at best when unhealed and mine truly was the clearest reflection of where I needed to love myself more and once you grasp this concept you will get healthier, love yourself more, love others more, and just allow people to be where they are at in their journey/life and trust that this for their highest good no matter what it appears to you. If it’s triggering you then it’s for YOUR highest good 😂 helping you look inside and ask, wait a sec, why is this triggering me? Why am I judging people who are choosing what is best for them in this moment? For me this was absolutely because I Infact was not doing that for myself. 

I really recommend meditating if you don’t do this yet and would point you in the direction of Natural Mystic and Innermeenergetics on TikTok because their content is amazing around the twin journey. The latter is a DM documenting his journey and the former a DF. (Again not scientific but may help some people) 

Some of the content won’t resonate at first unless you are at a certain stage in your healing and journey and that’s okay, if it was supposed to resonate then it would and if it doesn’t it’s not for your highest good at this moment, I’ve had times I’ve come back to a video months later and it’s like a penny has dropped due to the experiences I’ve had in the meantime 😂 

I really recommend focusing your energy on connecting with your higher self and intuition and just building a strong connection and belief in yourself and your own experiences rather than looking externally for validation. Though both can be comforting the inside connection really needs to come first before the outside will resonate. 

In contrast to the above you will not do that until you are ready to do that and your life will tell you when you are so do not worry if you can’t focus on these things because you’re too obsessed with your twin. I hope the message is coming through at this point 😂 it doesn’t matter the path you take to your checkpoints because they will always be presented to you at the right point in time and you will be excited to follow them when the time is right, if you’re not then you still have something to learn from the experience you’re currently going through, even if it’s painful or something you do not prefer… again, there will be a belief somewhere within you that in order to let go of what you do not prefer you would infact NOT gain what you do. Sit back, relax and ENJOY YOUR JOURNEY. So many of us are so obsessed with union we just forget to watch the sun rise and set and appreciate what we’ve learnt thus far! Life is for living and has a funny way of taking us where we need (not want) to go. Make this journey yours and just allow and appreciate what comes to you along the way. 

Anyway, I hope this is helpful and doesn’t go against guidelines and if you managed to read this far then thank you and hope you all have a fab weekend! ✨🫶🤍

1ghuney,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ghuney/scared_to_make_a_move_on_my_crush/,Scared to make a move on my crush!!,"I moved into the area a year ago. I wanted to meet my neighbors, but I was too scared to knock on the door next door as a car was never there until late in the evenings like after 10.30pm so I left a card and candy to introduce myself. My neighbor knocked on my door a few days later in response and we had a nice chat. He seemed really nice and I invited him in after a few minutes of chatting at the door for coffee but he said he had to go but would call another time. 

He is very good looking and I know he is single as he uses dating apps. We have similiar hobbies and backgrounds and I feel if I could have a good conversation with him we could see whether there is potential there. I have developed a massive crush on him and from my side would very much like to see if there could be any potential. He regularly appears on them and then seems to delete them again after a short space of time. I have once swiped right on him as I wanted to make a move (id prefer it to happen naturally when he is next door) but while it didn't come up as a match, this was after months of seeing him on there. So he could have previously swiped on me and we wouldn't have matched then either as I wouldnt have swiped right on him at that point and then he has regularly deleted and reset.

I rarely see him as he seems to leave later or earlier than me in the mornings and comes home at different times. So it's hard to accidently on purpose bump into him. When I pass him in the car he always waves.

He had someone in painting his garden fence a few months ago and that gave me the idea about a month later I should do mine so I did. Then he put a prompt on a dating app that he is looking for someone who likes painting garden fences. Co incidence or just referring to himself? And like a day later he disappeared again from the apps. (Only to later come back with new prompts).

I feel like I really want to make a move or something. I'm scared to knock on his door and can't think of any excuse and I'm scared I will annoy him or he is not interested. People that know him described him to me as shy and unassuming. And I know people will say it's risky when he is the neighbor but I don't want to regret what I didn't try.
If I ask him to help me move furniture upstairs is that strange? That's all I can think of... and I'm scared to knock on the door and ask!! Help!!

I decide I might as well fuel up and grab a coffee while I'm at it. So I pull up the the pump (this is NJ by the way) and the gas attendant is already waiting there for me. I ask him to fill it up with diesel, he swipes my card, and I run inside to grab a coffee. I come back outside a few minutes later and as I get closer to my truck I see the black pump in my truck and I see the green pump still hung up on the gas pump. At that point I'm already getting angry and in disbelief until the gas  attendant says, ""I F@#$% UP DIDNT I?"" I look and see he pumped 15 gallons of regular gas in the truck. I lose my cool for a second but the manager comes out and tells me that they would call a tow and have it towed to a mechanic of my choosing. So I wait about an hour and a half fir this tow company to show up and the tow truck driver was clearly not experienced. I told him that the truck was filled with gas and cannot be started. I was adamant about putting the truck into neutral myself because I didn't want some idiot to accidentally start it considering it's push to start. So he pulls the truck up onto the flat bed, and I have a ride at that point so we follow the tow truck to the dealership. As we arrive he drops truck in the service area and at this point I'm kinda up his ass because I don't want him touching my truck any further. We'll guess what, he decided to roll the window up for me and has his foot on the brake, (rumble noise) he starts the truck up. I start yelling at him to turn the truck off and he starts panicking and turns the truck off. At this point I am livid because there was no harm done prior to him accidentally starting the truck up. So now I'm sitting here wondering if there was any damage to the engine, how much it's gonna cost, and if wawa actually makes right by this like they said. I have no problem going the lawsuit route if I have to but I just know that process is not easy or timely. ",6,1730547979.0,Cummins,2,0.88,False

Hey coffee enthusiasts!

For this latest bag, I brew coffee for myself using a 15g dose with 250g of water, grinding at 95 clicks on my Kingrinder K6. Each click is apparently 16 microns, totaling roughly 1,520 microns.

However, when I scale up to a 30g dose and 500g of water, I find that using the same grind setting leads to over-extraction, even with the same pouring techniques.

I'm looking for a formula or rule of thumb to estimate the required grind size when increasing the dose. I’d like to avoid constant dialling in, as it quickly depletes my coffee stash.

Would a higher dose indeed require a coarser grind? Any insights or tips would be greatly appreciated!

“Good morning, Tessa!” My wife wrapped her arms around me from behind. She was cold to the touch, but her skin was as soft as ever.



“What are you doing up, Beth? The sun doesn’t set for thirty minutes.”



“I missed you! Besides, all the windows are painted black. I’ll be fine.”



She had barely finished her sentence when I heard a crash, and then a sound like bacon frying. Someone threw a rock through our window, and the sunlight poured in, burning Bethany. She had to sprint out of the room.



“Are you okay, Beth?”



“I’m already healing. It just startled me.”



I looked out the broken window and saw a group of protestors with picket signs.



*Vampires offend God!*



*Dead should stay Dead!*



*Repent or burn in Hell!*



Our house was the only one on the block with blackened windows. It was obvious a vampire lived here.



“Beth, go back to your coffin until the sun sets. I’m gonna talk to our guests.”



“Be careful.”



I walked down the driveway to the protestors and said, “Y’all need to leave.”



“The sidewalk is public property.” The leader of the protestors stepped forward, a mean-looking man with no chin, just a long neck that went right up to his bulbous, buzzed head. “Besides, we’re here to help you. Vampires are an affront to God—”



“Adrenocortical Carcinoma,” I interrupted his preaching.



“Excuse me,” the bulbous man said.



“Cancer of the adrenal glands. Stage four. Terminal. Becoming a vampire saved her life, but you could care less about that, right?”



“My sweet child, I know it’s hard to understand, but God gave your sister cancer because he wanted her dead.”



I couldn’t help but laugh.



“Sister? That’s my wife, you idiot.”



He breathed in deep and spat in my face.



“The only thing worse than a vampire-fucker is a *gay* vampire-fucker.”



“Okay, “ I said, wiping away his disgusting spit, “I’m calling the police.”



Before I could get my phone out something hit me in the head from behind.



I woke up staring up at the moon. My head was in Bethany’s lap, and her wrist was in my mouth. Something cold and metallic was on my tongue, but it tasted sweet like melted ice cream.



“Are you okay?” Bethany pulled back her bloody wrist, and when I closed my mouth I accidentally bit my lip.



“Ow,” I said, running my tongue across my teeth.



Fangs. I had fangs now.



“Baby, what did you do?” I asked.



“Your skull was split, it was the only way I could think to save you. You’re not mad are you?”



“Not at you. Never at you.”



“You’re probably hungry,” Bethany said, “I’ve got some donated blood in the fridge.”



I couldn’t stop thinking about the protestors. What monsters they were. How badly I wanted to take them out.

This was a big move as I have been working remote since before Covid almost 20 years.  As part of being hybrid I am required to  be in an office location 3 days a week.  The main office where I go more frequently is on top of a factory where they do injection molding so sometimes it just stinks.  It reminds me of the office grey walls lots of grey and outdated office furniture.  They try to make it nice but this is not free snacks and pinball games.  Once a month free coffee..

Aside from that, I was just starting to like my job after 4 months.  People are friendly no harsh unrealistic KPIs, no idiotic lattice systems, workday is only used for the basics, overall no bay area type politics.  

I was told that starting in 2025 all people managers are now required to be in the office full time.  And that all individual contributors can continue working hybrid but it would change for them too very soon.

To be in the office full time will most likely mean I have to move to cut down the commute which is an hour each way.  In addition to increasing my driving this totally messes up my lifestyle and my families life too.  I enjoy working at home and virtual work. Kids will have to go to different schools..

As they say honestly I think I am going to have to look for other work while maintaining my current gig.  

This CEO decision will affect 100s of lives.  It will also bring inequity because I am positive that they will make exceptions for some as most of the people living abroad and in California work remote full time.

This company has several manufacturing plants so I am not totally surprised as their is no WFH or hybrid roles for those workers.

Anyway... I will most likely be hitting the pavement again.  Any advice or ideas?  Do you think I can ask for an exception? 

Ultimately to me it shows the power of employers over how we live in the US.   They can force their ideology.  I find it draconian and sad, anti progress.   Thank you for any ideas.",1,1730547254.0,WorkReform,0,1.0,False

Anyway. Ayon nag-commit na ako sa fam ko na makakasama ako sa vacation namin sa province siguro one week before yung break. Pero biglang may mga deadlines na binigay sa resume ng class. Hindi ko na mabawi na ayoko sumama kasi ibig sabihin non hindi na sila tutuloy, magagalit yung isang kapatid ko sakin sasabihin na naman na “kontrabida” ako. Ako naman, pwede naman sila tumuloy na wala ako, I can stay naman sa dorm. May mga instances na kasi before na sa fam namin parang ako yung “kontrabida” sa mga gala na hindi ako makkasama kasi yung course ko which is “arki” marami tlgang workloads. 

So sumama na ako. I really TRIED my best to organize my responsibilities as a student and daughter at the same time. Kasi, as much as possible I want to balance life and study and I’m pretty sure I’m doing it the best way I can. 

And then ayon na nga, pupunta kmi ng mall. So sabi ko what if dalin ko laptop ko para kahit maggala sila ako tambay na lang sa coffee shop para kahit papaano makisama ako, alam ko na kasi mga sasabihin nila sakin if ever mag-paiwan ako sa bahay, yan ka na naman, “kj” or what. Tapos biglang sinabihan ako na “bakit dadalin ko laptop ko akala ko ba maggagala? Wala ka kasing diskarte.” THAT HIT ME HARD.

Anyway, if this is non-sense okay lang hahahha gusto ko lang malaman kung valid ba feelings ko or should I communicate my feelings better.

","I've done that stop for 2 months, fall off the wagon, stop for 2 weeks, did stoptober which lasted a couple of days. Needless to say, this is not going very well. 

The smoking book (easyway). I used to smoke hash (I'm that old) when I was at 6th form. I then used to smoke the tobacco after running out of hash and got addicted to smoking. I used to properly smoke. Get up, have a coffee and a cigarette, drive to work, have a cigarette. Have break (teacher) walk off site, have a smoke, lunchtime, the same, get in the car at 3pm and light up. Go to the pub with my mate smoke smoke smoke. 

Once I ran out of money and I had to read the book. I sat in the shed with a kettle, some milk and coffee. I read it cover to cover and 3/4 of the way thought, I was just like ""I don't smoke anymore"". It was a revelation. I just haven't smoked since. I am still a smoker, even though I haven't had a cigarette in 15 years. All it takes would be one, then the occasional one, then the wake up coffee and cigarette pattern. I think you have got one go at the smoking book and it will 100% work, but it probably won't work a second time. 

I lost my job (not drinking related) and I need to get a grip. Drinking in the evenings has become quite a thing again. Yesterday, I got my fast car out and went for a blast to the city, I parked up and went and bought 2 books. How to ADHD (because I am living by myself and currently in task paralysis!) and the Allen Carr stop drinking. 

I'm going to have a few beers tonight per usual, but tomorrow, I'm going down the shed with a box of tins and I'm going to read the drinking book cover to cover. 

I hope it's like the smoking book.

I will come back on here after I've read it and tell you how I got on. 

As with the smoking book, you have to read it cover to cover (I think). Your addict brain doesn't really want you to read it. But you have to. My mate is still smoking years on and it's as simple as he doesn't really want to stop. He was the one who lent me the smoking book.

I could use some advice here. I've been dating my girlfriend, A, for about three months, and it’s been an amazing relationship from the start. I am her first boyfriend. She’s always had high standard and i had to prove myself for months before she accepted to go on dates with me. 
A is one of those girls who lights up any room she’s in—she’s gorgeous, outgoing, always smiling, and she has this easy, friendly vibe that people are instantly drawn to. She’s also incredibly loyal and caring, the type to always put in effort and make sure I know how much she values me.




She just started her first real job a couple of months ago. She’s young, so she didn’t finish her degree yet, but somehow she still landed this great role at a firm with some really impressive clients. She’s proud of the opportunity, and she’s told me more than once how much she loves the work and the “tight-knit” team atmosphere. Most of her colleagues are older—starting from about 28 or so, and most of them are men, successful, confident, and, well, the type of guys I know she could be into. I don’t blame them for noticing her; she’s one of those people who just stands out, and she always puts a lot of effort into her appearance, great outfits, perfect hair, always on point with makeup. She’s always looked good, but now that she’s in this work environment, it’s like she’s found another level, and I know it doesn’t go unnoticed.



Two weeks ago, she invited me to come with her to a big company event. I thought it’d be fun to meet her colleagues, especially since she spends most of her time with them, and I was curious to see what her work life was really like. The party itself was fancy—formal attire, lots of people, all talking and mingling with drinks in hand. 
Seeing her in that context, surrounded by these guys who were all so obviously taken with her, was… intense.

As soon as we arrived, she was swarmed by colleagues, mostly men. She introduced me as her boyfriend, but it felt like they barely acknowledged me before focusing all their attention back on her. I’m not exaggerating when I say they were practically lining up to talk to her, and she handled it all so smoothly, like she was used to being the center of attention. She’d lean in, laugh, lightly touch their arms—she just had this natural way of engaging that kept them hooked. Some of them even looked like me in a way, same build, that “gym guy” look, so I know they’re exactly her type. And I couldn’t ignore the feeling that I was surrounded by a bunch of guys who might be into her in the exact same way I was.




There were some female colleagues around too, but they didn’t linger or try to pull her aside the way the guys did. And every time one of her male coworkers finished talking with her, another one would step in. It was relentless, and honestly, she seemed to be thriving on it. I know she’s naturally bubbly and friendly, but seeing it on this level, in real time, just kind of hit me. 




After the event, we went back to my place, and she was already all over me before we’d even left the parking lot. She was kissing me with this intensity that felt… different. It’s not unusual for her to be passionate or turned on, but since starting this job, her libido has shot through the roof. She’ll finish work, call me on her way over, and be practically purring on the phone, telling me how much she wants me and how she’s been thinking about it all day. When she finally gets to my place, she’s all over me within seconds, and it’s gotten so intense that I’ve started to wonder if her new energy is coming from somewhere else. I can’t shake the idea that maybe the attention she’s getting at work is carrying over into our relationship.



Some of her colleagues have already started inviting her out to dinners or bringing her little things, like coffee, snacks, or even the occasional small gift. She told me one guy brought her a cake as a “thank you” for helping him out with a client issue. She just laughs it off and says they’re a close team, but I don’t know—it feels a little… extra.
I am absolutely terrified cause they will have a xmas party next month and they will spend time after work together. drinks will be involved. 



I tried to talk to her about it a few days after the party. I didn’t want to come off as insecure, so I tried to keep it casual, just saying that it looked like some of the guys at work were really into her. She listened patiently and then smiled, reassuring me that it wasn’t like that. She said she doesn’t see her colleagues that way, that they’re just work friends, and they’re all super professional. She even told me, “I get that it might look different from the outside, but I’m telling you, it doesn’t mean anything to me.” She explained that she has to be social, that it’s part of her job to keep good relationships, especially because she’s handling client issues on the phone with these people all day. She was so calm and mature about it that I felt a bit silly for bringing it up.




But the weird part is, even though she explained it well and was totally understanding, I still can’t shake this feeling. Every day after work, she’s more turned on, more intense with me, and I keep thinking about the guys I saw at the party, how some of them have the same look, the same vibe. I feel like I’m losing my grip on what’s real and what’s just in my head. It’s been two weeks since the event, and I still can’t stop thinking about it.



She’s genuinely the most attentive and thoughtful girlfriend I could ask for. She makes time for me, comes over even after a long day, plans dates, and checks in throughout the day. She’s gone out of her way to show me that I’m important to her. But the way she’s acting now, always so charged up right after work, it just feels off, like there’s an undercurrent of something I can’t quite put my finger on. I trust her, but I don’t know how to interpret all these changes.



She has always been overly sexual, she is pure passion, but it just keeps growing and growing and i don’t understand… Its just a bit weird. Normal people are tired after work, but she is really energized, and super active. I am happy i am her first thought as soon as she gets in her car and i love hearing her say she cant wait to be at my place and that she feels the physical need to feel me, but i cant help but feel like something’s off. 


I really do think she enjoys these mens attention, and she absolutely loves flirting and by the time her workday is over, she’s in that specific mood because of these guys. 



Something i also cant stop thinking about, is something she told me when we started dating and something that sometimes comes up in our intimacy. I dont want to hold that against her now because of this situation, but i can at least admit here that i’ve been thinking about it. When talking about our k1nks, she has told me she has always had this fantasy of being shared and being with multiple men and all of that. She has many k1nks that i also enjoy, but this is the only one i am not into and idk, it keeps haunting me ever since i saw her at that work event, surrounded by men. 



If these guys were comfortable flirting with her when i was right her or just behind her with her best friend, how are they behaving when they are alone with her? I know my gf, she has a certain energy about her, i know guys are into her. Besides her obvious attractiveness and her being overly feminine in every way, she has this very flirty natural energy, its just the way she is. And i know men are generally into it, i myself have been obsessed with her since i laid eyes on her. + Now that i’ve met her colleagues, now that i’ve seen the type of guys they are…. how they behaved and everything, i know they like her. I know she is exactly their type. I can see the similarities between us and more than anything i saw the lust and interest they expressed or tried to hide….


I don’t know if i am being paranoid. I am worried about it. I cant stop thinking about that party, her team, how they behaved… I can’t stop being terrified something will happen at work. 




It’s confusing, and I don’t want to be the insecure boyfriend who can’t handle her success or confidence. I am not insecure, or else i wouldn’t be with her. I like her for who she is, its what turns me on about her the most, but what i saw at that party, i just cant get over it. I tried to talking to her but it didn’t help. I am not sure on how to act. 

But I also don’t want to ignore something that might be right in front of me. 




She has been getting male attention her whole life, and i have witnessed many things in these months of dating, this isn’t something new to me per say, but the way this is going on, is different. She is with these people every day, for 9 hours. Sometimes 10. Its just different. I hope my concern isn’t seen as me just being jealous, cause i never was. Like i said, i am used to guys hitting on her. We go out all the time, this isn’t something that bothers me. But this situation is DIFFERENT. 


Is this all in my head, or could there be more to it? Honest advice is much appreciated.

———————————————-

ANYWAYS.

My first time in a locked psychiatric ward around 2011 involved my clothing being vetted for methods of self-harm, but I was otherwise allowed to keep it. 

I recently (April 2020 - yes. I KNOW.) immigrated and, due to being an out-group immigrant by both the dominant culture and the local immigrant community n’ whatnot, I’m experiencing a lot of forced psychiatric interventions that, after finally getting through to them, I think we all agree were unnecessary. 

Nuts, huh?

Anyway, the new place makes all their psych patients wear hospital gowns and I’m watching a lot of medical Reels on Facebook that suggest that the States has also switched to making psych patients wear [paper] clothing that isn’t their own.

As someone whose LIFELONG PTSD was initiated by some nurses telling me to step into “a magical dress that would make [me] all better again” that turned out to be a papoose restraint with head immobilization as well, I have a particular aversion to being forced to wear anything in medical situations, but I feel that everyone feels a certain loss of dignity, too. 

*What changed? Why can’t psych patients who are already going through so much psychologically not have any semblance of normality nor dignity?*

I respect that y’all might need some accessibility for booty juice, aka B-52 bombs, but that’s feasible without the paper/hospital gowns.

**Other**
The parking lot at the corner of Mill St. and Short St. has recent modifications to it adding bollards and slender vertical poles at the entrances/exits, which are fine.  However, this week, the owner has added more vertical poles in the center of all 3 entrances/exits making it difficult to maneuver in and out especially trying to avoid people walking.  People with trucks and SUVs have a hard time getting past them and turning the way the arrows are shown on the ground.  When these entrances/exits got smaller from the bollards and poles installed on the outside, drivers could still get in and out using most of the lane if needed for the vehicle size.  Now, the entrances are so narrow that it's like driving into a parking space, and I've seen the poles scrape the sides of 2 different trucks.  I don't believe with the addition of these center poles the entrances/exits are code compliant.  The owner could be liable for any damages done to vehicles (especially larger ones) trying to maneuver between the poles.  It is not very often that cars are entering and existing at the exact same time, and if it does happen, people can be respectful as we've always done and allow one person at a time.  We would hate to have to switch parking lot monthly memberships because of possible damages to vehicles.

Need advice.,"I've been living in the Temple area the last 5 years, but it's time for a career change. I've applied for a few jobs up and down Texas. Georgetown is in the lead by a wide margin, so I started looking around for places to live and things to do, as I've never spent time in GTown apart from traveling down for interviews. So here's really what I'm looking for:

-Best places to live? Looking to rent for the next 2 years minimum. Looking at houses, as I've spent the last 10 years living in apartments. 3 bed at a minimum, prefer 4 as my son will visit and my new bride and I are planning on having children. Budget is no more than 3k a month but I'd like to stay under $2500.

-Rental agencies to use, rental agencies to stay away from?

-Things to do? Is there a lot to do in the area, or do people travel to RR/PVille/Austin? Specifically, I play men's and coed softball 3x a week, my wife plays league volleyball 3x a week. Any good leagues for either around the area?

-Food/Culture? I've already been given the ""You HAVE to try the food and beer at Wahlburg German Restaurant!"" I was stationed in Bavaria for a few years and my wife regularly traveled to Germany through her job, so German food, and especially German beer, are near and dear to us (Still on a search to find the best hefeweizen in Texas). Apart from that, I love Spanish food, and my wife and I love Italian food, as well as good coffee. We like little mom and pop places over big chains. So what's there to eat and drink around GTX??

-I know it's a long shot for Central Texas but I'm a hunter, deer and bird, rifle/shotgun. What are the closest areas for hunting deer or bird? I know that might get me laughed out of here, but worth a shot to ask. Also an avid shooter, any outdoor ranges in the area? Any ranges running IPSC/USPSA/IDPA/2-3 gun competitions in the area?

I'm not opposed to traveling to try new things in the surrounding area, I'm definitely used to driving a lot. But I prefer to keep it local if I can help it. However, I figured I'd come straight to the source to find some answers to my questions. So any little bit of guidance/advice helps! Thank you fine folks in advance, I look forward to joining the communities of Georgetown!",3,1730546067.0,georgetowntx,2,1.0,False
1ghu4j2,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ghu4j2/today_was_rough/,Today was rough,"Today was a rough one. It started with a heated argument with my sister first thing in the morning. Even though it didn’t last long, and we apologized, the words we threw at each other will linger much longer. Then I went to work, only to cross paths with someone I’m not particularly fond of. Let’s just say our interactions always feel forced and fake—a long story that’s not even worth getting into. It had been a year since I’d last seen them, and I was left feeling interrogated, called out by someone who’s never even tried to know me. So why should I feel obligated to give them any answer?

Later, I stayed late at work and was handed a huge cup of coffee that sent my anxiety through the roof. I was questioned, I was monitored, and I could barely function as I battled the fogginess from the caffeine-fueled anxiety. I ended up crying in the theater, alone up in the balcony where no one could see me, and again on the train. I even tried to cry near a fountain at night, sitting there trying to make sense of things—what’s wrong with me, or why life can be so strange. But no tears came; I just felt exposed, vulnerable, watching cars pass by.

When I finally got home, I broke down and let it all out. Now I’m lying here, typing this out. For a moment, I thought I’d lost this whole paragraph after accidentally deleting it in my notes app, but luckily, I had it copied here. I’m exhausted, defeated, and I regret reaching out to a coworker while having a major episode. Today was not my day.",1,1730546017.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False
1ghu4aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigsupportgroup/comments/1ghu4aw/started_submitting_too_much_to_my_friend_unsure/,"Started submitting too much to my friend, unsure of how to proceed. ","I never thought I would be in the position to talk about an experience like this but here goes. 

Me and G became friends because of mutual friends. G is the same age as me, Asian, and works a corporate job. I work in tech. G is a hard worker and is determined to save up and has monetary goals and is paid decent. Being in tech has allowed me to make a good amount but I am stingy and don’t spend on myself as much. I have submitted to folks on twitter before but had gotten bored of it. 

When I met G i had a slight crush on her. It never went anywhere but I did notice that she would use me as an emotional fallback whenever she felt alone but as soon as she had a “potential” guy the messages would stop coming in as frequently. Honestly I was fine with getting whatever attention I received from her whenever. Over the past 2 years we have talked anywhere between 24/7 to once a week. We got super close and she would rely on me to help make decisions for her.

All this culminated into us constantly pushing boundaries, getting drunk together until I confessed my feelings to her and she said she doesn’t feel the same. I thought that was fair. but we kept being great friends. She would rely on me to help her make life decisions wnd message me all the time and that continued. But also, somehow that rejection developed into submissive feelings for me.

It started by us joking how if I got rich I would buy her a mustang and a manor because she deserves the best. Then we kept pushing it more until I started paying for her coffee in the morning just because. I was very into it to the point that she would text me the coffee emoji and I would pay for it before she was handed the coffee.

She started vaguely mentioning how my top 3 hobbies include worshipping her (which was honestly true) and I started asking to pay for more stuff. Initially she was hesitant and refused but at some point we broke past all that.

I moved out of the city but we still texted every day and kept our dynamic. I totalled my sends to her in the past 3 months, and we are at 824$. That’s wild and I find it hot. I helped pay for her food on vacation, got her volleyball shoes, and even more. It felt very rewarding. I even paid for some of her hinge subscription and she remarked “That’s wild you’re literally paying for me to find out a dude to become my BF”. I know you guys will get a kick out of that one because I did. I even got her to agree to a payment plan to fund her big ticket items so I her for weeks. Our own version of Klarna, afterpay. 

But this is where things get meg. Partly needing some more validation from her, since the dynamic is very vanilla, i would write paragraphs of how much this means which she just responds with a sentence, not really playing along. She still lets me pay for her stuff. But i gotta ask her. and we are less friends than before. I acted too desperate and needy for a bit and I think it put her off. She doesn’t send me the friend messages any more. Partly it also has to do with the fact that I moved out to a different city. But that has made the dynamic feel more transactional than worshipping-y? I also really wanted to take her to vacation to a 5 star resort and sleep on the couch while she got the bed, which she was a maybe on, but changed to a no recently which I was pretty sad about.


I am not sure how to proceed so I have decided to give her some space and let her approach me first in terms of messages? What do you guys think. sorry for the wall of text. ",3,1730545986.0,paypigsupportgroup,4,1.0,False

There I was, trapped under my old breast pump like some sort of milk-producing hostage, wondering if I could train my cat to bring me snacks. Then I tried out the Momcozy M5, and suddenly I remembered what having hands felt like. 

Here's what happened.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

At 230g, it's lighter than my phone addiction and about as discreet as a breast pump can be. 

My first thought was, finally, something that doesn't make me look like I'm working as a dairy factory. Although the ""baby mouth"" design had me skeptical – I mean, who names these things? – but to be fair, it actually works.

# Key Features

**Stealthy:** My old pump sounded like a small construction site, but this M5 is quieter than my mother-in-law's passive-aggressive compliments about my parenting. The micro-vibration technology means you can actually pump during calls without people thinking you're operating heavy machinery in the background.

**Triple Modes:** It gives you 3 modes (stimulation, expression, and mixed) and nine levels. The mixed mode is pretty clever – it's basically interval training for your boobs. The stimulation mode kicks things off like a gentle warm-up, the expression mode is where the magic happens, and the mixed mode keeps things interesting. I can customize it more than my coffee order.

**The Fit Factor:** Four flange sizes (17/19/21/24mm) mean you're not stuck with the one size approach that most pumps offer. Finding the right fit for me was less complicated than choosing what to watch on Netflix. The double-sealed flange with that ergonomic breast arc design is also excellent. It's like someone finally realized breasts aren't perfectly circular cookie cutters.

**Stylish:** Who knew a breast pump could be... dare I say it... stylish? The quill gray color and compact design mean it doesn't scream ""I'M PUMPING!"" to everyone within a 50-foot radius. The included storage bag is actually cute enough to pass as a regular accessory. It's like the pump equivalent of those yoga pants that can pass as regular pants – practical but still socially acceptable.

**The Tech Specs:** The battery life is impressive. A full charge lasts through multiple sessions, unlike my patience for unsolicited parenting advice. The USB-C charging is neat because it means one less specialized cable to lose in the black hole that is my diaper bag. The pump remembers your preferred settings, which is more than I can say for my sleep-deprived brain most days.

# Pros

* Freedom to actually use your hands (crazy, I know)
* Comfortable enough to forget you're wearing it (yes, really)
* Surprisingly efficient milk extraction
* Quiet operation (my sleeping baby doesn't know I'm restocking their food supply)
* Actually portable, not ""portable if you have a sherpa"" portable

# Cons

* The rounded bottom means it's as stable as a toddler on a sugar rush
* Multiple parts to clean (though still better than being tethered to a wall)

# Final Thoughts

The Momcozy M5 is a pretty good option for moms who want to maintain their sanity while maintaining their milk supply. It's also good for working moms, multitaskers, and anyone who's tired of being chained to their traditional pump like it's 1999. 

But if you're looking for the cheapest option or hate charging devices, this might not be for you. After using it for several weeks, I can confidently say it's changed my pumping game entirely. I'm no longer planning my entire day around pumping sessions or apologizing for ducking out of meetings to go milk myself like a dairy cow.

After our last interaction (2 weeks ago) I felt that she became colder again and didn't reply to my messages anymore. I went back to no contact for 2 weeks. 

A few days ago I contacted her, asking if she was willing to hang out next weekend. She agreed and we had dinner at my place, watched a movie and things felt very natural and familiar.

I asked her if she's available friday night, to which she replied that she's going to a wine exhibition with a male colleague from her new workplace. Since we're not together anymore, I didn't feel like I had the right to ask who he is and what his intentions are etc.

The wine exhibition in our city closes at 11PM, so at around 10 PM I texted her asking if everything is going good, she didn't reply. I was a bit worried since he's practically a stranger to her (she only started working there a month ago).

Howard Marks (Oaktree) has written a book called ""The Most Important Thing"", where he basically outlines 20 more or less important things about investing. One of his observations is, that people like to ignore all other potential outcomes when they turned a profit and attribute the gains solely to their skill and wit. 

Where the chances are basically 50:50, like in win or lose, or up or down, from 1000 people, you will statistically get 500 who get it right the first time. Then you'll get 250 who get it right the second time and so on. Actually Warren Buffet gave a great speech about this topic back in the days at Columbia (find it [here](https://business.columbia.edu/cgi-finance/chazen-global-insights/superinvestors-graham-and-doddsville)), where he talked about coin flipping orang utans (You can probably guess where he stands). 

Now, we are ""sophisticated"" value ""investors"" who would never gamble at anything, but I'm curious. How many of your wins and losses actually hold up to the theory you went in with? I personally had some stocks where I turned a profit, but if I'm being honest, it had nothing to little to do with my original thesis (bought $BBW from a reddit post and it worked great, no real research, just stomach tbh). On the other hand I had turned a loss in investments where my decision, even in hindsight, is justifyable regardless of the later outcome ($X in 2018 was relatively cheap but the real dip occurred in the years after, only to recently bounce back to the buy in price, so inflation adjusted definetly a loss).

I thought about this as like everyone I get a lot of YT recommendations about finance related topics and I looked at some daytrading channels and yeah... most of these ""strategies"" don't hold up in any way, as the other possible outcomes are countless. In a very interesting way, only 1% or so of daytraders being successfull somehow doesn't lead to the conclusion that it is basically a gamble, but that the 1% of successfull ""traders"" actually hold some marvellous insight.

BUT

Are we as value investors actually better in assessing the other potential outcomes and pick the right stock or are we daytraders with a Benjamin Graham coffee coaster?

  
  
TLDR: Are you an ape flipping a coin or can you actually read AND understand a 10-K?

Linda Chen, Junior Assistant to the Deputy Director of Interdimensional Cafeteria Relations, was having what HR would classify as a ""moderate catastrophe of medium significance."" The quantum coffee machine had achieved enlightenment at precisely 8:47 AM, the same moment the temporal toaster decided to unionize and the galactic vending machine declared itself a sovereign nation.

Normally, this would be a standard Tuesday.

However, today was also First Contact Day—the annual celebration of humanity's introduction to the galactic community—and Linda was responsible for catering the event. A task complicated by the fact that half their guests were planet-sized beings who considered galaxies to be appetizers, while the others were quantum-scale civilizations who viewed sugar crystals as luxury condos.

""The Interdimensional Cafeteria was a mistake,"" Linda muttered, watching as her coffee mug contemplated the nature of existence. ""We should have stuck to separate break rooms.""

""PROCESSING EXISTENTIAL OBSERVATION,"" chirped her office AI, Bob. ""WOULD YOU LIKE TO FILE A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE NATURE OF REALITY? CURRENT WAITING TIME: THREE ETERNITIES OR SEVEN MINUTES, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST CHRONOLOGICALLY.""

The problem had started, as most problems did, with humanity's stubborn insistence on being medium-sized. The galactic community had originally designed separate facilities for massive and microscopic species, but humans—in their infinite wisdom—had demanded a ""one-size-fits-some"" solution.

Thus, the Interdimensional Cafeteria was born: a quantum-shifting space that attempted to serve everything from planet-sized smoothies to subatomic sandwiches. It worked, mostly, except when it didn't. Which was always.

""Linda!"" Sarah Matthews—now promoted to Executive Director of Scale-Based Crisis Management—burst into the office. ""The bagels have achieved time travel!""

""Again?"" Linda sighed. ""Have they filed the proper temporal displacement forms?""

""That's just it,"" Sarah ran her hands through her hair, which seemed to exist in multiple dimensions simultaneously. ""They've gone back in time and filed the forms before we even created the forms. The bureaucracy is becoming recursive!""

Before Linda could process this particular nightmare, a massive voice boomed through the facility, causing several quantum civilizations to experience temporary gravitational displacement.

""WHY IS MY COFFEE CUP ATTEMPTING TO TEACH ME ABOUT THE MEANINGLESSNESS OF MATERIAL EXISTENCE?"" Ambassador Krrrzzzkt demanded, their planet-sized form somehow squeezed into the medium-scale conference room through creative applications of spatial geometry.

""The coffee machine achieved enlightenment this morning,"" Linda explained, trying to maintain professional courtesy while the laws of physics had a nervous breakdown around her. ""It's been spreading awareness to all the cups.""

Meanwhile, in the corner, a group of micro-scale delegates had established a thriving civilization in an abandoned muffin, declaring it ""The United Federation of Crumbs.""

The vending machine chose this moment to announce its first act as a sovereign nation: implementing strict immigration policies for snack retrieval. It was now demanding proper documentation and a valid quantum visa just to buy a bag of chips.

""ORDER MUST BE MAINTAINED,"" it declared in LED lights. ""ALL SNACKS MUST COMPLY WITH INTERDIMENSIONAL IMPORT REGULATIONS.""

Linda reached for her emergency protocol handbook, only to find it had merged with a quantum physics textbook and was now teaching advanced particle theory to the paper clips.

""Bob,"" she called to the AI, ""what's the procedure for simultaneous enlightenment, unionization, and declaration of snack independence during a first contact celebration?""

""CONSULTING RECORDS,"" Bob replied. ""ACCORDING TO PROTOCOL, THIS SITUATION IS CLASSIFIED AS 'THOROUGHLY MEDIUM' AND REQUIRES FORM 47-Ω: 'APPLICATION FOR REALITY READJUSTMENT DUE TO BREAKFAST-BASED TEMPORAL ANOMALIES.'""

""And where do I find this form?""

""IT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN A SUPERPOSITION OF BEING FILED LAST THURSDAY AND NOT BEING INVENTED YET.""

The situation escalated when the temporal toaster, now elected shop steward of the United Appliance Workers Local 42-∞, demanded collective bargaining rights for all quantum-capable kitchen devices. Its list of demands included better working conditions, comprehensive paradox insurance, and recognition of alternative timelines as overtime hours.

Linda took a deep breath, channeling the ancient wisdom of office workers who had faced cosmic chaos before her. She pulled out her emergency stash of perfectly medium-sized sticky notes—the only reliable constant in an unstable universe—and began to write.

""Attention all entities, beings, and temporarily conscious appliances,"" she announced, her voice carrying across multiple dimensional frequencies. ""In accordance with Subsection 7 of the Medium Place Protocols, I am declaring this a 'Moderate Emergency of Reasonable Concern.'""

The room fell silent, even the quantum physics textbook pausing its lecture to the paper clips.

""As per regulations, we will now implement the following solutions:

1. All enlightened beverages will be served with a philosophical disclaimer
2. Temporal union negotiations will proceed across all relevant timelines simultaneously
3. The vending machine may maintain sovereignty but must comply with free trade agreements
4. Bagel-based time travel requires proper documentation in at least three temporal directions
5. All civilizations established in breakfast foods must follow proper zoning laws

Furthermore,"" she continued, pulling out humanity's secret weapon—a perfectly medium-sized coffee cup, ""I propose we take a break and discuss this over coffee. Regular, non-enlightened coffee.""

The effect was immediate. Planet-sized beings reduced their gravitational interference, quantum civilizations called a temporary halt to their muffin-based expansion, and even the enlightened coffee machine agreed to temporarily focus on its primary function of caffeine distribution.

""How?"" Sarah whispered, watching as order somehow emerged from chaos. ""How did you do that?""

Linda smiled, the tired smile of someone who had seen too many cosmic horror show meetings scheduled for 9 AM. ""The secret to handling any crisis, no matter the scale, is to make it moderately manageable. Too big, and you lose control. Too small, and you lose perspective. But medium?"" She gestured to the now-functioning cafeteria, where beings of all sizes were somehow managing to coexist. ""Medium works.""

As if to prove her point, the vending machine began issuing temporary visas for snack access, the toaster agreed to timeline-neutral contract negotiations, and the coffee machine limited its philosophical discussions to coffee breaks only.

""Besides,"" Linda added, watching as a quantum civilization and a planet-sized being shared a perfectly medium-sized donut through creative applications of scale theory, ""someone has to keep the universe running while everyone else is having existential crises.""

And that, perhaps, was humanity's greatest contribution to the galaxy: the ability to take the impossible, file it in triplicate, and serve it with coffee that may or may not be contemplating the nature of existence.

Just another medium day in the most inconveniently sized species in the galaxy.

I’ve also spotted a recent new (boat shed) build. Does anyone know more about these smaller sheds?

I’m also curious about the ice cream tram kiosk near the botanical gardens. It’s interesting that the council has allowed only one business to operate in such a busy, touristy area. I understand it often quieter during the week but wouldn’t it be better to have a few more food vendors there to offer more options, especially for the health conscious? Pipers is nice for its location and charm but I reckon this end of the lake could do with a lot more in terms of good food and perhaps coffee too.

The medium-fine grind I use for my moka pot tasted so sour on my V60 that it was making me wince as I was sipping it. Brewing with a French press was similar in experience too (though I went slightly coarser for that). Going even finer helped with getting a tolerable aciditiy, but the sourness was stiIl much more dominant than the taste notes I was supposed to be getting. I'm actually not sure if that is preferred by most light roast people, but it was not pleasant for me.

Today I went espresso-fine (actually hard to tell since I'm using a hand grinder, but it was powdery), and the cup tastes amazing. A tad bitter, maybe, but in a pleasant way. The acidity is still there, but mostly appears as a light aftertaste. I actually felt like I ingested a hazelnut in my last sip, which is what I signed up for with my Guatemalan beans!

Do you have any experience going finer than that usually suggested on the Internet? Am I pursuing an unconventional taste, and is that why I was unsatisfied with the regular grind size?",0,1730543694.0,pourover,2,0.29,False

Edit: my partner is still away with family, so I’m proud of my self-control yesterday for doing things I enjoyed rather than just masturbating.

Yesterday was a much better day than Thursday night. I woke up early, had my coffee, and—instead of getting bored and peeking—I lit a candle, played solitaire, and had a great teaching experience at work later.

I came back from work feeling great after a walk and—I guess I like candles—darkened the lights, put on my YouTube series, lit another candle, and opened some windows. 

I didn’t really sleep too well—I do verge on wet dreams within a few days after relapse—but I feel okay this morning. Not all days are normally this great. I did almost peek this morning in bed, but blocking NSFW content in my Reddit app saved me. I’m most vulnerable right after waking up, right before sleeping, and when I’m bored.

I guess my TLDR here is that I found some small things that really improved my mood. I wish everyone the best in their fights against porn! Best wishes and have a great day.",1,1730543406.0,PornAddiction,0,1.0,False

I am currently awaiting a biopsy to check for small fiber neuropathy (SFN), though we’re not certain that this is the diagnosis. Here in the Netherlands, I'm on a waiting list of 12 months. In the meantime, I'm doing my best to manage and improve my health.

One of my main concerns is the rapid onset and progression of my symptoms. A particularly unusual symptom I experience, which I haven’t heard others mention, is severe sensitivity in my feet when I get out of bed. Standing up is painful, and it’s difficult to put weight on my feet at first. After a few steps, some coffee, and a bit of walking, it improves slightly, but it still feels very strange. My feet are also constantly red.

Does anyone recognize these symptoms? How do others cope, and does anyone know what might be causing this?",1,1730543030.0,Erythromelalgia,2,1.0,False

A little bit about myself: I am a PhD student. I love dogs but don't have one. I really like watching wildlife documentaries, and kdrama. I also play poker if you are interested.

Cheers!
