I don't think I diluted it enough, at least my GF thought so lol. About an hour later my throat felt extremely dry and felt like a sore throat. I've been sneezing frequently so I thought maybe it was post nasal drip. I keep having to clear my throat and constantly swallow. It's a little better today but still irritating, feels like a sore/swollen throat. I don't feel sick at all, and before I drank the lemonade I had 3 clementines. I've never had this reaction to lemonade before, so I was wondering did I just not dilute it enough + the clementines I ate earlier? I drink 1-3 cups of coffee a day also. I took an allegra and that didn't do anything. Just curious cause I've never had this happen before, thank you!",1,1751652909.0,Allergies,0,1.0,False

Have noticed that feeling more than FULL makes me repeat this overeating or doesn't lemme eat normally for a few days & messes up exercise. Whereas if I'm travelling my body seamlessly switches to needing as little food as possible. Was thinking of doing 24hr fast after binges to let my body reset & maybe doing a weekly full day mild fast where I can drink black coffee, water, some nuts & dry blueberries & a nutritious dinner. Does anyone here do stuff like this? Ik people who do bi-weekly for religious purposes. I wanna try but just don't want more weekly inflammation.

1lrpisg,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1lrpisg/met_someone_in_a_similarly_toxic_relationship_to/,Met someone in a similarly toxic relationship to one I was in years ago and he’s so damn tormented and I feel a huge sense of “thank god this is not me anymore”,"In 2020 I got into a relationship with a girl. I’m a drug user/addict and those first months felt like a continuous high unparalleled by anything I tried besides maybe heroin and mdma, which this period felt remotely alike. 

First red flag was weeks in but it was actually the hook that got me because I had a cold, distant mother who would also throw abusive replies when she was stressed. So the girl went mia one day and it lasted thru the whole day. I was worried sick that something happened to her, didn’t think about anything. She came back online the next day saying she smoked lots of weed and slept all day.   Soon after she said we might need to split up because her family is opening a coffee shop in the capital and she’s needed to manage the place (she has no formal education for this nor experience past barrista).She months later drunkenly confessed that her ex was the one with the coffee shop and she thought about it and chose me. I now see this as half truth. 


After this more and more stuff happened, exploding out of nowhere, talking to ppl online and gaslighting me about it until somehow i found out and many other vile types of acts. In my 7 years of drug use at that point I never needed medical attention and after two years with her and her episodes, I wasn’t equipped to handle any of it and turned to what I knew. I had 2 gcs 3 comas and a psych ward visit on shrooms while in this relationship. 


Anyway this guy, 24 ish beautiful and loving dude but emotionally immature and very teenager like in behaviour and speech got hired as bartender where I work. We connected over drug use on cocaine obviously and because he was drunk high and traumatised and having no one to speak to about this he randomly dropped the phone in my face to read a convo. He bas basically trying to be supportive about a pain she had and she burst in insults and telling him he’s making her worse. I forgot to mention he’s always chatting to her on his phone via messages like 24/7 (smth i also did with my ex) and in between there are calls a few times a day when she’s threatening a break up.

Today we met again to ride the slopes and have a beer, he first postponed the time we planned and he randomly was ready to go earlier than the second planned time. We meet, buy the thing, get to mine and rack some up, no more than 25 mins pass and he calls her. Another fight. Basically she asked him to fck off before which she did and she waited for him to settle in to start another fight over why he did what she asked him to. Then he begged her to wait up bcs he s about to get a taxi. And he bounced.


I’m so glad and relieved this isn’t me anymore. Life of a drug addict is pretty bad obviously but WAY easier than putting up with ts.

//while writting this he called, she told him to fk off so he’s coming back

My partner and I are moving from Sydney to Seattle later this month and would love some help choosing where to live. We’re in our mid-thirties, enjoy quiet weeknights in, but love going out on weekends for good food, coffee, and outdoor adventures.

We’re both remote workers, but plan to go into the office about once a week/fortnight—mine is in Downtown Seattle and his is in Bellevue. We’re hoping to find a location that offers a reasonable commute to both, ideally somewhere that feels safe and well-connected.

We’ll be renting (ideally a 1- or 2-bedroom apartment, townhouse, or duplex) and have a friendly small dog, so dog-friendly housing and walkable green spaces are important to us. Our budget is up to \~$3,800/month, but we’re flexible for the right place.

We’re also looking forward to exploring the Pacific Northwest—hiking trails, mountains, small towns, lakes—so easy access to nature would be a huge bonus.

Would love any neighborhood recommendations that suit this lifestyle! Also open to tips from other expats or transplants on adjusting to Seattle life (especially with the weather shift!).

1lrpay8,https://i.redd.it/1t50ukcndwaf1.jpeg,How many of you are lost in The Upside Down/Hawkins? I need help 😂,"What I was working on instead of an art piece I was supposed to be working on 😐

**TLDR Be honest how many times have you guys and the more devoted fans watched this show? 
Do you guys find you have a similar issue getting lost inside Hawkins? I know I can’t be the only one but I also know I do have severe ADHD symptoms  which causes me to hyper focus.**

Update: I was the person who posted a while ago that she couldn’t get her bf to watch the show. 

I succeeded! Last week finally! 

I started him on Season 3 ( I know :(). We then stayed home and binged season 3 and 4 together in bed for two solid days. He absolutely got into it but had trouble admitting it to me. But at some point I said,  “Let’s take a break” just to test him and he wasn’t having it at all! He loves Erica, Hopper and Nancy  😂 those are his ride or dies I guess. 

So my birthday just passed 2 days ago.
When he asked me what I wanted to do I basically said I wanted to stay home and watch Stranger Things for my birthday. I also happened to be working on my essay for a group on here about Stranger Things. He also wasn’t having that. He thought it was insane I was writing an essay on Stranger Things on my birthday.  He basically forced me to go out to dinner, socialize and drink. I am grateful we had a good night. 

But we had a long afternoon discussing how I don’t leave the house (except to walk in the park) and only watch Stranger Things all day long.  

I realized maybe I do have a problem guys. :(

It is now 3 days later I woke up at 10am made myself some coffee and started S1 all over again. I even went through a small existential crisis for a few days where I forgot I had hobbies and other interests. It was like my entire brain was just filled up with Hawkins 24/7. I play chess, I am an artist and I like to write etc..

I have ADHD and I am neuro divergent so I really genuinely do have hyper focus issues. 

Literally no other shows or movies even interest me anymore. Which I know sounds insane. I just want to commit the entire show to memory which should take me about 4 full rewatches. 

I was this way with the  Harry Potter books  from age 11 until about age 23. So I’ve been through these extremely hyper focus issues before. But literally now Harry Potter and LOTR don’t even seem interesting to me anymore. It’s like they pale in comparison to this story structure and the attention to detail this series has. ( I know this isn’t really true. I’m just not being reasonable) 

I’ve even thought about watching Star Wars, E.T or The Explorers and Never Ending Story. Stuff that has a similar feel to Stranger Things that I grew up loving as a kid. But I never get around to it my brain just basically says “Stranger Things combines all these elements why do I need to watch anything else…” 

Be honest how many times have you guys and the more devoted fans watched this show? 

Do you guys find you have a similar issue getting lost inside Hawkins? I know I can’t be the only one but I also know I do have severe ADHD symptoms  which causes me to hyper focus on things for sometimes 10+ years at a time. It’s like my brain obsesses on a loop until I solve every last puzzle of the mythos. I know the only way to solve things is to immerse myself inside the story. 

I have already solved large parts of the ending of Season 5 because solving puzzles like this is how my brain is already wired . 

I’ve already had the emotional reaction to the end of Season 5 like the Netflix executives reported having when they learned the ending of Season 5 so I know I’m right.

2- When you get the big energy rewards from completing cards, prioritize the orders that give you crystal balls! 

3- When you get rewards from completing cards, you can trade 100 for a 4-star crystal ball, but it does NOT guarantee new cards. So at the worst, you could be trading 100 gems for a few duplicate card points, which isn’t worth it. 

4- Do the ‘free-if-you-watch-an-ad’ things in the shop every day (crystal balls, energy, and crate) to get new or duplicate cards, more energy for orders, and to be able to merge crates for the max reward

I get paid on Monday, so I’m trapped here all weekend at my house just waiting on my paycheck to hit. You guys know how it goes. 😭😭

I had unexpected things happen this pay period that was unavoidable that I had to pay so I’m just glad I was able to cover that, even if it means having $5 to last me a few days haha.

So basically I’m just going to be sitting here in my house all weekend because I can’t really afford to leave my house, luckily I have groceries to last me a few days and my cats have food, I don’t really NEED anything. Very thankful. I have a long weekend though because I work in finance so my job was closed today, so I have a few days of no alarms(😁!!), and I was thinking this would be such a perfect time to get into this video game!! Finally some time to myself!! And it’s unfortunately during a time where I have nothing from my check leftover so I have nothing to do! Haha. Of course right! 😂 I have the switch, and I’ve always wanted to get into Stardew Valley. I mean I watch videos and let’s plays of this game all the time, but I’ve never experienced it for myself!!!

I just want to build my little farm, and run around meeting all of the different characters! You can even get married and have kids in this game! People get so addicted to it and I just want to get absorbed into the world and forget about all of my problems and burdens for a little bit. Just pour a cup of my ice coffee and stay up way too late ❤️

My life has become just me working. That is all I do. I guess that’s just how life is going to be nowadays from here on out. I guess that’s what’s normal, right? I don’t know. It’s really depressing and the only relief I get is from playing a good game, and this is one I’ve really been wanting to try for a while now. I just want to feel happy if only for a little bit overnight in a little fictional world. :’ ) I don’t think people really understand how beneficial games can really be. 

I know it’s silly but that’s legit the real reason!! I can send you pictures of my switch and me buying it and playing it even! 😭 I can show you pictures of my animals and crops and who I choose to marry! 

I get paid on Monday though and I can send it back plus $5. I tried posting on subs where you didn’t have to pay back but I guess people just think it’s silly and downvoted me without commenting or anything like that. 😢 I know it’s probably silly to some people but this is just one thing that would dramatically uplift my entire weekend.

Before i was having to go through bags of available coffee and reticent to try roasters and their offerings after what always felt like a crap shoot. Rotation is awesome and its easy to see the response from roasters. Cant wait for the founders subscription to arrive. 

My first go around with dak pineberry was as a pourover and i really enjoyed it. I’ve previously shied away from using my rotations as espresso for various reasons. Time, dial-in, gram usage. etc. however decided to brew and espresso and see how it goes. Spoiler it was friggin great. 20g in to 40ish out. Tried it straight and it was really special compared to my normal espressos. Definitely believe it would be somewhat nice as a cafe breve, lost as a capp and definitely a waste as latte.

I know, i know - my home coffee corner game is pretty un-epic, i really dont have adequate space in my kitchen area for all the cooking/brewing equipment and usage we use. Maybe one day i’ll figure out a more aesthetic solution. ",0,1751651438.0,coffeerotation,0,0.5,False

 The message  read 

Everything that required nurturing or tending—you neglected.
Your home, your child, your dog, your properties.
You didn’t invest in any of it the way you should have.
You just patched things up temporarily to avoid discomfort, hoping it would all somehow function without real effort.
You made it look good on the outside without ever doing the real work within.
And I was supposed to do the same—tolerate the bare minimum and feel grateful for the scraps.
You never planned to grow anything. You just wanted to preserve your comfort.
And anything that asked more of you—emotionally, physically, consistently—you treated like a burden instead of a responsibility.
You keep saying I’m trying to make you feel bad. I’m not.
I’m bringing this up because for so long, I fought for you.
I stayed quiet to protect your peace.
I overlooked so much—not because I was naive, but because I loved you that deeply.
I kept choosing you over and over again, even when it was hurting me.
But I’m tired now.
Because no matter what I do, it will never be enough.
You will always punish me for someone else’s mistakes.
I became your emotional punching bag—not just for you, but for your son too.
And I’ve said this before.
You already told me I have no future in your life. That I have no value to be part of it.
How do you expect someone to keep showing up with love after hearing that?
I’ll never win with you.
You’ll never let me win.
I can do everything right—ask for permission before I speak, before I move, before I love—and you’ll still find a fault.
And what hurts most is how much you twist.
You’ll ask for something, say you love it, and then when I give it—you deny ever wanting it.
I could make your favorite food, and suddenly you’ll claim you never liked it, and that I just made it up.
But I remember. You said it. And I believed you.
Because I pay attention.
Because I listen.
Because I care.
And maybe the most painful part?
I started to question whether your “I love yous” ever really meant anything—or if they were just a temporary script, designed to pull closeness without actually committing to it.
Because you always knew: if you said it, you’d get it back. Every time.
But if I said it?
It felt like I was risking everything.
It started to feel like I had to say it at the exact right time, in the exact right way—or I’d be left standing there, alone.
You made it unsafe to love you freely.
Unsafe to show up without performing it just right.
That’s not connection. That’s control.
And I deserve more than that.
I deserve love that isn’t weaponized or rationed. I deserve to say “I love you” without fear of being punished for it later.
I’m not crying because I’m broken.
I’m crying because I see it all now—the time, the care, the intention I poured into you—and how easily you tried to rewrite history like I was never there.
I taught you how to cook.
I gave your dog a second favorite human.
There’s a garden in your backyard because I planted it—not just in the soil, but in your life.
And like so many things I gave you, you neglected it.
It could have bloomed. It could have fed you.
But you left it to dry up until it was easier to pretend it was never planted.
Your spice rack expanded the same way your relationship with your son did—because I noticed the gaps and cared enough to fill them.
Because I see potential and meet it with action.
I showed up for your home, your growth, your routines—not to fix you, but because that’s who I am. That’s not weakness or something not worth respect.
I improve lives. I bring warmth. I pay attention.
So it hurts—not because I wanted praise or recognition—but because you tried to erase the fact that I made a difference.
And worse—you reduced everything I did to nothing, as if it held no meaning at all.
Like my love, my effort, my presence were disposable. Forgettable. Replaceable.You may twist the narrative however you need to to feel better.
But you and I both know—it started with me.
And while you’ve been okay giving the bare minimum and receiving the same, I’m not.
I never have been.
I don’t survive off emotional scraps.
I don’t stay in places where I have to convince someone to show up for themselves.
I cry because I gave deeply.
And you made it look like it didn’t matter.
But I know it did.
And deep down—so do you.



After going lying by line and writing description of what I said, I wrote:

Everything that required nurturing or tending—you neglected.
Your home, your child, your dog, your properties.
That wasn’t said to insult you. It was said to show a pattern. I watched you patch things
temporarily rather than nurture them long-term “that will do” : your home “that will do”
, your
relationships like sandy sandy needed training every day and you would say she's too young to
know anything. It takes 10 minutes to train her. Little foot you told me yourself you saw him
crying after a match and instead of walking up to him, you walked away. I never said you were a
horrible parent ever. Your properties you kept looking for a new buy a new purchase when you
already had a fixer upper, your health when your shoulder was messed up and you wouldn’t
rest.,instead on working on what's in front of you, you looked for other things to distract you That
wasn’t judgment(it was observation).
You didn’t invest in any of it the way you should have.
You just patched things up temporarily to avoid discomfort, hoping it would all somehow function
without real effort.
You made it look good on the outside without ever doing the real work within.
Yes, everything looks great on the outside of a photo of sandy but she bites, she poops on beds, she's
stressed out, she has anxiety, she is the making of your energy.
Little Foot is amazingly smart, but he's hurting. He's clearly hurting, he's drinking more if you haven’t
noticed and at that point he doesn't care what you think about it because he leaves the bottles around. I'm
not his mother but I'm so worried about him because I care about him so much. David, your son is hurting
and he's dealing with it the only way you taught him how to distract and avoid. And that is not all on you
because it was honestly passed down.
And I was supposed to do the same—tolerate the bare minimum and feel grateful for the scraps.
David said that one day I slept in your bed after you only slept upstairs. I felt like a dog when the owner
finally let them sleep in the bed with them. When you kept telling me I could come over but you didn't
want your son to see me. ( it felt l should be grateful you let me over in the first place)
You never planned to grow anything. You just wanted to preserve your comfort.
And anything that asked more of you—emotionally, physically, consistently—you treated like a
burden instead of a responsibility.
every time the relationship started to move forward—when real progress was finally happening—you’d
pull back.
You keep saying I’m trying to make you feel bad. I’m not.
I’m bringing this up because for so long, I fought for you.
I mean exactly that—I wasn’t trying to hurt you.You can't say I did not fight for you because I did
I stayed quiet to protect your peace.
I overlooked so much—not because I was naive, but because I loved you that deeply.
I kept choosing you over and over again, even when it was hurting me.
I kept my feelings to myself so I wouldn’t upset you. I put you before myself. And you know this as well. I
would drop everything I was doing even when i didn't have a car and take a bus and uber just to get to
you and i would do it also sometime because you hated driving to miami so i would save you the drive but
when you drop me off home i could get that little bit of extra time with you..
But I’m tired now.
And I am i gave so much of myself and i not tired because of that i'm tired because i really tired
Because no matter what I do, it will never be enough.
You will always punish me for someone else’s mistakes.
Trying to prove myself, to earn your trust and love—but it felt like I was being judged for things I didn’t do.
I wasn’t the person who hurt you in the past, but I kept feeling like I had to pay for their damage. No
matter how hard I tried, it felt like you were always waiting for me to mess up, instead of seeing that I was
really trying. You got mad at me because I said I would miss you in Canada. You told me why am I trying
to keep you here. Your wife kept you from your family for years and I was trying to make you feel bad for
seeing them. It was a form of endearment but you put it as entrapment.
I became your emotional punching bag—not just for you, but for your son too.
And I’ve said this before.
I often ended up being the one who got the frustration, anger, or blame—whether I caused the problem or
not.
You’d take things out on me when you were overwhelmed, and your son started doing the same. He’s
angry and hurt with his mother. It's clear as day and he did take it out on me. His mother was not
affectionate. But I tried to give him space. I respected his room. I didn't talk to him much which was odd to
me because if he got to know me we had a lot in common. If he was angry, don't talk to him. It felt like my
job was to absorb everyone’s emotions.
You already told me I have no future in your life.
I was repeating something you told me directly
That I have no value to be part of it.
How do you expect someone to keep showing up with love after hearing that?
I’ll never win with you.
You’ll never let me win.
I can do everything right—ask for permission before I speak, before I move, before I love—and you’ll still
find a fault.
And what hurts most is how much you twist.
You’ll ask for something, say you love it, and then when I give it—you deny ever wanting it.
I could make your favorite food, and suddenly you’ll claim you never liked it, and that I just made it up.
But I remember. You said it. And I believed you.
Because I pay attention.
Because I listen.
Because I care.
And maybe the most painful part?
I started to question whether your “I love yous” ever really meant anything—or if they were just a
temporary script, designed to pull closeness without actually committing to it.
Because you always knew: if you said it, you’d get it back. Every time.
But if I said it?
It felt like I was risking everything.
It started to feel like I had to say it at the exact right time, in the exact right way—or I’d be left
standing there, alone.
I remember after Mother’s Day, I sent you a text saying “I love you,
” and you didn’t say it back. Right after,
you told me you were breaking up with me and moving to Canada for good—because Littlefoot was going
away to college. Then you actually left for Canada. And while you were there, you called me and said,
“When I say this, I mean it, Allie—I love you.
”every time you said it, you knew you’d get it back—no matter
what. Whether it was a good day, a bad day, or after an argument, I was always ready to say it back. But
when I said it first, it felt risky—like I might say the wrong thing at the wrong time and lose you.I became
scared to say ""I love you"" at all—because I didn’t know if you’d say it back. And if you didn’t, I was
terrified it meant you were done with me. That kind of fear doesn’t come from love—it comes from
instability.And I believed you. Every time you said “I love you,
” I believed it was real. I trusted it. But in the
end, you were always the one in the position to say it or withhold it. To stay or walk away. To remove me
from your life completely—because the love was always on your terms, and I was always left wondering if
it was safe to love you back.
You made it unsafe to love you freely.
Unsafe to show up without performing it just right.
That’s not connection. That’s control.
I used to make your coffee every morning, wash the dishes, fold laundry, clean, prep meals… not
because I was trying to take over, but because that’s in my nature—especially when I care deeply for
someone. That’s how I show love.You’d come home tired and say you didn’t know what to do, and I
stepped in to make life easier. Not to take your independence, but to support you. To be your peace. But
instead of seeing it as love, you told me I was taking something away from you.And that made me feel
like even my care was a threat—it felt like nothing I did was ever the right way to love you.
And I deserve more than that.
I deserve love that isn’t weaponized or rationed. I deserve to say “I love you” without fear of being
punished for it later.
I meant I deserve love that’s consistent and safe—not something that’s used to control me or taken away
when I do something you don’t like.Saying “I love you” shouldn’t feel like a risk. But with you, sometimes it
did. I never knew if I’d get love back or if I’d be met with silence, attitude, or distance. That kind of love
made me anxious, not secure.
I’m not crying because I’m broken.
I’m crying because I see it all now—the time, the care, the intention I poured into you—and how
easily you tried to rewrite history like I was never there.
I taught you how to cook.
I gave your dog a second favorite human.
I’m not crying because I’m broken. I’m crying because I’m just now feeling the weight of everything I
gave—and how little it seemed to matter to you every time you were quick to say you were done or hop
on Hinge like I was nothing.I cried because I put so much time, care, and intention into loving you. I
showed up fully—heart, hands, and all. I didn’t hold back. I chose you again and again, even when it cost
me parts of myself.And it wasn’t just about you—I cared about what came with you. I took time to help
train Sandy because I was worried. She’s a handful, and I didn’t want her being your regret and you did
get frustrated. I was trying to create ease, structure, support—not just in your home, but in your life.To feel
like all of that could be tossed aside the second things got inconvenient That’s what hurt me most.
There’s a garden in your backyard because I planted it—not just in the soil, but in your life.
And like so many things I gave you, you neglected it.
It could have bloomed. It could have fed you.
But you left it to dry up until it was easier to pretend it was never planted.
I meant I didn’t just physically plant something—I was investing in your life, in creating something that
could grow if it was cared for.That garden was a symbol of everything I brought—nurturing, effort, love.
And just like the relationship,right after we broke up the first time, you didn’t tend to it. You let it wither.
Not because it didn’t have potential, but because it was easier to ignore it than to do the work.It could’ve
been beautiful, it was hard but It could’ve supported and fed you in more ways than one. But instead, it
was forgotten—like so many other things I gave with my whole heart.
Your spice rack expanded the same way your relationship with your son did—because I noticed
the gaps and cared enough to fill them.
Because I see potential and meet it with action.
I meant I paid attention to the little things and the big ones.I saw what was missing—not just in your
kitchen, but in your connection with your son—and I did what I could to help fill those spaces with care,
consistency, and love. That’s just who I am. I don’t just see potential—I act on it. I try to make things
better. And I did that in your life, too.
I showed up for your home, your growth, your routines—not to fix you, but because that’s who I
am. That’s not weakness or something not worth respect.
I improve lives. I bring warmth. I pay attention.
I meant I didn’t do those things because I thought you were broken—I did them because I cared. That’s
how I love.I saw where you were struggling, where things felt heavy or sad, and I tried to bring light and
support—not control. That’s not weakness. That’s emotional strength. That’s love in action.I bring warmth.
I notice the details.
So it hurts—not because I wanted praise or recognition—but because you tried to erase the fact
that I made a difference.
And worse—you reduced everything I did to nothing, as if it held no meaning at all.
Like my love, my effort, my presence were disposable. Forgettable. Replaceable.You may twist the
narrative however you need to to feel better.
I meant I didn’t do any of this to be thanked or celebrated. I did it from the heart. But watching
you act like none of it mattered—that’s what hurt.
It’s painful to have everything I poured into you and your life reduced to nothing. Like my love,
my effort, and my presence didn’t mean anything at all. Like I could just be replaced or
forgotten.That kind of erasure cuts deep—especially when I know I gave my all.And yes,( this
letter was written a few days ago that why it was so long i cried when i wrote it. It came from real
emotion and reflection. It wasn’t about being dramatic.)
But you and I both know—it started with me.
And while you’ve been okay giving the bare minimum and receiving the same, I’m not.
I never have been.
I don’t survive off emotional scraps.
I don’t stay in places where I have to convince someone to show up for themselves.
I cry because I gave deeply.
And you made it look like it didn’t matter.
But I know it did.
And deep down—so do you.
I wrote that part even though I was scared—because I needed to say it for myself. Because I did matter.
I took whatever you were willing to give me, and I held onto it like it was precious. Even when it was
small, inconsistent, or temporary—I cherished it. Because it came from you.I fought a robber over a
necklace that you probably don’t even think twice about. But to me, it wasn’t just jewelry. It was a memory.
It was the first gift you ever gave me. Your words were “It's not much but I wanted to get you a gift”
. It
reminded me of the version of you who gave it to me. That moment made me feel seen, loved—even if
only for a second.Maybe that sounds stupid to you. But to me? Even the smallest things carry meaning
when love is rare. When effort is rare. That necklace represented something I was trying to hold onto. Not
because I needed things—but because I needed you to mean it.So no—I didn’t write that letter to be
cruel. I wrote it to finally honor what I gave, what I felt, and what I held onto long after you let it go.
You asked me why, after everything I wrote, I’d even want you in my life.It’s because—even
through all the pain, the confusion, and the hurt—not once did I say I stopped loving you.
Not once did I discard you.
What I did do… was close the door on ever expecting you to love me back.I’m taking time out to
go through everything I wrote, line by line, to show you it came from truth—not bitterness. That’s
not something you do for someone you hate. That’s something you do for someone you loved
deeply.I don’t know if Teddy will ever come back.
I don’t know if I’ll ever hear you call me Bunny again.
But I do know I can’t keep hoping for it.Because the more I hope, the more you push me away.
And I’m finally learning that holding on to love doesn’t mean I have to keep hurting for it.

On a remarqué qu’on était quelques-uns à galérer à élargir notre cercle d’amis - que ce soit parce qu’on vient d’arriver à Québec, qu’on est dans une nouvelle phase de vie, ou qu’on en a juste marre de scroller Facebook et Insta pour trouver une activité qui fait du sens.

Trop d’infos, pas assez d’affinités, pas facile de savoir avec qui on va tomber.

Alors on a décidé de créer une app, pensée pour faciliter les rencontres amicales **autour d’activités qui nous ressemblent** (rando, café, jeux, sorties, pad thai, etc.).

Alors OUI, on sait. Certains sont totalement anti App et on comprend tout à fait que ce mode de fonctionnement ne soit pas pour tout le monde. En revanche il y a du monde pour qui c’est plutôt pratique de passer d’abord par une application pour s’engager socialement.

Pas de dating, pas d’ambiguïté. Juste une façon simple de rencontrer du monde, seul·e, en couple ou entre amis.

L’idée vous parle ? On a mis en ligne une liste d’attente qui vous permettra d’obtenir 6 mois de fonctionnalités premium gratuites et puis surtout d’être nos bêta testeurs préférés ❤️

Il y la possibilité de répondre à un questionnaire pour mieux connaitre vos attentes aussi 😊

👉 [Waitlist](http://waitlist.friendzapp.ovh/)

Merci pour votre temps  Et n’hésitez pas à partager si vous pensez à quelqu’un que ça pourrait aider.

 \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We noticed we’re not the only ones struggling to expand our circle of friends - whether it’s because we just moved to Québec, we’re going through a new phase in life, or we’re simply tired of endlessly scrolling Facebook and Instagram trying to find something that actually makes sense.  
Too much noise, not enough real connection. And it’s hard to know who you’ll end up with.

So we decided to create an app designed to make it easier to build friendships **through activities that feel like** ***us*** (hikes, coffee meetups, game nights, outings, pad thai, etc.).

And YES, we get it - some people are totally anti-app, and we totally respect that. But for many, starting with an app is actually a simple and convenient way to connect socially.

No dating, no ambiguity. Just an easy way to meet people - whether you’re solo, in a couple, or with friends.

Sounds like something you’d be into? We’ve launched a waitlist where you can get 6 months of free premium features and be one of our favorite beta testers ❤️  
You can also answer a quick questionnaire to help us better understand what you’re looking for 😊

He makes 4-5 cappucinos per day, and I empty and rinse the liquid waste and grounds every day, but it smells terrible. He uses Jura's descaling and cleaning tablets on the recommended schedule to clean the milk system itself, but the waste tray smells horrific because the system is constantly in use and it always rinses itself out in between each coffee, so it never seems to dry out. 

I scrub the waste tray out for him with Dawn a couple times a week, and I always pour the waste out in the evenings since he tends to forget and leave it overnight. But in another day or two, the smell comes right back. It grosses me out so much -- I can smell it just walking by.

Is there anything I can do differently to keep nastiness from building up in the waste tray? Bleach tablets or anything? I'd be so grateful for any tips!",1,1751651041.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

The last laptop I owned was a MacBook Pro. While I liked it overall, I didn’t love it. I mainly used it while studying graphic design, as it was suggested for the program. I know Macs are great laptops, but I prefer Windows.

My ideal budget is around $1200–$1500 CAD or less.

**Primary uses:**

* Browsing and multitasking
* Graphic design (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.)
* Light gaming
* Streaming movies

**Important to me:**

* Screen size: 15–16""ish
* Battery life (the longer the better)
* Well-built overall
* Great speed/performance
* Strong Wi-Fi capability
* Decent storage (I do have a 4TB external drive but I rarely ever use it, and it's only for backups)
* Good graphics and sound quality
* Backlit full keyboard (with number pad) — the less bulky/heavy, the better
* At least 2 USB ports and 1 HDMI port
* Doesn’t run hot constantly
* Fairly quiet operation

**Nice to have:**

* Built-in camera
* CD drive (I have an external one but rarely use it)

I’m looking for a laptop that is ready to go out of the box, will last me a while, and won’t need internal upgrades (at least for the short-term).

I already have a custom-built gaming PC at home that’s lasted me about three years and still runs like new. This laptop will mainly be used when I’m out and about (like at a coffee shop or something)—to get things done or unwind during downtime. I wouldn’t be using it every day, so I may not even need to spend the full budget.

I've seen a lot of people recommend this one:

That said, I’ve owned an HP laptop and PC in the past, and both ended up being a disappointment. So I’m a bit hesitant to go with them. Other than HP Victus, Asus TUF and Acer Nitro laptops keep coming up as well.

Any recommendations are appreciated — thanks!",1,1751651032.0,GamingLaptops,0,1.0,False

Trop d’infos, pas assez d’affinités, pas facile de savoir avec qui on va tomber.

Alors on a décidé de créer une app, pensée pour faciliter les rencontres amicales **autour d’activités qui nous ressemblent** (rando, café, jeux, sorties, pad thai, etc.).

Alors OUI, on sait. Certains sont totalement anti App et on comprend tout à fait que ce mode de fonctionnement ne soit pas pour tout le monde. En revanche il y a du monde pour qui c’est plutôt pratique de passer d’abord par une application pour s’engager socialement.

Pas de dating, pas d’ambiguïté. Juste une façon simple de rencontrer du monde, seul·e, en couple ou entre amis.

L’idée vous parle ? On a mis en ligne une liste d’attente qui vous permettra d’obtenir 6 mois de fonctionnalités premium gratuites et puis surtout d’être nos bêta testeurs préférés ❤️

Il y la possibilité de répondre à un questionnaire pour mieux connaitre vos attentes aussi 😊

👉 [Waitlist](http://waitlist.friendzapp.ovh/)

Merci pour votre temps  Et n’hésitez pas à partager si vous pensez à quelqu’un que ça pourrait aider.

 \------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We noticed we’re not the only ones struggling to expand our circle of friends - whether it’s because we just moved to Québec, we’re going through a new phase in life, or we’re simply tired of endlessly scrolling Facebook and Instagram trying to find something that actually makes sense.  
Too much noise, not enough real connection. And it’s hard to know who you’ll end up with.

So we decided to create an app designed to make it easier to build friendships **through activities that feel like** ***us*** (hikes, coffee meetups, game nights, outings, pad thai, etc.).

And YES, we get it - some people are totally anti-app, and we totally respect that. But for many, starting with an app is actually a simple and convenient way to connect socially.

No dating, no ambiguity. Just an easy way to meet people - whether you’re solo, in a couple, or with friends.

Sounds like something you’d be into? We’ve launched a waitlist where you can get 6 months of free premium features and be one of our favorite beta testers ❤️  
You can also answer a quick questionnaire to help us better understand what you’re looking for 😊

It was getting considerably better everyday until my step-dad got back from a work trip. He is the type to make a meal before leaving and expect it get cleaned up while he's gone. Well  he gets back late makes himself a meal and bam ants are back like we never did anything.

 Now here is where I may be overreacting. This morning  I wake up to find the kitchen I cleaned yet again had been used and more ants this time they are now in my coffee. Pissed off I say im done cleaning and trying to stop these ants since im the only one that cares. Fast forward a few hours step-dad makes the oatmeal cookies he likes whatever at least he actually cleaned up. What he didn't do was put the cookies away because ""they were cooling"" and ants found their way and absolutely  INFESTED  them. 

Am i overreacting for blowing up and not dealing with the ant problem anymore? At this point im keeping all of my food far away from the kitchen and letting them deal with it.",2,1751650868.0,AmIOverreacting,0,1.0,False

I stuck with it for a while because I paid for two years up front, but now that it’s up for renewal, I’m kind of glad I get to try something else.

The main things I use a VPN for are streaming, avoiding region-based restrictions, and a bit of general privacy when I’m on public Wi-Fi (I travel for work, so airports and coffee shops are my second home). I don’t need it for anything crazy like torrenting or running a business off my phone, but I still want something reliable, fast, and not sketchy.

So before I go down another two-year rabbit hole with a random provider, I wanted to ask, what’s the best mobile VPN right now in 2025, according to people actually using it?

1lronv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce_Men/comments/1lronv1/boundaries_vs_higher_standards_postdivorce/,Boundaries vs Higher Standards Post-Divorce,"The longer I've been divorced (going on 4 years), the more I'm exposed to the potential modern dating market, and the more I come across rage posts and videos, the more I realize an interesting trend along gender lines.

After divorce, us men have stronger boundaries.

After divorce, most women add more unreasonable ""qualifications"" to their prospective partner list.

Just let that sink in. For all the huff-and-puff about ""not needing no man"", I more often see content where the men are walking away entirely, and women spout more entitlement to a ""unicorn man"".

Sure, not all men or women; much as the internet thinks in black and white, we're all unique snowflakes, and we're all humans who deserve love so long as we're decent people willing to put in the effort. We all build stronger boundaries in some form.

Just interesting to notice that, while women often weaponize/deny access to sex as a control mechanism, it's us men who deny access to relationships and resources in the first place.

It's us men who, while they like to make fun of us for being ""lonely"", seem to be better suited to it once we get past the loss, and realize how rewarding and peaceful it is to just invest in our children, our hobbies, and our life goals in general.

Especially for those of us who have ""been there, done that"" through however many marriages and divorces. Eventually, it seems we simply accept the ""L"" every time and just stop caring about the chase/companionship when the pattern just repeats itself.

My divorce has taught me a few major lessons: Never legally remarry, never co-own property, and never fully co-habitate again if/when I start dating. Never let her become the center of my world again.

That doesn't mean if I eventually date again that I won't respect her or neglect her needs... just that I will never go in blind again. I'll never ignore the red flags again. I'll never make my world and resources revolve around her again. 

That, if women can ""demand"" some unicorn Chad, then I have a right to demand protecting my resources (which is actually realistic). That, if she gets mad that I refuse to legally marry or co-own property or co-habitate fully, it's just a better filter for red flags. 

I've already filtered a couple ladies this way - one blew up on me in public and called me ""selfish"", then stormed out when I said I'd never co-own property again. That's after she had the audacity, on our first brunch meet-up (after only a coffee date previously, without even the benefit of a sex sample or anything beyond a hug in between), to even ask me about such things. Bullet fucking dodged.

I know it's hard not to want to play our whole hand whenever we find a new prospective partner. It's our cultural and genetic programming as men to be providers and secure a mate by showing our resources. 

However, in today's world, I simply conclude that we must be wiser about it. And that's one of the reasons I'm grateful groups like this exist. That our fellow men are finally coming together to support each other more, instead of mindlessly compete for a new lady.",5,1751650742.0,Divorce_Men,0,1.0,False
1lronil,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1lronil/bupropion_overstimulation/,Bupropion overstimulation,"Hi all. Here's a timeline of my journey:

* Bupropion XL 150mg for a month - no changes.
* Increased to 300mg - totally fine for 3 weeks.
* Added Buspirone 40mg - didn't think nothing of it at the time.
* A few days pass and I start feeling zaps, not like from withdrawal. If I drink coffee they get worse.
* A few more days pass my mood is in the dumpster.
* A few more days pass my erection is nonexistent.
* I assumed it was Buspirone fault and stopped using it.
* 2 more weeks pass and the symptoms are still there and getting worse, crying everyday, can't work.
* At this point I begin to question if one week of Buspirone was really the culprit.
* I begin to notice that my junk has become very sensitive (good) but erections are still very bad.
* It's been a month now since I increased to 300mg and I'm about to end up in a psych ward.

Summing it all together, do you think it's Bupropion 300mg is overstimulating my CNS? Considering the zaps, sensitive junk but no erections. Have you ever experienced this? Would going down to 150mg solve these issues?

It's 2023, and hustle culture is officially out. But why are some companies still treating sleep like an optional bonus? 🤔

**Here's the kicker:** Smart teams are flipping the script and turning snooze into a strategy. Prioritizing rest and wellness is not just about being kind to employees. It's a powerhouse move that amps up productivity, slashes burnout, and keeps those costly safety hazards at bay. 💤

Let’s get real for a sec. We've all been there—each yawning stretch of a coffee-fueled all-nighter adding up, dragging us down. It's no shocker that sleep deprivation is burning a hole in company pockets, racking up billions in lost productivity.

Forward-thinking companies are catching on. They're ditching the graveyard shifts and adding sleep-positive policies into their playbooks. Led by champions like Dr. Matthew Walker and Arianna Huffington, innovative businesses are shifting focus from crash-and-burn sprints to sustainable, steady success.

**Don't settle for burnout; it's not a badge of honor.** Let's demand a smarter workspace that values our well-being. Prioritize sleep today and watch the real productivity—and sanity—flourish. 🌟

Areas that include Okinawa (Japan), Sardinia (Italy), Ikaria (Greece), Loma Linda (California), and Nicoya (Costa Rica)  
  
A key focus? Polyphenols: anti-inflammatory plant compounds found in common foods.

They’re not claiming miracles, but the science is seems pretty solid: polyphenols may impact chronic inflammation, mitochondrial stress, and cellular aging — all of which show up in IBD too.

Breakdown of what these centenarians actually eat. Of course where someone is on their gut health journey can, maybe temporarily, influence what food can be eaten today vs. later. 

\- **Okinawa, Japan**

* Purple sweet potatoes (anthocyanins)
* Tofu, miso, natto (soy isoflavones)
* Bitter melon
* Turmeric (curcumin)
* Seaweed
* Green tea (catechins)

\- **Sardinia, Italy**

* Cannonau red wine (procyanidins)
* Coffee (chlorogenic acid)
* Olive oil (oleuropein)

\- **Ikaria, Greece**

* Extra virgin olive oil
* Wild greens, onions, arugula (various flavonoids)
* Herbal mountain tea (Sideritis)
* Greek-style boiled coffee

\- **Loma Linda, California (Seventh-day Adventists)**

* Nuts and seeds
* Beans and soy products
* Tons of fruits (mangoes, papaya, berries)
* Little or no processed food or animal products

\- **Nicoya, Costa Rica**

* Black beans (rich in flavonoids)
* Mango and papaya
* Squash
* Simple, traditional meals

 Across studies, these polyphenol-rich diets are linked to lower inflammatory markers, better metabolic profiles, and reduced oxidative stress. In animal studies and some human trials, specific polyphenols (like quercetin, genistein, curcumin, and EGCG) have shown effects on pathways tied to IBD—like NF-κB, IL-1β, and TNF-α suppression.

Not claiming this is a cure for IBD. But if someone is dealing with inflammation daily, it’s worth asking: **What if our diet could nudge our system toward repair instead of constant defense?**

No woo, just nerding out on food-based anti-inflammatory strategies that happen to be shared by cultures where, interestingly enough, people don't get wiped out by chronic disease.

Happy to share the paper if anyone’s curious.

Should i bother to contact them?

There were times I didn’t write a single line of code for days — not because I was too busy, but because I was **burned out or demotivated**. Sometimes I’d open Unity, stare at the screen, and just close it.

But I reminded myself: I **really love making games**. Even if it’s slow, even if it's messy, even if no one notices — it’s still mine. That thought kept me going.

So I kept chipping away — one puzzle, one bug, one dialog box at a time. Finally, I finished and published my first Android game. It’s an **escape room-style puzzle game** where you find clues, connect them logically, and unlock the gate.

The game isn't perfect. But it’s real. And it’s out. And that feeling... man, it’s worth every hour.

If you’re stuck, tired, or doubting yourself: I feel you. But don’t quit. Keep building — even if it's just one line of code at a time. You never know what you'll create. 🚀

1lrnz5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfreliance/comments/1lrnz5p/article_staying_cool_in_summer_top_tips_to_keep/,[Article] Staying cool in summer: Top tips to keep cool in hot weather (by RedCross),"While basking in the sunshine is a wonderful thing, extreme heat can be deadly, affecting younger and older people, pregnant women, and those with chronic health conditions.

But there's a lot we can do to protect ourselves and our loved ones from the heat.

 

**1. Be sun smart**

It's best to avoid going out during the hottest hours of the day, but sometimes that can't be avoided. When out in direct sunlight remember:

* Wear (and regularly reapply) sunscreen.
* Cover your head with a hat.
* Take regular breaks indoors or in a shady area to avoid getting heat exhaustion or heatstroke.
* Wearing light-coloured, loose-fitting clothing will also help you to stay cool.

 

**2. Wetter is better**

Heat escapes through the skin, which is the largest organ in the body. So, the more skin you can cool down, the better. 

There are various methods for how to cool your skin down in baking hot weather:

* Drenching a t-shirt and keeping it wet can be very effective.
* Buy cooling spray.
* Having a cool shower - not freezing as you should cool down slowly.

 You can **quickly cool yourself down** by putting your hands and feet in cold water. Wrists and ankles have lots of pulse points where blood vessels are close to the skin, so you will cool down more quickly.





**3. Drink plenty of water**

In hot weather, it's important to avoid caffeine and make sure you're drinking lots of water. If possible, drink isotonic sports drinks to replenish the lost salts, sugars, and fluids.

Both cool and hot drinks will work to keep your core temperature at the same temperature. Consuming hot drinks will not cool you down more effectively than cold drinks. In the heat, you should avoid drinks containing caffeine, including tea and coffee, it's typically best to stick to water. As you sweat throughout the day, the liquids you are losing need to be replaced to avoid dehydration.

Symptoms of dehydration include:

* a dry mouth
* dizziness or confusion
* headaches

If untreated, dehydration can lead to heat exhaustion. If the person’s condition gets worse, you should call **999** for emergency help.

Find out more with our [dehydration first aid advice.](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/dehydration)



**4. Limit your alcohol**

The sun is high, and so are many people's spirits. And that can lead us to the pub.

Unfortunately, mixing too much sun with a few too many drinks is not a good combination.

Alcohol causes [dehydration](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/dehydration), which can hit especially hard if your body is already struggling to stay cool in the summer. Drinking alcohol can also make it harder to get a good night's sleep, something that's already difficult in warmer temperatures.  
  
While you may fall asleep quickly, you're likely to have poor-quality sleep and wake up earlier than usual - not exactly the refreshing sleep you'll need. Try to drink in moderation and read more advice on how to [keep cool at night during a heatwave. ](https://www.redcross.org.uk/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/heatwaves-uk/advice-and-tips/keep-cool-night)

 



**5. Eat light meals to feel cooler**

When it's hot, you are far better off sticking to light, well-balanced, regular meals. Food with a high water content like strawberries, cucumber, celery, and lettuce, will also help to keep you hydrated and cool in summer weather.

You can also try foods with high fluid content like soups and stews that contribute towards hydration levels. 



**6. Limit physical activity to cooler parts of the day**

It's important not to disrupt your routine too much because of hot weather, but sometimes you may have to. An early morning run may feel punishing when you're nice and sleepy in bed, but it could be dangerous to exercise in the blazing midday sun and risk [dehydration](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/dehydration), [heat exhaustion, ](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/heat-exhaustion)or [heatstroke](https://www.redcross.org.uk/stories/health-and-social-care/first-aid/first-aid-heatwave).

Take the temperature into consideration when planning your day and, if you can, limit physical activity to when it's cooler. If you do decide to workout or play sport, make sure to drink lots of water and take more breaks than usual to make sure you're not putting any extra stress on your body.

You should also make sure you take a lukewarm or cool shower after exercising to cool down and follow our other advice for staying cool throughout the day.

 

**7. Keep your home cool**

During the hot weather, it’s important to make your home a place you can escape to out of the heat, so keeping it cool is key to feeling comfortable. When temperatures reach heatwave levels this can be more challenging than you may realise and it's not as easy as just opening a window.

Keeping your house cool is especially important at night. During a heatwave temperatures often stay high even at night making it difficult to get a good night's sleep. While it affects everyone in areas affected by a heatwave, people living in high-rise buildings and in urban areas may particularly struggle with this problem. Make sure you're taking steps to keep your home cool and sleeping during a heatwave by following our advice.

* [How to keep cool at night](https://www.redcross.org.uk/get-help/prepare-for-emergencies/heatwaves-uk/advice-and-tips/keep-cool-night)



**8. Know the risks**

The heat can have a serious effect on your physical health, and especially during a heatwave, it's important to look out for signs of heatstroke and heat exhaustion. Many people believe that heat exhaustion and heatstroke are the same things, but heatstroke is potentially far more serious.

[Heat exhaustion](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/heat-exhaustion) is caused when the body loses excess water, salt, and sugars through sweating. It can be treated by having plenty to drink, keeping out of the sun, and knowing how to cool down.

[Heat stroke](https://www.redcross.org.uk/first-aid/learn-first-aid/heatstroke) occurs when the body's temperature becomes dangerously high and the body is no longer able to cool itself. Symptoms include confusion, headache, nausea, and muscle cramps.

Another symptom is paler skin than normal - depending on your skin tone this could mean your skin looks ashen, grey, or a more yellowish hue. It might be easier to notice this change in colour on the palms of hands, nails, or eyes, gums, and tongue.

Heatstroke can develop with little warning and quickly lead to a person becoming unresponsive. It's vital to cool them down as quickly as possible by wrapping them in a wet sheet of clothing and dial 999.

If my inflammation is down my hip gets loose and dislocates and if my inflammation goes up it stays in place, but then I am experiencing inflammation that causes my hair to fall out and my whole body just hates me. I am bloated and exhausted. 

Or I can take 3mg of LDN and get delayed gastric emptying and the first thing I do when I wake up is dry heave. Or if I go up to 4.5mg of LDN I get the inflammation and dumping episodes back. So I can have rapid or delayed gastric emptying, but not anything normal.

Or I can let my MCAS flare happen, and instead of being cold I will be hot af with blood pooling from my POTS in my legs and knees. Either or.

Or what about med contradictions? I am on Famotidine for my MCAS which I take morning and evening. I am also on Levo for my thyroid.

1lrnxlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/story/comments/1lrnxlc/tightening_the_belt/,Tightening the Belt,"The Thompson family had always considered themselves financially responsible—until the day reality hit them like a ton of bricks.  

It started with a casual glance at their bank statement one evening. David Thompson, a middle-aged accountant, sat at the kitchen table, his brow furrowing as he scrolled through their expenses. His wife, Maria, a part-time teacher, leaned over his shoulder, her eyes widening.  

""Did we spend $800 on groceries last month?"" she asked, disbelief colouring her voice.  

David sighed. ""And that’s not even counting the takeout, the random Amazon purchases, and whatever the kids keep charging to our cards.""  

Their two children, Jake (16) and Lily (13), looked up from their phones guiltily. ""I only bought a couple of games,"" Jake muttered.  

And I needed new shoes!"" Lily protested.  

David rubbed his temples. ""We need to talk. We’re not in trouble yet, but we will be if we keep this up.""  

### **The Breaking Point**  

The Thompsons weren’t extravagant; small luxuries had become habits over the years. They added to weekly takeout, subscription services they barely used, and impulse buys. With inflation rising and unexpected car repairs draining their savings, they realised they had to make a change.  

Maria suggested a radical idea: **a no-spend month.** No unnecessary purchases—only essentials like groceries, utilities, and gas. The kids groaned, but David agreed. ""We need to reset our spending habits.""  

### **Week 1: The Honeymoon Phase**  

The first few days were surprisingly easy. Maria meal-planned like a pro, cooking large batches of pasta, soups, and casseroles. David cancelled unused subscriptions—goodbye, streaming services they never watched. Jake and Lily grumbled but survived without new games or clothes.  

Then came the first test.  

Lily’s friends invited her to the mall. ""Can I at least get a smoothie?"" she begged.  

Maria hesitated but stood firm. ""Bring water from home.""  

Lily sulked but went and returned, surprised. ""I didn’t even miss buying anything. We just walked around and talked.""  

### **Week 2: Cracks Appear**  

Jake’s phone screen cracked. Usually, they’d have rushed to replace it, but now they had to think. David found a repair shop that fixed it for half the price of a new phone.  

Then Maria’s coffee machine broke. She nearly caved and bought a new one, but David reminded her, ""We have a French press buried in the cabinet."" She groaned but used it—and admitted the coffee tasted better.  

### **Week 3: Creativity Sparks**  

With no takeout, the family got creative. Jake learned to make pizza from scratch. Lily organised a ""family game night"" with old board games instead of asking for new ones.  

They discovered free activities like hiking, reading library books, and watching movies at home. David even dug out his old guitar and strummed tunes while Maria painted (with supplies she already owned).  

### **Week 4: The Realisation**  

By the end of the month, something unexpected happened—they didn’t miss their old spending habits. Their bank account looked healthier, and they felt more connected as a family.  

When the no-spend challenge ended, they sat down to reassess.  

""We don’t have to live like monks,"" David said, ""but we can be smarter.""  

They agreed on new rules:  
- **Meal planning** to cut grocery waste.  
- **A 24-hour rule** for non-essential purchases.  
- **A family budget meeting** every month.  

          The Aftermath**  

Months later, the Thompsons weren’t just spending less—they were happier. They saved enough for a small vacation (paid in cash). Jake started saving for a car, and Lily sold old clothes online instead of begging for new ones.  

Maria smiled one evening as she looked at their budget. ""Who knew cutting back would give us more?""  

David chuckled. ""The best things in life aren’t things at all.""

I know the bus routes aren't perfect because they're different from before and changing set routines is very difficult. There is issues with it and that's fair to be annoyed by. 

Graham opening is a big change but other cities have similar things and are absolutely loved by the community. 

We as Winnipegers need to allow for change. It's not always going to be perfect. It may be wrong and need to change again. But we need to stop being so negative about everything. Stop hating our downtown and the people who occupy it. We can't have better things if we aren't willing to invest time, presence, and money into it. 

It takes more than just cash to change things people need to show up and use the spaces, the new options and actually fully experience them over time to form a real opinion on it that isn't routed in fear of change. 

Focus on community, go to that random coffee shop you always walk past but never stop in. Buy a book from that niche bookstore. Little things not only will bring you joy but also support our local economy and people. 

Crime happens everywhere. As a frequent user of public transit, and often downtown I have personally never felt unsafe to the point of needing to fear for my life. Obviously things do happen and people give you a weird look or walk a little too close but this isn't unique to only Winnipeg it's global. Crime rates decrease when areas are busy and full of life. Crime hides in the shadows it's easier to get away with things when no one is watching. We can change our statistics and we can have a safer city if only we are willing to be the people to make it happen and not leave it for future generations. 

With all that said it's more fulfilling and you'll overall feel better if you just live with a bit more positive outlook on things . Not everything is awful or the end of the world. Some things aren't perfect and that's okay. Spread more positive thoughts and words and you'll feel good. focusing heavily on negative only you'll feel worse and that's no way to live. 

Truthfully I love this city and the people in it and I just want everyone to feel a little better 💗

Enjoy your summer, have fun at Folk Fest 50th anniversary, Don't forget to check out amazing Fringe shows and all the local markets happening this time of year✨",52,1751648899.0,Winnipeg,21,0.7,False

Spring’s finale has given way to summer in Montclair, bringing a **mix of community buzz and fiscal focus** – all filtered through our whimsical **Acorn Index** of local vitality. As the sun reached its solstice peak on June 21, Montclair’s economy basked in a warm glow: **foot traffic surged** at new marketplaces and festivals, even as residents braced for modest tax hikes. **Acorn Index Update:** Montclair’s Acorn Index held **steady at $1.17**, nudging up from last week’s $1.16 (\~+0.9%). This **stable uptick** signals resilience – **even with a 1.98% municipal tax increase** in the new town budget [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-council-votes-2025-town-budget-see-latest-update#:~:text=The%20spending%20plan%20was%20introduced,its%20property%20taxes%2C%20administrators%20said), **robust business openings** and **cheerful community spending** kept our acorn rolling.

# ACB (Acorn Commerce & Business) 🐿️💼

Local **businesses were bustling**, showing a whole **bushel of activity** in Montclair’s downtown and beyond. The headline of the week was the **grand reopening of Lackawanna Station** on June 21 – a historic train station transformed into an **indoor marketplace** now home to **20+ new small and “micro” businesses** [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/indoor-market-brings-new-life-lackawanna-station-montclair#:~:text=MONTCLAIR%2C%20NJ%20%E2%80%94%20There%E2%80%99s%20new,historic%20train%20station%20in%20Montclair).

It’s been nearly a decade since this landmark buzzed with commerce, and its revival (open 7 days a week, 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.) represents a **major acorn stash for local entrepreneurs** [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/indoor-market-brings-new-life-lackawanna-station-montclair#:~:text=MONTCLAIR%2C%20NJ%20%E2%80%94%20There%E2%80%99s%20new,historic%20train%20station%20in%20Montclair).

Elsewhere in town, **culinary acorns are sprouting**. Upper Montclair is getting sweeter with **Somedays Bakery** opening its doors at 260 Bellevue Avenue on June 27 [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=match%20at%20L193%20Somedays%20Bakery%2C,Click%20here%20for%20more). The Queens-founded patisserie – known for its premium croissants and La Colombe coffee – is celebrating with a grand opening (8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) and *free soft-serve ice cream* for the first 100 guests [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/somedays-bakery-opening-new-location-montclair-heres-what-menu#:~:text=Somedays%20Bakery%20will%20be%20holding,to%20the%20first%20100%20guests). Meanwhile, on Church Street, the popular **Acorn General Store** (yes, named appropriately) partnered with Propagate Studio to launch a *pay-what-you-can* art supply outpost, inviting creative locals to pick up paints and brushes at *“take what you need”* pricing [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Photo%20Credit%3A%20Montclair%20Indoor%20Golf)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Indoor%20Golf%20Club%20has,shared%20with%20The%20Montclair%20Girl). And for fans of global flavors, a new Vietnamese café **Bánh Voyage** is on the horizon – the team behind Montclair’s Local Coffee announced plans to open this eatery (in the former Da Pepo space at 54 Fairfield Street) within the next few weeks [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-15-2025/#:~:text=Kevin%20Zaballero%20and%20Deborah%20Wang%2C,newest%20business%20venture%3A%20a%20Vietnamese). From flaky croissants to phở and art canvases, Montclair’s **small business scene is humming**, with entrepreneurs busily **squirreling away success** for the summer season.

It’s also been a week of **boosters and grants** for local commerce. The **Montclair Indoor Golf Club** scored a **$37,351 NJEDA Small Business Lease Grant** to help cover its space on Walnut Street [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Indoor%20Golf%20Club%20has,shared%20with%20The%20Montclair%20Girl). *“The grant has given us breathing room to invest in our space and improve what we offer to the community,”* owner James Vukanovich said gratefully [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Montclair%20Indoor%20Golf%20Club%20has,shared%20with%20The%20Montclair%20Girl). And in a show of philanthropic nuts and bolts, the Montclair Foundation awarded $90K in community grants to local nonprofits (from a music education group to a community farm) – ensuring that as businesses thrive, Montclair’s charitable core does too [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-council-votes-2025-town-budget-see-latest-update#:~:text=Community%20Corner). **Bottom line:** the **Acorn Business Fund** is strong. New shops and eateries are **popping up like oak saplings**, helped along by a mix of community enthusiasm and strategic support. Montclair’s commercial district is alive, well, and delighting locals – one new storefront at a time.

# ACT (Art & Tech – The Nutty Side) 🎨🤖

Montclair’s creative and tech scenes **embraced some quirk** this week – call it **“nutty tech”** with a playful twist. At Montclair State University’s Yogi Berra Museum & Learning Center, a new **AI-driven art installation** stepped up to the plate, blending technology with nostalgia. Titled *“The Great American Pastime: Berra and the Bronx Legends,”* the exhibit uses **immersive audio and artificial intelligence** to simulate classic baseball radio broadcasts [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=). Visitors can experience eight different legendary Yankees games generated from historical data – a high-tech homage to Yogi and his era that brings sports history to life in a whole new way. It’s a hit with museum-goers and techies alike, proving that even in a baseball town, Montclair can get delightfully geeky.

Tech is also preserving Montclair’s own history. The **Montclair History Center** announced the launch of its new **Online Collections Portal**, a digital trove where local researchers (and curious squirrels) can browse artifacts from the town’s past [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-22-2025/#:~:text=Image%3A%20merchandise%20montclair%20new%20jersey,montclair%20history%20center). Decades of Montclair memories – old maps, vintage postcards, quilts, oral histories, even Montclair High School football archives – are now accessible with a few clicks. More collections will be added in coming months (look out for the Montclair Ambulance Unit records and some magic lantern slides)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-22-2025/#:~:text=Since%20Fall%202024%2C%20the%20Montclair,Unit%20and%20Lantern%20Slide%20Collection). This project has been in the works since last fall, and its debut means *history buffs can explore Montclair’s heritage from the comfort of home*. In true Montclair fashion, **innovation and preservation** go hand in hand: cutting-edge digitization is being used to **honor our town’s roots**. From AI baseball games to virtual archives, Montclair showed this week that **tech and culture make a fine mixed bag of nuts**.

# ACE (Acorn Education & Community) 🎓🌱

The end of the school year might be here, but **education news in Montclair** didn’t take a summer break. First, a carry-over from spring’s dramas: the former Montclair teacher accused of making online threats that shut down schools in January will face his day in court. Having rejected a no-jail plea deal, the ex-teacher (Amir Doctry) is now slated for a **jury trial in November**, facing charges of terroristic threats related to the social media scare [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-22-2025/#:~:text=Trial%20in%20November). It’s an alarming saga that had disrupted mid-winter classes, but the upcoming trial promises closure – and a lesson in accountability – for the community. In the meantime, Montclair’s schools are **shoring up safety and transparency**. After a tumultuous budget season revealed nearly $5.8 million in unpaid bills by the district, the Board of Education is moving forward with new fiscal oversight (and a new business administrator as of July 1). Parents continue to call for a forensic audit of school finances [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=clouds%20and%20silver%20linings,But%20on%20the%20bright%20side)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=tumultuous%20budget%20season%20and%20revelations,the%202025%C2%A0Judy%20Weston%20Awards%20for) – a *necessary shake of the tree* to ensure our educational acorns are managed properly.

On a brighter note, Montclair’s educators and institutions gave us **reasons to cheer**. The Montclair Public Library rolled out a heartwarming initiative, inviting residents to **share their immigration stories** as part of an oral history project to reflect the town’s diversity [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=Residents%20Invited%20to%20Share%20Immigration,Stories%20with%20Montclair%20Public%20Library). Through the “Making History Together” program, families can submit personal tales of coming to Montclair – enriching the library’s local history collection with voices that too often go unheard. And just in time for summer reading, Montclair schools honored their finest: **16 outstanding teachers and 1 counselor** received this year’s Judy Weston Awards for Inspired Teaching, recognizing those who went above and beyond in our classrooms [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=montclairlocal,acorns%20of%20knowledge%20continue%20to). From innovative science projects to compassionate counseling, these honorees proved that **Montclair’s acorns of knowledge** continue to grow, nurtured by some truly dedicated “gardeners” (teachers). **In short:**amid a few challenges, Montclair’s educational community remains **strong and ever-learning**, blending hard lessons with inspiring achievements.

# LUX (Lifestyle & Leisure) 🌇🍦

Montclair **luxuriated in early-summer life** this week, with residents out and about enjoying the long days (and trying to stay cool!). **Pride Month** festivities continued to reverberate – Montclair is still basking in the success of the big Montclair Pride Festival earlier this month, which drew thousands of revelers downtown in a rainbow wave of music, art, and business for local shops. Not to be outdone, **Juneteenth celebrations** took center stage during our week. On June 19, Montclair raised the Juneteenth flag at Town Hall for the first time, commemorating the end of slavery and kicking off several days of events [montclairlocal.news](https://montclairlocal.news/2025/06/free-before-we-know-it-montclair-raises-juneteenth-flag-for-first-time-video/#:~:text=The%20flag%20raising%20was%20among,Brewery%20June%2019%20%E2%80%93%2022). The **Friends of the Howe House** (an African American historic home in Montclair) hosted a cocktail fundraiser on June 20 and a family festival on June 21 at Nishuane Park – complete with music, food, and performances – and saw a *“big turnout”* from the community [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/big-turnout-montclair-s-howe-house-juneteenth-events#:~:text=Last%20week%E2%80%99s%20events%20included%20a,on%20the%20James%20Howe%20House)[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/big-turnout-montclair-s-howe-house-juneteenth-events#:~:text=after%20a%20successful%20pair%20of,the%20Juneteenth%20holiday%2C%20organizers%20say). Organizers reported that the support was *“overwhelming,”* and the funds raised will help secure the future of the historic James Howe House on Claremont Avenue [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/big-turnout-montclair-s-howe-house-juneteenth-events#:~:text=MONTCLAIR%2C%20NJ%20%E2%80%94%20The%20future,the%20Juneteenth%20holiday%2C%20organizers%20say)[patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/big-turnout-montclair-s-howe-house-juneteenth-events#:~:text=Last%20week%E2%80%99s%20events%20included%20a,on%20the%20James%20Howe%20House). Between Pride and Juneteenth, June has been **bursting with community spirit** – and local businesses reaped the benefits, from vendors at Nishuane Park selling barbeque to downtown boutiques offering celebratory sales.

Of course, not everything was breezy: a **mini heatwave** hit Essex County late in the week. Newark tied its all-time June high temperature (first set in 1943) as thermometers flirted with the triple digits [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=Newark%20climate%20site%20tied%20its,NWS). Montclair felt the sizzle too, sending folks scrambling for cold drinks and ice cream. (The line at Gelati by the Lake was almost as long as on Free Cone Day!) Despite the *acorn-roasting* heat, our town kept its cool with **evening outdoor dining** in full swing and the **Montclair Art Museum’s Free First Thursday Nights** drawing art lovers into air-conditioned galleries. And in a fun *brush with fame*, locals at Rand Park were treated to a surprise celebrity sighting: **actor Adam Sandler** – yes, of *Happy Gilmore* and *Big Daddy* fame – was spotted playing pickup basketball on June 22 [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=Adam%20Sandler%20Spotted%20Playing%20Basketball,in%20Montclair). A TikTok video of Sandler shooting hoops in Montclair racked up nearly a million views [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=On%20June%2022nd%2C%20Adam%20Sandler,reached%20almost%20one%20million%20views), proving that our quiet suburbs can still serve up some viral excitement. (No word on whether Sandler grabbed a bagel at Hot Bagels Abroad afterward, but one can dream.)

Montclair’s **wildlife** even got in on the action. Nearby Verona had an unexpected visitor – a **black bear** wandering through a residential neighborhood on June 19 [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=Image). Local officials put out tips on what to do if you encounter a bear (hint: *do not* offer it an acorn latte). While the bruin ultimately moved along, some Montclair residents joked that our **squirrel overlords** had better hide their acorn stockpiles! 🐻🐿️ In more domestic news, Montclair’s **parks and pools** are open and busy. Children are chasing fireflies in Edgemont Park at dusk, couples are picnicking under Watchung Plaza’s shady trees, and the Montclair Community Band gave a rousing free concert at Anderson Park to kick off the summer season. All told, the **quality of life in Montclair** remains rich and vibrant – even as the mercury rises, we find ways to come together, celebrate culture, and enjoy the small luxuries of our town.

# GRR (Green Roots Revival) 🌳🌱

Montclair’s **green initiatives** continued to take root and grow stronger this week. If you wander through our leafy neighborhoods, you might notice teams of young people peering up at the branches – those are the **Montclair State University “Green Team” interns**, and they’ve embarked on a mission to map and enhance our **urban tree canopy**. As part of PSEG’s Institute for Sustainability summer program, students are analyzing which parts of town have ample shade and which could use more greenery [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=University%20students%20kicked%20off%20summer,Montclair%E2%80%99s%C2%A0Twocents%C2%A0feedback%20app%20and%20various%20coding). The goal? To ensure **“tree canopy equity”** – that every Montclair neighborhood, from the leafy estates of Upper Montclair to the denser blocks near Glenfield, shares in the cooling comfort of trees [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=University%20students%20kicked%20off%20summer,Montclair%E2%80%99s%C2%A0Twocents%C2%A0feedback%20app%20and%20various%20coding)[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=environmental%20tech%20projects%20across%20North,watch%20%E2%80%93%20quietly%20growing%20and). With climate change bringing hotter summers (as we saw this week), this work couldn’t be timelier. Even the local squirrels are paying close attention – rumor has it they’re already **speculating on which streets will have the plushest acorn harvests** once new trees are planted!

Beyond our urban forest, Montclair is doubling down on **sustainability and resilience**. The township remains an active leader in the new multi-town flood mitigation task force, teaming up with neighbors to address regional stormwater issues (a lingering memory after remnants of Hurricane Ida swamped us in 2021). At home, the **Office of Sustainability** is building on spring’s momentum: community garden tours are being planned for later this summer, the weekly farmer’s market is thriving with Jersey Fresh produce, and Montclair’s expanded compost drop-off program is turning food scraps into black gold (fertilizer) for local gardeners. In fact, the town just added a second compost site at the Walnut Street train station lot – making it even easier for residents to go green. *No dramatic new ordinances passed this week,* but the **cumulative progress** is clear: with each rain barrel distributed and each electric vehicle charger installed, Montclair’s **“green roots”** are growing deeper. Our community’s eco-economy is steadily (and sustainably) strengthening, one sapling and solar panel at a time.

# SQRL (Squirrel Infrastructure & Housing) 🏗️🏠

When it comes to the **nuts and bolts of Montclair’s economy** – infrastructure, development, and housing – this week saw steady movement and a few cautionary tales. First up, Montclair’s long-awaited **senior center** has hit a temporary snag. Construction of the 4,100-square-foot facility (inside the Mills Building at 60 South Fullerton) **stalled this month**due to an unexpected structural quirk [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=Renovations%20Stop%20at%20Montclair%20Senior,Center). The developer, BDP Holdings LLC, discovered that some internal stairs and a hallway didn’t meet code, halting work until a fix is found [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=two%20gender,resume%20in%20the%20coming%20months). The center was slated to bring our seniors new offices, community rooms, and accessible bathrooms. While this **pause is frustrating**, officials are optimistic construction will **resume in coming months** once design solutions are in place [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=two%20gender,resume%20in%20the%20coming%20months). In the meantime, Montclair’s older residents still have the Edgemont Park House and library programs to keep active – the *silver squirrels* of our community remain resourceful as ever.

In the realm of real estate, Montclair continues to experience **acorn-fueled demand**. A notable development in the heart of downtown – a **partially built 74-unit apartment building at 65 Church Street** – hit the market seeking new investors [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-22-2025/#:~:text=Partially%20Built%20Rental%20Unit%20in,Montclair%20Hits%20the%20Market). The project (65% complete, with approvals for a 2,400 sq. ft. public plaza and rooftop amenities) could be a prime opportunity for a developer with vision [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-22-2025/#:~:text=Partially%20Built%20Rental%20Unit%20in,Montclair%20Hits%20the%20Market). Its current owner is looking to sell, meaning we might see fresh ideas (and capital) injected to finish the job. Montclair’s housing market has been *red-hot* recently, so there’s a good chance a buyer will bite. Meanwhile, over in the First Ward, **historic homes are commanding eye-popping prices**: a **19th-century estate on Valley Road** (built in the 1840s by a founding Montclair family) was listed last month for **$1.94 million** [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Historic%2019th%20Century%20Montclair%20Home,Listed%20for%20Sale). Steep? Sure – but it underscores Montclair’s status as one of North Jersey’s most desirable towns. Spacious homes, rich history, proximity to NYC – it’s the kind of package that keeps **home values at lofty levels** (Realtor.com recently ranked nearby Nutley #34 of the hottest U.S. markets [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/belleville/nutley-mayor-gives-state-township-speech-development-updates-town-milestones#:~:text=Kelly%20said%20that%20Nutley%E2%80%99s%20housing,%E2%80%9D), and Montclair isn’t far behind).

On the infrastructure front, the township is **investing in future-proofing assets**. The long-neglected Clary Anderson Ice Arena is on the road to renewal after the council approved new management and an initial $1 million for urgent repairs [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=Updates%20on%20the%20Clary%20Anderson,Aside%20%241%20Million%20for%20Repairs)[themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-8-2025/#:~:text=contract,the%20state%E2%80%99s%20Local%20Finance%20Board). Over 170 sidewalk segments around town got repair notices under Montclair’s new ordinance – a push to eliminate stubbed toes and stroller hazards on our sidewalks[reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=crews%20and%20planners%20stayed%20busy%3A,next%20generation%20of%20community%20assets). And Montclair officials are advancing plans to deploy **$4.6 million from the Affordable Housing Trust Fund** towards creating new lower-income homes over the next decade [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=170%20repair%20notices%20issued%20to,in%20its%20physical%20infrastructure%C2%A0and%C2%A0future%20livability). Ideas on the table include developing town-owned lots and incentivizing developers to include affordable units – all part of making sure Montclair stays economically diverse even as property values climb. All told, this week Montclair **invested in its physical foundation and future livability**. From **fixing stairs and sidewalks** to **financing homes**, the SQRL index of growth-by-investment remains strong – our town is building (and rebuilding) the next generation of community assets.

# Outlook: Acorns to Watch 🔮🌰

Looking ahead, Montclair’s economic **outlook appears steady** with a chance of fireworks – literally! As the Fourth of July approaches, the town is gearing up for its beloved **Independence Day Parade and Family Picnic**, returning on July 4th after last year’s hiatus [themontclairgirl.com](https://www.themontclairgirl.com/montclair-essex-county-news-june-29-2025/#:~:text=,montclaircenter). The holiday festivities (a 1.6-mile parade route with bands and floats, ending in Edgemont Park for an afternoon picnic) are expected to draw big crowds and **inject a burst of spending** into local eateries, food trucks, and shops. This seasonal boost – along with summer sales and *sidewalk chalk* promotions – should keep our **Acorn Index hovering in the mid-$1.teens**. In fact, don’t be surprised if it **ticks up slightly** next week as patriotic spirit loosens wallets and purses.

On the policy front, with the **2025 municipal budget passed** and tax rates set [patch.com](https://patch.com/new-jersey/montclair/montclair-council-votes-2025-town-budget-see-latest-update#:~:text=The%20spending%20plan%20was%20introduced,its%20property%20taxes%2C%20administrators%20said), Montclair’s leaders will turn to implementation. *Keep an eye on* progress to reopen Fire Station #3 in the Fourth Ward (funded in the new budget [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedailysquirrel/comments/1ld3ljo/montclairs_acorn_economy_week_of_june_5_12_2025/#:~:text=Montclair%E2%80%99s%20public%20health%20and%20safety,just%20making%20sure%20first%20responders)) – a move that will improve emergency response times by fall. We also anticipate updates on the Clary Anderson Arena: the council’s plan to convert it into a self-sustaining utility awaits state approval, but once green-lit, contractors could start long-term renovations (no more leaky roof, please). Over in the Board of Education, summer will be a time to recruit a permanent School Business Administrator and rebuild trust through financial transparency. **Accountability acorns** planted now may yield steadier school budgets by next year.

In community life, Montclair’s **summer arts and culture** will continue to flourish. **Outdoor concerts** and film screenings are on tap – Montclair Film is rumored to host a movie night at Lackawanna Plaza later in July, and the Montclair Jazz Festival’s big downtown jamboree looms in September as the season’s grand finale. The **farmers’ market** will hit peak bounty in coming weeks (get ready for Jersey tomatoes and sweet corn), sustaining our *local food economy* and picnic baskets alike. And environmentally, those MSU Green Team interns will be compiling their tree data, likely presenting the town with recommendations by August – paving the way for grants to plant new trees come fall. If their findings show any shade disparities, expect Montclair to respond by literally **growing its equity** (one oak at a time).

All things considered, Montclair enters July with **momentum and cautious optimism**. The economy here is **grounded in community** – when neighbors rally around causes like Howe House, patronize a new bakery, or simply come together for summer fun, it creates a virtuous cycle that keeps our town thriving. So as we toast to Independence Day with fireworks and backyard barbecues, take a moment to appreciate the little acorns of progress all around us. From **new businesses** to **old traditions**, they’re the nuts that make Montclair’s **“Acorn Economy”** something to celebrate. *Happy summer, Montclair – and watch out for those resourceful squirrels in your garden!* 🐿️🎆

1lrnu4s,https://i.redd.it/s1tzszyn2waf1.jpeg,"During a chilly night backstage after a chaotic show in San Francisco in 1967, Janis Joplin sat cross-legged on a battered couch, nursing a bottle of Southern Comfort","Across the room, Ronald ""Pigpen"" McKernan tuned his battered harmonica, the roughness of his denim jacket brushing against the wall. Their eyes met, two exhausted souls recognizing something familiar in each other, an unspoken ache that fame had only made worse.

Both were rising stars in their own right, Janis with ""Big Brother and the Holding Company,"" Pigpen with the ""Grateful Dead."" Yet the roaring crowds, endless parties, and swirling chaos of the late 1960s music scene often left them feeling more isolated than celebrated. Where others sought louder highs, flashier nights, Janis and Pigpen gravitated toward the old comfort of blues music and the kind of simple, heartfelt connection that could not be faked.

Their friendship formed quietly but firmly. They would often slip away from the wild parties where acid and bravado were currency, finding shelter in dark corners where Pigpen would play old blues standards on his harmonica and Janis would hum along, her voice rough and tender. There were nights when they would sit outside the Fillmore Auditorium, sharing a cigarette, talking about their favorite artists, Bessie Smith for Janis, Lightnin' Hopkins for Pigpen. Both carried a reverence for the raw honesty of blues, something the psychedelic explosion around them seemed to drown out.

One night after a marathon Grateful Dead set, Pigpen found Janis crying alone behind a row of amplifiers. She had just fought with her bandmates, frustrated over creative decisions that felt like a betrayal of the music she loved. Without a word, Pigpen sat down next to her, pulling out his harmonica and softly playing ""Trouble in Mind."" The mournful notes wrapped around her anger, quieting it, soothing her in a way no conversation could. Janis leaned her head on his shoulder, and for a while, they said nothing, letting the music speak every word they could not.

Janis found rare gentleness in Pigpen. While others around her were often intoxicated by their own rising fame or consumed with the trappings of success, Pigpen remained grounded, uncomfortable with the limelight, anchored by a love for authenticity. He was never one to judge her for her explosive emotions or wild energy. He understood too well what it meant to feel like a misfit among revolutionaries.

They often spent early mornings at Pigpen’s modest apartment, far from the Haight-Ashbury crowds, spinning scratched records of Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. The worn-out carpet, the lingering smell of coffee and cigarettes, the battered guitar propped against the wall, it was a far cry from the glitzy world they were supposed to inhabit. Janis once told a friend that being with Pigpen was like ""being back home where nobody expected you to be anything but yourself.""

Their connection also carried a profound melancholy. Both battled inner demons that neither fame nor friendship could fully heal. Janis wrestled with a desperate need for love and validation that fame only intensified. Pigpen, whose health was already fragile from years of hard drinking, often looked older than his years, his once robust voice giving way to hoarse whispers by the end of long nights. Yet when they were together, they created a space where none of that mattered, where the pressure to be legends faded, and they could just be two kids who loved the blues.

When Janis left for a solo career, and Pigpen’s role in the ""Grateful Dead"" shifted as the band’s sound evolved, their paths began to diverge. Yet even from a distance, the bond remained. Friends recalled late-night phone calls where they would swap stories, or brief reunions backstage where they would fall into each other's arms, laughing over old jokes nobody else remembered.

In a world that prized spectacle and revolution, Janis Joplin and Pigpen found in each other something infinitely rarer, a quiet understanding, a reminder that fame could not replace the need for genuine human connection. Their friendship stood as a testament to the idea that even in the loudest, wildest eras, true souls still managed to find each other and hold on.

In a time when everyone seemed determined to burn out brighter and faster, Janis and Pigpen offered each other the simple, sacred gift of being seen.",8,1751648667.0,grateful_dead,1,0.79,False
1lrntus,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1lrntus/socially_anxious_and_needing_advice_on_how_to/,Socially anxious and needing advice on how to deal with co-tenants in a shared space.,"I need advice on responding to a fellow renter who I haven’t spoken to yet.

My wife and I live in a two-story detached building (duplex) that is rented out to four separate families: we are on the first floor, there is a three-bedroom unit above us, and the basement is divided and rented to two separate tenants. In terms of outdoor space: There is a small patio space which is largely in front of our living room window that faces the street, the upstairs neighbors have a balcony that faces the backyard, and the backyard itself is a small courtyard space which happens to be the only entrance for the two basement units. All units have access to the backyard.

My wife and I have lived here longer than the other renters. A group of three young post-grads began moving in this week (I haven’t met them yet), and there is also a new basement tenant who moved in a few weeks ago (whom I also haven’t met.) I texted the one other tenant that I do know (Person A) about a week ago, asking if he or the new guy (Person B) at the time had ordered delivery, because there was a food order left outside my back door. Person A responded that he hadn’t but offered to text his new downstairs neighbor to see if he had, and he also told me he would ask Person B if it would be alright for me to receive his phone number.

I didn’t receive a text from Person B until this morning, and it was a small introduction followed by a request to use our patio space (something to the effect of “Hi, I’m Person B, and I don’t think we’ve met but anyway, how do you feel about me sitting at your table? I like to sit outside and have a coffee and it’s a much nicer space than out back.”) I received this message after I just put a new bistro umbrella out yesterday.

I get that it’s (kind of?) nice he asked, but I’m frustrated. Firstly, I spent two hours yesterday cleaning up the front and backyard. They get massively overgrown during the summer, and I have been the only person to manage it as long as my wife and I’ve lived here. I started doing this because she and I have two dogs that we occasionally let into the backyard , supervised, to pee or sniff around. That said, both basement renters also have dogs. In addition to that, we’ve previously been made uncomfortable by other neighbors using our patio furniture, particularly late at night during get-togethers, etc. etc. It’s not like they’re sitting on the stoops in front of our apartment doors — they’re literally right outside our window, so we either have to keep the windows closed or deal with feeling like we’re on display.

I also get that the patio is shared space, but a) the upstairs renters have their private balcony, b) the basement renters have space in the backyard to put their own furniture out and knew the layout of the space before they signed a lease, and c) it’s understood that I’m the one that does the yard work to make the spaces as nice as I can. I would like to think someone wanting a more useable space would make some attempt at it.

AITA for being offended? I don’t “people” but I think I’m a nice person and know I can be a pushover. It just feels strange to think of telling someone that I’d rather that they not use my furniture, if for no other reason than not wanting to be unable to personally use it because someone else is there. Is there a better way to respond to Person B’s request?",1,1751648647.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

Alrighty, gonna go over my last couple years of my life and look for insight on what to do or how to navigate my feelings without gas lighting myself into thinking being treated like this is okay because I was unemployed 

I met my gf around the end of 2023. Things were great we hit it off so well it felt like I met my soul mate. I’m very anxious and not a very social person at all. And every date I had before the one with her I felt uncomfortable and I never thought about a 2nd date. Not the case with my gf I was head over heels. 

A month later I ended up slipping a disk in my back, I started doing physio therapy for 6 months with wcb, after that I was deemed unfit to return to my old job in plumbing because of my back getting better in that time. So we transitioned to physio 2x a week and started doing job searching with wcb. 

During this time in our relationship it would have been around June/ July. My girlfriend would invite me over to her place every single night, her place being halfway to my physio and me being over the moon for her of course I went went called. It definitely turned into me living with her before we knew it. But I was not on a lease or contributing at this point as I did not have a job nor did I think about the idea that I was kinda moving in with her. More and more of my clothes and personal items would come. House sit while she’s w her mom driving to another province. 

This is where it gets kinda shitty. 

My gf at the time told me from the start that her parents have been paying her rent for her to go to school. Which I thought was cool and wild but she wasn’t in school or ever enlisted. For 5 years… I also found out later that they were paying for her rent because she had pretty bad bi polar or something along those lines ( very big mood swings and a little crazy when she snaps) her parents wanted to keep the peace apparently and paying for her rent was easier then helping there daughter 

Around this point her friend and parents were a little upset that she was dating someone without a job and felt like I was free loading and a leach. And that’s where we started to argue about money and roles and me not having a job. And it’s been kinda down hill since then. Around the time I was done my 6 month physio with wcb. I did start to buy groceries. I was the only one cleaning, cooking, doing dishes, taking care of her cat. I was kinda a stay at home husband in between physio appointments. 

This turned into resentment and fights and me not doing enough and her hating me for it. I don’t know if this matters but every women in her life is heavily financially taken care of by there male partner. None of her sisters grandmas or her mom work since they were In there 20s. Her best friend as well. It got to the point where her entire family would ignore me, would ignore any attempt at conversation ignore simple hellos. Talk to me in the 3rd person “ can you let you bf know “ while I’m standing right next to both of them. Or her friend and bf asking me “oh how’s work going did you work today?” Knowing that I lost my job, my back is not as strong as it was. And I am trying to change Carrers to something that is suited for my back. 

6 months goes by. We’re into 2024 Januaryfebuarry, I’m still heavily in love and obsessed with this woman despite the arguments and bullying about not having a job or being able to contribute. 

The less agreement is coming up and my gf and her mom talked about it and they were going to rent the appartment for another year. A week goes by and her parents wanted to meet with her about the lease. And told her that they weren’t going to pay for it anymore with her dad coming home from work. And that she would need to move home. My gf was a wreck completely devastated. She liked the life and small home that we made at the appartment. She didn’t like the idea of moving home to somewhere she isn’t wanted or welcomed knowing they paid her rent to get her out of the house for them more than to help her. They started arguing a lot and ended up going to family therapy.

For some reason that I still don’t know why. In the middle of the week. After work. After doing family therapy for weeks after knowing you’re losing your home. She reached out to her ex from when she was 18/19 just to catch up? I’ll never know what they talked about. She came upstairs from a phone call she said she had with her friend. She was being weird about it and her friend goes to bed early at all the time so I asked to see the call log of over an hour and that’s when she broke down crying saying I fucked up. Tried telling me bits and pieces of it. Called the guy and he tried telling me that it was just catching up. He has no interest in my gf. He is 4 hours away from blah blah blah. I left raging. Went back for some reason to get reassurance to find out she called him back crying because she felt bad and thought that she lost me forever. I lost it even more and had a mini panic attack I’m not sure what to call it. My heart was going 100mph couldn’t breathe shaking like a tree. I feel like I blacked out because I don’t remember much after that. We fought argued I called her names was probably pretty mean. The only 3 excuses I got from it were, the memories of dates they went on was nice and she tried to blame my effort and lack of date. She was lonely with her best friend constantly talking shit she doesn’t have anyone else in her life she can talk to. Other than her one friend and her mom. And the 3rd being that she was acting out because she was losing her home and I didn’t have a job to help out and she felt like she was drowning and wanted advice and to talk about it. I was blamed for not making her feel special enough. Taking or planning dates. Being romantic. Not buying her gifts or not having the ability to do these things because I don’t have a job. And I fell for it I apologized my ass off. Said it would change. Made her a jar of date coupons that was Colour coded for budget. I did think the whole time the me taking care of her was my little version of a date. Going to get groceries was a date. Going to the farmers market or staying up late laughing watching tv. Cooking for her while she sits plays video games and talks to me. All of that shit I was in love I had huge heart eyes. I don’t need a restaurant or an expensive activity all the time when I get more enjoyment out of those little things at home. I don’t know if i genuinely am appreciating the little things or if i took it for granted and should have done more. 

After this i became the problem. I couldn’t let it go. I would bring it up all the time. It would keep me up at night. Trying to find the guy online or find anything about it that would explain why I wasn’t good enough to be loyal too. I would pick fights. Look into shit like a detective and make something out of nothing. Take things out of context. 

Now we both feel wronged. She’s dating a guy with no job or no ambition to go out and get one. And I am trying to build a life and give love to someone that has been hateful and emotionally cheated on me. Life goes on and come summer we move out. The plan to stay at my parents place as they had an entire mother in law suite that wasn’t in use. That was the plan until we had the apartment cleared out and all her stuff was packed up. Then she informs me that she will not be moving with me but going home. And that we aren’t going to be seeing much of each other anymore because her family’s opinion on me. 

Sleeping alone became incredibly hard while we were dating. Falling asleep on the couch when we’d argue cause I’m locked out or told to stay away was something that I couldn’t stand. I’m very co dependent person and I believe that my gf is as well. From when I stayed the first night I don’t think we spent more than one day apart from each other at a time. And as the relationship went on that habit and routine of sleeping next to someone was built. And when we were talking  about moving that was one of the biggest things for me that I was worried about and moving in w me and my family was all good untill that point. 

I started having a mental collapse, the girl that I love with everything dosent want anything to do with me. She wants this other guy. She dosent wanna live with me. She dosent wanna try. She wants to change her mind last minute. I even saw a text she sent her friend saying “ idk what to do I need help moving but feel like im stuck “ I was devastated and couldn’t stop crying and being depressed for 2 months. 

I’ll give her credit she was there almost every day despite saying she wasn’t going to be or I was with her. Her family chilled out a bit and would let me into there house. Eventually after 6 month would let me stay a night out of the month. At my family house she was open arms welcomed into the home so we eventually just spent more time at my house. 

During this time, our sex life dropped. Which I get cause we’re living at home with our parents. But I’m talking 0 attempt. 0 initiation. When we would have the house to ourselves she wouldn’t be interested. Would tell me that she is unattracted to me because I have no job. If she were to get pregnant her baby daddy would be a bum. She is so checked out if she tries to that she grosses herself out by think about dumb shit or other people. This went on from last summer untill now. Our sex life went from me begging her to stop and give me a chance to breathe to me begging and being told no I am using pussy as a motivation tool. 

Life goes on from that and come November. A different ex reaches out to her randomly while she’s at work. She answers the call cause she dosent know who it is. They talked for a bit and at the end of the conversation she did say that she had a bf and was in a relationship and shouldn’t be talking to exes. Said goodbye and blocked. However she did save a Snapchat video of her talking to the camera that she sent to her best friend. Saying she answered a call. Talked for a little bit. Realized it was wrong. Then started bawling her eyes out that she broke up with that kid when they were 18 cause he didn’t have a job and she thought he was a loser and she thought she could get a doctor or a lawyer or something like that. And know she’s 23 dating another boy who dosent have a job. While she broke up with this sweetest boy in highschool. More so attacking herself kinda I guess for being “silly”? But me watching and hearing those words over and over are etched into my brain. Apparently it’s my fault and that I should have went looking. It was the first video/ picture that came up when your in the camera app not even photos. The little preview box in the bottom corner. I seen a video of my beautiful gf recording herself and no shit I wanted to see her. But wasn’t expecting to be fucking tanked like that. 

Life goes on a couple months. I am back to work at this point. Making money getting my car and phone and my life back on track. And again I find something on her phone. She searched from the main search bar on the iPhone “why do I feel giddy for someone that isn’t my boyfriend” and here we are again. Apparently some guy comes into her work and there’s something about him that gives her butterflies that she can’t control and wanted to look into it by googling it. I find it stupid and I don’t believe that it was innocent was it was made to be. And the fact that this is happening at work and there’s nothing I can do. AND having sex denied and that type of affection denied while someone else is getting woed. It fucked me up.

Life goes on 6 months. By grandfather is selling his house and offers me to buy it at a discounted price. It was an offer that was too good to pass up so I acted on it. Thinking that buying a house would save the relationship. Make my girlfriend not hate me and love me again. Make her find me attractive again. She’s hesitant about it and I am full speed ahead. Ended up buying house 2 months later. 

Now present day. I’m sitting in my bathroom at 6am typing this out. Trying to understand my feeling. It’s been the 3rd argument this week about me bringing up old shit. She dosent wanna come to bed with me ? She must be staying up late to talk to dudes. She dosent wanna Wake up with me ? How long was she talking to her dudes for. She leaves 10 min earlier than usual for work to grab coffee. Is there a guy getting her coffee ? She dosent wanna have sex ? Must be thinking about other guys. Dosent wanna help out around the house ? She must still think she can walk over me. Every. Single. Little. Thing. That I could possibly tie into her cheating I am. And it is ruining my life at this point. I can’t get it out of my head. I will wake up having a panic attack when she comes to bed late because I can’t stop thinking about her staying up to talk to people. I can’t get it the fuck out of my head no matter how hard I cry get mad talk about it to her or friends nothings working anymore. 

I finally have the life I wanted. I have the foundation that she wanted. I have the security and conquered everyone talking shit and saying she was wasting her time. I proved them wrong and I proved her wrong for believing them. Moving into this house was suppose to be the fresh page. No resentment no old feelings. I don’t know why I was able to deal with them so much better up until this point. And now I can’t stop thinking about living a life where I don’t rust her and I don’t stop checking her phone. I’m not always paranoid and wondering

Honestly. If you made it this far I appreciate it. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel incredibly lost and alone. I feel like I am slipping into a depression again and I am worried that I am going to lose motivation for anything. I am worried that I am going to have another mental collapse where all I do is cry for 2-3 months straight. Or that I push past it make it work and a year, 5, 10 years passes and something happens again. I am not strong enough to go through this heartbreak again. I am way too sensitive and have huge feelings and I don’t know what to do. 

Any advice or a light conversation to not feel alone would be very appreciated ❤️ ",1,1751648557.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

Hello everyone,

My husband (28M) and I (27F) have been in Canada for about two years now, and while we're loving it here, we've realized our social circle is pretty small. We're looking to meet other couples who might be in a similar situation – perhaps new to the country or just looking to expand their social life!

We're open to all sorts of activities, whether it's grabbing coffee, trying out new restaurants, exploring the city, board game nights, or just casual hangouts. We're friendly, laid-back, and excited to make some new connections.

If you're also looking to meet new people and build some friendships, please feel free to comment below or send us a DM! It would be great to hear from you.

Looking forward to hopefully meeting some of you!",0,1751648466.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,0.5,False

My first gf cheated on me with her childhood sexual abbusers so I have a very hard trigger to cheating or the idea of it  

Alrighty, gonna go over my last couple years of my life and look for insight on what to do or how to navigate my feelings without gas lighting myself into thinking being treated like this is okay because I was unemployed 

I met my gf around the end of 2023. Things were great we hit it off so well it felt like I met my soul mate. I’m very anxious and not a very social person at all. And every date I had before the one with her I felt uncomfortable and I never thought about a 2nd date. Not the case with my gf I was head over heels. 

A month later I ended up slipping a disk in my back, I started doing physio therapy for 6 months with wcb, after that I was deemed unfit to return to my old job in plumbing because of my back getting better in that time. So we transitioned to physio 2x a week and started doing job searching with wcb. 

During this time in our relationship it would have been around June/ July. My girlfriend would invite me over to her place every single night, her place being halfway to my physio and me being over the moon for her of course I went went called. It definitely turned into me living with her before we knew it. But I was not on a lease or contributing at this point as I did not have a job nor did I think about the idea that I was kinda moving in with her. More and more of my clothes and personal items would come. House sit while she’s w her mom driving to another province. 

This is where it gets kinda shitty. 

My gf at the time told me from the start that her parents have been paying her rent for her to go to school. Which I thought was cool and wild but she wasn’t in school or ever enlisted. For 5 years… I also found out later that they were paying for her rent because she had pretty bad bi polar or something along those lines ( very big mood swings and a little crazy when she snaps) her parents wanted to keep the peace apparently and paying for her rent was easier then helping there daughter 

Around this point her friend and parents were a little upset that she was dating someone without a job and felt like I was free loading and a leach. And that’s where we started to argue about money and roles and me not having a job. And it’s been kinda down hill since then. Around the time I was done my 6 month physio with wcb. I did start to buy groceries. I was the only one cleaning, cooking, doing dishes, taking care of her cat. I was kinda a stay at home husband in between physio appointments. 

This turned into resentment and fights and me not doing enough and her hating me for it. I don’t know if this matters but every women in her life is heavily financially taken care of by there male partner. None of her sisters grandmas or her mom work since they were In there 20s. Her best friend as well. It got to the point where her entire family would ignore me, would ignore any attempt at conversation ignore simple hellos. Talk to me in the 3rd person “ can you let you bf know “ while I’m standing right next to both of them. Or her friend and bf asking me “oh how’s work going did you work today?” Knowing that I lost my job, my back is not as strong as it was. And I am trying to change Carrers to something that is suited for my back. 

6 months goes by. We’re into 2024 Januaryfebuarry, I’m still heavily in love and obsessed with this woman despite the arguments and bullying about not having a job or being able to contribute. 

The less agreement is coming up and my gf and her mom talked about it and they were going to rent the appartment for another year. A week goes by and her parents wanted to meet with her about the lease. And told her that they weren’t going to pay for it anymore with her dad coming home from work. And that she would need to move home. My gf was a wreck completely devastated. She liked the life and small home that we made at the appartment. She didn’t like the idea of moving home to somewhere she isn’t wanted or welcomed knowing they paid her rent to get her out of the house for them more than to help her. They started arguing a lot and ended up going to family therapy.

For some reason that I still don’t know why. In the middle of the week. After work. After doing family therapy for weeks after knowing you’re losing your home. She reached out to her ex from when she was 18/19 just to catch up? I’ll never know what they talked about. She came upstairs from a phone call she said she had with her friend. She was being weird about it and her friend goes to bed early at all the time so I asked to see the call log of over an hour and that’s when she broke down crying saying I fucked up. Tried telling me bits and pieces of it. Called the guy and he tried telling me that it was just catching up. He has no interest in my gf. He is 4 hours away from blah blah blah. I left raging. Went back for some reason to get reassurance to find out she called him back crying because she felt bad and thought that she lost me forever. I lost it even more and had a mini panic attack I’m not sure what to call it. My heart was going 100mph couldn’t breathe shaking like a tree. I feel like I blacked out because I don’t remember much after that. We fought argued I called her names was probably pretty mean. The only 3 excuses I got from it were, the memories of dates they went on was nice and she tried to blame my effort and lack of date. She was lonely with her best friend constantly talking shit she doesn’t have anyone else in her life she can talk to. Other than her one friend and her mom. And the 3rd being that she was acting out because she was losing her home and I didn’t have a job to help out and she felt like she was drowning and wanted advice and to talk about it. I was blamed for not making her feel special enough. Taking or planning dates. Being romantic. Not buying her gifts or not having the ability to do these things because I don’t have a job. And I fell for it I apologized my ass off. Said it would change. Made her a jar of date coupons that was Colour coded for budget. I did think the whole time the me taking care of her was my little version of a date. Going to get groceries was a date. Going to the farmers market or staying up late laughing watching tv. Cooking for her while she sits plays video games and talks to me. All of that shit I was in love I had huge heart eyes. I don’t need a restaurant or an expensive activity all the time when I get more enjoyment out of those little things at home. I don’t know if i genuinely am appreciating the little things or if i took it for granted and should have done more. 

After this i became the problem. I couldn’t let it go. I would bring it up all the time. It would keep me up at night. Trying to find the guy online or find anything about it that would explain why I wasn’t good enough to be loyal too. I would pick fights. Look into shit like a detective and make something out of nothing. Take things out of context. 

Now we both feel wronged. She’s dating a guy with no job or no ambition to go out and get one. And I am trying to build a life and give love to someone that has been hateful and emotionally cheated on me. Life goes on and come summer we move out. The plan to stay at my parents place as they had an entire mother in law suite that wasn’t in use. That was the plan until we had the apartment cleared out and all her stuff was packed up. Then she informs me that she will not be moving with me but going home. And that we aren’t going to be seeing much of each other anymore because her family’s opinion on me. 

Sleeping alone became incredibly hard while we were dating. Falling asleep on the couch when we’d argue cause I’m locked out or told to stay away was something that I couldn’t stand. I’m very co dependent person and I believe that my gf is as well. From when I stayed the first night I don’t think we spent more than one day apart from each other at a time. And as the relationship went on that habit and routine of sleeping next to someone was built. And when we were talking  about moving that was one of the biggest things for me that I was worried about and moving in w me and my family was all good untill that point. 

I started having a mental collapse, the girl that I love with everything dosent want anything to do with me. She wants this other guy. She dosent wanna live with me. She dosent wanna try. She wants to change her mind last minute. I even saw a text she sent her friend saying “ idk what to do I need help moving but feel like im stuck “ I was devastated and couldn’t stop crying and being depressed for 2 months. 

I’ll give her credit she was there almost every day despite saying she wasn’t going to be or I was with her. Her family chilled out a bit and would let me into there house. Eventually after 6 month would let me stay a night out of the month. At my family house she was open arms welcomed into the home so we eventually just spent more time at my house. 

During this time, our sex life dropped. Which I get cause we’re living at home with our parents. But I’m talking 0 attempt. 0 initiation. When we would have the house to ourselves she wouldn’t be interested. Would tell me that she is unattracted to me because I have no job. If she were to get pregnant her baby daddy would be a bum. She is so checked out if she tries to that she grosses herself out by think about dumb shit or other people. This went on from last summer untill now. Our sex life went from me begging her to stop and give me a chance to breathe to me begging and being told no I am using pussy as a motivation tool. 

Life goes on from that and come November. A different ex reaches out to her randomly while she’s at work. She answers the call cause she dosent know who it is. They talked for a bit and at the end of the conversation she did say that she had a bf and was in a relationship and shouldn’t be talking to exes. Said goodbye and blocked. However she did save a Snapchat video of her talking to the camera that she sent to her best friend. Saying she answered a call. Talked for a little bit. Realized it was wrong. Then started bawling her eyes out that she broke up with that kid when they were 18 cause he didn’t have a job and she thought he was a loser and she thought she could get a doctor or a lawyer or something like that. And know she’s 23 dating another boy who dosent have a job. While she broke up with this sweetest boy in highschool. More so attacking herself kinda I guess for being “silly”? But me watching and hearing those words over and over are etched into my brain. Apparently it’s my fault and that I should have went looking. It was the first video/ picture that came up when your in the camera app not even photos. The little preview box in the bottom corner. I seen a video of my beautiful gf recording herself and no shit I wanted to see her. But wasn’t expecting to be fucking tanked like that. 

Life goes on a couple months. I am back to work at this point. Making money getting my car and phone and my life back on track. And again I find something on her phone. She searched from the main search bar on the iPhone “why do I feel giddy for someone that isn’t my boyfriend” and here we are again. Apparently some guy comes into her work and there’s something about him that gives her butterflies that she can’t control and wanted to look into it by googling it. I find it stupid and I don’t believe that it was innocent was it was made to be. And the fact that this is happening at work and there’s nothing I can do. AND having sex denied and that type of affection denied while someone else is getting woed. It fucked me up.

Life goes on 6 months. By grandfather is selling his house and offers me to buy it at a discounted price. It was an offer that was too good to pass up so I acted on it.

Breakfast was pretty basic. Oatmeal, sliced strawberries that the camera missed, decaf coffee, prune juice and a soy milk that I divided between the oatmeal and coffee. I'd give it a solid 8 out of 10. Nothing spectacular,  but good, solid and filling. 

Lunch I got a little more adventurous. I had what they call the Northwest Bounty. Mixed greens, dried cherries, tomatoes and chopped hazelnuts with a house made berry vinaigrette.  I added an optional protein, tofu. The tofu wasn't seasoned at all, so next time I'll probably do either the salmon or chicken as a protein. Had cantaloupe as a side and peppermint tea. This was an absolute winner and I'll probably have it again soon, but with a different protein.  Definitely a 9.5/10

Dinner was a disappointment.  It tasted good as far as seasonings go, but an enchiladas with no cheese is pretty darn dry. I had the vegetable  crudites with fat free ranch as my side, which was fine. Overall,  I'd put dinner at a 5/10.

My sodium is officially low as of this morning.  Apparently they probably won't change my dietary orders, but add sodium to my pills regimen.

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a very poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8. I really mean it, too. You will only end up wasting your time, should you message me from a smut account.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

This also means that if you have a highly fleshed out world and/or story idea of your own, I will not be very interested. Still, I wish you the best of luck with it!

I have mentioned that what I want to write is post-industrial fantasy. Still, I should let you know that my brand of modern (or urban) fantasy is still closer to medieval fantasy classics like Lord of the Rings, rather than your average urban fantasy YA as I still make liberal use of many tropes, cliches and storytelling tropes present in the former!

How advanced should our setting be? Let's discuss that together! So long the world has at least reached the early industrial revolution, and so long it hasn't achieved quick, and convenient interstellar travel! I am open to anything in-between!

Oh, and I love a strong element of action so it is best that you enjoy writing out action scenes, and feel at least somewhat comfortable AND confident while writing them. I am also not the right partner for you, if you care much for realism in the aspect. The action I write *would* be pretty grounded compared to, say, Dragon Ball Z, but by objective standards... not very. Do expect anime/action movie sort of BS while coming in!

Oh, and I may want to spell it out as it has been an issue before: I am really not interested in primarily character-driven stories. Characters give life to the story, but I *need* a central, larger-than-life conflict to move the story along, and I do prefer for there to be very high stakes. It's not everyone's yum, but it is my yum, so just take that in mind!

Now, let us get onto...!

\----✂︎-- Writing! --✂︎----

Ah, writing – that is, the bread and butter of this hobby.

I have already talked briefly about it in the 'about me' section, but let me elaborate a bit more. As I said, my replies typically range between 300-600 words, with my larger responses reaching up to 1000 words and sometimes even more, and no, I couldn't tell you how much is that in paragraphs. Still, I don't believe in quotas, nor do I believe in padding the replies to fit said quotas and my approach to the beautiful, flowery kind of language is that it is like salt when used in cooking. Amazing when you use it in moderation, and not-so-amazing when you just dump a whole kilogram into the pot.

Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I require the same of my writing partners.

Still, while I do agree some degree of flexibility is required, this only goes so far with me. I generally prefer replies do not get much smaller than 150 words at the least, and no matter the situation, I will not accept a response that is only a couple sentences, or a one-liner.

I am happy to exchange writing samples in private messages, but that is entirely up to you. I don't require them myself and it's rare that I ever ask if not asked first.

\----✂︎-- The Characters! --✂︎----

So, the most important thing is that I create and tailor all my characters from scratch for every single story and I prefer to write with those who share a similar approach.

That also means that what sort of lead character I will come up is anyone's guess! That said, a couple key elements are almost certain to be the case. One, she is going to be a woman. Second, she will likely be in the age range from between late 20s to late 30s, and third, she will likely be a skilled combatant of some sorts, and fourth, she is going to skew onto the heroic side even if she starts out more morally gray... and all four points are what I require of your characters, as well. *Maybe* except for the age part, as young adult MCs aren't necessarily a deal-breaker (so long they are at least 21), but they aren't my preference and I cannot promise that I can be convinced to go down that road.

And, yes, the fourth point is unfortunately a hard requirement. While I love morally gray or amoral characters that stay that way through the story, I have to say that, unfortunately, I do not enjoy them as lead characters specifically.

Overall though, it is a requirement that you feel comfortable writing any characters that may vary by gender, age\*, personality, social background, romantic orientation, as well as moral alignment. Is it a tall order? Perhaps! But, I do offer the same on my end! I also simply love the process of character creation, and I seek those matching my energy!

\*That said, all major characters ought to be at least 21 years old of age.

I should also say a word or two about romance, as that makes or breaks the hobby for many people if not most of them. I love to write it, I love to have it, and I probably wouldn't enjoy a fully platonic roleplay, ***but*** I also do not want it as the centerpiece of the story. It can be important (and it should be, if our main characters are involved together) and it can take a lot of page time, but it cannot be the main plot and it shouldn't be the only thing you care for about in the story, either.

I also do prefer slow-burn, especially as far as the leading duo is concerned. Now, I will not *force* it if it doesn't make sense or requires active meta-sabogating, but I will naturally lean into it, so please be aware!

I also have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, *but* I also prefer partners able and willing to also write FxM/MxF and MxM ships for the other characters. Although, the MxM isn't a deal-breaker if you'd rather not write that or do not feel confident with it.

\----✂︎-- My writing dislikes and what I prefer to avoid! --✂︎----

Okay, so this is going to be a more cynical section.

Still, as a fair amount of my dislikes happen to be staples on the roleplaying scene, I prefer to get them out of the way as to help some of you from wasting your time. So, the things that I prefer to avoid in my stories are:

Fandoms, pre-industrial fantasy settings, sanitized immoral groups, fluff/grimdark extremes, slice-of-life (as a genre), vampire/werewolf stories, arranged marriage, enemies-to-lovers, the Masquerade (when the existence of magic is a secret), magic being banned setting-wide, stories with no true heroes nor villains, police/military settings (as the primary background), school settings, stories taking place in a single location, settings based off the real world (e.x. HP, Marvel, PJO), love at the first sight, large age gaps involving young adults, shock content for its own sake,

... and that is it! Probably.

In truth, there are very few storytelling tropes and conventions I would never use, so I am more than happy to elaborate on any of this! For example, the reason I dislike 'enemies to lovers' is because this either necessitates for romance to be the centerpiece of the story, or for the 'to lovers' part to happen very quickly. But, should it happen naturally between side characters, I will probably love it and eat it all up! *Still*, I wouldn't lead with any of the tropes mentioned above when messaging me, regardless, as I either dislike them, am very particular about them or may simply not be in the mood for some of them at the moment.

As for what I actually enjoy, my advert thus far has hopefully given you at least a rough idea, and I would be unfortunately beside myself to make an organized list of what I want and do enjoy. Especially since I want each story to be unique!

(That said, I would love to write with a fellow Final Fantasy fan!)

Hopefully this section hasn't discouraged you, and if it has, then I'm glad it at least saved you some time!

\----✂︎-- Fin! --✂︎----

So, that pretty much does it!

Anyway, when you choose to message me, I would like to know: how may I call you, what is your age, your pronouns, the time-zone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable enough to share!), any potential story triggers and, most important. some starting pitch for a story! Now, to be clear, I don't expect for you to come at me with anything detailed! Especially not when this advert provides no concrete ideas in and of itself. All I really want is just a starting point for the two of us to gauge our compatibility.

If I managed to pique your interest, then I would love to have your message! Otherwise, I hope you have a great day, or night!

Hey-ho, hee-ho!

Bonus brownie points, should you know where that's from!

As a little preamble of sorts, and I guess you could say a warning, let me state the obvious: this advert is *long* and yes, it *could* be much, much shorter. However, the reason it *is* so long is because a lot of the things that I talk about here are matters concerning compatibility. Meaning, whether there even *is* a point to us taking this into the DMs. So! Let me ask you this: would you rather waste fifteen minutes reading this, or an entire week worth of planning? I leave the choice up to you!

In any case, if I didn't scare you off, you may as well get yourself a cup of tea, or coffee, and get comfortable!

Now, let's carry on, shall we?

\----✂︎-- Basic Introductions and Expectations! --✂︎----

So, I am a 24 year old female roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands also known as Eastern Europe! To be more specific, I come from Poland and this puts me in the CEST time zone. I have been engaged in this hobby for pretty much half my life at this point, and while there's no such thing as perfect, I consider myself to be at least decent! Other than writing, I also love tea, reading, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy fiction of all sorts, as well as anything that's got fur and walks on four legs!

Oh, and I also happen to be a transgender woman. If you've got an issue with that, do me a kindness, and do not message me!

Now, let me get some things out of the way, first:

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older; this has got nothing to do with writing ability, and everything with my personal comfort. So, I will not make any exceptions. At the same time, I prefer to write with people close to my age, so my upper limit is around 35 years old.
2. At the moment, I prefer not to write with men. Sorry!
3. As of currently, I only write on Discord and nowhere else.
4. I require the reply rate of **at least** once per day, and I also highly prefer that multiple replies a day are possible at least every now and then. But, **no**, by no means do I require that every single day, and naturally, real-life always comes first.
5. I am advanced literate; I will elaborate on this more further into the advert, but my replies typically take between 300-600 words and may even reach 1000 words and I am looking for people on a similar level.
6. Strong OOC contact is required; half of the fun in this hobby comes to me from the OOC fangirling and brainstorming that surrounds it, and yes: I do prefer to befriend my writing partners. While that should come about naturally, I will already tell you that we will not be a good fit if you are opposed to that.
7. I am against the use of face-claims of any kind, and it's a deal-breaker, even if it's to be a one-sided arrangement.
8. NFSW the way it is usually understood is unlikely; I highly prefer fade-to-black. Should you message me from an account with *any* amount of ERPer content, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Please note that while I am more than happy to elaborate on any of these, none of them really are up to discussion, debate or meaningful compromise. You will particularly make a very poor first impression, should you lead with point no. 8. I really mean it, too. You will only end up wasting your time, should you message me from a smut account.

Another thing that's important is schedule compatibility. To put it in a way that's short and sweet: if you are only going to be available prior to 12 PM my time, or after 10 PM my time, this is not going to work. As the planning stage tends to take a while with me even at the best of times, this is not negotiable. So, please take that in mind before you decide to message me.

I would also appreciate if you had a good amount of free time on weekends; I can usually do some back-and-forth during the week, but it's on the weekends that I can promise the most of my undivided attention.

Thaaaat... should be it! Now, let us carry on!

\----✂︎-- What do I want to write! --✂︎----

So, what is it that I want to write?

Adventure! A(n epic) fantasy tale that will be equally rife with the power of love and friendship, but also drama and angst! What I want to write is a plot-driven piece of fiction with an expansive ensemble cast of diverse and vibrant characters with a dense plot-line, rich lore and tons of world-building! The kind of story that I wish to write would be something akin to a DnD adventure, with a band of heroes traveling from town to town, braving perilous wilderness, conquering ancient dungeons, meeting new friends and allies and defeating fearsome foes, while a powerful evil looms behind the horizon! With the 'twist', of course, that all this should happen within a world that has at least reached the steam engine!

Or, at least, that's the general gist. The details are for us to work out together!

What is also important is that, as a collaborative writer, I wish to build everything in our little story from the ground-up... except for monsters, creatures and other sorts of beasts. In this case, I am no stranger to shamelessly stealing preexisting concepts! It is not a perfect approach, but I don't believe in perfect, and I would love to write with someone interested in the same!

I will try to describe things that happened very quickly as there were so many weird things going on. Everything started when we were visiting my family in Europe. We received a call from our friends who were watching our house. They said we had a fire. Apparently, a broom that was against a wall fell onto a plug-in scent diffuser. It caused the liquid from it to spill into the baseboard heater. Then we were dealing with insurance, and that was just a nightmare. Everything that could go wrong definitely went wrong. We were staying in a rental for a bit. Our friend who was selling her house said that we can stay there as her house was for sale for over a year, and they didn't even get one offer yet. Well... 3 weeks after we had moved in, someone viewed the house, and bought it. In the meantime, my husband had multiple small accidents. Chipped his elbow bone in jujitsu. Had a coffee mug fell onto his finger from a cupboard, and needed stitches, got a scratch on his leg that got infected, had a glass doorknob shutter in his hand when he was opening the door and needed more stitches. Then we almost had a car accident when we hit black ice on a highway. Then we had more car problems. When we finally moved back into the house, we had a leak from a bathroom pipe. And just yesterday we had something smash our window. No idea what or who did that but it is broken. Constantly something happens and we are just really exhausted. We tried cleansing the house with sage, and incense sticks. We bought crystals, and charge them at every full moon. We sleep right next to them. 

What else can we do? And why is it happening to us?

we all kinda just got used to that routine you know we read his note he gives us the biggest smile and goes on his way i always thought it was cool that he still came every day even tho it probably took extra effort for him

but then my coworker she’s kinda quiet type super shy she started taking sign language classes on her own like nobody asked her she just decided she wanted to make him feel more included she didn’t even tell anyone she was doing it she would just sit in the break room on her phone practicing or watch videos during lunch

one day i noticed her practicing in the mirror mouthing out words and doing hand signs i thought she was just being goofy or practicing a dance at first but turns out she was learning so she could actually greet him properly instead of just nodding or awkwardly waving the paper around

last week she finally decided to try she signed good morning to him and when i tell yall the look on his face bro it was pure joy he literally lit up like a christmas tree he started signing back super fast and she was trying her best to keep up she kept laughing and messing up but he was so patient with her

they must’ve stood there for like a good 5 mins just chatting in sign i don’t even know what they were saying but it looked like they were having the best convo ever she looked so proud of herself too and i swear we all just stood there watching with stupid grins on our faces

he ended up giving her this lil handwritten thank you note later that said something like thank you for learning to talk to me it means a lot and she actually teared up and hugged it like it was a golden ticket she taped it on her locker too now every morning they have these mini convos in sign and he’s started teaching her new words too sometimes they even joke around and she tries to sign silly stuff and he corrects her

now the rest of us are all inspired and we started picking up random signs too like good morning thank you have a nice day we still mess up a lot but he always laughs and helps us fix it it turned into this wholesome thing where the whole team is lowkey learning bits of sign language just to make him feel welcome

honestly seeing her effort made me realize how big of a difference small actions can make like she didn’t have to do any of that she just genuinely cared enough to make that connection and now it’s become the most heartwarming part of our mornings

some customers even started noticing and complimenting her and he brings his friends sometimes now and they all sign together and it’s just the cutest thing ever fr it gives me hope for humanity ngl

idk man it just hits different when you see ppl go out of their way to make someone else feel seen and heard we need more ppl like her fr ",187,1751647650.0,stories,8,0.99,False

As someone who depends heavily on their morning coffee, I dug deep into every feature, nuance, and quirk this gadget offers. While it delivers a decent brew for its price point, there are certainly aspects that could use some refining. Let me break it down for you.

**DESIGN AND FUNCTIONALITY**  
The compact design of this coffee maker makes it a winner for anyone short on counter space. Its dimensions (5.98""D x 9.44""W x 14.17""H) allow it to slot seamlessly into small kitchens, office break rooms, or even a cozy dorm. The black and stainless steel finish is modern, subtle, and blends with almost any kitchen decor. Its space-saving nature doesn’t translate to a compromise in performance—functionality seems to have been a key priority for its designers.  

The first thing I noticed was the intuitive layout of the buttons. It’s straightforward and uncomplicated, which suits tech-averse users like some of my older relatives. The removable drip tray also gave the appliance versatility, as I could slide my taller travel mug under the spout without any spills.  

[Check Amazon Basics AB-1178B price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08ntpspnm/)  

**BREWING OPTIONS AND PERFORMANCE**  
This coffee maker is advertised as dual-functional, and I was excited to test its versatility. It works with both K-Cup capsules and fresh coffee grounds. Switching between the two options was seamless—one minute, I was brewing a classic breakfast blend using a K-Cup; the next, I had freshly ground beans brewed to perfection. The device didn’t show any signs of struggle with either brewing method.  

I appreciated its ability to brew directly into a range of cup sizes, from a modest 6-ounce coffee lover’s cup to a 14-ounce travel mug. However, the taste leaned slightly better with fresh grounds, in my opinion. The temperature of the resulting brew was spot-on—piping hot but not scalding. For anyone in a rush, the brewing process is impressively efficient; the machine didn't keep me waiting long for my caffeine fix.  

**FEATURES THAT STAND OUT**  
A major highlight of this appliance is its 24-ounce refillable water reservoir. Unlike smaller units that require constant refilling, this coffee maker can handle multiple servings before needing a top-up. For someone sharing the device with others (like in a shared workspace or family home), this is a game-changer.  

The auto-shutoff feature deserves a mention too. This function gives peace of mind for those days when you’re rushing—once brewing is complete, it powers down automatically. That small detail can make a big difference in energy savings and safety.  

**ADVANTAGES**  
- Dual brewing system accommodates K-Cups and fresh grounds.  
- Compact, lightweight design fits beautifully into small spaces.  
- Convenient auto-shutoff enhances safety and energy efficiency.  

**DRAWBACKS**  
- The plastic components, though functional, feel somewhat flimsy.  
- While the coffee temperature is suitable, some users may find it isn’t quite as hot as premium machines.  
- There’s no advanced customization for brew strength, which might deter true coffee connoisseurs.  

**BUILD AND DURABILITY**  
At just 4.63 pounds, this coffee maker is easily movable, but its build leans toward the lightweight side, making it feel less robust than high-end coffee makers. While this doesn’t impact its brewing capability, it’s something to note if build quality is a top priority for you.  

Longevity often correlates with regular maintenance in machines like these. Thankfully, the removable drip tray and water reservoir make cleanup a breeze. I found it extremely easy to keep the unit clean. My only gripe here would be the limited range of color options—it’s practical, but some added aesthetic variety would have been a plus.  

**INDUSTRY COMPETITORS**  
How does the Amazon Basics AB-1178B measure up to its rivals? Compared to the Keurig K-Mini, they share similarities in size and functionality. However, the Keurig offers a slight edge in terms of design polish and advanced temperature control. On the other hand, the Amazon machine is far more wallet-friendly, which makes it alluring for budget-conscious buyers.  

Another competitor worth noting is the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew Single Serve. While the Hamilton has a similar dual brewing system, its larger footprint makes it less appealing for those with limited space. The Amazon coffee maker strikes a fine balance between affordability, functionality, and form.  

**PRICE PERFORMANCE**  
You’d expect to pay a steep price for a machine that handles dual brewing options, but this single-serve coffee maker balances features and affordability remarkably well. It feels suitable for personal use, dorms, small offices, or anyone not looking to shell out premium dollars for their daily caffeine fix. It’s not loaded with bells and whistles, but the features it does include are well-executed.

1lrnbzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1lrnbzm/ready_bat_review_of_manual_not_included/,Ready Bat Review of “Manual Not Included” - Introduction & Chapter 1: Not a Cinderella Story,"Hola pepinos! After recapping *The Baldwins* I needed a break and probably a little therapy too, but I made do with a recapping break. Of course, Hillary chose that post show moment to ramp up the thirsty lunacy. You all have been phenomenal at documenting her frenetic posts – Dancing! Acting! Teeny leg lifts in teeny bathing suits! Clapping back! – so I feel like I haven’t missed a thing. Pepinos who answered the little poll I did indicted they would like recaps, so I’ll recap her July social media at the beginning of August. Another group said they wanted a chapter-by-chapter book review, so this is the first installment. Disclaimer: I’m reading a chapter at a time (not the whole book) and then quickly writing the review because they seem like pretty disjointed chapters. The big picture analysis will come at the end!  

Only four people wanted a review of Carmen’s book so we will all be spared a deep dive into how her publisher claims you can *“mix your own natural skincare products that’ll have your enemies wondering about your glow”* or *“stay connected without losing your energy or falling into crusty comparison traps.”* I wish Carmen was still happily slathering PeePaw's face with leftover tofu or whatever but, alas, she drew the short stick in the mami lottery, so she’ll probably be out promoting her book this summer. In the meantime, may the force be with us as we read Hillary’s multifluid ruminations. Hopefully she didn’t dislocate her wrist in her quest to make sure we knew she wrote a book as insubstantial as she is.

[That trashcan was like, I'm literally right here. Chuck it in and be done. ](https://preview.redd.it/aae6xrvouvaf1.png?width=280&format=png&auto=webp&s=ecce9a33747a81998725164e10fd4295a6451935)

**Introduction**

* My 11- and 10-year-olds routinely write introductions longer than this paltry intro, but to be fair, if it was long I’d be salty, too! So, let’s give Hilz the benefit of the doubt and say these three tiny paragraphs are simply little verbal tapas to whet our appetite for the literary feast ahead. However, since this is Hillary Lynn Hayward-Thomas Baldwin we’re dealing with, this intro is a cold tortilla with a whisper of organic hummus slapped on it, as bland as the Bostonian Bahbie herself. As far as first lines of a self-help vanity project go, this is meh at best: ***“Looking back on my life over the past fifteen years or so, I realized that I often felt obligated to defend or explain things about myself: Why did I marry somebody so much older? Why was I making a certain parenting choice? Why did I have so many children? I was constantly on edge, trying to prove that I wasn’t a gold digger, out of touch, or fake—nor was I practicing any nefarious witchery. Through many tears, insight from others, hard work and growth, I have learned that none of those outside opinions had anything to do with me.”***
* I have heard Hillary called an out of touch fake gold digger, but who in the world accused Hillary of…practicing witchcraft? This ninny. She continues: ***“This book is not about me preaching or telling anyone what to do. Far from it. It’s about admitting that this woman-ing and mothering and partnering and life-ing thing is hard.”***
* You know what’s hard? Reading words like “woman-ing.” I hope the editor that worked on this drivel never knows peace.
* She says she has no answers but lots of stories about herself and cautions us to ***“take it for what you will”*** – let’s go through the chapters and assess how we all take Hillary’s musings, shall we?

**Chapter 1:** ***Not a Cinderella Story***

* Hillary likes to cover all bases, so she “writes” (dictates for the ghost writer to sort out) sentences like this: “***I believe that some parts of relationships are about growing and equal parts are about letting go.”*** Jesus by the river, how are we getting through a whole book of *apples are good, but also oranges as well*?
* She explains the chapter title thusly: “***We have been riddled with fairy tales our whole lives, and when we are familiar with someone, often we cannot help but see their love interest through this lens. I love a fairy tale, but I hate the idea that Alec somehow chose me like Prince Charming chose Cinderella. I was a whole person before I met him, with autonomy, and I lived happily and was constantly evolving.”***
* Maybe Hillary was “riddled” with fairy tales growing up in Beacon Hill, but most folks were steeped in them (positive connotation) or maybe indoctrinated by them (negative connotation). Words matter, Hilly Vanilli.
* In this chapter she powers through the eight years between 2012 – 2020 at breakneck speed. In *“telling her story”* and *“finding her voice”* she makes significant omissions that left me baffled - but when has any Híláríá-produced narrative made sense? These are all choices:
   * Omitted: the entirety of The Pure Food and Wine saga. In chapter one, the love story for the ages (heh) begins with the old chestnut about Alec shaking her hand after every date they had for six weeks – nothing about their meet cute when Hillary supposedly bleated out to the universe that she was ready for love and then Alec Baldwin being smitten by her and supposedly saying *“I must know you.”* Straight to their quickie courtship we go.
   * Included: the story of Alec proposing in Montauk because ***“my family lives in Spain, so this was Alec’s romantic idea: it was the closest he could get to my family while he was asking me to marry him.”*** She also shares that the whole thing was awkward because Alec was directing her as he tried to craft a romantic scenario and she was cold and it’s pretty much the least sentimental or romantic proposal ever.
   * Omitted: Any description of their wedding at St. Patrick’s Old Cathedral where she carried a Spanish fan and [told People magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/10mofkc/six_crazy_hilaria_baldwin_moments_you_didnt_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) that she liked her mantilla style veil (made in the US by bridal designer Amsale) because *“the veil is a traditional Spanish veil so I like that it brought in a bit of my culture”* whilst Tweeting (as one did back then) *“Being a bride is stressful…. Ayyyyyyy”* (as a non-Spanish white lady should never say or Tweet).  
   * Included: the story of Alec sending her to Cartier with her “girlfriends” (where are all these mysterious women?) to select her own engagement ring: “***My mom doesn’t have an engagement ring, and it wasn’t something I felt strongly about. (Now we joke about this because I’ve changed my ring twice. Once I had a taste, I quickly got on the ring train!) Alec sent me to Cartier to pick a ring out. In typical me fashion, I showed up with two girlfriends and we said all the embarrassing and cringey things that one should never say in Cartier.”*** What could they have said? She proceeds to note that the saleslady, Saleah, basically bullied her into choosing a ring she didn’t like but now they’re great friends! No wonder her “girlfriends” fell off the face of the earth if she tells bullshit passive aggressive stories like this about them.

   * Included: this picture credited to the owner of Madman Espresso where Hillary sports gnarly fake hair and a blanket and Alec pouts aggressively:

   * Included: a story of how Alec’s “stalker,” [Genevieve Sabourin](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/ryzmhf/a_mashmillion_of_words_about_the_genevive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), showed up at their Hampton’s house the night they got engaged and ruined the vibes: ""***I was so excited on the drive home, and when we got back, I immediately went upstairs to call my friends and family and send pictures of the ring. I headed into the bathroom to talk because Alec likes to keep the house cold and I like it hot, and the bathroom had its own thermostat, so I would crank it up and hang out in there. Alec stayed downstairs, and suddenly I heard him start screaming with total urgency and fear in his voice. “Get down on the ground: she’s here!” I’d never heard him sound like that before. I threw myself to the ground, heart pumping, so confused. Who was here? He yelled up again: “She’s at the door! I’m calling the police.” He was referring to the woman who had been stalking and harassing us. The police came, but she’d gotten away. They couldn’t find her. I don’t want to talk much about her here. She was and still is a very terrifying person to me. She intruded into our lives over and over, and for this she was eventually sent to Rikers Island. It was very scary and very sad.""*** I would argue that (allegedly) providing false testimony to imprison someone is very scary and very sad (again my 11- and 10-year-olds can brainstorm lists of adjectives that run circles around “scary” and “sad”).
* Random Inclusions:
   * 3 mentions of her mother, 2 of her brother, and 10 mentions of her “friends” who were apparently everywhere from packing up her things to move into Alec’s apartment, to choosing her engagement ring, to the labor and delivery room with Leo.
   * A long, detailed story of a newlywed Hillary cleaning out their Hamptons pantry which was stuffed with expired goods and Alec freaking out that she did it (with his permission). She feels this is a perfect illustration of how Alec’s OCD manifests. One might also say it is a perfect illustration of what happens when control issues meet disordered eating, but same same.
   * They eat out so much because Alec ***“doesn’t like the lingering smell of food.”*** Weird, I thought it was because he wanted dinner dates with his perpetual girlfriend, but you do you, Hilz!

**We Know, We Know, Ju Hab Seben Keeds**

Hillary zooms straight from their early days of wedded bliss as they cleaned out pantries and clashed over pretty much everything and into her baby era. Here’s how she describes (some) pregnancies:

* Carmen’s birth through age one = 1 page
   * ***“When I was first pregnant with our oldest daughter, Carmen, Alec and I had been together for nearly two years. I attempted to get Alec to come to every single ob-gyn appointment, scan, and blood test. But it just wasn’t something he was comfortable with. We would bicker and fight and be late to appointments, and eventually it became more about us fighting and less about the excitement of having a baby.”***
   * Hillary details what time she went into labor (3:30 am), how she thoughtfully and selflessly hesitated to call her OB/GYN at that hour, how Alec insisted on walking the dogs before leaving for the hospital, how she tested her head and held onto the doorman’s desk through her contractions, and how Alec finally got over himself and was ***“present”*** as she pushed and how he cut the umbilical cord.
   * Back to the star of the show – Hilz describes being heavily pregnant with Rafa, and being alone with Carmen and having to take the dogs out for a walk (I suppose their giant balcony was not set up with fake grass for pet pee until years later): “***Once, very early in the morning, the dogs woke me up, wanting to go out. I put Carmen in the baby carrier over my pregnant belly, took a leash in each hand, and walked the dogs through a blanket of snow that had covered the city streets overnight. I was careful to avoid places where the dogs could get salt on their paws. (We’d been struggling with getting the dogs to wear their booties, so instead I put a special balm on their paws to give them protection against the salt.) As I awkwardly walked in the thicker snow, I bent down, trying to balance my stomach and Carmen and keep hold of the dogs as I picked up their poop. It was quite a physical feat. And just at that moment, a man drove by and screamed that I was a monster because my dogs didn’t have boots on. That was it. I’d had enough and I broke. Achy, tired, defeated, and alone, I started to cry. Piece of shit. How dare you? Afterward, I knew it was silly to have gotten so emotional over a random guy yelling at me, but I was overwhelmed, and it was the last thing I needed to hear.”***
* Rafa’s birth = 1 page
   * Hillary details what time she went into labor (2:30 am), and what a piece of garbage Alec was to her as her labor progressed – constantly asking her whether he should cancel his stupid performance in a stupid play in the Hamptons. I can’t stand Hillary but that is pretty gross behavior on Alec’s part.
   * Her description of the ride to their ride to the hospital is revealing: “***Our driver took us; Alec’s assistant was with us too. As we were driving uptown in the rush-hour traffic, with all those bumps and stops, I moaned and breathed through the pain. Alec was taking calls and responding to emails. Now I know that it was his way of dealing with stress, but at the time it really pissed me off, and I didn’t hesitate to tell him so. Our driver and assistant spoke up: “Alec, this needs to wait.” It is fascinating watching people wired like him: they can have hearts of gold, but stressful situations bring out behaviors that can misrepresent them.”***  I’d say it represents him perfectly but I’m just a mean boolly.
   * She commits to the language of carrying and birthing Rafa herself:
      * ***When I got pregnant a year and change later with our son Rafa…***
      * ***I was due to give birth to Rafa in July…***
      * ***I went into labor at 2:30 a.m. on June 16, just shy of thirty-six weeks…***
      * ***We wanted to see if I could calm the contractions. So I returned home and went to bed, trying to rest on my sides…***
   * Ok, 27 pages in and I finally read something that made me smile. She’s talking about how the doctor and the nurses were working on Rafa bc the cord was wrapped around his neck, and she was terrified and then writes this: “***I got more and more upset and said to a nurse, “If you don’t wheel me over there, I am going to pull out my IVs and walk over there myself!” I have proudly told this story for years, and bless my friend who burst my bubble of feeling intimidating when he finally said to me, “Hilaria, you had an epidural, right?” “Of course,” I responded. He countered with: “How were you going to pull your IVs out and march over there, demanding to see Rafa? Like, you couldn’t feel your legs or walk…”***
   * RC interns take note – this is how you tell a self-deprecating, relatable story. It’s the first time I’ve come across Hilaria doing this well and I damn near have a PhD in the Baldwinian Fuckery program designed by [u/Funky\_MFer](https://www.reddit.com/user/Funky_MFer/), so maybe take note.
* Leo’s birth = 1 page (plus a picture)
   * No time of birth given, just a casual mention of having low amniotic fluid
   * Again, lots of language about birthing this kid herself:
      * ***My pregnancy with Leo was pretty uneventful…***
      * ***I was having a lot of contractions, as I was close to my due date…***
      * ***I decided that I wouldn’t tell Alec I was going to have the baby until I got organized and settled and definitely had my epidural!***
      * Hilz rambles on about making her peace with how different she and Alec are and recognizing her own value yada yada yada yada and not needing Alec to support her at doctor’s appointments or even as labor progressed.

[Why this one pic of this one kid's birth?](https://preview.redd.it/xtvizc5pxvaf1.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=75d83ef50cd754deca1bddb6b50d8b6e294f67ff)

* Romeo = nada/nothing/crickets
   * She goes straight from her story of feeling empowered by birthing Leo pretty much on her own and straight into Edu’s birth and the Big Grift Reveal. Ma’am, wut. You forgot a whole kid. Maybe his birth story pops up in other chapters? I’ll keep an eye out as I keep going.
* Edu = One sentence
   * ***""It was December of 2020, the middle of Covid, before vaccines had come out, and I’d just had my fifth child, Edu.""***
* Marilú = One sentence
   * ***Marilu was expected, via surrogate, in February.*** No accent mark on her name because who needs consistency?
* Ilaria = nada (but she doesn’t fit in the timeline of kids born 2013 – 2021, I guess)

**Heartless Trolls Attack Híláríá Because They Don’t Understand Multilingualism or Brain Function or ADHD or Dyslexia or Neurodivergence (aka Hillary Lynn is a White Girl Born and Raised in Boston Who Likes Spain and Got Busted for Pretending She Was Spanish)**

* Rewriting the narrative about Hillary pretending to be from Spain is why this ill-written pamphlet exists - let’s not pander to her ego and call it a book, it’s flimsy, y’all. Fortunately, *el pez por su boca muere*, a saying in Spanish that in this case means that Hillary’s own words when she was deep in the grift revealed the truth that she’s now desperately trying to attribute to her brain chemistry. She glibly and with her whole chest said she was a *“Spanish yoga teacher”* who came to this country when she was 19. She is a white woman born and educated in the US who was taught Spanish as a kid and vacationed in Spain during her childhood. This makes Spanish a language she speaks, it does not make her Spanish or entitle her to say she is bicultural.
* When the Leni Briscoe tweet went viral and it converged with the Amy Schumer kerfuffle, the world realized, hot damn, Alec Baldwin’s wife with the accent is actually not even a little bit Spanish. According to Hillary Lynn this is how it went down: ***“But we all remember what it was like back then \[during Covid lockdown\]. It was just hard. It was the holidays, and I couldn’t see my family because they were in a different country. I’d just had a baby but I had broken my ankle while running. I was trying my best to homeschool in a system where schools and teachers and parents and kids were all struggling.*** ***And then suddenly people were poking at me for how I sounded and how I code switched. It all got out of control. There was a coordinated mob after me at a time when people were at home, lonely, angry, and bored. Cancellation became the new gladiator sport.*** ***Especially against women. I have a strong feeling that one day our kids or kids’ kids will be learning about the level of evil toxicity spewed at one another during this time.”***
* Holy Bostonian delusion, Batman. She is legit trying to say people were upset because she was “code switching” (which she’s 100% not doing). She conveniently omits her own half-assed apology videos wherein she actually addressed the real issues and said verbatim (gracias u/GloomyAd594 for [this classic post](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaAlecBaldwin/comments/ziajqx/icymi_videos_wtranscript_of_hillarys_nonapology/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)):
   * Nervous AF Video # 1: *“Yes, I am a white girl. I am a white girl. \[Video cuts out here\] And let's be very clear that Europe, you know, has a lot of white people in them in there and my family is white. And you know, ethnically, I'm a mix of many, many, many things.”*
   * Mad AF Video #2: *“There's nothing wrong with me and and I'm not going to apologize for the amount of time that I've spent in two countries and I'm not going to apologize for the fact that I speak two languages, I'm not going to apologize for the fact that, you know, I have two versions of my name, which is the same name, and none of us are, it should have it be that complicated that it's the same name, just some letters different. And this is not somebody trying to pretend to be something else it's literally just, you have two cultures. \[Accent\] And that doesn't have you don't have to go into like deep family history of trying to figure it out. That's my life experience. And I don't have to apologize for my life experience”*
* But now it’s about brain function, gaissss. Hillary cites her IG “friend” (who I can’t find on IG but whatever) and ***“his thoughts when someone questions bilingualism.”*** I’ll spare you his thoughts but who the fuck is questioning bilingualism? Hillary goes on for 5 pages (the chapter is only 17 pages with huge margins and 6 pictures that take up space) making the shakiest straw man argument in the world. She claims:
   * ***“I have ADHD and dyslexia, and these greatly impact my speech, my reading, my listening, my focus, my memory, and my self-confidence.”***  A martyr.
   * **“Growing up being neurodivergent, I had to work harder in school than many of the people around me.”** A saint.
   * ***“Now I know that it’s ridiculous that anyone would feel outraged or amused because someone forgot a word. Can you be honest right now, reading this: Have you ever forgotten a word? But back then, I started to really unravel. I was confused. I felt lost. I missed my family. I couldn’t eat. I got very thin. I started to question my sanity. I started to question if I was a good person.”*** An idiot. No one cares that she pretended to forget a word – this issue is the CULTURAL APPROPRIATION.
   * ***“I have learned that it isn’t just malice and ignorance that led to the insanity I experienced; it really was about a woman and her voice. Taking her voice.”*** A fucking enchanted mermaid. In the past five years this loon has had not one but two failed podcasts, grown her IG account, started her own channel and a TikTok account, and had a book published by Gallery Books (for shame) yet she’s solemnly telling us she was robbed – robbed! – of her voice.
   * ***“I took speech therapy to enunciate better. The more I got treatment for the ADHD that I was trying to ignore, the better I got at separating the two languages and not getting as distracted. I tried to improve myself in all the ways the internet trolls had told me I was broken. And then I got to the point where I realized: This is not helping me. I am mixed-up but I am not bad or broken. And then Hilaria returned.”*** A poor listener – we said she was a grifter and a liar who knows exactly what she’s doing, not broken.
   * ***“On an academic level, I am proud of all I have learned about the human brain and language and belonging. Back then, instead of standing up for myself, I hung my head and apologized. But now I have compassion for myself because I didn’t know how to act any differently: it was all so confusing and unexpected. Now I choose not to be intimidated and not to feel like a victim. And I hope by speaking up and living this way, there can be better understanding of people who sound different. Shit was thrown at me, and it took me a while, after feeling wounded and broken, but I got back up again. With Alec by my side, I am determined to live as my multi-mix me.”*** Captain of the spaceship ‘Improbable’ – no one was/is mad that she’s bilingual. We’re mad she says shit like “multi-mix me” and that’s supposed to fix the fact that she is stacking lies on top of lies like breast-feeding baby on top of breast-feeding baby.
   * ***“Labels such as multicultural, multilingual, third-culture kids, culturally fluid, are attempts to capture what it is to belong and not to belong in a world that just wants to put everyone in one simple box. We often gravitate toward one another.”***  A grifter. She literally fits none of those descriptors. She is tenuously and performatively bilingual, full stop. GTFOH with the “we” – her paid Latino lackeys who fan the flames of her delusions should be ashamed of themselves.
   * ***“I’d sit on my bathroom floor, nursing my baby Edu at 3:00 a.m., and speak to my brother in Spain, and I’d cry to him, nauseous about it all. He’d try to lighten things up by saying, “Can we just stop for a second and talk about how nonsensical this is? You’re speaking to me in Spain, where I’ve lived for most of my life, in Spanish, about the validity of our connection to Spain. No one is really offended—it’s Covid, and they are home alone and bored, and there is so much misinformation.” I teach my kids Spanish, we eat certain Spanish foods that I grew up eating, and these are comforts to me. My brother raised his son in Spain, obviously immersed in Spanish culture and language, and made sure that my nephew spoke English and learned American culture too. Being this way is not taking anything from anyone. It’s just the way that we were raised.”***  An entitled brat who thinks eating magdalenas makes her special and can’t see that Jeremito’s kid is actually bicultural. Her brood just hates their Spanish immersion school their weird mom makes them attend.
* This abysmal first chapter ends on a weirdly ambiguous note: ***“Alec and I are in the best place we’ve ever been. The future is unknown, but right here and now we are a good team…*** ***Who knows what will come? Nothing is a forever guarantee, but now, every day, we laugh. We also drive each other crazy, but that’s part of the joy of life.”*** Um, does that sound like she’s hedging her bets?

**See You Next Time**

* Chapter two is entitled “Mom Boss” – say a little prayer as I prepare to read those 12 (?!?!) pages.

01.24.Unknown Year

	I don't remember a time before the blasts. I was only two when my father locked the whole family underground. 
  ""Father had spent months working on it."" My mother would tell me. ""He always knew the safest place was out here, away from the chaos of the cities."" She said,""Why should we waste money to be crammed in some tuna can next to a bunch of city slickers who wouldn't know the right way to turn a wrench, when we could build our own shelter. Stock our own supplies, afterall, we wouldn't need that much with just the three of us out here. So your father took it upon himself to fortify the old family root cellar. He studied filtration systems for the air and water. Your father used his connections as a mining engineer to invest in four local mines just to get better deals on material. I remember distinctly, him saying, the walls are a combination of steel, lead, concrete, and a lot of willpower. He insulated the shelter so much that we could barely feel the blasts. Your father was determined that we would survive. He dumped all of our savings into this bunker. He wanted to make sure you had a future.""
What a future it turned out to be...
	The way the story goes, a week or so after we came down here, my dad realised he forgot the bag of ammunition. He grabbed his mask, his coat, and his gun, leaving us with a few shells and nothing to fire them. From inspecting the shells I've found down here, I'd say it was a twenty gauge. He left to check the house, locking the door to the shelter behind him. The lock was of his own design, special, needs a key on both sides to open. Mother claims to have heard gunshots from the door not long after.... She thought ""He must have found the ammo! Yes! Yes he's shooting at bandits!"" Mother waited patiently by the door for Father to return, only leaving to check on me. After the third day, Mother finally gave up. She knew father wasn't coming back. Knew he was most likely dead, killed by the bandits he was fending off. Most of all she knew that without someone to let us out, we were trapped...  That was twenty three years ago.... 
	I don't have any memories of my father. He left us alone down here when I could barely speak. I only know what he looked like from an old photo, one mother has kept in a cigar box for all these years. I like to think he was a good man, afterall he provided us with this shelter. Not to mention he braved the fallout and died trying to protect us. Mother thinks of him as a hero. Part of me feels the same, but an equal part blames him for the life I've been forced to live.
	I'm grown now, still down here with my mom. Though over the past year or so her health has diminished rapidly. She says its radiation coming through the vents. I still feel fine though, so I'm not so sure.
	I've tried the door on many occasions throughout the years. When I was sixteen I was convinced dad was still alive out there. I was hell bent on finding him and reuniting the family. I tried and tried for hours on that door kicking and wailing on it. I even tried to pry the door open with a leftover steel pipe. It was no use. The door wouldn't budge. A few years later I tried again with similar results. All the while mom is telling me ""It's not safe out there. There's still too much radiation!"" She wasn't wrong, when I put the geiger counter near the seams of the door, it spiked. After awhile I stopped trying the door, I came to accept living in this hole in the ground, we were safe, we had clean food and water. Sure, all I have are my dad's old clothes to wear, and given the size, he was much larger than me. It's not so bad, I guess... We ARE still alive...

	01.26.Unknown Year

	We spend our days eating pre rationed meals and playing the same two board games dear old dad was nice enough to bring, Checkers and Connect Four. I think Dad had a thing for poker because each box has far too many pieces and a deck of cards with each. Although, even playing those games is difficult in the dim glow of a single filament light bulb. A light so far past its prime it flickers and dims every minute or so. I'd replace the bulb but I haven't been able to find it anymore. Guess dad didn't think of everything.
	The water and air purification are still running at 98%, according to the gauges dad installed on a maintenance panel. Fecal generators are still kicking too, one of dads ideas to cut costs. We burn our waste as fuel to keep everything running, mom says it was a genius idea, I say it stinks, literally. But, I guess it does keep the light on... somewhat. I hate refueling days though. Emptying the refuse bin from the toilet into the generator is quite a process. I have to say that two people's shit is a lot more than you'd think it'd be, and the smell. It was like rotten eggs and spoiled milk mixed in a hot pot. A smell so foul it makes my nose burn and my head all fuzzy. Just thinking about it ⁹makes me gag.
	All in all, things are, have been, and will be the same. Mother wants me to write our story. That way there is a chance our memory will live on. There's not much of a story when you've been trapped in a hole your whole life. The first few entries made me feel good. Even if they don't get found, I atleast enjoy focusing on something.  

01.29.Unknown Year

	Mother woke up vomiting today. It finally subsided after two hours. She's ice cold to the touch, but claims to be burning up. I went ahead and set up an IV with some nausea medicine for her. I offered her something for pain, but she refused. After the fit of vomiting and getting the IV set up. Mother just lied in bed, going in and out of consciousness.
	I have a basic understanding of the medicines we have down here. I won't lie though, I am worried about my mom. I've never seen her this week. It seemed to happen so fast, almost overnight. I know she's been getting worse, but I guess I was just in denial. Not letting myself see how frail she'd become. Just being blissfully unaware of her worsening condition. I see my mother now, lying there. Her paper thin skin, showing every blue and purple vein against her ghostly white figure. Subtle breathing letting me know she's still alive. I'm honestly unsure of what to do. I'll just let her rest for now. Maybe she will be feeling better tomorrow.

01.30.Unknown Year

	Mothers condition appears to be worse today. I tried feeding her to keep her strength up, but she couldn't keep it down. I didn't eat my rations today. It didn't feel right with my mom unable to stomach anything. She spent most of the day asleep. One of the few moments she was conscious, she spoke to me. 
	""I'm so happy I have you to take care of me. It's been so hard. I'm grateful you're in my life."" 
	""Of course, I feel the same about you."" I responded. ""You dedicated so much of your time taking care of me through the years. It's my turn to take care of you."" 	
	She grinned. It was subtle and weak, but I could see it. A tear rolled down her cheek. ""You've taken care of yourself all this time. I had nothing to do with it. You're a smart and handsome man. We survived this long because of you."" I felt my heart flutter as my eyes started to water. 
	Then she said something unexpected. Looking me dead in the eyes. My mom said, ""I'm so happy you're here now. But have you seen Adam? My heart sank. ""Michael, have you seen Adam around? He'd be so happy to see you."" I smiled trying to hold back tears. ""Get some rest, I'll look for him."" I put her to bed, checked her IV, then sat on my bed crying until I couldn't cry anymore.
	I've not said but, my name is Adam. Mothers name is Beth, and my father 's named Michael. I look like my dad in the face but not the body. He was a burly man who wore glasses and always rolled up his sleeves. I've taken to wearing an old pair of his glasses to help read labels. His clothes are so big on me, I have to roll up my sleeves and pant legs just to fit. There was a resemblance. Though just.
	Mothers symptoms are getting worse. I'm reading these medical books and nothing makes sense. I'm at a complete loss. I'm afraid if this goes on much longer she won't make it. I can't think about that but it's becoming more and more likely. I don't think I'm ready for that. Ready to say goodbye. Or ready to be alone…

02.01.Unknown Year

	Today something even weirder happened. Mother was sleeping. I was making a house of cards. All of a sudden the radio has broadcast nothing but static for as long as I can remember. Shot to life, It was a man's voice, repeating "" 51 . 21 . 25 . 52 . 32 . 41 . 24 . 34 . MESSAGE WILL REPEAT..."" It played for a solid ten minutes. Half way through the third echo my mother stirred. She didn't quite wake up, but she spoke.""Michael, Michael, where are you?"" I went to her side and rubbed her back. She drifted back to her slumber. 
	I don't know what to make of all of this. I think the message was some type of code. Maybe a government message? That means there's likely people still up there, and maybe there's still a government. It has me rethinking the door. I'm not that big, but I'm quite a bit stronger than the last time I tried.
	Right now all I know is. I need to take care of my mom. She's becoming more and more delirious. She barely calls me by my name anymore. She's deathly skinny now. I'm going to keep her comfortable. I've accepted I only have so much time left with her. I'm going to spend it well.

02.21.Unknown Year

	Mother passed the fourth of February. She died in the early hours of the morning. It was peaceful, toward the end she agreed to the pain medicine.  I took some time to process and empty a third of my liquor supply. I had to get creative with the burial. That said, it wasn't really a burial. 
	I had to cut up my mother into tiny pieces. It took several attempts to get the job done. Then I stored the pieces in old jars. Safe till I use her remains to fuel the generator. I know it sounds gruesome and trust me it was. Unfortunately one person's refusal isn't enough to power this place consistently. So I'm forced to burn my mother.	
	I'm doing what I can to stay numb and not think about it. My usual remedy is some pain pills washed down with whiskey. After a few rounds I'm right as rain. That was the only way I could bring myself to write this.
	 Today was my birthday. For the special day I got to top the tank off with my moms left foot. Happy birthday to me right? 
	I have a new goal. I'm gonna get through that door, however I can. The radio comes on at the same time every week ever since the first. Just like clockwork, it came at midday. It plays for ten minutes then stops. I swear it doesn't sound automated. It sounds like someone is actually speaking each time, there's slight differences each time and pauses at points. But it's the same message. "" 51 . 21 . 25 . 52 . 32 . 41 . 24 . 34 . MESSAGE WILL REPEAT..."" There has to be someone out there. Making these messages. There must be. Someone, anyone... Tomorrow I begin.

02.22.Unknown Year

	I started the day early. I made coffee and went right to the door. I spent a solid five minutes just standing there staring. Eventually I gathered myself and began inspecting the door. My geiger counter was starting to tick at that point. I didn't care. I needed a way out.
	After looking for a while I have a couple ideas. The door itself is a thick metal. However it appears dad used the original door frame. It's made out of, what at this point is over a hundred years old, wood. There's only about a quarter inch showing all the way around. I may be able to chip the frame away from around the hinges.
	I looked around for a chisel or something sturdy and sharp. All I found was the rusty machete I used to dismember mom.
	I began chopping at the door frame. Methodical, and as targeted as possible. After a few hours, I have taken away a good chunk of the frame at the top hinge. However I was unable to chop deep enough to free any of the bolts securing it. I'll have to think of something else.
	Also, I started feeling nauseous after a while, I had stopped listening to the steady tick of my geiger counter. No doubt the sickness is a symptom of exposure. I'm going to take some meds. But I have to get out of here quickly. I can't die down here. I have to know. I have to see.

02.24.Unknown Year

	I spent all of yesterday brainstorming. I'd found those shotgun shells, found out they were slugs. I figured that'd  be enough to get through the frame. After further thought I've settled on a pipe gun. I have a four foot and a few two and three inch pipes. As well as a few connectors and caps. Luckily the shells fit perfectly in the pipe.
	I spent today trying different contraptions. Without a drill to make a guide hole in the cap for the makeshift firing pin. I was forced to use a burlap sack instead.
	The design, that I'm mostly sure is going to work, needs to be assembled for each shot. I take the four foot pipe and place a shell in the end, next I put a connector over that end. Then I add a two inch pipe onto that. I stretch a piece of burlap over the opening and place a filed down construction nail, makeshift firing pin, directly in the center making sure it is barely making contact with the shell. I put a cap on the end and tighten it up to the head of the nail. 
	All I should need to do is pont the pipe and hit the cap with a hammer. If my design will actually work. I only have eight shells and I need to free three hinges. Here's hoping I don't need them all.
	I spent a lot of time today working on my ""gun"". I'm going to eat extra rations tonight. Make a few stiff drinks. Then pack and prepare for tomorrow. If everything goes to plan. I should be out of here by midday tomorrow. Now if only I could quit puking. This may be my last entry. I'll come back for the logs when I can. I want my mothers memory to live on.
	It's getting late. Wish me luck. I'm going to bed.

02.28.1976

	I started the twenty-fifth of February early in the morning. I had my pipe gun and a go bag. I was wearing my moms gas mask. I kissed then pocketed my moms wedding ring. I was ready.
	I gripped the pipe and placed the end right up against the frame at the top hinge. Just as I had envisioned. I smacked the cap of the pipe gun and BOOM! It fired. I was blown away by how well it worked. All of the wood around the hinge was completely blown through. I could see daylight through the hole. My singing geiger counter kept me from celebrating for too long.
	I quickly reloaded. I took aim at the second hinge. Wound up and... CLANG! ""Crap."" I thought I tried again. CLANG! One more time. CLANG! Has to be a dud shell. I reload again, take aim and. BOOM! The top of the middle hinge was blown free but it still had two bolts attached. I tried again with another shell. BOOM! The hinge blew back at me. There were shards of wood all over. The constant ticking picking up speed. 
	WIth four shells left and only one hinge left. I was confident it wouldn't be much longer. I lined up a shot on the bottom hinge. BOOM! A crack ran all the way through the rest of the doorframe. It was still attached. One final shot. I line it up. CLANG! ""Shit. Only two left."" I loaded my penultimate shell and said a small prayer to my parents. ""Okay one, two, thr..""BOOM!
	The last hinge was free! I pulled the door down along with my mask and took my first steps outside. It was so bright when I first emerged. I was essentially blind for a few minutes. After a bit my eyes finally adjusted. There were barrels everywhere around the bunker door. Yellow and white barrels. They all made my geiger counter scream. I looked around and saw an old house in the distance with smoke coming out of the chimney.
	""People!"" I thought. I started rushing towards the house. Once clear of the barrels I stopped registering radiation. I decided to try with my mask off. I could hardly see with it on. Part of me expected my first breath to burn. To my surprise the air was cool and had more moisture than my lungs had ever felt. The sudden sensation soothed my hoarse throat. I looked around and took in my surroundings on the way to the house. The trees seemed bare,  but the grass was green and the sky a blue grey. I was 200 yards from the shelter at that point and was gasping up the fresh air.
	Everything didn't seem destroyed like mom said. It looked like winter from the pictures I've seen. ""Maybe the government has already started cleaning the irradiated areas.""
	As I approached the house I noticed a couple of well dressed women stood on the porch. I started sprinting and shouting. ""HELLO! I NEED HELP! I'M A SURVIVOR!"" They looked up suddenly, they didn't speak. The one closer to the door, the older of the two, went inside.The other woman kept from catching my gaze. She looked about my age. She looked healthy, but compared to my thin frame most would. After a moment or so, a large man with glasses and a big grey beard appeared. I'd never met anyone other than my mom, yet he felt familiar. He pushed up his glasses whilst calming his partners. As I took my first step onto the porch He motioned the ladies inside then looked me up and down. Crossed his arms and said. ""Adam.... come inside we need to talk...""

I’ve been with my partner for over two years and I think many of our recent issues stem from my critical & comparison thoughts. Sometimes it just overwhelms me and I can’t keep it in! I read last night that it’s fairly typical to compare our partners to our friend’s partners or depictions of relationships in the media, etc. But I’m wondering if anyone has any strategies for this?! 

Here are some examples: hearing how my friend’s partner is super touchy feely and then wondering why he isn’t that way or hearing about other’s romantic acts and wondering why they haven’t happened in our relationship or hearing about his brother offering to pick him up even though it’s out of the way when last week my partner asked me to come to him so then I wonder why he can’t be more generous or seeing someone online who writes their partner love notes and wondering why that doesn’t happen. It’s quite mentally exhausting and I don’t want to share these thoughts as I know they are hurtful and unfair. 

Of note (added information): he does show up in many ways, he encourages me and lifts me up in regards to my self-esteem and my self-image, he always tries to help make things easier (ex. Offering to go pick me up a coffee so I can get ready for work at home), he surprised me one night after work with flowers (doesn’t happen often but has happened!), he is physically affectionate each day, he looks after our plants, he takes on a lot at home with cooking, etc, he’s patient and kind, the list goes on.

I never thought I'd grow up to have a liking towards them but somehow a few left in my care has made me like them all. I have a few plants, few flowering ones, few succulents and few others that I have managed to look after for a little over 10 years now. Yeah you heard that right, i am planning to organize them into a small garden in my roof but I'm letting it happen naturally.

Wait did I just say roof? Yeah so i love the sky, i just sit there sipping hot coffee with some old tunes watching the sky as the sun sets and clouds morph into whatever i wanna see XD, we can just draw stuff and it's so fun when in clouds, oh i also swim, i think that's the closest thing that makes me feel like I'm flying and as i like the sky i really like it, although I am a bit burnt out as I'm at it since a kid. But I do try to go often.

So that's a bit about this 26 year old fool. Now what do I seek? You. I don't mind what you are, where you're from to be fair, but I have met a handful of my online friends, so I wanna make more connections which feels strangely wonderful and new everytime. I also am open to whatever it leads to. Don't bother writing a huge intro as I'd like to get to know you as we talk, but a lil bit would be nice, I'd prefer if you were 24 and above though.

I’m Nico, 28, from germany, living on Mallorca for the past 4 years, working as a worker / air conditioning technician. I did my training in Germany, so I’m basically one of those guys who save your summer with a working AC 😅❄️

Right now I’m in a bit of a wild situation (the reasons are private, but pretty intense, happy to share over a coffee or beer). Long story short: I’m without a place to stay until July 15th, and I’m urgently looking for a place to crash for one night, maybe two if it works out.

I’m easygoing, respectful, helpful, don’t snore, and I come with a pretty crazy story to tell. I’d be super grateful for any help 🙏

Just don’t make me sleep outside with the mosquitoes they like me way too much. A sofa, mattress, terrace , anything’s better than being outdoor snack material. 

Bonus point: I know the island really well ,if you ever need local tips, hidden beaches, shortcuts, or honest advice, I’ve got you covered. 😉
If you can help or know someone who might, just drop me a DM.

Thanks so much in advance and no matter what: stay cool (or come rescue me, we’ll figure it out 😂)

The main issue right now is my brain wants that dopamine hit and when it doesn’t get it in the day I feel like I don’t want to go to bed, I just want to play video games or scroll looking for that dopamine hit. Then it makes me more groggy the next day which I use as an excuse to be anti social. It’s kind of a cycle because if I was less groggy being social would be easier and make me happier, therefore I would feel satisfied going to sleep at a normal time like I do when I drink coffee. 

Part of me thinks that the down/groggy feeling is a part of the withdrawal and it will go away with time, but I don’t want to form a bad habit just to quit a different bad habit. I formed the caffeine habit in the first place because of my insomnia, idk if it actually helped or if I just formed better habits because of my predictable schedule but for a while there I had no issues going to bed. 

I’m thinking I might tough it out for a few more weeks and see if I can fix my sleep schedule with just willpower. But honestly if it comes down to a coffee habit or a lack of sleep I might have to pick coffee. Alternatively I could talk to my dr about getting medication for depression or a sleep aid, but honestly those are so much less predictable than coffee, I’ve never had a medication that’s helped for more than six months and it just isn’t worth the trouble of experimenting with finding the right medication and dosage.

So I (22F) have been in a situationship with this guy - let’s call him Liam (23M)—for almost a year now. It started shortly after a horrible breakup with my ex, Ryan (26M), who was extremely toxic and manipulative. That breakup was so messy that both our families got involved. Ryan constantly played mind games, made me feel like I was too much, too emotional, too expensive & just too everything. Meanwhile, he worked in the merchant navy and always bragged about how rich he was, yet I was the one paying for most of our dates—literally 80% of the time.

He’d flex hard in front of his friends—buying drinks, acting like a baller—but when it came to me, suddenly he had “financial responsibilities.” He’d say he couldn’t spend on me because he needed to take care of his retired parents. But plot twist: his dad told my parents that he doesn’t contribute a single rupee at home because his dad receives a solid pension from working in the oil rig industry for 25+ years and his mom works from home for fun. But somehow, I was labelled the gold digger when we broke up because I “expected too much.” Go figure.

Anyway—enter Liam.

Liam came into my life when I was still grieving that breakup. At first, he felt like a breath of fresh air. He was sweet, funny, easy to talk to. We’d talk for hours and I felt this deep emotional connection that I hadn’t felt with anyone before. I could genuinely call him my best friend.

But here’s the thing: slowly I started noticing patterns that didn’t sit right with me.

We both work nearby, and we usually get off at the same station. Every day he calls those 2-minute post-work walks “meeting up.” That’s our quality time apparently. If we ever actually hang out, it’s always at my place, but only if it’s empty—so yeah, you get the idea. After that, it’s me who ends up ordering food, paying for drinks, basically playing hostess and ATM.

He’s never once planned a proper date, never gone out of his way to do something for me—not even something small. I don’t even remember the last time he brought me a coffee or a bar of chocolate or just showed effort.

Recently, he sent me a reel where the girl was paying for her boyfriend, and I joked (not really joking) that “This is literally me.” I added that I don’t mind paying but sometimes I just want to be pampered too. Is that so wrong? His response? Silence. Not a joke, not reassurance. Just… nothing.

Then just a week ago, he actually said he was planning to take me out for dinner and I got really excited thinking—okay, maybe he does care. But the day before, he told me he couldn’t because he had to take out a loan to repay his sister. I didn’t get mad, I didn’t argue—I believed him. He’s shared stuff about his family’s financial issues before, and I’ve always tried to be understanding and supportive. But deep down, it’s hard not to feel like this is a pattern. That I’m always the one compromising, giving, understanding, adjusting.

We’ve also had the “what are we” talk a few times. I told him that I want something serious, and that I’m not looking for a dead-end dynamic where I’m emotionally and physically available but not chosen. His response? “Everyone leaves. Relationships are just fake promises.” I told him if that’s the case, I’d rather leave than stay stuck in limbo. But he didn’t let me go. He keeps pulling me back in with emotional vulnerability and late-night conversations and that soft version of himself that I’ve grown attached to. But he never gives me clarity.

And now I’m here. Confused. Hurt. Tired. I feel like I’m giving so much and receiving the bare minimum. He says I mean a lot to him, that I’m not just some girl he’s messing around with—but I don’t feel loved. I feel used. For my space, my time, my body, my money, my emotional support. And yet I feel guilty for even thinking that, because he’s not evil. He’s not outright mean. He does care—at least a little. But is that enough?

So I guess my question is:
Am I being used?
Am I stupid for staying?
Do I leave even if it hurts like hell to cut off someone who feels like my best friend?

I want to believe this is real. I want to believe that not all guys who say “relationships are fake” are just emotionally unavailable man-babies. But I don’t know anymore.

Do you think she'd have been more thorough in her work and created a M3gan that, for a lack of a better term, wasn't mentally unstable? Or would M3gan going rogue be inevitable?

Pros, 

\- As an Ambassador I was upgraded to a king size one room suite

\- The Lounge serves a full Buffet breakfast in the morning and they provide coffee, snacks and a quiet atmosphere the rest of the day. 

\- They have a mini shuttle that takes you 3 miles around the hotel for free, plus you can call them and they will also pick you up and bring you back.

\- There is a nice pool and there were lots of people enjoying the hot July weather.

  
Cons, 

\- The property is outdated and needs some upgrades.

\- There is a $32+Tax daily parking fee

\- The staff is super nice, but they lack of hospitality professionalism. I had house keeping came in my room while I was on a conf call, House keeping left a plastic bag with towels on the room after servicing it, and at checkin I was told that I would get a discount for parking, and then 2 hours later they called my room to let me know that it was not going to be possible since I was already upgraded on the room. Front desk was supper apologetic but Manager told her it was a no no . 

Overall it was a nice stay that served its purpose. I would stay there again if I was planning to use the pool and hang out at the hotel, but would try some other property if I was using the property just for sleeping.     ",2,1751646802.0,marriott,0,0.75,False

I tried keto, fasting, detox teas, gym memberships, apps… everything. I'd lose 5-10 lbs, then gain back 15. It wasn’t even about food sometimes. It was emotional. I’d eat when I was bored, sad, stressed, or just feeling empty. And every time I failed, I’d tell myself I had no discipline. i felt broken.
Then last year something just snapped. I hit 248 lbs. I remember sitting in my car one night after eating an entire pizza alone, and I just cried. Not like a few tears, I mean full-on breakdown. That was the moment. Not because I felt fat. But because I felt like I had no control over my own life anymore.
I decided to stop chasing big changes. I didn’t start with a gym. I didn’t start a strict diet. I just promised myself one thing: I would walk for 20 minutes every day. Rain or shine. That’s it.
Week 1 was rough. My legs hurt, I was breathing heavy, but I did it. Then week 2, I added drinking more water. No soda, just water and coffee. Then week 3, I cut out nighttime snacking. That was hard as hell. But by then I had built a little momentum. I didn’t want to break my streak,
I didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t post anything online. It was just me vs me. I focused on building habits, not chasing a number. By month 2, I added simple home workouts. Nothing crazy. Just bodyweight stuff I found on YouTube. I started meal prepping because I knew if I came home tired and hungry, I'd eat whatever was around.
Fast forward 6 months, I was down 42 lbs. No fancy plan. No magic pill. Just small consistent steps and a lot of internal work. Therapy also helped me understand why I was turning to food. That changed everything.
I still struggle sometimes. I still crave junk. But now I don’t feel like a prisoner in my own body. I feel like I’m finally driving again, not just sitting in the backseat of my own life.

This water boiler and warmer is more than just an appliance; it feels like an upgrade to my kitchen and my overall tea-making game. With a sleek, white polished exterior and its compact dimensions (11.88""L x 9.13""W x 13.13""H), it fits perfectly on my countertop without eating up too much space. The design is clean, modern, and functional, making it a delightful addition to my kitchen. I’ll say, it was hard to miss how well-built and sturdy it feels—something you’d expect from a Japanese-manufactured product with a reputation for durability.

**Ease of Use and Features**  
The first thing I noticed was how intuitive the controls were. With a micro-computerized temperature control system, I could easily toggle between four keep-warm temperature settings: 160°F, 175°F, 195°F, and 208°F. These pre-set options make it perfect for tea enthusiasts or even someone brewing French press coffee like me. The optional Quick Temp Mode was a game-changer; it kept the water warm without boiling, which is not only energy efficient but also ideal for green or white teas that taste better at lower temperatures. Trust me—having precise control over water temperature feels luxurious when you’re picky about your drinks.

**Check [Zojirushi CD-LFC50] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Everyday Use**  
What really makes this boiler stand out is how consistent the water temperature remains once it reaches the desired setting. Whether I was brewing a herbal tea at 208°F late at night or simply needing warm water for instant ramen, the machine didn’t falter. The 169-ounce capacity (5 liters) is plenty for large households or anyone who consumes countless cups of tea and coffee. It also has this handy timer function that allowed me to program the appliance to start warming hours before I woke up. The swivel base is another small but impactful feature—it allowed everyone in the family to easily dispense water, no matter where they stood around the counter.

**Advantages**  
- Easy-to-read Panorama Window gauge for precise water level detection  
- Energy-saving timer function (up to 10 hours)  
- Nonstick interior simplifies the cleaning process  
- Quick Temp Mode prevents unnecessary boiling  
- Cafe Drip mode for a slower water dispensing option  

**Design Detailing and Build Quality**  
The attention to design is apparent even in the smallest details. For someone who values aesthetics, the polished white finish adds a subtle elegance while still being easy to maintain. The Panorama Window water level gauge is surprisingly helpful; thanks to the clear markings, I can see exactly how much water is inside. The nonstick interior is a godsend! I only need to hand wash it occasionally, and the descaling mode keeps the inside spotless with minimal effort. Another major plus is the detachable power cord, which adds a layer of safety, especially when young children are around.

**Limitations**  
- Not ideal for small households due to its size  
- Warm settings don’t go below 160°F, limiting versatility for less conventional uses  
- Slightly pricier when compared to similar models  

**Other Options**  
When I compared the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 to competitive models like the Panasonic water boiler or Tiger PDU-A50U-K, it became evident where this unit shines. While similar products also boast temperature presets, Zojirushi’s Quick Temp Mode offers superior energy-saving functionality. Moreover, its nonstick feature and panorama window elevate the overall user experience, something missing in many rival brands. However, the Tiger boiler does have a stainless steel shell, which might be appealing to those who prioritize a metal design over a polished finish. That said, the Zojirushi’s thoughtful features and consistency made the extra cost justifiable for my needs.

**Price Performance**  
While this product isn't exactly cheap, I found its value exceptional when you consider the features and durability it brings. The timer function alone has saved me countless minutes, while the energy-saving aspects make it less of an electricity hog compared to older-style boilers. If you’re a heavy tea or coffee drinker, the Zojirushi CD-LFC50 is worth every penny. Rarely do appliances feel so tailored for convenience and reliability.

1lrmzln,https://www.reddit.com/r/babyloss/comments/1lrmzln/i_feel_like_a_useless_friend/,I feel like a useless friend,"TW: living children

Three years ago, I lost my firstborn, my son, at 33 weeks. I miss him with my entire being. 

In those early days, I remember getting very frustrated and angry at the people around me at the time. Due to things they said or things they did. Sometimes this was deserving but other times it was from resentment for how their life went on while mine felt like it was over. I lost our son near the weekend of the Queens jubilee, and I remember laying in my bed, in so much emotional pain, while listening to our neighbours have BBQs and street parties. And I remember thinking ""I wish I were out there too. I wish my world hadn't ended"". 

And now three year later I have two living daughters, a dog and although I struggle, I also have discovered happiness again, which once felt impossible. 

But now, my dear friend is losing her pregnancy (despite being anonymous, I feel wrong sharing the details of this). While our situations are different, parts of it are very similar. 

She reached out to me knowing my history and...I didn't know what to say. And I feel so wrong to not know what to say. Surely I should know considering Im part of this community? I know nothing can take her pain away but surely I would have an idea?

And I desperately want to carry the pain for her - I know the pain and I've learnt to carry it and I just want to say ""give it to me, I can do this"". I obviously don't want to feel the intense pain you get when your in the midst of it again but I can't stand knowing how she must be feeling and knowing I can't do anything. I know from experience that nothing I say will bring her her baby and bring her peace. I feel useless.

Selfishly, I'm also being reminded of my own journey of baby loss, Im getting flashbacks and I just feel so shaken and quite angry at the world. 

I guess I have found some forgiveness for those around me in those early days. There really is nothing to say - nothing that can take the pain away. Some pain has to be felt.

I also feel guilty, because today I cleared out my garage and had iced coffee with my partner and laughed together and suddenly I'm like the neighbour holding the street party, while my friends life has paused.

I don't really have a point to this post but...I feel useless. And I feel sad. The pain of it all is so bloody cruel x

I’m 31 years old and pregnant for the first time. My caffeine addiction started my freshman year of college (go figure). I was initially super, super sensitive to caffeine. But I drank and drank to the point where, before getting pregnant, it would be normal for me to start my day with 3-4 cups of hot coffee. Then, when I’d get to work Id go over with my coworkers to get an iced latte from the coffee shop across the street- I would always have a quad shot, of course. And lots of days I would even have a 200mg celcius in the afternoon. On top of this, my caffeine addiction has even caused panic attacks, chronic anxiety, and heart palpitations accompanied by dizziness that I’ve had to be seen in the ER for. I was always in denial that this was solely bc of my caffeine consumption, though. Always saying, yeah maybe my caffeine intake has been making these conditions, which probably already existed, slightly worse. But it surely isn’t affecting me THAT much. UNTIL, I found out I was pregnant a few weeks ago. (I’m 7 weeks today) when I first did my research I saw that a cup or two of coffee a day would be just fine. It seemed like around 200mg daily intake is where things started getting iffy so I just decided that, since a cup of coffee is 65mg ish, I would just stick to that so that I’d stay well below the danger zone. Like the good mother-to-be I thought I was, I swapped my morning coffee with decaf, I would make an iced coffee, measuring out the appropriate amount of caffeinated coffee and then topping it off with decaf iced coffee. This went on for maybe 2 days. By day 3, I stopped drinking my coffee bc I was a bit nauseous. By the end of the first week I was so down horribly bad that I couldn’t even stomach the thought of drinking that iced coffee. I couldn’t stomach the thought of eating anything. I became terribly tired, sleeping 14 hours straight on my day off one day. Another day, I was awake only 5 hours out of a 24 hour period. Moments awake were accompanied by scrolling on my phone to try to distract myself from my waves of nausea- even actually throwing up once- even though I would sometimes even have to avoid looking at my phone bc the scrolling made me so sick. I noticed muscle twitching next. I thought, since I wasn’t eating or drinking, it must be because I’m so terribly dehydrated. Then the muscle cramps came, and terrible abdominal pain. Severe bloating and constipation. I would always have the chills, and then get terribly hot. I kept telling everybody I felt physically ill. I said that I didn’t even feel pregnant, I just felt SICK. I chalked it all up to first trimester miseries, even though my symptoms were so, so much worse than anyone around me had experienced. Then…. Oh my good Lord, then…. Yesterday, after having been so nauseous that I took a Dramamine (motion sickness pill) as a last ditch attempt to get rid of my nausea, I layed down for a nap. When I woke up, I didn’t realize that my left leg had fallen asleep, and in my drug-induced, lethargic, dehydrated, malnourished state I started to walk, lost my balance, twisted my ankle, heard a loud ‘pop!’ and fell to the ground screaming in pain. (Currently waiting on my xray results) after leaving urgent care last night I was so miserable that I had my husband take me to the store bc I wanted some Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and thought maybe I could pick up some Mio water flavor to help me drink water, since even the thought of water was making me gag. I got home, ate the entire pint of icecream, and drank 2-18oz glasses of water with the mio flavoring in it! I thought this must be the key to staying hydrated. Later that night,I had some inexplicable diarrhea (tmi, sorry). And when I laid down to go to bed, I remember saying out loud to my husband, “you know how some people have restless leg syndrome? Well I feel like I have restless BODY syndrome. I just can’t stay still!!” I ended up falling asleep, although very restlessly all night. When I woke up this morning to go take my X-rays,  I had another 18 oz glass of water with that mio. I texted my mom and sister, saying how I felt so much better today- how I had more energy and I wasn’t nearly as nauseous. I even went GROCERY SHOPPING, which was WAYYYY more productive than I had been in the last week and a half.  I got home, started to cook, and (would you have guessed it?) I ate more food in one sitting than I had been able to keep down in days!! In order to keep things moving in the right direction, I went to go make more flavored water with the mio…. And I stopped dead in my tracks. I looked down at that little bottle and saw in big, bold letters the word, “ENERGY,” smack dab in the middle of the packaging. I slowly turned the bottle to the side to inspect the nutrition information. 90mg of caffeine per squirt…. I had had four “squirts” last night…. And two already this morning…. And all of my miserable symptoms were… gone. Totally gone. Completely and utterly gone! I thought to myself…. “You stupid f*ck. Caffeine. Have you been withdrawing from caffeine this WHOLE TIME. And then on top of that…. All my unknowing progress I must have made in quitting caffeine is ruined now since I “relapsed” unknowingly. This has got to be the most severe withdrawal ever. I think this needs published in a textbook or something. I am dumbfounded and not really sure where to go from here…. And don’t even get me started about my worries for my baby. I hope and pray that the sudden rush of caffeine hasn’t done any damage. Could it have just been one big coincidence? Could this have been all normal pregnancy symptoms? Could the sudden relief in constipation explain why all my symptoms have been relieved? Yes. But also, I think I have a lot to learn from this experience.

Hey guys! I get paid on Monday, so I’m trapped here in my house all weekend just waiting on my paycheck to hit. You guys know how it goes. 😭😭

I had unexpected things happen this pay period that was unavoidable that I had to pay so I’m just glad I was able to cover that, even if it means having $5 to last me a few days haha.

I work in finance, so I have three whole days off to myself right now! Which would be absolutely lovely if I had any money at all to enjoy myself. This would be such a perfect time for me to get into a game. It’s really depressing to have to just sit in your house like this. I’ve been wanting to play Stardew Valley for years now. It looks like it is going to mean the WORLD to me once I finally am able to play it!!

I just want to build my little farm, and run around meeting all of the different characters! You can even get married and have kids in this game! People get so addicted to it and I just want to get absorbed into the world and forget about all of my problems and burdens for a little bit. Just pour a cup of my ice coffee and stay up way too late ❤️

My life has become just me working. That is all I do. I guess that’s just how life is going to be nowadays from here on out. I guess that’s what’s normal, right? I don’t know. It’s really depressing and the only relief I get is from playing a good game, and this is one I’ve really been wanting to try for a while now. I just want to feel happy if only for a little bit overnight. : )

I would so so so so appreciate it and be so grateful if a gamer out there would help me to get the game! I promise that’s all I wanna do, I can send pictures of my switch and me buying/playing it!

Sorry if this is so silly!! Happy Fourth everyone!!

1lrmqpa,https://www.reddit.com/r/ENFPandINTJ/comments/1lrmqpa/intj_ended_things_with_me_before_they_really/,"INTJ ended things with me before they really started, keeps watching my stories","Hi everyone, ENFP here (35F) on a burner account to protect the privacy of the person I’m about to discuss. I’m hoping to get a little bit of clarity and advice on an INTJ I ended things with \~3 months ago. Forgive me for how long and detailed this is going to be. I’m hoping these details are salient for any thoughts you’re willing to offer. 

Let me begin by sharing three details that I think led him to believe we’re not compatible in the long term. I keep this in mind at all times; it helps me stay sane in the decision I made to walk away without fighting it.

1. He (38M) is a very elegant and intellectual person, as I get the impression most INTJs are. French Canadian culture is central to his identity. I am an American living in Montreal for grad school and am contemplating permanent residency after graduation. He speaks English well but told me the only time he uses it in his day to day life is with me, and I think it pained him that he wasn’t “better” at it (his English is great if you ask me, and my French is virtually nonexistent) because he’s very cerebral and likely felt he couldn’t go as deep as he needed to with me. 
2. He’s had two serious girlfriends in his past, 4-5 years each. He told me he tends to date women who are extremely emotional, who he kind of has to caretake emotionally, and that the first girlfriend clung very, very hard to the relationship and made it difficult to break up, so he had to try to break up with her twice before it was finally over. The second one ended four years ago, she is definitely the phantom ex. He told me of his own accord that things ended with her abruptly, that they had purchased a home after 3 years of being together, but that she ended things with him suddenly, 6 months after purchasing the place. He admitted to me that at that time he’d been in a difficult place with his career, wasn’t the best version of himself, and one day she just announced she couldn’t do it anymore. Evidently they are in the same friend group, and after breaking up she was very emotional running into him again, they hooked up one more time, then he said they mutually decided it was best not to be together. He told me he hangs out with in their friend group like 10 times a year, that it’s all good and casual, she has a boyfriend now, blah blah. I get the sense that he’s still either hung up on that last girlfriend or at least traumatized by the way it ended. I think he is still deeply wounded by that and doesn't really trust women, maybe some mommy issues too. I’m no therapist but if I had to guess, his relationship style is possibly fearful avoidant.
3. I explicitly told him that I am not compatible with emotional unavailability. He readily admitted to me from the beginning that emotional vulnerability is one of his biggest struggles. 

We matched on Hinge. Upon meeting I sensed by the look in his eyes that we were both pleasantly surprised by how attractive the other was. By the end of our great first date, it was obvious the chemistry was so intense that we were definitely going to see each other again. He texted me right away and the momentum grew. He was consistent about texting good night and good morning each day. At the end of a perfect second date he said, “I really want to kiss you.” To which I responded, well, are you gonna? 

And from there I fell hard. On our third date he told me his style was only to date one woman at a time because he feels it’s “unfair” to her otherwise. As a cute gal I’m lucky to say I receive a lot of matches on Hinge and was seeing another guy about a week before I met the INTJ. I let him know to start I’d prefer to take it slow and only go on one date a week. I also told him I wanted to avoid intimacy too soon, otherwise I could get prematurely attached. He told me that in his experience, when he’s said those same things to a woman, it was because he was trying to keep things casual with her, so he was a little hurt. I apologized and told him that definitely wasn’t my intention. I internalized that conversation and decided to stop seeing another guy I was casually dating after 4 dates, as he was starting to get more committed and I didn’t want to lead him on. I’m divorced and have spent the past 3 years working on healing my anxious attachment to the emotionally unavailable person I was married to. Being intentionally single has been so healing. I am absolutely disinterested in playing games, especially with a man I have feelings for. So I let the INTJ know my own intentions on the fourth date—that I was also interested in only seeing him, that I didn’t want to mess things up. In hindsight that was my anxious attachment driving. I’m sorry to say I wish I’d just kept dating others for a while longer, because I think that spooked him. I’d basically announced the chase was prematurely over and I can see now that from that point he very slowly and extremely subtly withdrew. 

We dated for 6-7 weeks. I was so awkward and shy with him in ways I never am with other men. We had hours-long chats where we were always in physical contact (his initiation), either holding hands or his hand on my leg, neither of us ever checking our phones together, totally losing track of time. He admitted that he struggles intensely with vulnerability and wasn’t raised by emotionally available parents, so physical touch was the only love language he felt comfortable with and fluent in. A red flag to me was when he gently pushed back on my reluctance to get physically intimate too quickly. He said it wasn’t a big deal to him to have sex with people, basically, and that he’d had a string of casual hookups for the past year but nothing that stuck. In hindsight I guess I know I fumbled by breaking my own boundary and sleeping with him on date five. After a cute breakfast date in his neighborhood he invited me to go over to his place for the first time, and we chatted on his couch for hours, the chemistry was insane. He took me to dinner afterwards. Once again, I don’t play games and I guess I made things too easy. A marathon 12 hours together, which I know people always advise against in early stages. 

He pulled back suddenly at week 6 the day after we had our second sleepover at his house. As usual, we stayed up late chatting and cuddling, having a lovely time. The pull back was palpable the morning after. I almost felt like I did something wrong, but I know I didn’t. My guess is that maybe he sensed it was starting to potentially get serious between us, and he, an emotionally unavailable INTJ, felt that we weren’t ultimately compatible. We went on a yoga date together and afterwards he drove me home. We sat in the car and I waited a bit to get out of the car, assuming he would kiss me goodbye. Instead, he said, “what are you waiting for?” When I communicated my confusion about his not seeming to want to give me a proper goodbye, he said, “I’m just toying with you.”

The tenor of the whole date had been distant, but in that moment I had a strong gut feeling things were slowly but surely ending between us. The following day he texted, “I hope you had a nice night and sweet dreams :) And also I wanted to apologize for yesterday, saying I was toying with you wasn’t a good choice of words and it wasn’t right anyway. The day seems beautiful so far, bonne journée:)”. To which I said, “Good morning:) c’est vraiment une belle journée. I appreciate hearing that; I think yesterday felt a bit like we were strangers. Maybe later you could help me understand what you meant? I hope you have a nice day too.” Four hours later he replied, “Yes :) I went for a walk on my lunch break, it was nice.” I will say, he was a slow responder from the start, rarely replied to my texts sooner than an hour. Guys I date typically tend to be very responsive; I can be overwhelmed by having to keep up with the texting, and don’t love texting conversations if regular face-to-face meets are an option. So I wasn’t bothered at first by his slower texting style because he was so consisten—it even felt like a green flag. So I matched his energy, that’s just my style. But over time, as the effort on his end waned, the slow drip texting pace began to scream avoidance. 

After that weird date, I invited him to come over to my place the following eve to hang out. I didn’t tell him this, but it was my hope to set a lovely little mood, have some wine, see if we could have a gentle conversation about how to meet each other’s needs and what our expectations were. He agreed to come over, then bailed at the last minute, saying he’d prefer to meet the following day because he was tired from spending time with his family. At that point, I wanted to be put out of my misery, so I invited him to meet me at a coffee shop the morning after he bailed. The weekend before we’d hung out and worked together at this same place; he’d treated me with such public affection, kissed me hello in a way that he hadn’t before. (Interestingly, he’d done his taxes in a way that felt like he was trying to flex the money he makes as a lawyer, it was kind of cute, but now that I think about it, it also showed me that he was maybe a little insecure about what he had to offer?). When he showed up to the cafe, his vibe was so distant, he was withholding affection. Enough so that I wondered if maybe someone else had come into the picture that week. After a little small talk I gently encouraged him to tell me what was wrong, and he said, “I’ve been feeling really sad for the past week. I’m having trouble opening up to you, and I’m not sure what to do. I am having fun and I could keep seeing you for another couple months, but I’m not sure anything with that will change, that I’ll be able to be open with you in the way that you want, and that I’m going to hurt you.”

I felt a pit in my stomach as soon as he started talking, this huge wave of sadness and disappointment. I’d had trouble sleeping for the past week—both my body and mind were being activated into insecure attachment. In that week I realized he was an emotionally unavailable and withholding person, just like my mother and ex-husband, and I was being activated into insecurity by the highs and lows of chasing emotional unavailability. So when I heard him say that, I asked him whether it was anything I’d done, and whether I could do anything different to make him more comfortable. He said he didn’t think so. I gently confirmed with him: so what you’re saying is that you’re just not feeling this vibe? Because if the problem is that you’re just not feeling this, there’s nothing that I can do about that. And I’m not in the business of telling a man how to treat me correctly. 

“Yes, I know,” he said. “I’m really sorry. I think I’m just going to hurt you.” 

I looked him in the eye and said very softly, “Yeah, I think you’re probably right.” 

We were looking into each other’s eyes with sadness. 

“I’m really sorry,” he repeated. 

“It is what it is,” I said. “This is all part of the journey. I’ve been where you are. If you’re just not feeling it, you’re not feeling it. It’s good to know that there are guys like you out there.”

“I’m not so sure that’s true,” he said back to me. He looked really sad. 

After he said that, I said, “Okay. Well, I think I’m going to go.”

He looked surprised. I packed my bag and stood up. I said, “When you’re finished with the two books I loaned you, do you think you could put them in my mailbox?”

Again, he looked really surprised, kind of like, that’s it? He stood up with me. I took his hand and squeezed it, then kissed him on the cheek. As I walked away I felt him reach out to me, his hand brushed against my stomach, like he almost was trying to hold onto me, but I kept walking. I turned around to look at him one last time and it was the saddest eye contact we made. That was three months ago and my heart still breaks writing this.

So that’s the background. If that’s all there was to it, I’d have an easier time letting go. But here’s the part that’s confusing to me, and why I need another INTJ to help me understand what he might be thinking.

When we’d initially met on Hinge, I hadn’t been on the apps in over a year. After 5 days I got an overwhelming number of matches and felt like it was too distracting, so I told the 7 gentlemen who caught my interest that I was deleting the app and if they wanted to keep chatting me they could find me on Instagram. The INTJ follows up on that and DMs me; if I remember correctly I believe he either had to make an IG to contact me or to resuscitate an account he didn’t use. Either way, he had 2 followers and followed 123 people. I realized I couldn’t see who they were because he had a private account and had DM’d me without following me. I found it a little strange but I decided to match his energy and didn’t request to follow, even though he watched all my stories from the beginning. 

After a month of seeing each other I remember he laughed and said, “I’m kind of a stalker,” and I of course loved that. I don’t fall for people easily but if I do yes, please stalk me, I beg you lol. I have two IG accounts; the first one he DM’d me on is the one I post stories to. The second one is where I post on the grid every so often. He went on a vacation and I posted a carousel of images on my secondary IG account. Buried towards the end was a selfie. He texted me later that day saying “I saw that photo of you in the pink shirt. You are beautiful.” Six weeks into seeing him, Instagram started recommending that I follow him on both my accounts, which I playfully mentioned to him. After our second and last sleepover, right before he pulled back, I followed him on the primary account and he followed me back. After we stopped seeing each other, I’ve posted three times, and all of them have been overtures to him. Two were fairly cryptic—I wrote a caption that said, “I hope in a year’s time we can look back on how far we’ve come”—and shared a few images that I think he’s smart enough to put together were for him. And the third post included a photo of a page from his favorite book, buried in the post. After we stopped talking I went out and bought it to read so that I could still feel close to him. I was surprised by how romantic it was. Full of men yearning and not being able to have the love they want. It got me wondering, and here I am.

As of this morning he continues to do that thing everyone complains their exes do: he’s watching all of my stories and saying nothing. It doesn’t occur to me for a second to unfollow him. It’s all love on my end, even if he pulled back that last week and almost pushed me into a nervous break. I shared an abridged version of the details above with my brother. He listened intently and said, “I kept waiting for you to tell me something about the situation where I could encourage you to go after him. But I hear nothing.” He’s telling me to stay away from him, that this man will just ruin me emotionally. As an intelligent, fully-grown woman, I’m sadly inclined to agree. But I keep thinking about the way the INTJ looked at me when I left the cafe, the way his hand felt reaching out to waist as I walked away. The feelings I get every time I see he’s watched my story, even if my brother says it’s the ultimate low-effort meaningless breadcrumb. I think about the way I’ll feel the day he stops watching. 

This INTJ taught me that I am absolutely no longer sleeping with a man without commitment. I’ve seen the light. I am casually going on dates now and more or less living my life like I’ll never see him again. But after reading the book, I've been wondering what it would be like to reach out to him, and whether it'd be a mistake to. I've been wondering what i'd be like to start seeing him again on a new footing, this time while seeing others and actually letting things play out. I’ve been on the INTJ forums trying to understand whether there’s any point in reaching out, or whether he’s “just a stalker” and treating me like a source of validation in a weird way. I’m an ENFP and a lover girl, I’m not afraid of being vulnerable. But he's the one who ended things, and I don’t want to waste my time and re-break my heart.
