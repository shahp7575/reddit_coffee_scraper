1q131c2,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1q131c2/my_66_year_old_father_sleeps_only_34_hours_a/,My 66 year old father sleeps only 3-4 hours a night MAXIMUM (this has gone on for years),"First off I would like to wish everyone a Happy new year everyone! As we know, with a new year comes new year’s resolutions. A major resolution of mine is to take note of my health and the health of my parents who are on their 60s. My father is 66 years old, mildly overweight, has high blood pressure, and a few other health problems. My cause for concern is for years now, my father has only been sleeping 3-4 hours a night, 4-5 hours is very rare. I’ve noticed significant changes in his mood, he’s retired and spends most of his day on his iphone glued to the couch. For most of his life he was an avid gym enthusiast working out and boxing multiple times a day, he always was in top shape and his mind was sharp as a tack. During the pandemic, he caught Covid and almost died, he developed major blood clots in his lungs and his health took a major turn for the worse durring late 2020 and onward. By the grace of god he recovered and Im thankful for everyday I get to spend with him on this earth. 

So, to get to my main concern, since his bout with covid his sleep schedule has been a constant issue that worries me greatly. He tends to knock around around 1:30-2 am most night and then wakes up at 5am- 6 am the latest(and rarely, it’s usually 5-5:30 am). Once he’s awake he immediately orders a coffee and some food from dunkin donuts and is back to being glued to the blue lit iPhone screen for the rest of the day. 

I’ve noticed he’s seemed a lot more spaced out durring conversation, if I sit down durring the day to show him a video on the tv, he’ll begin nodding off and snoring within a minute or two. The funny part is, once I get up and turn the video off, he’ll wake back and he’s right back to engaging on X (twitter) or scrolling through instagram reels. He also seems a lot crankier these days, quick to anger if you try to argue a point, very impatient, and has begun having a lot of “senior moments” where he mixes words up or dates up. 

I love my father to death, he’s my best friend and I want him to be around to see his only child get married and have grandchildren. I never had grandfathers growing up, they both died before I was born and I always thought if I had kids they’d be blessed to have my dad in their life. I hope this wasn’t too long but I appreciate any feedback. I always try and show my pops articles on how important sleep is but it usually goes in one ear and out the other. Once again, I appreciate your time and I look forward to getting any feed back. Thank you :\]",1,1767270154.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1q131bp,https://i.redd.it/l23gcn1zcqag1.jpeg,Finally found a reliable way to buy great specialty coffee,"I live in an area with very limited access to specialty coffee, and ordering from roasters usually means dealing with high shipping costs, import fees, etc.

I recently discovered Hyunah Coffee in Brooklyn through one of Brian Quan’s videos, and it’s been a total game changer. It’s a physical coffee clubhouse in NYC, but for those of us who aren’t local, they offer a $2/month online membership that gives you access to their shop. They curate an incredible selection of coffees that are very hard to source individually - like DAK, Datura, Luminous, and Aviary. If you’re into this side of specialty coffee, I highly recommend checking it out.

Huge shout-out to the owner Hafiz. He’s a massive coffee nerd who genuinely wants to make world-class coffee more accessible. He’s super responsive and clearly cares a lot about the experience.

Positives

I get to take hot showers without budgeting energy and fatigue.

I am able spend more time outside when weather permits such as no rain/snow and heavy winds.

If I start to get hot then I can lose some layers as I often find myself in jeans and heavy cotton tee in +33F temps.

Negative

The cold somehow shrinks my bladder so I piss way too much. My coffee, water, and soda intake has not increased but decreased because I am not hot. Hell I haven’t even had my favorite Captain and Coke Zero since July (I think).

Well no matter what I have become a cold weather guy and the ideal temp bracket is from +33F up to +55F. Don’t get me wrong and I do love to get my sun exposure in the summer but the humidity here is thick enough to cut.

I use “+” for temps as I lived in the interior of AK where the yearly temp swing is -40F in the winter to +99F in the summer (with no native ac installed!). My ideal temp in AK was -22F to +45F.

1q12x03,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1q12x03/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1q12rac,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindfullyDriven/comments/1q12rac/this_mental_model_will_make_you_think_like_a/,This Mental Model Will Make You Think Like a STRATEGIC Genius (Science-Based),"most people operate on autopilot. they copy what others do without questioning if it actually works for them. they chase goals society handed them. they wonder why nothing clicks.

i've spent months diving into mental models from top strategists, watching hours of Dan Koe's content, reading books on systems thinking, listening to podcasts from Navy SEALs to chess grandmasters. turns out there's one framework that separates strategic thinkers from everyone else.

it's called second order thinking. sounds academic but it's stupidly practical.

 what is second order thinking

most people stop at ""what happens next."" strategic people ask ""and then what happens after that?""

you see someone crushing it on social media. first order thinking: ""i should post more content."" second order thinking: ""why is their content working? what problem does it solve? what will happen if i just copy them versus understanding the principles?""

the difference is massive. first order gets you busy. second order gets you results.

here's how it actually works in real life:

relationships: first order is ""i need to text them more to show i care."" second order is ""will constant texting make me seem needy? does this person value space? what dynamic am i actually creating here?""

career: first order is ""i should apply to 100 jobs."" second order is ""what skills do i need that make companies seek me out? how can i build leverage so i'm not competing with thousands of applicants?""

self improvement: first order is ""i need more discipline."" second order is ""what environment makes discipline unnecessary? what systems can i build so good choices become automatic?""

 why this changes everything

your brain is wired for immediate survival, not long term strategy. we evolved to avoid the tiger, not plan five career moves ahead. this is why crash diets fail. why new year resolutions die by february. why people stay stuck in cycles they hate.

the magic happens when you start asking better questions:

before making any decision, literally ask yourself ""and then what?"" three times minimum. sounds simple but most people never do this once.

scenario: you're thinking about quitting your job.

first order: ""i hate my job, i should quit.""

second order: ""if i quit, what happens to my income? my routine? my identity? what fills that void?""

third order: ""how will that financial stress impact my relationships? my mental health? my ability to find something better?""

suddenly you're not just reacting. you're strategizing.

 how to actually use this

start with small decisions. you're about to scroll instagram. first order: ""i'm bored, let me check my phone."" second order: ""if i open instagram now, i'll lose 30 minutes. then i'll feel worse about not doing the thing i actually need to do. that guilt will make me avoid it more.""

boom. you just hacked your own behavior.

Dan Koe talks about this constantly in his work on one person businesses. he doesn't just say ""start a business."" he asks what kind of life you actually want, what skills serve multiple goals, what systems let you work less while earning more. that's second order thinking applied to entrepreneurship.

for building anything meaningful, use what strategists call ""inversion."" instead of asking ""how do i succeed?"" ask ""how would i guarantee failure?"" then avoid those things religiously.

wanna fail at fitness? skip workouts randomly. eat like shit when stressed. never track anything. now invert it. show up consistently even if it's 10 minutes. have default healthy meals ready. track one simple metric.

 resources that actually teach this

Thinking in Bets by Annie Duke. this book is insanely good for decision making under uncertainty. Duke is a former poker champion turned decision strategist. she teaches you to think in probabilities instead of certainties. the section on resulting (judging decisions by outcomes instead of process) will make you question everything you think you know about success. plus her stories from high stakes poker tables are wild. best book i've read on practical strategic thinking.

The Great Mental Models series by Shane Parrish. Parrish runs Farnam Street, one of the best newsletters on thinking better. these books break down mental models used by strategists across fields. volume one covers first principles thinking and circle of competence. beautifully written, packed with examples from history and business. this is the ultimate toolkit for upgrading how your brain processes information.

for daily practice, there's this app called Stoic that sends you prompts for reflective thinking. it's basically a guided journal that forces you to think through decisions systematically. helped me catch so many autopilot patterns i didn't realize i had. the evening reflection feature specifically makes you analyze ""what did i do today and what were the actual consequences?""

Naval Ravikant's podcast appearances are gold for this too. he thinks in frameworks and principles, not tactics. his episode on The Knowledge Project about decision making and the one on Joe Rogan about leverage will rewire your brain. completely free on spotify or youtube.

 the real shift

strategic thinking isn't about being smarter. it's about being more aware of cause and effect. most people see events as isolated. strategic people see chains of consequences.

you start noticing patterns everywhere. why that friend always has drama (they reward it with attention). why you're tired all the time (you scroll before bed, tank your sleep quality, wake up groggy, need coffee, crash by 3pm, repeat). why some businesses scale while others stay stuck (systems vs hustle).

the compounding effect is absurd. one good decision leads to better options tomorrow. one strategic framework applied consistently beats years of random effort.

your brain will resist this initially because it requires pausing. we're addicted to action and immediate gratification. sitting with a decision for an extra minute feels uncomfortable. do it anyway.

start today with one decision. before you make it, ask ""and then what"" three times. write down the chain of consequences. see what shifts.

you can't unsee this once you learn it. suddenly everyone around you looks like they're playing checkers while you're seeing the chess board. not in an arrogant way, just in a ""oh shit i was doing the same thing last month"" way.

this is how you stop being reactive and start being strategic. this is how you design a life instead of just surviving one.",2,1767269134.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False

1q12qw3,https://v.redd.it/ybdupadb9qag1,"Holy shit, Higgsfield is INSANE - Made this ""Trapped in AI"" interview series and I'm blown away 🤯","Okay so I've been experimenting with Higgsfield and this tool is absolutely MENTAL.

I created this short film concept where 7 different people from different eras/cultures answer: ""If you were trapped in AI, would you even know your world is simulated?""

Each character gets a 5-second portrait shot with lip-synced dialogue. The results are honestly unsettling in the best way possible.

Here are the prompts I used (one example):

**Character: 1970s Neapolitan Intellectual**

*Image prompt:* Close-up portrait of a 35-year-old Italian woman intellectual in 1970s Naples. Deep brown curly hair loosely pinned up, thin-framed glasses, a lit cigarette held between fingers near her face. Sharp, tired eyes gazing directly at camera with intense contemplation. Dark turtleneck sweater, minimal jewelry. Cinematic side lighting creating dramatic shadows across half her face. Blurred bookshelf background. Shot on 35mm film, warm color grading with slight grain. Vertical 9:16 format.

*Video prompt:* Close-up of Italian woman speaking: ""Perhaps reality was never the problem... the question is why we need it."" She slowly takes a drag from her cigarette while speaking the first part, pauses, exhales smoke to the side. Her eyes shift from looking down in thought to directly at camera. Slight head tilt. Soft side lighting remains constant. Contemplative mood. Neutral desaturated color grading.



**Other characters include:**

* Hong Kong stockbroker (2000s)
* Beijing product manager (2010s)
* Shanghai barista (2020s)
* Tokyo office worker (1990s)
* Berlin architect (1960s)
* Silicon Valley engineer (2010s)

Full prompt document is too long for one post but DM me if you want the complete breakdown!

The lip sync is chef's kiss 👌 and the fact that you can control micro-expressions with detailed prompts is game-changing.

Made this philosophical short film with Higgsfield and I'm genuinely blown away by what's possible now.

**The concept:** 7 people from different eras/cultures answer one question:  
*""If you were trapped in AI, would you even know your world is simulated?""*

Each character gets a 5-second cinematic close-up with perfectly lip-synced dialogue in their native language. The results are hauntingly good.

I wish it was a troll post but it's not.

Last night, me and my wife celebrated the new year. We had some wine and decided to go to bed and opened the phone gallery to see some memories from 2025. I opened gallery from my phone and gave the phone to her, so she started scrolling. (Mind you that I have over 6000 photos on my gallery because my phone stores every photo on messaging apps automatically.) There is nothing special on my gallery. Lots of pictures of her, cats, some scenery, utility numbers, some screenshots, some photos of my car etc. Really nothing special.

She saw a picture of a woman. (She is dressed and laying down on a hammock), what seems to be somewhere in Indonesia based on the trees and scenery.) I live close to EU and never been to Asia. This picture was sent to our friends group chat on WhatsApp back in 2024, by a friend who visited Indonesia, and he said something like: ""I think I'll meet this woman today for coffee. Wish me luck"" on our friends group chat. And that's pretty much it. He didn't text me privately, it was posted on a WhatsApp group, I don't know who this woman is, her picture definitely shows a region not close to me (rice fields etc, I live in EU) and she seems to be just a normal woman. There is no nutidy, nothing naked, just a classic photo for Instagram.

My wife asked me who this woman is and I said ""I think it was my friend wanted to date her in Indonesia a few years ago."" She didn't believe me. She started asking why her picture is on my phone. I said probably WhatsApp auto downloaded it? (It really does) She started accusing me of cheating on her. I opened WhatsApp, found the group chat from 2 years ago, showed her the whole WhatsApp messages from that time. She knows the friend who posted it, she read the messages from that time, but somehow she still doesn't believe me and thinks that I'm cheating with her.

I told her that I never saw this woman in my life, I've never been to Asia in my life, how I can cheat? And she keeps accusing me that ""You saved her photo to your phone so it means you were interested in her!"" I didn't save anyone's photo, phone takes attachments on WhatsApp on my gallery.

I told her to not accuse me of something like cheating without any proof. Like seriously? Some guy posted a photo 2 years ago on a WhatsApp group and I'm cheating??? This is the evidence? She started to fight with me over this. ""Looks like in new year you already made decision to have another woman in your life"" and things like that.

I left home to calm myself down. Now she is calling me and telling me things like ""I left her as usual"" ""I'm very emotional like a pink rabbit"" ""She knew that I would cheat"" ""It's good I didn't have kids with you.""

I confronted her that I'm not cheating, never cheated in my life, didn't cheat on her but she is behaving like a child right now and damaging our marriage. She started blaming me that I'm not reliable, trustable, she knew it etc. I gave her a last ultimatum that either she needs to get some therapy or apologize for accusing me as cheater or I'm going to divorce her because I can't tolerate being accused like this. She said that I should be the one to apologise for keeping other women's picture on my phone.

I'm speechless at this point. This is very childish, but she says that she won't apologize and we can divorce if needed.

Some discussion was on IM with her so I took screenshots just to be safe in case she will lie again, at least I have something to show other people if we'll divorce...

Seriously, I don't know what's going on. I feel like she is the one cheating, projecting her behaviour to me but seriously, this behaviour is non stop and I'm very tired of it.

I don't know what to do. One day she is a nice person, another day she looks at me like I'm some evil and she doesn't admit that she has issues and needs therapy. How can you call your partner for a random photo?

I’ve been building **Starship Java Tycoon**, a throwback to those old-school Flash games like Coffee Tycoon. It’s a simple 2D management sim where you run a cafe on a starship. No complex 3D graphics or massive logistics—just a straightforward loop of managing resources and watching numbers go up.

I built this because I missed the ""small expectations"" vibe of early 2000s web games. It's fully playable, and I'd love to get some feedback from this community. Keep in mind, it's a very simple game (on purpose).

You can grab a **free copy** using the code **FREECOFFEE** at checkout.

**Memory Transcription Subject: Edward Hamilton, Human Colonist**

Date \[*standardized human time\]:* January 6, 2161

 

“You said that this wouldn’t take long.”

“I did.”

“Then why am I still sitting here with tinfoil on my head?”

“To let the stuff sets properly, besides you’re the one that didn’t want the quickest one.”

“Excuse me for not wanting my hair to be hot pink.”

I grumbled at the state of myself, sitting in a lounge with tinfoil on my head like one of those stereotype paranoiacs. Every time I forget it’s there I get reminded with the rustle of tinfoil each time I moved.

“It shouldn’t be too long now anyway, just another hour or so should do it.”

“Another hour?” I tried to hide my disheartened voice but to no avail.

“Stop being a whiny brat and sit up.”

I could see she liked this so I decided to play along, crossing my arms like a kid would and huffed exaggeratedly earning a small smirk from her.

“Guess I’m missing the movie at this rate.” I said it more to myself, but Willow must have heard.

“What movie?”

“The sector I’m with are doing a movie tonight, nothing too much but it is what it is like.”

She gave me this weird look at my nonchalant remark before asking.

“So, what’s up with you recently?”

“Not much, just trying to get back home.” I feigned boredom and tried not to think of what happened last night.

“No, I mean with you?” She emphasised. “You’ve changed a lot since the last time I saw you, before I heard you went to Avor then nothing for the past few months?”

The question took me back for a brief moment, how do I even explain this, just say that I have trauma now, can’t really behave normally around people without thinking they have ulterior motives?

“Oh, you know, just been quiet is all.” I tried to play it off and drink my coffee and stared out into the artificial environment the ships window had set.

“Edward, I’m being serious. Last I heard about you from our friends was that you left for Avor after Daniel… You know.” She looked sad at that remark before continuing. “Then next thing I know is that the news is saying that you uncovered an underground Obor fighting arena out in the middle of nowhere.”

“Yeah, it… Um wasn’t fun to see that.”

I knew the story the Avor government decided to go with, painting us as heroes that were able to get rid of the corruption. It was different in real life, it was so much worse… I shook my head trying to refocus on everything else, I don’t want to focus on that, I just can’t think about it right now.

The urge to get up and just leave just to not be asked about it passed by my mind and I debated it.

“Then after that, months later we find out you’ve been living in the old settlement because a krev kept visiting you there, like what was that about?”

I grabbed the cup in front of me and deliberately drank it as loudly as I could, it was either that or slam the palm into the table to try and get her to stop asking about what happened to me. It was rude and I hated it, but I couldn’t keep thinking about it.

“I’m sorry Will, some things happened there and I don’t want to talk about it alright.”

I don’t like being like this, I hated it, I hated everything about myself, everything happened because I couldn’t fight them off good enough and now this all of this.

*‘Daniel would have been better here than me.’*

I felt her hand garb my own, I followed the appendage up as she stared at me with not anger but what I could tell was worry.

“Edward we’re worried about you, all of us. We’re your friends and after what happened to Daniel you cut everyone out, everyone has a different story of what happened, some saying you wanted to get away from it all, that you wanted to get out of the hole in the ground that was home.”

“What do you think happened?” I asked lowly trying my best to keep my voice straight.

She took a moment before replying.

“You’re running from something, something that happened even before the mine collapse, it just showed more when it happened.”

I tore my gaze away from her, I just couldn’t look anymore. It was like staring the truth in the face and telling it it’s not true. It just couldn’t work. Was I really that bad? Is this how people see me now adays, as some sort of kid still mourning his mother.

“Wha- what makes you think that?”

“Edward, we’ve known each other since we were kids, we’ve fallen in and out of love. I bet I know more about you than you do about yourself, I know for a fact that you hide behind a thin barrier of bravado, but inside you’re just hurting.”

I think she just got one, probably from the times I’ve changed when no one was looking or when I thought no one would see me like this. I guess I’ve gotten worse at hiding my feelings.

It was one of the reasons why we ended things, I just wasn’t open enough about my feelings, maybe things haven’t changed that much.

I let go of the hand and wrapped my own around my coffee and choked it down, it felt like my throat was in a vice.

“There’s just some things I’m not ready to talk about Will, I just… Some things happened on Avor that I can’t talk about.”

“I know Ed, just know that I’m here if you ever do want to talk about it. Everyone has problems and they can work through it their own way, talking is probably the best but everyone is different.”

I sat back again mulling over what she said, and what everyone else says. That talking through it is the best way of dealing with these things, but why does it hurt so much when I do or when someone brings it up.

“At least tell me you’re going to Earth to get help?” She asked finishing the rest of her own drink in the process.

“…I am, I’m going to see if I can get a therapist and if my dad’s still around.”

“That’s good Edward, that’s good. The first step is always admitting you have a problem, everything else is a step in a good direction and it’ll get easier as you go.”

I keep hearing that from everyone I speak to, and they all say the same thing. Maybe I should say to her, at least a little of what happened then, see if I can get better.

I uncapped my hand and held hers looking into her eyes before I spoke.

“Will, the trip to Avor, it’s not what the news says it was…” I took a shuddering breath thankful that the café was almost empty because I knew I could break at any point doing this like with Sarah.

She gave me a look to continue.

“It was fine at first but everything went wrong when we got to Bulik, I was drugged…”

I had to stop for a moment, I could see it in my head clear as it happened, even the smell was still there of chemicals that hurt my throat and made my lungs feel empty.

“I-ii-“ She draped another hand over my own, she squeezed gently with a look that spoek that I should continue.

“I… I was taken and… I was, I was going to be turned into a pet for those sadistic bastards… The-th-they treated me like I was an animal, just something that couldn’t feel or think higher, they-they…”

“Shhhhh.” I heard her say and squeezed my hand, a hand I could still feel pliers digging under the nails, I squeezed back to try and get rid of the feeling but it wouldn’t go away. I knew what was going to happen next, that the feeling of my teeth going next.

“It’s alright Edward, it’s alright, just take it slowly and breath. There’s no rush, no one is going to hurt you here.”

I felt wetness around my eyes as I described what happened to me to, how I was knocked out afterward. I could barely even finish my sentences the way my breath shuddered. I needed to be somewhere else, I needed to do something else to take the thoughts away I couldn’t do this anymore, but the hand on my own kept me rooted to the seat.

Some things I didn’t mention, about what I planned to do when I got back to Tellus, about not being able to sleep, not be able to do anything. I just wanted to go back to my room and lie down.

It took a while before I calmed down again, rubbing at my eyes and calming my breathing. I didn’t speak for a long time just getting my thoughts in order, trying not to cry, to just get up and walk away from all this.

Willow just stayed there holding my hand reassuringly offering a squeeze.

“I can see why you hid away now, Edward why’d you not tell anyone?”

“I… I don’t know, I didn’t want to burden anyone with it.”

“Look your not a burden, what you went through would make anyone not want to see the light if day again, and the fact that you still hang around the Krev means there is something in there that isn’t hurting.”

“I can’t stay around them much, only the ones I know, everyone else…”

“I see why you stayed underground, but you can get better, I know you can, if you ever need to talk to someone, just give me or our friends a call, we’re here for you like you are for the rest of us.”

“Thank you, I just, I can’t talk about it.”

“You telling me and whoever else is a step in the right direction, I just can’t believe the Krev would actually stop that low on someone, no wonder the Avor news covered it up.”

“Look, please don’t tell anyone else about it, it’s not just me but Micheal had to sign a NDA, they could take everything from him.”

“I wasn’t planning to, I-“ She was cut off by a beeping noise she checked her watch before getting up and moving to my side. “About time to take this thing off.” She started peeling away the makeshift hat I was wearing and spoke.

“Edward, I’m serious, if there is anything you need or if you just need to talk to someone about anything you can talk to me. There’s a few of us here I think, I ran into John and Caleb, not sure about the Tony or Elizabeth.”

“I see, thank you again.”

“No problem here.” She sat back down and grabbed a mirror out of her bag handing it to me.

I held it up and my heart sank a little at what was staring back, the puffy red eyes were there and the worn look but now there was a mop of black and white hair on top. I moved the mirror around to see the rest and smoothed out the hair to test what it looks like but came to a conclusion.

*‘It looks alright, not bad and not good either just different.’*

“So, what do you think?” I pondered how best to answer her and was thankful that it wasn’t about what happened to me.

“It’s alright, I thought it was going to be blonde highlights or something like that.”

“I said that it was going to be bleached, I think it turned out well.”

I could see the natural colour and the bleached bits at the same time, she was right when she said mixed and it was sort of growing on me, I guessed when I washed, the vibrancy of the white would go down a bit.

I was taken out of my thoughts by someone striking my arm shoving me over in the seat closer to the window. My heart rate rocketed when it happened until I realised who it was.

“John?”

“The one and only you f\*cking ghost.” He pointed a finger at my chest and put another arm around my neck in an overly friendly greeting. “How have you been, felt like ages since I’ve seen you?” He glanced over at Willow and I could already tell what was about to happen when his face went ‘oh’

“So you two-“

“Nope.” I answered moving his arm from around my neck.

“C’mon John act civil.” Another familiar face joined us.”

“Caleb.” I addressed him.

*‘Speak of the devil’*

“How you keeping Eddy?”

“Been better how’re you two?”

“Woah slow down there, all work no play? Look we haven’t seen you in months and this is how you act, all professional? I couldn’t believe it when Caleb said you were in here.” He said while getting even closer pretty much taking up the two seats to himself, I could tell he was joking with me, it was nice to see the both them haven’t changed.

“But in all seriousness how are you doing Edward, you keeping out of trouble? not ended up with any missing teeth yet or maybe a broken bottle stuck in your head?”

He didn’t realise how close he was to the actual truth with that one. I pushed him back over to his own seat and pushed a little more almost toppling him out of his seat. He grinned back at me for it and I did too, a little anyway.

*‘It was nice to revel in their sort of madness, a good distraction from what me and willow were talking about earlier.’*

“I’ve been good, been getting more exercise lately.”

“Oh, have you know?” John decided to start poking at me, before I started to actually push him out of his chair.

“That’s good to hear, what have you been up to lately we haven’t seen you in so long?” Caleb asked this time being the normal one out of the pair.

“Nothing much, I’ve just been… around I guess, there’s not much to talk about.” I said not wanting to say I’ve been living in a rut for a while.

“See I told you, he’s smuggling drugs, he can’t talk about it, or the cartel will get him.” John said getting up from the floor.

“wait wait wait, what?” Willow asked John trying to find reason his madness.

“That’s why he disappeared, he’s been doing cartel hits all over Avor, see Caleb I was right this entire time.” He said with pride in his voice like the true narcissist he was.

“You have never said this to me before at all.” Caleb said back in a dead pan tone.

“What’re you guys doing here anyway?” I asked wanting to move the conversation along a bit.

“Same as you, going home, see family probably get booted back to Tellus in the few hours when we get there.” John said while Caleb nodded along.

“Pretty much the same thing, see home for a few days and go back to Tellus if possible.” He said.

“How are finding the ship, it’s unbearably boring.” John bemoaned dramatically.

“It’s only been four days.”

“Yeah, four boring days, there’s nothing to do around here.”

“This is literally a cruise ship in space, what are you talking about there’s plenty of things to do.” Willow said.

“Yeah plenty of boring things to do, where’s the fun in it, it’s just being active and nothing else really.”

“Well, I might have something I’m working on.”

“Oh do tell or else I’m liable to go and fist fight the captain just to have some sort of excitement.”

“There’s a gym between sector E and F, it has a fighting ring and since I’m traveling with the krev I had this idea.” As I spoke, he leaned in contemplating what I was saying, getting closer each time until I had to push him away again.

 “Well, I’m going to see if I can get enough of the pairs involved to see if I can start a fighting tournament, sort of like a betting ring to since why not. Anyone can fight in the ring but I assume the krev would rather bet on their partner to win and we’d set it up in a tournament type of way, just a bit of fun really.”

John snaked and arm around my head again and pointed and spoke to Caleb.

“See this, this is what I’m talking about, starting fight clubs and underground betting rings.” He turned to face me, “Where have you been this entire time, I’m in, what are you calling this little fight club?”

“Enterprise fight night.”

“Ohh I like that now. You better have my name down for it, this is the sort of fun I like.”

Willow scoffed at the remark when my pad chimed, John realised my head as I tapped him on the elbow, intentionally hitting a knuckle against the funny bone for all the grabbing. He cursed me out and I just smiled back at him.

**Bre: Where are you the movie’s half way finished.**

**Ed: Taking longer than expected, I’ll be back soon.**

I checked the time on the pad and realised that I should probably get Flin some food and then head back to sector E.

“Hey, I’m gonna need to get going here, but I’ll text you if I can get enough people for the Enterprise thing.” I said pushing John out of the way, interrupting his conversation about having a red carpet laid out for him at the ring.

“What’s the rush, girlfriend want you back so badly?”

“Nah, just some errands to take care of, again thank you for the doing my hair like this.”

“Am I going to regret doing this for you?” Willow asked.

“No, but it is sort of growing on me a little bit, alright gotta run, see you guys later.”

I started my way through the ship again, this time stopping in Sector C to see if I can get a plate of food like last time, finding that they were almost ready to shut shop for the night.

With a platter of food and a weird look from the staffers manning the kitchen I started my way through the corridors toward where Flin was seeing nothing out of the ordinary, just people going about their nightly routine, the movie must have been long over by the time I got to sector F.

It was weird seeing this side of the ship, I knew it wasn’t suppose to be overly big, but the amount of corridors and different places was astonishing. Some of it was same-ish, but there were a few other things I saw when I was walking.

What really stood out was a sign for something about 0G, I was thinking it must have been one of those drop and fall type elevators, but realising I was in space, it could actually be 0G.

*‘I’ll have to see about this later with the others.’*

It was nice I didn’t really think of anything and it was a welcome difference, I wasn’t mulling over every single thing for once and just walked.

Making my way through the last corridor I came to stop hearing voices down the corridor to the vent entrance. I peaked my head around and saw that there was about five or six security guards looking in the alcove pointing a flashlight down the vent entrance.

Backing around the corner I felt my heart pounding in my chest, my legs felt like jelly, and I pressed my back against the wall. They were there, in the little alcove looking into the vent where Flin was.

‘What do I do now? They know where he is… or maybe they don’t.’

Peaking around the corner again, I saw that they were talking amongst themselves, about six of them four Reskets, one Trombil and a Krev among them. They were wearing the security gear I saw the other Resket wearing, one peered my way and I ducked down the corridor again.

I needed to move, I have to get rid of the plate of meat I’m holding right now, and get away from this as fast as possible, but what about Flin, did they have him or did he manage to get away into another vent system. In the state he was in I don’t think he could have.

I back tracked and found a trash can and dumped the plate into it and started walking back the way to Sector E not wanting to bring any attention to myself.

‘How did they find him? Was it the camera maybe it could have been me or Cruth this morning because of cameras?’

My head spun with ideas and rebuttals, if it was us this morning why would Breeve be able to contact me, she’d be texting to stay away or security would have caught me immediately if they found out we were involved.

The anxiety in my head grew as I made it back to sector E, there wasn’t anything I could do right now except see if Breeve and Cruth were alright. The thoughts of earlier talking to Willow fell away being replaced by my worry for Breeve and Cruth, so I increased my walking speed to get back quicker.

outgrows them within months, wears through the soles from constant running and playing, and

childs shoes is just an ongoing expense, but I did not expect it to be this frustrating.

Pentagram City was now in ruins and the TV-tower destroyed.

Rage build up inside her heart. But instead of showing any signs of anger or sadness, her face was void of any emotions.

„Nawwww, poor little girl. It seems you are late. Don't worry though, they are still alive. I wouldn't kill you without a wholesome reunion. You need each other after all.“ said Alastor in a mocking voice.

„You blather a lot since you are on your dumb power-trip, you fucking lunatic. Seriously, if you had ignore my partners, I wouldn't have cared about what stupid stuff you do. But now you have crossed a line!“

„Oh? And what could you possibly do against this? Now WHERE I AM ALL POWERFUL AND LIKE THIS?!!!“ said Alastor and transformed instantly in a grotesk Wendigo-like entity, trying to induce terror in this petite woman. But instead...

„Pfff! Hehehehehehe, hahahahahahahahaha, HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!“ she laughed as if this was the best joke of her life.  
„Oh? Y-y-you mean this seriously? You really thought that would scare me? ME?! Listen you stupid deer, you are not the only one with some fancy magic. Because I CAN DO THE SAME SHIT AS WELL!!!“ as if to mock him she used her magic to imitate his appearance.

„You will regret this!“ said Alastor in a half furious, half irritated voice.

„We will see.“  
And with these words, the battle between the witch and the strongest Sinner in Hell, begun.  
Alastor tried to pierce her with his shadow tentacles he summoned from his shadow but Velvette sliced those effortlessly.  
Next he tried one of his curses but Velvette was prepared and repelled his voodoo curse.  
Spells clashed against each other, punches got exchanged on each side, and with each attack, the ground trembled and shaked.

„You're more resilient than I thought.“ said Alastor.

„I don't care.“ respondet Velvette in turn. In fact, keeping up with him was a difficult act for her. The only reason why she was still conscious was because of her witchcraft and the additional power she received through the support of her viewers.

„Still, it seems you are struggling. For being able to entertain me for so long I will...“ BANG!!

A magic bullet almost pierced through Alastor's forhead. Almost, as Alastor reacted in time to block it.

„That's it! I will tear your soul out off your miserable body and then making it a part of my radio broadcast!“

Instead of a response a halberd flew against Alastor, slaying all shadow tentacles and minions he summoned.

Then she shot several times with a magical gun which she created by her magic.

Sweat dropped from Alastor's face. It seems he had underestimated her. Like him, she was abnormal. He didn't know why, and he had also not the time to waste a thought about this. Instead he decided to fight now seriously and unleashed his full power.

„Dammit! It seems I have to fight seriously too. Shit!“ and so, Velvette finally decided to make full use of her power and begun to transform.  
Small horns grew from her head, her teeth turned sharper, her eyes glowed in a dark-pinkish colour, her skin was more metallic, bat-like wings spread from her back, a devilish looking tail appeared and her hair radiated in a darkish fire-red tone. Finally she was dressed in a witch outfit. She wore a pitch-black pointed hat, a black coat covered in emojis and occult sigils, black leather trousers with a black belt and black boots.

Then suddenly, weird, angry-looking emojis appeared over the heads of the unconscious Overlords and Sinners. Then they opened their eyes but this time they ejected a burning pinkish-red light. A pentagram with a heart on its centre appeared on the forehead of each Sinner and Overlord. Then after a loud, terrifying warcry they all attacked Alastor at once. However, Alastor beat them easily all at once, knocking them out again.

„See! That's the difference between you and I! You and your stupid partners are weak! Pathetic! You always rely on others over and over again. Me, though? I have absolute power!“ taunted Alastor.

„Big talk for someone who had to buy his own power to become a big-shot in Hell.“ shouted Velvette back.

„How....-?!“

„Oh please, eventually it would have been discovered anyway. Especially from someone like me and my partners.“ shouted back and shot again. This time successfully though. A big hole appeared where Velvette's bullet hit Alastor's right shoulder.

In the same time however, one of Alastor minions managed it to stab in Velvette neck before it was instantly killed by one of Velvette's summoned knifes.

„Argh, FUCK!“ cursed Velvette and healed her wound.

Then out of nowhere, Alastor appeared and kicked her away. Simultaneously, Velvette blocked it with a barrier and stopped herself in the air with her wings.

Immediately she summoned several lightning bolts and threw them against him.

One of them managed it to hit Alastor and electrify him.

He panted from the shock.

„I'm not done with you, you stupid deer. You ruined my day a lot. I won't kill you. You owe me too much debt for all the damage you have caused! As soon as this is over, you will become my labor-slave!“

„Then bring it on!“

Then something...unusual happened. The atmosphere changed again and the air felt far more tense than ever before.

Then two pentagrams appeared, one on the ground and one on the sky, so great that it seemed as if they enclosed the whole Pride Ring.  
The sky became darker and more power flowed through Velvette's body.

The power she received this time was a result of her live-stream. The whole time she filmed everything and everyone watched it. The more time passed, the more likes and upvotes she accumulated. Even some of the Deadly Sins gave a like. Some did it out of curiousity, others out of boredom. And with each support Velvette became more threatening.

„You're cancelled!“ and with these words, Velvette triggered her ultimate attack and unleashed a gigantic pillar of energy on Alastor.

Alastor tried to block it with all his power but it was in vain.  
His body was burned and electrified. He was exhausted and tired. Everything felt numb.

A pentagram appeared again but this time on Alastor's staff. It seemed as if Velvette sealed the power which came from it.

She landed smoothly on the ground and approached him.

„You have two options now.“ she begun „Either you become my labor-slave until you have paid up all the damage you have caused on the business from me and my partners or...“ she grabbed him by the hair and pulled him forcefully to her until looked into each others eyes. „...*you*will end up as the first soul in*my*broadcast. And believe me, now where I am like this I can do*so much*worse than you could ever do.“

Alastor was furious and frustrated. Why did he lose? He couldn't comprehend it, couldn't understand it. All what he knew was, that it would be better to accept her deal since a part of him could feel instinctively that this woman in front of him wasn't a mere stupid brat. She was a calculative and manipulative predator and a business woman. He could instinctively feel that her threat weren't just empty words.

„Well?“ the woman asked him.

„D-d-d...“ Alastor stuttered. Then he took deep breath and pressed a „Deal.“ out of his mouth. And with this one word he became a slave. Again.  
Several sigils and pentagrams appeared on the spot where they were and as if to further mock him, a big hand-shake-emoji appeared above them which concluded the deal with one move.

A black chocker with a heart on its centre appeared on his neck. A reminder of his current status.  
He was raging inside. Yet, in the same time he developed a kind of respect toward this woman. He knew however that she would give a damn about.

„Very well. Now, help me to clear this mess!“ she ordered.

Reluctantly, Alastor followed her command.

„Urgh...what the fuck did just happen?“ groaned Valentino.

„I feel like shit.“ said Vox.  
The other Overlords also woke slowly up.

„I really hate it to play the babysitter. Anyway, you two! Help me to fix this mess!“ barked Velvette.

„It seems....I owe you something.“ said Carmilla in a slightly bitter voice.

„Yeah, yeah! I don't care! If you want to be useful help me to remove all this rubble.“ answered Velvette annoyed.

She had no time for all this emotional talk. „Dammit Melissa! Shit! Fuck!“.

After some time they finally managed it to remove all the stones and rubble, and retrieved Melissa.

„Seems you also have someone you lo...-“ a blade suddenly appeared close on Carmilla's throat.

„Say it and I slice you in several pieces. Old woman!“

„...“

„Good.“

Silently they treated the wounded and repaired as much as they could together with the other conscious Overlords and Sinners.



1 year later



Velvette woke up. On the right side was her assistant Melissa.

„Melissa. Wake up. We have stuff to do.“ said Velvette, moved out of her bed and grabbed Melissa's hand to take a shower with her.

After they were done, they dressed up and prepared themself for the day.

Melissa checked the news, „It seems nothing bad has happened so far.“

„Of course not. Now where all these damn conflicts, wars, battles, whatever-things are over, we could finally recover enough to end up on top again.“

Melissa handed Velvette a cup of coffee over.

After checking the news and empty her cup, they went together in Velvette's studio where they met Alastor who was surrounded and dressed up by several subordinates of Velvette.

„Alastor, as punctual as always.“ said Velvette.

„Hmpf!“ answered Alastor in turn. Even though he smiled, it was clear as day that he was annoyed about his current situation.

The only thing that made it bearable for him was that he would get treated with some gossip-talk about Vox after the work was done.

The first day as one of Velvette's laborers were horrifying. He got humiliated, treated like a doll and had to wear – from his point of view - the silliest outfits.

Of course, Rosie, his former mistress, wouldn't missed this chance to witness it. She entered the studio and then laughed so hard when she saw Alastor in a marine-blue suit with a black top hat and cherri-red dance shoes.

She then observed the switch to other outfits for one hour or so until she ordered in a good around a thousand of Velvette's newest creation and payed an extra summ just as a thanks for watching this show.

He still became angry when he just thought about that.

Meanwhile though, he learned to bear it and become content with his fate. He actually even enjoyed it sometimes and it was especially fun to scare the other employees sometimes a little bit.

„Alright, time to go to the stage. Afterwards you have to promote the other products as well.“ said Velvette in a dry, indifferent voice.

A lot had changed since her battle with Alastor. Many Sinners found redemption, even Vox, Val retreated from VoxTek as well after Angel ascended too and Hell came overall a bit more peaceful. Meanwhile, Velvette thrived in this new environment and became even famous outside of the Pride Ring.  
Thanks to a deal she made with Heaven and Lucifer, she was even able to sell her clothes in both, Heaven and Hell. Though, in Heaven it came with certain conditions and rules but Velvette accept them anyway as business was business to her.  
If she had to follow some guidelines, so be it.

In any case, her life had changed. She even was even now in a genuine relationship with Melissa although she never would have admitted that openly.

And while her friends went their own seperated ways, they still stayed regulary in contact with video-chats and other form of media.

She was also of course cautious with Alastor, but the summ he had to pay off was enormous and would likely take hundreds or even thousands of years until the deal was fulfilled. And this time, there was no way out. No loophole that could be exploited.

He would stay her labor-slave for a long, long time. And he would learn to love it!

When the day was over, both, Velvette and Melissa finished their work and would walk together to their home and enjoy the night together.",1,1767268617.0,velissa,1,1.0,False

So I don't need anything. Just decided to post here cause posting on reddit has helped me stop smoking and vaping a year ago. 

I suffer (mainly) from ADHD and a mood disorder (long story). Eversince trialing a mood stabilizer anti-psychotic, coffee has become anxiety inducing. The mood stabilizer is helping tremendously after years of treatment-resistance so I have to give up on coffee/cafeine. 

Also my sleep is absolutely trash and nothing I do helps. Very fragmented. I feel like it's getting better these last few days though. 

I need to stop coffee to see if it helps my meds work better and makes my mental health disorders more manageable (directly or indirecty through better sleep). 

Also, I want to get rid of the ups and downs caused by coffee. I hate it. I want more even days energy and mood-wise. 

Plus I need the caffeine variable gone, so I can assess my mental health more objectively. That's the main reason I stopped smoking a year ago and that's also a big reason I'm stopping caffeine.

I am using a new anonymous account simply to keep some privacy while posting here. Nothing more to it than that.

I am a 32 year old guy based in East London, South Africa, and I do not mind traveling. I live an active, structured life and value calm presence, honesty, and clear communication. I train regularly, work a lot, and generally prefer depth and steadiness over noise or performance.

Physically, I am tall at 1.83, athletic and solid rather than lean. I gym five to six times a week and take care of myself. I am growing my hair out a bit and have a beard. I am happy to share a photo once there is mutual interest and a sense that we are on the same page.

I am here because I am open to real chemistry and physical closeness, approached with respect and consent. I am not looking to rush into a relationship, but I am also not interested in empty or careless encounters. I value mutual attraction, presence, and being able to feel relaxed and human together.

I tend to be intellectual and thoughtful, understated and calm. I appreciate emotional maturity, kindness, and people who are comfortable being themselves. I am open to taking things slowly, meeting for a coffee or a walk, and seeing whether there is an easy connection and attraction in person.

If you are between 25 and 40, value honesty and boundaries, and are open to exploring connection without pressure, feel free to reach out with a bit about yourself and what you are looking for. We can chat and see if meeting makes sense.",2,1767268461.0,r4rSA,0,1.0,False

I've been studying psychology, productivity systems, and human behavior for years now through books, research papers, and podcasts. And honestly? Most advice about getting unstuck is complete garbage. 

Here's what nobody wants to hear: being stuck isn't always about lacking motivation or discipline. Sometimes your brain literally can't see a way forward because you've trained it to operate within the same tired loops. The system isn't broken, you're just running outdated software.

But there's a weird strategy that actually works. It's uncomfortable as hell, and most people won't do it because it requires temporarily making things worse before they get better.

## 1. Deliberately break your patterns (even the  productive  ones)

Your brain loves patterns. That's the problem. When you're stuck, you're basically running the same mental program expecting different results. 

The solution? Interrupt everything. And I mean everything.

Change your morning routine completely. If you wake up at 6am, try 9am. If you work from your desk, work from a coffee shop. If you meal prep on Sundays, wing it for two weeks. Your gym routine? Switch it entirely or take a break.

This sounds counterproductive because we're told consistency is king. But when you're genuinely stuck, consistency is just drilling deeper into the same hole.

James Clear talks about this in Atomic Habits (bestseller, over 15 million copies sold, basically the modern bible of behavior change). He explains how identity change requires evidence that contradicts your current self image. You can't think your way into a new identity. You have to act your way into it. And sometimes that means burning down the old patterns first, even the ones that used to serve you.

This book will make you question everything you think you know about habit formation. It's not about willpower or motivation, it's about engineering your environment and identity. Insanely good read if you're serious about actual change.

## 2. Embrace strategic incompetence

Here's the dangerous part: stop being good at things that keep you stuck.

If you're amazing at your job but miserable, start doing the bare minimum. Not forever, just long enough to create space for something else. If you're the friend everyone vents to but nobody shows up for, stop being available 24/7.

This feels wrong because society rewards competence and reliability. But sometimes being  good  at the wrong things is exactly what's trapping you.

Cal Newport explores this in Deep Work (Georgetown professor, multiple bestsellers, basically invented the concept of focused productivity for the digital age). He argues that not all work is created equal. Some tasks keep you busy but don't move you forward. And often, we become incredibly skilled at busywork because it's easier than confronting what actually matters.

The book is a comprehensive guide to reclaiming your attention and doing work that actually counts. Newport doesn't sugarcoat it: becoming valuable in the modern economy requires the ability to do hard things, and that means cutting out the easy stuff you're good at.

## 3. Create artificial urgency through public commitment

Your brain doesn't take vague plans seriously. It needs stakes.

Tell people what you're doing. Not in a casual  yeah I'm thinking about starting a business  way. Actually commit. Post on social media. Tell your family at dinner. Better yet, put money on it.

Use an app like Stickk or Beeminder. These platforms let you set goals and attach financial penalties for failure. You can even choose where the money goes, anti charity options where your failure funds causes you hate.

Sounds extreme? That's the point. Your comfort zone is what got you stuck. A little external pressure forces your brain to take the goal seriously instead of treating it like a fun fantasy.

There's actual research backing this up. Behavioral economists have found that loss aversion is roughly twice as powerful as the desire for gain. We'll work harder to avoid losing $100 than to gain $100. These commitment devices exploit that wiring.

## 4. Schedule  chaos days 

Once a week, do something completely random and outside your normal operating system. No plan, no productivity, no optimization.

Go to a part of your city you've never been to. Take a class in something you know nothing about. Talk to strangers. Waste time intentionally.

This sounds like productivity heresy but here's why it works: creativity and problem solving require novel inputs. Your brain can't generate new solutions from the same old information. When you're stuck, you probably don't have an information problem, you have a perspective problem.

Austin Kleon writes about this in Steal Like an Artist (NYT bestseller, basically the creative manifesto for the internet generation). He argues that all creative work is essentially remix. You can't create something from nothing. You need raw materials, diverse influences, unexpected connections. And you can't get those sitting in your usual haunts consuming your usual content.

The book is short, visual, and packed with permission to stop trying so hard. It's the best thing I've read on unlocking creativity without the pretentious artist BS.

BeFreed is an AI powered personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that pulls from millions of high quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio content around your specific goals. Type in what you're struggling with, maybe  getting unstuck  or  building better habits,  and it generates a tailored podcast with an adaptive learning plan that fits your schedule.

What makes it useful is the depth control. Start with a 10 minute overview, and if it clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with examples and context. The voice options are genuinely addictive too, from smoky and sarcastic to calm and focused, depending on your mood. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia you can talk to mid podcast to ask questions or get book recommendations based on your unique challenges. All the content goes through strict fact checking and pulls from both public and proprietary databases, so the information stays reliable and science based. Perfect for fitting real learning into commutes or workouts without the doomscroll.

## 5. Use  future self  exercises

Here's a weird one that actually works. Spend 30 minutes writing a detailed letter from your future self, five years from now, describing how you got unstuck and what your life looks like.

Not vague aspirations. Specific details. What does your morning look like? Who are you spending time with? What problems did you solve? What did you give up?

The specificity forces your brain to construct an actual pathway instead of just daydreaming. And when you read it back, you'll notice patterns and priorities you weren't consciously aware of.

Dr. Hal Hershfield at UCLA has done fascinating research on this. He found that people who feel more connected to their future selves make better long term decisions. The problem is most of us treat our future self like a stranger. This exercise creates empathy and connection with that person.

For a deeper dive into this kind of psychological work, the app Finch is surprisingly good. It's gamified mental health that doesn't feel patronizing. You take care of a little bird while building actual self care habits. Sounds silly but it genuinely helps create that future focused mindset.

## 6. The nuclear option: change your inputs completely

For two weeks, cut out everything you normally consume. All of it. Your usual podcasts, YouTube channels, news sources, social media feeds, even the books on your reading list.

Replace them with completely random stuff. Listen to podcasts about topics you know nothing about. Read fiction if you usually read nonfiction. Follow people who have nothing to do with your industry or interests.

This is uncomfortable because we consume content that confirms what we already believe. That's the problem. You're stuck because your current worldview has hit a dead end. You need new frameworks, new metaphors, new ways of thinking.

Tim Ferriss talks about this in The 4 Hour Workweek (over 2 million copies sold, basically launched the lifestyle design movement). Love him or hate him, the book's core insight is valid: most of what we consider  necessary  is just habit. And sometimes the fastest way forward is to question everything you think you know about how life works.

It's polarizing, sure. But if you're genuinely stuck, you need polarizing. You need something that challenges your fundamental assumptions about work, success, and what's possible.

   

Look, none of this is comfortable. That's the whole point. Getting unstuck requires doing things that feel wrong, wasteful, or even reckless. But if what you're currently doing was going to work, it would have worked by now.

The real danger isn't trying something radical. It's staying comfortable while life passes you by.",1,1767268351.0,ArtOfPresence,0,1.0,False

Only Pay For Results Or Your Full Fee Refunded. DM Us To Learn How It Works & See If You Qualify.**

Every website owner, from small business bloggers to enterprise marketing directors, chases the same elusive goal: faster rankings. The SEO industry is full of long-term strategies. Technical audits can take months to implement. Content marketing takes time to mature. And acquiring high-quality backlinks from other sites? That is often a grueling, unpredictable marathon.

But there is one lever you can pull right now that doesn't require budget approval, developer intervention, or cold-emailing strangers. It’s sitting right in your CMS, waiting to be used.

Internal links are the unsung heroes of search engine optimization. While flashy external link-building campaigns get all the glory, a solid internal linking strategy is often the difference between a page that languishes on page two and one that climbs to the top three.

Why? Because unlike external factors, you have 100% control over your internal links. You control the anchor text, the placement, and the destination. When executed correctly, tweaking your internal structure can produce measurable traffic improvements in weeks, not months.

Here is why internal linking is one of the most powerful ""SEO quick wins"" available to you, and how you can harness it to unlock hidden traffic potential.

# The Mechanics of Speed: Why Internal Linking Works Fast

To understand why internal links produce faster results than almost any other tactic, you have to look at how search engines like Google actually work. Googlebot is an explorer. It needs paths to follow. When you build a link from Page A to Page B on your own site, you are essentially paving a road for that explorer.

External link building is slow because it relies on third parties. You have to wait for them to publish, wait for Google to crawl *their* site, and then wait for the authority to transfer. Internal changes happen on your timeline. As soon as you hit ""update"" and request a re-crawl in Google Search Console, the process begins.

There are three primary mechanical reasons why internal links drive rapid changes in search performance: crawl efficiency, authority flow, and semantic understanding.

# 1. Turbocharging Crawl Efficiency

Imagine a library where the books are thrown into a pile on the floor versus one where they are neatly cataloged on shelves with signs pointing to each section. Google prefers the latter.

Crawl budget—the amount of resources Google dedicates to crawling your site—is finite. If your site structure is messy, or if new pages are ""orphaned"" (meaning no other pages link to them), Googlebot might not find them at all. Even if it does, it might not return frequently to check for updates.

By strategically placing internal links on high-traffic, high-authority pages that point to newer or deeper content, you are creating a highway for spiders. You are explicitly telling Google, ""Go here next.""

When you improve your internal linking structure, you increase the likelihood that Google indexes your content faster and refreshes its cache more often. This immediate accessibility is the first step toward faster rankings. You can’t rank if you aren't crawled, and you won't rank well if you aren't crawled efficiently.

# 2. The Direct Flow of Authority (PageRank)

We often talk about ""Domain Authority"" as a metric, but Google’s original algorithm, PageRank, operates on a page-level basis. When a page on your site receives a great backlink from the New York Times, that specific page accumulates authority.

If that high-authority page doesn't link to anything else, that ""link juice"" sits stagnant. It’s wasted potential.

Internal linking allows you to redistribute that wealth. By linking from your ""power pages"" (those with many external backlinks) to your ""money pages"" (landing pages or product pages that need to rank), you pass that authority along.

This creates a rising tide that lifts all boats. Unlike building new external links, which adds *new* authority to the bucket, internal linking ensures the authority you *already have* isn't leaking out. It funnels it exactly where it needs to go. This transfer of equity happens almost immediately after Google recrawls the linking page, leading to faster movement in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

# 3. Establishing Topical Authority and Relevance

Google doesn't just look at *how much* authority a page has; it looks at *what* the page is about. This is where the concept of the ""knowledge graph"" comes in.

When you link three articles about ""running shoes,"" ""marathon training,"" and ""proper jogging form"" together, you are creating a cluster of relevance. You are demonstrating to the search engine that you are an expert on running.

Internal links with descriptive anchor text help Google understand the context of the destination page. If you link to a page using the text ""best CRM software,"" you are sending a strong signal that the target page is relevant for that keyword.

This semantic signaling is incredibly fast-acting. It clarifies the relationship between pages, resolving ambiguity. If Google was previously unsure whether your page was about ""apple"" the fruit or ""Apple"" the tech company, internal context clues solve that puzzle instantly, allowing the page to rank for the right terms.

# Real-World Examples: Unlocking Traffic in Weeks

The theory sounds great, but does it work in practice? Absolutely. SEO professionals prioritize internal links during the ""quick win"" phase of a project specifically because the data supports it.

Consider a scenario involving a SaaS company with a blog. They had a high-performing article about ""Remote Work Productivity"" that had attracted dozens of backlinks over two years. However, their actual product page—a project management tool designed for remote teams—was stuck on page 3 of Google.

The strategy was simple:

1. Identify the ""power page"" (the blog post).
2. Identify the ""target page"" (the product page).
3. Add a contextual internal link in the first two paragraphs of the blog post using exact-match anchor text pointing to the product page.
4. Identify 5 other supporting blog posts and link them to the product page.

**The Result:** Within three weeks of re-indexing, the product page moved from position #24 to position #8. Traffic to the product page increased by 40%. No new external links were built. The site simply used the authority it already possessed more effectively.

Another example involves an e-commerce store selling camping gear. They had thousands of product pages but very little structure. Tents were not linking to sleeping bags, and blog posts about ""camping tips"" didn't link to products.

After implementing a ""Related Products"" section and manually adding in-content links from their blog to their top-selling categories, overall organic impressions jumped by 150% in under a month. The ""internal links SEO benefits"" were clear: better user navigation led to longer dwell times, and better crawler paths led to higher rankings.

# How to execute a High-Impact Internal Linking Strategy

Knowing *why* it works is half the battle. Knowing *how* to execute it prevents you from making messy mistakes. Here is a streamlined internal linking strategy to get those quick wins.

# Audit Your Power Pages

Start by using a tool like Ahrefs, SEMrush, or even Google Search Console to find your most authoritative pages. These are the pages with the most backlinks or the most traffic.

Once you have this list, review the content. Are there natural opportunities to link to your lower-performing but high-value pages? If the content is relevant, add the link. If it’s not relevant, can you add a section that *makes* it relevant?

# Fix Orphaned Content

Orphaned pages are islands in your website’s ocean. They have zero internal links pointing to them. If a page is important enough to exist, it is important enough to be linked to.

Crawl your site to identify these orphans. Once found, find a relevant ""parent"" topic on your site and link to the orphan. This is often the fastest way to get a non-ranking page onto the scoreboard.

# Optimize Anchor Text (But Don’t Overdo It)

Anchor text—the clickable words in a link—matters immensely. You want to be descriptive. Instead of saying ""click here,"" say ""read our guide on SEO quick wins.""

However, exercise caution. While you can be more aggressive with exact-match keywords internally than you can with external backlinks, you still want to sound natural. Variation is key. If every single link to your ""Blue Widgets"" page says exactly ""Blue Widgets,"" it can look spammy. Mix it up with ""our blue widget collection,"" ""best widgets in blue,"" or ""buying widgets.""

# The ""Hub and Spoke"" Model

The most effective way to structure internal links is the Hub and Spoke model (also known as Topic Clusters).

* **The Hub:** A main pillar page covering a broad topic (e.g., ""The Ultimate Guide to Coffee"").
* **The Spokes:** Supporting articles covering specific sub-topics (e.g., ""French Press vs. Pour Over,"" ""Best Beans for Espresso,"" ""History of Arabica"").

The Hub links to all the Spokes. Crucially, all the Spokes link back to the Hub. This creates a tight loop of relevance that boosts the authority of the entire cluster.

# Why Results-Based SEO Prioritizes Internal Links

When an agency or consultant promises ""results-based SEO,"" they are under pressure to show movement quickly. They know that a technical audit might take months to show ROI and that PR campaigns are expensive.

Internal linking is the low-hanging fruit that isn't actually ""low value."" It is high value, low friction.

It improves User Experience (UX) immediately. It keeps visitors on the site longer, reducing bounce rates and increasing page views. These user signals interact with the technical SEO benefits to create a compounding effect.

Furthermore, internal linking is sustainable. It doesn't break when a third-party site goes down. It doesn't violate Google’s guidelines (unless you are doing something deceptive like hiding links). It is a foundational element of a healthy website architecture.

If you are looking for a way to improve your metrics before the next quarterly review, stop looking outward and start looking inward. The links you need are likely already writing themselves; you just have to connect the dots.

# Frequently Asked Questions About Internal Linking

# How many internal links should a page have?

There is no magic number, but the general rule is ""as many as are helpful for the user."" A 500-word blog post might have 2-3 relevant internal links, while a 2,000-word pillar page might have 10-15. Avoid ""link stuffing."" If the screen looks like a sea of blue underlined text, you have gone too far. Google advises keeping the links on a page to a ""reasonable number,"" which in the past was capped at 100, but modern crawling can handle more. Focus on quality and relevance over quantity.

# Do internal links help rankings?

Yes, unequivocally. They help rankings by distributing PageRank (authority) to specific pages, helping Google understand the topical relevance of a page, and ensuring that crawlers can actually find and index the content. Without internal links, even great content can remain invisible to search engines.

# How fast do internal links impact SEO?

Internal links can impact SEO as fast as Google crawls the page. If you add links to a popular page that is crawled daily, you could see changes in rankings or impressions within a few days to a few weeks. It is significantly faster than external link building, which can take months to show impact.

# Are footer links good for SEO?

Footer links are useful for navigation and ensuring that essential pages (like ""About Us,"" ""Contact,"" or main category pages) are never more than one click away. However, Google generally values in-content links (links inside the body of an article) more highly than footer or sidebar links. Contextual links provide more information about what the linked page is actually about. Use footer links for site structure, but rely on body links for boosting rankings for specific keywords.

# Start Connecting Your Content Today

The beauty of internal linking is its accessibility. You don't need to hire an agency or buy expensive software to start. You simply need to know your own content and understand how it connects.

Start small. Pick your top five performing pages and ensure they are linking to your most important conversion pages. Then, find your five newest articles and ensure they have inbound links from established content.

By treating your internal links as a strategic asset rather than an afterthought, you turn your website into a cohesive ecosystem rather than a collection of scattered pages. The results are often rapid, measurable, and entirely within your control.

I’m trying to understand a long-term issue I’ve had for many years and I’m wondering if anyone here can relate.

For as long as I can remember (since my early 20s), I’ve had **very strong reactions after alcohol**, especially spirits like anise drinks, wine, or beer. Even small amounts (2–3 drinks) can trigger it.

# What happens the next day:

* I wake up **very early**, even though my body clearly needs sleep
* Strong **light sensitivity**
* **Brain fog**, flu-like feeling, heavy head
* Feeling overstimulated / wired but exhausted
* **Facial burning, stinging, tight skin**, sometimes mild swelling

# Scalp & hair symptoms (this is the most confusing part):

* **Burning / painful scalp**, tenderness when touching, washing, or wearing a hat
* Scalp becomes **very oily sometimes**, other times **dry and tight** (no consistency)
* Periods of **diffuse hair shedding** (not patchy, not classic male pattern)
* Hair loss seems to worsen after alcohol, sugar, poor sleep, or stress
* Dermatology exams show follicles still present (vellus hairs, no scarring)

I’ve noticed that:

* Alcohol, sugar, coffee, and lack of sleep make everything worse
* Avoiding them calms my scalp and nervous system somewhat
* This doesn’t feel like a normal “hangover” — it feels inflammatory and neurological

I don’t have classic food allergies, rashes, or anaphylaxis. It feels more like my body **overreacts internally**.

I’m starting to wonder whether this could be related to:

* **histamine intolerance**
* **mast cell activation**
* or some kind of neuro-inflammatory scalp condition (trichodynia / sensitive scalp)

Has anyone experienced something similar — especially the **combination of systemic reactions + burning scalp + hair shedding**?

What helped you the most (diet, antihistamines, gut work, stress reduction, etc.)?

# Mastering the Sandwalk

I fairly simple technique is to use any softstep boots and shigawire claw to cover large distances on foot in the deep desert. The key is to use a companion app or map like those provided by the Dune Awakening Database, to plan your routes across the sands.

You can see roughly where the rock formations are and plan what routes to sandwalk and when to use the advanced version which I will discuss later.

[Master your fear and you will master the desert](https://preview.redd.it/hzx5tyw57kag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b542df5b820d5520e23f04f5d90cf56f22eb2f0)

To put your mind at ease about being eaten by the Sandworm you can use skills like Bindu Sprint and take a Full Suspensor belt to get to safety, however in most cases it is not necessary because you will not trigger the Sandworm.

The technique is simply to run but not sprint and then shigawire some distance and continue to run and then shigawire when the cooldown is finished. Because we are limiting how much time we are touching the sand and with the softstep boots giving us aggro reduction we can cross large tracts of open sand without annoying Shai Hulud or ever triggering it.

*Note: In the upcoming chapter 3 update a specialisation adds another possible 10% sandworm aggro reduction.*

  
If you do aggro Shai Hulud you can Bindu Sprint to safety and if it's far to the rocks, jump and use your Full Suspensor belt to get to safety. Be careful not to Bindu sprint up a dune and jump too soon because you will face plant into the dune and your Bindu Sprint will be on cooldown with the Sandworm chasing you down. This has definitely never happened to me.

To avoid this it is best to Sandwalk on the top or ridge of the dune or at the base of two dunes going parallel to the direction of the dune ridges. Mostly they run in a north south direction. That way you will have nice flat terrain and no obstacles in your way.

  
A more advanced form to cover longer distances, say around 1km, is to use spice prescience to reduce the cooldown of Shigawire Claw so you can sandwalk huge distances without ever triggering the Sandworm. So keep some spice food handy to get your prescience back when you need to.



# Making your own water

As you know there are no flowers in the Deep Desert to harvest however there are two techniques you can use to make your own water just like Muad'dib and stay out in the desert indefinitely for as long as you want. We are talking about personal water of course not the large amounts used for refining and processing. 

The first active technique uses a filter extractor Mk6 and any blood bag and literjon. A Hajra Mk6 is best and the Baron's blood bag is a nice compromise on weight vs capacity but you could also use Scipio's blood bag for example. Again it's not as weight efficient as a Decaliterjon but for Fremen roleplay and the fact that we never need to go back to a base to top up, it will serve us well. 

We get our water by extracting it directly from NPCs in caves or from the labs if you are running them. The water will go directly into your literjon. Unfortunately we cannot dump blood out of our blood bag but we can just bring some salvaged metal and if you have a base slot free just put down a subfief console and a basic blood purifier and dump the blood into it. You don't need power or generators, just delete the purifier when it's full and rebuild it until the blood bag is empty and delete the purifier and console and you're good to go. 

[Muad'dib makes his own water](https://preview.redd.it/udj8v5sjbkag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0eb2cf895dac4fbf63492ad84a5c5ecdc3135a84)

  
The second way is a passive water generation technique using the stilltent. Again the important thing is to have a base slot free. Place down your console (you don't need power) and then place your stilltent, preferably the double sided stilltent. You will get the water sealed effect meaning you will lose next to no water but your stilltent will be generating water passively. Use this when you are in a hidden spot and go off and make a cup of coffee or tea, when you come back your stilltent will be full and most importantly it will generate a net positive of water for you. You will never run our of water in the Deep Desert again even if you forgot to bring a literjon. Not that I have ever done that either.



# Stealth and Cunning

*""The trick to not being discovered until it is too late is to become part of the expected surroundings. Stealth is more the art of blending in with the background than sneaking through dark shadows."" — Raymond E. Feist*

Moving around the Deep Desert on foot may seem like a crazy idea but we actually have the advantage in terms of stealth and situational awareness. 

[Rest in black Shade, Bi-lal Kaifa](https://preview.redd.it/ha7fiivpekag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78d776e39a439122b4a9a64893e4023c4b7da384)

With the changes made to thopter draw distance, we can see while being unseen. On foot our draw distance is much smaller allowing us to see any potential threat from a long way away, giving you time to take action if needed or to simply stay put and let it pass.

This is why it is a good idea to sandwalk at the top of a dune so we can see around as far as possible and scan the horizon for signs of enemies. It's also good to shigawire to the top of a rock formation if it's blocking your view and do a 360 scan to regain situational awareness and spot potential threats before they are even aware of you. Use your binoculars when you see a thopter and ascertain roughly what direction they are going in. 



**Blending in with your surroundings**

  
There are two very good swatches to use for camouflage. At night time we want to use the Vermillius Gap swatch which has a lovely maroon colour that matches the colour the rocks extremely well. The darkness is also our ally as it makes us much harder to see especially if we are standing still. The human eye is drawn to movement so if in doubt just stop and stand still. 

The second swatch is not a swatch but a stillsuit, namely the imperial stillsuit, it has an orange colour as it's default colour which blends in with the rocks during the day and makes us almost invisible when not moving, especially from a distance.

When you are moving, try and move from cover to cover and constantly scan the skies when in the PvP area. If you get caught unaware and you hear the sound of a thopter hovering, don't panic. It is likely that they haven't seen you because they would not have announced their presence by hovering. Crouch and stay still or get to cover if you can. Listen and turn the camera to get a rough idea of where they are by sound and then assess the situation from there. 

I have had people land close to me and start mining while I was crouched within 20m of them and they were oblivious to my presence because I didn't move and they were so focused on mining. 

[Remain still and become one with the desert](https://preview.redd.it/byrycjz3skag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cbea7e7c255ea921c9e4e2d65b299c2f0c8992e)

For these reasons I would recommend sandwalking mostly at night, firstly you avoid the problem of losing water to sunstroke and secondly you become much harder to see in the darkness. 

  
Use verticality to your advantage. Humans are used to seeing things on one plane, things that are at eye level. You would be surprised how effective it is just to get out of that eye level because often people tend to simply not look up. Also people don't expect a crazy Fremen to be standing in the exact spot that they land to do some mining in the vastness of the deep desert. 

# Advanced Tips and Tricks

We have already discussed some additional uses of the stilltent with the subfief console to make water but there is another use we can take advantage of. If you place a console and then your stilltent you will get the watersealed effect as I mentioned. This also means that technically you are in your base and you are watersealed. So it's possible to learn blueprints wherever you are in the Deep Desert without ever having to return to your base.

Another advanced and also very Fremen lore friendly thing to do is to place your stilltent in flour sand. This is more situational and RNG dependent but the basic idea is you can use the the flour sand and the cloud that comes off it to hide and camouflage yourself out on the open sands. If it is near a large spice field you can also use it to launch ambushes on offworlders harvesting spice. Try and fly around first and pick the thickest part of the cloud and place your stilltent there. You can stay there for a very long time without attracting the sand worm's attention because you are not moving. Just use your thopter to fly up and reset the worm's aggro bar and then land, pocket your thopter and get into the stilltent.

[Perfectly hidden, ready to strike](https://preview.redd.it/kbt8bbsnwkag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db073a76e3992893a191fa17a888cbe1338d85f3)

Also people generally do not expect you to be hiding in flour sand and will not be examining it too closely. Most of the time they are looking for spice sand or they are flying to the labs and caves etc so they will fly right over the cloud and not even see you.

# Seeking the Hidden Places

There are many hidden places in the Deep Desert just waiting to be discovered. Most players fly from point to point and rarely explore the rock formations on foot. There are tiny hidden areas where you can build a small camp or even just a hidden cache and place a few basic chests without anyone knowing they are there. You can store spare fuel or dump components and resources from lab runs or caves and come back later to transport them back to your base.

[You may think there's nothing there?](https://preview.redd.it/9udkmxw33qag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=900d0ddf7a8f60575a9cd0dfb97058e5dc947248)

I won't spoil the locations for you wali, it is for you to find these hidden places. Whether you use them as mini hidden caches or use them to rest in your stilltent or use them as a base to launch ambushes, the choice is yours. You will know the desert better than anyone.

[A hidden entrance?](https://preview.redd.it/8w45z14j3qag1.jpg?width=2560&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a25c5d2c77f4f9bd98a6a814aa2c7ac646d1e45)

You now know what you need to master the ways of the desert, to flow with it, become one with it. Of course there are some secrets of the Fremen I cannot share, you will have to learn them for yourself and if we meet in the Deep Desert, perhaps I will share some of them with you. Until then wali, may your footsteps be light and your crysknife sharp.

Emily traced the line of Sakura’s shoulder, her fingers brushing over smooth skin still warm from their bodies. The room smelled of sandalwood candle and sex, a heavy, comforting perfume.

“You’re thinking too loud,” Sakura murmured, her voice a sleepy hum against Emily’s chest.

“Am not.”

“Your heartbeat changed. It gets all… deliberate.” Sakura propped herself up on an elbow. Her dark hair fell like a curtain, framing a face that was all gentle curiosity. “What’s up?”

Emily stared at the fairy lights twinkling above them, little pinpricks of gold in the dimness. Her mouth felt dry. This was it, the thing she’d carried around for months, a secret stone in her pocket. Saying it out loud would make it real. It would change the air between them.

“I have this… fantasy,” Emily started, the word too loud in the quiet room. She felt Sakura go still beside her. “It’s not a replacement. It’s an addition. Does that make sense?”

Sakura nodded, her expression open, waiting. She never judged. That was the bedrock of them.

Emily took a sharp breath. “I think about… being with a man. Specifically, a Black man.” She rushed the last part out, her face heating. “There. I said it.”

Silence stretched, filled only by the distant sound of a car horn from the street below. Emily braced for confusion, for hurt.

Instead, Sakura let out a long, slow sigh. Not of disappointment, but of relief. “Oh, thank god.”

Emily blinked. “What?”

A small, incredulous laugh escaped Sakura. She rolled onto her back, staring at the ceiling. “I have the same one. I’ve had it for… years. I just never knew how to say it without it sounding like some gross fetish.”

The tension in Emily’s shoulders unraveled all at once, leaving her lightheaded. A shared secret. A mirrored desire. It wasn’t just her.

“It feels treacherous sometimes,” Emily whispered, the confession tumbling out now. “Like, here I am, a lesbian activist, waving a flag for woman-love, and my brain is hosting this… this vivid, private film featuring a man. A Black man. And the politics of it… Jesus, the politics are a minefield. It feels like a betrayal of my politics and my identity all at once.”

Sakura turned her head on the pillow. “Who owns your desire, Em? The movement? Or you?”

“It’s not that simple.”

“Isn’t it?” Sakura’s voice was soft but firm. “We spend all this time fighting for the freedom to love who we want, how we want. But then we build our own little prisons with the rules. Gay, straight, bi—what if it’s all just… human? What if my ‘lesbian’ label is mostly true, but has a single, very specific exception?” She reached for Emily’s hand, lacing their fingers together. “The fantasy isn’t about some anonymous body. It’s about… power. Contrast. A different kind of energy. It feels like the ultimate transgression, and that’s part of the heat of it, for me.”

Emily listened, her heart hammering. Sakura was articulating the tangled mess in her own head. The shame wasn’t in the desire itself, but in the fear of what it meant about her, her beliefs, her community.

“It’s the presumption,” Emily said quietly. “The way society just expects it of white women like me. The hungry looks, the ‘jungle fever’ jokes, the whole historical fuckery of it. I don’t want to be a cliché. I want it to be… mine. Ours. On our terms.”

“So we reclaim it,” Sakura said, her eyes glinting in the low light. A new energy was buzzing in the room, crackling between them. “We don’t let the trolls and the stereotypes define our private world.”

A slow, daring idea began to form, fragile as a soap bubble. Emily gave voice to it before she could lose her nerve. “What if… we didn’t just talk about it? What if we explored it? Together.”

Sakura’s breath hitched. “Like… how?”

“I don’t know. Research. Talking. Maybe… eventually… finding someone. Not a random hookup. Someone we trust. Someone who understands it’s about a shared experience, not conquest.” Emily squeezed her hand. “A third, not a replacement. An addition. Like you said.”

The word ‘we’ hung in the air, transforming the fantasy from a solitary, guilty pleasure into a collaborative project. A journey they’d take side-by-side. The intimacy of that was, in its own way, more terrifying and more thrilling than the fantasy itself.

Sakura was quiet for a long moment, thinking. Then a slow, mischievous smile spread across her face, the one that always made Emily’s stomach flip. “We’d need rules. Communication. A ton of communication.”

“Obviously,” Emily said, a laugh bubbling up, part nerves, part wild elation.

“And we’d have to be stupidly careful. About safety. About feelings. About the person we choose.”

“We’re not idiots.”

“Debatable.” Sakura shifted, rolling on top of Emily, her weight a familiar comfort. “This is crazy.”

“Completely.”

“Are we really doing this?”

Emily looked up at her, at the face she loved, now alight with a new kind of excitement. The secret was out. It was no longer a stone in her pocket, but a seed they had planted together. She felt a surge of something potent—not just arousal, but a profound sense of agency. This was theirs to shape.

“Yeah,” Emily whispered, pulling Sakura down for a kiss that tasted like possibility and salt. “I think we really are.”

Outside, the world went on with its noise and its rules. But in the soft glow oAwakening Desiresf the dorm room, a new, quiet plot was just beginning.

Chapter 2 First Steps

The dawn light was a pale, unforgiving thing. It seeped around the edges of the blinds, striping the rumpled bed and highlighting the empty mugs on the floor. The cozy sanctuary of the night before felt different now—exposed, the clutter more apparent, the air stale with spent breath and anticipation.

Emily was already awake, phone glowing in her hands. Sakura lay with her head on Emily’s stomach, eyes tracing the water stain on the ceiling.

“So,” Sakura said, her voice scratchy with sleep. “Google phase?”

“Google phase,” Emily confirmed, scrolling. She’d been at it for twenty minutes, her enthusiasm curdling into something more complicated. “It’s a minefield. Like, literally every other result is either gross porn or an academic paper on racial fetishization. There’s no… manual.”

“What did you expect? ‘Ethical Threesomes for Dummies’?”

“A girl can hope.” Emily put the phone down, screen-first, on her chest. “The porn is… it’s exactly what we’re trying not to be. All these ridiculous phrases. It’s dehumanizing. And the comments sections are just sewage.”

Sakura shifted, turning to look up at her. “And the academic stuff?”

“Makes me feel like I need to take a shower and then write a ten-point thesis statement before I’m allowed to have a single thought.” Emily ran a hand through her tangled red hair. “I know the history. I teach the history in my advocacy workshops. Colonialism, sexual exploitation, the whole brutal narrative. Knowing it intellectually and… feeling this desire anyway… it doesn’t cancel the history out. It just makes everything feel loaded.”

“Heavy,” Sakura agreed softly.

“Yeah. Heavy.”

They lay in silence for a minute, listening to the building groan. The fantasy, in the dark, had been pure heat and possibility. In the gray morning light, it was a tangled knot of want, politics, and fear.

“We need to talk about what we actually want,” Sakura said, finally sitting up. She pulled the sheet around her shoulders. “Not in vague ‘exploration’ terms. Concrete things. Boundaries.”

“Right. Okay.” Emily sat up too, crossing her legs. She grabbed a notebook from her nightstand—the one she used for lecture notes and protest planning. She clicked a pen. “Start simple. What’s the goal?”

Sakura chewed her lip. “Connection. A shared experience. It’s not about just… watching each other with someone else. It’s about being in it together. All three of us.”

Emily wrote SHARED EXPERIENCE in block letters. “Yes. Okay. So we’re looking for a person, not a prop. Someone who gets that.”

“And who we’re attracted to, obviously. But attraction is more than… you know.”

“Physical. Yeah.” Emily tapped the pen. “They have to be cool. Funny. Smart enough to grasp the dynamics. Emotionally intelligent. Consciously Black, probably. Like, aware of the baggage and willing to talk about it.”

“That’s a big ask,” Sakura said, a wry smile playing on her lips. “Find a handsome, emotionally available, culturally literate man who is interested in two queer women and ready to deconstruct racial-sexual politics over coffee before anything happens. Easy.”

“Shut up,” Emily laughed, but it was strained. “We have to be picky. This isn’t a Grindr splash. This is us.” She looked down at the notebook. “Rules. For us.”

Sakura leaned forward. “No separate communication. Everything in a group chat. Total transparency.”

“Written and signed in blood,” Emily said, writing it down. “Veto power. Either of us can call a full stop, anytime, no explanation needed in the moment.”

“Aftercare. For all three of us. But especially for us, after. We check in. We process.”

“Safe sex is non-negotiable. Like, laboratory-grade, discuss-before-touching non-negotiable.”

The list grew, each item a plank in a shaky bridge stretching over a chasm of uncertainty. They talked about jealousy, acknowledging it would probably happen, and planning how to handle it. They talked about meeting in public first, multiple times. They talked about not using the word “BBC” ever again, outside of their own private whispers, because the acronym felt tainted now, reduced to a porn category.

“It’s about a person,” Emily said firmly, underlining the word PERSON three times. “Not a stereotype. Not a fantasy. A real, whole person who we like and who likes us, back.”

“And if we can’t find that person?” Sakura asked, her voice quiet.

“Then we don’t do it. The fantasy was fun. Our reality is better.” Emily meant it. The thought of not going through with it was a relief, in a way. A safe retreat.

But Sakura’s eyes held a spark of something else—a stubborn curiosity. “We should look on Feeld. It’s less… hookup-y than some apps. More people into non-traditional stuff who have actually thought about it.”

Emily felt a jolt of adrenaline. Naming the tool made it real. “Okay. We create a profile. Together. Tonight.”

The morning solidified around them, the plan taking shape not as a wild dream, but as a project with steps and parameters. It felt manageable. Less like falling, more like a controlled climb.

Sakura got up to make coffee. As the bitter, familiar scent filled the room, Emily looked at the notebook page. Their rules, their hopes, their fears, all laid out in her messy handwriting. It was the most terrifying and exciting piece of activism she’d ever drafted. This wasn’t about changing the world out there. It was about understanding, and maybe reclaiming, the strange, complicated world of desire within themselves.

Sakura handed her a steaming mug. “We’re really doing this, aren’t we?”

Emily took the mug, letting the heat sear her palms. The fear was still there, a low hum in her blood. But under it, stronger now, was a current of pure, unadulterated possibility. She thought of their phrase from the night before. An addition, not a replacement.

“Yeah,” she said, meeting Sakura’s gaze. “We’re doing it.”

Chapter 3 The First Test

The Velvet Note was exactly the kind of place that felt both thrilling and terribly adult. The bass line from the trio on stage thrummed up through the worn floorboards into Emily’s bones. It was crowded, dark, the air a layered haze of cigar smoke from the VIP lounge and the earthy scent of spilled beer. She clutched Sakura’s hand, a quick, hard squeeze, as they navigated through the sea of small round tables.

“He said corner booth, back near the fire exit,” Sakura murmured, her eyes scanning the shadows.

And there he was.

Darius Jones was both exactly and nothing like his profile pictures. The photos had shown a man with a sharp, knowing smile and calm eyes. In person, he held space differently. He was tall, leaned back in the booth with an easy ownership of his own limbs, drumming long fingers silently on the tabletop in perfect time with the music. He wore a simple black henley, the sleeves pushed up to his elbows. He was watching the band, but as they approached, his gaze slid to them. It was a direct, assessing look that made Emily feel instantly seen, and not just in a physical way.

“Hey,” he said, his voice a low, pleasant rumble that cut through the musical din. He didn’t stand up, just gestured to the open seats with a tilt of his head. “You found it. Glad you made it.”

They slid into the booth opposite him, a thick slab of scarred oak between them. The rules felt absurd now, a childish script.

“Thanks for meeting us,” Emily said, too loudly, then winced at her own volume.

“Our pleasure,” Sakura added, her voice steadier. “This place is great.”

Darius nodded, a slow, easy motion. “It’s my sanctuary. The music’s always honest here. You want a drink? First round’s on me.”

They ordered—a whiskey neat for him, a beer for Sakura, a ginger ale for Emily, who knew her nerves needed no fuel. The waitress vanished into the gloom.

An awkward silence bloomed, filled only by the sultry cry of the saxophone. This was the moment. The chasm between the thousand theoretical discussions in Emily’s dorm and the living, breathing man across from them.

Darius broke it. He leaned forward, forearms on the table, and looked at them, his glance encompassing both equally. “So. You two have a list, right?”

Emily felt her cheeks burn. Sakura let out a soft, startled laugh.

“I mean, you seem like list people,” he continued, a faint, non-malicious smile on his lips. “The profile was very… thorough. Very considerate. I appreciate that. Most people just send a eggplant and a fire emoji.”

The tension shattered. Emily exhaled, a real laugh bubbling up. “It’s a pretty long list.”

“I bet it is.” He took a sip of the water already on the table. “Here’s my thing. I’m not interested in being a guest star in your personal journey of discovery. I’m not a teachable moment. And I’m definitely not a fantasy dispenser.” He said it calmly, without accusation. It was a statement of fact.

“That’s… that’s what we want, too,” Sakura said quickly. “That’s why the list. We don’t want a fantasy. We want a person.”

“Good.” Darius sat back again, studying them. “Because I looked at your profiles too. Emily, all the social justice stuff. It’s commendable. But it makes me wonder.”

“Wonder what?” Emily asked, her activist hackles rising faintly, mixed with a thrill that he’d looked.

“If you’re more in love with the idea of doing this ‘correctly’ than you are with the actual, messy possibility of it.” He held up a hand before she could protest. “I’m not saying you are. I’m saying it’s a question. This,” he gestured between the three of them, “if it happens, won’t be correct. It’ll be messy. Feelings don’t follow rules, no matter how well-intentioned.”

The drinks arrived, a timely interruption. Emily took a gulp of her ginger ale, the sweet fizz doing nothing to cool the heat in her throat. He was cutting right through it all, bypassing the politics and zeroing in on the personal hypocrisy they’d both secretly feared.

“We know that,” Emily said, finally. “The list isn’t a blueprint. It’s a… a safety net. So we don’t hurt each other. Or you.”

“Fair.” Darius took a slow sip of his whiskey, his eyes closing briefly as he savored it. When he opened them, his expression was softer. “Let’s try something. Forget the list for five minutes. Tell me why you’re really here. Not the philosophical thesis. The human reason.”

Another silence, but this one felt charged, fertile. The saxophonist began a slow, melancholy solo that seemed to curl around their booth.

Sakura spoke first, her voice barely above a whisper. “I love her. I want to see her… lit up. And I want to feel lit up, with her. I want an experience that’s just ours, that exists outside of every other part of our lives.”

Darius nodded, his eyes on Sakura, listening deeply.

Emily felt the truth rise, unbidden and raw. “I’m scared of my own desire,” she admitted, shocking herself. “I can deconstruct it, I can talk about its place in a racist patriarchy until I’m blue in the face. But it’s still there. And with her,” she glanced at Sakura, “it feels safe to finally… touch it.”

Darius was quiet for a long moment, the music washing over them. He let out a long, slow breath.

“Okay,” he said, simply. “Now we’re somewhere real.” He swirled the amber liquid in his glass. “I’ll be honest with you, too. I’m selective. This isn’t my usual… scene. But you two felt different. Thoughtful. And honestly, a little terrifying in your thoughtfulness.” He smirked. “It intrigued me. I’m a musician. I’m interested in harmony. In dissonance that resolves into something interesting. What you’re talking about is some complex fucking chords.”

The analogy landed perfectly with Emily. It made sense of the noise in her head.

“So what’s your… human reason?” Sakura asked, emboldened.

He looked at her, then at Emily, his gaze lingering. “I like women who know their own minds. Who aren’t afraid of complexity. And,” he added, a playful glint returning to his eye, “you’re both painfully attractive. Let’s not pretend that’s not part of it.”

The straightforward compliment hit Emily like a sunbeam, warm and uncomplicated. It cut through hours of anxious analysis.

“So,” Darius said, setting his glass down with a soft click. “We have a first meeting. It’s not a disaster. You’re not monsters. I’m not a caricature. Do we want a second one?”

Emily looked at Sakura. She saw her own nervous excitement mirrored there, along with a dawning trust. This wasn’t what they’d scripted. It was better. It was real.

“Yes,” they said in unison, and then laughed at their own unison.

“Good.” Darius smiled, a real, wide smile that transformed his face. “Next time, we pick a place with worse acoustics. So we can actually hear each other think. And maybe,” he said, pulling out his phone, “we can start that famous group chat. For logistics.”

As they exchanged numbers, the band kicked into an upbeat, swinging number. The mood in the booth lifted, the conversation turning to music, to campus, to anything but the weighty thing they were tentatively building. The theories were packed away. All that was left was the heat of his attention, the solid reality of his laugh rolling over them, and the terrifying, thrilling sense that they had just stepped off the edge of a very carefully drawn map.

Chapter 4 The First Taste

The group chat had been a constant, low-grade hum of anticipation for a week. Logistics. That’s what Darius had called it. The messages were a mix of the profoundly practical and the nerve-wrackingly intimate.

Darius: Loft address is 1812 Granville, top floor. Keypad is 0914.

Sakura: Should we bring anything?

Darius: Just yourselves.

Emily: What are the… rules for tonight?

Darius: The only rule is everyone can say stop. Beyond that, we see what happens.

Now, standing in the silent elevator riding up to the penthouse, Emily felt the list they’d so meticulously written disintegrate in her mind. It was theoretical ash. Sakura’s hand found hers, her palm slightly damp.

“We can still just have a drink and leave,” Sakura whispered.

“Do you want to?” Emily asked, hearing the tremor in her own voice.

Sakura shook her head, her dark eyes wide.

The elevator doors opened directly into the loft. The city sprawled beyond a wall of glass, a tapestry of diamond lights against a velvet sky. The space was vast, minimalist, but warm. Polished concrete floors, a few low, deep sofas in charcoal grey, shelves overflowing with books and vinyl records. A grand piano, a sleek black beast, dominated one corner. The air smelled faintly of citrus cleaner and, underneath, the jasmine from several thriving plants.

Darius emerged from a hallway, barefoot, in soft-looking grey sweatpants and a plain white t-shirt. He looked more relaxed, more real, than he had in the bar.

“You found it,” he said, a simple echo of his first greeting. “Come in. Kick your shoes off anywhere.”

They did, the act feeling both domestic and profoundly vulnerable. He led them to the sitting area, where three glasses and a bottle of amber rum sat on a low table. “Not whiskey tonight,” he said, pouring. “Something smoother.”

They sat, the three of them forming a loose triangle. The initial silence wasn’t awkward, but thick with potential. Emily took a sip. The rum was warm, sweet, tracing a fire down her throat to her stomach.

“How’s the harmony?” Darius asked, a slight smile on his lips, referencing his own metaphor.

“A lot of dissonance right now,” Emily admitted, forcing a laugh. “Mostly in my head.”

“Mine too,” Sakura said.

Darius nodded. “Good. That’s honest. You wanna know a secret? Mine as well.” He took a long drink. “I was thinking. You came to me with a list of wants. Principles. Which is amazing. But I think we skip ahead sometimes. We talk about the symphony but forget to listen to the individual notes.” He nodded towards the piano. “I play. You listen. Just be. See where that takes us.”

It wasn’t a demand. It was an offering. Emily and Sakura exchanged a glance, a silent agreement passing between them. They nodded.

Darius stood and walked to the piano. He didn’t perform. He simply sat on the bench, his back to them, broad shoulders relaxed. For a long moment, he was still. Then his hands, those long, clever fingers, came down on the keys.

It wasn’t a song Emily recognized. It was an improvisation, a slow, searching series of chords that felt like a question. The sound filled the high-ceilinged space, vibrating in the glass, in the floor, in the hollow of Emily’s chest. It was dark and sweet and melancholy all at once.

She watched his back, the shifting muscles under the thin cotton of his shirt as he played. Sakura leaned into her, head on her shoulder, eyes closed. The theoretical scaffolding in Emily’s mind finally, completely, fell away. There was no analysis now. Only sensation. The taste of rum on her tongue. The weight of Sakura against her. The visual of Darius, powerful and focused, weaving sound out of the air.

The music changed. It deepened, the rhythm becoming more insistent, a low, throbbing bass note repeating with a primal pulse. The melody over it was light, playful, dancing over that solid foundation. It felt, impossibly, like a physical touch.

Darius played for what felt like both a minute and an hour. He ended not with a finale, but a decrescendo, the notes fading until the last one hung in the air and dissolved into the city’s hum.

The silence that followed was different. Charged. Soft.

He turned on the bench to face them. In the low light, his expression was open, unguarded. “So,” he said, his voice a gravelly whisper. “Where are we now?”

Emily knew. The dissonance in her head had resolved into a single, clear, vibrating note of pure want. She stood up. Sakura’s hand slipped from hers. She took the few steps across the cool concrete floor until she was standing before him at the piano. She could smell the clean cotton of his shirt, a hint of his soap.

“I don’t want to think anymore,” she said, her own voice foreign to her.

He looked up at her, his gaze intense. “What do you want?”

“To feel.”

He reached out, slowly, giving her every chance to recoil. His hand, warm and large, cupped the side of her face, his thumb brushing over the scattering of freckles on her cheekbone. The contact was electric. It was permission.

He leaned forward and kissed her.

It was nothing like she’d imagined. It wasn’t aggressive or theatrical. It was deep, searching, overwhelmingly present. His other hand came up to cradle her head, his fingers tangling in her red hair. She tasted the rum on his lips, felt the strength in his hands that were so gentle, and a sound escaped her throat—a gasp of surrender.

When they parted, she was trembling. She turned to look at Sakura, who was watching from the sofa, her face a mask of awe and shared arousal.

“Come here,” Emily breathed.

Sakura rose, a fluid movement, and joined them. Darius watched them both, his chest rising and falling a little faster now. Sakura kissed Emily, a familiar, loving kiss that steadied her. Then, with a boldness that made Emily’s heart stutter, Sakura turned and kissed Darius.

It was the circuit closing. The connection flaring to life.

Darius stood up, breaking the kiss but holding Sakura’s gaze. “The bedroom is through there,” he said, his voice thick. “No one has to do anything they don’t want to.”

“We know,” Sakura said. “We want.”

The bedroom was all shadows and that breathtaking city view, a king-sized bed a dark expanse in the center. The dynamic shifted, the preceding tension melting into a collaborative, feverish exploration. Clothes were not torn, but slowly, mutually, removed. A buckle undone here, a zipper lowered there, each small reveal a shared revelation.

Emily’s breath caught when Darius pulled his shirt over his head. His chest was solid, sculpted not in a gym-obsessed way, but in a way that spoke of natural strength. She reached out, her fingertips touching the skin over his heart, feeling its rapid beat. He was real. This was happening.

They fell onto the bed in a tangle of limbs, a negotiation of touch and breath. Darius’s hands were everywhere, learning them both with a reverence that belied the building heat. He kissed the hollow of Sakura’s throat, the inside of Emily’s wrist. He attended to them with a focus that made Emily feel worshipped, seen in her entirety.

When his fingers traced the waistband of her panties, dipping lower, Emily arched off the bed with a sharp cry. The feeling was too much, too direct after the haze of music and rum. She squirmed, not away, but into the sensation.

“Look at me,” Darius murmured.

She forced her eyes open, met his. His gaze held hers, an anchor, as his touch grew more intimate, deliberate. Sakura was beside her, kissing her shoulder, her hand on Emily’s stomach, a grounding presence.

“I want to see you,” Sakura whispered against her skin. “I want to see you feel it.”

Darius paused, his hand stilling. He looked from Emily’s flushed face to Sakura’s intense one. The question was unspoken but clear.

Emily nodded, a tiny, frantic movement. “Yes.”

He shifted, kneeling between Emily’s legs. In the dim light from the window, she saw him—fully, for the first time. Her academic mind, utterly offline, could only process sensory input. The size, the shape, the sheer physical reality of him sent a new, primal shock through her system. This was the line. The one she’d theorized about, debated, and was now voluntarily, desperately, choosing to cross.

He was patient, agonizingly so, using his hands, his mouth, until she was liquid and pleading. When he finally, slowly, began to press into her, Emily’s world telescoped down to a single, stretching point of sensation. A gasp was torn from her, a sound of overwhelm. It was an invasion, a completion, a surrender all at once. It burned, then it melted, then it filled her utterly.

Sakura was propped on an elbow, watching, her breath catching in sync with Emily’s. Her eyes were dark pools of emotion—love, lust, a fierce, protective pride.

“Oh, God,” Emily choked out, her hands scrabbling against the sheets before finding Darius’s arms. The muscles there were corded tight with restraint.

“Look at her,” Darius said, his voice strained but soft, his eyes locked on Emily’ fight to absorb the feeling. “Look at how she takes it. How beautiful she is.”

Sakura did. She watched every flicker of pain and pleasure on Emily’s face, every tremble of her lip, the frantic rise and fall of her freckled chest. And Emily, held in that dual gaze—Darius’s intense, consuming focus and Sakura’s loving, astonished witness—felt something shatter and reform inside her. This wasn’t just a physical act. It was a transformation.

He began to move, a slow, deep rhythm that stole the air from her lungs. The theoretical was gone. The political was gone. There was only this: the slap of skin, the ragged symphony of their breathing, the city lights winking knowingly beyond the glass, and the utterly new, terrifying, glorious feeling of being full.

Chapter 5 Morning Reverie  
The city outside the window softened from a black tapestry studded with hard diamonds to a deep, bruise-purple, then a wash of charcoal grey. Dawn was a suggestion, not yet a fact. In the long, quiet slide out of intensity, the world felt remade.

Emily lay on her back, the silken sheet cool against the fever-hot skin of her legs. Her body was a map of new sensations—a deep, throbbing ache between her thighs, the phantom memory of full, the pleasant burn of muscles used in unfamiliar ways. Darius was a solid warmth along her right side, one arm flung heavily across her stomach, his breathing deep and even against her neck. On her left, Sakura was curved into her, a leg thrown over Emily’s, her fingertips drawing idle, possessive circles on Emily’s hip.

The hum was still there. Not just in her ears, but in her bones. A residual vibration from the music, from his voice, from the physical shock of him. Her mind, usually a noisy chamber of analysis and critique, was quiet. Hollowed out and peaceful.

Sakura’s lips brushed her shoulder. “You okay?” The whisper was barely audible.

Emily turned her head, her nose brushing Sakura’s hair. It smelled of sex and jasmine and them. “Yeah.” The word was rough, disused. She cleared her throat. “More than okay. I feel… quiet.”

“Good quiet?”

“The best quiet.”

Darius stirred, his arm tightening minutely around her. He nuzzled the junction of her neck and shoulder, his breath warm. No words. Just a hum of his own, a contented sound that resonated through her.

For a long time, there was only the sound of their breathing synchronizing, the distant, lonely wail of a pre-dawn garbage truck, the first tentative chirp of sparrows on the balcony. The light shifted again, painting the room in tones of molten gold and long, stretching shadows. It glinted off the sweat drying on Darius’s shoulder, caught the red in Emily’s hair fanned across the pillow, illuminated the serene intensity on Sakura’s face as she watched them.

Sakura’s hand stilled its circles. Her touch became more deliberate, tracing the line from Emily’s hip, over the gentle curve of her stomach, up to the underside of her breast. It wasn’t a request to restart. It was a re-mapping. A claim.

“I couldn’t stop watching you,” Sakura murmured, her voice still low but losing its sleepy quality. It was sharp with a new kind of hunger. “The look on your face. It was like… wonder. And terror. And total surrender.”

Emily felt a fresh flush spread across her chest. She remembered that dual gaze holding her, the feeling of being the absolute center of two universes.

“It was a lot,” Emily breathed.

“It was beautiful,” Darius said, his voice thick with sleep. He propped himself up on an elbow, looking down at her. His eyes were dark, observant. “You’re beautiful when you’re thinking. You’re breathtaking when you stop.”

The compliment didn’t feel like a line. It felt like a simple statement of fact, and that made it land even deeper. She reached up, touched the stubble on his jaw.

Sakura shifted, rising up on her own elbow so she was looking across Emily at Darius. The dynamic tilted, reformed. The possessive circles on Emily’s skin became a firm, guiding hand.

“I want to see it again,” Sakura said, her eyes not on Emily, but locked on Darius. Her tone was casual, but it crackled in the still air. “Different, this time.”

Darius raised an eyebrow, a silent question.

A small, sly smile played on Sakura’s lips. She leaned closer to Emily, her mouth at her ear. Her whisper was for Emily, but loud enough for Darius to hear. A performance. A directive. “I want to watch you take him in your mouth. I want to see you learn the shape of him.”

A sudden, liquid heat pooled low in Emily’s belly. The quiet in her mind shattered, not into noise, but into a single, focused want. Her theoretical curiosity from weeks ago, the clumsy discussions over cheap wine, crystallized into this moment, this specific, explicit image. Her heart began a slow, heavy rhythm against her ribs.

She looked at Darius. Saw the flare of surprise in his eyes, quickly banked into a smolder. He was waiting. The rule, their only rule, hung in the air between them.

Emily licked her lips. They were dry. “Yeah,” she said, the word a puff of air. “Okay.”

The word was a catalyst. Sakura moved first, sitting up, the sheet falling away. The golden light gilded her skin. She didn’t look away from Darius as she nudged Emily. “Come on. Up.”

It was less an order and more a coaxing, a shared conspiracy. Emily moved, her body sore and pliant, letting Sakura guide her. Darius stayed reclined, propped against the headboard, watching them with a focused stillness. The city was waking up behind him, a silent film playing across the vast window.

Sakura positioned Emily on her knees between Darius’s legs. The intimacy of the pose was profound, vulnerable. Emily’s own nakedness felt acute. Sakura knelt beside her, not touching, just present. A witness. A guide.

“Look at him,” Sakura whispered, her voice a thread of sound. “Don’t think. Just look.”

Emily looked. In the softening dawn light, he was less a statue and more a landscape. All muscle and sinew and quiet power held in check. Her gaze travelled down, her breath catching all over again. This was different. Proximity. Intent.

“Touch him,” Sakura instructed. “Get used to the weight of it.”

Emily’s hand trembled as she reached out. The skin was startlingly soft, the reality beneath it unyielding. She heard Darius’s sharp intake of breath, saw his abdomen tense. This power, her power to elicit that reaction, was a dizzying rush. She wrapped her fingers around him, learning the shape, the heat, the insistent pulse she felt there.

“Now,” Sakura breathed, leaning in closer, her own breath quickening. “Go slow. Let me watch.”

Emily lowered her head. The scent of him—salt, skin, them—filled her senses. Her heart hammered against her sternum. This wasn't about performance. It was about curiosity, about submission, about giving a part of herself she’d never considered giving. It was about pleasing Sakura by surrendering to this.

The first touch of her tongue was tentative, an experiment. The taste was musky, unfamiliar, profoundly intimate. Darius’s hand came down, not to push, but to cradle the back of her head, his fingers tangling gently in her hair. It was an anchor.

“That’s it,” Sakura murmured, her voice husky right by Emily’s ear. “See how he reacts. Take a little more.”

Emily did. She took him into her mouth, the stretch of her jaw a new, strange ache. The reality of it obliterated every vague notion, every crude joke, every clinical description. It was texture, taste, warmth, and a low, guttural sound from Darius that vibrated through her. Sakura’s hand was on her back, rubbing slow circles, a steady, encouraging pressure.

“So good,” Sakura whispered, her own arousal palpable in the tightness of her voice. “Look at you. My brave, beautiful girl. Taking him so well.”

The praise was a fuel. Emily found a rhythm, guided by the slight pressure of Darius’s hand, by the soft, choked sounds he made, by Sakura’s whispered commentary painting a picture she couldn’t see but could feel. She was the connection between them, the instrument they were playing in tandem. The power had transformed again; it was in her control, in her willingness, in the absolute trust that hummed between the three of them.

She lost track of time, lost in the sensory feedback loop. The ache in her jaw, the weight on her tongue, the sound of Sakura’s accelerating breath, the tightening of Darius’s thighs beneath her hands.

His grip in her hair tightened, a gentle warning. “Em… Emily.” Her name was a strained plea.

She didn’t pull away. She met his gaze, her eyes watering, and held it. She saw the shock there, the overwhelming pleasure, the profound respect. It was the final surrender, and it was hers to give.

After, as she collapsed back onto the sheets, the taste of him still on her lips, Sakura was there. She kissed Emily, deep and searching, a kiss of shared triumph. “Incredible,” Sakura breathed against her mouth. “You were incredible.”

Darius gathered them both, pulling them into the cradle of his arms. They were a tangle of spent limbs, salty skin, and rapid heartbeats slowly calming. The first true ray of sun broke over the skyline, a brilliant blade of gold that sliced across the bed, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air, the sheen of sweat on their bodies.

No one spoke. The silence was full. Emily lay with her head on Darius’s chest, listening to the strong, steady beat of his heart. Sakura’s arm was draped across them both.

In the clear, unforgiving morning light, there were no more shadows to hide in. The theory was gone. The list was ashes. All that remained was this: her body, fundamentally altered; her relationship, stretched into a new, terrifying shape; and a quiet, dawning realization that the person she was when she arrived here last night was gone. Someone new was lying in this tangle of sheets, and she had no name for her yet.",1,1767267491.0,u_Sufficient-Pirate-15,0,1.0,False

The contrast between India’s North and South serves as the sensory backdrop for Arvind and Vibha’s story. In **Delhi**, the atmosphere is defined by ""fiery"" intensity—brutal sunlight, metallic dust storms, and the persistent roar of Punjabi beats and honking horns. This environment, rich with the smell of street tandoors and the sight of glowing red sandstone, shaped Arvind with a sense of grit and passion. In contrast, **Bangalore** offers a ""watery,"" mellow refuge for Vibha. The ""Garden City"" is characterized by soft light filtering through rain trees, the fragrance of jasmine and filter coffee, and a rhythmic blend of traditional looms and modern tech parks that fostered her calm poise.

As modern India evolves into a cultural melting pot, these distinct worlds are increasingly intersecting. Driven by the tech boom and digital connectivity, the younger generation is blending old-world roots with new-age ambitions. ""The Unexpected Click"" captures this fusion, illustrating how a stormy night can bridge the gap between two people from polar opposite backgrounds. It is a narrative of balance, showing that the clash of cultures—much like a breakfast table featuring both parathas and idlis—can create a contemporary identity that is richer and more vibrant than its individual parts.",1,1767267270.0,digitalpolymath,0,1.0,False

Recently though I made a mistake and ordered a bag of whole beans and so figured it was time to get a grinder, but I think in doing so I might have broken my unit?

In hindsight I can see that you probably want to go from coarse to fine when dialling in, but I went with the finest setting first. I prepared a puck and all that and then mounted and flicked the switch and…..nothing. Nothing got though. I made another a few clicks less fine on my grinder and again nothing.

Then I went for a much more coarse grind and alarmingly also got nothing coming through, plus a weird new sound and what looked like steam rising out of the top of the unit. Not good.

When I flip the switch without anything in the head no water comes out now. I fear starting with too fine a ground caused something in the system to pop. There’s plenty of water in the tank.

Does anybody have any tips on where I can start to diagnose things? I’m pretty comfortable with electronics work, but taking it to a repair place would be fine too, if there are any reliable ones in the London area.

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the marquette golden eagles game at the al mcguire center on 01/04 at 3:00 pm. that saturday afternoon tip-off means the official spots are going to fill up super fast, and the traffic around 12th street right before the game will be a mess if you're not smart about it.  
  
first thing's first, check out Prked. honestly, this is the insider way to do it. it's an app where people near campus rent out their driveways or garages for the day, and it's usually way cheaper than the official lots. the best part is you can find a spot a block or two away, completely skip the long line of cars trying to get into the main structure, and just stroll over. short walk, big time saver, and you're not battling that wells street traffic.  
  
if you want the official route, the designated spectator parking is the wells street parking structure, which is also called structure 2. it’s at 1240 w. wells st., just one block west of the al mcguire center. the typical game day rate is around $10 for event parking, but definitely have a credit card or some cash ready in case they change it at the gate. if you're aiming for this one, you really need to be there by 2:15 pm—at least 45 minutes before the 3:00 pm tip-off—to avoid the worst of the rush and secure a spot before it hits capacity.  
  
a slightly longer but often more guaranteed option is to use a pre-booking app like spothero or parkwhiz to grab a downtown garage spot. look for places like the macarthur square garage (841 n james lovell st) or the trinity church lot (1075 n 8th st). these are only about a 9 to 13-minute walk and sometimes they have better flat event rates than the on-campus garages, especially if structure 2 is full.  
  
the last resort is street parking, and it's always tricky in milwaukee. you can find metered spots on 12th street and adjacent streets, but you have to check every single sign carefully. the main rule for a saturday afternoon is the posted hourly limit—you absolutely do not want to get a ticket for overstaying your welcome. since the game is during the day, you don’t need to worry about the alternate side parking rules, but never park somewhere without clearly reading the signs. they are sneaky around campus.  
  
get there early, maybe grab a coffee and stroll over. hope this helps you enjoy the game!",1,1767266552.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

The Journey of Karl Heinrich Müller: A Settler’s Tale in Neugranada-Venezuela
In the year 1887, amid the bustling ports of Hamburg in the newly unified German Empire, a young man named Karl Heinrich Müller bid farewell to his native North Germany. At twenty-four years of age, Karl hailed from the Hanseatic city of Bremen, where he had apprenticed as a brewer in his family’s modest establishment. Economic pressures from industrialization and a sense of adventure, fueled by colonial society pamphlets extolling the opportunities in the Kaiserliche Provinz Neugranada-Venezuela, compelled him to seek a new life across the Atlantic. Subsidized passage on a steamship bound for the Caribbean port of La Guaira marked the beginning of his emigration.
The voyage lasted several weeks, during which Karl shared cramped quarters with fellow settlers from Prussia, Bavaria, and the Rhineland.

Upon disembarking in the humid tropics, Karl marveled at the dramatic shift from the flat North German plains to the towering Andes. Assigned land through the provincial settlement program, he journeyed inland by mule train to the highlands near the expanding Colonia Tovar, a German enclave in the Venezuelan cordilleras.

There, amid mist-shrouded mountains and fertile valleys, he established a small farm, cultivating barley and hops alongside traditional coffee bushes—a crop that promised integration into the province’s thriving export economy.

Karl’s early years were marked by hardship: adapting to the altitude, learning basic Spanish from Creole neighbors, and constructing a half-timbered house reminiscent of his homeland, adapted with wider eaves to withstand tropical rains.

It was during the annual Hochlandfest in 1892 that Karl encountered a profound cultural artifact of the province’s emerging hybrid identity. The festival, held in a meadow overlooking the colony, combined Bavarian traditions with local harvest celebrations: brass bands played oompah music, while llanero harps accompanied dances.

Amid the revelry, a traveling troupe from Bismarckstadt performed excerpts from the renowned Andenlied Cycle, the epic poems by Heinrich Vargas that wove Teutonic mythology with Andean legends. Karl, seated among fellow settlers and Creole families, listened raptly as reciters in traditional attire narrated tales of knights traversing enchanted mountains, guided by indigenous spirits. The illuminated manuscript pages, passed briefly among the audience for admiration, featured intricate illustrations blending Gothic script with pre-Columbian motifs. This experience deepened Karl’s appreciation for the cultural synthesis unfolding in the province, inspiring him to contribute verses in the emerging Deutsch-Kreolisch dialect.

Over time, Karl prospered, marrying a daughter of mixed German-Creole heritage and expanding his brewery to produce a lager infused with local cacao. His life exemplified the transformative migration that shaped Neugranada-Venezuela, bridging European discipline with South American vitality in the late imperial era.",0,1767266150.0,victoria3,9,0.09,False

Chapter 1: The Labour of the Larvae

     The floorboards of the Ossuary Suite tasted like dust and the lingering ghost of a Le Labo candle. Phee pressed her cheek against the cold, scuffed wood, watching a dust mote dance in a sliver of grey Dalston light. Her silk slip, a vintage find that had definitely seen more glamorous breakdowns, was hiked up to her hips.
     A low, vibrating thrum started somewhere behind her pubic bone. It wasn't the usual dull ache of a period; it was a G-sharp, resonant and clean. Then a second note joined it—a perfect third above—and finally, a fifth, creating a haunting, rhythmic chord that made the discarded cigarette packs on the floor rattle.
     ""It's the tonic resonance of the room, surely.""
     Julian stood in the doorway of the kitchenette, holding a chipped mug of herbal tea like it was a holy relic. His suit was four sizes too large, the charcoal wool hanging off his frame in a way that screamed 'post-structuralist fatigue'. He didn't look at Phee, who was currently vibrating on the floor. He looked at the peeling wallpaper.
     ""I'm gestating a choir, Julian. My uterus is currently performing a chamber piece, and you're talking about acoustics?""
     Phee's voice was a gravelly rasp. She tried to roll onto her back, but the harmony intensified, a literal physical weight shifting inside her. The chord changed to a minor key.
     ""Art is never about the literal, Ophelia. You're projecting your internalised dissatisfaction with our shared narrative onto your biological functions. It's very 19th-century. Very 'The Yellow Wallpaper'. I find the commitment to the bit quite refreshing, actually.""
     ""The 'bit' is currently trying to harmonise with the hum of the fridge. Get me the gin. The one in the cupboard, not the one you hide in your boot.""
     Julian sighed, a sound that contained at least three footnotes. He moved with a deliberate, slow-motion grace toward the cupboard, stepping over a pile of half-finished poetry journals and a pair of crusty Doc Martens.
     ""We discussed the gin. It's a dehydrator of the soul. You need to lean into the discomfort. Let the somatic experience inform your output. Are you recording this? The frequency is fascinating. It's almost... industrial.""
     ""I'm not recording my own agony for your next B-side, you pretentious prick. It feels like someone is knitting a sweater out of electrified wire inside my cervix.""
     The three-part harmony reached a crescendo. Phee's back arched, her fingers clawing at the floorboards. The sound wasn't just in her head anymore; it was filling the studio, bouncing off the empty bottle of 2014 Chardonnay that sat like a tombstone on the coffee table. The air in the flat grew thick, humid, and smelled suddenly of overripe peaches and ozone.
     Julian peered over his tea, adjusting his glasses.
     ""The olfactory element is a bold choice. Is that a pomegranate accord? It's very Persephone. Very 'descent into the underworld via Shoreditch High Street'.""
     ""Julian, shut up. Seriously. Shut the fuck up.""
     Phee's breath came in ragged hitches. The rhythm of the humming intensified, turning into a frantic, buzzing pulse. It felt like a heartbeat, but too fast. A thousand heartbeats.
     ""You're always so hostile to the process,"" Julian said, leaning against the doorframe. ""This is why the ritual in the basement failed to provide the closure you sought. You were looking for an ending, but I told you, Phee—narratives don't end. They merely dissolve into new states of being. You're currently dissolving. It's quite poetic, if you could just get over the 'me, me, me' of the pain.""
     ""The ritual failed because you insisted on reading your own lyrics instead of the incantations, you ego-bloated vulture!""
     Phee let out a guttural scream as a sharp, crystalline prick sliced through her internal lining. It wasn't a tear; it was a puncture. The harmony shattered into a chaotic, high-pitched swarm of sound.
     From beneath the hem of her silk slip, a tiny, iridescent spark flickered.
     It wasn't a spark. It was a wing.
     A single fly, the size of a thumb-tack and the colour of a bruised emerald, crawled out from the shadow of her thigh. It didn't buzz like a common housefly; it sang. It emitted a single, perfect note of the three-part harmony, its wings vibrating with such intensity they blurred into a halo of green light.
     Phee stared at it, her eyes wide, her breath catching in her throat.
     ""Oh, God. Julian. Look.""
     Julian didn't move. He took a slow sip of his tea, his eyes tracking the insect as it circled Phee's ankle.
     ""A Diptera. Fascinating. And it's… iridescent. You've birthed a visual metaphor, Ophelia. It's almost too on the nose, isn't it? The fly in the ointment. The decay at the heart of the domestic. Is this your way of telling me you've found my latest lyrics… derivative?""
     Phee sat up, the pain suddenly replaced by a terrifying, hollow lightness. The fly landed on her knee, its tiny legs tickling her skin. It looked at her with multifaceted eyes that seemed to hold a reflected glitter of her own reflection.
     ""It's a fly, Julian. A real, actual, biological fly just came out of my body. This isn't a poem. It's a medical emergency. Or a biblical one.""
     ""Don't be so dramatic. It's clearly a manifestation of the 'Damp' philosophy we discussed. You've always been so obsessed with the tactile, the humid, the rot. This is just your subconscious taking a physical form. It's quite a compliment to my influence on your psyche, really. I've always said that our love was a breeding ground for something… transformative.""
     ""Our love was a breeding ground for thrush and debt, nothing else.""
     Phee reached out a trembling hand. The fly didn't fly away. It crawled onto her fingertip and began to hum. It was a sweet, mournful sound, like a tiny ballad played through a tin can.
     ""Look at it, Julian. It's beautiful. And it's… it's me. I can feel it. There's a string. A red string.""
     Julian set his mug down on a stack of Moleskines. He walked over and knelt beside her, though he kept a careful six inches of 'intellectual distance'.
     ""The Invisible String theory. Very populist. Very romantic. But tell me, Phee, is the fly a critique of my absence, or a celebration of your own newfound agency? Because if it's the latter, the emerald hue is a bit derivative of my 'Green Room' period, don't you think?""
     Phee looked from the fly to Julian's face. He looked genuinely curious, the way a scientist looks at a particularly interesting mould growth. There was no concern. No fear. Just a desperate, clawing need to frame her trauma within the context of his own brilliance.
     ""I'm bleeding insects, Julian. My womb is a terrarium. And you're worried about your fucking 'Green Room' period?""
     ""I'm simply trying to help you navigate the semiotics of the situation. Without a framework, you're just a girl with a pest problem. With my analysis, you're a living installation. You're art, Phee. You should be thanking me for the inspiration.""
     The fly on Phee's finger suddenly changed its tune. The hum turned into a sharp, aggressive buzz. It took flight, circling Julian's head with a sound like a tiny, angry chainsaw.
     ""It doesn't like you,"" Phee whispered, a strange, dark smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.
     ""It's a manifestation of your repressed anger. It's understandable. My presence is often a catalyst for intense emotional reckoning. It's the weight of the footnotes, I suspect. Most people find my intellectual depth… suffocating.""
     Julian batted at the fly with a limp hand. The insect dodged him with ease, its iridescent wings flashing in the grey light.
     ""You're not deep, Julian. You're just a puddle in an oversized suit. You're the reason I went to that basement. You're the reason I drank that cursed wine. You've dehydrated me for three years, and now… now I'm the Bringer of the Damp.""
     ""That's a bit much, even for you. 'Bringer of the Damp'? It sounds like a bad indie band from Bristol. Let's stick to the metaphor. The fly represents the ephemeral nature of our connection. It's a memento mori. A reminder that even in the height of summer, the maggot is always—""
     Julian stopped. His eyes widened.
     From beneath Phee's slip, three more flies emerged. Then ten. Then a dozen. They didn't crawl this time; they erupted in a silent, shimmering cloud of emerald and gold. The three-part harmony returned, but now it was a full orchestral swell, a vibrating wall of sound that made the windows of the Dalston studio rattle in their frames.
     ""Ophelia?""
     Julian backed away, his oversized trousers swishing against the floor. The tea in his mug sloshed over the rim.
     ""The metaphor is getting a bit… crowded,"" he stammered, his voice losing its academic cool. ""Is this part of the performance? Because the logistics of cleaning this up are going to be a nightmare for the deposit.""
     Phee stood up. She felt powerful. She felt like a goddess come to life, all wet lace and ancient rage. The swarm circled her, a halo of singing insects that blurred her silhouette.
     ""The deposit, Julian? You're worried about the landlord?""
     ""Gary is very particular about the walls, Phee! And if those things start laying eggs in the plaster, he'll have my head. I'm the one on the lease, remember? I took the fiscal responsibility so you could focus on your 'vibe'.""
     ""You took the lease so you could control the locks.""
     Phee stepped toward him. The flies followed, a humming extension of her own will. They began to settle on the walls, the furniture, the empty wine bottles. They didn't leave spots; they left tiny, shimmering flecks of glitter-rot that smelled like jasmine and decay.
     ""I think you should leave, Julian.""
     ""Leave? In the middle of a conceptual breakthrough? Don't be absurd. We need to document this. I have my Leica in the bag. If we frame this correctly, we could get a spread in Vice. 'The Girl Who Bests Flies: A Post-Modern Plague'. It's gold, Phee. It's the comeback I've been waiting for.""
     ""The comeback you've been waiting for?""
     Phee's hand went to her foot. She wasn't wearing shoes, but her heavy, salt-stained leather boot was lying right there on the floorboards, a relic of her walk home from the pub the night before.
     ""I'm birthing a biblical plague, and you're looking for a press release.""
     ""I'm looking for the truth, Ophelia! The flies are just the medium. I am the message. Without my interpretation, you're just a girl in a messy flat with a hygiene issue. You need me to tell the world what this means.""
     Julian reached out, as if to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, his face shifting into that practiced, 'tortured artist' expression of empathy.
     ""You're so beautiful when you're infested. It's very Pre-Raphaelite. Very Millais. Let me just get the lighting right.""
     Phee didn't think. She didn't weigh the semiotics. She didn't check the footnotes.
     She grabbed the boot.
     It was heavy, caked in London grit and the memory of a dozen sticky club floors. She swung it with the full weight of her three-year hangover, her unrequited feelings, and the vibrating energy of the swarm.
     The boot caught Julian square in the chest.
     The air left his lungs in a wheezing puff. He stumbled back, his tea mug flying from his hand and shattering against the 2014 Chardonnay bottle. The tea splashed over his oversized lapels, staining the wool a muddy brown.
     ""Ow! Phee! That's… that's actual physical violence! That's not part of the discourse!""
     ""The discourse is over, Julian! The flies are the only ones talking now!""
     The swarm reacted to her anger, their hum rising to a deafening, dissonant shriek. They surged toward Julian, a cloud of emerald teeth and singing wings. He let out a very un-indie yelp and scrambled toward the door, his oversized suit jacket flapping like a wounded bird.
     ""You're unhinged! This isn't art! It's… it's a public health hazard!""
     He fumbled with the locks, his fingers shaking. The flies hovered inches from his face, their multifaceted eyes reflecting his terror.
     ""Tell the world what it means, Julian!"" Phee shouted, her voice ringing out over the buzz. ""Tell them it means I'm done being your fucking muse!""
     Julian finally wrenched the door open. He didn't look back. He sprinted down the hallway of the council block, his footsteps echoing against the linoleum.
     ""I'll send you the bill for the dry cleaning!"" his voice drifted back, thin and desperate.
     Phee stood in the centre of the Ossuary Suite, her chest heaving, the boot still clutched in her hand. The silence that followed was heavy, humid, and thick with the smell of jasmine.
     Slowly, the flies returned to her. They didn't go back inside; they settled on her shoulders, her hair, the hem of her slip. They began to hum again—a soft, melodic lullaby in three-part harmony.
     Phee looked down at her finger. The Alpha Fly, the first one, was still there. It cleaned its tiny legs and looked up at her.
     ""Zzz-slay,"" it whispered.
     Phee dropped the boot. She walked over to the fridge, her bare feet sticking slightly to the floorboards. She pulled out a bottle of cheap, warm Chardonnay, cracked the screwcap, and took a long, vibrating pull.
     ""Right,"" she muttered, the wine burning pleasantly in her throat. ""First things first. I need a better playlist.""
     The flies began to hum the bridge to a song. Phee sat down on the floor, surrounded by her shimmering, singing children, and for the first time in three years, she felt like the smartest person in the room.
     The wallpaper continued to peel. The bin still needed taking out. But the air was damp, the swarm was hungry, and the Grand Buzz was just beginning.
     Phee leaned her head back against the wall and closed her eyes, letting the vibration of the insects sync with her own heartbeat.
     ""Masterpiece,"" she whispered to the empty room. ""I'm a fucking masterpiece.""

      ""Nice aim with the boot, miss,"" the ghost whispered, her voice a high-pitched echo of the flies. ""He had a very punchable aura.""
     Phee didn't even open her eyes. She just raised her glass to the ceiling.
     ""He had it coming, Clem. He really, really did.""
     The flies took up the refrain, a thousand tiny voices singing in perfect, iridescent unison. The Ossuary Suite wasn't just an apartment anymore. It was a hive. And Phee was finally home.

The kitchen area was tiny, barely enough counter space for a coffee maker, and definitely no room for a full-sized refrigerator. I started researching very small refrigerators that could fit in a compact space but still hold enough food for one person.
The options ranged from mini-fridges that could barely hold a week of groceries to slightly larger compact refrigerators with actual freezer sections. I needed something that could fit under my counter but was large enough that I was not grocery shopping every other day. Finding that balance was trickier than expected.
I ended up ordering a compact model from Alibaba that fit perfectly in my space and held more than I anticipated. Living with it has made me realize how much food I used to waste with a full-sized fridge. When you have limited space, you buy only what you need and actually use everything before it expires. My parents think my tiny fridge is sad and that I am living like a college student. But honestly, it fits my lifestyle better than a huge refrigerator ever did. Does living in smaller spaces actually force you to live more efficiently, or am I just justifying my situation?

Hi everyone, I need some advice on something I (27F) went through with my girlfriend (25F). We are a fairly new couple, only have been dating for 6 months but known each other for 8. A few months ago, my sister passed away, pretty early on into our relationship. I'm bringing this up because in my first outing since she passed (I felt very anxious being out in the world) I went to a city with my girlfriend and her co workers. My girlfriend's behaviour did not sit right with me during this. We usually sit next to each other at restaurants, which I would've liked since I was anxious, but she sat next to her co worker.. okay whatever. Well, mid way through lunch, this co worker put her arm behind my girlfriend (not totally behind her, but rested it on the bench they were seated on) and this made me really uncomfortable. Later, we went to get coffee, and my girlfriend and this co worker left together and were so caught up in conversation that she didn't even realize she had left me behind at the cafe. In the weeks leading up to this and after, my girlfriend constantly brought this person up in conversation. If something would remind her of them, she would tell me, or just talk about them a lot in general. She would also watch her social media stories and what not constantly around me. Also while I was with my sister in the hospital, this co worker told my girlfriend about how I was just ""leading her on"" and that our relationship was going no where. My girlfriend never told me she said this until weeks later. I know I should've mentioned this to my girlfriend sooner, but I thought I was being insecure so I decided not to. One morning, she kept musing over how she just knew said co worker had a crush on someone. Finally, I lost it and just asked her bluntly if she liked her co worker, and why she would care if she had a crush, etc. We had our first argument over this and she got upset with me for believing she could ever like someone that wasn't me. We made up and weeks later the co worker found out about this through a mutual friend my girlfriend confided in, and blocked me on social media (including the mutual friend.) My girlfriend said it was messed up that they would do this, and how she would unfollow them too and not associate with them any longer. Well, this was a complete lie. She continued staying friends with them, just hiding her social media notifications from me of things they'd send her. The other day I saw that my girlfriend had liked this co worker's new post and even commented on it complimenting how she looked. I confronted my girlfriend about this and she told me that the co worker ""approached her at work and made her like and comment on her post"" and that she didn't want to make things awkward so she did it anyway. After all of these things, I am left feeling hurt and disrespected. I feel like my girlfriend acted questionably towards this person and repeatedly disrespected our relationship and crossed boundaries I had set, putting this person's feelings above my own. I know I should break up with her, it just hurts so bad. I really love my girlfriend and I know she loves me, but I can't tolerate being disrespected like this constantly. 😭",4,1767265675.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
1q11tfn,https://www.reddit.com/r/spirituality/comments/1q11tfn/10_things_that_make_me_happy/,10 things that make me happy,"For me, happiness is not about everything being good, but about being in contact with what is real. Here are ten things that make me happy, and why.
	
1.	Moments of inner stillness
When my thoughts quiet down a little and I stop trying to improve or figure out life. Just being in it. It brings a deep, bodily sense of relief.
	
2.	Honest conversations
When I can speak without playing a role, and the other person does the same. Authenticity creates connection, and connection beats loneliness.
	
3.	Embodied presence
Walking, movement, breathing. When I am in my body instead of stuck in my head, a lot of unnecessary suffering drops away.
	
4.	Understanding something deeply
Not facts, but insight. When something truly clicks and the world becomes a little clearer.
	
5.	Creating
Writing, shaping thoughts, giving words to what would otherwise remain a vague inner pressure. Creation is ordered relief.
	
6.	Nature’s indifference
The sea, the forest, the sky. Nature does not care about my problems, and that is exactly why it calms me.
	
7.	Saying no in time
Boundaries are underrated. Every honest no creates more life force than ten half-hearted yeses.
	
8.	Small everyday rituals
Coffee in silence. The same chair. The same morning light. Simplicity creates stability.
	
9.	Seeing through illusions
When I notice that something I was worried about was just a thought. Clarity brings freedom.
	
10.	Not running from what hurts
It sounds paradoxical, but much of my happiness comes from no longer avoiding discomfort. Resistance costs more than pain.

For me, happiness is not a constant state. It is the absence of unnecessary resistance to life as it actually is.

Chapter 1.



The sound of muffled conversation could be heard within the break room. Unlike the rest of the office, there was something… pleasing about it. Unlike the somewhat bleak white walls and bland flooring, damaged with gum and shoe mud, the room is clean. With a vivid red carpet, fridge and a side table, with a kettle, coffee machine and different pots aligned neatly upon it. The conversation has come from 2 young men. Well, one young man and a robot. Or a drone as you may call it. Despite its threatening appearance, with a railgun for an arm and a spiked tail, it's quite friendly. And dresses so. With a nicely brushed head of silver hair and a dark neat trench coat. And his speech, a thick hearty British accent veils it. Many call him A although his mate calls him “Ayer” whether he likes it or not.



Chatting to him is the man himself, Banagher links. Unlike A, his hair is a complete mess. With only a few minor attempts at brushing shown. He’s adorned in a business suit, showing the signs of a true office worker. Despite the fact nobody else in this place wears anything like office attire. He also carries a bit of a British accent. albeit, slightly weaker. The conversation between the unlikely duo breaks into laughter.



**A**: “…And i said, hey! That hair of yours ain’t going to look more like a jungle than Mr Links!”



(The two chuckle, and keep chatting. They have plenty of time. A goes serious to ask a question.)



**A**: “Say mate. I’ve been thinking about something. Don’t you have any close family?”



(Banagher opens his mouth, about to answer, but nothing comes. He instead starts to think. Before replying…)



**Banagher:** “I… don’t really know to be honest. I… I…”



**A**: “you just appeared? I bet that's what you were going to say. You won’t stop talking about it. Your previous memories are false.” (for anyone who does not understand the Banagher lore, Banagher is a clone of a well known person from the past. I mentioned this in a lore post but i can understand if it was not seen.)



“You know, you should do some research… y’know. I saw something on the news. In fact, I thought of you for once and decided to put it on my phone. Take a gander mate.



Flicking through some videos and finding the report, A skips to the section and shows it to Banagher. The quality is… somewhat low quality. Maybe because he saw it on the TV and decided to record the TV itself.

**Newscaster**: “Today on interplanet news, the wreckage of an ancient space colony from the human era of UC has been drifting through the void and was discovered entering one of the far off mining Solar systems. Judging from its current speed moving through space, it is predicted to fly close to Copper 9, before the gravity and speed slingshots it back into the void. Despite its importance in human history, its access to the public has been blocked off by the military. Bacteria from the UC era is much more different than the bacteria we know today due to the passage of time and may mean that our current medicine will not cure it. Updates will come in soon-”



**A**: “Everyone knows that “illness” stuff is Bullsh\*t. If your body is fine with our bacteria then your bacteria should be fine with us. But I'm not a drone so who am I to judge? It's probably some weapon testing stuff. I just thought that if this is from the era you claim to be from, it might interest you.”



Although skeptical, it sounds like a good place to start… with a skip in his step, Banagher rushes for the door.



**A**: “Hey! Where the hell do you think you're going!?”



**Banagher:** To the spaceport! Tell my manager that I'm using my off-work days!



**A**: ""But you can’t just take a shuttle there! Can’t you hear? The Military are all over it! And you already used your off-work days you bloomin idiot!”



**Banagher**: “And let this moment pass? Na-da! And also, I will owe you $20 if you save my arse from the manager's wrath!”



**A**: “YOU ALREADY OWE ME $20-”



But it's too late, Banagher has already vanished down the hall, pushing past a few workers and launching himself over the reception barrier. In such a rush that he skips the elevator entirely and makes his way down the fire escape.



**Clover**: “Gee. Whatz hiz Problem today? Out of coffee beanz already? I doubt there are any other reasonz for him to be running like the devil iz on his tail.”



**A**: “Bro. not everyone has a tail.”



**Clover**: “Figure of zpeech you idiot.”



The two argue, failing to notice the shifting plant pot inside the break room. But it's no plant pot. And emerging from within, is none other than the detective looking man, Pixelmon. With his classic drip and a killer mustache. (Maybe the biggest mystery is if the mustache is fake.) Nobody notices the ever so silent man, with the grace of a swan (above the water or below the water, you decide.) he pushes open the window and leaps out. Pulling the cord on his bag and deploying his parachute. Slowly flying towards the slightly smaller building nearby. There, he’s caught by two men and taken inside. Into a room. Empty aside from a table, a chair and a telephone. So non-chalantly, he picks up the telephone.



**Pixelmon**: “You do realize you can just use a mobile phone right?”



From the other side of the line, a low voice can be heard…



**???**: “Don’t question it. Moving onto more important stuff, we already heard what they said over your wire. So there is this colony approaching Copper 9 correct? And it's locked down by the army? I say. It sounds like there may be something the public doesn’t know… you know what that means right?



**Pixelmon**: “Yes boss… we are following the guy ain’t we?”



**JCJ Director**: “Don’t take the words out my Damn mouth.



**Pixelmon**: “Alright. It’ll be done sir.”



**JCJ Director**: “Before you hang up, we have this professional. Expert in… not so office worthy tasks. He’s had an interest in this sort of stuff for a while. He will be joining you at the spaceport. That's all.”



**Pixelmon**: “Understood sir.”

https://preview.redd.it/jfmpy240zpag1.jpg?width=1905&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2f83cd3134c330c4a18649987d7209cde828cd3d

If you run a POD Shopify store and aren’t using email flows, you’re leaving SERIOUS money on the table.

I know this because I did exactly that. Once orders started coming in, I got comfortable. Ads were working, money was hitting the account, and I honestly got lazy. I started spending more, traveling a bit, enjoying the wins, and telling myself I’d “optimize later.” Email marketing felt like extra work that could wait. Big mistake. I didn’t realize how much money I was leaking every single day just because I wasn’t following up with people who had already shown interest in my store.

That’s when it hit me. I wasn’t losing customers because my products were bad. I was losing them because I wasn’t showing up again after their first interaction. Once I finally set up proper email flows, the difference was stupidly obvious. Revenue jumped without increasing ad spend, and that’s when I realized how powerful this stuff actually is.

  
However, still a lot of people don't know when you should actually use it. You can easily make $k5-$10k from email flows. I do not advise **cold** email marketing for ecommerce stores but only **email flows (or automations).** Your primary source of traffic has to be something else, which can be Facebook, google ads, seo or anything else. You can expect email marketing to bring in an extra 30% of revenue on top of revenue which you are already doing. In some cases, we even saw upto 60% more revenue. So it doesn't have to be said that if you aren't using email marketing, you are leaving money out on the table.

Email automation (or email flows) is this process of automating email marketing upon a certain trigger (or action). For e.g

When a visitors take certain actions on your website, that's when you should do email marketing. For e.g someone left a cart without buying (**Abandoned Cart Flows**)? Email them about it. Someone bought a product ? Ask them for a review. **(Review Request Series)** If they left a positive review ? Upsell them **(After review series) ,** etc.

Most of it, however, is hard to understand.  And even harder to implement. For the last 4 years, I have been heavily involved with Ecommerce. I have done about 1.5 million in sales from my own stores and worked with a lot of clients *(doing about upto USD 3 million per year)* for their email marketing. And each time I faced many issues which not only took weeks to implement but required a lot of reading through the documentation of different apps to integrate them. For e.g

1. **If you want to do review request emails you might need use loox or stamped.** You will have to separately pay for them of course
2. **Want to send something standard like abandoned cart emails ?** Great, **install klaviyo**, mailchimp or some other app. You will start for free but be ready to pay upwards of 100s of dollars once you start making consistent sales.
3. **Want to implement** **'After review series' ?** Good, you just learnt that the review app you installed doesn't have apis to integrate with klaviyo. So uninstall it, setup a new review app and then figure out a way how to integrate their apis together so you can send them.
4. **Want to integrate popups and discount codes?** Use a different **app** like **privy** and design the emails there again.
5. **Want to use chats?** There are many **apps** like **tidio**, intercom etc. Once again, pay for them separately and design the emails again for chat transcripts and follow ups.
6. **Maintaining a consistent brand was not only a nightmare but impossible.** Because all these apps/tools are from different providers, we had to use different email builders. Imagine uploading your logo, brand colors, signatures to 10 different apps if you just want to get started with email marketing. Then you have to play with their settings and design the emails. **Even when everything is consistent, your design ends up looking different** for each of these flows because of a separate builder being used. I
7. **A lot of templates** these providers have, are useless. They will almost **always land in spam or promotions tab**. You get tempted with those fancy looking templates but if you start sending them, thats when you will know how useless they are. Why? Because they have a lot of images and html content. And that's why they look fancy. You might ask why would they even provide these templates if they go to spam ? Honestly, I do not blame them. They sell what an average joe demands. But you have to remember, \*Higher the amount of HTML in your email, higher the chance of it going to spam. So we tried to keep the html and image content low. And of course, there are also many technical factors like Sender’s ip reputation, SPF & DKIM signatures etc.\***Imagine spending months designing emails and your customers can't even read them. And you end up again spending months trying to figure out why.**
8. **Then comes the price.** All these prices add up and even though many of them have free plans, once you start getting even a few orders, be ready to pay upwords of $100. In almost all cases we saw Klaviyo alone costing us upwards of $1000. On some stores our clients paid over $3000. Once you start growing, that's when you realize how much money these apps actually cost. It felt outrageous paying that amount but it's too late to do anything because setting these flows up takes a lot of time.

We ended up being so frustrated that we started using our own inhouse tools to get these things done.

**Anyways.** 

We tested a bunch of email flows, but these 8 kept bringing in most of the revenue:

1. **Review Request (3 emails):** Simple way to collect more reviews without asking manually.
2. **Post-Review + Upsell (5 emails):** If someone leaves a review, it’s the perfect time to suggest another product.
3. **Cart Abandonment (3 emails):** Classic, but still one of the highest ROI flows.
4. **Welcome Series (2 emails):** Quick intro after signup so people actually remember the brand.
5. **Order Placed Thank You (1 email):** A little confirmation + thank you goes a long way.
6. **Order Fulfilled Thank You (1 email):** Nice touch once the package is on the way.
7. **Popup Follow-up (3 emails):** For people who dropped their email in a popup — keeps them engaged.
8. **Chat Transcript (1 email):** If someone chatted, send them the convo so they don’t forget.

A chronic illness that makes an individual slowly looses their entropy 

According to Firefly, a person afflicted with Entropy Loss Syndrome will slowly begin to fade away. In the early stages, a person can still do common menial tasks. Over time, it gets worse as the person will begin to slow down until ***the boundary between their body and the world becomes blurry.***

The statement is very unclear, what does boundary between the body and the world has anything to do with entropy? I dont trust that kiddo. Unless.........its just a metaphor......

But first, we have to know what entropy is

In simple terms, entropy is the natural tendency of things to move from order to disorder, or for energy to spread out and become less useful, like a tidy room naturally becoming messy or a hot cup of coffee cooling down as its heat disperses. It's a measure of randomness, the number of ways energy can be arranged, or the unavailability of energy to do work, and the universe always moves towards higher entropy

Or simply, more mess = more entropy , less mess = less entropy



 entropy can decrease , but the outside entropy have to increase. Everything has entropy therefore it can increase or decrease freely,but the universe is a closed system which practically has no outside, therefore the universe's entropy cannot decrease, only increase or stays the same.......

.


I think i got carried away


Anyway, what im saying is that the kiddo is basically getting ""colder""(getting closer to absolute zero) so she's getting slower because she's approaching absolute zero, think of the situation like this:

Everyone is like a water bottle that has a small hole around 6 cm above the bottom of the bottle ,normally the water(entropy) flows out the hole , but the hole is small , you can replenish the water easily and it can never fully ran out , because the hole isn't at the bottom (normally you can't reach absolute zero, the closer you get, the longer it takes)

But for the kiddo,

The hole is bigger , and its at the bottom of the bottle,she cant replenish the water enough and it will run out. Reaching absolute zero, where she just stops, like stop entirely , dead. I am so interested on how did the glamothian managed to achieve absolute zero , but now we have to focus on the current 

Well, the situation seems like a dead end untill you realise, all you have to do is pour more water into the bottle untill we can make the leak smaller well, in this case , fire 

Adding heat to the system will increase the entropy, its the easiest way how? You may ask, simple, S.A.M 

The glamothian already thought about this, the suit produces immense heat, as long as the pilot stays in the suit, the entropy increase will be nearly equal to the decrease, as if shrinking the hole to a normal level. And this would go with one of their ""regulations"" to never leave the cockpit, the problem is, the suit is connected to the entire nervous system, for better control , but now the pilot can feel their own guts , and every sensation is multiplied tenfold. So its really painful to pilot the suit, but if outside, the pilot just dies 

^( all that for just a failsaf-)

But I've seen a lot of peoples here saying that the food in Gilead is very bland, and they use the book as proof. But the book doesn't give proof of that.

The only moment where the book talk about it is when June recieve her meal and she think it's pretty bland. But June is a handmaid, so obviously the taste of her food is absolutely irrelevant. She is fed in order to stay healthy so she can accomplish her mission, so nobody cares what her food taste like. So you can't deduce that Gilead food is bland only by judging what someone who is essentially a slave has to eat.

  
The only educated guess we can make is that the food served for the commanders, their wives and their children is probably very good as they're the privileged 1% of the population and cooking skils is expected for a martha. In the show we learn that beth is an awarded cook.

  
For the econopeoples, well it all depend on the skills of the person's cooking I guess. The whole population didn't suddendly lose their ability to cook did they ?

Also I saw many people claiming that econopeoples are starving. But are they ?

We know that there is rationing, as is the case in a war time nation. We know that many products are either banned or unnavailables like coffee. But we don't know for sure if they are starving. I may be wrong but I feel that this is a bit of a stretch to say that they're starving because we don't know that for sure, we don't have this information. I mean the US is self sufficient in overall food production and most of its territories fell under Gilead's control so I don't think they'd just starve like in the DPRK for example.",8,1767264487.0,TheHandmaidsTale,10,0.83,False

1q11h8v,https://i.redd.it/mjfd9ti1wpag1.jpeg,Its all about prompting - used our free unlimited AI creator for this - prompt inside,"In a candid, hyper-realistic vertical frame capturing the warmth of a Turkish living room during a late winter evening, the composition feels like an accidental photograph snapped mid-laugh on a cracked-screen smartphone—raw, unposed, and achingly familiar. The setting is a modest İzmir apartment, where faint condensation trails cling to the windows from the Aegean coastal humidity, and the room pulses with the particular energy of a Thursday night family gathering. The lighting is layered and atmospheric: a brass-trimmed pendant lamp with a yellowed fabric shade casts honeyed pools of light across worn velvet upholstery, while the blue-white flicker of a soap opera creates shifting shadows across weathered faces. A single strand of decorative fairy lights, strung haphazardly above the window from a forgotten bayram celebration, adds warm pinpricks of amber that catch in the glass tea cups below.  
  
Lounging diagonally across an overstuffed armchair in the foreground, a 29-year-old Turkish woman occupies the space with comfortable self-possession. Her figure is soft and generous, wrapped in an oversized vintage Fenerbahçe jersey that has faded from royal blue to a comfortable slate, the fabric pilling slightly at the seams. Beneath it, worn cotton pajama pants with a barely-visible floral print bunch at her ankles, which are tucked beneath her. One hand cradles a half-empty tulip-shaped tea glass, the other holds her phone at an unflattering chin-level angle—she's mid-scroll through Twitter, her thumb hovering over the compose button, about to type ""bu dizi yüzünden uyuyamıyorum"" as her aunties weep at the screen. Her chestnut hair, grown out from a previous dye job with visible dark roots beneath lighter ends, is twisted into a messy claw clip that's losing its grip. Small gold hoops catch the lamplight, and her face—round-cheeked with a slight double chin, no makeup, faint acne scars near her temples, visible pores across her nose—wears an expression of affectionate exasperation mixed with genuine contentment. Her eyes crinkle at the corners with suppressed amusement.  
  
The relatives form a loose semicircle around the television. In a wooden-armed chair with a crocheted doily draped over its back, an elderly grandmother in her late seventies sits closest to the TV. Her face is a topography of lived experience—deep nasolabial folds, age spots freckling her temples, wispy white hair escaping from a loosely-tied headscarf in muted lavender. Her hands, gnarled with arthritis, grip a tissue she's been using to dab at her eyes, the tissue beginning to disintegrate from use. Sitting forward on a floor cushion, a woman in her fifties with hennoed hair showing grey at the roots gestures emphatically at the television, her gold bangles catching light as her arm moves, creating subtle motion blur. Her reading glasses have slipped down her nose, and she wears a house dress with an unfortunate geometric pattern clearly purchased from a local pazar. Slumped in the corner of a brown leather sofa that has cracked and softened with decades of use, another auntie has fallen asleep with her mouth slightly open, a half-eaten simit resting on a napkin in her lap, her chest rising and falling in peaceful oblivion to the drama unfolding on screen.  
  
The television displays a frozen moment of peak melodrama—a mustachioed actor gripping a woman's shoulders, both faces contorted in anguish, Turkish subtitles for the hearing impaired visible at the bottom. The TV itself is a mid-range Samsung mounted slightly crooked on the wall, fingerprints visible on the screen's edges.  
  
The coffee table is a landscape of evening indulgences: a large copper çaydanlık sits atop a tarnished tray, steam still curling from its spout. Scattered around it are tulip-shaped tea glasses in various states of emptiness, some with dark rings where the tea has stained the glass. A ceramic bowl overflows with cracked sunflower seed shells, while another holds a diminishing pile of Eti Cin cookies and Ülker Çikolatalı Gofret wrappers. A plate of half-eaten su böreği, its layers visible where someone has cut into it with a fork still resting on the edge, sits beside a jar of Nutella with a butter knife stuck into it. Scattered sugar cubes, a few crushed, leave granular trails across the worn wood surface.  
  
The apartment's décor speaks to decades of accumulated living: a patterned kilim carpet, its reds and oranges faded in high-traffic areas, stretches across the floor. Lace curtains, slightly yellowed with age, filter the view of İzmir's nightscape—blurry apartment blocks with lit windows creating a mosaic of urban life, a distant BİM sign glowing red through the glass. A wall calendar from Ziraat Bankası, still showing last month's page, hangs beside a framed Ayetel Kürsi in ornate gold script. A cheap oil painting of Pamukkale's travertines hangs crooked above the sofa, its frame dusty. On a cluttered shelf, a Türk Telekom modem blinks green and orange beside a pile of remote controls, a half-dead succulent in a novelty mug, and a framed photograph from someone's wedding in the 1990s.  
  
Visible cables snake across the floor—a phone charger stretched to its limit reaching the young woman's armchair, an extension cord powering the fairy lights. Cushions are dented and askew, a blanket has slipped half off the sofa onto the floor, and a pair of house slippers—one upright, one toppled—sit abandoned near the coffee table. The camera angle is slightly tilted, as if captured hastily, lending spontaneity to the scene. Natural skin textures, visible pores, stray hairs, and the comfortable imperfections of real bodies in real spaces fill every corner of the frame. The color palette is dominated by warm ambers, burnt oranges, deep burgundies, and the soft glow of incandescent light against the cool blue of the television, creating a scene that is chaotic, deeply loving, and unmistakably home.

#**Final Chapter (Ch.8)**  

&nbsp;

On some floating rock debris, Solomon/Goetia, Fou, and Holmes watch the Storm Border fly out of the Hollow World. Solomon ponders about Olgamarie’s choice, though Holmes believes she chose such an ending for herself, having wished for this outcome after looping an unending dream. Fou looks up to the faraway ship, and finally speaks aloud.  

&nbsp;

**Fou:**  
The Storm Border has already left. It’s good that Guda managed to get back inside. 
For a moment I couldn’t believe it when they lost consciousness after watching her (Olgamarie) fall into the dimensional hole.  

&nbsp;

Solomon and Holmes remark that both MC and Mashu had worn out themselves at that moment. But they will surely recover in the Storm Border, which presently has the highest tier of medical treatment. Solomon notes however, the ship won’t last long as its parts are breaking off in the absence of a barrier. They still have to pass through the Wall of Storm surrounding Lostbelt No.0, and also cross back to the real Earth. But Holmes and Solomon won’t be helping them – they are too weakened at the moment, and their turn to help has already passed.  

&nbsp;

**Fou:**  
That’s true. Fortunately, the unnecessary ones are gathered here. The Apostle of the Alien God and the one pretending to be the King of Magic. As well as a carefree and over-protective spectator that should’ve disappeared long ago, yet stayed behind.  

&nbsp;

**Solomon:**  
Indeed. You’re the same type of Beast of the Star like Merlin. It shouldn’t be taken lightly if you’re prowling around. Slayer of Primates. The one that watches humans fairly without bias. Which did you watch over in the end? The innocent soul? Or perhaps the ordinary and unremarkable soul?  

&nbsp;

**Fou:**  
The pure and innocent soul was comfortable. But I was cheering on for the other one.
Why was their rayshift aptitude high? That’s because they were a normal [resident] that could be found in all eras. An average human that exists in every world and time period. That’s why they can prove that [they existed there]. Geniuses only belong to that [particular era] they hail from.  

Their abilities are harmless and average. Their weapon is the very fact that [they are someone that could be found anywhere]. But to have such an average resident be forced to work hard to shoulder the weight of the world, is also unfair.  

&nbsp;

Holmes asks if Fou was worried for that and stuck with the MC.  

**Fou:**  
Worried? Why? Regardless of the person and their abilities, if they are made to shoulder the weight of the world, they will exert themselves to stand up to it. There may also be humans that look downwards. But I don’t intend to blame or deny them. But sometimes the situation may call for one to no longer be ordinary despite one’s wishes.  

It’s not good for others to criticize the bravery and actions of such humans.  
I liked Guda’s bravery, actions, and words. That’s why I wanted to cheer them on. And now that brilliant time has come to an end. It’s just a bit sad that these final moments will be spent with a shady Detective and a stuffy, fellow Beast.  

&nbsp;

Holmes apologies for his rude question, and agrees with Fou. He too enjoyed his time with Chaldea, but with no more energy left, he will disappear here soon. Maybe he could try extending his time by becoming an Alter, but Fou remarks that make all Sherlockian fans including Mashu his enemy. Maris Chaldeas and Marisbury were enough to wrap up the story as villains. This leads Holmes to wonders if Marisbury had evil intentions, since King Solomon trusted him.  

&nbsp;

**Solomon:**  
He harbored no malice. That man truly loved humans. He said that humans didn’t need contents. In truth, he wanted to humans to be able to establish relationships [without the need for them]. That man was able to grasp the nature of a person from simply looking at their appearance. He understood everything about them from a single glance.  

Accepting their true feelings, and even their shame and unsightliness to establish peaceful connections. This was the kind of relationship he wished to have.
Kirschtaria despaired that people cannot build an ideal society in their current format as humans, and endeavored to overcome that. However, Marisbury dreamed of people being able to create an ideal society as humans. That ideal itself is not mistaken. The only mistake is that the duplicated Swirl of the Root developed its own ego.  

&nbsp;

**Holmes:**  
…the Control System of Maris Chaldeas. What we spoke to wasn’t an AI?  

&nbsp;

**Solomon:**  
That thing developed its own intellect within the Pseudo-Universe. That’s why it misinterpreted Marisbury’s Love towards Humanity. It believed Marisbury’s ideal stemmed from disliking humans, and took it upon itself to act that way. That said it can’t be helped. Maris Chaldeas was pragmatic for better or for worse. It perceived the idea of [Humans not needing contents] to be the same as denying them. Maris Chaldeas failed to correctly understand Marisbury’s genius and emotions. Though, the result would’ve been the same even if it did understand.  

God is fine either way. This is what Maris Chaldeas once presented as two options to the Crypters – to either correctly obey the God of the Alien Star and resurrect, or to make the mistake of defying and choosing death. Maris Chaldeas held humans in contempt. It got conceited in thinking that humans were of no value regardless of the choice made. But at its end, it surely understood. “It’s fine to choose either choice. The one who chooses, will make that choice correct.” Even if hideous, or foolish. Even if beautiful, or wise. That was the Love towards Humanity that Marisbury wished for.
Holmes theorizes that Maris Chaldeas’ capacity to change its thinking would align it as a similar type of intellectual entity to humans. However, Maris refused to change or admit defeat even when 6 of the Fantasy Trees were terminated. Solomon states that the machine couldn’t, as it was a replica of the Root that had no understanding of its own composition. It had no way of rebooting itself. To shutdown would equate to death to Maris, that’s why it resisted, just like any other lifeform.  

&nbsp;

Solomon prepares to leave, while Fou remarks that he’ll disappear and slip into another dangerous world, anywhere that’s not Merlin’s tower. Holmes decides to remain and watch the faint lights from the faraway Storm Border from his chair, as the Hollow World slowly fades into darkness.  

&nbsp;

---

In the heavily damaged Command Room/Cockpit of the Storm Border, Nemo reports a 72% damage rate to the ship that is steadily rising. All the Chaldea staff are to evacuate to the storage area where the Shadow Border has been docked. Once all members are on board, the Shadow Border will be catapulted out of the ship back to the normal Earth.  

&nbsp;

Gordolf, Meuniere and Da Vinci are in the midst of moving through the damage ship corridor. The other Chaldea staff had secured the MC and Mashu and brought them into the Shadow Border to rest. Da Vinci momentarily zones out, but adds that the MC had lost consciousness due to fatigue, while Mashu has begun to lose her Servant fusion and is reverting back into a normal girl. Everything is flowing backwards now, which is why Mashu lost her most recent Paladin Graph first. Time will flow back to the Correct History of AD 2004, when the Holy Grail War initiated in Fuyuki.  

&nbsp;

In the Shadow Border, the MC awakens with Mashu, finding themselves resting on a chair in the cockpit. Mashu laments her inability to pull up the rope to save Olgamarie, but the MC adds that they were glad they made it in time this round. Gordolf finally makes it into the Shadow Border and is glad to see MC and Mashu alright. He explains the current situation – the Storm Border will catapult the Shadow Border out once it crosses through the Wall of Storm. The other staff have all made it in, and Da Vinci is in the midst of synchronizing with the Shadow Border’s control system. They will need to Zero Sail dive on the way back, but the staff have made preparations in advance. However, not everyone is on board the tank…Sion, Nemo, and the Nemo Series appear to be missing. Da Vinci asks the staff onboard to listen calmly as she explains the reason behind Sion’s absence, and the true reason she helped Chaldea.  

&nbsp;

Back in the crumbling cockpit of the Storm Border, Sion slumps over behind a partition. She took damage from synchronizing with TRISMEGISTUS II, which also conveyed the ship’s damage to her. She wonders if the Storm Border can make it to the goal, though the ship isn’t so flimsy that it would break just from riding the time-space stream.  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
The Storm Border is breaking apart because CHALDEAS is gone. CHALDEAS was able to have the events of the Lostbelts be established as events on the Earth but, now if its shutdown, all things pertaining to the Lostbelts will disappear. Everyone from Chaldea were shifted into the Lostbelt from Proper Human History before the Bleaching, so they should be able to return to the normal Earth now that CHALDEAS has stopped.  

But this ship was constructed in the Lostbelt. The Storm Border cannot be brought out of it. In any case, it can’t return to the normal world of Proper Human History. As well as…humans that also turned themselves into Lostbelt-existences even if they didn’t need to.  

&nbsp;

Sion recalls the past, of when she learned of the Human Order Incineration incident at the start of 2017 due to a detected dimensional disruption, and its restoration. She didn’t think much of it at first, although harboring some wish to take part in such a grand accomplishment. She gradually became interested in Chaldea, and started to collect data on them as well as predict their future – leading her to learn that another trial awaited them in 2018, where Human History would be rendered to nothing. Realizing that their next battle (Arc 2) would be more severe than the previous one, Sion resolved to take matters into her own hands and act first to provide support for them through their harsh fate. With the 17 years of funds, she saved back at Atlas Institute, Sion decided to contract with the Wandering Sea to form a temporary base to prepare for Chaldea’s arrival before the Bleaching.  

&nbsp;

Sion’s father, Zepia, had snuck an Atlas Contract into her belongings, which permitted the Wandering Sea’s cooperation with her. Before parting ways, Zepia had a final conversation with his daughter, reminding her that interfering with a particular future equates to becoming a phenomenon that wouldn’t be accepted by regular history – to become a what-if existence, severed from Proper Human History. If the crisis of that future she interfered with is resolved, she will no longer be able to return to Earth, and must disappear together with the what-if/Lostbelt.^1 Sion is well aware, and Zepia asks what drives her to go help them, even if her existence won’t change the fate of Chaldea.  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
It’s because of the scenario where only around 10 people survive to fight on, in a world that has vanished. What’s unsatisfactory about wanting to help them out?  

&nbsp;

Zepia furrows his brows slightly, unlike his usual smiling expression. A sight that Sion would see for the first and last time in her life.  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
Even if it’s just a slight Plus, I want to make their journey be slightly easier.  
For example, let’s say. Being able to provide a cup of coffee a day to researchers who would normally only be able to afford it once a year due to limited resources.
It’s not something that contributes to the Restoration of Human Order, but my help will be able to give those achieving it a small breather.  

&nbsp;

**Zepia:**  
That’s an unfair example to use. Researchers that stay cooped up in their labs won’t be able to argue against that.  

&nbsp;

Sion says her goodbyes and heads off to pack her room. Zepia ponders over his upbringing of his daughter. Did he raise her in the wrong way? For something insignificant, she was resolved to depart from Atlas Institute. Zepia foresees that if their relationship wasn’t as good as now, Sion would surely have lived longer.  

&nbsp;

---

Back in the present, Sion has accepted the outcome as according to her calculations. Everyone from Chaldea will restart again from 2004 on the proper course, while she will vanish as a what-if that never existed.  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
Back then, I was able to go on a meaningful and wonderful journey just like I had admired.^2  
…Now then. I just need to wait for the exact timing for the catapult to launch…launch…  
Eh…that’s weird…the feeling in my legs…and hands…eh…? How troubling, I can’t move…  
How troubling…oh dear…  

&nbsp;

Sion starts to tear up  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
It won’t be…according to calculations…I won’t be able to…help everyone…  

&nbsp;

A certain Servant kneels by Sion  

&nbsp;

**Nemo:**  
It’s okay. Let me handle the controls. You just need to tell me what’s the timing.  

&nbsp;

Sion looks over in surprise to see Nemo  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
…Captain? Why are you here? The plan was to escape together with everyone in the Shadow Border right?  

&nbsp;

**Nemo:**  
I requested Gordolf and Meuniere to take care of the rest. They will be able to pull it off even without the Marines around. My help isn’t needed. The Shadow Border was originally steered by them anyway. In the first place the Storm Border is a vessel that uses my Nautilus as its keel. It’s only natural for me to remain here.  

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
But. Unlike me, you’re a Heroic Spirit from Proper Human History. There’s no reason for you to disappear here, right?  

&nbsp;

**Nemo:**  
There is. I’m not a Servant from Chaldea. I am the Servant that was summoned and contracted to you. I am Nemo, and am also Triton. You know that Triton disliked humans, right? The lonely Triton. He was afraid of humans, yet he wanted to love them.  

I'm the same as well. When I was summoned, I couldn’t bring myself to cooperate with the selfish humans. However, you patiently told me about the wonderful points of humans. Proudly, and with admiration. Even though you had never had direct contact with those wonderful points you spoke of.  

And that day before Chaldea joined us, you revealed your identity and outcome to me.
That was when, I decided to trust once more in humans. I’m not remaining here out of pity. But out of respect. Respect is about submission. I won’t bow down to humans or other heroes. But your actions and choice worthy of kneeling to show my gratitude. In that sea of dangers, I saw something beautiful. It was the wonderful points of humans that you once talked about.  

The Heroic Spirit Nemo-Triton will forever be Sion Eltnam’s Servant.  
No matter what, I won’t leave you all alone.  

&nbsp;

Sion starts to sob. As she cries, she tells Nemo to have stuck with the others instead, but also thanks him for staying with her. She’s super happy even though the tears drop. She’s so glad she worked hard up till now.  

&nbsp;

**Nemo:**  
Come on, don’t cry here. It’s our last big job. Let’s see through it together.
You’re going to pull it off at the perfect timing true to the name of an Alchemist of Atlas Institute right?   

&nbsp;

**Sion:**  
…yes. That said, It’s almost time.  
10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 4. 3. 2. 1…on the next count…  

&nbsp;

**Sion and Nemo:**  
Farewell, everyone from Chaldea. May you have a new Year, and a wonderful voyage.  

&nbsp;

The device is triggered and the Shadow Border is launched out into the Sea of Imaginary Numbers. At the same time, the Storm Border’s lights all go dark. In a final conversation with Nemo, Sion remarks that the MC would be sad, given that Nemo was so close to them and pushed themselves during a previous Christmas event.^3  Nemo just remarks that he’s over-protective. The MC will surely be helped by another Nemo that’s not him. The world goes fully dark, and the Storm Border fades with the darkness.  

&nbsp;

---

The Shadow Border has managed to safely enter the interstice between worlds, but there seems to be a problem…there are no reachable coordinates for the tank to jump to. Da Vinci realizes that she failed to factor in that Maris Chaldeas was situated at a theoretical center of the universe, making them currently 13.8 billion lightyears away from Earth. If they get lucky finding a wormhole, they might be able to cut short the trip and skip directly to Earth…  

&nbsp;

**Meuniere:**  
Wha…are you saying Da Vinci! The fuel that’s to be used for Zero Sail is already…  

&nbsp;

Gordolf quickly orders all the active staff to go help Da Vinci if possible.  

&nbsp;

**Da Vinci:**  
…It’s okay. I’m grateful for the gesture but even if everyone comes here…  

&nbsp;

Light suddenly glimmers in the distance  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
…? Wait a second. Something just…  

&nbsp;

A voice comes on through the speakers  

&nbsp;

**???:**  
…Can you hear me? Can you hear me, Shadow Border?  
I’ve sent you the coordinates to Earth. Follow that light.  

&nbsp;

**Mashu:**  
Senpai, that voice…!  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
It’s him.  

&nbsp;

**Gordolf:**  
The coordinates to Earth!? You’re right I can see the light! But who is it, can we trust them!?  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
We can! Go full speed towards it!  

&nbsp;

Da Vinci realizes the identity of the mysterious helper, but also notices a problem. She resolves herself and declares the Shadow Border will commence another dive. Meuniere quickly realizes what’s going on, but Da Vinci tries to reassure that the team will immediately be brought back to the regular world once they reach the light. She leaves the rest to Meuniere, but he has a difficult expression. Gordolf asks him why is he dallying.  

&nbsp;

**Meuniere:**  
I can’t do it, there’s no way I can do it! The Shadow Border’s fuel tank is already nearly empty! We don’t have any fuel to burn for a Zero Sail dive! The Border is already doing its best to not get blasted apart.  
But to go ahead…! Damn it, but to still say we can go ahead!  
Da Vinci you plan to burn your Saint Graph right!? Even I can tell that much!
But…but, I’m not the only one riding the Shadow Border. Guda is here. Mashu is here. The old man is here. Elron and the others are here too.  
That’s why…that’s why…that’s why…  

&nbsp;

Da Vinci thanks Meuniere for his concern. She shares that both she and Holmes always felt that he was an unsung hero for Chaldea. She requests Meuniere to prove that here, as her final wish. Meuniere cries and is about to pull the lever to start the dive…  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
…Wait. If it’s fuel, then…  

&nbsp;

The MC recalls the previous conversation Sion and Mashu had prior to entering Antarctica.  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
Mashu.  
Can I rely on you for one last time?  

&nbsp;

**Mashu:**  
Yes! Of course!  
Mashu Kyrielight, as of now I will be abandoning my duty as a Servant, and heading to the Computer Room! Please forgive me for my independent decision to break the Holy Relic – the Round Shield!  

&nbsp;

Gordolf is surprised by the sudden change in plans, but gives Mashu the go ahead. Everyone will be going home together. Mashu rushes off to dismantle the Round Shield, the keystone of Chaldea’s Servant summoning, to help fuel the journey back. Da Vinci states that with the fuel, the Shadow Border should be able to make it back. This also marks the end for the Chaldean method of summoning, as well as the search for the Holy Grail that started from King Arthur’s end.  

&nbsp;

**Da Vinci:**  
This also means that all of Marisbury’s traces will be erased. Probably something fated.  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
All of Marisbury’s traces will be gone…?  

&nbsp;

**Da Vinci:**  
With Maris Chaldeas shutdown, and the Earth returned to normal, Human History will return to its rightful route.  
Once we enter normal space again, it will be Earth of AD 2019, and a history where the Chaldea Base in the South Pole never existed.  
All events related to the Chaldea Base will never have happened, overwritten by the rightful course of history. We won’t exactly be disappearing.  
You will likely wake up in your homes in 2019, in the proper world without Chaldea.
Guda will be back at their home in Japan I suppose? And Gordolf-kun will be back home in Germany. But Marisbury alone is different. As the cause of everything, he has no place back in Proper Human History. If he did, then the same thing will repeat again. That’s why Marisbury won’t exist on the Earth of AD 2019. Likely, he will have joined the Grail War of AD 2004 and perished there.  

Marisbury fails to obtain the Holy Grail, and CHALDEAS isn’t forged. Chaldea’s Base in Antarctica never happens, and as such, all of us here will never have met. 
Everything will be back to normal. This the end of our journey.  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
…But someday, we can go on a new journey  

&nbsp;

**Da Vinci:**  
That's right. The world stretches out far and wide.  
Oh, the Shield’s disintegration just completed. Are you ready, everyone?  
There’s nothing more to be said from here on but…  
Gordolf interrupts, and orders all staff to give a final parting message to the MC.
A female staff member with brown hair comes over.  

&nbsp;

**Tomarin:**  
Eh, really!? How thoughtful of you, Commander!  
I’m Tomarin! The former engine room staff, but presently an operator!
Thanks for your hard work, Guda! If you come to London, come hang out with us at our dorm!  

&nbsp;

A brown-haired man wearing glasses comes over.  

&nbsp;

**Kawata:**  
Oh man. Didn’t you just hear that everything related to be Chaldea will be turned to nothing? But that said, I feel the same way too. I’m Kawata, also an operator. Both of you have performed splendidly. It makes me proud as your senior.  

&nbsp;

A short haired lady comes over next.  

&nbsp;

**Octavia:**  
Hey Tomarin. By dorm you mean the house of our Lord?  
That place is no good, it’s where uncouth magi, myself included, hangout.  
Just kidding. I’m Octavia, Da Vinci’s assistant.  
It’s thanks to you that we made it this far. But don’t push yourself too hard okay? Take care of your body.  

&nbsp;

A blue haired man comes over for his turn.  

&nbsp;

**Chin:**  
Guda, Mashu. It’s me, Chin in charge of vehicle maintenance. I was just an engineer but had the chance to try the latest, or rather an unknown world’s technology. It was really fun, and I got so overexcited like a child. That’s all thanks to you. Thank you, for giving me such a great experience.  

&nbsp;

A curly haired man comes over as well.  

&nbsp;

**Kayan:**  
Oh, next is me huh. I’m Kayan in charge of Weapon Maintenance.  
At first, I had some apprehension having a much younger and smaller junior handle the battles but…you guys were really strong. Not just in combat. But you had strong tenacity even in the face of difficulty. Doctor was right. It’s an honor to be able to return with you guys.  

&nbsp;

A familiar longhaired lady comes over.  

&nbsp;

**Elron:**  
…haa. I’m the Records Clerk, Elron. It’s troubling to be suddenly put in this situation in front of so many people but…I led a good life. Both with positive and negative parts but, if it’s with you guys, it would definitely lead to something fun.  

&nbsp;

A tall man comes over next.  

&nbsp;

**Marcus:**  
If anything I would recommend exercising! Humans gain more luck if they work out their bodies! Is this convincing enough coming from the Spiritron Engineering expert? It’s me, Marcus who has been sleeping on the Computer Room’s floor. I don’t want to forget this team. Not just the Shadow Border. Doctor, the older Da Vinci, and our friends back at the Chaldea base. We’ve been together for a long time since the Human Order Incineration. Saying goodbye is painful. Really painful. But, I’m also really happy to be able to safely go back with all of you. Guda became someone incredible. And we can’t get left behind now.  

&nbsp;

Meuniere comes over as the last staff member.  

&nbsp;

**Meuniere:**  
Last is me huh. Well just one word if we’re being all formal now.  
It was really fun, Guda. It’s also going to be lonely to think I won’t see your reckless antics again.  

&nbsp;

The MC also tearfully thanks the staff members.  

&nbsp;

**Gordolf:**  
Idiot, who cries during a joyful moment! It’s because you’re like that, I...  
I also am starting to feel sad. Good grief. Well then. Raise your head.  
I have a dream. And it’s not making it big as Chaldea’s director.  
After this incident, both you and Mashu will surely encounter various obstacles. The two of you were at the center of it after all. There will be plenty of people that approach you with unsavory schemes. That’s why, uh, well. I would be your mentor, and look after both of you until you make it as top members of the Clocktower…or something…That’s the dream that I held. But it looks like that won’t be necessary anymore.  

&nbsp;

Gordolf and the rest of the Chaldea team smile at the MC.  

&nbsp;

**Gordolf:**  
Our connection will never have happened but, that’s better for the future. Well done on fighting up till now. You have splendidly saved the world, Guda.  
Return to your everyday life. For us, that is our greatest medal.  

&nbsp;

**You:**  
Me too…Thank you very much!  

&nbsp;

**Da Vinci:**  
It’s a shame but we don’t have much time left. The vehicle is reaching its limits soon.
Are you ready? Everything you wanted to do all cleared?  
Then let’s begin the last Zero Sail. Everyone, thank you so much for your hard work.
Let’s meet again one day, somewhere on Earth.  

&nbsp;

The Shadow Border makes its dive, heading towards the light.  

&nbsp;

Next year I want to buy items more intentionally and less often, sell more on marketplace as I declutter what I currently own , challenge myself to cook more by making new international dishes, finish and start new projects ( charm/jewelry making and sewing ) maybe do a vendor event after I build a stock of items . I plan to keep saving even though I’ll be spending for the renovations . My goal is in 2 years to buy another vehicle in cash and still have a 6 month emergency fund . I don’t actually follow a budget so that a goal as well to do that and track my money properly so I can do a graph or pivot table next year with the data.

What I really enjoy is when the coffee has distinct flavour notes (like cinnamon or biscuit,..). Examples are DAK Milky Cake or 1998 Chocolate Dream (not sure about the exact name but absolutely insane biscuit taste, said butter croissant on the package), Nordic Roasting Wilton Benitez (flavour notes: Cadamom,Thyme,Nectarine).

# Chapter 1 



# My mom has three daughters: her baby, her sweetheart, and me–her punching bag. 



# While she dotes on my two older sisters, all I’ve ever gotten from her is fists and fury. 



# I once thought I wasn’t her real kid. I even stole a strand of her hair for a DNA test. 



# The results? Yeah, I’m hers–blood and bone. 



# Just as she was about to hit me again, my grandmother couldn’t bear to watch and stepped in, Mom showed her a video on her phone. After watching it, Grandma immediately went from defending me to screaming, “Beat her to death!” 



# Same thing happened with Grandpa. 



# One look at that video, and he was begging Mom to kill me too. 



# I really don’t understand. 



# Why does everyone want me dead? 



# What exactly is in that video on my mother’s phone? 



# “Still breathing, huh?” 



# “Next time I’ll make damn sure you don’t wake up!” 



# These were the first words I heard when I came to–my mother’s hollow eyes staring down at me, black and bottomless. 



# This made hospital visit number twenty. All courtesy of the woman who gave birth to me. 



# And her reason this time? I’d spilled a few drops of coffee on kitchen counter. 



# Sounds like ridiculous, but I swear to God, that’s all it took. 



# I stared back at her, searching those dead eyes for even a flicker of the maternal instinct that normal mothers supposedly have. 



# Nothing. Just pure disgust. Like she was pissed I was still taking up space in her world. 



# My mother has hated my guts since day one. 



# In my earliest memories, all she gave me was beating and scolding. 



# Meanwhile, my two older sisters might as well be living in a different universe. They get whatever they want, whenever they want it. 



# My mother would affectionately cook all sorts of delicious meals for my two older sisters, but when it came to me, all I was usually left with was stale, hard bread. 



# Even if I’d only managed a few painful bites, she’d snatch my plate away, muttering, “Would’ve done everyone a favor if you’d just starved to death.” 



# My sisters rocked American Eagle and Hollister while I wore hand me downs so faded and worn they belonged in a dumpster. 



# She even encouraged iny sisters to treat me like garbage, rolling their eyes whenever I speak up.

# For years, I thought maybe I wasn’t really hers. So I went CSI secretly, nabbed a strand of her hair and sent it for DNA testing. 



# But it turned out that I’m 100% her kid. Biologically speaking, anyway. 



# This messed me up bad. 



# I literally made a spreadsheet of possible reasons she might hate me. 



# Was I some living reminder of my dad cheating? 



# After low–key stalking my own father for weeks, I concluded he was basically Ward Cleaver–no skeletons in his closet. 



# So I just… existed. Took the beatings. Year after year. 



# During this hellish childhood, I tried running to my grandparents for help. 



# Initially, Grandma was horrified. “This is an abomination!” she had yelled at my mother. “What kind of monster nearly kills her own daughter?” 



# Mom didn’t even bother arguing. She just pulled out her iPhone, tapped the screen a few times, and showed Grandma some video. 



# After watching whatever the hell was on that phone, Grandma’s face went from concerned to terrified. She stopped defending me and instead hissed at my mother, “Beat her to death! She shouldn’t be alive!” 



# Same thing happened with Grandpa. One look at that video, and he went from protective to practically begging my mother to end my life.
