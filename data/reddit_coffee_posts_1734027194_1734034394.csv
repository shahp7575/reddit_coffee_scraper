I live in a block of flats that is on top of a bar. The flats have been occupied before the bar existed. The social landlord also owns the retail units downstairs in which the bar operates in.

For the the past 4 weeks they have been blasting music to a point that I a hearing impaired person can hear it and just make out what's being played. Not only that, the music has been vibrating my bath, bathroom sink, toilet, bed, sofa, coffee table and the floor in parts of my property. So much so it is keeping me up at night past 11pm.

I had made a complaint with the local council who are acting slow, but I have sent audio recordings as they requested. I have spoken to the bar downstairs to which the staff told me it's not that loud. I told them it was too loud as a hearing impaired person was able to hear it. I've also written complaints to them as they continue to play excessively loud music.

Nothing has changed and I am still waiting for action from the local council. I have also found out that the bar owner has been parking their car in our resident's only car park and without a permit. This could constitute them to receive a fine or even have their car towed. Since the social landlord has told them they are not authorised to park there they still continue to do so. Along with breaking numerous rules in their lease agreement.

I have decided that I will be reporting their vehicle for parking in the residents only carpark without a permit. I couldn't care less if they got a ticket or were towed.

1hcu0mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1hcu0mc/software_recommendations_asset_management_and/,Software Recommendations - Asset Management and Ticketing Software,"Hello Fellow Sysadmins,

I am reaching out to this lovely subreddit for some software recommendations.

Some background. I work for a charity as the IT Manager. The charity has grown organically since its inception over 30 years ago, but I am the first-ever IT employee. I report directly to C-level. We have about 50 employees, and I share the IT responsibilities with our MSP. I have bridged many gaps since joining the charity, mainly in cyber security, because it was a disaster, and now trying to push an IT Policy (we have no IT Policy, so users are welcome to save passwords tapped to monitors, etc). 

I am currently trying to evaluate two other software needs and I am looking for recommendations. These solutions can be paid or free.   
**Asset Management** \- Our MSP manages our computers, so I am not worried about them going missing or who they are assigned to; I am concerned about everything else. We have docking stations, monitors, mobile devices, etc, that are not inventoried at all. Since COVID, employees brought home all this equipment as well so I have very little idea what is out in the world that is owned by us. I am looking for software that I (and maybe my reporting manager/another IT employee, if I ever get one) can add to all our assets. I want to include everything from Computers to adapters. Any recommendations? Excel is just not cutting it. Depending on the software, I would also expand it to the rest of the Operations team so they can inventory the assets they have (paper towels, coffee, office supplies, etc).

**Ticketing Software** \- We have ticketing software with our MSP, but I would like an in-house one as well. I get a lot of requests that do not go to our MSP as well. I always make sure to get requests in writing, so I am not worried about ""proving"" a change was requested; it is more about organizing them in one piece of software that can easily be searched, assigned, etc. I have used ConnectWise in the past, among a lot of others, but that might be overkill for my needs. I would also like to add other uses possible into the software for their requests (Operations and Communication Teams). You are welcome to make fun of me for this, I am currently using MS Planner to organize my requests and due dates.

Thanks in advance!",1,1734034047.0,sysadmin,1,1.0,False

# DEC. 12th 2024~China banned exports of a few rare minerals to the US. Things could get messier.

Gallium and germanium are used to make semiconductors. Could battery materials be the next target?

[China banned exports of a few rare minerals to the US. Things could get messier. | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/12/1108568/china-export-bans/)

[Chinatopix via AP Images](https://preview.redd.it/4i0alch73h6e1.png?width=1454&format=png&auto=webp&s=abf21407915cd164d635797ebbe82163a7adabb7)

*This article is from The Spark,* MIT Technology Review*’s weekly climate newsletter. To receive it in your inbox every Wednesday,* [*sign up here*](https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/climate-energy-the-spark/)*.*

I’ve thought more about gallium and germanium over the last week than I ever have before (and probably more than anyone ever should).

As you may already know, [China banned the export of those materials to the US last week](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/06/1108020/what-chinas-critical-mineral-ban-means-for-the-us/) and placed restrictions on others. The move is just the latest drama in escalating trade tensions between the two countries.

While the new export bans could have significant economic consequences, this might be only the beginning. China is a powerhouse, and not just in those niche materials—it’s also a juggernaut in clean energy, and particularly in battery supply chains. So what comes next could have significant consequences for EVs and climate action more broadly.

A super-quick catch-up on the news here: The Biden administration recently restricted exports of chips and other technology that could help China develop advanced semiconductors. Also, president-elect Donald Trump [has floated all sorts of tariffs](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/11/25/1107224/how-trumps-tariffs-could-drive-up-the-cost-of-batteries-evs-and-more/) on Chinese goods.

Apparently in response to some or all of this, China banned the export of gallium, germanium, antimony, and superhard materials used in manufacturing, and said it may further restrict graphite sales. The materials are all used for both military and civilian technologies, and significantly, gallium and germanium are used in semiconductors.

It’s a ramp-up from last July, [when China placed restrictions on gallium and germanium exports](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/07/10/1076025/china-export-control-semiconductor-material/) after enduring years of restrictions by the US and its Western allies on cutting-edge technology. (For more on the details of China’s most recent move, including potential economic impacts, check out the [full coverage from my colleague James Temple](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/12/06/1108020/what-chinas-critical-mineral-ban-means-for-the-us/).)

**What struck me about this news is that this could be only the beginning, because China is central to many of the supply chains snaking around the globe.**

This is no accident—take gallium as an example. The metal is a by-product of aluminum production from bauxite ore. China, as the world’s largest aluminum producer, certainly has a leg up to be a major player in the niche material. But other countries could produce gallium, and I’m sure more will. China has a head start because it [invested in gallium separation and refining technologies](https://cen.acs.org/policy/trade/Firms-brace-China-ban-exports/102/web/2024/12).

A similar situation exists in the battery world. China is a dominant player all over the supply chain for lithium-ion batteries—not because it happens to have the right metals on its shores (it doesn’t), but because it’s invested in extraction and processing technologies.

Take lithium, a crucial component in those batteries. China has around [8% of the world’s lithium reserves](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-could-a-us-china-trade-war-mean-for-the-energy-transition/) but processes about 58% percent of the world’s lithium supply. The situation is similar for other key battery metals. Nickel that’s mined in Indonesia goes to China for processing, and the same goes for cobalt from the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Over the past two decades, [China has thrown money, resources, and policy behind electric vehicles](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/21/1068880/how-did-china-dominate-electric-cars-policy/). Now China leads the world in EV registrations, many of the largest EV makers are Chinese companies, and the country is home to a huge chunk of the supply chain for the vehicles and their batteries.

**As the world begins a shift toward technologies like EVs, it’s becoming clear just how dominant China’s position is in many of the materials crucial to building that tech.**

Lithium prices have dropped by 80% over the past year, and while part of the reason is a slowdown in EV demand, another part is that China is oversupplying lithium, [according to US officials](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/china-is-oversupplying-lithium-eliminate-rivals-us-official-says-2024-10-08/). By flooding the market and causing prices to drop, China could make it tougher for other lithium processors to justify sticking around in the business.

The new graphite controls from China could wind up affecting battery markets, too. Graphite is crucial for lithium-ion batteries, which use the material in their anodes. It’s still not clear whether the new bans will affect battery materials or just higher-purity material that’s used in military applications, [according to reporting from Carbon Brief](https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-what-could-a-us-china-trade-war-mean-for-the-energy-transition/).

To this point, China hasn’t specifically banned exports of key battery materials, and it’s not clear exactly how far the country would go. Global trade politics are delicate and complicated, and any move that China makes in battery supply chains could wind up coming back to hurt the country’s economy. 

But we could be entering into a new era of material politics. Further restrictions on graphite, or moves that affect lithium, nickel, or copper, could have major ripple effects around the world for climate technology, because batteries are key not only for electric vehicles, but increasingly for our power grids. 

While it’s clear that tensions are escalating, it’s still unclear what’s going to happen next. The vibes, at best, are uncertain, and this sort of uncertainty is exactly why so many folks in technology are so focused on how to diversify global supply chains. Otherwise, we may find out just how tangled those supply chains really are, and what happens when you yank on threads that run through the center of them.

Today, the EU, the United States and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) participated in a workshop on public-private Investment in critical minerals.     

Today, the EU, the US and other stakeholders in the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) took part in a workshop titled 'Public-Private Investment in Critical Minerals Focusing on Developing a Positive, Trade-Friendly Local Value Addition Agenda in Producing Countries'.   

This was the first in a series of workshops that will be organised under the MSP Forum. The workshop took place in Brussels during the 2024 edition of [Raw Materials Week](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/sectors/raw-materials/week_en). Participants discussed three key issues: the challenges facing investors, government policies aimed at fostering the development of the critical raw materials sector, and ways to mobilise investment to increase local value addition. 

Fostering investment in critical raw materials and creating sustainable local value addition for resource-rich countries is a key facet of the MSP Forum. Participants from financial institutions highlighted the importance of de-risking the investment climate to facilitate more investment, while government representatives outlined how successful policy initiatives can support greater development of the critical raw materials sector. Finally, representatives from civil society provided valuable insights into the inclusion of local communities, and the importance of upholding the highest possible sustainability standards and mitigating environmental and social risks in critical material projects. 

# Next steps

The MSP Forum will convene another workshop on environmental, social and governance standards during the Mining Indaba conference in Cape Town in February 2025. 

# Background

The MSP Forum builds on the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Package adopted in March 2023, which emphasised the need for more diverse and more sustainable critical raw materials (CRM) supply chains through new international mutually supportive partnerships, such as the CRM Club. The MSP consists of 15 partners, who are automatic members of the MSP Forum (Australia, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom, the United States and the EU), alongside 15 new MSP Forum members (Argentina, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Greenland, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Namibia, Peru, the Philippines, Serbia, Türkiye, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, and Zambia).

CRMs are indispensable for a wide range of technologies needed for EU strategic sectors such as the net-zero industry, digital, energy, transportation, space and defence. While demand for these critical raw materials has never been higher, the supply of CRMs faces increasing geopolitical, environmental, and social risks, highlighting the need for greater cooperation between like-minded international partners to secure and diversify CRM supply chains.

On December 12 in Brussels, the European Commission hosted during its Raw Materials Week, a meeting of the Minerals Security Partnership (MSP) Principals that focused on specific projects as part of the Forum’s Project Group and a workshop on local value addition as part of the Forum’s Policy Dialogue Group.  These meetings were co-chaired and hosted by Kim Jin-dong, Director General for Bilateral Economic Affairs of ROK Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Jose W. Fernandez, U.S. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment, and Kerstin Jorna, Director General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship, and SMEs at the European Commission.

The Principals meeting, led by the Republic of Korea and the United States, convened government officials and private sector investors and focused on advancing and accelerating MSP projects on rare earth elements, as well as identifying new responsible mining, processing, and recycling projects for critical minerals in MSP Forum member jurisdictions.

At the ROK-led MSP Project Deep Dive meeting, participants discussed the challenges to developing specific MSP projects, including HyProMag’s rare earth elements recycling project in the UK, Germany and the US, and the newly added Arafura Rare Earths’ Nolans Project in Australia, and identified means to advance these projects.  Additionally, the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) provided a briefing on its REEs recycling technology and ongoing projects.

At the MSP Forum’s Project Group meeting, participants took note of the recent presentations from the governments and private sector of MSP Forum members Argentina and Greenland and appreciated the exchange on specific critical mineral projects and investment opportunities in their countries.  MSP Forum members will continue to make individual country presentations on specific projects to MSP Partners and the MSP Finance Network over the next several weeks and months in partnership with the Minerals Investment Network for Vital Energy Security and Transition (MINVEST).    

The workshop on local value addition, led by the European Commission, will be the first of a series of events that will take place as part of the Policy Dialogue component of the MSP Forum.  The workshop consisted of three sessions on various topics, including investment challenges for investors in critical mineral value chains, government policies focused on local value addition, and examples of how to mobilize investments for local value addition.

The MSP looks forward to hosting MSP Forum members for the next MSP Forum event on the margins of Mining Indaba in Cape Town, South Africa on 4 February 2025.

**WASHINGTON, D.C.--** Chairman John Moolenaar (R-MI) and Ranking Member Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL) of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party joined Rep. Rob Wittman (R-VA) and Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), co-chairs of the Committee’s Critical Mineral Policy Working Group, to introduce new bipartisan legislation that helps address the United States’ dependence on the CCP for critical minerals and jumpstart American industry and workforce alongside our allies and partners.

Spearheaded by Rep. Wittman and Rep. Castor, the working group spent months evaluating the United States’ deep reliance on the CCP for critical minerals and developing solutions. Now, members are introducing three new bipartisan bills and a bipartisan working group policy report, [**Creating Resilient Critical Mineral Supply Chains**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Critical%20Minerals%20Report%20Cover%20%281%29-merged.pdf). Members of the Critical Mineral Policy Working Group are: Rep. Wittman, Rep. Castor, Rep. Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO), Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI), Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-NY), and Rep. Ben Cline (R-VA).

The bills developed by the working group are the *Earth Sciences and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024,* an amendment to the *Export Reform Act of 2018,* and the *Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act.* Summaries of the bills and the report can be found below.

*“The success of the American industrial economy is dependent on our foremost adversary for essential critical minerals. This is untenable and dangerous for the American people, and the legislation the working group is introducing today will safeguard America’s supply chains and reduce our economy’s dependence on the Chinese Communist Party,”* **said Chairman Moolenaar.** *“Thank you to Rep. Wittman and Rep. Castor for their bipartisan leadership and the solutions they have crafted on behalf of the Select Committee.”*

*“I want to thank Reps. Castor and Wittman for their bipartisan leadership and collaboration in introducing three bipartisan pieces of legislation and a bipartisan policy report that will help our country diversify its critical minerals supply moving forward and reduce our reliance on the PRC and other foreign sources for critical materials. I’m pleased that these bills provide a significant boost to American industry and workforce to meet the growing demand for critical minerals that are essential to our national security and clean energy technologies,""* **said Ranking Member Krishnamoorthi**

*“The Chinese Communist Party’s dominance of global critical minerals supply chains poses a dire economic threat to U.S. national security,”* **said Rep. Wittman.** *“As lead of the Select Committee’s Critical Minerals Policy Working Group, I’ve spent the past few months convening roundtables with experts to inform Congress on securing our critical mineral supply chains. We have worked to generate proposals to reduce China’s dominance, which has run unchecked for far too long. Their product dumping, escalatory export controls, destructive environmental practices, and forced labor abuses must not be tolerated. I’m proud of these comprehensive pieces of legislation that will remove unnecessary export controls on key critical minerals and improve scientific and technical cooperation in the earth sciences with allied foreign countries. These bills will help us fundamentally reset the United States’ economic and technological competition with China.”*

*“America’s dependence on adversarial nations for critical minerals poses a significant threat to our national security and our clean energy future,”* ***said Rep. Castor.*** *“This legislative package promotes sustainable development and strengthens our domestic supply chains through international partnerships, export controls and workforce development. I’m grateful to Rep. Wittman and our working group colleagues for the meaningful, bipartisan work that created this package. By working together, we can enhance our energy security and create new opportunities for American workers and businesses.”*

 *“The US is reliant on foreign sources for 50% or more of the 41 of 50 minerals identified as critical – this is unacceptable,” said Rep. Haley Stevens. “The Critical Mineral Working Group led by Representatives Rob Wittman (R-VA) and Cathy Kastor (R-FL) is getting results and spurred the introduction of my Black Mass and Sworf Export Control Act today. The foundational work done by the committee and detailed in the bipartisan report released this morning, provides much needed guidance as we head into the next Congress and continue working to secure American manufacturing capabilities, create sustainable critical mineral supply chains, and ensure we maintain the upper hand in strategic competition with China,”*  **said Rep. Stevens.**

*""I am proud of the efforts of this working group's report addressing our critical mineral supply chains. The Earth Sciences and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024 will enhance international collaboration, ensuring sustainable development and supply chain security. The amendments to the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 will protect our domestic industries from foreign adversaries while supporting battery recycling. Lastly, the Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act is essential for building a skilled workforce to meet our future needs. Together, these initiatives reflect our commitment to national security and economic resilience,""* **said Rep. Torres.**

* The *Earth Sciences and Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024* authorizes and appropriates funds for the Secretary of the Interior to enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with foreign governments to facilitate collaboration on earth sciences and critical mineral supply chains. These agreements encourage cooperation with foreign government and private sector entities, to advance geologic mapping, mineral resource assessment, data analysis, and training in environmental and workplace standards. MOUs also facilitate partnerships between U.S. entities, including government agencies, universities, and private companies, with their foreign counterparts. The Act emphasizes collaboration with partner countries that are strategic allies or critical mineral sources, fostering sustainable development and supply chain security.
* The Act authorizes $3 million for fiscal year 2025, requiring funding to directly advance MOUs. Remaining funds may be used for critical mineral data collection and shared data management initiatives with partner countries. Additionally, the Act encourages broader participation from scientists, international organizations, and other stakeholders. By leveraging international cooperation and geoscientific expertise, the Act aims to enhance the United States’ ability to manage critical mineral resources, improve supply chain resiliency, and reduce reliance on foreign adversaries for essential materials.

 

[**Amendment to the Export Reform Control Act of 2018**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/WITTMA_118_xml.pdf)

 

* The proposed bill amends the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 to implement export controls on black mass (recycled lithium-ion battery material) and swarf (magnet manufacturing byproducts) to prevent exploitation by foreign adversaries, particularly the PRC. The bill aims to strengthen domestic critical mineral supply chains, support battery recycling and processing industries, and counter PRC market manipulation.
* Under the legislation, a license will be required for the export, re-export, or in-country transfer of black mass and swarf if the end-user is a foreign adversary or related entity. Applications for these licenses would be denied to foreign adversaries, including PRC entities with direct or indirect government, military, or CCP influence.
* The bill seeks to facilitate the sustainable recycling and recovery of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel from spent batteries; enhance U.S. processing capabilities; and limit adversarial control over essential materials. By restricting exports of recyclable materials containing critical minerals, the legislation seeks to bolster U.S. industries and reduce reliance on adversarial nations for strategically significant resources.

 

[**Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act**](https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/TORRNY_210_xml.pdf)

 

* The Critical Minerals Workforce Enhancement Act aims to strengthen the U.S. workforce in mining, refining, processing, and recycling critical minerals by amending key education and workforce laws. The bill introduces a national interest waiver under the Immigration and Nationality Act to allow foreign engineers specializing in critical minerals to work full-time in the U.S. for businesses or government agencies, fostering domestic expertise in critical mineral production and recycling.
* Additionally, the bill amends the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 to promote international educational exchanges focused on critical minerals. It enables U.S. citizens to study abroad at specialized institutions and facilitates enrollment of foreign students in U.S. programs related to critical minerals. The legislation encourages educational partnerships, research collaborations, joint degree programs, and training initiatives between U.S. and foreign institutions. It also provides funding for scholarships, fellowships, and grants to support professional development in critical minerals sectors globally.
* By addressing workforce gaps through targeted workforce reforms and fostering international educational collaboration, the Act seeks to ensure a robust and skilled labor force capable of meeting the growing demand for critical minerals essential to national security and clean energy technologies.

We are looking to have our own place together, but he brought up recently that I correct him vocally when he is cleaning pretty often. It’s made him feel like I am watching him, and being overly critical. 

Usually I try to not frame the correction as criticism, but as a suggestion, like “Oh, if you can, would you do the coffee filter first so we dont get fish sauce on it” or “I try to dust before I sweep so I don’t have to sweep twice” etc.

We have different backgrounds, he is white, an only child, and grew up with more access to wealth than me. I share this because I was definitely expected to clean a lot more than him growing up. As an adult I have worked as a janitor. He is very self aware in most respects, and usually is open to listening and being corrected when needed (and I try to be too!) 

How can I work on being so critical and letting some stuff go? I don’t care that I am tidier than he is, but when things are really dirty it stresses me out and triggers a lot of shame stuff for me.",6,1734033465.0,TMPOC,1,1.0,False

Essential Collaboration in Library Architecture

 

**a guest post by** [**Fred Schlipf and Joe Huberty** ](https://www.alastore.ala.org/phla2)

The construction of library buildings is one of most expensive and permanent undertakings facing libraries. If you buy an ill-considered book, it can be dumped into the next book sale. An uncomfortable chair you never tried out before ordering can be put in the staff lunchroom. But a badly conceived building can be around for a century, leading to miseries for endless users and staff members yet unborn—or amazingly expensive (if not impossible) remodeling.

One of the things that leads to unsatisfactory library buildings is the failure of all the groups involved to work smoothly together. There are more groups than one might first think:

* **Owners**, including universities, cities, schools, and corporations.
* **Users**, including people who borrow materials, work or study in libraries, depend on libraries for assistance, spend time in libraries, attend events in libraries, and have coffee in libraries while watching the world go by. And people who don’t use libraries, sometimes for very relevant reasons.
* **Librarians**, including local library managers, library staff, and hired experts on library building functionality. If none of the library staff have experience with library building planning, a librarian with a background in library building planning needs to be hired and participate in the process.
* **Architects and all the specialists who work with them**, including engineers, interior planners, and landscapers. While architects with no experience with libraries can design very workable buildings, the chances of success are vastly greater if the architects have prior and successful experience constructing library buildings that owners and librarians can visit before selecting architects.
* **Donors**, including library foundations, library friends groups, and individual donors, all of whom may accompany their gifts with strong opinions. On occasion, donor opinions are totally unworkable, pointing to the wisdom of designing first and finding a donor second.
* **Administrators**, including university boards of trustees, university administrations, faculty library committees, city councils, mayors, public library boards, school boards, and school administrators.
* **Technical experts**, including campus architects, university and city planning staff, city technical staff, and code enforcement specialists, all of whom play a crucial role in defining what types of buildings can be built where and how.
* **Fundraising experts**, including university and city fundraising offices and library foundations.

While all of these groups need to be consulted from time to time, others need to be present at all planning meetings.

**Among the absolutely essential groups who need to be present at all times are owners, architects, and librarians.** One of the signs of disastrous library planning is the intentional omission of any of those three essential groups, especially the omission of librarians. If a provost or mayor or high school principal insists on meeting privately with the architect, expect serious problems.

How do libraries keep out of trouble?

* **Never select architects without both the owners and the librarians present.**
* **Never make important decisions without owners, librarians, and architects present.** In particular, beware of meetings without librarians present. (When people announce that the next meeting won’t need librarians present, librarians need to be sure to attend.)
* **Making decisions without all three groups present leads to a lot of wasted time getting all three groups together later.** Or it can lead to the omission of essential input from one of the groups, which sometimes results in serious design mistakes.
* **Beware of people with axes to grind.** Often these involve money. Owners of obsolete buildings may hope to unload them on their local public libraries. People may decide to combine different types of libraries that have nothing in common with each other, in the hope this will save money, ignoring a wide variety of basic planning issues in the process. Or they can combine library buildings with non-library buildings, failing to separate the two functions and leading to problems with security, acoustics, and other basic necessities.
* **Be aware of owners’ motivations, which may have more to do with saving money or improving a bad area of town or campus than providing library service.** Some concepts appear to be driven only by visions of bargains rather than by visions of fine libraries.
* **Beware of proposed designs that excite the designers but nobody else.**
* **Never let an architect initially propose a single idea.** Ideas need to emerge through discussion, not be revealed in a sudden blaze of glory.
* **Beware of librarians who demand everything every staff member requests, regardless of cost.**
* **Site selection is always a group process.** Never let a non-library agency dictate your site without discussion of functional needs by librarians, library users, and architects.
* **The unworkability of ideas can be made clear by simple architectural sketches and accompanying cost estimates.** If you don’t test ideas this way, some people will never abandon them.
* **Avoid situations where team members can be intimidated.** Librarians are the most vulnerable team members, and it can help to have an outside library specialist there to speak up and then be dismissed in revenge for offending the mayor or the provost.
* **Always strenuously ban all situations where new ideas are sprung on people at a meeting with a requirement for instant action.**

The design and construction of library buildings is far more complex than many people realize. It involves a seemingly endless consideration of hundreds of details rather than a handful of sweeping rules. Librarians need to be aware of what works—and doesn’t work—before embarking on projects. And they need to be alert to protecting their libraries’ interests.

Collaboration is an essential approach to successful library buildings.

\* Viszont ha a célország mondjuk Ausztria, ahol kötelező a téli gumi, amennyiben nyárival megyek a téli időszakban látogatóba, úgy megbírságol(hat)nak. Mivel itthon nem kötelező, így miért a külföldi ország törvénye igaz rám?

Tudom két külön ország, külön jogrendszer. Amennyiben tudtok példát azonos országból, aminek az alkalmazásai így ellent mondanak, akkor magyarázzátok azzal kérlek, mert jogilag pontosabb.

(Valamint hozzátenném, hogy tudtommal csak a diplomatákra igaz az, hogy az anyaországának a törvényei vonatkoznak rá, amennyiben kiküldetésen van külföldön. Viszont mivel nem vagyok jogban nagyon otthon kérlek pontosítsatok!)",0,1734033101.0,joghungary,1,0.5,False
1hctnb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/home_coffee_roasting/comments/1hctnb0/roast_level_terminology_a_quick_reference_guide/,Roast Level Terminology - A Quick Reference Guide,"#**Roast Level Terminology - A Quick Reference Guide**

While using color meters and calculating moisture loss are usually the preferred ways to assess roast level, not everyone starting out has access to these tools, and may want to just get a general idea of roast level terminology. 

Keep in mind that terminology for roast level varies from roaster to roaster. Terms like “light, medium, dark” are used differently by each roaster and there is no standard definition for these terms (one roaster’s “light roast” might be another’s “darkest roast” and vice-versa). A more standardized roasting language exists among roasters (city, city plus, full city, full city plus, etc.) and, while these terms can also vary from roaster to roaster, it is a little more standardized and universal. 

With all that said, the below reference guide can be used to determine your roast level by temperature and other characteristics of your roast. It’s a general guide and shouldn’t be seen as a set of rules. 

| Roast Level | Sometimes aka | Temperature (F° / C° | Description |
|:—|:—:|:—:|—:|
|**Cinnamon** | Ultra-light roast | (385 °F / 196 °C) | Very beginning of 1st crack. ""Drinkable” but grassy taste/underdeveloped. |
|**City** | Light Roast | (400 °F / 205 °C) | Beginning to mid 1st crack. |
|**City +** | Medium-Light Roast | (405 - 410 °F / 207 - 210 °C) | Tail end of 1st crack, may be hearing the last 1st cracks. Depending on roaster may be hearing the first couple 2nd cracks if you roast very quickly. Should be no visible oil on the beans. |
|**Full City** | Medium Roast | (410 - 415 °F / 210 - 213°C) | 1st crack has ended but 2nd crack has not begun. No oil to a few flecks of oil. A bit more smoke coming from roaster and sometimes you'll see a big puff indicating the beginning of the 2nd crack. |
|**Full City +** | Medium-Dark roast | (415 - 430 °F / 213 - 221 °C) | Just a few snaps into 2nd crack. No oil to a few flecks of oil. |
|**Vienna** | Lightest of the Dark Roasts | (430 - 440 °F / 221 - 227 °C) | Mid 2nd crack (or about 10-20 seconds into a consistent 2nd crack, and not just a few cracks here and there). Clear sheen of oil on most beans. More smoke coming from roaster. Flavor: less acidic and brightness, least bitter of the dark roasts. |
| **French** | Darker spectrum of the Dark Roasts | (440 - 455 °F / 227 - 235 °C) | End of 2nd crack, usually after exceeding 30 seconds of consistent cracking (Cracking tapering off, but still rolling for the most part). Covered in a sheen of oil that is unmistakable. Lots of smoke coming from roaster. 
Bean color more grey-black than brown. Flavor: burnt undertone, very little acidity or brightness, and often higher bitterness. |
|**Italian/Spanish** | Too Dark | (Over 455 °F / 235 °C) | Almost black color. Tons of smoke from roaster. Aroma of burning tires. High bitterness, virtually no detectable acidity or brightness. Last resort/emergency coffee. 
Anything slightly above this is charcoal and a potential fire hazard. |",1,1734033089.0,home_coffee_roasting,0,1.0,False

**Looking for something fun to do this Saturday morning?** **Come to Bike the Bridge (or walk/roll)!**

We’re excited to invite all of you to celebrate the grand opening of the new bike and pedestrian bridge over SR 520 just east of the Montlake Boulevard lid. Join us for the official opening in Seattle's Montlake neighborhood!

We'll have hot cocoa, coffee, tea and snacks to share starting at 11 a.m. this Saturday, Dec. 14! After a few welcoming words at 11:30 a.m., we'll officially open the bridge and start walking/riding/rolling. Afterwards you're welcome to join our team on a guided tour around the area at the Montlake Lid or have your bike fixed FOR FREE by the Montlake Bike Shop.

* Location: New bike and pedestrian bridge, just east of the Montlake Lid. Access the bridge from the SR 520 Trail, Bill Dawson Trail, or along Lake Washington Boulevard via the Montlake Lid.
* Parking: Limited street parking nearby—carpooling, walking/biking/rolling or taking transit is encouraged! Please walk, bike, or roll to the west entrance of the bridge, near the SR 520 Trail, if you're able to! You will see signs and staff around the site to help find your way to the event.

This is a major milestone as it is one of the last steps in the SR 520 Montlake project, which has involved many closures of both directions of SR 520 across the lake over the last few years. Rain or shine, this is an event you won’t want to miss! Join us for music, refreshments, a family-friendly coloring station and tours as we celebrate this milestone together.

We are looking to have our own place together, but he brought up recently that I correct him vocally when he is cleaning pretty often. It’s made him feel like I am watching him, and being overly critical. 

Usually I try to not frame the correction as criticism, but as a suggestion, like “Oh, if you can, would you do the coffee filter first so we dont get fish sauce on it” or “I try to dust before I sweep so I don’t have to sweep twice” etc.

We have different backgrounds, he is white, an only child, and grew up with more access to wealth than me. I share this because I was definitely expected to clean a lot more than him growing up. As an adult I have worked as a janitor. He is very self aware in most respects, and usually is open to listening and being corrected when needed (and I try to be too!) 

How can I work on being so critical and letting some stuff go? I don’t care that I am tidier than he is, but when things are really dirty it stresses me out and triggers a lot of shame stuff for me.",1,1734033058.0,asktransgender,2,1.0,False

1hctm38,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hctm38,Under extracting on purpose? (breville barista),"Recently got my a Breville Barista express as my first espresso machine and have been loving the learning process. 
I had a friend gift me some freshly roasted beans once I dialed it in it tasted amazing. 
My second bag is a very dark roast that out the bag smells pretty burned and strong. It is from a really reputable roaster in Denver (Kalade). 
My question is: after doing everything according to recommendations like measuring how much goes in, grinding to where the pressure gauge is in the espresso range, timing the pull and getting a 1:2 ratio in 25ish seconds the coffee taste horribly burned and bitter.
Today I decided to grind it really coarse (from a 9 to a 14 on the dial) and pulled a shot at 25 seconds that the pressure gauge was too low (on the under extracted side) and somehow it tastes great, had great thick crema and a great texture. It did pull a higher volume of almost 1:3. 
Is this normal with some darker roasts? Do you sometimes go off based on what might work vs using the pressure gauge to determine proper extraction?

I always planned to study for law school and just go for that but faculty casually brought up an MA in our department and after some very careful thought I've decided to apply to that first instead, before tackling the law school part of my journey.

My bachelor's has in no way been normal nor linear. While my grades aren't terrible, I don't think my profs were thrilled about my asking for extensions or absences--Not that there were many absences, but coming up with reason after reason for an extension (most of which involved family matters or personal issues) might be understandable but also very annoying to keep presenting! It doesn't make me come off as a very reliable or trustworthy student I'm guessing.

I'm trying to think of my strategy for gathering references, and it's coming down to the wire now anyways. So, despite what I think my bachelor's experience was, should I contact most of them anyways? Most of my profs are from this department or directly involved in this MA. Or, to save my dignity and what little opinion those people might have of me, do I just pick a handful of profs I have the best shot of getting a reference from, some of whom are not actually from this department. Admittedly, actually, one of the profs who I wish I could reach out to since they're a part of the MA in an integral way and a prof I've had twice before, witnessed my emergency-hospital rush in his very class one afternoon--I'd imagine maybe he could sympathize but I also worry I stretched my relationship with him since I've already asked for extensions from him at that time (and before too).

My plan to ask for a reference, regardless of who I reach out to, is to ask via email after I re-introduce myself, include some information about what I've been up to and my goals, provide my transcript and/or resume/Linkedin, offer a coffee chat, and remark at what I enjoyed or remember about their course/explain why I am reaching out to them.

**Any experience you have about getting references while in maybe a dubious situation like I am is helpful or any advice as to what I should proceed with is great.**

*Stress rant:* I am feeling so unconfident. I already worried about my own capabilities with my mental and physical health being a mess so it's taking every ounce of courage to apply at all, but now I'm so worried at being scoffed at for asking.

I’d like to get them something to show my appreciation for always making the most amazing coffee and being some of the nicest people ive met,

2. If yes, what do you recommend? Cupcakes, gift cards, something else?

1hctil8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hctil8/need_advice_on_battling_extreme_fatiuge/,Need advice on battling extreme fatiuge,"I just recently changed jobs to a 9-5 office job. Before that I worked at a school which I couldn't cope in. When I started at the school (which was also my first full time job) my energy levels went from okay, could be better, to non existent and struggling everyday. I would go work, finish and slump into a nap around 4-6 pm. Even though I'm in a new job which I am much happier in and finally content with work, my energy levels are still rubbish.

I've struggled with sleep most of my life anyway, being diagnosed with insomnia young and then hypersomnia when I left school. I think the intial reason I started sleeping so much was that my mom finally broke up with her partner of 7 years who was abusing me emotionally and mentally. I read somewhere that once people in an abusive situation leave it or are out of it, their body goes into a sort of hibernation mode. Since then I can easily switch my body off and go to sleep whenever I want, even if I'm not tired.

I was also on prescribed Melatonin from the age of 5 to 18 for autism. I stopped as they had a big play in my sleep.

If I didn't have hobbies, this wouldn't be a problem, but my energy levels are coming in the way of my personal life. I used to go the gym almost every day of the week before starting full time, and I would play my video games a little bit in the evening. Now I'm struggling to do both. It's bothering me so much because I enjoy going to the gym and playing my games as they just simply keep me happy, but my body a lot of times physically can't even play games and I just die in bed. This makes me feel like a piece of dog poop. I miss going to the gym. I'm even trying to balance it where I go gym one day and the next day I play my games, so that everything I want to do isn't always clumped into one day, but even that is hard. Not going the gym makes me more insecure of my body.

I feel like there's a formula to this and I'm missing it. My diet is okay, I'm trying to start clean eating and I make sure I have enough protein everyday. I also take vitamins to tackle my sleep. I think they help a bit but I need to remember to take them everday to actually know or not. I have coffee everyday, so maybe caffine is a big play as to why I die in the afternoon/eveing, but it's hard not to have a nice warm coffee in the morning. I tried decaf coffee but it makes my stomach turn.

I've been battling fatigue for years, but it's becoming a bigger problem the past few months since I switched to full time. Sometimes I think 'it is what it is' and I just have to accept going to work then having a nap, but I can never have a short nap. Today I had a nap from 4pm to 6:30pm. If my naps were no more than an hour, and I'd feel refreshed after them, life would be great. But I can only feel refreshed from 2 hour naps.

Some advice would be great. I'm not sure how to battle it. I have asked for blood checks to see if I'm low on anything but GPs in the UK love to take time on this kind of stuff. I miss doing stuff I enjoy, which is gym and video games, but it's hard to fit everything in the week, and I really don't want to give up the gym as that helps me so much.",1,1734032747.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

A little bit about me: I'm a 2022 college grad who moved to NYC soon after graduating and have been here since. 

The last two jobs I've held were customer success roles at tech companies. The first was more about creating website A/B tests, upselling, renewal rates, managing a portfolio of clients, etc. and the most recent job has been more traditional tech support (helping people use our software).

Both jobs were stressful and time consuming in their own ways. The former having an unattainable quota and the latter an on call component where you had to answer customers before and after normal work hours. I recently quit to work at a print shop while I figure out my next career move.

As I near the approach the ancient age of 25, I'm curious to hear from fellow Redditors with marketing jobs they actually enjoy. I'm considering transitioning into marketing roles since I have some experience in graphic design and social media, and I like that these roles often involve creativity. However, I know ""marketing"" covers a wide range of paths and specialties. I'd love to hear about your experiences and the kind of work you do.

So... if you don't hate your marketing job it would be awesome if you could share a little bit about what your day to day looks like and how you entered the field. Bonus points if you would let me DM you to ask more questions, hop on a call, or if local grab a bite, coffee, or a drink.

She gives a great historical breakdown about ethics vs economics which I really enjoyed.  Around the 30 minute mark she says something along the lines of ""Everything you've ever needed is just sitting there on the store shelves, but between you and and your ability to live your life is a number (price) and a man with a gun.  And the man with the gun fucking hates you.  But the moment you're free, you just take it.""

**1) What?  Why does the man hate you?**  That man is trying to put food on the table like so many other working class people. The list of 100% ethical occupations is not very long. That doesn't mean the Walmart security guard is a bloodied pinkerton.  They often aren't even cops.

**2) What? You just take it because you're ""free""?** We do not yet live in a post-capitalist society.  Stealing goods hurts already exploited workers.  Prop, a guest on the show, talked extensively in an episode about better-than-fair-trade coffee.  He detailed how the project he's working on shows how every dollar you pay goes to farmers, artisans, shippers, and stockers to get coffee beans into your pantry.  It was inspiring, exciting, and it gave me hope for transitioning into a better system.

**3) ""What if this didn't have a price?""** Mia concludes with restating this question that underpins our questioning of capitalism.  What if your ability to obtain necessary goods wasn't tied to fake points that you earn by selling your time?   I agree that this is a good question to explore. BUT, goods do have a very real ""price"" outside of monetary cost.  The cost of coffee, for example, is land, water, labor, healthcare for those involved, fossil fuels, etc. etc.  If the US were to break out of this cooperate stranglehold, we would still need to compensate the people (many of which are outside of the US) for their blood, sweat, and tears.  Therefore, there would still have to be a price, regardless if the consumer saw it or not. (Obviously, we all, Mia included, know this. I'm just trying to bring the focus back from a abstract, yet useful, question.)

I just feel like Mia is grounded and knowledgeable enough to see that the people she is ""othering"" includes working class people.  Look, I'm not coming to bat for capitalists or anyone making well above their needs.  I sympathize with people who need to steal to survive.  We need to do better as a society.  But what Mia presents there atomizes people into non-cohesive ""free"" individuals who just assume that working people upholding the status quo automatically hate you.  This is not the way forward, IMO.

TLDR: The problem isn't price, it is ***undue profit.***

For the past year, I have been deconstructing.  Now I understand what this means.  I am just going over every belief I used to “know was right” and re-examining it to see if I still believe that or if that has changed.  Many of my beliefs have changed drastically and I know God and love Him so much and spend time with Him and I am actually close to Him now and didn’t know Him before at all!  

In conclusion, I would say don’t freak out over people deconstructing!  Almost everyone I’ve met that has deconstructed is healthier and in a much better place now than they were before.  I have more examples if you want…one of my friends was raised a missionary and now just owns a coffee shop but is the biggest helper for homeless people in the entire city.  Living out the love.

 Love to everyone on here, Christian or not.  ",7,1734031767.0,Christianity,14,0.82,False

I felt happy and extremely joyful. I immediately got a job at a company and felt amazing that I was going to get a salary and have fun in life. Poor me, I didn't realize there was a dark side to that. I woke up every day at 6 AM and returned home at 8 PM, and rarely 9 PM, meeting and working with toxic colleagues and managers that made my life a living hell. All my managers thought about were project goals, and all my coworkers showed competition. I've always been the kind of person whom everybody likes because I'm sweet and don't like getting involved in problems or talking behind others. But later, I found myself leaning towards that behavior and became somewhat toxic, though not intentionally hurting anyone.

Now, at the end of 2024, I've changed jobs a couple of times and am still working just for the money, not out of passion. My friends are all focused on career evolution and raising their salaries. At this moment, I've realized it's all about me, and if I'm not considering career evolution or a salary raise, that doesn't make me less of a person. Everyone should make their own choices. I don't want to work long hours just to be called a Manager. I am a Manager now, and my job requires me to be 100% focused and work extra hours, but this is not who I am. I'm the kind of person who is interested in culture, meeting new people, talking... I want to work fewer hours, do a job, and go out enjoying the weather, having coffee... and not be stuck in a company with toxic people. I should also mention that I used to take antidepressants for 3 years.

I'm 28 years old, and I feel my life is running, and I haven't figured out yet how to build myself.

I understand loss of sleep after becoming a parent is 100000% just plain reality. 

He’s never been a fantastic sleeper. When we transitioned from crib to big boy bed, he’d come into our room so many times during the night. My husband or I would fall asleep on his floor putting him back to bed. We’d eventually wake up and go back into our room. 3 minutes later he’d be right there to get me up again. 

Now he’s almost 5 (in April) and still wakes me up constantly. For anything and everything. A hug, to fill his water, because he has to go potty. One time last night he woke me up because he wanted to put baby Vicks on his feet; we haven’t been sick in weeks. 

I never fight him on waking up because I tell myself he’ll outgrow it. But yall, I’m tired. 

I work at a coffee shop, I get up at 325 in the morning on the days I work. Like CLOCKWORK he is there at 3am waking me up because he wants to tell me goodbye before I leave for work (I leave at 350am).

Even the days I don’t work, he still wakes me up anywhere from 2-5 times a night. 

How do I break this? I try my damn HARDEST to be as patient as I can throughout the night. Most of the time I’m sleepwalking to be honest. But it’s taking a toll. I’m 5 months pregnant with a surrogate baby and I am always tired. 

I don’t know how to explain how tired I am to a 4.5 year old who gets 10+ hours of sleep a night. Who doesn’t have to get up and go to work exhausted. Any advice? Anyone relate to this? Sorry this is long winded but I needed to just get it out so badly.

I started at 211lb in Jan 2024. I saw a nutritionist on 7/1, (around 208-210, negligible loss), and now I'm down reliability to 196. so that's like 15\~ lbs. pretty good for 6 mo!

Today, I eat a lot less, I'm less hungry, and I work out more. I don't crash and that's due to I think a good (for me) diet.  Weight is coming off faster in December due to athletics. I'll be 190 by Jan easily.

1) thank you to everyone who took the time to elaborate on their process or answer a question I asked. 

2) here's what worked for me, thanks to this sub, and a nutritionist. It's pretty simple, but it's a lot of words. I hope this helps someone. 

I eat a lot more protein proportionally. It's whole, simple, real food that I myself cook. I am privileged to work from home, and do it this way, and privileged that I can eat simple foods that are nourishing. If I have meat, say raw ground turkey - I go by the packaging label (USA). If a serving size is 4oz, 160 cal, and it says there's 4 servings there, and then I check the front of the package and it says 16oz ground turkey, then I have my calorie count accurately. I use frozen rice bags and do not count vegetables like peppers. Potatos etc. I do count. Rice math is worse than restaurant receipt math. Don't @ me haha.

So at 205-2010 lbs in July (water weight fluctuations etc), I was given 2800 calories to work with, and 2400 if I wanted to lose weight. That turned out to be very accurate. Before then, I massively undercounted and my nutritionist called that out (""1800 does not work for you"") , I was restricting and binging if that's a term. By evening, I would be ravenous. That doesn't happen now thankfully. 

I have been losing a straight line (if you do a regression or like a y = mx + b) of 0.75lbs weekly since I saw that nutritionist. It's so eery, and was the same in October and November. Spot on.

A sample day: (Big Bfast, Medium Lunch, Snack, Small Dinner, Snack)

Trader Joe's Marathon Bread (2), 3 eggs, a yogurt cup or two, and a banana. sometimes a scone. Coffee black. 800-1000 calories.  Orrrr potatoes, pepper and onion, eggs, yogurt, fruit.

Lunch: Sweetgreen salad or my own, rice/sweet potato, chicken or beef like 400-600 calories

Snack: Apple and Yogurt 300 calories

Dinner: Ground turkey and vegetables like 400 calories or less

Snack: Whole Foods Fruit cup and yogurt 150-300 calories

I'm pretty flexible, except for that fruit cup. You're going to have to pry that from my cold fruity hands.

So that's 2600 calories give or take. Pardon my math. I was very deliberate and spreadsheety in July/August but I found my body told me what it needed after a few months.

Rules: I still don't cook with oil (it's all instant pot or dutch oven, and the meat doesn't stick nor do the vegetables). No booze until I'm like 160lbs - I don't lose weight at all if I'm drinking. And I try to limit my sodium.

The biggest change: My nutritionist told me to fucking eat, and eat for my activities. I also eat classical nutritious food. Like Whole30 type. And Yogurt changed my life - I must have been deficient in stuff before this. 

I'm so grateful. This sub is super nice. I'm not a doc, this isn't advice, it's just what worked for me. Turns out my parents had the right advice when I was growing up. 

Consistent effort was required. Consistent mindfulness. Never beat myself up, and never punished myself. I was told 'dont' let it get to the point of hunger' and that worked for me. Strong workouts all year.

Doing 25+ mile days, long water carries, dry camping, cold weather, snow etc is all stuff I'm comfortable with.

I've been looking for a 5 day trip mid-january somewhere in the southwest. I originally wanted to do a trip in the grand canyon, but I couldn't stomach paying $400 to leave a rental car sitting at the south rim for my hike being unused, and transit in that area is not really feasible/ worth the hassle.

I have been instead looking at doing a loop in the Superstition range that's east of Pheonix. I threw together a 5 day 4 night ~50mi loop that starts/ends  at the Lost Dutchman campground. Here's a link to the route:

Trails | Details

Jacob's Crosscut |
First Water Trail | forest road 78?
Grand Enchantment Trail (GET)| aka Dutchman trail
Red Tanks Trail| also GET?
Hoolie Bacon Trail| also GET?
JF Trail | also GET?
Coffee Flat Trail | 
Dutchman Trail |
Peralta Trail |
Superstition Ridgeline Trail | trail to Flatiron
Siphon Draw Trail | 

I've briefly checked each of these trails and while some of them aren't heavily traveled they all seem passable.

What I need help with is this:

1) Is it easy/doable to uber, shuttle, or hitch from PHX to that trailhead (Lost Dutchman campground)? if not, any other easier entry points to the superstitions for someone without a car?

2) what's the best way to plan my water carries? I've been a bit spoiled by using FarOut for most of my planning on previous trips and that's not available here. My map shows plenty of water sources but from what I've read most of them will be dry. I'm comfortable dry camping and carrying water but if my route is going to put me on a 30 mile dry stretch or something it will be an issue.

4) low temps are expected and I'm fine with hiking through snow, but should I expect any sections of this route to be treacherously icy or snowy? I'm a little worried about the descent from the Flatiron, it's supposed to be kind of scary even during the summer. 


I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask these questions, posting to /r/arizona seemed like the wrong audience and the subreddit for the superstitions is tiny and inactive.

Here are some insights from Redditors on how to meet women and build meaningful connections:

# Be Social and Engage in Conversations

* **Talk to Everyone**: One Redditor shared that their ex-boyfriend talked to nearly everyone he encountered, which made it easier to transition from friendly interactions to finding a woman. [""Just talk to people in general, that way it'll be easier to talk to a woman you're interested in.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wzgoq0/comment/im2wi56/)
* **Overcome Fear of Rejection**: Another Redditor emphasized that worrying about what people think can hold you back. Approaching women isn't creepy if done respectfully. [""Approaching women you find attractive isn’t creepy. It’s normal.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wzgoq0/comment/im2i1n4/)

# Utilize Dating Apps Wisely

* **Be Selective and Realistic**: One Redditor advised keeping your expectations realistic and not talking to too many people at once. [""You should not have like more than 5 guys that you are talking to at the same time.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1h301cd/comment/lznavt2/)
* **Choose the Right Platform**: Different apps cater to different demographics. For serious relationships, consider apps like Hinge or Bumble. [""If you’re looking for a relationship, use hinge or bumble rather than Tinder.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/tz4utx/comment/i3xd8xr/)

# Join Social Groups and Activities

* **Develop Your Social Circle**: Engaging in clubs, groups, and organizations can help you meet new people. [""The best way to meet women is by developing your social circle.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/k6oi6m/comment/gem4wec/)
* **Attend Events and Meetups**: Participating in events related to your interests can naturally lead to meeting like-minded women. [""Join meetup.com, there has to be at least one group you would be interested in.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wzgoq0/comment/im2wi56/)

# Improve Yourself and Be Confident

* **Self-Improvement**: Constantly work on improving yourself, whether it's through fitness, hobbies, or personal development. [""Constantly improve yourself.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/k6oi6m/comment/gemazas/)
* **Be Direct and Honest**: When you meet someone you're interested in, be upfront about your intentions. [""If you come across a girl you are into, ask her for coffee or tea.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/43ojn3/comment/czjtsng/)

# Be Mindful of Social Dynamics

* **Understand Social Cues**: Pay attention to how women respond to your advances. If a woman looks at you multiple times, it might be a sign to approach her. [""If a girl looks at you consistently or multiple times in a row. You smile and you make an approach.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/wzgoq0/comment/im2jzzt/)
* **Avoid Overthinking**: Sometimes, overthinking can lead to missed opportunities. [""If you’re looking for a relationship, use hinge or bumble rather than Tinder.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/tz4utx/comment/i3xd8xr/)",1,1734031324.0,redditaiadvice,0,1.0,False

I’m deeply empathetic and emotionally available, and I value authenticity in myself and in others. During the week, I’m a homebody who recharges with simple comforts, but on weekends, I run a women’s social club that I’ve worked hard to build. I love going out with the group to try coffee shops, restaurants, and cultural activities.

Ideally, I’d love to meet someone artistic and creative to balance out my technical skills—someone who can fill life with color, music, and imagination. I’m currently childfree but open to seriously discussing having kids—it’s something I’d want us to decide together as a team.

I’m building a life that’s true to me, and while I hope to stay in my area long-term, I’m open to long-distance for the right person. If this resonates with you, don’t be shy—reach out! I’d love to hear your story and see where it takes us.

1hcsqnv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1hcsqnv/learning_to_navigate_society/,Learning to navigate society,"It's kind of a vent, but I want advice. The type of advice I want is at the bottom of the post. 

  
So, I have recently entered college, and it's been tough. Maybe I'll sound a bit self-centred when I talk about this, but I kind of want to get this off my chest and see who else has experienced similar issues. Why? Because I want to know what they did about it and if they were seeing this the way I was.

  
The background to all of this is that I was always kind of ignored or left alone. I liked that—being given my own space to exist, and then, if I felt like it, I would socialize with some people. It was easier to make small talk then. In all my years of school, I was left alone to do my own thing, and nobody really bothered me for it.

  
That was until my senior year of high school and my first semester of college. For some reason, everyone kept talking about me. I don't know most of these people, but those people somehow know my name. I made a painting toward the end of senior year, and two girls, who I don't remember speaking to, congratulated me by name, and that kind of freaked me out a little. I mean, they were nice, but what? I don't know how to explain it, but that really rubbed me the wrong way.

  
Then, when we were doing icebreakers for the first semester of college, literally everyone kind of ignored me and avoided talking to me. Even the RAs hosting this thing caught onto this. Luckily, at that time, my roommate didn’t give me crap, but that eventually soured. In general, people kind of kept talking about me when they saw me, making sure I could hear them. They’d never talk to me, though. It got to a point where I wasn’t sure who to really socialize with, because everyone seemed to have a negative opinion about me already. I just decided to kind of isolate myself—it's okay to be alone, and if nobody wants to talk, then nobody wants to talk. I still have one friend from high school, and I really love this friend. I am not completely alone because it seems like those who matter are still by my side.

  
Okay, so maybe I don’t have the cleanest track record, but at the same time, I don’t know how to register this.

  
I had some conflicts with a previous roommate. Maybe, from my end, I was a bit reckless in my approach to fixing things, and I didn’t compromise on certain things either. Eventually, it got bad enough, so I switched rooms. I don’t know if she or her friends really let it go, though. People still kept acting up around me. They’d talk about me but never to me. They’d say stuff to try and provoke me. Everyone was trying to find ways to say that I am a bad person, but I don’t even know their names. Why are they so invested in my life? My life is just one singular person trying to get by somehow. During that time, I looked angry all the time, and I’d maybe give dirty looks to people I thought were trying to provoke me. I know that I shouldn’t give them that much credit, but damn, they made me really upset.

  
It’s the end of the semester now, and yeah... all the ostracism kind of tapered off. People don’t talk to me, but they don’t treat me like crap, so that’s something. Maybe they don’t find it fun to pull that stuff anymore because they probably have finals to study for. Which is nice—I can eat my food without feeling like I am being observed and sit comfortably in the cafeteria for once. 

There is a problem, though...

  
Essentially, a person and his friend were chatting. I don't know, I wasn't sure if they were talking about me or not. They didn't have that same snarky tone that was referring to me most of the time. If anything, they seemed nice. I figured that maybe they were talking about someone else. But then, the ambiguity of it really made me unsettled because of the contents of their conversation. What they were saying could apply to anyone, and I felt ashamed that I ascribed it to myself. My emotions were going haywire. I was pretty much finished with my meal, so I chugged my coffee and ran off. Then, I had a mental breakdown in my dorm room. It wasn’t long before my next class, so I left my dorm room after ten minutes. I might have made the person sitting next to me in that class uncomfortable because I was still feeling those emotions. They didn’t go away no matter how hard I tried.

  
I think it’s important to note that whenever I feel like I can socialize with some people, something happens where I kind of lose trust in them and then back away. It’s usually because they start acting strange and distant or over-invested in what I am doing, and so then I know that they’re probably crap-talking me. That’s a problem because then that means I have to prove to them that I am not a bad person. I shouldn’t have to prove myself like that to anyone. Sometimes there are people who seem gentle and nice. I’d try to make small talk with them. Those conversations make me really happy. The issue is that those things are not frequent occurrences, and not everyone is as friendly.

  
I cannot talk to anyone without being paranoid that they’re probably crap-talking me. What’s worse is that it seems like authority figures might engage in this stuff. I actually overheard TAs and LAs talking about me a couple of times, and that sucked. If TAs and LAs are doing this, then what if it reaches the teachers too? I kind of see that TAs and LAs pretty informally mix with their teachers, and that didn’t help with the paranoia of it. What if this authority figure starts giving me crap in class because of something someone said? I mean, then again, no teacher would be that invested in my life because they have their own things to do, but at the same time, the possibility of it really upsets me.  


So, what I want from this is:

* To figure out how to navigate the issues I am having with TAs, LAs, and Teachers. What if my paranoia is true, and if it is true, how to handle it?
* If there is any flawed thinking and how I can improve.
* How can I navigate society when it is like this? How do I cope with this?
* Why is it happening? How commonly does it happen?",2,1734030736.0,Healthygamergg,1,1.0,False
1hcspza,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1hcspza/i_regret_getting_a_dog/,I regret getting a dog,"I’m a new homeowner that moved away from three dogs. I’ve been back to my family home a few times since then, and each time I left I got sad because I was reminded that I had no one to greet me at home. I thought over it a bit and eventually decided I wanted to adopt, since I work an off shift and don’t have the energy to train a puppy.

I visited the shelter and fell in love with a 1.5yr old dog, he was so shy but he warmed up to me after a few minutes. Fast forward to the start of this week, he got fixed and I picked him up the next day. The first two days everything was fine, no accidents and he knew basic commands. He has skin issues that I knew about and plan on asking the vet for lotion/shampoo recommendations.

He’s been flea biting the ever loving hell out of his paws, and no matter how many times I get him to stop or scrub his paws for him with warm soapy water, he goes right back at it.

I slept on the couch the first two days (since I don’t want him in my room yet because it’s upstairs) to try and ease the transition, today is the first day I’m going back to my bed. I’m up here for not even 10 minutes when I hear him start getting into stuff. That hasn’t happened yet so I’m perplexed and go back downstairs. He had started chewing on a dvd case and peed on my coffee table. He hadn’t had one accident the first 48hrs and I had literally just taken him outside before I decided to call it a day. I watched him pee at least three times.

I had moved the coffee table flush against the couch and positioned the pillows to where he couldn’t jump on it, since my couch cover hasn’t come in yet, so I had to hurriedly clean up the puddle. He’s put in a kennel when I leave the house for work but I didn’t want him in one while I slept, that just feels wrong to have him in one for over half the day.

Idk I’m just overwhelmed and want to cry.

My boyfriend also isn’t much of a dog person, which is fine, but every time I’ve talked about my dog (prior to getting him and then once I had him) conversation died and idkkkkk. I’ve changed my sleep schedule so I can feed my dog and let him out before I leave for work, so that means I go to bed early. My boyfriend is currently in college and works part time. On the days he doesn’t go to school he sleeps allllll day. So the past two days I’ve been settling down when I get a sign of life from him. Idk I feel like my dog has put a small strain on the relationship but I told him before we even became official I had planned on getting a dog eventually. They haven’t even met each other yet. Of course I didn’t think it’d be so soon, and probably shouldn’t have been, but here I am. Here we are. Only 3 days in and I’ve realized I’ve bitten off way more than I can chew.

1hcsmwg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hcsmwg/spanish_learning_vlog/,Spanish learning VLOG,"Hola, language learners! 🌐

After 1.5 years of logging 330 hours of Spanish study (yep, I’m that person who actually tracked the minutes), I’m finally taking my journey public. Today marks the start of not just my Reddit storytelling but also a **YouTube vlog** to hold myself accountable, add some structure, and, most importantly, give myself deadlines — because nothing says “get it done” like the internet watching you.

# The Journey So Far

I’ve been learning Spanish using a comprehensive input method—basically drowning myself in Spanish content like podcasts, books, and yes, even memes. It’s been a wild ride. I’ve had wins, like understanding a full episode of *La Casa de Papel*, and total fails, like the time I messed up slang so badly it sounded… let’s just say ""not what I meant."" 😅

For some background: I’m ADHD with a free-spirited vibe, which means focus and consistency are NOT my strong points. But thanks to stubbornness and a dream of living in Latin America one day, I’ve stuck with it.

# What’s Next?

Inspired by language-learning heroes like **AngelaLearnsSpanish**, who crushed 5-hour study days, I’m stepping things up. Starting now, I’m committing to:

* **75 minutes a day, 5 days a week** (small steps, people!).
* By next year: **150 minutes daily**, building up to that magical 5-hour-a-day grind (send coffee and good vibes, por favor).

# Why the YouTube Vlog?

Let’s be real. When you’ve got ADHD, life, and a 1,000-day language goal all in the mix, staying motivated isn’t easy. So, making videos is my way to:

1. **Stay focused**: Editing myself struggling through Spanish is weirdly motivating.
2. **Create structure**: Vlogs mean deadlines. Deadlines mean progress.
3. **Connect with others**: If you’ve ever thought, “Am I the only one who totally butchered 'mejor'?”—spoiler alert: you’re not.

So now I’m looking at Nespresso machines online.  I feel like I’m cheating of my KCafe+.  😕  I could easily fit a small one next to my Keurig, but how silly would it be to have both?  

Anyway… my question is this:   Are there any kcups that give the crema layer on an espresso shot?  Maybe the Cafe Bustelo just isn’t it.   I’m thinking probably not… but wanted to ask around.  Google is of no help really.

The Benefits of Remote Work: Why Online Jobs are Gaining Popularity
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, remote work has transformed from a niche opportunity to a mainstream option for many workers. More people are seeking online jobs that offer flexibility and convenience. Understanding the benefits of this shift can help you decide if remote work fits your lifestyle.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
### Flexibility and Autonomy

One of the primary advantages of online jobs is the flexibility they provide. Traditional office jobs often require a strict 9-to-5 schedule, whereas remote positions allow you to set your hours. This flexibility means you can choose when you work best—whether you're a morning person or a night owl. It also gives you the freedom to balance other aspects of life, such as family responsibilities or personal projects.

### No Commuting

Commuting can consume a significant amount of time each day. The average commuter spends more than an hour traveling to and from work daily. By working remotely, you can eliminate this time sink entirely. Instead, you can use those hours for productive work or personal activities. This reduction in commuting not only saves time but also decreases stress, leading to better mental health.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
### Cost Savings

Online jobs can also lead to considerable savings. Here are some costs you can cut:

- **Transportation:** No gas, public transport fares, or wear and tear on your vehicle.
- **Lunch and Coffee:** Ditch expensive lunches and coffee runs.
- **Work Attire:** Save on business clothes and footwear.

These savings can improve your financial situation, allowing you to invest in experiences or savings for future goals.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
### Increased Productivity

Many remote workers report higher levels of productivity when compared to their time in traditional offices. The quiet environment of home can help reduce distractions. Moreover, you can create a workspace that suits your needs, whether it’s a cozy corner, a bright kitchen table, or an organized home office. Some studies show that remote workers tend to produce higher-quality work in less time.

### Broader Job Opportunities

Job hunting is often restricted to your local area. However, online jobs open up a world of possibilities. Companies are willing to hire talent from anywhere. This means you can apply for roles that match your skills and interests, regardless of location. Whether you dream of working for a tech startup in Silicon Valley or a marketing agency in London, remote work expands your job search dramatically.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
### Better Work-Life Balance

Remote jobs often provide a better work-life balance. You can integrate personal time with work tasks. Want to take a break for a family gathering or a workout? As long as you meet deadlines, you can often do so at your discretion. This balance leads to improved satisfaction in both your professional and personal life.

### Health Benefits

Working from home can also lead to numerous health benefits:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
- **Less Stress:** No daily commute means less time spent in traffic, which lowers stress levels.
- **Customizable Environment:** You can tailor your workspace with plants or decor that enhances your mood and comfort.
- **Time for Exercise:** Without the constraints of office hours, there's more opportunity for physical health—consider a daily walk or workout.

Taking control of your environment and incorporating healthy habits can lead to better overall well-being.

### Networking Opportunities

Remote work doesn't mean you have to sacrifice professional connections. Many companies promote virtual networking through online platforms and forums. You can connect with colleagues and industry professionals from diverse backgrounds. This exposure can enhance your skills and broaden your perspectives while building valuable connections.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/online-jobs-hiring-now  
  
The benefits of remote work are undeniable and growing rapidly. With the rise of online jobs, it’s important for individuals to explore these options to enhance their professional lives. If you're seeking more flexibility, cost savings, and overall well-being, pursuing a remote position could be the right path for you.

### Conclusion

Securing an online job hiring now can be an excellent way to gain flexibility and financial independence. By implementing effective strategies for quick employment, such as utilizing job boards, network connections, and enhancing your resume, you can significantly increase your chances of landing that ideal remote position. As we continue to navigate a rapidly changing work environment, knowing where to look and how to present yourself becomes even more crucial.

The benefits of remote work are not just enticing; they’re transforming the way people view their careers. The freedom to work from anywhere, create your own schedule, and eliminate commute times are just a few reasons why online jobs are becoming increasingly sought after. This shift in the job landscape is allowing employees to better balance their professional and personal lives, leading to higher job satisfaction.

We read them together, the words floated into the air

Like embers floating up out of a fire into a night so cold

The blood on your arms ran onto my cold hands

The tears from my eyes dripped into your lap

We held on until we drifted away into sleep

Just like the stars, always facing but ever far

That night that I told you, I made it plain what I felt

You said “I’m sorry,” and I understood

But even now you still want my hands, the blood still flows

And we continue to dance the dance of binaries

Need advice.","TL;DR: Been married nearly a decade. My spouse has had multiple emotional and physical affairs, has been regularly verbally abusive and few times physically, and is terrifyingly unpredictable. I stayed for the kids, but I’m at my breaking point. Seeking advice on custody and how to handle the divorce while protecting myself and my children.

I apologize if this sounds like rage bait, but this has been my life for years, and I’m at the edge of what I can handle. I’ve changed some details for anonymity, but the core remains the same.

Married for almost nine years. A couple of years in, during the stress of early parenthood, I discovered my spouse was having an emotional affair. It came to light when I got a text (sent by her) clearly meant for someone else—""I love you, but keep it clean -  \[husband/me\] is next to me.” She admitted it, blaming it on feeling neglected while I worked demanding hours. She promised it was over. I believed her.

Fast forward seven years. We have another child, and shortly after, she tells me she hates me and wants a separation. I reluctantly agree, making her promise not to bring anyone into our home or see the person I suspected from years before. Six months later, I catch that very person leaving our house at 5 a.m. on the doorbell cam while I was on a trip with our son. She claimed he “just dropped by with coffee.”

It spiraled from there. She physically assaulted me during an argument and was arrested for domestic violence. Shortly after, she revealed she was pregnant with the other man’s child. She claimed it was a one-time drunken mistake, despite my explicit request not to see him. She terminated the pregnancy, claiming it was for the sake of our family, and begged to reconcile. Against my better judgment, I agreed for the sake of the kids.

Weeks later, I caught her making out with another man in our kitchen—our toddler present the whole time. She said she “wasn’t ready” to reconcile. This man was a coworker, also married with children. The affair caused gossip at work, so she ended it, but not before destroying any trust I had left.

Early this year, she claimed she wanted to repair our marriage for good. Weeks later, I saw texts with yet another man, describing how much she wanted him. She insisted it was “before we reconciled,” but recently I checked phone records and while the texts I saw were from before we were allegedly exclusive - I think she was just starting something new. The bills showed months of messages (300-400 a month) between them AFTER we reconciled.

The final straw came a few weeks ago when I discovered she was having yet another affair with a different coworker. She used my short business trips to meet him in hotels, lying about where she was. On the anniversary of our honeymoon, while leaving a hotel with him, she texted me photos of us from that trip saying ""remember when we were at this ... place"".

In public, she plays the role of the perfect wife—affectionate and charming. Privately, she’s cold, strict, and terrifying. My therapist suspects borderline personality disorder, though I don’t know if that excuses her behavior. I’m finally speaking with lawyers and planning my exit, but I’m scared. If her infidelity or abuse comes out, she might lash out violently.

I’m a successful professional and a devoted father. I’ve stayed in this nightmare for the kids, but I know I need to leave. My questions:

Do I push for primary custody, knowing she might fight dirty?

Do I keep her transgressions private to avoid escalation, or use them as leverage for a swift divorce?

How do I protect my kids from the fallout of this mess?

Do I tell the other parties' significant others that they're being unfaithful? I would want to know. But I don't know if it's my place to do so.

I’m exhausted. I’ve been covertly planning an exit to protect myself and my children, but I hate feeling like I’m being deceptive. I just want peace.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I'm talking to lawyers now. As I've pretended to not know about her ongoing affair, I've been a bit distant at home, and she's been extraordinarily sweet - which makes the part to actually state I want a divorce even more of a challenge.",6,1734029426.0,Advice,16,1.0,False

Had 4 close calls:
Day 3 out of 6: Trekked through a blizzard in Pleasant Valley, got lost, and nearly died from the cold. Found and slept in a bear cave because I didn't have the health to find anything else. I should have slept in one of the farm buildings but wanted to rush to twm as fast as possible in case I ran out of time.

Day 4 out of 6: Wth it's so cold in twm where even indoors I was slowly freezing. Decided to trek as far as possible and sleep next to a campfire outdoors. My health was half from the blizzard yesterday so any wolf struggle could kill me. Slept on a boulder next to a log and 2 crates that I couldn't open without a saw. Timberwolves pack of FIVE noticed me leaving the boulder so I walked to the rope with a flare out. Learned that walking too close to wolves will still result in then bitig you even if they're cowering from the flare. I'm definitely going to die if I wolf struggle. 
I use a stim and climb ropes I had no business climbing and got away from the wolves.
When I got to the cave that takes you to the summit, I slept until I filled Fatigue and health was half. I climbed the last rope and there was a lone black/normal wolf that pounced me not far from the cave. I survived the struggle and killed the wolf with a knife but I'm back down to 1/4 health. I might freeze to death before I limp to the plane.

Day 5:
I slept, ate, cooked and looted my way to best clothing in the plane including 2 expedition parkas, 2 snow pants, and 1 green baklava, and repaired the rifle to >50 condition so it won't jam, and brewed all the coffee so I don't have to rest.
Goated down the summit with an inventory full of food, water, medicine, flares, and rifle and landed in sight of a bear. It roared and I ran for the climbing rope. I didn't make it to the rope and got mauled.
I roped down and made a fire and repaired clothes through the night

Day 6:
I'm out of time and fire fuel so I need to reach the lighthouse from twm mountaineers hut in just 1 and a half day maybe. Sprinted and used up all the coffee to get from mountaineers hut, down south along the river in pleasant valley, and followed the road in coastal highway and couldn't find the lighthouse on the map, realized it's still 2 maps away! Used 5 emergency energy stims back to back and sprinted nonestop from coastal highway to the desolation point in just 3 hours (I'm surprised, never used a stim before). When getting onto the road close to the lighthouse, I could outrun the wolf that spotted me (I had my last flare out just in case) and get indoors. By the time I fired the distress pistol I had 2 hours only remaining.

Close as fuxk... I nearly lost the challenge so many times. That was really exhilarating! Having a lot of fun with the long dark.",1,1734029409.0,thelongdark,0,1.0,False
1hcs6me,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hcs6me/aitah_for_being_friends_with_my_sons_guitar/,AITAH for being friends with my son’s guitar teachers?,"Hey, just experienced something and I’m just trying to get your opinion. Bear with me though, it's a bit of a long story. 

When I first moved back to my hometown (6mos ago), I was looking for a guitar teacher for my son (10 yo). My brother gave me a phone number of a lady (let's call her the ""M"") from his church who owns a “music school”.

I called M and tried to get a meeting to understand her programs. We met at a coffee shop. My first impression was a bit negative due to the following: (i)she refused to meet us at her “studio”; and (ii) when she explained her programs it has a bit of cult vibe (she wants psychological assessment before the lessons began and she requires reassessment every 3 months). She told me that following her programs strictly is imperative to ensure that my kid has fulfilling musical career (she used to be the vocal coach of our country’s version of American Idols). 

I’m being very clear from the first meeting that I’m not interested with her full program, and my only goal is helping my son enjoys music in the hope of finding him additional creative outlet (he already sketches). She told me that the program could be tailored as per my request, she has a guitar teacher that fits my need, and the monthly cost will be ~USD150 for 1 hour session/week + ~USD25 for transportation fee if the teacher comes to my house. As the standard rate for guitar teacher is ~USD30/hour, I took her offer for private lessons in my house. However, I want the first lesson to be at her “studio”, as I want my son to see studio set up and I want to see how legit M is. I had a bad feeling but my mindset at that time was, I'm going to end it if the lesson sucks. 

When I took my son for his first lesson, my bad feelings were confirmed. Her “studio” is actually her living room, it is tight, cramped, messy, her three dogs were running around and barking non stop. There’s not a single amp or cable available for my son to use, no instruments available other than a keyboard, an acoustic guitar, and couple of microphones. 

But, we loved the guitar teacher (let's call him ""J""). He’s a very talented working musician around my age and plays in several cover bands. He’s very cheerful and my son immediately felt comfortable with him. I was thinking to myself that since the lessons would be at my house, I wouldn't need to deal with M and her dodginess. 

After the session I chatted with J, and as I used to be in an “almost successful” originals band, we immediately clicked from our shared experience of being  f’ed by the industry. M also joined our discussion and stated something along the line that J is so talented but at the same time, naive. M then went on to say, she considers herself as J's big sis and want to protect J from being exploited. She seemed sincere at that time, and J seemed very trusting of her. 

Before I went home, M insisted to me that all communication must go through her, and I shouldn't contact J directly. That was weird, but maybe M is just one of those insane artists. 

So the next lessons were happening in my house. Usually after my son’s lesson ended, I would jam and drink with J until late at night. After 2 lessons J need to travel for family emergency, but he introduced T as a replacement teacher to us. I immediately vibed with T. He's a well-known guitarist and producer in the town's underground scene. I hanged out a lot with T, and watched his band performances, he even gave me backstage access in his shows. 

When J returned, I noticed that his behavior changed. He's always irritated by me whenever we talked. At that time, I thought it was because there's a competitiveness with T. I don't really think of it at that time, and proceeded as usual

On the third month, M came to my house during my son's lesson and told me she wanted my son to perform. She said that it was part of the program and it's important for my son's development. I sought clarity on the kind of stage she prepared for the performance (i.e. what type of venue, what type of audience, who else performing). Her answer was not clear, other than the performers are her students. I clearly told her that I can't commit, as I'm concerned if my son is performing outside of safe environment.  I don't want his confidence crushed and lost his newfound love for music. 

When we arrived at the event it was a sh*tshow. After asking around I gathered, that M was actually crashing a private gathering organized by her friend, and her only student is my son who supposed to be playing when the band (a professional one) is taking a break. I don't spend another minute and left immediately. 

The week after, M showed up at my house, telling me that J is unavailable for the next lesson and she's looking for replacement. On the day scheduled for my son's lesson, no one showed up. But then J texted me, telling me that though I should've heard from M, he wanted to tell me himself that he's quitting (which is completely different from the impression M gave that J's only unavailable for one lesson. 

Around the same time, T also contacted me asking how much I actually paid for my son's lessons. I told him the number as a friend, and he told me that J was only paid ~USD60/month. I immediately realized, J's change of behavior on the second month. I immediately called J to straighten things up. In my call, J confirmed some of my bad feelings about M: (i) there's never a music school; and (ii) M told J he only got ~USD60 because I refused to pay more. J even told me that he's only paid for the first month and never received any more payments, that's why he quit M.

After knowing this, I met M to told her my son would stop taking lessons from her school, so no need to find a replacement teacher. I only asked her to gave J the money owed. She was furious with me, she told me I have no ethics because I have relationships with the teachers without involving her. In particular she's very upset for the following: (i) I'm helping T with the enterprising side of his band without giving her a cut; (ii) T is producing for my band and booking us gigs without involving her (my son started playing music reignited my passion, and not long after I joined an originals band); and (iii) I gave J projects (jingle writing) without involving her (I knew J is financially struggling). I let her fume and didn't bother to argue since that would be that last time I interacted with her anyway. 

But then a month after it went down, my mom started asking me what I did to M. Apparently, she started to talk to people at the church that I ruined her, I'm poaching her teachers, and now she has no more business for her ""school"". She told everyone that it all went to sh*t because I speak with the teachers behind her back. 

Now I'm questioning myself, do I breach any ethics by having personal relationships with the teachers?

She's always been creative, and, unsurprisingly to me, it turns out that she's got an incredible talent for island design. Even so, she sometimes gets stuck trying to figure out how to handle certain builds. So for Christmas this year, I wanted to get her something that might help inspire her when she's in a creative rut (or just needs some ideas). That's where I need suggestions.

For any experiences island designers out there, would you be able to point me towards any books/resources that have been useful to you, as a source of inspiration for your island builds?

It doesn't have to be _specifically_ about Animal Crossing (although I'm certainly open to that), but I was thinking in terms of maybe one of those coffee table reference guides that have lots of pictures and diagrams; maybe one that shows off different architectural styles from across history and culture... or ideas for interior decorating, or color theory, or descriptions of various 'aesthetics' and the attributes and accessories that are associated with them, etc.

Hopefully you know what I'm talking about, but really, I'd be happy with _any_ suggestions you might have, as long as it's something that has helped you find creative inspiration for your island builds.

* Is 50/50 and consumed with what he considers to be fairness

>Over the last decade, a cloud has formed over the green and pleasant pastures of puzzle gaming. Acrid-smelling and oily-black, it billows across the horizon from an entirely different genre. Follow the plume to its source, and you’d be greeted by a shocking sight – an endless, whirring mass of mining drills and iron smelters, assembly machines and steam engines, all linked by a spaghetti-like network of conveyor belts. Those intrepid enough to visit this place rarely return, and its infernal sprawl creeps closer and closer to your door every day.

>I’m referring, of course, to factory-building games, which task players with constructing an interconnected, ever-expanding web of production lines in pursuit of some lofty goal. An offshoot of the management sim genre, what separates these games from the likes of *Planet Coaster* and *Two Point Hospital* is their hard logical core. Instead of managing people, you oversee a complex system of machines, building it and priming it to be as efficient as possible. This also makes them uniquely challenging puzzle games, able to sternly test the logical part of your brain in a manner far more open-ended than most puzzlers. 

>Although the genre has been around for a while, 2024 has been a particularly notable year for factory-builders. In September, Coffee Stain Studios released the final version of [*Satisfactory*](https://www.satisfactorygame.com/) onto PC, garnering rave reviews. A month later, Wube Software released its long-anticipated expansion to [*Factorio*](https://www.factorio.com/) – Space Age, a vast and transformative addition to the original factory-building experience. 

>Both titles are among the highest-rated games of the year, praised for their scope, depth, challenge and ambition. In this article, I’ll explain precisely what makes these games such compelling conundrum generators, what distinguishes these more recent entries to the genre, and where to get started if you’re thinking of opening a factory of your own.

What do you think about this article?

in terms of raw scale, are probably the most ambitious puzzle games that you can buy today.

Personally I'm kind of skeptical of the idea that that Factorio should be called a puzzle game. Yes it takes a lot of thought over a lot of time to build a factory. I've enjoyed playing Factorio. But I think the puzzle game genre label is more useful if it tells people this is a specific type of game that you can get a specific type of experience from. Management/strategy/city-builders are different genres that gives a different type of experience than the puzzle games that are most often recommended here. If the puzzle game label expands to include every video game that requires some thought about what to do to overcome obstacles, then that could include most video games, and the label becomes meaningless.",3,1734028797.0,puzzlevideogames,0,1.0,False

This turned out pretty long, so you have a TLDR at the end.
I have been together with my GF for 9 months, we moved in together 2 months ago 

Since moving in with her, we both work separately. She keeps telling about men asking her out. Recently told me about having a long talk with a guy on the bus who invited her to a coffee shop. She accepted, but told him she has a boyfriend, at which point he said he's sorry and took back the invitation.

The most concerning thing, though, is that yesterday she met a new guy at work. He invited her and 2 other girls to do another shift at a different place after this one is done. She sent me a message saying that she'll do another shift with a group of people she met and will only come back home tomorrow at 7 am. So when they finished this shift, he gave the 2 people who were with them a ride home and offered my GF to come to his house since she lives in another city, which she accepted. She told me he called his mother and told her, ""I'm bringing a girl over. No, not like that."" And he has a gym near his house, so after they went to his house and he got something from there they just worked out together. After that, they picked up the two other girls and drove to do a night shift somewhere in that town. After the shift, she returned home with public transit.

I think that accepting coffee dates with guys she just met is not okay while in a relationship. And that going to a strangers house, the day she met him, is not okay. Not only is that not respectful in a relationship to go to a man's house when you just met him and he decided to invite you, it's also extremely dangerous because you don't know his intention.

1hcrnhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/girlscouts/comments/1hcrnhw/hot_question_night_lights/,Hot question:  night lights,"One of the Girl Scout properties my troop rents each year is an open floor space sort of deal with mats on the floor.  I have a DBJC troop and the thing they struggle with the most in a shared sleeping space (other than being quiet enough to actually go to sleep) is whether or not to have a night lights and how bright should said night light be.  Left to their own devices, then pro-night lighters will use flashlights which turns into flashlight wars and there isn’t enough coffee in the world for me to want to deal with that.

Things I have tried with limited success:  
1. Allowing the oldest girls (who are the most insistent on sleeping in absolute darkness) to stay up later in the hopes that the little girls fall asleep.  Spoiler alert: the little girls do not fall asleep.

2. Having some sort of dim, diffuse light (I actually have these pop lights with a blue light filter and they project stars on the ceiling) and then using glow sticks to mark things like the pathway to the bathroom.  It’s not bright enough for the Pro-Night Light crowd and I think it may actually have wound them up.

3. Giving them individual lights to hide inside their sleeping bags.  This probably has the best potential, but the struggle is to find something bright enough without being too bright.

4. Dividing the room into people who want night lights and people who don’t so that the pro night light crowd can be closest to the light source.  As much as they feel strongly about the night lights situation, they feel even more strongly about the “sleeping next to my sister/cousin/buddy” situation.

1hcrltd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TryingForABaby/comments/1hcrltd/sperm_analysis_from_fail_to_normal_in_3_months/,"Sperm Analysis: from FAIL to NORMAL in 3 months
","(To Mods: Edited) At the very beginning of our IVF journey early last year, my husband (39 years old at the time) did a sperm analysis for the first time.  We were completely shocked at his results: nearly a ***FAIL*** on every single category (morphology, motility, count, volume, etc).

# Back then (early Spring 2023):

His **lifestyle**: no smoking cigarettes, drinking maybe 4 beers a week, two to three cups of coffee/day, taking a marijuana edible 3x per week, no rigorous exercising but would go on long walks almost daily.  
His **health**: pretty average 'modestly healthy' guy, very slender physique, would try to eat some vegetables every day, would occasionally share dessert with me weekly.  
His **mental health**: really, REALLY bad.  His immediate family member passed away several months prior and it completely wrecked him.  He also quit a nightmare job situation but had trauma/nightmares for many months afterwards.

After a very poor 1st IVF treatment cycle, our doctor recommended we take two/three months off in an attempt to improve both our health profiles before the next egg retrieval.  She recommended some supplements/vitamins, and increasing our exercising.  The recommendations were the same for both of us, with the exception of adding zinc to his supplements.

**Here are the DAILY changes we incorporated** (""Ours"" to signify changes we made from our own research)

1. Vitamin D
2. Astaxanthin
3. Fish oil
4. Zinc  (just him, not me)
5. Coq10 / Ubiquinol
6. Folate
7. Melatonin  (turns out melatonin is an antioxidant!)
8. Choline/Inositol (ours)
9. Increase intake of vegetables
10. Shilajit  (can be purchased easily on Amazon. You can google the research on sperm trials.) (ours)
11. Ashwagandha  (easy to find on Amazon) (ours)
12. Cutting caffeine to one or two cups daily (this kind of broke him, LOL) (ours) N/A for me as I don't drink caffeine anyway.
13. Cutting alcohol to one beer a week, but sometimes none. (ours)  On a single occasion he got drunk, LOL. N/A for me, I don't drink.
14. Cutting marijuana (ours). He scaled down to 1x/month. I myself used 2x/month (many months none at all), but I stopped altogether early last year
15. Exercising slightly more, by bicycling
16. Stress: Unfortunately, the IVF journey, and even the waiting periods between cycles, are highly stressful. We weren't able to maintain any ""zen"" lifestyles, whatsoever.  Life is stressful.

# Three Months Later

Three months later, we went back to the clinic, where we did another (and ultimately many more) round of egg retrieval and IVF.  **This time, his sperm was NORMAL on nearly every single category.**  Only one other category was borderline normal, but I forget which.

Sadly, my egg quality never really changed (I learned from another famous IVF doctor that there's currently *no scientifically guaranteed* way to improve egg quality, unlike sperm), but it was very nice to see improvement for him on all categories. Side note: I myself am a lifelong non-smoker, non-drinker, but this post is not about me.

He kept most of the lifestyle up for the following months, froze 4 vials of sperm, and gradually, after multiple failed cycles due to poor egg quality, we eased back on his restrictions. He drinks at most 3 beers a week, drinks 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day. He struggles to function without coffee. He consumes a little bit of THC weekly, sometimes 2x a week. The supplements are still the same to this day.

The last time we tested his sperm a few months ago, it was still a **NORMAL** on nearly every single category.

\------> Hope this helps any interested couple out there!  Any other changes you made I didn't mention?",14,1734027841.0,TryingForABaby,3,0.82,False
1hcrkzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1hcrkzq/tempus_fugit/,Tempus Fugit,"**Chapter 1**

“Do you want regular fries or seasoned,” the girl behind the register asks. She was younger than the man ordering, possibly still in high school, but her eyes were dead. They were a brilliant green color but there was no sparkle behind them, like all hope and life had been drained out of her and her long blond hair was pulled back into a ponytail and over the back of her visor.

“Seasoned,” Jake Marshall replies. At only five feet seven inches tall, Jake sometimes felt he was the most average person on the planet. He had average brown hair; average brown eyes and he even felt that he had average looks. Plenty of people, guys and girls both, had told him how cute he was but if he was really as cute as they said, he’d be getting laid much more often, or so he felt. He’d been losing his hair slowly since he was seventeen and now at twenty-five it was really starting to show, something he was *not* happy about. He also wasn’t happy with his weight anymore, not that he’d ever been too happy about it. He’d been average in that too for a long time, but ever since he got out of the Army and took this security job, he’d been steadily gaining weight. Most days, he did his best to ignore it.

After his food arrived, he went back to his post in the lobby of the office building next door. As the only security guard on duty, he technically wasn’t supposed to leave the building, but it was cheaper to buy his lunch for the days he worked than to buy what he needed to bring it. He knew he needed either more hours or another job, but the economy was crap, and he felt lucky to find the one job he had and his status as a veteran didn’t seem to count anywhere near as much as people said it should.

*Veteran status. Yeah. Right.* He thought to himself with a sniff. All he’d done was join the Army during a time of war and his reasons for joining hadn’t been anything special. He’d wanted to take some time off from school after graduating from high school and his mom had told him he needed to find a job if he was going to do that. He’d quit after six months and one too many slights. Unfortunately, he’d chosen the wrong moment to quit as he and his mom were getting evicted from their apartment. He managed to stay with his best friend for a week but in the end, the choice had been either live on the streets or join the military. He’d done the whole live on the street thing before as a kid and seeing as he wasn’t anxious to repeat the experience, he joined the Army since it was the only branch he didn’t have a bullshit excuse for. If he joined the Air Force he’d want to be a pilot, but he was terrified of heights and didn’t think the two would mesh well. He’d read *way* too much about the Titanic, so the Navy was out and the Marines were just plain insane, hot as fuck but completely nuts (the fact that he didn’t think he’d survive even one day of their PT regimen was neither here nor there). The Space Force (and what a ridiculous name that was) hadn’t been a thing yet and he hadn’t even considered the Coast Guard, but then, did anyone really consider them? That just left the Army. Fortunately, as a retired veteran himself, his best friend’s grandfather allowed him to stay for the two weeks it took the Army to process his paperwork. The Iraq War was in full swing then and they were eager for people, especially those with few options.

He’d signed up for a five-year contract but most of his friends didn’t think he’d last more than a week. He’d beaten them all in the end though. He’d lasted just over a year and a half before depression set in and he ended up with a medical discharge. Sometimes, usually when he had too much time to think, he felt a pang of regret for what had happened. He missed the comradery of the military, that feeling of knowing that everyone who wears the uniform would die for each other, like they were all one big dysfunctional family. As opposed to always wondering who was going to stick a knife in your back among civilians. It only goes to show how strange life could be, considering how much he had hated the military while he was in high school.

He desperately wanted to go to college and become an archaeologist, but every time he‘d tried, he’d been met with blank looks. No one seemed to care about his dreams because they thought it was useless or because they thought you couldn’t make any money doing it, which said a lot about the world in Jake’s mind. Also, no one seemed to be able to tell him what major he needed to take to get into the field and Google searches turned up a lot of information about archaeology itself, but not what major to take, even when he typed the question outright. Maybe he just didn’t know how to use Google or maybe the universe was against him. It didn’t matter in the end though. He was determined to follow his dream come hell, or high water.

The day ended uneventfully four hours later, and he went home to his closet of an apartment. If he was being honest, the place was a dump and he was pretty sure someone would have to spend some serious money upgrading it so that it was good enough to be condemned, but at least it was his. He changed into a pair of shorts and a t-shirt, grabbed a snack, plopped down on the couch, and turned on the TV. He went to bed around midnight and lay there for at least half an hour before finally drifting off to sleep.

When he woke up eight hours later, his first thought was that he was still dreaming. As the fog of sleep cleared though, he realized that somehow, he has awakened somewhere else. The bed is far softer than what he is used to and the soft blue glow coming from the tops of the walls says the room is larger by far than his own, almost as big as his living room. He climbs out of bed slowly and looks around for a light switch. He curses silently when it’s not readily visible.

“How does one hit the damned lights in thi…” he whispers only to break off as a pair of lights in the ceiling slowly brighten.

As he guessed, the room was about the size of his own living room. The walls and ceiling were a plain white and the carpet on the floor was a dark blue. There were only two doors to the room, one of them opposite the bed and the other halfway along the adjoining wall to the right of the bed. A framed copy of Van Gogh’s *Starry Night* hangs on the wall opposite the bed along with movie posters from various *Star Trek* movies. Above the bed, hanging like a tapestry between two covered windows is a black U.S. Army flag. Other than the bed and a couple of beside tables, there is no other furniture in the room, but to the left of the bed is an open door leading to a closet with clothes on hangars and beside that is a set of drawers set into the wall. Jake looks around for a minute in surprise and then is struck by an idea.

“Lights,” he says clearly, and the lights dim again until the only illumination is the soft blue glow.

“Lights,” he says again, and the lights brighten again. He slowly climbs out of bed and heads for the door on the right and it slides open with a soft *hiss* as he approaches. He quickly slams his back to the wall beside the door. “Really wish I owned a gun right about now,” Jake whispers to himself as he quickly peeks around the door.

He sticks his head out again and then steps slowly out into the next room, ready to dive for cover if the need arises, but no one pops out to take a shot at him. The room is furnished with a couple of couches, a few chairs, two glass coffee tables and a desk with its own chair set beside the only other door into the room. On the desk sits a small computer. An official U.S. Army flag, as well as a U.S. Air Force flag adorn opposite walls while the wall without windows is decorated with posters of various images of space, including a fantastic image of the Horsehead Nebula.

As Jake steps into the middle of the room, a noise stops him dead in his tracks. The noise sounded exactly like the door chime from *Star Trek* and Jake looks at the door in confusion. Kidnappers, or anyone else who meant him harm for that matter, would just walk right in and not bother with the niceties. Plus, he wasn’t in his own apartment so if they *were* kidnappers, they’d already succeeded in kidnapping him. The chime sounds again, and Jake can’t help but smile to himself despite being very confused.

“Fine,” Jake whispers to himself. “Let’s see how this plays out.” He straightens up and tries to look as dignified as possible in just a shirt and shorts. “Enter,” he calls out clearly when the chime sounds a third time.

The door slides open to reveal a well-built man who is only about an inch or two taller than Jake. He has curly blond hair that reaches to just below his ears and his eyes are somewhere between blue and grey, which matches the color of his shoulders and undershirt of the uniform he wears. The man has a strong jawline, and his nose is long and straight. His uniform is mostly black except for the shoulders of his jacket and the undershirt peeking out underneath it. A belt wraps around his waist and his boots are black as well. He has a bit of a commanding presence, but he stands deferentially towards Jake. On the whole, Jake isn’t struck dumb by the man’s beauty but he wouldn’t kick him out of bed for eating crackers.

“Good morning sir,” he says with a nod to Jake. “I trust you slept well.”

“Just fine, thank you,” Jake says in surprise. The man’s voice is pleasant and deep and he spoke with confidence. It made Jake want to trust him, which immediately made him suspicious.

“Don’t take this the wrong way but…who are you,” Jake asked.

The man smiles, revealing perfect white teeth and says, “My name is Alex.”

“Alex? Huh.”

“Yes. As in Alexander the Great.”

Jake cocks an eyebrow. “That seems a bit presumptuous.”

“Maybe, but I didn’t choose it. And, if you’ll forgive a bit of arrogance, I think it suits me.”

Jake shrugs, “If you like it, that’s all that matters. Now, if we can dispense with the…pleasantries, just where the *fuck* am I?”

“Of course, sir. You are aboard the *U.S.S. Alexander* which is currently in a high Earth orbit of approximately 36,000 kilometers or 22,369 miles.”

Jake realizes that his mouth is hanging open and he quickly closes it. “You’re kidding right? This is some kind of joke?”

Alex smiles and gestures to the windows behind Jake, who turns to see the shutters over the windows retract and reveal the soft blue glow of Earth slowly spinning in space. Jake’s mouth drops open again in awe, pictures just did not do the view justice. Jake slowly moves towards the windows as he closes his mouth, still transfixed by the view.

“Beautiful,” Jake breathes.

“Sir?” Alex asks after a moment. “I have a message for you to see that will explain everything.”

“Breakfast?”

“I can have something waiting for you if you like.”

“Ok. Just let me grab a shower first.”

“Yes sir. There are extra clothes for you in the dresser area, sir as well as uniforms in the closet.”

“Thanks.”

“Of course, sir.”

Jake goes back into the bedroom and through the other door which turns out to lead into a bathroom. He grabs a quick shower and then heads back into the bedroom where he considers putting on one of the uniforms from the closet, but he thinks it might constitute a contract of some kind so instead he grabs some fresh clothes from the drawers. He does grab a pair of black combat boots though before going back into the main room where Alex is still waiting.

“This way please sir,” Alex says nodding to him.

Jake follows him out the door and into a long and familiar-looking corridor.

“Suddenly I feel like I’m on the set of *Star Trek: Voyager*,” Jake mumbles to himself. “Only with a brighter paint job.”

“Considering the designer,” Alex replies with a slight smile. “I think you’ll find a lot of elements from those shows here.”

“Oh?”

Alex only smiles and leads him to a set of doors that open to reveal a small room.

“Let me guess,” Jake says. “A turbolift.”

“Naturally sir. Bridge.”

The doors shut and if it wasn’t for the lights flashing past, Jake wouldn’t know they were moving. The trip was short and when the doors open again Jake steps out onto the ship’s bridge.

“Wow,” he says looking around him. “It looks like *Voyager’s* bridge.”

“A few changes had to be made, mostly for safety reasons.”

“I see. The paint job’s different too.”

“The designer felt that too much grey would just depress everyone.”

“I can understand that.”

Alex leads Jake around the railing behind the three chairs in the center of the bridge and the two of them stand there for a moment while Jake looks hungrily at the center seat before sitting in it.

“How’s it feel sir,” Alex asks smiling slightly.

“*Very* nice,” Jake replies grinning like an idiot. “I always wanted to captain a starship on a grand adventure into the unknown of deep space.”

“Sorry to disrupt the mood sir,” Alex says after a moment. “But I believe you wanted some answers.”

“Right,” Jake says getting up. “Lead the way.”

Alex leads Jake over to another door and into a conference room just off the bridge. The lights come up as they enter, revealing a long and highly polished wooden table running the length of the room, surrounded by comfortable-looking chairs. One whole wall is taken up by a series of large windows, the metal shutters sliding up as they enter. On the wall opposite the windows is a large computer screen, currently switched off. Jake takes a seat at the head of the table, where a plate of bacon, eggs, and pancakes already buttered and drenched in syrup is waiting. Alex stands at parade rest on his right side.

“Alright,” Jake says settling into his chair and picking up the fork beside the plate. “About those answers…”

Before Jake can finish, a hologram appears in front of the computer screen set into the wall. The hologram is of Jake himself, but he appears older by at least a decade and his left eye has been replaced by a cybernetic implant. The metal of the implant appears to be gold colored and the center glows a bright, cheerful red. He wears a uniform similar to the one Alex wears except that where his is grey, the older version of Jake wears a jacket with deep red shoulders and three gold stars adorn either side of his collar.

“Hello Jake,” the hologram of Older Jake says somewhat cheerfully. “If you’re watching this, then everything went well, and I know you’ll do what’s necessary to protect those we love. Once a soldier, always a soldier. If someone else is watching this and you’re human, then I pray that you’ll take this seriously and do what needs to be done to protect us all. If you’re Restatti, then I hope you burn in Hell.”

 Older Jake bows his head for a moment before looking up again and continuing. “I know you have a lot of questions Jake, I certainly would if I were you.” Older Jake smiles. “Sorry. Couldn’t resist. I hope you’re comfortable because this is going to be a long story.”

“If you’re watching this when you should be, then things should be going all right, but I’m sorry to say that your life is about to take a turn for the worse. Your job is going to move to in-house security, and you’ll be reduced to working on the weekends only. Obviously, this means you won’t be able to keep your apartment…or much else for that matter. *I* moved back home to PA and got back into school. Actually, got my bachelor’s in History, Anthropology, and Sociology. By the way, archaeology is one of the four sub-fields of anthropology, at least in the US, so when you’re ready, start off with a major in anthropology. Actually, if you go the same route I took and major in all three, it looks better for grad schools...and it’s not as difficult as it sounds.”

Older Jake stops and looks thoughtful for a second. “You’ll probably be too busy for that, but it’s a thought. Anyway, after I graduated, I rejoined the military, the Air Force this time and eventually became an officer. Shortly afterwards, I volunteered for a special assignment, classified of course, that involved testing a device that was supposed to help us travel the stars. A stasis chamber if you can believe that.

“The experiment was only supposed to last a year. One year in stasis to check and see how well the chamber worked. Guess I should have known something would go wrong, Murphy’s Law and all that. Sometime during that year, an alien species known as the Restatti came to Earth and conquered it. They wiped out all resistance, destroyed our cities and enslaved what remained of humanity.

“I don’t know what else they were testing in that experiment, but they must have been testing some new power systems as well because I only woke up when they began to fail, and the emergency protocols kicked in…five hundred years later. By then the Restatti had been in control of Earth for so long that humanity had stopped resisting. They’d given up. That all changed when I woke up. I started a rebellion that I hope will eventually bring down the Restatti, and we will make them pay for what they’ve done.

“You’re probably wondering how. Well, the Restatti Empire had grown so big it spanned a good portion of the galaxy. They had also grown weak and decadent. Those in control of Earth, while among the worst of tyrants, were also the laziest. Humanity was given unprecedented access to Restatti technology and facilities. After I figured out what had happened, I was determined to see Earth free and while they had been beaten, they were still human and only needed a spark to galvanize them into action.”

Older Jake sighs and looks up at the ceiling for a moment before continuing. “It took a surprisingly short time to kick the Restatti off Earth. They didn’t care much about us. Just one planet among many. It gave us the time we needed to build up a large enough force to repel the fleet they sent to crush us. We defeated them easily enough and began to spread our rebellion to other worlds. As you can imagine, *that* got their attention. They sent a larger force, and we defeated it…barely. But that makes things sound better than they actually are. Weak and corrupt, the Resttati Empire is still huge and powerful. So far, they haven’t seen us as much of a threat but they’re coming around. In fact, they’re sending their biggest force yet to take Earth, including one of their last dreadnoughts stationed in the region. If I’m honest…I doubt we’re going to win this one.”

Older Jake pauses there for a minute and seems to consider. “There is a light in all this darkness though. We had information about an alien space station that seems to have been used for temporal research. The Restatti had been studying it for some time and were close to learning its secrets. We stole it from them a few hours ago and they’ve diverted a portion of their fleet to retake the station, including their dreadnought. I’ve sent most of my own fleet back to Earth, except for the the *Valiant*. And the *Alexander*, of course. Preparations are being made to send the *Alexander* back in time to you so that you can stop the Restatti dead in their tracks *before* they’ve conquered Earth. I’ve loaded the data-banks with all the information, blueprints, and everything else I can think of to help you. I hope it’s enough. I hope this works even more because our scientists aren’t sure what’s going to happen when we activate this station. Whatever happens though, I intend to destroy this station when the Restatti get here and hopefully take a few of their ships with it. Doubt we’ll get the dreadnought, but one can hope.

“I’m also getting a lot of flak for doing this in the first place. The *Alexander* is one of our first ships that can go toe-to-toe with a Restatti Dreadnought. Plenty of people are afraid to lose it, but the *Rameses* is just about complete so it’s not like we’re losing our only one.

“One more thing. We weren’t sure what would happen if we sent an organic being back in time, so we sent Alex, with his agreement of course. He’s an android and will be invaluable in helping you, whatever you decide. There are other AI’s aboard as well and the *Alexander* is one of our most advanced ships, so you should be well placed to do…whatever you decide. I hope you’ll do the right thing and protect Earth.

“Well,” Older Jake says with a sigh. “That’s it. Hopefully, I answered all of your questions but if not, I’m sure Alex will do the best he can. Good luck to you. See you in the mirror.”

The hologram of Older Jake smiles, snaps off a salute and then vanishes. Jake sits in his chair, his chin in one hand and a look of thoughtful contemplation on his face and his meal barely touched in front of him. After a full minute or more he turns to look Alex in the eye.

“So,” he says thoughtfully. “An android huh?”

“Yes sir,” he replies stiffly.

“Mmmm,” Jake says nodding. “Cool.”

They smile at each other for a moment before Alex says, “There is a more personal message for you sir.”

“There is?”

“Yes sir. Just a couple of things your older self wanted you to know.”

“Ok. Play it,” Jake says turning back to the screen.

The hologram of Older Jake reappears, and he smiles sadly. “Hello again Jake. There are a couple of things I couldn’t say in my first message that I thought you should know. First, and most importantly, Justin is going to die in a couple years if you don’t do anything.

Jake’s eyes widen and he takes in a sharp breath.

“He got into a car accident and wasn’t wearing a seat-belt. I know most of the time you’re probably ambivalent about him. We never did get on as kids. Always insisted on calling him my half-brother. When he died though…I felt pain like I haven’t felt before or since. He was my brother, and I loved him, no matter how much we got on each other’s nerves. Save him, for all our sakes. Alex has the exact details in his data-banks.”

Older Jake takes a moment to compose himself before continuing. “The doctor for the *Alexander* is an AI. I based him off the doctor from Voyager, but you may have already guessed that. See what he can do for mom, but for the love of God don’t let her get *any* cybernetic implants. She’s dangerous enough as it is, we don’t need her having any enhancements.”

Older Jake smiles knowingly at his younger self who gives a worried sort of chuckle at the thought.

“One last thing. The Restatti already have agents on Earth so try not to make any moves that would alert them before you’re ready, otherwise they might send a larger force than we have recorded, and everything will be lost. Sure, the technology I’m sending is more advanced but as a favorite author of ours once said, quantity has a quality all its own. Just be careful and I’m sure everything will work out. I’ve also included the coordinates for the alien station. Probably best if no one knows anything about it. Do what you will with it. Good luck.”

The hologram disappears again and Jake sucks in a noisy breath.

“Well, shit,” Jake says. “I probably should have led with that last bit. That’s going to make things difficult.”

“Yes sir,” Alex replies.

“Wait a minute,” Jake says sitting bolt upright a look of alarm on his face. “What’s the ship’s status? Can they see us down on Earth?”

“The ship is fully functional sir. The cloaking device is online and functioning well. No one can see us, either by the naked eye or with sensors.”

“Oh good,” Jake says breathing a sigh of relief and sitting back in his chair.

“Yes, sir.”

Jake sits there for a long time, apparently lost in thought.

“What are you thinking sir,” Alex asks.

“I’m thinking…” Jake says slowly staring up at the ceiling. “That I need to quit my job and move out of my apartment and move into those quarters I woke up in. If that’s alright?”

Alex smiles at that. “You always were different from everyone else sir.”

“Thank you. I don’t have to work at it and even if I did, it wouldn’t take much. Just out of curiosity, why do you say that?”

“Well, to begin with most people would simply see me as a machine to be ordered about. Somet*hing* made to make their lives easier. They don’t see synthetic life as equal to organic. Also, I feel I should point out that the ship is yours and if you want to stay aboard that’s your prerogative.”

“That last one I’ll buy,” Jake says turning to face Alex and looking him in the eye. “Now listen very closely, Alex because I will only say this once. If anyone, *ever* says anything to the effect that you are just a machine made to make the lives of organics easier, you let me know and I will personally toss their pathetic, cowardly, bigoted ass out the nearest airlock.”

“But sir, I *was* created…”

“Your origins are meaningless,” Jake says waving a hand, interrupting him. “The fact is that you are sentient. You know who and what you are. You can think and rationalize. In other words, you think, therefore you are. That’s a good enough definition of life for me. Which means, you are entitled to all the rights and privileges that everyone else has.”

“Thank you, sir. Have you decided what to do about the Restatti?”

Jake stands up and begins pacing around the conference room.

“The way I see it, I have three choices. Number one, I grab enough people, mostly friends to crew this ship, gather enough DNA samples to ensure that we can start the human race over and get as far away from here as possible.”

“A sound plan sir.”

“It’s a coward’s plan if I’m being honest.”

“If you say so, sir.”

“I do. Option two, I use this ship and its weaponry to conquer the planet and use its resources to build up a fleet large enough to take on the Restatti.”

“That’s a bold plan sir, and it does have several issues.”

“Not the least of which is that it too is a coward’s plan. That, and I *really* don’t want to become a dictator. Too much paperwork and everyone judges you over every little thing. What does it say about me that my first two plans are those of a coward?”

“What you think is irrelevant sir. It is what you do that matters.”

“Good thing my third plan is a little better then. Ok, option three. Quietly build a fleet of ships and gather enough people to crew them.

“If I may ask a question sir?”

“Go ahead.”

“Why not simply hand over this ship and its technology to the governments of Earth and let them deal with the situation? Quietly of course.”

Jake laughs at that. “Yeah right. To which one in particular? Give it to one of them and it would upset the balance of power on Earth. They’d fight the next ten world wars trying to figure out who was on top and the Restatti would just come in and walk all over us. No, if we’re going to save the planet we can’t rely on any government. Which means that whatever we do, we need to stay hidden from *everyone*.”

“That will prove difficult sir.”

“Extremely.”

Jake wolfs down the rest of his breakfast as he thinks.

“I need to see the doctor for a checkup. While I do that, Alex, can you locate Brayden Cook? He’s been my best friend since middle school and served in the Army as well. I think he lives in Washington state now, but I’m not sure where. He’s gotten a bit paranoid lately.”

“Searching,” Alex says, a faraway look coming over his face.

Bought for a great price that made this fairly low risk as a blind buy with potential to resell if needed. I've never tried Layton Exclusif, and I'm not a huge fan of standard Layton. Went with this because of solid reviews and the price, and I'm very impressed.

As with other recent French Avenue, the presentation is excellent which is always a good start. From the very first spray this just felt ready to go. Nothing cheap or synthetic, just a robust, well-blended and smooth scent which has true character. Yes it has the Layton DNA in there but everything here feels smoother, and the smokiness is far more comforting.

In Layton I find the apple and smoke almost reminiscent of sweet smoky bacon; an image which has basically put me off the scent somewhat. Here things are rounded, creamy and just right. Depth is added by the surrounding notes, and it just gives a real luxury feel. In particular the civet, oud, vanilla and coffee add richness, working in harmony with that Layton core.

Seriously recommend this, even if you aren't into Layton itself.",4,1734027705.0,fragranceclones,2,1.0,False

1hcrji4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hcrji4/how_to_sleep_less/,How to sleep less?,"Hi team, I’m averaging 12 hours of sleep most days currently, which is all well and good if I ignore my responsibilities, but I’m struggling to balance life this way. I find if I sleep at 10, I will sleep through all alarms and wake up at 10. It’s the same as going to sleep at 8, I would wake up around 8-9. Problem is, I just can’t get all I need done in only 12 hours. I’m struggling with understanding if I have taken on too much, or if I am simply wrestling with the needs of my body. 

I never used to be this way, I used to sleep at 10pm and wake at 7 am everyday, even on weekends. 

I’m not sure if this would be relevant but I’ve had a few hard knocks on the head in the past few years, I suffered a concussion 2 years ago through carbon monoxide poisoning and could only bring myself to be awake around 8 hours a day for a while after that. I feel since then I’ve not been able to get back on track with my sleep and I’m worried it’s become a priority in a dangerous way. I feel *exhausted*. 

I’ve tried many different variations of sleep improvement to ensure I get good sleep, and not just a lot of sleep. But I worry that my health may decline if I am perpetually pushing myself to stay awake to ensure I keep on top of things. I’m equally worried my life will fall apart if I don’t push myself to stay on top of things.

  
Am I being too kind on myself? Do I need to push through the exhaustion I might feel for a while before I can return to normal?

  
I feel so depleted most days that I am forgoing self-care to allow myself to go to bed earlier. Is this how it’s meant to be? I can only choose one? 

To be clear, I want to say I’m not emotionally exhausted. I mean my eyes are closing, my body is slowing and I’m out like a light. My partner has tried to wake me up, multiple times of a morning, but I never remember even becoming awake enough to bat him away for more shut eye. I’ve missed multiple alarms, multiple phones calls from family and my employer to wake up. I’ve always been a deep sleeper (something I used to be proud of) but I’m worried that I’m either being to easy on myself or that I am missing some… secret sauce to life. 

I drink coffee in the morning sometimes but usually tea and water throughout the day.

  
Someone, somewhere- please give me the secret sauce or the tough love I require to get myself back into the swing of things!

1hcrgvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1hcrgvl/where_to_go_from_om/,Where to go from OM ?,"Hi ! I (35f) worked for 6 years as an Office Manager ; Exec Assistant ; Admin Assistant, etc. in Canada and before that I worked in the show business for a few years (differents jobs such as artist driver, production etc.) in Europe. I have different Art and Art Management degrees.

I have a proposal to do an Office Relocation mission for 8 months (only handling the move of a company, instead of their OM doing it). I need to find an office, help negotiate it, than probably handle design, repairs, moving people and furniture. Then I could probably manage that new office.

My priorities have shifted as I’m a new mom, so being in office 5d/w and losing 10hs in the subway is less appealing but I guess I could get used to it (I didn’t mind before).

I’m mostly wondering where I can go « up »  from those jobs ? Head of admin ? Chief of staff ? Assets management ? Operations ? How to reach that ?

Not sure those jobs are my passion but I like meeting people, doing research, making deals and solving problems, things that you do everyday as an OM, but I feel like my « do whatever it takes » attitudes plays against me as people see me more as the fixing toilets and coffee machine person, while I saved the company a potential 2M$ in loss by proposing and implementing a policy while I was the only one doing HR...

Yonder is a lifestyle credit card which provides points to spend on ‘experiences’ such as restaurant meals, flights, hotels, coffee, beer at pubs, flowers, delivery food services, trips away (such as log cabins and Wellness retreats) and much more -**it changes every month**!

If you sign up via my referral link (here: [https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx](https://join.yondercard.com/bhdfbyx)) you will get 10,000 points (worth approximately **£50 in credit** towards various experiences, dependent on experience chosen, in cities of London, Manchester, Birmingham Bristol and Bath, or towards the **online experiences** such as flights - therefore can be used in any city, no matter where you live!).

Some good examples of redemptions I've personally used / I am planning on: 

* Fancy massage parlour 
* Various restaurants for lunches and dinner
* Ocean Bottle (akin to Chilly's) as a gift 
* Freddie's Flowers

On top of this, some other perks of the card and referral include:

* you will be able to claim 3 months *premium* membership for **free** which provides **worldwide family travel insurance** when booking travel on the card and also 5 points per £1 spent.
* From my rough calculations, this correlates to somewhere in the region of 2 to 3% cash back dependent on the experience
* You’ll also be able to get Mastercard foreign exchange fees (i.e essentially the best fees you can get when abroad, akin to cards like Chase/Monzo/Revolut) and purchase protection, which is a **huge perk** and means you can get 2-3% cash back on **holiday spends**!

To sign up, you can go through the referral link (or any referral link!) and follow the steps. They will run a soft credit check to determine if you’re eligible and then if so will run a hard check as with all credit cards to determine your credit allowance (but only after running the soft check to tell you if you meet their eligibility requirements).

You can also cancel before the 3 months premium ends to avoid the subscription renewing and once you’ve spent all the points on experiences, and switch to a free card or just cancel the card.

On the whole I’m really enjoying Yonder and hope you will too! I’m enjoying so much so that I’m I've continued using the subscription after my first 3 months premium free (and I also use it on top of my AMEX). The nice thing is it tends to be **accepted everywhere** that AMEX is not (because it's Mastercard) and you can spend abroad without a transaction fee.

1hcrfi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1hcrfi9/having_a_quiet_day_but_why/,"Having a Quiet Day, But Why?","Today, I’m having a quiet day—one of those rare occurrences where my tinnitus feels… bearable. Yesterday, though? It was awful—loud, intrusive, and downright maddening. Sure, I’m thankful to whichever Gods, stars, or sheer dumb luck granted me a break from the noise today, but I can’t help but wonder why?

Seriously, WTF? This is one of the most frustrating things about living with tinnitus—how unpredictable it is. Is today better because work hasn’t been as stressful? Because I actually slept well last night? Maybe my blood pressure or sodium intake is lower? It’s probably not caffeine—I’ve already had four cups of coffee today, so that’s clearly not the magic bullet. 

I just keep thinking... if I could understand what leads to these quieter days, maybe I could figure out how to have fewer of those loud, soul-draining days.

Does anyone else in r/tinnitus feel this way? Have you noticed any patterns or triggers that help you understand your quiet days? Would love to hear your thoughts.",3,1734027387.0,tinnitus,3,1.0,False

It even got the context of what's going on with me (grading) and used my description to make the selfie. (It got the age and length of my hair wrong, but not bad.)  I appreciate the results!

That said, is this a common occurrence for others? Does it have a special purpose? Also, can I use this as my avatar for this kin only? I kind of like the avatar that I use with my other kins. Thanks in advance!

1hcrd7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hcrd7c/to_the_guy_i_met_through_tinder/,To the guy I met through Tinder...,"I met you in April 2024 through Tinder. You super-liked me on March 18, and I was thrilled—you’re Korean, and I’ve always been fond of anything Korean. You messaged me shortly before I traveled to my hometown, asking where I usually play tennis. I didn’t respond right away because I was busy, and your question made me think you were only interested in tennis. I ignored it until March 24, when you sent another message. This time, I replied. You asked if I was up for a game, and we agreed to meet in mid-April when I returned to Manila. You mentioned you were a bad texter (so am I), so we didn’t keep in touch much before meeting.

Fast forward to April 16—we played tennis at VMMC. I picked you up at MRT Quezon Avenue station, and you were my first non-family passenger since I started driving in Manila. I was so nervous because you didn’t talk much, leaving me to carry most of the conversation. I also didn’t expect you to speak English so well—I thought communication might be a challenge. On the court, I played terribly because I hadn’t practiced in over a month and wasn’t used to hard courts. I was so embarrassed. Afterward, we went for lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant near your place, Feta. I liked how you took the lead in choosing the restaurant and ordering food—it was a relief since I’m bad at making food-related decisions.

During lunch, we talked about your nice condo, your ex-girlfriend who moved abroad, and your upcoming trip to Germany to celebrate your birthday with friends. I felt the date didn’t go well—the mismatch in tennis skills and the awkwardness during lunch left me intimidated. You paid for lunch, and I dropped you off at your condo. You gave me a side hug before leaving, which felt like a good sign. Still, I thought it was a one-time thing and that I wouldn’t hear from you again.

In June, I saw you at VMMC tennis courts, wearing the same purple shirt from our first meeting. I pretended not to recognize you. Then, on July 11, you messaged me, asking if I was playing in the weekend tournament. The conversation was brief but ended with you suggesting we play again sometime. On July 24, out of the blue, you messaged, “Hope you’re fine during this typhoon season. Depressing weather.” It was so random, but it made me happy. Still, I guarded my heart, not sure if you were really interested.

On August 5, you asked if I was playing in a tournament at CSA Bulacan on September 7. I initially said no—I was tired of doubles due to partner issues—but you encouraged me to try singles. I agreed, partly to spend the day with you. I figured you might need a ride since CSA is far, and we planned to go together.

September 7 marked our second meeting, five months after April. We ended up spending the entire day together because my games were in the morning and yours in the afternoon. I picked you up at 6 a.m., and we headed to the venue. Playing singles, a game I’m not confident in, was nerve-wracking because I wanted to impress you. Despite my poor performance, we grew closer that day, supporting each other throughout the tournament. You met some of my friends, which felt special. On the drive back, we talked a lot, thanks to the heavy traffic. We had dinner at Hyeongje Grill, a Korean BBQ place near your condo. For the first time, we sat next to each other—it felt like a boyfriend-girlfriend moment as we cut meat for each other. Before parting, you gave me another side hug. This time, it felt more meaningful because you returned to the car just to say goodbye. I knew there’d be a next time, but I didn’t want to rush it.

Our next meeting was at UP Diliman for tennis. You met some of my friends, though you were very introverted and not as social. Later, we had lunch at Din Tai Fung in Megamall, where you introduced me to my now-favorite dessert, Golden Lava Salted Egg Buns. We had coffee at Muji, where I learned your go-to order is iced Americano. At the elevator in Shangri-la Mall, you gave me your usual side hug before leaving.

When you injured your wrist, you weren’t sure if you could play tennis. I hesitated but asked if we could do lunch instead. You took a day to respond, which made me anxious, but eventually, we planned to meet on October 20. For the first time, we met without tennis involved. After meeting at Zara, we had lunch at Grifoni in Podium, followed by coffee at Elephant Grounds. I was still very conscious around you, but I enjoyed our time together. When I left, you said, “See you in December when I’m back from Thailand.” It was the first time you expressed wanting to see me again, and it meant a lot.

November was filled with thoughts of you. I couldn’t get you out of my head and counted the days until December. Then, as I prepared for a friend’s wedding, John Mayer’s XO played, and it made me think of you. Hours later, you messaged me. It wasn’t much, but knowing you reached out meant the world to me.

I don’t know what will happen next, but I want to keep seeing you and getting to know you. Writing this on my flight back to Manila from Iloilo, I just can’t get you out of my mind.",2,1734027222.0,UnsentLetters,1,0.75,False
