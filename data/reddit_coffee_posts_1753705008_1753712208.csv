I was wondering if there is anything I can buy or think of to make life easier for my bf when our baby comes in about 10 weeks? :)

I bought a wet palette to make it easier for him to paint warhammer but except for that Im out of ideas besides trying to make sure he gets some time for hobbies, gym and friends.

The focus is (obviously) about my comfort after baby is born, but if there are any items or hacks that could aid him that would be great!

Maybe some high quality earplugs? Really good coffee? Comfy slippers? 😂

I was also thinking of ordering bday gifts and wrap them ahead despite it being in november, to make sure it gets done 😅 is that overkill?

His main job will be to take care of me, but I still want to show some appreciation and help him if I can! ",1,1753711970.0,AskMen,0,0.67,False

1mbh98e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1mbh98e/need_advice_on_maintaining_jobs/,Need advice on maintaining jobs,"Sorry that this is really long and I’m not even sure if anyone will read this and it will probably be taken down.  I’ve been diagnosed (twice) since I was twelve, but I don’t know if any of this has to do with being autistic or I’m just irresponsible.  I got my first actual job in January of 2024 but I had to quit because I knew I was going to get fired, so I quit in October of that same year.  I also have Type One Narcolepsy, and I was undiagnosed for most of the year.  My lead who also said she was autistic but obviously had much lower support needs than I did went from loving me and calling me “her sunflower” to hating me and telling me she no longer wanted anything to do with me.  Part of what led up to her hating me and me having to quit and more tension happening in the workplace was an antisemitic incident involving her and my manager and me accidentally reporting them, which I didn’t mean to do.  There was also the fact that my manager and a lead often called me into the office and I’d get in trouble for something.  I also got written up twice in maybe two weeks, and it’s three until you’re terminated, so I really had to quit.  

I found another job sometime in the beginning of 2025, I just can’t remember when.  Anyway, I misunderstood the directions to the location, and I have to take the side streets because I’m too scared to get on the highway (I have major driving anxiety) and I ended up being an hour late and the manager said that if I did anything wrong again, she’d fire me.  I told her later on that I needed the job to help my mum pay for my neurology appointments because I have narcolepsy, and maybe than ten minutes later, not even two hours into my “shift,” she fired me.  Later on, I got a job at an amusement park, and it was going well, but I fell asleep twice on my shift.  They were very lenient, but also upset that I lied about whether or not I had a disability in my application (my mum told me to always lie and say I don’t have a disability on job applications).  

I interviewed for another job in June and they gave it to me, so I quit the amusement park.  I fell asleep at that one, too, and had to go home.  They scheduled me again two weeks later, but then took the shift away, and a week after that or more, when I went on the scheduling app, my account had been terminated, so I guess they fired me.  I thought this coffee place opening up gave me the job, I was invited to their meet and greet and we’ve talked about hours and availability and uniforms.  I emailed them asking for accommodations because the training was all day and I needed shorter shifts due to my narcolepsy and they didn’t respond for a little more than a week but the lead messaged me asking for my availability and I knew for a fact that they read the email but weren’t responding because somehow not responding makes the disability and need for accommodations go away.  When I emailed them again per my mum’s advice and told them that I sought legal counsel, the manager responded less than ten minutes later very rudely telling me that they were waiting for a response from the training franchise and that we were never in any formal employer-employee agreement.  I thought it should be on them to communicate that they were waiting for a response from the training people instead of ignoring my email.  I don’t know if I did anything wrong, but I know that if I do end up working at that coffee place, I will be met with a lot of resentment just like my first job.  And also it’s pretty far from where I live and I’m scared of the highway.  

I’ve applied to more than three hundred jobs and interviewed for maybe fifty, and I’m always rejected except for my first job, the one I got fired from in less than two hours, the theme park that literally hires anyone, the place that fired me for falling asleep, and this coffee job but apparently they didn’t hire me as per their email.  My resume is actually pretty good because it shows that I’ve had ambassadorship with my university and a prestigious fellowship and what I’m studying and my volunteer experience.  So I don’t know why I’m being rejected from all of these jobs because I feel like I’m overqualified, unless I’m being egotistical.  

I have two interviews this week, and every time I have an interview, I don’t even understand the point of going because I know no one will hire me.  At my first job, I’d get in trouble with customers because of my poor social skills, and because I have a very monotone voice.  One old lady yelled at me: “You sound like a machine!” And my mum says I have a robotic voice which hurts my feelings but maybe I’m just sensitive.  I know I have to mask at work because I was born female and it’s really not acceptable to have traits like poor social skills and a monotone voice, but masking is extremely difficult for me, and sometimes I involuntarily stop masking, and I get accused of “giving attitude” by customers.  This similar instance happened at the amusement park.  

If there’s a small chance I’m hired again, I have incredible anxiety about not getting in trouble and getting fired in the workplace.  When I graduate and get my masters or graduate with my masters, I’m afraid that I’ll have this same issue, only worse.  I’ll interview at so many jobs and barely get any, and I’ll either get fired from them or have long periods of unemployment, and I’ll never be able to be financially independent.  It’s going to make me feel like a loser, because I’m actually really good at what I’m studying (International Relations), but I’m still not what people want to see because of my poor social skills and monotone voice and all that.

I’ve applied for SSI twice and they rejected me.  But even if they didn’t reject me, I don’t want to mooch off of the government and not have a job, because I WANT to contribute my skills to society, I feel bad and self-conscious every day because I’m sure that while other people have prestigious jobs in the government or in corporate America, I’ll be some loser.  Part of the reason I’m so self-conscious and scared of this happening is that my younger sister has bullied me from day one for being born autistic because she feels like she never got attention from my mum because of me, and somehow I’m responsible.  It’s only gotten worse and she tells me to k!ll myself and has beaten me up and makes fun of me all the time, how I’m stupid and ugly and fat and have no friends and that I should die and that she’s worth two eve of me and how I don’t have a girlfriend and how everyone likes her better than me, like my biological dad and stepdad.  But I don’t know why she thinks she’s better than me because all she does is smoke weed and she didn’t graduate with honours like I did and she probably isn’t even going to college  and has less friends than I do.  I can’t let her see that I’ll always be a loser with no job, even after graduating.  

I don’t know how to combat the intense anxiety I have when it comes to holding down a job.  I don’t even know how to hold down a job.  I don’t know how I’ll face these problems in the future, or how I’ll face potentially living off of my aunt and mother’s money for my entire life.  I just need advice on how to deal with all of this or maybe it’s my fault that these things are happening or something.  ",1,1753711900.0,AutismTranslated,0,1.0,False

Couple 1 have their baby kaya they came up with the idea. Every one has connections of their own. The past months, andaming pop-ups nangyayari and ang big deal ng exposure nowadays. We really think it’s a good way for us to learn and earn, lalo na’t lahat kami in a good place and can ambag equally. 

Kakaiba kase ang concept ng pop-up event na focus sa mommies and babies. Yung na-mention kong events here samen is usually pang Gen Z—coffee shops, “ukay” thrifts, DIY trinkets, sepia photobooths ganern. We want to make use din ng concept of pop-ups with a different target audience naman.

Concern lang namin ngayon is ano ba yung trending or benta ngayon sa mommies and babies of 2025? 🐣 What are you guys willing and/or expecting to see sa ganitong klaseng event?",1,1753711760.0,SmallBusinessPH,0,1.0,False

Can someone give me a reality check about what's reasonable?,"Our arrangement (which my gf initially came up with) is that whoever didn't cook does the dishes. The problem is that I cook more often and also end up doing the dishes more often, because she will leave them in the sink for days after, which will cause pile-ups and bug/inconvenience me into just doing them myself. 

This weekend both of us cooked, but I had exclusively done dishes, so I asked her yesterday to finish what was in the sink and wipe the stovetop and counters sometime during the day. She agreed, but this morning it still wasn't done. She said she would do it after she got home from work - then she told me she was going to go into work late since she could, so I asked if she would do them before she left (I'm working from home and knew I'd just end up doing it myself). She snapped that I'm incapable of letting the dishes sit and that it's only been 24 hours. I think it's completely normal to expect dishes to get done within 24 hours. I've had a ton of roommates over the years and that's always been the standard (not that it's always gotten done that way, but no one has ever told me I'm being ridiculous to want that).

We went back and forth about whether she had time to do it yesterday, she said she guesses she just shouldn't have sat down and had coffee with me, then got up and did everything (in literally about ten minutes, which was part of my point in the first place), got ready, and left in a huff.

So, I need a reality check, because her reaction is making me feel crazy. Is 24 hours a normal amount of time to expect dishes/general kitchen cleanup to get done? I know I'm being a nag, and I hate it, but I've tried never saying anything and just doing it all myself and it turns out I hate that even more.

1mbh4op,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1mbh4op/why_i_still_hold_only_kendu_over_a_year_later/,Why I Still Hold Only Kendu Over a Year Later,"So, I bought Kendu late June last year, it initially started as just a small passive investment, I hung around in the Telegram and the subreddit but that's about it, over time I have seen various chads and chadettes doing insane efforts in both social media and IRL. Whether that was the 50,000 Certik votes to get the free audit(which only Pepe has achieved, literally Kendu and Pepe) or the coffee, beers, energy drinks, Florida events by KenduSTREET, Kendu Entertainment in India or the many other IRL initiatives, I have been inspired and changed by this Ken-Du mentality. The Kendu mentality is infectious and it is centred around hard work. I have honestly never seen a harder working community and I have monitored other communities, Kendu really is pushing on levels that crypto has never seen before. 

It is safe to say that I am a very proud holder of Kendu and have realised over this past year that Kendu is far more than just a money making machine, it is a place where lots of decent people hang around and I have met many people from across the globe. Kendu is such a welcoming community and with us being decentralised, anyone can come in and push in any direction they want, we are a completely permission less brand. Now Rome wasn't built in a day, nor was Kendu, but like Rome we are here to stick around, Kendu is a multi cycle project and will advance and revolutionise the memecoin space long after me and you are gone...

With a lot of bad actors and a hell of a lot of rug pulls, retail are very cautious about crypto and if we are being real, they are rightly cautious. However, Kendu has something that 99% of projects do not have, we have **Proof of Humanity**, retail are gonna adore our IRL efforts because it bridges crypto and the real world, I personally have drank the Energy drinks and they are great. 

The strongest communities have always had the best returns in the past and I think it will be the same this cycle and frankly Kendu has no competitors, look around on Reddit. We consistently have the best engagement and on Twitter we are also everywhere. Certik is an industry leader and rates our community strength at 94.54 whilst communities in the hundreds of millions or billions have scores in the 80s. Kendu has the highest community score strength on Certik... All the signs are there

**Will Kendu have the best returns this cycle?**

Honestly anyone who tells you a definite answer is lying, but with the evidence and results we have so far, in my opinion Kendu has the best odds to be the biggest gainer this cycle. I am fully invested into Kendu and you should be too



This post was inspired by **soFinished,** I wrote all of this off the top of my head and didn't change anything, so yeah lets see what happens lol

*From MY Fantasy Life:*

*If you read [Guy’s post this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1mbc16d/how_daisaku_ikedas_determination_chapter_in_the/), you would know that Eulogio came back from a visit last night and told us that we had won the vote next week on the bond issue. But he was talking in his sleep last night, “No quid pro quo. No quid pro quo.” What does that mean? At any rate, Eulogio has never been wrong when he has one of his gut feelings. So I guess we won!*

*Meanwhile, we will continue with the tours, coffees, and visits as before. We are so grateful for our consultants and yesterday we gave the four of them nice bonuses which they were not expecting!*

Back to the real world. Andy asked us to read two important articles in the New York Times. The first is about a [school that uses AI to teach students](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/us/politics/ai-alpha-school-austin-texas.html?smid=nytcore-android-share). The second reports on a [convention for homeschooling parents](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/27/style/home-schooling-movement.html?smid=nytcore-android-share).

Andy told us that this has great significance for his Institute. He tells us that he and his team have met with many educators and policy-makers to discuss a new approach to educational policy. 

>“We always talk about developing ‘the will to achieve’ in the hearts of our children, parent involvement. We introduce them to Makiguchi’s concept of community-based education, the ‘half-day’ school, and his stress on efficiency and economy in education. But people always question the ‘how to do it.’ We advocate for parents and the dining room table to co-engine the education of children together with the schoolhouse but many people can’t imagine parents with the time and skills to do this. But in these two articles we see how AI is tool to providing effective instruction and how many parents who have figured out how to homeschool—let alone co-teach their children. The first article provides an example of how teacher work shifted from “covering the curriculum” to building community, applying knowledge, and guiding students’ self-initiated learning.

As I talk this out and write, I see Guy across the table in one of his “deep thought faces.” Good.

Back to the July 4th WT. I wish I had read [Awakening Others to Their Unbridled Potential](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/awakening-others-to-their-unbridled-potential/) at the start of the month instead of at its end. Better late than never, I suppose. 

There’s really no need to quote from it since with the link anyone can study the “brief guidances” over and over. Its subtitles explain seven reasons why we do shakubuku. (1) My Life in NMRK!; (2) Spreading Waves of Joy; (3) Toward 2030!; (4) Shakubuku Transforms Our Life State; (5) Propagation—the Direct Path to Transforming Our Destiny; (6) Planting Roots of Good Fortune in Your Life; and (7) Building Trust Through Sharing Buddhism.

No one has the right to judge what is in my heart or prayers. But I know I have been so busy with the Bond Campaign that I haven’t been thinking much about shakubuku. That stops right now! I’ll start in the dimension of prayers and figure out “the how” as I move forward.

1mbh32m,https://www.reddit.com/r/usatravel/comments/1mbh32m/just_wrapped_up_our_first_family_trip_to_san/,"Just wrapped up our first family trip to San Francisco. Two days, two kids (7 and 11), and tons of fun. Sharing our route and tips","Hi all. Two weeks ago we took our first-ever family trip to San Francisco. Two full days, two kids aged 7 and 11, and lots of walking, eating, and exploring. We did a lot of research beforehand (thanks to everyone who shares advice here) so I wanted to give back by posting our itinerary and what worked well for us.


Day 1: Classic San Francisco highlights


We drove in via the 10 and crossed the Golden Gate Bridge right away. The views were amazing and a great way to kick off the trip. We parked near Crissy Field, which turned out to be a fantastic spot for photos of the bridge. Great light, big open space, and the kids ran around for a while.


We then walked toward Fisherman’s Wharf and Pier 39 to see the sea lions. Morning is definitely the best time to go. More sea lions, fewer crowds. For lunch we picked Franciscan Crab. Window seats, ocean view, crab legs. Very satisfying.


Later we stopped at Buena Vista Café for their Irish coffee. My husband really enjoyed it. Then we headed to Pier 45 to check out the submarine. The kids didn’t totally follow the history part but they had fun crawling around inside.


We ended up at Ghirardelli Square for ice cream. A little touristy but the kids loved it and the sundaes were photo-worthy.


For the cable car, we rode the Powell Hyde line. A few tips from our experience. Get to Market Powell early to avoid long lines. Sit on the left side if you want to see the view of Lombard Street from above. That tip really works. The route passes several landmarks and the ride itself was fun for all of us.


Day 2: Outdoor adventure and local culture


We rented bikes and rode across the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito. We were a little worried it might be too much for the kids but they did great. We made plenty of stops to rest and take pictures. Afterward we took the ferry back to San Francisco. The breeze and view were lovely and the kids spotted some fog creeping around Alcatraz.


We visited Lombard Street again. This time we walked it. Our car was too big to drive down anyway and walking gave us time to enjoy the views.


In the afternoon we visited the California Academy of Sciences. It was originally our backup in case of rain but we went anyway and it was one of the best parts of the trip. The planetarium, aquarium, and natural history exhibits were all well done. Our kids didn’t want to leave. You could easily spend the whole day there so keep that in mind if you are short on time.


We also stopped in Chinatown. We saw the fortune cookie factory and did a tea tasting at Vital Tea Leaf. We had seen comments online about unleashed dogs and possible car break-ins. We did notice a few loose dogs but didn’t run into any problems ourselves. Still, don’t leave anything valuable in the car just in case.


We finished the day by walking the Filbert Steps up to Coit Tower. It was a bit of a workout but the views were worth it. We even saw the Telegraph Hill parrots in the trees which made the kids’ day.


A few personal notes and suggestions


We skipped the LEGOLAND Discovery Center. It looked more suitable for younger kids around age 3 to 6 and it was not on our route so we passed.


We tried the cactus salad at Nopalito. The flavor was interesting but I wouldn’t call it essential. We went after visiting Ghirardelli so it was on the way.


Sam’s Anchor Café in Sausalito was a great lunch spot. We had the smoked lobster roll with a bottle of Scribe rosé. It hit the spot after biking and the view was perfect.


You can walk the Golden Gate Bridge both directions but if you are on a schedule biking across and taking the ferry back works really well. That is what we did and it kept things smooth and fun.


We used redteago for our eSIM and it worked great. Signal was strong throughout the trip and we were able to check Yelp and maps without any issues. Activated it right after landing and didn’t have to think about it again.


Be mindful of where you park in Chinatown. We used a spot near Broadway and noticed later there were warning signs about frequent break-ins. We were lucky but it’s best not to leave cameras or bags visible in the car.


If you are going to the California Academy of Sciences it helps to arrive early. Popular areas like the rainforest and coral reef tank can get crowded fast after lunch.


Bring cash or download the MuniMobile app in advance if you are planning to ride the cable car. We saw people trying to download it while waiting in line but the signal was poor and the app kept freezing.


Next up for us is the drive down Highway 1 along the coast. Looking forward to Big Sur, tide pools, and a lot more ocean time",1,1753711491.0,usatravel,0,1.0,False

1mbh0oc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1mbh0oc/i_realised_im_pretty_pretty_and_how_isolating_it/,i realised i'm pretty pretty and how isolating it is,"so a few days ago i talked to a friend that was a straight 8/10 and the convo went and eventually we got to my appearance and they said that i was ""way out of their league"" i got rlly confused bc i didn't think so and then we went on a rambling sesh

  
it went on for a while and they said that when they showed me to a friend they agreed, i was out of their league, which at that point i was not computing it anymore, it just didn't make sense (as to why will be mentioned later) so i asked if they could tell me someone from real life that was in my league, i kid u not they said ""Jenna Ortega"" at this point i was a 2000's microsoft loading screen and i felt lowkey being lied to

i eventually led it sink in and started digging a bit and asked other friends abt their thoughts and they said something along the line of ""yeah ur like an artwork come to life"" and at that point i still didn't understand but i started accepting it, i started reflecting back on interactions i remember to relationships i've had

now for context i look like a real life version of griffith from berserk (to clarify LOOK LIKE, not am) and when i look in the mirror i still feel the urge to yeet it out the window never to be seen again, if i had to rate myself i'd give myself a solid 6.5/10 but others seem to disagree

for a long time i thought i was just the ""coffee shop cutie"" but i'm above that i have come to realise and suddenly a lot of things clicked; the way people treat me, my relationships and the stalkers 

the biggest reason why this whole thing surprised me is bc i don't get approached much or get complimented a lot, like yeah sure i get ur average ""u look cool"", ""u dress cool"", ""i like the fit"" and from my closer friends or partners i got the ""u have pretty eyes"", u have ""pretty hair"", ""u have soft lips"" but nothing out the ordinary, i didn't get the typical high-school musical treatment where everyone hangs around u all the time

nope the reality is, u get admired from afar, never within ur eyesight, in fact u get even less attention than most people bc ""oh they must know they're pretty"", ""they probably get a lot of attention, ""they are way out of my league"" i'm that person u see once in a while where ur like ""damn ur pretty but ik i'm not even ur league so i'm not even gonna try"" and it's incredibly isolating, a lot of people like me but they leave me alone and sure i might look pretty but i never get a random compliment abt it from strangers 

i also realised reflecting back on my relationships, people letting me do what i want, sometimes even self sabotaging which i never got, they'd try anything to keep me and the worst part is i didn't even notice they were doing it until reflecting on it now

i had stalkers who would kick, slap and even choke one of my ex's, like i have to look at so many things in relationships on top of the normal stuff ""are they not sacrificing too much"", ""are they rlly in love or are they just idolising me"" , ""do they love me or is this just status"", ""are they safe, are they being stalked or harassed"" 

it's like being pretty but reaping none of the benefits and i get there are bigger problems and it's probably harder being ugly but i'm just here to tell this (relatively) little inconvenience of mine and still trying to accept it",0,1753711338.0,Vent,1,0.33,False

A sleek and modern espresso maker that promises professional results in a compact design, it delivers on many fronts, though there are some nuances worth considering.

**Compact Design that Fits Anywhere**  
This compact espresso machine really lives up to its promise with its small footprint. At just 7.7 inches wide, it’s ideal for small kitchen countertops or shared spaces. I appreciated its lightweight build, too, at only 11 pounds, which makes it surprisingly easy to relocate if needed. But it's not just about size; the sleek black truffle finish adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen. Its minimalistic design avoids looking cluttered, with a simple yet functional button layout that’s easy to navigate even during my blurry-eyed mornings.

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact enough to fit even the tightest countertop spaces  
- The black truffle color feels premium while staying subtle  
- Light enough for one person to move without hassle  

[Check Breville Bambino Plus BES500BTR1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08zk13cjn/)

**Unmatched Brewing Performance**  
The Bambino Plus isn’t just an espresso machine; it’s like having a barista at home. What captivated me was the precision of the digital temperature control (PID), ensuring a consistent brew every time. The pre-infusion feature, which begins with low pressure before gradually building to optimal extraction, truly lets coffee grounds bloom and express their full flavor profile. The 54mm portafilter holds 19 grams of ground coffee, compelling me to experiment with different roasts and grind sizes, producing well-balanced cups every time.

I also loved the machine's rapid ThermoJet heating system. It heated up in under 3 seconds, which felt like a godsend on rushed weekday mornings when waiting wasn’t an option. Compared with other espresso machines I’ve attempted, this speed was unparalleled. Add to that the automatic purge function that resets the system’s temperature post-steaming, and you’ve got an impressive coffee-making flow. That said, its power usage, at 1560 watts, isn’t exactly low, so it might raise eyebrows among energy-conscious users.

**Milk Texturing that Inspires Creativity**  
If you’re a latte or cappuccino lover like me, the automatic microfoam functionality will blow you away. I was impressed by how customizable the steam wand was, allowing fine adjustments in both temperature and foam texture. Whether I wanted creamy microfoam for latte art or denser foam for cappuccino, the Bambino Plus didn’t disappoint. It even enabled me to attempt rudimentary latte art – admittedly, I need more practice, but the potential for 'gram-worthy creations is certainly there. However, I did notice some difficulty in managing the wand if you’re newer to espresso machines. Its positioning can feel slightly awkward during the first few uses.

**Drawbacks**  
- Slight learning curve for perfecting the steam wand positioning  
- Emits noticeable power usage due to its high wattage  

**Settings and Usability**  
Breville placed simplicity front and center by including essential settings, such as options for single or double shots and a steam button. Adjusting the milk temperature and texture to suit my taste brought a refreshing degree of personalization. On the downside, the interface, while straightforward once familiar, could be intimidating for complete beginners. There aren’t guided indicators or displays to assist in the first few uses, a feature I’ve seen and appreciated on other machines.

**Competing Products**  
Stacking it up against other mid-range espresso machines, the Bambino Plus excels in terms of water heating speed and espresso extraction quality. Machines like the Nespresso Creatista Pro often come with simpler interfaces but lack the freedom to work with precision grinds and manual techniques. The Bambino Plus, with its portafilter and adjustable steam wand, strikes a balance between automation and artisanal flexibility. On the other hand, I found that products such as Gaggia Classic Pro offer a semblance of similar quality and power but miss out on the Bambino Plus's rapid heat-up times and compact size. Each comes with trade-offs, but if microfoam texture adjustments are a priority for you, this one takes the cake.

**Affordable Quality**  
For an espresso maker with these cutting-edge features, the Bambino Plus feels like an investment rather than just a machine you add to your kitchen. It effectively bridges the gap between home brewing and café-quality beverages. Compared to higher-end machines with similar functionality, this model manages to stay accessible without compromising its professional-grade output. Whether you’re a casual espresso drinker or someone wanting to delve deeply into coffee-making, it delivers great value.

1mbgwuh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WildHomestead/comments/1mbgwuh/no_new_episode_last_week_and_honestly_im_not_okay/,No New Episode Last Week and Honestly... I'm Not Okay,"We’re two days past Saturday — two whole days — and I’m still refreshing James Alofs’ YouTube channel like a raccoon checking an empty trash can. No new episode. No cabin updates. Nothing but the sound of my own disappointed sigh echoing through the house.

I know he mentioned there wouldn’t be an upload last week. I heard the words. But it didn’t hit until Saturday came and went… and then Sunday… and now it’s Monday and I’m still out here, pacing around like a villager whose favorite bard didn’t show up at the tavern.

Watching Wild Homestead isn’t just something I do — it’s part of my weekend structure. A sacred ritual: ""Checking in with James.""

Because let’s be honest: watching him is more than entertainment. It’s like getting news from a place you can’t visit unless he opens the gate. His land is his own private Narnia — except instead of wardrobes, there’s woodpiles. Instead of talking lions, there’s one silent man staring into a fire like it just told him the secrets of the universe. Instead of royalty and castles, there’s a man, a cabin, and a kingdom built one axe swing at a time.

It’s familiar. It’s addictive. It’s joyful in a rugged, pine-scented kind of way.

So yes — I’m aware the man deserves a break (if anyone does, it's him). But I still feel like I’ve been left standing outside the cabin door, holding my coffee, waiting for the next chapter in a book only he can write.

Anyone else feeling the same void? What do you even watch when James takes a week off?

And no — touching grass does not have the same effect.",2,1753711102.0,WildHomestead,3,1.0,False
1mbgwgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mbgwgo/explore_the_shardor_10cup_coffee_maker_review/,Explore the SHARDOR 10-Cup Coffee Maker review: Does it brew perfectly every time?,"**Design and Build Quality**

Right out of the box, the SHARDOR 10-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker (B0DLK75SZJ) had a sleek, modern look that immediately caught my attention. The silver finish isn’t just stylish; it actually matches most contemporary kitchen aesthetics. Compact at 8”D x 6.7”W x 12.7”H, it fits snugly under my cabinet without taking up too much counter space. Its lightweight build (just over 5 pounds) means shifting it around for cleaning or storage is no hassle at all. I particularly liked the LCD touchscreen—it’s clean, responsive, and gives off a premium vibe. However, the carafe could’ve been designed better; it’s a bit tricky to line up for a perfect pour without spills. Other than that, it feels sturdy for daily use.

**Ease of Use**

With a semi-automatic operation mode, this coffee maker is a breeze to use. As someone who barely functions pre-caffeine, the simplicity here was much appreciated. The LCD touchscreen interface makes it effortless to set the brew strength, timer, or start the machine. The controls are intuitive enough that even my tech-challenged parents were able to figure them out without calling for backup. Still, I wish there was an accompanying app or in-depth guide for first-timers to explore all settings, especially the timer function, which took me a couple of tries to perfect.

[Check SHARDOR 10-Cup Programmable Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0dlk75szj/)

**Programmable Features**

The 24-hour programmable feature is undoubtedly one of its strongest selling points. I can preset the coffee maker to start brewing before I wake up, and by the time I stumble into the kitchen, my coffee is piping hot and ready to go. The customization options are a lifesaver for someone like me who alternates between milder Americano brews on lazy weekends and bold, robust coffees during hectic workdays. The ability to adjust brew strength to either “Regular” or “Strong” is a plus, catering to varying moods or family preferences. That said, I did experience one hiccup where the timer seemed to reset after a power outage.

**Winning Points**

- The programmable timer that promises fresh coffee when you need it.
- Two brew strength options let you tailor the coffee to personal preferences.
- LCD touchscreen ensures ease of operation with a modern twist. 
- Automatic shut-off promotes safety and energy efficiency.
- Pause-and-serve functionality allows mid-brew pours without spillage.

**Boons**

The coffee maker excels at keeping brewed coffee warm for up to two hours, which is especially useful for joint family mornings. Instead of rushing through my cup, I could savor it at my own pace. Moreover, the permanent reusable filter eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, saving money and the planet at the same time. For iced coffee lovers like myself, it brews a concentrated batch that cools perfectly over ice—an unexpected bonus feature I stumbled upon.

**Caveats**

No product is perfect, and this coffee maker has its quirks. 

- The carafe’s spout design could be improved to minimize dripping during pours.
- It lacks an app-based interface or Bluetooth connectivity for added convenience.
- While the warming plate is helpful, it occasionally heats unevenly, leaving the coffee lukewarm in certain spots.

**Product Rivals**

In comparing this coffee maker with others on the market, such as the Cuisinart DCC-3200P1 or the Ninja CE251, the SHARDOR stands out in a few ways. The touchscreen gives it a more modern feel than the traditional button-based interfaces of its competitors. Its pause-and-serve function works seamlessly, a feature I’ve found lacking in more premium offerings. However, the Ninja model has more robust temperature control, ensuring consistently hot coffee, and the Cuisinart offers an advanced self-cleaning mode, which the SHARDOR lacks. These differences make each machine appeal to different users depending on their priorities.

**Bang for the Buck**

There’s no denying that this product delivers solid quality for its price range. Given its programmable functions, brew customization, and added convenience features like the warming plate and reusable filter, it punches well above its weight. It caters equally to casual users who just want a simple morning brew and to coffee enthusiasts looking to experiment with strength. Of course, it’d be nice if it included premium bells and whistles like an app or insulated carafe, but for this price, you’re already getting a solid deal.

1mbgvuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1mbgvuu/reveal_the_best_coffee_maker_experience_with/,Reveal the Best Coffee Maker Experience with Keurig K-Supreme Review,"Testing out the Keurig K-Supreme coffee maker in my home each morning has been a coffee lover's adventure. Whether I'm preparing the first cup of the day or making a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, this machine quickly became an integral part of my routine. As someone who has tinkered with various coffee brewing techniques, from pour-over to espresso machines, I was eager to see how this single-serve K-cup pod brewer measured up in both convenience and quality. 

**Design and Aesthetics**  
The sleek and modern appearance of this machine is genuinely appealing. Its silver finish complements a contemporary kitchen and doesn’t take up much space. Measuring 10.6 inches in depth, 16.2 inches wide, and 14.7 inches in height, it snugly sits on my counter, fitting even in tighter spaces. The Keurig K-Supreme doesn’t overwhelm with unnecessary detail, and its intuitive button interface keeps the setup straightforward. There’s no second-guessing what to press—the machine practically invites you to brew coffee seamlessly. 

[Check Keurig K-Supreme price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b08nq3495f/)

**Smart Features for Convenience**  
The programmable settings add a layer of customization that I particularly appreciated. Whether fine-tuning the temperature for a hotter brew or adjusting the strength to suit my taste, I found that Keurig built this machine with versatility in mind. MultiStream Technology is one of its standout attributes, extracting coffee from multiple points in the pod. The resulting flavor depth genuinely surprised me; even budget-friendly K-cup pods retained a satisfying richness. The fully automatic operation allows for near-effortless brewing—a win for rushed mornings when time really matters. 

**Advantages**  
When it came to the plus points, this coffee maker delivered notably:

- MultiStream Technology significantly improves the flavor by fully saturating K-cup grounds.  
- The 78-ounce removable reservoir reduces the need for constant refills, making it ideal for frequent daily use.  
- Easy-to-use programmable options cater to personal brewing preferences.  

**Performance and Speed**  
This machine brews coffee fast. From inserting the pod to enjoying the fresh coffee aroma, it usually takes less than a few minutes. This speedy process has been a lifesaver on hectic mornings when every second counts. It handles both single cups and multiple servings seamlessly without compromising on quality. However, I've noticed the brewing process can be a tad noisy, especially if the reservoir isn’t filled to its maximum. It didn’t bother me significantly, but I know quieter machines exist in its price range. 

**Disadvantages**  
Despite the many benefits, there were less favorable aspects to consider:

- Brew volume adjustments are limiting for larger glasses or mugs.  
- Noise levels during brewing might not suit users who value silence.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this coffee maker to others like the Ninja CFP301 DualBrew or Breville Vertuo Plus shows where the Keurig K-Supreme truly stands out. While the Ninja model offers versatility with both pods and ground coffee, it lacks the straightforward ease of the K-Supreme’s operation. On the other hand, Breville’s Vertuo Plus does provide rich crema for coffee enthusiasts but at a higher cost. If convenience and consistent flavor matter more than extra gimmicks, the K-Supreme holds its own exceptionally well. Also, the removable reservoir provides better accessibility than many other competing machines that require you to pour water from the top.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
Assessing its features relative to its price, this coffee maker falls squarely into the ""quality for price"" category. Unlike many other brewing systems that compromise quality for affordability, the Keurig K-Supreme delivers on both counts. Its reusable filter option also contributes to long-term savings, which makes me less reliant on K-cup purchases. If your tastes lean toward single-serve convenience while still maintaining an edge in flavor, it’s hard to justify paying steeply for alternative options over this machine.

1mbgvkc,https://thinkdavisinsurance.com/general-liability-insurance-for-restaurants-in-south-carolina/,General Liability Insurance for Restaurants in South Carolina,"# General Liability Insurance for Restaurants in South Carolina

By Brad Davis, CIC (July 27, 2025)

**If you own a restaurant in South Carolina—whether it’s a casual coastal diner in Myrtle Beach, a food truck in Charleston, or a fine-dining spot in Columbia—general liability insurance isn’t just recommended, it’s essential.**

At Davis Insurance Associates, we work with restaurant owners across South Carolina who want to protect their business without overpaying. Let’s break down what General Liability Insurance is, why your restaurant needs it, and how to make sure you’re getting the right coverage.

# What is General Liability Insurance?

General liability insurance protects your restaurant from the kinds of risks that come with owning and operating a business that serves the public. This coverage helps protect you if:

* A customer slips and falls in your dining room
* A server accidentally spills hot coffee or soup on a customer
* A patron claims food poisoning from your meal
* Someone sues your restaurant for advertising injury or personal harm

In short, general liability coverage is designed to help cover **lawsuits, medical expenses, and legal fees** resulting from accidents or claims of negligence. Without it, your restaurant could be on the hook financially—and those costs can quickly get out of control.

# Why Restaurants in South Carolina Need General Liability Insurance

Running a restaurant is rewarding, but it comes with risk. Restaurants have high foot traffic, work with heat, sharp equipment, and food allergens—all of which increase the potential for something to go wrong.

Here’s why it’s especially important in South Carolina:

# 1. Tourism = High Foot Traffic

Places like Myrtle Beach, Charleston, and Hilton Head attract visitors year-round. More guests mean more potential for slip-and-falls, allergic reactions, or injury-related claims.

# 2. Lawsuits Are Costly and Time-Consuming

Even if you win a lawsuit, defending your business in court can be expensive. General liability insurance can help pay for your defense and any damages you’re legally required to cover.

# 3. Landlords and Vendors Often Require It

If you lease your space, chances are your landlord requires general liability coverage as part of your lease. Many vendors and event hosts also require a certificate of insurance before working with you.

# 4. It’s Often the First Policy Needed to Get Started

General liability is a foundational policy. If you’re just opening your restaurant in South Carolina, this is usually the first insurance policy you’ll need to legally operate and get approved for licenses.

# Real-World Examples from South Carolina Restaurants

* A waitress accidentally spills a hot drink on a customer’s lap. The customer sues for burns and medical costs.
* A child runs and slips on a wet floor in your dining area. The parents claim your restaurant was negligent.
* A competing restaurant claims you copied their advertising and sues for defamation or copyright infringement.

These aren’t far-fetched situations. These are **real risks** for restaurants throughout the Palmetto State, from small family-run eateries to multi-location franchises.

# What General Liability Insurance Covers (and What It Doesn’t)

**Typically covered:**  
✔ Bodily injury to customers  
✔ Property damage caused by your business  
✔ Personal and advertising injury  
✔ Medical payments  
✔ Legal defense and settlements

**Not covered (but still important):**  
✘ Employee injuries (you’ll need **Workers’ Compensation**)  
✘ Damage to your own property or equipment (**Property Insurance**)  
✘ Liquor liability (**Separate Liquor Liability Policy**)  
✘ Food spoilage, lost income, or equipment breakdown (available with other coverages)

That’s why general liability is often paired with a **Business Owners Policy (BOP)** or customized restaurant insurance package.

# How Much Does General Liability Insurance Cost in South Carolina?

Premiums vary depending on your restaurant’s size, location, sales volume, and risk factors. A small café may pay less than $100/month, while a busy full-service restaurant may pay several hundred per month.

**Key pricing factors include:**

* Square footage
* Annual revenue
* Type of food served
* Alcohol sales
* Past claims history
* Location (coastal cities may have higher premiums)

At Davis Insurance Associates, we help restaurant owners compare coverage and find the right policy for the best price. We represent multiple insurance companies and can explain the pros and cons of each.

# Final Thoughts: Don’t Open or Operate Without It

In South Carolina, restaurant owners face unique challenges—seasonal traffic, hurricane season, and heavy tourism demand. General liability insurance is the **baseline protection** that every restaurant needs to stay open, stay compliant, and stay safe from the unexpected.

If you’re unsure whether your current policy is enough—or if you’re just starting out—**let’s talk.** We’ll help you understand your options and make sure you’re properly covered, whether you’re in Myrtle Beach, Columbia, Charleston, or anywhere else in SC.

1mbgviz,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1mbgviz/should_you_buy_the_best_4in1_coffee_maker/,Should You Buy the Best 4-in-1 Coffee Maker Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS,"Using the Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS has been an exciting daily adventure into coffee-making bliss. As someone who loves the convenience of single-serve coffee but also appreciates having an option to brew for a crowd, this coffee maker has quickly become a centerpiece in my kitchen. Balancing functionality with a sleek, modern design, it promises a rich experience for coffee enthusiasts. However, all products have their quirks, and this one, too, has areas to discuss beyond its shiny exterior and robust capabilities.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker is how striking it looks on the countertop. Its black finish and solid exterior give it a premium feel, blending seamlessly into a modern kitchen. But it’s not just about appearances—the build is sturdy. At 14 pounds, it feels substantial and well-constructed, though its dimensions (12""D x 13""W x 16.8""H) make it slightly bulkier than some other models I've tested. It tucks into larger counter spaces well, but you might need to shuffle your countertop setup if space is tight.

**Customization Features**  
What really stands out with this coffee machine is its 4-in-1 versatility, which caters to all levels of caffeine dependence in the household. I’ve enjoyed the programmable brewing options for the traditional drip coffee—having the machine wake up before me and deliver freshly brewed coffee is a lifestyle perk I didn’t know I needed. The brew control is another highlight, allowing me to customize the strength of each cup depending on my mood. On more relaxed days, I appreciate the softer, milder brews.  

**Positives**  
Here are some of its notable features:  
- Highly versatile with options for drip coffee, single-serve pods, and espresso brewing  
- Includes a gold-tone permanent filter and a charcoal water filter for refined flavor  
- Three brewing sizes (6 oz., 8 oz., and 10 oz.), perfect for personal preferences  
- A milk frother lets you go café-style with cappuccinos and lattes  
- Compatible with Keurig K-Cup pods and Nespresso OriginalLine capsules  

[Ready to buy Cuisinart SS-4N1NAS? Click for Amazon pricing.](https://triopd.com/p/b0bwsmv57f/)

**Performance and Brewing Options**  
I really love the variety of beverages I can make with this machine. I’ve used single-serve pods before, but many machines overlook the allure of creating frothed milk for specialty drinks. This coffee maker’s steam wand felt professional-grade, allowing me to whip up lattes and cappuccinos with ease. While it takes a little practice to achieve the perfect froth density, the wand is versatile enough to also help with hot water for tea, matcha, or even soup—a feature that’s surprisingly useful. However, with such a myriad of options, there is a slight learning curve to navigate all the functionalities effectively.

**Drawbacks**  
While it performs well, there are some limitations:  
- The machine requires regular cleaning to ensure optimal frother performance, which can feel tedious.  
- Slightly large for smaller kitchens; might not fit well in tight spaces.  
- The milk steamer can be noisy during operation.  

**Competing Products**  
Looking at similar products, the Ninja DualBrew and Keurig K-Café are often compared to this model. The Ninja DualBrew impresses with its quick brewing technology and compatibility with both ground coffee and pods. However, its milk frother feels less refined compared to the Cuisinart's steam wand. On the other hand, the Keurig K-Café excels with frothy lattes but lacks the robustness of drip coffee customization and Nespresso capsule compatibility. Where Cuisinart gains an edge is its all-rounded approach—it blends drip brewing with pod convenience and milk frothing into one machine, reducing the need for multiple smaller appliances on the countertop.

**Value Proposition**  
For its price range, this coffee maker packs in tremendous functionality. Comparable machines sometimes require additional accessories or leave a feature or two off the table entirely. With programmable settings, multi-size brewing options, and the ability to accommodate numerous beverage preferences, this product proves that you don’t have to splurge to enjoy barista-quality drinks at home.

Frequent heartburn is no joke; it sneaks up on you at the worst times and lingers like an uninvited guest. I decided to give HealthCareAisle Omeprazole 20 mg, driven by its promise to treat the burning sensation two or more days a week. The product's packaging is simple yet efficient, offering 42 capsules in a compact box, making it easy to store on a bathroom shelf or in a medicine cabinet.

**Ease of Use and Directions**  
Taking one capsule daily seemed like a low-maintenance solution. There’s no elaborate preparation involved—just a drink of water and you’re set. It’s worth mentioning that the effects can take up to 1-4 days for the full impact. Being patient can be a bit challenging when your throat feels like a bonfire, but the gradual relief is undeniable.

[Check HealthCareAisle 1299292831 price on Amazon.](https://healthquay.com/p/b07hd643kr/)  

**Positives**  
This acid reducer comes with key features tailored for people battling persistent heartburn. From my experience, these were the standout aspects:  
- Its proton pump inhibitor formula directly targets acid production at the source.  
- Capsules cover you for 24 hours per dose, so you’re not dosing repeatedly.  
- Compact packaging is convenient for travel or storage.  
- Comparable to well-known national brands but at a more appealing price point.  

**Effectiveness and Performance**  
After just a week, I noticed a substantial reduction in the frequency of heartburn episodes. By the second week, the consistent burning sensation I’d often felt after having coffee or spicy Indian food was entirely absent. On particularly bad days, it felt like this product was my safety net. However, as highlighted in reviews I’ve read, this isn’t an instant fix but rather a build-up of relief over days.

**Critiques**  
While HealthCareAisle Omeprazole works like a charm in most scenarios, there are minor negatives worth noting:  
- It might take a few days to see results, so immediate relief-seekers might struggle initially.  
- The product advises against prolonged use beyond 14 days without medical consultation.  
- Small capsules can occasionally feel slightly tricky to swallow without a full glass of water.  

**Comparison with Direct Competitors**  
Against its contemporaries, this product holds its own. Prilosec OTC is often the first name in acid reducers people think of. While both share the active ingredient Omeprazole, HealthCareAisle’s version has proven to be equally effective yet lighter on my wallet. Competing brands may offer flashy marketing and brand loyalty, but this product matches in performance without a hefty price tag. Alternatives like Nexium might bring relief too, but I found their price point steeper for essentially similar outcomes. That said, for those looking for immediate relief, chewable antacids like Tums might serve as a complementary option rather than a substitute.

**Worth Every Penny**  
When factoring price against functionality, this was a well-thought-out investment. It delivers a much-needed solution to heartburn without breaking the bank, making it particularly appealing for those dealing with this issue long-term. However, the need for occasional doctor consultations for extended use might deter some from considering it a one-size-fits-all solution.

Was surprised by how manageable the weight was.

Paired it with a 1Zpresso Mini burr grinder, and I pre-portioned some medium roast Ethiopian beans for better clarity and brightness. Grinding beans at sunrise with freezing fingers isn’t exactly glamorous, but pulling a proper espresso shot with crema at 7,000 ft hit totally different.

I wouldn’t call the portable espresso “essential hiking gear,” but for longer treks where morale drops on day two, it was a small luxury that made a big difference. Plus, the self-heating feature meant I didn’t need to fire up a stove just to brew.

As I’m searching for a casual new partner on the dating apps I’m running into something I’m not familiar with from the last time I was actively dating. I’ve had a number of guys now lose interest and either tell me they’re done or ghost me. This is all over text, people I haven’t even had the chance to meet yet and do a coffee vibe check. Things will be going fine chatting and getting to know one another. We get to the point of starting to plan a date and then poof… they’re gone. 

My guesses on why would be:
1. I’m not able to schedule spontaneously. I have a lot of responsibilities in my life and work late nights on the weekends. I usually have to schedule a coffee date a week or two in advance. 
2. I am not great at/ don’t desire texting often. I would never get mad at someone for not replying same day to me. I’ve ran into it multiple times where someone will text or send a voice note and I don’t have time to respond right then, but intend to respond later in the day or the next day. Then they will poke me like “hey did you get my last message?” Or when I go to respond they will ignore my message indefinitely. I will double texting once after being ignored, usually a few days later trying to strike up a convo again but if they ignore me that time too I drop it. 
3. I have limited availability to schedule dates with new people. My two nesting partners both travel for work and I prioritize spending time with them during the 2-3 nights a week they’re both in town. I’ve had potential partners stalk my instagram stories or other social media and then get mad I couldn’t go on a date with them until next Wednesday but I spent this Wednesday and Thursday on dates with my existing partners. 
4. I’d rather not text heavily for days before meeting. If we vibe, let’s meet up in person and feel it out. I don’t need a text every day to remind me this person is interested in me. Planning a vibe check and showing up means so much more than endless texting conversations to me. 

So I guess my question is; I feel like I am getting “cut off” so early with many people. I am not sure what I’m doing wrong. I’ve just been chalking it up to “we don’t have compatible communication styles and at least we found out early” but at the same time it’s happening frequently and it leaves me wondering if it’s impossible to find a partner who is okay without endless texting and chatting, doesn’t mind scheduling a bit in advance, and wants something connected and real with a frequency of seeing each other about 2-3x a month. I understand that’s not for everyone, but I’m left feeling like it’s not for anyone… it’s been 6 months or more of this where I can barely get to a first date and once I do I somehow insult or upset the person with my communication cadence before we can get to a second date and I end up ghosted or rejected without much information on why. I’ve had a few people literally send “this isn’t going to work” texts either before or after a first date and I can’t find a reason beyond my communication style to look at.

Something really weird happened today, and I’m posting here in case anyone else has been through something like this.
So yesterday morning, I was at home, fully awake, had my black coffee, played a game of chess (and won!), and decided to study at home.
I reached for my pencil box and it was completely empty.
No pens, no money, no lipstick, just one old note that I had written a long time ago as a joke for my ex. That’s all that was in there.
I was completely confused. I knew for a fact that the box was full of my things. I stepped out of my room (by the door, didn’t even leave the room) and loudly asked everyone in the house if they have moved my stuff, to which they said no. Got really confused.
And then, as if nothing had ever happened, I found the pencil box back to normal, with everything inside: pens, money, lipstick, exactly how it should’ve been.
It was like reality snapped back to how it was supposed to be.
I know some of you will say maybe I was tired or distracted, or it’s something psychological. But I wasn’t. I was sharp, conscious, and aware.
I genuinely felt like a glitch in the matrix or maybe even a timeline shift.

I can’t explain it. But I’m sharing this in case someone else has experienced a moment where reality didn’t add up , and then suddenly corrected itself.
Would love to hear your thoughts.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of slate coasters involves several critical features that affect their performance and longevity. The best options offer a combination of quality materials, careful construction, and practical design elements.

**Material Quality:** The quality of the slate itself is paramount. Look for coasters made from natural, ethically sourced slate, which is known for its durability and resistance to heat and moisture. High-quality slate should have a consistent color and texture, free from excessive cracks or imperfections that can compromise its structural integrity. always ensure the slate originates from reputable quarries known for producing reliable building materials.

**Thickness and Size:** Optimal thickness ranges from 0.25 to 0.4 inches to provide substantial heat resistance and prevent condensation from seeping through. A standard coaster size is around 4 inches in diameter, which sufficiently accommodates most glasses and mugs.Larger coasters can be beneficial for oversized beverages or creative presentation.Accurate and uniform dimensions across a bulk set indicate manufacturing precision.

**Edge finishing:** The edges of slate coasters can be either natural-cut or smoothly finished.Natural-cut edges offer a rustic, raw aesthetic, while smooth edges provide a more refined and agreeable feel. Smooth edges also reduce the risk of chipping or scratching furniture. Check for evenness and absence of sharp points in both finish types. Consider the overall style of your decor when choosing the edge finish.

**Base Protection:** To prevent scratches on delicate surfaces, quality slate coasters should feature a protective base. This can be made from cork, felt, or rubber.Cork provides excellent grip and is eco-amiable, while felt offers a smoother glide and prevents scuffing. Rubber offers enhanced durability and water resistance. Secure adhesion of the base to the slate is crucial to prevent it from peeling off with use.

**Sealing and Coating:** Many slate coasters are treated with a sealant to enhance their water resistance and prevent staining. A good sealant does not alter the natural appearance of the slate but penetrates the surface to create a protective barrier. Ensure the sealant is food-safe if the coasters will be used for serving food items. Look for brands that offer recoating services to maintain the coasters' pristine condition.

**Customization Options:** For businesses or special events, the option to customize slate coasters with logos, monograms, or designs can add a personal touch. Laser engraving and printing are common customization methods that create durable and visually appealing results. Verify the clarity and precision of the customization process to ensure it meets your branding or stylistic requirements.

Key features of the best bulk slate coasters include:

* Durable natural slate construction
* Adequate thickness for heat resistance
* Protective base to prevent scratches

## Core Benefits

Investing in high-quality bulk slate coasters offers numerous benefits beyond just protecting your furniture.They enhance your overall experience and provide long-term value.

**Superior Furniture Protection:** Slate’s inherent density and heat resistance make it an ideal material for coasters.They effectively prevent water rings, condensation stains, and heat damage from hot beverages. This protects your tables and countertops, preventing the need for costly repairs or replacements.

Their natural variations in color and texture make each coaster unique, enhancing your decor with a subtle yet distinctive style. They complement various design themes from modern minimalist to farmhouse chic.

**Long-Term Cost Savings:** While the initial investment in bulk slate coasters may seem higher than alternatives, their durability and longevity translate to long-term cost savings. Unlike disposable or flimsy coasters that need frequent replacement, quality slate coasters can last for years with minimal maintenance. This makes them a cost-effective solution for businesses looking to reduce operational expenses.

**Versatile Usage:** Slate coasters are suitable for a wide range of beverages, from hot coffee and tea to cold cocktails and beer.They can also be used as decorative accents, candle holders, or even small serving trays for appetizers. Their versatility makes them a valuable addition to any home or establishment. You coudl even use them to protect surfaces from potted plants.

**Environmentally friendly:** Slate is a natural and lasting material, making slate coasters an environmentally conscious choice.

1mbgki4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1mbgki4/my_friend_has_been_abusing_me_for_the_past_8/,MY FRIEND HAS BEEN ABUSING ME FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS. AITAH?,"I (20f) have been friends with Ophelia (not real name/20f) since 7th grade. We started as those friends who hated each other, but grew closer. Or as i thought.
You see, we were put in a small class and the group circle was about 10 people. I thought Ophelua and i were gonna hang on to each other, but she kept ignoring me for a more extrovert girl, so i adjusted and went well with another girl of the group, who Ophelia hated and still does. Mind you, these girls were REALLY different than us, my family and Ophelia's were more protective and hers were slightly more religious than mine.
When the covid hit, we were in 9th grade and didn't see each other for a few months, then dissolved cause of change of schools and that Ophelia and I werent allowed to go out with those girls. I still talk to that girl i befriended, she's a nice fellow. I don't talk to the rest of the girls, understanding how they had belittled me, how they had ignored my anxiety issues and struggles cause one of the girls had figured that she was bisexual and had a crush on our physics teacher! I was in peace without them.
During covid, Ophelia messaged me, saying that she was fed up with those girls and reconnected.
Me, Ophelia, and a girl from the group (Ciara) got into the same high school. I genuinely liked Ciara, but Ophelia told me to ignore her cause she didn't like her. I didn't listen though, i kept a fair connection with Ciara even after she changed her school.
For the next 2 years, Ophelia and I kept the connection still since we didn't match with the girls in our new class, until senior year when a new girl (Taissa) joined and all of our classmates started picking on her because of her sexuality. I really liked Taissa cause she was nice, funny, and we had so much in common, but Ophelia decided to dislike her, too, probably because of her religious views on homosexuality. Again, i kept in touch with Taissa.
I published my book in my third language in 2025, and Ophelia's honest reaction was 'why would i buy it? I don't know that language', then persuaded to buy a bag that costs three times more than my book.
Ophelia and I happened to go into the same university, in two different majors, she went for psychology and i study English literature. We don't share classes, but we run into each other and sometimes have lunch.
Ophelia professionally went for lead-character-syndrome after choosing her major.
She would pick on EVERYTHING. Things I said based on my knowledge were false obligations she raced to deny, all of my messages about struggles and bad mood turned into hour long speeches on Ophelia's personality. My achievements were stuff she could belittle by complaining about her bad mood.
Two times, like after midnight, she would message me saying that there was something botheting her and she was feeling she might not make it to the sunrise (her words exactly), saying that she was deeply struggling and miserable, and that could be the end of her life. She sounded too suicidal and yet never mentioned what the hell was wrong. I panicked and told my mom about it, then she opened my eyes to a fact: this was a one-way friendship. I was always the listener, the problem solver, the calmer, the person Ophelia could look up to becsuse she's an only child.
Of course, my mom suggested i set some boundries but what i didn't tell her at the time was that Ophelia is an evil manipulator. You need to walk on eaggshells around her. She's not the kind of person you can easily open up to, not because you will be judged, but because she doesn't care and remember and will quickly change the subject to something stupid her cousin(whom you don't give a fuck about) said. Heck, I know Ophelia's great aunts, but she doesn't even know my sister's name! I talk about my sister ALL THE TIME. Ophelia is so self-centered that every small detail in life is a huge matter to her, except mine apparantly!
Like she once talked for 5 minutes straight about how the receptionist at the dentist got the card pin wrong. Oh, and she expects reactions. I'm not a reacting kind of person, all of my family and friends know this, but it is somehow unacceptable to Ophelia.
My older cousin (Melissa) studies at the same university as I do, and she knows Ophelia. She and Ophelia dislike each other. Melissa thinks Ophelia is self-centered and dominant, and Ophelia just doesn't like cousin. No idea why.
I know you probably have understood how awkward i am at making friends (especially with guys), but i befriended a classmate of mine, (Edgar, 21) whom i genuinely am fond of (the sibling-kind, not romantically, i promise) and being awkward to make friends and social anxiety is what we bonded over. I like him cause he doesn't sexualize women like most of the guys in my class do, and he likes me cause im easy to be around and not flirty like many other girls.
At the time, I developed a crush on one of me and Edgar's mutual friend (Ben, 24), but haven't told anyone much about it, especially Edgar, I don't want us talking about love and partners.
Ben owns a coffee place close to campus, and I trust them cause the coffee shops around campus aren't safe places.
At one point, I thought Ben might like me, since I caught him staring at me and turning away the moment I looked, but that was never a subject of our conversations (plus he told me that he had ended his relationship, we were just talking about anxiety and struggles.)
So, one time I took Ophelia to Ben's coffee house for her birthday, and she found out I liked Ben, so she started to embarass me by glaring at Ben and talking rudely (no offensive words, just the way she talked) but Ben was polite enough to let it slight, even though he looked uncomfortable. Afterwards, I visited Ben's coffee house alone and didn't even mention them to Ophelia.
Ophelia would later see me talking and laughing with my classmates and called them pick-me girls, while they were just being friendly. At the same time, she forced me to hang out with her outrangous friends from psychology departments who offendee me a million times, but i didn't mention it knowing i would receive no support from Ophelia.
One time, I was handling something important on my phone and didn't pay attention to Ophelia's babbeling, so she yelled at me in front of her group of friends, even though I told her that i didn't know her friends well enough to be yelled at in front of them, but Ophelia said 'i talk to you however i want'. Later, I was the one apologizing for not paying enough attention to her and she somehow became the 'bigger person' and forgave me! After that, I walked on thin ice, not wanting to bellittling myself by making situations that would make Ophelia accusing me. This spring, I was on a family trip with my cousin (Melissa's sister) when their car crashed with a truck and killed cousin, her husband, and one of her children and left the other child with fatal wounds that killed him 3 weeks ago.
Once I learned about my cousin's death, I called Ophelia sobbing, she clicked her tounge and i hung up and didn't talk to her for a week. I got sick and period after the crash, and mentally messed up. Ophelia was kind enough to ask me how i was doing a couple of times, but resumed telling me silly stories about her life on the 3rd day after the crash and expected me to react.
Even when we went back to college, I wanted to be with Melissa the whole time to watch her because that's what every normal human does, but not Ophelia. One time at lunch, Melissa and I were talking about our loved ones who had passed when Ophelia interrupted by telling a disgusting story about her dentist.
Last month, something critical happened in the country, so Ophelia was in the chat 24/7 complaining about her anxious mood, but i was fed up and knew that whatever i say would not affect Ophelia a bit, so i didn't reply. That got her even more furious to why i wasn't participating. I had to build a whole scenario about not having signal or internet to reach out, while I could and just didn't want to which was fabulous for my mental health. Edgar isn't really comfortable around girls, and i respect that. One time him and i were at Ben's cafe with some friends. The friends left and him and i were alone for about an hour so we talked about my next book and he gave me some ideas about the cover. It was going really good and productive until Ophelia called and stopped by because her class was cancelled. As soon as she arrived, she began rude behavior against Edgar and Ben. Edgar left only 2 minutes after she arrived, and Ben ignored me for the rest of my stay.
I later had to apologize to Edgar about Ophelia's behavior, but he dismissed saying that there were a few guys at the cafe who didn't seem really safe and he didn't want to leave me there. But he didn't say that he wasn't upset with Ophelia.
I am not a misagonyst but if I receive messages from Edgar and Ophelia at the same time, i would 100% answer to Edgar first. Now what has led me here?
Ophelia has strange boundries that don't work for me.
She doesn't get upset by people's deaths, saying that she cannot fake it. She doesn't accept possibilities, she will cut all ties if you say you might do something then dont do it. She is allowed to have space to herself, but i don't. She thinks she has authority ovet who i like, she thinks i need someone at least 10 years older. She goes on and on about religion and her beliefs even though she knows I'm not religious and don't care.
She sends me songs of genres and singers i dislike. She buys me books she likes, not anything i ask for. If she doesn't like my social circle, i'm not allowed to like them either. She doesn't support anything i do, saying 'we don't like similar things'. She ignores my wishes. She finds a way to make everything about herself. She doesn't take jokes, believing everything should be philosophical and about god. She dismisses my knowledge on everything (just because i misunderstood a part of s.th doesn't mean i'm always wrong). She calls on her schedule when she can, then gets mad if i can't answer. She gets mad if i try a new snack and don't tell her about it. She doesn't believe anyone is good enough for her. She gets all defensive if i tell her s.th about her bothers me.
Our recent fight was about this:
After 8 years of friendship, Ophelia doesn't know my birthday. I remember hers and plan the whole thing ahead, but she didn't know mine up until 3 months ago.
A month ago, I learned about gaslighing and decided to practically teach it to her, as a silly joke really. I told her that my birthday would be 1 month earlier than its actual date (It's august 20, i said it was July 20) and she kept saying that i was born in august until i said this exactly: 'Exactly. This is called gaslighting' and i honestly thought she got what i was doing as a joke.
3 weeks ago, my late cousin's son passed away. I adored that kid, but there was nothing anyone could do for his injuries. I got quiet and private for a few days, but received a birthday wish from Ophelia on july 20  and laughed cause i thought she was continuing the joke.
A few days ago, i finally could call Ophelia and 30 mins into talking, i asked why she wished me a happy birthday that day. She was shocked and mad and told me that I never corrected her on the birthday date exactly and that i was a horrible person who 'manipulated her beliefs'. I apologized repeatedly saying that i never thought an innocent joke would become so serious to her. I hung up saying that my overall wellbeing was nowhere near dealing with such stuff.
2 nights ago, she messaged me saying i was an asshole for bringing up my grief and using it as an excuse to escape a conversation like that, but she would forgive me.
I once again apologized but she said that it wasn't about apologizes. I dont know what that means.
That would've been a careless and dorky joke within my family and other friends, i thought it would be the same with Ophelia.
I'm dealing with too many things at the moment, not just grief. I am sick of dealing with Ophelia's drama. I don't care about her and her drama anyomre. I am fed up.
Am I the Ahole? What am I supposed to do?

I wrote her an email saying things i couldn't tell at that time and thanked her for the time.

I was in a new city, tried to reach her on whatsapp but no replies / messages were not reaching her.. I lost my hopes. 2 months later, i was hanging out with my friends, he made me install instagram (after soo long) and i posed a story, she replied her (place name)!!!.

Initially i texted her im free till 6pm, she too said she has some work so she will be leaving at 6pm. went to a pizza shop as she was hungry. Had pizza, and chatted about our life, work etc. In a perfume shop, she asked me to spray the perfume on my hand and she smelled it from my hand.

We went to a parking lot and she was hesitant to show her car, but then she did. She kept her bag in the back and sat in the drivers seat, asked her standing outside the car so i have to stand outside the car till my uber comes ? jokingly.. she then opened her back seat and i sat. I thought she will continue sitting in the front, but then she came to the back and said move aside, and its just the two of us sitting in the back seat of the car for 20 minutes till my uber came.. talking about countries.. I knew she had a fear that i would leave her after december as i complete my college, i assured that i would be with her..

I asked her help me find a GF, she was kinda shocked and said, wait i thought you liked me.. then i said im just kidding.. When the uber came she came with me and i sat in the car, asked the driver to wait for a few minutes.. and i ran towards her, when she initally screamed as i surprised her, asked her to think about it.. waiting for your reply... she said she'll be busy for the next couple of weeks, and if i didnt get a reply, you should understand.. Then i left..

... and further to a recent press release from the Company’s client HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”),

PyroGenesis confirms that third-party Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of Phase 1 Test #5 material from the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR) further **validates recently announced key technical metrics for fumed silica samples generated by the pilot scale plant.**

SEM is used to analyze the surface features and morphology microstructure of materials.

**By employing a focused beam of high-energy electrons**, SEM delivers high-resolution images and detailed surface information far beyond the capabilities of optical microscopy, which is limited by visible light and lenses.

In the context of fumed silica, where performance and market value are closely linked to specific surface area, particle size distribution, and aggregate morphology, SEM plays a critical role in validating the quality and consistency of the product.

LATEST PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

* SEM imagery confirms Phase 1 Test #5 material matches lab-scale fumed silica results with improved particle structure.
* SEM images exhibit morphology and structure consistent with commercial-grade fumed silica.
* Data from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis – used to measure specific surface area – indicates reactor enhancements are successfully closing the gap between pilot-run and lab-scale surface area performance.
* Ongoing reactor optimizations set to maintain lab-scale surface area performance at pilot scale.
* Phase 2 trials are scheduled for August to further validate material quality and prepare for commercial qualification.

“With the SEM imagery validation of Test #5, we have greater confidence that the FSR consistently reproduces lab-scale quality at pilot volumes,” said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis.

“Remaining engineering efforts will now focus on process stability, yield enhancement, and further surface area refinements – all critical for Phase 2, which is fast approaching.”

Jaise ek invisible thread ne hum dono ko baandh diya ho. 💖 Hamara group bhi yeh notice kar raha tha, par unhone kuch kaha nahi, bas smiles exchange karte the. Unke liye yeh sab normal tha, aur isse mujhe aur bhi ease feel hua. 😊

Ek hi problem thi, main vegetarian thi but vo non-veg khata tha. Aur yaar, woh mere liye non-veg nahi kha raha tha! 🥺 Mujhe bohot ajeeb laga ki woh meri wajah se apni pasand ka food avoid kar raha hai. Maine usse ek baar kaha bhi, ""Martin, please eat what you like. Why are you compromising because of me?"" Usne bas meri aankhon mein dekha aur ek pyari si smile di, ""Sheetal, it's okay. I don't mind trying new things, especially if it means spending more time with you."" 🫠 Uske words ne mere dil ko aur bhi choo liya. Aise chote-chote gestures se hi toh pyar badhta hai, hai na? ❤️

Us din afternoon mein, main aur Martin akele hi ghumne nikle. Humne ek scooty rent ki aur nikal pade Bali ki khoobsurat raahon par. 🛵 Hawa mere baalon ko sehla rahi thi, aur Martin ke peeche baith kar, uski back se chipak kar, mujhe ek alag hi sukoon mil raha tha. Maine usse peeche se halka sa hug kiya hua tha, aur uski garmahat mere poore jism mein fail rahi thi. 🤤 Humari manzilein toh bohot thi, par sabse pehle hum Tibumana Waterfall gaye.

Yaar, woh waterfall kya kamaal ka tha! 🏞️ Ekdum hidden gem, jahan tak pahunchne ke liye thoda jungle mein se chalna pada. Jaise hi hum wahan pahunche, pani ki thandi boondein aur hawa mein ek alag si freshness thi. Waterfall itna khoobsurat tha, pani ekdum crystal clear, aur uske neeche ek natural pool bana hua tha, jahan log nahate थे. Martin ne meri taraf dekha, uski aankhon mein ek naughty chamak thi, ""Sheetal, let's go under the waterfall?"" 💦

Mujhe toh pehle thodi hesitation hui, ""Sach mein? We'll get completely wet, won't we?"" 🙈 Par usne mera haath pakda, ""Come on, it'll be an adventure!"" Aur hum dono haath pakad ke waterfall ke neeche gaye. Jaise hi pani hamare upar gira, ek thandi si lehar poore jism mein daud gayi. 🥶 Pani ka force itna soothing tha, aur Martin mere bilkul kareeb tha. Usne mujhe apni baahon mein liya, aur waterfall ke shor mein bhi hum ek dusre ki saansein sun sakte the. 🌬️ Uske garam honth mere honthon par utre, aur usne ek gehra, passionate kiss shuru kiya, jabki pani hamare upar gir raha tha. 💋 Uske honthon ki garmi aur pani ki thandak ka woh contrast, uff! Meri saansein uski saanson mein ghul gayi thi, aur meri zubaan uski zubaan se aise mili jaise do pyase ek dusre ko dhoondh rahe hon. Har kiss ke saath, woh mujhe aur kareeb khinch raha tha, uski baahein meri kamar par kas gayi thi. Hamare pure kapde geele ho chuke the aur skin se chipak rahe the, meri body ke har curve ko highlight karte hue. Mera deep-neck top aur shorts, pani mein aur bhi revealing ho gaye the, aur main uski nazron ko apne upar mehsoos kar sakti thi. 🥵 Maine feel kiya ki woh mere breasts ko notice kiye ja raha tha, uski nazrein baar-baar mere curves par jaa rahi thi, jaise woh unhein apne honthon se choomna chahta ho. Uske touch aur uski nazron se ek ajeeb sa pyara moment tha, ek shiver mere poore badan mein daud rahi thi, jo mere andar ki aag ko aur bhadka rahi thi. 🤤 Woh pal itna erotic aur emotional tha, jaise hum dono us waterfall ke neeche ek dusre mein kho gaye the, duniya se bekhabar. 💖

Thodi der tak hum wahan aise hi ek dusre mein khoe rahe, pani ki boondon mein hamara pyar aur bhi gehra ho raha tha. Phir hum bahar aaye aur thodi der dhoop mein baithe, body sukhai. Suraj ki garmahat mere geele jism par bohot acchi lag rahi thi. ☀️ Jab main uske peeche scooty par baithi thi, main use peeche se hug karke baithi thi, mera chehra uski peeth par tha, aur uski khushboo mujhe madhosh kar rahi thi. 👃

Shaam tak hum kafi jagah ghume, coffee piye, khana khaye. Har jagah bas hum dono hi the, ek dusre ki company enjoy karte hue. ☕️🍽️ Aur vapas aa gaye evening tak.

PyroGenesis Inc. , a high-tech company that **designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes all-electric plasma processes and sustainable solutions** to support heavy industry in their energy transition, emission reduction, commodity security, and waste remediation efforts, announces today that further to its [news release dated July 8, 2025](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=XchkRjC-0MBpHgSg41hfQmBKCr0-ilOnOj0fSfKVajlHt_EEHM909QAN19a8Oo7CeZ3j5ZCh9uBnP84g30PH6b0vN-baRN2QWT-cKKP71q_cexZJ_E0ABKDEtkLIBHSRr8rDJp3WJ36fKS_y92-WhIbOnV8JCj0_EYV06StP88idpDZ7CnnmgYUAYXJQeTzsDu2Xj1GQ51vPbpdyjJz2UEJMPFPeLl5TfQ92tNJ_lrSm_vsLwoeHM7RKA3my9KPd), ...

... and further to a recent press release from the Company’s client HPQ Silicon Inc. (“HPQ”),

PyroGenesis confirms that third-party Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of Phase 1 Test #5 material from the Fumed Silica Reactor (FSR) further **validates recently announced key technical metrics for fumed silica samples generated by the pilot scale plant.**

SEM is used to analyze the surface features and morphology microstructure of materials.

**By employing a focused beam of high-energy electrons**, SEM delivers high-resolution images and detailed surface information far beyond the capabilities of optical microscopy, which is limited by visible light and lenses.

In the context of fumed silica, where performance and market value are closely linked to specific surface area, particle size distribution, and aggregate morphology, SEM plays a critical role in validating the quality and consistency of the product.

LATEST PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS

* SEM imagery confirms Phase 1 Test #5 material matches lab-scale fumed silica results with improved particle structure.
* SEM images exhibit morphology and structure consistent with commercial-grade fumed silica.
* Data from Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis – used to measure specific surface area – indicates reactor enhancements are successfully closing the gap between pilot-run and lab-scale surface area performance.
* Ongoing reactor optimizations set to maintain lab-scale surface area performance at pilot scale.
* Phase 2 trials are scheduled for August to further validate material quality and prepare for commercial qualification.

“With the SEM imagery validation of Test #5, we have greater confidence that the FSR consistently reproduces lab-scale quality at pilot volumes,” said P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis.

“Remaining engineering efforts will now focus on process stability, yield enhancement, and further surface area refinements – all critical for Phase 2, which is fast approaching.”

INDUSTRY AND MARKET CONTEXT

* Fumed silica is one of the most widely used industrial materials, and can be found in thousands of products, including cosmetics, toothpaste, pet litter, powdered food, milkshakes, instant coffee, pharmaceuticals, agriculture, adhesives, paints, inks, photocopy toner, sealants, fiber optic cables, thermal insulation, construction materials, and batteries, to name a few. It is often used in these products as a thickening/anti-caking agent, used to stabilize and improve the texture, consistency, and flow of the end-product.
* Fumed silica is often combined with other materials to enhance performance. For example, in tires, it is blended with carbon-black to improve wear and efficiency; in batteries, it is blended with graphite to enhance slurry uniformity and conductivity.
* PyroGenesis has been engaged to develop and build the FSR pilot plant for HPQ Polvere Inc. (“Polvere”), a subsidiary of HPQ.
* PyroGenesis has: (i) a 50% interest in Polvere, and (ii) an exclusive arrangement to be the sole supplier of equipment relating to any commercialization of this new process.

1mbgbc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1mbgbc4/friendship_advice_am_i_the_problem/,Friendship advice. Am I the problem?,"This is my first post, and I'll try my best to convey my thoughts clearly.

Firstly, I've never had many friends, so I'm honestly not sure how a healthy and supportive friendship should be, so I need your advice please. Prior to meeting my best friend in high school, I considered myself to be sheltered from the world (or another term ignorant). Unlike my best friend during her primary school days, I was never exposed to the whole gay, bi, and straight thing. So when we were tasked to write a persuasive essay in high school on an issue in society, quiet literally 85% of the class wanted to write theirs on gay rights or marriage. Being exposed to all that for the first time was quite overwhelming, especially because it really (and I mean really) seemed like I was the only kid in the class who didn't know anything. So, I told my friend (now best friend) and she was the one who taught me everything about it, including pronouns. SO SHE KNOWS I'M NEW AND UNEDUCATED ABOUT ALL THIS.

Now following this was when I had the first issue with her, which I never really voiced because the 13 year old me was literally quite scared of being bashed or essentially cancelled by her and others (everyone was really sensitive about all that stuff). Another friend (not as close), told us that she wanted us to start using he/him or they/them pronouns over she/her. Okay I have no problem with that, HOWEVER, me being new to it all and for the last 13 years always used he/him or she/her based on someone's biological gender, I'm not going to get the changed pronouns right away. I'm going to mess it up more then a few times, which is what happened. I really did try my best, and for the most part, I would realize my mistake, correct it and apologize. However, my friend (now best friend) would get angry at my mistakes, and that really hurts. I felt that as a closer friend compared to the others, she should've been more understanding of my circumstances given SHE KNEW I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT LGBT+ AND IS NEW TO IT. However, I still kept on being her friend despite the fact it hurt, partly because I felt that it indeed was my mistake for not picking up pronouns quicker, and another part because I only had a few close friends like her at the time. I was desperate to hold onto someone (pathetic me I know).

Now moving on from the very early years of friendship, past the LGBT+ stuff, when we officially recognized each other as best friend. I've always thought best friends would have each others backs, put the other first, go-out, do nice things for each other selflessly, all that stuff (like sisters). However, it wasn't like that. Throughout the years, I find myself always putting her first. Always letting her go first to choose and pick, always noting down what she was currently into, putting in the effort to talk about what she liked to keep the conversation going (or just about her), trying to get into the stuff she liked. However, I felt that throughout these years, the same hasn't been done. She doesn't know my current interests, she doesn't know what I like or dislike, she doesn't know what I do in my spare time, she has to ask me multiple times to remember, she doesn't really put me first, or has done anything nice for me first. I've treated her to a few things first (nothing extravagant for my broke self), but I don't think she has ever in our years of friendship ever treated me to something. Am I expecting to much for a best friend? I'm not saying go buy me dinner, it's small things like a cup of coffee, an ice-cream, a snack (all of which are under $10, also note I've treated her to these a few times). I know we shouldn't give expecting something back, but honestly these things weigh up overtime if you understand. I don't feel valued, I don't think she's giving me the same effort or friendship back. I pushed it aside, thinking oh maybe cause she doesn't have a part time job (and I do), no problem, that's what besties are. However, now that she has a part-time job, I'm not seeing the same love if that makes sense. Another point, I've told her clearly I don't really want to drink alcohol and go to clubs/bars or those kinds of events, but she keeps mentioning it and pressuring me by saying she wants to do those kinds of things with her friends or plans to do it for her birthdays, etc. In those moments, I don't want to upset her and reluctantly agree, but those cases I feel like she doesn't respect my boundaries (and she knows I have a hard time setting/keeping boundaries because I'm too nice).

The biggest flaw I see in her, is she can be hypocritical. This really made me question her character and our friendship. There are multiple instances, but this one I remember well. She bought some items off this site (a site that uses cheap and probably exploitive labor), and recommended it to because we are both broke students. Of course, being broke I had a look and purchased some items myself. However, maybe a week or two later, she got mad at me for buying off those kinds of cheap labor website. Of course, I was so confused, as she recommended the site and also bought some herself, which I said. Then she goes on to say she didn't know and she's changed... blah blah... she has morals/principles now. Okay, no problem, I won't buy too if that's your moral or principle. As your friend I'll respect that and try not to do the same for you.

HOWEVER, her being a hypocrite a few months later, goes on to buy stuff from other cheap labor website because she sees it's kind of the norm among peers and other friends. Of course, I want to bring it up, but I decide not to because I don't want to upset or embarrass her (Instead I comfort and excuse her behavior). Even after this, she'll talk as if she didn't and would continue asserting her high morals and ethics around me, making herself seem like a better person. As I went back to purchasing off those cheap websites after she converted back too (the reason I converted back is because I never wanted to stop in the first place. I only stopped because of her morals/ethics, but after seeing her hypocrite self, I decided to do what I want, and told myself and her straight up that I will continue to purchase of these sites because I'm a broke student who can't afford much. Once I'm older and have a bit more money, I'll stop). Even now (currently), she askes me when I'll buy again from them (I've stopped for the last 2 years), and to let her know so she can add a few items to my cart. There are many other instances of her being a hypocrite, and honestly I think she's lost a few friends because of that.

Now something a bit more recent, a few weeks back, that made me consider if we were even best friends (and whether she had my back or not), was when I ranted to her about this event. I really can't go in much detail because it was a rather recent rant with her, but all you need to know is that I was the victim first, and essentially I felt bad, tried to do something nice to the guy that wronged me first, only to find out after doing the nice deed that I'm missing a crucial aspect that I paid for (only paid people get this thing, but they didn't pay and took mine). In the end, they got kicked out (which was not my intention). After I told her, she defended them over me, despite me being wronged first by them. Note, I accidentally left out the part that they didn't pay, however, even with that info, I felt that she should've been on my side. All I wanted from the rant was her to say how they were annoying and to reassure me, she made me feel like I was the villain for getting them kicked out. These types of conversations/arguments have been happening more recently, and honestly this one is my last straw.

Please let me know, am I being unreasonable? Am I expecting too much? Should I still keep this friendship? I feel like I just ranted here, but I've bottled up so much emotions, and hope someone can give me an outside opinion if you have made it this far. I know as humans we are not perfect, I'm not perfect, I have my own flaws, but I really tried my hardest in this friendship, and to fix up my flaws that get pointed out. I just want to find a good friend to appreciate me back as much as I do. Where can I find these people?

Thank you, and I hope you all have a good day.",1,1753709637.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1mbgaud,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mbgaud/assess_the_best_drip_coffee_maker_breville/,Assess the Best Drip Coffee Maker Breville Precision Brewer Worth It?,"Brewing coffee at home has always been a central ritual in my daily routine. As someone who cherishes experimenting with different flavors and brewing techniques, I eagerly put the Breville Precision Brewer BDC400BSS1BUS1 to the test. This high-end drip coffee maker boasts a brushed stainless steel finish and a glass carafe, promising a premium experience for coffee enthusiasts like me. After several weeks of use, I can confidently share my detailed experience, both the highs and the lows.

**Design and Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its sleek brushed stainless steel exterior. It’s one of those appliances that doesn’t just occupy counter space—it elevates your kitchen's aesthetic. Its compact yet sturdy build fits effortlessly on my countertop without dominating the space. The glass carafe adds a touch of elegance while allowing you to see the coffee level clearly, perfect when hosting guests. At 9.5 pounds, it feels solidly built, and I was reassured by the robust construction. However, I did find the machine slightly bulkier than expected, especially when compared to more compact models like those from Chemex or even standard drip brewers.

**Performance and Brewing Features**

One standout feature of this machine is its six unique brewing modes. From Gold to Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew, there’s a setting for virtually every coffee lover out there. My mornings were mostly occupied by the Gold Cup standard, which adheres to SCA brewing guidelines, delivering coffee at the perfect temperature of 197-204°F. I truly appreciated the consistent quality that came with this preset. On lazy afternoons, the Cold Brew option came in handy, giving me rich and smooth coffee concentrate to pair with milk or ice.

For those who love control, the “My Brew” setting allows you to customize everything—bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate. Tinkering with these parameters opened doors to brews that ranged from fruity and floral to dark and earthy. I loved exploring this flexibility, though I admit it took some trial and error to nail my perfect cup of coffee.

[Check Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)

**Precision and Technology**

This coffee maker truly shines in precision brewing, thanks to the PID temperature control and Thermo Coil heating system. Unlike the usual aluminum setups in lower-end machines, the Thermo Coil ensures purer water, which does make a significant difference in taste. I also noticed the even saturation of coffee grounds, thanks to the three adjustable flow rates. The result? A balanced and flavorful extraction every time. Breville’s patented “Steep and Release” valve was particularly helpful when I wanted to brew a single cup without needing to leave the carafe in place.

That said, the highly customizable features may overwhelm casual users. My coworker, who prefers to keep things simple, found the settings slightly intimidating. If you’re not keen on deep-diving into brewing science, you might stick to the preset modes instead.

**Included Accessories and Functionality**

Unboxing this coffee maker was like opening a treasure chest. It comes with a flat-bottom basket filter paper pack, cone filter basket insert, mesh basket filter, and even a water hardness test strip. I especially appreciated the dual filter options—flat-bottom and cone—which allowed me to play around with different brewing styles. The coffee spoon and cleaning brush were practical touches as well, making the maintenance process seamless. Still, I wish the machine had a built-in grinder. Adding one would have been a game-changer, sparing me the trouble of using a separate grinder.

**Perks**

- Customizable My Brew settings allow for unparalleled control over your brew.
- Six automatic brewing modes cater to a wide variety of coffee preferences.
- PID control and Thermo Coil system ensure precise and consistent brewing.
- Dual filter baskets (cone and flat) for optimal flexibility.
- Sturdy, stylish design that complements any kitchen.

**Flaws**

- Slightly bulkier than standard drip coffee machines.
- The lack of a built-in grinder might be inconvenient for some users.
- Advanced settings might feel overwhelming for those who prefer simplicity.
- Glass carafe can be fragile compared to thermal options.

**Competing Products**

When I compare this coffee maker to competitors like the Technivorm Moccamaster or Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker, the Breville Precision Brewer holds its ground well in terms of versatility. The Moccamaster is undeniably gorgeous and quicker, but it lacks the advanced customizability this Breville offers. On the other hand, the Oxo Brew is more compact, which makes it ideal for cramped kitchens, but its lack of multiple brewing presets makes it less flexible. Where the Breville excels is its ability to accommodate everything from batch brewing to single-cup pour-over, a feature noticeably absent in many rivals.

**Price Performance**

Though the price tag leans toward the premium end, this coffee maker’s range of features and precision make it a worthy investment for coffee aficionados. If you’re someone who values versatile brewing options and advanced control, it more than earns its place in your kitchen. For casual brewers, however, the cost might not justify the level of sophistication. Still, when compared to similarly priced alternatives like the Moccamaster, the Breville Precision Brewer offers more bang for your buck.

## Key Features Analysis

The best organic instant coffees distinguish themselves through a variety of attributes, from sourcing practices and processing techniques to flavour profiles and convenience factors. Several key features stand out among the top brands.

**Sourcing and Certification:** Sourcing and certification are crucial for organic instant coffee.

Coffee beans must be grown without synthetic pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers.Reputable brands will hold certifications from recognized organizations like USDA Organic and Fair Trade, ensuring both environmental sustainability and ethical labor practices throughout the supply chain. Thes certifications guarantee that the coffee beans are grown and processed according to strict standards.**Processing Methods:** The processing method substantially affects the flavor and quality of instant coffee.

Freeze-drying is generally preferred over spray-drying,as it better preserves the coffeeS aroma and flavor. Using this method preserves the bean's natural oils, antioxidants, and unique complexities that provide a richer, more aromatic coffee experience. This process begins with freezing brewed coffee and then sublimating the ice crystals, removing water while maintaining flavor. High-quality brands frequently enough specify their processing methods, showcasing their commitment to quality.

**Flavor Profile:** The flavor profile reveals its rich, natural taste.Organic instant coffees offer a range of flavor profiles, from bold and robust to smooth and mellow. The specific flavor notes, such as chocolate, caramel, or fruity undertones, depend on the type of coffee bean used and the roasting process. Brands should clearly describe their coffee's flavor profile to help consumers choose a product that matches their preferences. Detailed descriptions help consumers find blends with unique flavor characteristics.

**Packaging and Sustainability:** Environmentally-pleasant packaging and sustainability is appealing to buyers.

Many brands are now focusing on eco-friendly packaging options to minimize their environmental footprint.

1mbg84o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mbg84o/realization_about_everything/,Realization about Everything,"I get up early drink coffee outside and let my brain wander when I don’t have the noise of all my life. Today I realized how much less stressed I am when I don’t make myself do things that I really don’t want to do. 

I know it sounds dumb, but hear me out. When I got tested for ADHD I was talking with the psychiatrist about medication. I was like at what point will I not need medication? Her answer was simple when you have less stress in your life and less to do.

I’ve been sitting on that for a while. How do I as a mother of three and an educator, have less to do? I have to do all the things. But as I have taken time each morning to contemplate life, I don’t have to do all the things.

I’ve taken my time with projects, that I would normally rush to finish. I’ve cut way back on cleaning. I cook a lot less because it drives me up the wall. I’ve been wanting to read two books but rather than force myself to do it. I just listened to a couple podcast when I feel motivated hopefully I’ll get the urge to read again but right now I don’t want to.

I know there’s things we absolutely have to do that are non-negotiable but even in those things that we have to do there are things that we truly don’t have to do. I don’t need to redecorate my classroom every year. I don’t need to have my house perfectly organized by a certain deadline. I just need to keep doing what I feel truly needs to get done, and save some time to do things that I want to do.

I could spend an hour every single morning cleaning instead of chilling outside, listening to the birds. But that doesn’t bring me joy 🤷‍♀️!!! I wanted to get back to running, and hopefully I will. But right now I need the peace of the morning, before the chaos of the day! I will go chase my kids outside later….

Getting my hands on the OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker has been one of those experiences where you realize small upgrades in life can make a big difference. The product boasts a sleek silver and black stainless-steel finish that immediately stands out on my countertop. Looking at it, I thought, “This machine promises to deliver coffee gold, but does it live up to the hype?”

**Ease of Use with Impressive Programmability**

Operating the coffee maker felt refreshingly simple. A single dial at the center lets you control multiple settings—choosing between two cups or a full pot, setting brewing schedules, and programming the automatic wake-up timer. I’m someone who loves to set it up the night before and wake up to an enticing coffee aroma. No fumbling around sleepy-eyed at 6 AM—this machine has my mornings running smoother than ever.

[Check OXO 8710100 Brew 9-Cup Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b00yeykk8u/)

**BetterBrew Precision: What Makes the Coffee Different?**

The BetterBrew Precision Brewing feature is something I wasn’t sure I’d notice, but boy, was I surprised. Maintaining the water temperature between 197.6-204.8°F ensures a balanced and flavorful cup. Whether I made two cups or a full batch, every sip had a consistent richness. There’s no bitter aftertaste either, perhaps owing to the even water distribution from the Rainmaker showerhead. I’ve tried cheap coffee makers before, and they certainly don’t cater to these kinds of details.

**Thermal Carafe: The Unsung Hero**

One of the best parts about this machine is the double-wall stainless-steel thermal carafe. My husband and I could brew a pot around 8 AM, and the coffee stayed piping hot until noon. It’s not just hot—it’s fresh. The internal mixing tube ensures every cup poured has the same quality flavor. Even the last sip is as satisfying as the first.

**Perks**

- High-quality stainless-steel finish adds a modern touch to your kitchen design.
- Rainmaker showerhead disperses water uniformly over coffee grounds.
- Temperature-controlled brewing ensures optimal flavor.
- Fully programmable with easy-to-use interface.
- Pause and pour feature allows serving mid-brew.
- Certified gold-standard by the Specialty Coffee Association.

**Areas for Improvement**

As much as I enjoy the coffee, not everything is perfect. A couple of aspects fell short of my expectations:

- The machine’s height can be awkward for smaller shelf spaces.
- At 10.5 pounds, it isn’t the most portable or compact.
- Cleaning the carafe’s internal mixing tube can be slightly tedious.

**Alternative Offerings**

Comparing this product to others in its category, such as the Breville Precision Brewer or the Technivorm Moccamaster, left me with mixed feelings. While the OXO’s programmable timer and thermal carafe are standout features, the Technivorm boasts a handmade copper heating element known for its durability. On the other hand, Breville offers more brewing styles (like cold brew or strong brew) for the adventurous personalities. Ultimately, the OXO holds its own by striking a fair balance between performance, aesthetic design, and user simplicity.

**Bang for the Buck**

On the surface, this machine feels like a premium investment—but does it deliver value for the price? I’d say yes. Every feature, from the temperature consistency to the SCA certification, reflects quality engineering. While it might not fit tighter budgets, you’re paying for a reliable daily companion that actually changes how you experience coffee. It’s not just a machine—it’s part of the morning ritual.

Ok so he dumped me doubting if he loved me (or if he was ready for a relationship not sure which one maybe it was both?). He wanted to explain his reasoning in person and suggested a coffee shop. Well as you can guess I didn’t want it in public so went for a walk and talked. 

During that talk he opened up about his past relationship mostly the ending for the first time ever. He admitted he didn’t like to talk about it with anyone because of how traumatic it was (partner hid doubt for final year progressed relationship then blindsided him). He opened up about his lack of jealousy for me which he associates with love given how jealous he was of his ex. As we were getting back to our vehicles he brought up how he hates to go for walks and even said it wasn’t as bad as he thought it would be. He then invited me into his car so we could talk some more until he got overwhelmed and walked away, then since I was upset also went for a walk. He saw me walking as he was driving and asked me what I was doing. I just replied “it doesn’t matter, you don’t care about me” and continued to walk. I then got home and received a text from him hoping I was safe and telling me he did care about me. 

So this leads me to question why explain himself? Why go for a walk if he hates it (I told him I just didn’t want public setting) it could have been meeting at a park and just sitting at a bench and talking? Why open up about his past pain? Why did he go monotone and stare right past me at the 1 point in the conversation when I told him to look at me and say it? why did he get vulnerable at the end (like days prior telling me how he woke up early went on his phone saw some posts and cried)? Why would he do everything he did during our relationship if according to him it wasn’t love (his logic was that he was never jealous once with me but when he loves someone he’s jealous)?

I enjoy exploring different brewing methods and machines, which brought me to the Keurig K155 Office Pro Commercial. Designed for office settings but equally suitable for home use, this coffee maker seemed promising at first glance. With its sleek silver metallic finish, interactive touchscreen, and robust features like a removable reservoir and programmable settings, it had me intrigued. After weeks of putting this machine through its paces, I’m ready to dive into the things I liked and areas that need improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**

The aesthetic of the machine is one of its standout features. The modern, metallic silver exterior feels premium and fits well into a variety of interior styles, from sleek office kitchens to my more casual home counter. It’s compact at 10.38"" D x 14"" W x 13.8"" H, so even if you’re tight on counter space, this unit sits comfortably without crowding the area. The 6-pound weight makes it lightweight enough to move when needed, although the build ensures stability during operation. I also liked that the materials feel durable—no flimsy plastic components that can break with heavy usage.

**TOUCHSCREEN INTUITIVENESS**  

The full-color touchscreen on this machine is a game-changer. Setting brew temperature, auto On/Off modes, or even selecting your preferred language (English, Spanish, or French) is a breeze. While some coffee makers make you fumble with buttons or obscure symbols, the interactive screen ensures a seamless user experience. Adjusting the coffee’s intensity with the touchscreen was so straightforward that even my overly tech-averse uncle figured it out without help.

**Brewing Performance**

Brewing with this machine felt like a luxury. It’s efficient and consistent, preparing coffee, tea, hot cocoa, or iced beverages in under a minute. I appreciated the range of brew sizes—4 oz., 6 oz., 8 oz., and 10 oz.—as it catered beautifully to varying caffeine needs. For days that demanded a stronger kick, the smaller sizes truly delivered bold flavors. The 90-ounce removable water reservoir meant I didn’t need constant refills, even with frequent use. It cleverly supports 18 cups before signaling for more water, a feature that’s perfect for shared spaces.

**Convenience Features**

What stood out most is its user-friendly approach. The removable tank made cleaning and refilling hassle-free. Additionally, the ability to drain the internal hot water tank enhances portability. If you're relocating the machine to another space, this function prevents leaks during transport. Small features like these made me appreciate the thought put into the design.

**Merits**  

- The intuitive touchscreen simplifies operation.  
- Multiple brew sizes from 4 oz. to 10 oz. cater to coffee newbies and aficionados alike.  
- The 90-ounce reservoir ensures minimal interruptions.  
- Stylish silver exterior adds a touch of class to your counter.  

**Downsides**

- Though compact, not ideal for smaller apartment kitchen setups.  
- Occasionally, the touchscreen can be overly sensitive, registering unintended inputs.  
- Hefty price tag, especially for casual users.  

**Product Competitors**

Competing devices like the Nespresso Vertuo Plus and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also excel in single-serve brewing. While the Nespresso stands out with its unique capsule system and rich coffee quality, it lacks the flexibility of choosing multiple brew temperatures or the 90-ounce tank convenience. The FlexBrew, on the other hand, provides versatility with ground coffee or pods but sacrifices the polished interface and advanced features like touchscreen programming. Against these options, this machine shines for its balance of customization and ease of use, though aficionados seeking an artisan drip might prefer something more manual.

**Value Proposition**

From a financial perspective, the machine positions itself as a premium product. Considering the convenient features, such as the advanced interface and the generous reservoir size, it’s undoubtedly a great fit for high-traffic spaces that demand quick, mess-free brewing. If you’re simply after no-fuss coffee but don’t care for high-tech features, this might feel pricey. That said, the quality justifies the cost when you factor in durability and the level of control it offers.

Hid me from her family, flirted with others, and blamed me for everything.

I was dating a girl who’d cancel plans last minute, say I didn’t love her, and tell me I’d get tired of her soon. She’d push me away, tell me to find someone else and then complain I didn’t come see her. When I said I would, suddenly her room was “too messy.”

Every time I opened up, she'd say “If you don’t like it, I’ll just leave.”

She kept making jealousy games, saying people asked if she was single. Then she blocked me on WhatsApp and sent me a text saying she missed me. Her mom even called asking if I loved her.After the end.

Later, my ex called inviting me to her mom’s birthday. Then said she missed me more than she thought she would and asked if I wanted to come over. I said no  and she told me I abandoned her, that I chose this. Said I took her happiness away and she just wanted it back.

She wouldn’t let me Take pictures of us about us, meet her family, or even arrive early when we had plans. Every time I opened up emotionally, she disappeared. At one point she even suggested I should use dating apps, then I found her on those exact apps after we broke up.

Once, she said she wasn’t going to a party so I said I’d go to church. Out of nowhere, she went to the party and pushed me to go to church instead. When I offered to show up early to spend time before the event, she refused. I still bought chocolate, waited outside her sister saw me and brought me in. She introduced me to her friends as her boyfriend. Later that night, she randomly said: “Should we download an app and find you a hot girl?”


One day, after I was robbed and nearly lost her contact, she didn’t even check on me. Just said: “I won’t text you unless you text me first.”

Eventually, we went to the movies after a long back and forth. She said she was too shy, then that we should “just be friends.” But we went, held hands, kissed, had a sweet day. Still, she never let me near her phone, and only gave me her Instagram after we broke up.

She didn’t want me close to her family. Another time, I said we never went out because she kept flaking  she got mad. Once, she gave me chocolate and we cuddlen then talked about breaking up minutes later.A matter of hours

So many moments like this. Constant confusion, mixed signals, hot and cold behavior.

Eventually, I called her and ended things. She cried, blocked me, and said I “sent her to a mental clinic.” Then messaged me saying she missed me more than she expected. We talked again, but I found her on a dating app. When I asked why, she said she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I said I loved her  and she said she went somewhere and wished I had gone with her.

She called again, invited me to her mom’s birthday  I didn’t go. Then her mom called me asking if I loved her. Later, invited me over for coffee.

We started talking again. She said her dad was mad at me, which made me spiral emotionally. I vented online. She saw it and told me I used her, that she was insecure. Said she prayed for me every day then blocked me and vanished.

1mbfwu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1mbfwu9/is_she_into_me/,Is she into me?,"Hello, Im M(22) and she is 20, we met on a course in college (i was auditing). Few weeks before finals, i asked her out for dinner.. walked her to her home. She said she will think about it. Then we started texting each other on whatsapp. after 2 days my messages were not reaching her (turns out she deleted whatsapp due to storage issue) We've been talking via email now. The days before i move out of city for my intenship, i said i have some things i have to give it to you like books etc. she agreed and she overslept that day, ended up giving all my items to her friend. In the afternoon, she mailed me saying she is heading for lunch and asked me to join. I went there thinking she'd be with her friends, but she was seated in a 2 person table, all alone. We chatted about our families etc..out of nowhere, she talked about relationship and said she broke up with her BF. We went to have coffee, shopping. I said i liked her and she asked me why? I said she coz you are pretty.. and she was mad at me. I tried to convinve her i liked her for more than her looks.. but she was bit angry.. We then left. I wrote her an email saying things i couldn't tell at that time and thanked her for the time.

I was in a new city, tried to reach her on whatsapp but no replies / messages were not reaching her.. I lost my hopes. 2 months later, i was hanging out with my friends, he made me install instagram (after soo long) and i posed a story, she replied her (place name)!!!. We started texting on instagram then. I went to meet her couple of back ago in her new workplace. Its like 2 hours in train. She said she was too busy and lets meet around 3pm. Went to the cafe she said at 2:45pm, she was very late, its 4pm, and she didnt come and asked her she texted with crying emoji and said im sorry, thats y i said 'around'. Its 5pm, the weather was getting bad, she texted the weather is insane, me: Yes, Im leaving. She: coming, im omw, just stay in the xxx (location). She came at 5:35pm it was heavily raining and she came without an umbrella, half drenched.. we talked for a minute or 2. Initially i texted her im free till 6pm, she too said she has some work so she will be leaving at 6pm. went to a pizza shop as she was hungry. Had pizza, and chatted about our life, work etc. In a perfume shop, she asked me to spray the perfume on my hand and she smelled it from my hand. We were walking, since im new to that place i didnt know where we were heading.. but the road was nearly emplty (1/2 cars passing every 2 minutes).We saw a fox on the road and she screamed..when i went towards the fox.. We went to a parking lot and she was hesitant to show her car, but then she did. She kept her bag in the back and sat in the drivers seat, asked her standing outside the car so i have to stand outside the car till my uber comes ? jokingly.. she then opened her back seat and i sat. I thought she will continue sitting in the front, but then she came to the back and said move aside, and its just the two of us sitting in the back seat of the car for 20 minutes till my uber came.. talking about countries.. I knew she had a fear that i would leave her after december as i complete my college, i assured that i would be with her.. Talked about a story of meeting my previous company manager in (location), i knew him for barely 3 months, but still i went to meet him (teravelled a long distance). If only you were my GF, I would cross countries for you.. She said that was nice.. I asked her help me find a GF, she was kinda shocked and said, wait i thought you liked me.. then i said im just kidding.. When the uber came she came with me and i sat in the car, asked the driver to wait for a few minutes.. and i ran towards her, when she initally screamed as i surprised her, asked her to think about it.. waiting for your reply... she said she'll be busy for the next couple of weeks, and if i didnt get a reply, you should understand.. Then i left..

When we were in the pizza shop, she said we should go to this restaurant next time when you are in (place our college is)..

1mbfrtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1mbfrtx/does_fanativita_jtp5501_coffee_filter_deliver/,Does Fanativita JTP-5501 Coffee Filter Deliver Better Brews? Read This Review,"**Introduction and Personal Context**  

Using coffee filters is something I rely on daily, and the **Fanativita JTP-5501 Premium 6-Pack Keurig Compatible Water Filters Replacement** came with an interesting promise: a one-year supply of high-quality filters that could fit any Keurig brewer. My mornings usually start with the comforting sound of my Keurig brewing coffee, and honestly, the idea of something enhancing that experience was exciting. These filters, boasting activated carbon material and compatibility across a wide range of Keurig machines, seemed like a game changer. As someone who can’t start a day without fresh coffee, I gave these filters an extended trial, and here’s what I think.  

**Filter Design and Material Quality**  

The first thing I noticed when unpacking the filters was the attention to design. The slim, neat construction, combined with the basket shape, allows an easy fit into my machine without fiddling around. Their activated carbon material comes from organic coconut shells, which, according to the packaging, reduces things like calcium, chlorine, and odors significantly. This feature genuinely made a difference. I brew nearly five cups a day, and after switching to these filters, the water tasted exceptionally pure. The clarity of the water alone made my coffee taste less bitter and more robust. At 6 filters per pack, each lasting 1-2 months depending on usage, the supply feels sufficient even for heavy coffee drinkers like me.  

**Upsides**  

- Certified NSF-filtered coconut shell charcoal for clean water.  
- Universal compatibility with every single Keurig brewer, which eliminates guesswork.  
- Compact, thoughtfully packaged design that's individually wrapped for freshness.  
- Simple to install and replace, even for someone as impatient as me while setting up coffee.  

[Check Fanativita JTP-5501 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cb6vr5c3/)  

**Ease of Installation and Maintenance**  

I’m someone who hates reading instructions, but good news—these filters practically install themselves. Each filter came sealed in individual wraps, which helps with keeping it clean during storage. Once out, I gave the filter a quick rinse as instructed and popped it into the filter holder. The entire process took less than 5 minutes. For maintenance, the packaging recommends changing the filter every two months, though for heavy users like me, a month-long interval worked better.  

**Impact on Daily Coffee Routine**  

The biggest difference was the taste of my coffee. I didn’t realize how much impurities in water could interfere with coffee flavor until I started using these filters. With these installed, my favorite roasts (medium-dark) had heightened flavor notes, and my machine seemed to perform better overall. The annoying scale buildup in my Keurig has lessened significantly, which might be saving me from deep cleaning headaches. My partner, who loves experimenting with lattes and cappuccinos, even noted that her milk-based drinks tasted silkier.  

**Drawbacks**  

- Exclusively designed for Keurig brewers; can’t use on non-Keurig devices.  
- Filter handles aren’t included, which might inconvenience first-time users.  
- They last one to two months, so frequent coffee drinkers might burn through the pack faster.  

**Advanced Processing and Packaging**  

Fanativita emphasizes their advanced dust-free processing, which I found to be spot on. Unlike cheaper options where residue can occasionally leak into the water, these kept everything perfectly clean. The sterilization and individual wrapping also ensure that each filter stays fresh until you open it. Bonus points for the packaging—it makes organizing the spares in my coffee cabinet hassle-free!  

**Competing Products**  

During my testing, I also tried filters from a couple of competitors, like Maxtra and Delonghi equivalents. While those do a decent job, Fanativita stood out in terms of water purity and flavor retention. The Maxtra filters left slight traces of charcoal sediment in one of my older machines, something I didn’t notice at all with Fanativita. On the other hand, Delonghi had similar levels of filtering but came in at a higher price point, making it less cost-effective. If you rely primarily on a Keurig, Fanativita seems to nail the balance between function and value.  

**Value for Money**  

Evaluating the cost relative to its features, these filters are worth every penny for coffee enthusiasts or anyone maintaining a Keurig machine long-term. The prolonged lifespan of your brewer and enhanced beverage quality offset the expense to a significant degree. With their ability to remove impurities, reduce scaling, and enhance the taste profile of your coffee, these filters check almost every box.

The Cold air of the Moldoveanu Peak was so familiar, the smell of the grass and the long lingering scent of the house, first stop were the graves, my mother, my father, my cousins and grand-uncle, their tombstones faded, they were carved by a 19 year old me scared and crying all those decades ago, so the first thing was to renew their marks and leave some gifts, for my mother i left a bouquet of french iris and wild roses, for my father a bottle of cachaça and a pack of cigarrettes, for my grand-uncle a book of poems, and while i did my laments i was struck by a powerfull sorrow acompanied by the wind, i'm not sure if their spirits welcome their son back to the house, now that he's no longer a Human Hunter, but a vampire, a turncoat, a shame and disgrace, but i'm back anyways, and they will have to deal with it just like i do.  
I Have been working to rebuild my Family's household, the Estate is in a terrible shape, left inhabited since 1978, had to spend the first night just closing all the gapes in the hall so i could have somewhere safe to sleep during the day, no water nor electricity, it's been a slow work, and i'm thinking about hiring some workers,but one thing at the time i think.  
 *Somnoros* has been enjoying it , the place is big and he can run around the woods as much as he would like, while he's still a small dog for now, he already have hunted down a beaver and ate it without much trouble, the little beast will grow in no time, and i'm sure it will become a mighty companion, i'm more them glad with such gift by the *Tyrant*, he makes me good company and i already woke from my slumber with him lying over my head at least once.  
  
The library is in a sorry state just like the armory,the astral tower, the rooms and the kitchens and the halls, but i'm losing track again, most of it's book burned down during that cursed night, but some of it remain, mostly History, Politics and Folklore books, but among them i found my old companion,  *Mil e Duas Fabulas*, a leather bound book, a  collection of tales, legends and lore , from Etiopia to China, from Russia to Chile, India to Canada, a thousand and two legends across the world, it was there i first heard about the Strigoi, the Leshen, The Oni and the Djinn, by that time it was still young, and all those stories fairytales as i ran across the meadow with a wooden sword and cape calling myself Lord Belmonteanu, Guardian of the Kingdom of Dawn...  
Still gotta try to enter the tombs, but with the amount of wards against undead it will be a chalange, i belive the relics from the dark ages, the best of the best ,  must be hidden deep beneth the earth, and of course, there's the grove behind the Manor, i know some spirit lives into those woods, and i going to have to deal with it sooner or later, be it friend or foe, the sound of the pipe haunts those foggy grounds during the night. 

And now i look my own reflection against a mirror on the wall close to the hearth, a vampire with crimsom eyes, smoking a cigarrette , drinking a elixir of blood and alchemicals to make it taste like coffee and peting a Bratovich hound pup, my Family's sword tarnished by bloodflames fueled by vitae, and even them, i'm at my house, my Home, and for the first time in years of everlasting night and violent hunt i find myself at peace, able to think of the next step as the dark clouds of storm aproache in the star filled sky, may the Red star shine upon me a bit longer.

I go over the details in that post but basically I've had a crush on my friend since the beginning of May and had planned to tell her this weekend, but long story short, I chickened out. I made a mistake that stressed her out on Saturday which made me reluctant to ask, then we were alone on the bus but we (primarily she) were so beyond tired(yk the kind of tired where everything is fucking hilarious) that it just felt wrong to spring it on her like that.

Also on Friday evening, I panicked and made a playlist of songs I could listen to if she turns me down and I listened to it so much that everything just felt scary. All I could think about what might happen to our friendship and the guilt for potentially putting her in that position that I couln't imagine anything else. It's like the version of her in y head rejected me for her

Then I spiralled all of Sunday morning (partly because of the mistake I'd made and partly about the idea of asking her. I was hyperventilating in a coffee shop reading hte confession I'd written. She actually ran into me when I was outside and I thought about saying it but I just couldn't get it out before our other frinds arrived.

And now she's on holiday for three weeks.

The thing that really made me notice is that she jokingly hugged me and called me her wife and I didn't happy freak out over it. I just laughed I don't know if I was too busy being nervous or what, but right now I can't even daydream about us dating.

If it has faded, I'm kind of sad about it. I wish something could have happened. I wish I had told her last week before I got really stressed. I kind of hope it would come back, but idk if that's a real crush then. ",1,1753707990.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I wanted to share something simple that really shifted the way I experience joy—and it’s backed by research.

I was reading *The Science of Happiness*, and one thing stuck with me:

🧠 About **40% of our happiness** comes from what we do and think every day—our habits, our mindset, our attention.

Not money.  
Not success.  
Not perfect looks.

But the little things we *notice and allow ourselves to feel*.

One habit that keeps coming up in happiness research is called **savoring**.  
It means taking a moment to *really* enjoy something good while it’s happening—or even remembering it later.

Like pausing during a nice walk and saying,  
“Wait. This feels good.”

Or drinking your coffee slowly instead of chugging it between emails.

It sounds small, but it actually trains your brain to recognize joy more often.  
It’s helped me feel more present and less stuck in autopilot.

Here are 5 ways I’ve been practicing it:

1. **Pause when something feels good** — even for just 10 seconds.
2. **Use your senses** — what can I see, hear, feel, taste right now?
3. **Say it out loud or write it down** — even just: “This moment is peaceful.”
4. **Share it with someone** — send a photo or text like “Look at this sky 🌅.”
5. **Replay it at night** — I try to remember one nice moment before I sleep.

I even made a simple printable worksheet to help me practice (happy to share if anyone wants it!).

This is definitely not about pretending life is perfect—it’s about *noticing* what’s already here.

Anyway, just wanted to share. If you’ve tried anything like this—or want to try it—I'd love to hear how it feels for you ✨

Take care,

Hello everyone, I am a 43 year old female, have no medical conditions other than iron deficiency anemia. I work out and take creatine and protein powder most days of the week. I do not take any medications at all. I am in perimenopause and my only real symptom is irregular periods. 

Approximately 4 days ago all of a sudden I have this dry mouth which does not go away throughout the day. I drink a lot of water so I think I am hydrated. That being said I have been having a bit of constipation during this time as well. I drink 2 or 3 cups of coffee a day. I have also had dry eyes for my whole life pretty much but it’s not something that I need medication for. I just use eye drops. I also feel fatigued a lot if the time and I think that has to do with my anemia. 

Would anyone know what might be going on? Could it be related to perimenopause? Is this common and has anyone else experienced it? Is it the coffee? Should I stop taking creatine and protein powder? This started all of a sudden. I will drink more water today and see if it helps but it is weird and a very uncomfortable feeling.",1,1753707665.0,Menopause,5,1.0,False

My doctor is retiring in December this year and I’m gonna miss him a lot I wrote up a note for him that I want to give him in November before he leaves the thing is though the note is very sentimental and heartfelt and although he’s very nice I’m afraid it will weird him out there note is down below ..please be honest with me is this note too much I mean I might still send it to him when he retires regardless but yeah I don’t know ….

(Hi [Redacted],
(This letter might catch you off guard — or maybe even make you feel something. Either way, I couldn’t let you retire without saying this.)

I knew I would give you this note right before you retire — because to be very, very honest… I’m gonna miss you. My whole family will. But I will too.
You’re the one who helped literally birth me — of course I’m gonna miss you.

I remember as a kid coming to the hospital, wandering the halls, walking past you and seeing your beard and your smile. You always brought such a vibrant sense of commitment that many in this practice don’t hold. And even though I wish I could clone you to be my family doctor forever, even the clone wouldn’t be able to replicate you.

And I guess that’s what’s so peculiar about life — you only get one, and that one life can leave marks across many people’s souls.

Yeah, I might be getting too emotional — and maybe you seem like just a doctor to most — but you were like the last part of the nostalgia of my childhood.
I know you’ve had to stay professional all these years — but I’m the patient, so I get to be a little sentimental, right?

I remember playing my DS Lite in the waiting room, waiting for checkups with you. I would play Pokémon and Mario Party. You always made me feel comfortable — made me feel not embarrassed about my body. And that’s important, especially for a doctor.

You never judged. You always spoke with intent. And even though being a doctor probably prevents you from being outwardly emotional, the way you care comes through in your body language and your mannerisms. That mattered ten years ago — and it still matters now.

I remember the darkness that used to overshadow my mom’s car as she drove me downtown to see you. Something about the air back then felt different — even the colors of the world seemed better. And every time I saw you, I remember loving that specific doctor hand soap smell that every doctor walks around with. Ha ha. Guess it comes from washing your hands a lot. It’s strange the little things that stay with you, but they do.

After my checkups, my mom would always take me to the nearest Tim Hortons or Coffee Time and buy me a donut, telling me I did a good job. I started to look forward to those visits — not just for the treat, but because I got to see that warm, wakeful smile you always had. You made the hospital feel like a safe place.

But time moves on — and it never asks for permission. It kind of just happens and you look in the mirror and years have gone by.

You’ve dedicated your life to saving other people’s lives — and mine is one of them.

Right now, I’m in the middle of my struggles, but I do hope to be an author one day. My first book is a low fantasy story, and there’s actually a version of you in it — just your niceness, the way you are. The character’s name is literally [Redacted]. I hope you don’t mind.

I really hope the book makes its way to an agent and publisher one day… but for now, I’m focusing on my health and trying to build a better future.

If I do get published one day, I’ll be writing under the name (redacted). Just thought I’d share that with you — in case you ever see it and wonder if it’s me… it is.

There’s a musical I love dearly called Wicked. In the second act, two characters sing a song called For Good. It’s always stuck with me — and honestly, it reminds me of you.

The lyrics go:
“I’ve heard it said
That people come into our lives for a reason
Bringing something we must learn
And we are led
To those who help us most to grow
If we let them
And we help them in return”

You’ve done so much for me — more than you probably realize.

Another part of the song says:
“Who can say if I’ve been changed for the better?
But because I knew you
I have been changed for good.”

And this part always hits me the hardest:
“It well may be
That we will never meet again
In this lifetime
So let me say before we part
So much of me
Is made of what I learned from you
You’ll be with me
Like a handprint on my heart.”

Truly — thank you, [Redacted], for your years of service.
You’ve done so good.
And although we may not meet again in this lifetime, I just want to say:
You’ve done something special.

The seasons will come upon us like so —
First, the snow…
The winter’s air is cold,
And spring is here to hold.
With summer’s tempo, it finds its way to me
And fall brings the kind of quiet that makes me remember you—see.
I don’t know why, but I feel like in all four seasons, I’ll think about you from time to time.
Maybe in the stillness. Maybe in the air.
But you’ll be there, somewhere.

Your loving patient, it’s been a good one.

Great… high Respect

I usually use **Lavazza Oro** and grind at the **finest setting**possible. Recently, I started experimenting with **Illy Classico** beans instead.

Despite trying multiple grind settings, I can't seem to find the sweet spot for a solid, satisfying shot. My current setup:

* Grinder setting: varies (tried from finest to coarser)
* Water temperature: max (4/4)
* Coffee quantity: max
* Shot output: 30g
* Shot time: 15–20 seconds

The problem? The **grinds turn yellow very quickly during extraction**, and the espresso tastes **thin and watery**, lacking the richness I'm aiming for. It's been like this since I bought the machine. I'm wondering:

* Is this an issue with the **machine's limitations**?
* Are my **settings wrong**?
* Would it help to use a **bean blend with more robusta**?

This is how the contractor left things when they demoed out what was here before.

The drain pipe entry is about a foot below the bottom of the sink, so I should have enough room for a p-trap and still enough drop in the pipe.  I’d plan to secure everything to the wall behind the unit with brackets.

1mbf5tg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mbf5tg/husband_says_we_havent_learned_adulting/,Husband says we haven't learned adulting,"My husband doesn't think we have reached the adulting stage if there are ever dishes in the sink or laundry that isn't folded and put away. Both of which are my tasks entirely. 

We have a toddler that I take care of entirely on my own for the most part. He will ""help"" but I have to give step by step directions that are not typically followed well and I have to fix. He hardly eats the food I cook even though I am a good cook. He wants me to cook more, but it's hard when I'm taking care of the toddler to also spend my entire day in the kitchen.  I also hate the idea and taking time to cook a meal for my husband knowing that he won't eat much if it. 

My husband also likes to cook but only what he is in the mood for. Many times it's too spicy for myself or the toddler. He also cooks dishes that require the use of every bowl and pot we own. Lots of chopping and simmering for hours. This means when he is home he is in the kitchen not spending time with his child. I have to corral my child to stay out of the kitchen when all my child wants is to hang out with daddy. 

I can't get laundry folded during this time because I'm keeping my toddler actively engaged. I don't want my toddler sitting in front of the TV. We play, do various activities working on fine and gross motor skills, go to the park, play water activities, go to the library... I do put spending time with my toddler over making sure the kitchen is sparkling and laundry is folded. 

When we go places as a family I pick out everyone's clothes and wake everyone up. This past Sunday my husband woke up late. I still needed to get a shower, but my child was already awake, so we needed to tag team getting ready. I went and got my husband up told him I needed to shower. I got his outfit ready, took my shower he ""fed the toddler"" a banana and some toast. I didn't know how much toast or how much banana, but I know my child would not be full and we were going out so I brought all my hair care and makeup down with me so I could multitask finishing getting ready, feeding my toddler, make coffee.

 I gave my toddler half a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ""I know not the best breakfast"" and an avocado. I would check up on him back and forth while doing my hair and getting dressed. All this time my husband is upstairs just getting himself ready. I didn't get my toddler into his outfit yet because he was still eating. I thought my husband could do that. I was also making the coffee while getting myself ready. 

 I had to grind the beans, fill the coffee maker and all that stuff. It's not a time consuming process or anything and I really needed coffee. My toddler isn't sleeping at night alone right now. I am up a lot trying to  resettle. I don't get more than 5 hours of sleep a night.

My husband comes down, I am almost ready, he complains about the outfit my son is going to wear. I finish in the bathroom, just need to throw  my shirt on and pour the coffee add some creamer. He is irate that I am pouring coffee when we are going to be late. He is still getting our child dressed. I pack what the toddler needs, get my things and am at the door with everything at the same time as my husband. He yells at me the entire way to where we are going because we will be literally 2 minutes late he says everyone will comment on why we are always late and will think something like ""well look at his wife"" essentially implying that it's because I'm overweight. 

I am overweight, I was overweight when we met, when we got married and he loved me. My weight fluctuates I had a child lost a lot, he never commented...I've gained some back. It's been difficult this last year my husband was away and I took care of our child alone for the year while working and getting things ready to move to another state. Only just moved had to unpack the house myself.  He comments how I need to go to the gym but I have no one to watch my son.

We get home from where we were and he comments about my weight and says he never should have married at fat woman and do I not care that when we walk into a room I am one of the fattest. Then he starts yelling about the fact that I made coffee and that I need to learn adulting because there were dishes in the sink and clothes not folded. 

As soon as we got home he commented that our child couldn't be hungry because he had a big breakfast. So I go out and set up the kiddie pool hand my husband the child's swimsuit to put on and I take our toddler outside. I haven't changed out of my nice clothes yet or anything. So I'm outside in the blazing heat playing with my son. My husband decides he wants to make something so he goes to the store and only buys the couple ingredients he needs for his one dish. We need other things like eggs and cheese and some items for our toddler.  

Before he leaves he asks me to do dishes before he gets back. I literally been outside for the last hour playing with our son I have had no break. So I get our son inside, dry him off change his outfit and do the dishes. He gets home and makes a comment on why I haven't fed our child. I explain that I told him while we were out that I had something in mind to make but that he told me our child couldn't be hungry, so I didn't make anything and instead took our toddler outside. He never remembers me saying anything about what I planned to feed our toddler. He never remembers when I have told him things.  

Anyway, such a long vent. I doubt anyone will read it but I feel better....

1mbf5g3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mbf5g3/should_you_invest_in_the_xbloom_studio_coffee/,Should You Invest in the xBloom Studio Coffee Maker for Perfect Brews?,"Testing the xBloom Studio FW-02A-01 coffee maker for weeks has been quite an adventure. Right out of the box, its sleek minimalist design in Midnight Black made it look more like a high-tech gadget than your everyday kitchen appliance. I had to remind myself it was there to brew coffee and not beam me up somewhere. This machine does more than just brew—it reinvents the experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker feels premium in every sense. Its compact dimensions—8"" deep, 6.7"" wide, and 14.75"" high—ensure it fits snugly on my already crowded counter. I appreciate the matte finish as it resists pesky fingerprints that often plague glossy surfaces. Despite its minimalist appearance, its thoughtful layout showcases ergonomic functionality, from the magnetic dosing cup to the Hyperflow bottom in the Omni Dripper 2. The intuitive dial for operations adds to its high-tech vibe while making fine-tuning straightforward. It's a statement piece as much as it is a machine.

**Brewing Performance**

The real test of a coffee maker is in the brewing, and the result here? Spectacular. The xBloom Studio provides 3 automation levels: Autopilot, Copilot, and Freesolo. Each mode caters to specific comfort zones of coffee enthusiasts. Autopilot delivers ease by automating nearly the entire process; Copilot lets you join the journey with some manual input; Freesolo is for control freaks like me, who want to tweak every variable. I brewed everything from pour-over to mocha, latte, and even experimented with an Americano—it excelled at them all. Grind, weigh, mix, and brew turn into an innovative process that feels more like DJing your morning coffee than pressing a simple “on” button.

**Advantages**

- 3 customizable brewing automation levels, catering to pros and beginners alike.
- Tactile knobs and LED matrix ensure an intuitive and interactive user experience.
- Integrated coffee grinder eliminates the need for a separate unit.
- Sleek and compact design saves counter space without sacrificing capacity or style.

[Check xBloom FW-02A-01 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0dkkly1v9/)

**App Integration**

The app control is one of the most surprising additions. Pairing it with the machine was seamless, and it didn’t feel like a gimmick; it’s genuinely helpful. Through the app, I adjusted brew settings, saved my recipes, and even shared them with friends (because coffee nerds always want to outdo each other). It allowed me to be playful and try variations I wouldn’t have otherwise attempted. However, one minor hiccup is the occasional lag when the app syncs with the machine, but nothing that disrupted my overall experience.

**Drawbacks**

- Occasional app lag during sync which might frustrate those relying solely on smart controls.
- Paper filter requirement feels a bit dated compared to reusable eco-friendly options.
- Limited to xPods for optimally streamlined brewing, which makes experimentation slightly constrained.

**Other Options**

Coffee machines in the same category, like the Breville Bambino Plus or the Technivorm Moccamaster, target similar audiences. The xBloom Studio, however, distinguishes itself through its integrated grinder and app-based customization. The Breville offers exceptional espresso performance but lacks the versatility seen in the xBloom's brewing abilities. Meanwhile, the Moccamaster’s classic drip technique is simple yet restrictive compared to modern app-controlled functionality in the xBloom. Where rivals excel in focused features, this product boasts a multi-functional usability that sits comfortably across different coffee styles.

**Value Proposition**

The xBloom Studio might not be for everyone given its price range, but for true coffee enthusiasts, it feels worth it. It combines versatility, quality, and flair into a single machine, making it an optimal blend of luxury and utility. While its cost is expectedly higher than a basic drip coffee maker, the features, precision, and premium build provide a return on investment that coffee aficionados can appreciate. It’s a hybrid of a high-end Swiss Army knife for your coffee-making needs and a stylish kitchen centerpiece all rolled into one.

1mbf4s9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1mbf4s9/the_home/,The Home,"This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn’t be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.  Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn’t want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn’t own a lot, and anyway, I wasn’t coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of *Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn’t like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn’t. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn’t bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn’t been updated since the 80’s, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn’t too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA’s, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident’s beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly. 

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I’ve never told anyone:

I’m terrified of old people.

I don’t know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it’s just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn’t bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading *Salem’s Lot* by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn’t need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA’s, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn’t want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch *Supernatural.* Sometimes we’d shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched *Nosferatu* at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria’s are garbage, but the Home’s food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA’s and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn’t for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don’t exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they’d quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn’t complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing *Elden Ring* and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn’t have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn’t mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn’t want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn’t looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my *Beserk* brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn’t know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into *Beserk* too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. “For shift exchanges,” she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying “sure.” I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn’t have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we’d play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn’t have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I’d ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn’t really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA’s hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn’t talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn’t really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn’t want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn’t have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That’s when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won’t go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don’t know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena’s phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena’s name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn’t respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she’d ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn’t risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn’t hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

“Get up. Get over it. You have a life to live,” she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn’t a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena’s apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn’t bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn’t want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn’t true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don’t think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a “Lena” living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I *knew* I wasn’t crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn’t said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn’t know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn’t sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for: 

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn’t a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly’s for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn’t do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss’s office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home’s records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.  I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss’s door was locked.

It wasn’t.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA’s about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly’s screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read “archived footage”. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said “Footage moved to Secondary Storage.”

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren’t allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn’t closed the camera window.

She didn’t look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

“I always forget the damn spoon.”

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA’s in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn’t familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren’t usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that  I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss’s keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn’t even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet’s handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn’t recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.  I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don’t know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn’t take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn’t care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn’t say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn’t go home. I didn’t trust my apartment was safe. 

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS’s and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled “Lena” and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly’s room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn’t remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn’t turn. It didn’t look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena’s neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly’s arms began to expand and contort. Lena’s body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly’s fingers and into her body. 

Lena’s body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly’s arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena’s mouth was open in a scream I couldn’t hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly’s hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly’s form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn’t look away. I hated it, but I couldn’t stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word “Evidence” written on it.

I was a coward. I should’ve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should’ve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I’ve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don’t require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don’t ask questions.

But I know now I haven’t run far enough. For the past month, I’ve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don’t know how much longer I can last.

There’s a reason I haven’t said the location of the Home, or even which state it’s in.

I can’t remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can’t even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there’s a blank space where it should be.

I can’t find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I’m going crazy.

But I know it’s real. I can’t forget what I’ve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it’s only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can’t say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It’s like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

# Chapter 1: An Incidental Summit

In the early days of March 2025, a damp chill still clung to Warsaw. From his office in the Chancellery of the Prime Minister, Donald Tusk watched the city emerge from the grey shroud of winter. The view was a familiar tapestry of restored Gothic spires and socialist-era blocks, a landscape written over by history, much like his own life. At sixty-seven, he was back in the seat of power he had held for seven years before his tenure in Brussels, a return that felt both triumphant and profoundly exhausting. The victory had been celebrated as a restoration of democracy, a bulwark against the populist tide that had swept his country. But the daily reality was a grind of managing a fractious coalition, fending off the relentless attacks of the PiS opposition, and navigating the labyrinthine politics of the European Union. 

He turned from the window, his gaze falling on the stack of briefing documents on his desk. The upcoming state visit of the President of Mongolia, Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh. On the scale of geopolitical priorities, it was a minor event, a diplomatic courtesy wedged between a tense NATO defense ministers' meeting and a fraught budget debate in the Sejm. Yet, the sheer volume of paperwork was impressive. A Joint Declaration on Establishing a Comprehensive Partnership, commemorating seventy-five years of diplomatic relations, and a cascade of Memoranda of Understanding covering everything from paleontology and classical music to defense cooperation and medical device regulation.Tusk, a historian by training, felt a flicker of academic curiosity. Poland and Mongolia. Two nations at opposite ends of the Eurasian landmass, their histories shaped by the colossal empires that flanked them.  

An aide entered with a cup of black coffee. ""Sir, the final schedule for President Khürelsükh's arrival.""

Tusk took the cup. ""Any media interest?""

The aide hesitated. ""Some, of course. The usual diplomatic beat. But it's not exactly leading the news cycle. They're more interested in the latest polling numbers.""

Tusk gave a thin, wry smile. It was the story of his second premiership. Admired abroad as the statesman who had stared down populism, but at home, a polarizing figure whose government was already facing criticism for its perceived lack of progress. He suffered from what some journalists had dubbed ""Gorbachev syndrome"": a hero to the world, a divisive figure in his own country. This visit, then, was a brief respite. It was diplomacy removed from the immediate, existential crises that defined his daily life—the war in Ukraine, the hardening stance on migration, the constant vigilance against Russian aggression. This was about building something, not just defending against it. It was a state visit from a ""Third Neighbor,"" a term the Mongolians used for their policy of cultivating relationships beyond their two powerful immediate neighbors, Russia and China. Perhaps, he mused, he needed a third neighbor himself, a space free from the suffocating pressures of his immediate political geography. He picked up the top document, the biography of his counterpart. Born in Ulaanbaatar, a former military officer, a political organizer who had led demonstrations and hunger strikes, and a politician known by the formidable nickname ""The Fist"". Tusk settled into his chair, the historian in him intrigued by the man who was coming from the land of Chinggis Khaan to the city of Chopin.  

# Chapter 2: The Fist and the Historian

The official welcome was a meticulously choreographed affair of honor guards and anthems. When Donald Tusk finally stood before Ukhnaagiin Khürelsükh, he found the man more imposing in person than in his photographs. Khürelsükh was built like the wrestlers Tusk had seen in documentaries about Mongolia, a solid block of a man with a quiet, immovable gravity.His background as a military officer was evident in his perfect posture, a discipline that seemed etched into his very frame. 

Tusk extended his hand, meeting the Mongolian president's gaze. The handshake was firm, the eye contact direct, a sign of sincerity in Polish culture.Tusk had prepared for the ""macho"" persona, the Putin-esque strongman suggested by the ""Fist"" moniker.But what he encountered was different. There was no theatrical swagger, only a profound stillness, an observant silence that seemed to absorb the room.  

Inside, after the initial exchange of pleasantries, they sat across from each other, flanked by their delegations. Tusk decided to depart from the script.

""Mr. President,"" he began, his voice measured, ""as a student of history, I have often thought about the parallels between our nations. Poland has spent centuries defining itself against the ambitions of its larger neighbors. It seems to me that your 'Third Neighbor' policy is a modern expression of a very old and necessary wisdom."" 

A flicker of surprise registered in Khürelsükh's dark eyes. He had been prepared for the standard European politician, a man of smooth words and calculated cordiality. He had not expected this direct, intellectual opening.

""Prime Minister,"" Khürelsükh's voice was a low baritone, his words chosen with an economy that made each one land with weight. ""A nation that does not understand its own geography is doomed to be consumed by it. We seek partners, not masters. It is a simple principle, but one that requires constant vigilance.""

In that moment, a current of understanding passed between them, a recognition that went deeper than their official roles. Tusk, the anti-communist student leader who had witnessed police shoot striking workers in Gdańsk, who had worked as a chimney painter and manual laborer to survive under a repressive regime, recognized the steel in the other man.He saw not just a president, but a fellow survivor. Khürelsükh, who had resigned his military commission to maintain his political ideals, who had organized protests and hunger strikes against the political establishment of his time, saw not just a European liberal, but a man who understood the language of struggle. 

Their shared history was not one of ideology but of defiance. Tusk, a Kashubian minority who grew up knowing that ""nothing is simple in life or in history,"" felt an immediate affinity for this leader from a nation of nomads, a man who had to navigate a world of giants.The first conversation was not about trade figures or policy alignment. It was about the fundamental act of carving out a space for one's people to exist, sovereign and free. The Fist and the Historian had found their common ground.  

# Chapter 3: Signatures and Subtext

The signing ceremonies took place in a grand hall of the Presidential Palace, a flurry of gold-plated pens and crisp documents. For Tusk, such events were often a tedious but necessary part of the job. This time, however, it felt different. The sheer variety of the agreements transformed the staid diplomatic ritual into a series of brief, illuminating conversations, an accidental courtship conducted through memoranda of understanding. 

When the MOU on scientific cooperation between the Polish and Mongolian Academies of Sciences was brought forward, Tusk leaned toward Khürelsükh. ""Our paleontologists have a long and fruitful history with the Gobi Desert,"" he remarked. ""Since the 1960s. They brought back dinosaurs."" 

Khürelsükh nodded, a faint smile touching his lips. ""The Gobi does not give up its secrets easily. It is a harsh place. But for us, it is not an empty wasteland. It is a library of our planet's history, and our own.""He spoke of the desert with a reverence that Tusk, a man from a land of green forests and plains, found captivating. 

Next came the agreement between the Mongolian State Conservatory and the Fryderyk Chopin University of Music. Khürelsükh surprised Tusk again. ""Chopin is well-loved in Mongolia,"" he said. ""We have held the international piano competition in Ulaanbaatar four times.""He spoke of the fierce, defiant patriotism in the composer's Polonaises, comparing their spirit to the 

*magtaal*, the heroic praise poems of Mongolian tradition.Tusk, a man who enjoyed Quentin Tarantino films and football but also possessed a deep appreciation for European high culture, was genuinely impressed by the depth of the connection Khürelsükh drew. 

The agreement between their respective defense universities provided another point of contact. Tusk acknowledged Khürelsükh's military past with a respectful nod.""In our part of the world,"" Tusk said, his tone turning more serious, ""a modern, independent defense is not a matter of theory.""  

""It is a matter of survival,"" Khürelsükh finished, his voice resonating with an authority that needed no embellishment. ""A nation must be able to protect itself. That is the first duty.""

With each signature, Tusk felt a layer of diplomatic formality peel away. He was moving past the stoic exterior of the President and getting glimpses of the man himself—a man who thought about deep time, who understood the soul of patriotic music, who carried the weight of his nation's security with an unadorned gravity. In Polish social customs, there was a clear line between the inner circle and [outsiders.It](http://outsiders.It) was a slow process to be invited across that line, a transition marked by a shift from formal titles to first names. Tusk didn't know if he was crossing that line, but he felt, with a certainty that surprised him, that he wanted to. The series of niche, personal agreements had created a unique diplomatic space, a structured way for them to discover shared values that a single, monolithic trade deal never could have revealed.  

# Chapter 4: A Reciprocity of Welcome

The state dinner was held in a hall adorned with portraits of Polish kings and heroes. The air was thick with the scent of beeswax from the candles and the low hum of diplomatic conversation. Tusk, as host, found himself wanting to explain not just the food on the plates, but the meaning behind the rituals.

As the servers brought out the *bigos*, the traditional hunter's stew, Tusk leaned towards Khürelsükh.""There is a custom in Poland,"" he began, ""at our Christmas Eve supper, 

*Wigilia*. We set an extra place at the table, for an unexpected guest, a stranger who might knock on the door.""He explained the tradition of 

*dzielenie opłatkiem*, the breaking of a wafer while exchanging wishes for the year to come, a ritual of profound community.""We believe no one should be alone or turned away on that night.""  

Khürelsükh listened intently, his gaze unwavering. He took a sip of water before responding. ""In my country,"" he said, his voice carrying easily over the clink of silverware, ""a nomad will leave his *ger* unlocked when he is away. Any traveler who passes may enter, rest, and take food from the table. It is our way.""He described the ritual of receiving a bowl of tea or 

*airag* with the right hand, supported at the elbow by the left, a gesture of respect and an acknowledgment of the gift being offered. 

They were two men from worlds apart—one from the dense, Catholic heart of Europe, the other from the vast, shamanistic steppes of Asia. Yet, in their descriptions of hospitality, they found a startlingly similar philosophy: a sacred duty to the guest, a fundamental belief in human connection. For men who lived their lives surrounded by security details and impenetrable protocol, this shared value felt like a discovery of a hidden common language. The hospitality they could truly offer each other was not food or shelter, but these rare moments of unguarded conversation, an invitation into a trusted space.

As the evening drew to a close, the atmosphere between them had shifted from formal respect to genuine warmth. The political calculations seemed to have receded, replaced by a simple, human rapport.

""Prime Minister,"" Khürelsükh said, his tone formal but his eyes holding a different message. ""You have shown me the heart of Poland. But to understand the partnership we have signed today, you must see the heart of Mongolia. I would be honored if you would attend our Naadam festival this summer as my personal guest."" 

The invitation was official, but the sentiment was deeply personal. It was not a summons to another summit, but a call to witness something essential. Tusk, the historian and the pragmatist, the man who felt the weight of his nation's past and the anxieties of its present, felt a pull he could not explain. It was a pull towards the vast, the ancient, the unknown.

""Mr. President,"" Tusk replied, a genuine smile finally breaking through his weary demeanor. ""It would be my honor to accept.""

# Part II: Land of the Eternal Blue Sky

# Chapter 5: An Invitation to the Steppe

The months between the Warsaw summit and the Mongolian summer were bridged by a series of formal, yet increasingly personal, communications. The official letters, drafted by aides and transmitted through diplomatic channels, spoke of finalizing the details of the Prime Minister's visit to Ulaanbaatar ""in the spirit of the Comprehensive Partnership"".But between the lines of diplomatic language, a different kind of correspondence was taking place.  

Tusk, in a handwritten note accompanying a formal acceptance, mentioned his reading of Polish accounts of the Gobi expeditions. He wrote of his anticipation in seeing the ""land of the eternal blue sky,"" a phrase he had learned from Khürelsükh's briefing papers. 

Khürelsükh's reply came with a book of Mongolian photography—images of soaring eagles, windswept grasslands, and the faces of nomadic herders etched with the wisdom of generations. A short, typed message was enclosed: ""The sky is only one part of our story. I look forward to showing you the land it covers, the true heart of Mongolia.""

For Tusk, the impending journey became an anchor in the turbulent sea of his political life. When bogged down in a bitter debate with the opposition over judicial reforms or navigating the delicate egos of his European counterparts, his mind would drift to those images of vast, open space.He was drawn by a curiosity that had morphed into a deeper longing. It was a desire for something elemental and real, a landscape without fences or historical grievances, a stark contrast to the intricate, layered, and often cynical world he inhabited. The invitation was not just to a festival; it was an invitation to a different way of seeing the world, and he found himself counting the days.  

# Chapter 6: The Vastness

The flight to Ulaanbaatar crossed a continent, but the true journey began upon landing. The city itself was a startling juxtaposition—a bustling hub of modern construction and traffic, ringed by sprawling *ger* districts, all of it set down in a landscape of immense, rolling hills. 

Khürelsükh was there on the tarmac to greet him. Eschewing a simple handshake, he initiated the *zolgokh*, the traditional Mongolian greeting of respect.He held his arms out, and Tusk, having been briefed on the custom, placed his own arms underneath, his hands grasping the President's elbows. As the younger man, his gesture signified support for the elder. For a brief moment, their cheeks touched. The gesture was formal yet surprisingly intimate, a physical expression of the bond that had begun to form in Warsaw.  

The next day, they left the city behind. The paved roads quickly gave way to dirt tracks, and then to no tracks at all, their convoy of vehicles forging a path across the open steppe.For Tusk, the experience was a profound sensory and psychological shift. The Polish landscape, with its patchwork of farms, forests, and villages, was a human-scaled, historical terrain.This was something else entirely. The grasslands rolled on to every horizon, an uninterrupted ocean of green under a sky so vast and blue it seemed to press down on the earth. There were no fences, no power lines, no ancient churches or manor houses. It was a landscape that felt pre-historical, a world that existed before the complexities and divisions that had defined Tusk's entire life.  

This sheer scale of the land began to work on him, deconstructing his European frame of reference. The bitter political battles in Warsaw, the intricate negotiations in Brussels—they all seemed to shrink in significance under the immensity of the Mongolian sky. It was as if the landscape itself was stripping away his political armor, forcing a confrontation with something more fundamental within himself. The physical journey into the steppe was mirroring an internal one, creating a space of quiet introspection where the noise of his daily life faded away, leaving him more vulnerable, and more open, than he had been in years. He was no longer just the Prime Minister of Poland on a state visit; he was a man in a vast, wild place, accompanied by the one person who seemed to embody its spirit.

# Chapter 7: The Three Manly Games

The Naadam festival was an explosion of color, sound, and energy. It was not a performance for tourists, Tusk realized, but a raw and vibrant expression of the nation's soul.With Khürelsükh as his guide, he was given a privileged view into the heart of Mongolian culture.  

They stood near the wrestling grounds, the air electric with anticipation. Tusk watched as the wrestlers, clad in their traditional *zodog shuudag* costumes, performed the *devekh*, the eagle dance, before grappling. It was a display of raw power, but also of deep ritual. ""It is not just about strength,"" Khürelsükh explained, his voice cutting through the roar of the crowd. ""It is about honor. The winner helps the loser to his feet. He shows respect. The eagle is the king of the sky. The wrestler aspires to his spirit."" 

Later, they watched the horse racing. Tusk was astounded to see children, some as young as five, acting as jockeys, their small bodies perched atop powerful Mongolian horses for races that stretched for miles across the steppe.""It is a test of the horse,"" Khürelsükh said, his eyes on the distant line of riders. ""Of its spirit and endurance. The child is just there to guide it. We are a nation born on horseback. The horse is our brother."" 

At the archery field, they watched men and women take aim, their focus absolute. Khürelsükh picked up a traditional compound bow, feeling its weight. ""With these,"" he said quietly, ""our ancestors built the largest empire the world has ever seen. It is in our blood. The memory of what is possible."" 

Through these three games, Tusk began to understand the man beside him in a new light. The ""Fist"" persona was not a simple, brutish machismo. It was an expression of a culture that revered strength, endurance, resilience, and a profound connection to its ancestral traditions. He saw Khürelsükh not just as a political leader, but as the living embodiment of his people's heritage, a guardian of the flame that had burned on the steppe for centuries.

# Chapter 8: Fire and Fermented Milk

On the final day of the festival, Khürelsükh took Tusk away from the crowds. They flew by helicopter to Khentii province, the land of Khürelsükh's ancestors, the birthplace of Chinggis Khaan.They landed in a valley cradled by rolling hills, where a single, private 

*ger* stood waiting. There were no aides, no security details in sight, only the vast, silent landscape.

They observed the proper etiquette as they entered the nomadic dwelling. Tusk consciously stepped over the threshold, never on it, and moved to the left, the guest's side.The interior was a marvel of compact functionality. A fire burned in the central stove, its warmth radiating outwards. The space felt sacred, a sanctuary sealed off from the outside world.  

Here, in the intimacy of the *ger*, the last vestiges of their public personas fell away. They were simply Donald and Ukhnaa. They shared a bowl of *airag*, the tangy, fermented mare's milk that was the drink of the steppe, passing it between them. 

""When I was a young man,"" Tusk began, his voice low, ""I worked as a chimney painter. High-altitude work. It was one of the few ways to make a living outside the communist system.""He spoke of the hopelessness of those years, the grey monotony, the feeling that nothing would ever change. 

Khürelsükh listened, his gaze fixed on the flickering flames of the holy fire.""I was a soldier,"" he responded. ""I wore the uniform of the state. But when the government tried to separate the army from the party, I resigned my commission. I could not serve a system I no longer believed in.""He spoke of the protests he had led, of the hunger strikes, of the burning desire for his country to be its own master.  

Their stories, born of different worlds, converged on the same point of defiance and hope. As dusk fell, Khürelsükh retrieved a long, folded piece of silk. It was a *khadag*, the color of the eternal blue sky. 

""In my culture,"" he said, unfolding the scarf, ""this is the highest offering. It is a symbol of respect. Of honor."" He held it out to Tusk with both hands.

Tusk accepted it, the silk cool against his skin. The gesture was more profound than any treaty, more binding than any signed declaration. It was an offering from one man's soul to another.

They stepped outside. The sun had set, and the sky was a deep, star-dusted indigo, more brilliant than Tusk had ever seen. The Milky Way stretched across the heavens like a celestial river. In the immense silence of the steppe, a landscape that felt outside of time and politics, the deep respect and intellectual connection that had grown between them finally found its voice. It was a silent acknowledgment, a meeting of eyes that held a universe of understanding. The Prime Minister of Poland and the President of Mongolia were gone. In their place stood two men who had found in each other an unexpected, undeniable home.

# Part III: Geopolitical Realities

# Chapter 9: The Uncrossable Divide

The return to Warsaw was a jarring reentry into a different reality. The boundless sky of Mongolia was replaced by the familiar, often oppressive, weight of European politics. Tusk was immediately plunged back into the maelstrom: a leaked audio recording from his time as European Council president being weaponized by the PiS-affiliated media, fresh polls showing public dissatisfaction with his government's progress, and another tense summit in Brussels on EU defense strategy.The memory of the 

*ger*, of the shared bowl of *airag*, of the silent understanding under a canopy of stars, felt like a dream from another lifetime.

The brutal reality of their situations settled in. Tusk was a central pillar of the European Union and a key Atlanticist voice in NATO.His entire political identity was interwoven with the West. Khürelsükh, meanwhile, had to continue his nation's delicate geopolitical ballet, balancing the immense gravitational pulls of Russia and China, on whom his country depended for trade and energy.Their worlds were not just different; they were, in many ways, oppositional.  

A public relationship was unthinkable. It would be a political catastrophe for both. Tusk's opponents in Poland would paint it as a bizarre, dangerous dalliance, proof that he was out of touch and unreliable.For Khürelsükh, any perceived alignment that was too close to a major NATO leader could destabilize the fragile neutrality upon which Mongolia's sovereignty depended. 

They were two men at the helms of their respective ships of state, navigating treacherous waters. The new, secret emotional dimension in their lives was a source of profound, private strength, but also of a deep and abiding sadness. Their communications were infrequent, secure, and carefully worded—a digital lifeline across an uncrossable divide, a constant, painful reminder of the distance that separated them.

# Chapter 10: A Shared Horizon

Months later, they found their opportunity. It was on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York, a neutral space of chaotic, overlapping diplomacies. Their meeting was brief, squeezed between a climate panel and a Security Council briefing, a stolen ten minutes in a sterile conference room.

There were no grand declarations, no impossible promises. There was only a quiet, mutual acknowledgment of the world as it was. They looked at each other, and in that shared gaze was an acceptance of the constraints that bound them.

""The Comprehensive Partnership,"" Tusk said, the words feeling both inadequate and perfectly fitting. ""It has been... more comprehensive than I imagined.""

Khürelsükh allowed himself a small, sad smile. ""A third neighbor,"" he said, his voice low. ""Sometimes, that is the most important kind. A place of trust, apart from the others.""

They had found the metaphor for their own relationship. They could never be each other's primary world; their duties to their nations, to Poland and Mongolia, were absolute. But they could be that trusted third space, a private sanctuary of honesty and affection in lives defined by the relentless pressures of their primary obligations.

They parted with a simple handshake, two leaders returning to their separate delegations, their separate worlds. But they carried with them a shared secret, a private alliance of the heart that no treaty could ever capture.

Later that evening, from his hotel room overlooking the East River, Tusk looked out at the horizon. He knew that thousands of miles away, beyond the curve of the earth, Khürelsükh was looking at the same sky, the same distant line where earth meets heaven. They were separated by continents and politics, by culture and alliances, but they were connected by an invisible thread of understanding, a shared horizon that existed only for them. The partnership they had signed in Warsaw had indeed yielded a profound result, just not one that would ever appear in a diplomatic communiqué.",1,1753706563.0,mongolia,1,1.0,False

## Core Benefits

Investing in a 12x15 area rug provides numerous practical and aesthetic benefits.

**Enhanced Room Aesthetics:** An area rug can instantly elevate the style and sophistication of any space. It acts as a focal point and brings unity to the room.

The right rug ties together existing furniture and décor, creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere. By carefully selecting the color,pattern,and texture,you can create the desired mood – whether it's cozy and warm or elegant and refined. A well-chosen rug can also visually enlarge a space or define distinct areas within a larger room. For exmaple, you can clearly define a living area within an open-concept floor plan.

**Increased Comfort and Warmth:** An area rug adds a layer of cushioning and insulation underfoot.

It provides a soft and agreeable surface to walk on, particularly on hard floors like tile or hardwood. Rugs also help to insulate a room, keeping it warmer in the winter and cooler in the summer. This can lead to savings on energy bills and create a more comfortable living environment overall. The warmth provided can turn a cold, lifeless space into a welcoming, cozy area.**Noise Reduction:** Carpets and rugs absorb sound, reducing echoes and dampening noise levels.

This is particularly beneficial in apartments or homes with hardwood floors, where sound can easily travel. A 12x15 area rug effectively minimizes noise from footsteps, conversations, and other activities. This creates a quieter and more peaceful living environment, enhancing both comfort and privacy. Families with children or pets generally gain a great deal of benefit.**Floor Protection:** Area rugs protect your flooring from scratches, wear, and tear.

This is a cost-effective way to preserve the value and beauty of your flooring,especially in areas prone to spills or heavy foot traffic. Properly maintained rugs help to extend the life of your floor coverings.

**What is the best material for a 12x15 area rug in a high-traffic area?**
For high-traffic zones, synthetic materials such as polypropylene or polyester are excellent choices due to their durability and resistance to stains and wear and tear. These materials are also easy to clean and maintain, making them practical for busy households. Wool is another decent option but generally requires more specialized cleaning.

**How do I choose the right rug pattern for my room?**
consider the existing décor and color palette of your room.If your furniture is neutral, you can opt for a rug with a bolder pattern or vibrant colors to create a focal point. If your furniture is already patterned, choose a rug with a more subtle or complementary design. The scale of the pattern should also be proportional to the size of your room.

**How do I clean a 12x15 area rug?**
Cleaning methods vary depending on the material of your rug. Vacuuming regularly is essential to remove dirt and debris.For spills, blot immediately with a clean cloth. Professional cleaning is recommended for wool and other delicate materials. Always check the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning guidelines.

**Can I use a rug pad with a 12x15 area rug?**
Yes, a rug pad is highly recommended. It provides cushioning, prevents the rug from slipping, and protects your flooring from scratches. Choose a rug pad that is specifically designed for the type of flooring you have. Rug pads also extend the life of your rug by providing support and preventing premature wear.

1mbf0qm,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1mbf0qm/does_the_delonghi_dedica_arte_deliver/,Does the De'Longhi Dedica Arte Deliver Barista-Quality Espresso at Home?,"When I first got my hands on the De'Longhi EC885M, I was immediately struck by its sleek and compact design. As someone who values well-thought-out aesthetics in kitchen appliances, this espresso machine felt like it was crafted with both functionality and style in mind. Measuring just 6 inches wide, it doesn’t dominate the counter, which is great news for anyone dealing with limited kitchen space. The stainless steel finish adds a premium touch, making it feel like it belongs in a trendy café.

**Good Points**

- The 15-bar professional pressure ensures café-quality results with customizable controls.
- Its My LatteArt steam wand simplifies creating velvety milk textures.
- Compact design with stainless steel finish looks modern and reduces counter space clutter.
- The adjustable drip tray accommodates taller cups effortlessly.
- The removable, transparent 35-ounce water tank is easy to refill and eliminates guesswork.

Using the De'Longhi EC885M daily feels like stepping into the shoes of a barista. The My LatteArt steam wand is genuinely impressive. I tested my latte-making skills, and it not only makes silky microfoam but inspires creativity for latte art. Whether you're in the mood for a silky latte or a frothy cappuccino, the wand delivers consistently excellent results. At first, I was hesitant about how much control the machine would give me, but surprisingly, it's a perfect mix of automation and manual finesse. Features like the Automatic Flow Stop take out the second-guessing when brewing your espresso shots; they come out perfectly every time. 

[View De'Longhi EC885M sale info on Amazon.](https://ultrasonicstore.com/p/b09hlb4dp4/)

The professional tamper and generously sized filter basket are highlights. This machine can handle up to 18 grams of ground coffee, making it feel like I can finally ditch my costly café trips. With each brew, the aroma and intensity of the coffee remind me of my earlier days in Italy, where espresso-making was an art. The adjustable double drip tray is another thoughtful touch, accommodating everything from traditional espresso cups to my taller latte glasses with ease.

One thing I particularly loved was how easy the water tank is to manage. The 35-ounce capacity meant I didn’t need to refill it after every use, and being able to see the water level at a glance was incredibly convenient. However, considering the small overall size of the machine, I sometimes wished it held just a little more water—especially on days I wanted to serve several guests.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The machine is noisier compared to some competing espresso makers.
- May require a slight learning curve for first-timers using a steam wand.
- The 35-ounce water tank could feel slightly small for frequent use.

There’s also a bit of a learning curve to mastering its functionality. For someone new to espresso machines, perfecting the ideal milk texture or adjusting to the correct grounds level might take a few tries. The machine’s hum, though not overwhelmingly loud, can still be noticeable, particularly during early mornings when I’m trying to sneak in that first shot of coffee while the house is quiet.

**Product Contenders**

When comparing this model to other popular options, there are some clear distinctions. For instance, compared to entry-level machines like the Breville Bambino Plus, the De'Longhi EC885M has a more manual-focused approach, which I appreciated for the control it allowed. On the other hand, fully automated models like the Philips 3200 LatteGo offer unparalleled convenience but lack the artistic and hands-on satisfaction this machine brings. If style and compactness weren't a factor, it might struggle to stand out against larger all-in-one coffee makers.

If you’re after a commercial-grade espresso machine experience in the comfort of your own home, this product outperforms alternatives like the Gaggia Classic Pro, primarily because of its user-friendly features and modern design. The My LatteArt steam wand, paired with the Automatic Flow Stop, strikes a balance between fine-tuned customization and ease of use, which I felt was a standout advantage over many similarly priced machines.

**Quality for Price**

From a value perspective, this machine justifies its price tag for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy hands-on brewing without committing to a fully manual setup. Some other models on the market might be slightly cheaper, but they don’t provide the same premium build quality, compact dimensions, or blend of manual and automated features. The thoughtful design reduces guesswork while still letting you savor the art of coffee making. If you view espresso making as an experience, it’s worth the investment.

Hello, world! I’m Lorithar, a Protection Paladin on Kazzak-EU, and by day (and let’s face it, many late nights) I’m tanking mid to high-end Mythic+ dungeons - over 3100 Mythic+ rating in The War Within Season Two so far. For context, that puts me above the Keystone Legend threshold of 3000 rating - not quite in the top 0.1% ""Enterprising Hero"" club, but close enough to smell the ozone from their auras. I’ve also dabbled in PvP on the side, enough to appreciate the adrenaline of arenas (and to have my pride handed to me by spry Rogues and Priests more times than I’d like to admit).

Why mention both? Because this is a forever ongoing debate in the WoW community that I find myself drawn into often: Which is tougher, high-end PvE or high-end PvP? In other words, is timing a Mythic+22 key ""harder"" or ""easier"" than climbing above, say, 2400 rating in 3v3 arenas? As someone who’s taken plenty of beatings from raid bosses and players, I figure I’d share my personal take. **Don’t worry, this won’t be a ""PvE master race"" rant or a ""PvP git gud"" sermon**. Instead, I want to talk about the **different flavors of difficulty in Mythic+ versus PvP**, with a dash of humor and a dose of real-talk from a tank who’s seen both sides.

*(Credentials established? Check. Coffee in hand? Check. Let’s dive in, it's gonna be a long one!)*

# Achievement tiers and what 3100 rating means

Before we get into the meaty bits, let’s set the stage with some quick facts. Mythic+ (M+) uses a rating system each season, and The War Within Season Two has a few milestone achievements that Mythic+ players chase:

* Keystone Conqueror (**1500 rating**) - A mid-tier feat that grants the title ""the Enterprising"" . (Yes, you become enterprising at 1500, hold that thought for later irony.)
* Keystone Master (**2000 ratin**g) - A major benchmark that rewards a shiny mount (the Crimson Shreddertank spider-tank!) . This is the seasonal ""KSM"" many players gun for.
* Keystone Hero (**2500 rating**) - A step beyond Master . No mount here, but considerable bragging rights (and it contributes to a meta achievement for additional rewards ).
* Keystone Legend (**3000 rating**) - New in Season Two, indicating you’ve truly conquered M+; rewards the Enterprising Shreddertank mount (a recolor of the 2k mount) . Hitting this is a big deal – it means you’ve likely timed all the season’s dungeons at pretty high levels.
* Enterprising Hero (**Top 0.1%**) - A feat of strength for ending the season in the top 0.1% of all Mythic+ ratings . This one awards the exclusive title **the Enterprising Hero** to wear with pride (and probably a touch of smugness) . Only the elite of the elite will have this by season’s end.

So when I say I’m sitting at 3100+ rating, that means I’ve cleared well above the usual ""endgame"" level for Mythic+, pushing into territory where every dungeon run feels like a tightrope walk. It’s given me a solid perspective on what high-end PvE demands, and it’s made me appreciate the brutal pace and unpredictability of PvP, both firsthand and through relentless feedback from my PvP-heavy friend group. **Now, let’s talk difficulty: PvE vs PvP.**

# PvE vs PvP - predictable scripts vs player mind games

One argument I hear a lot: ""Mythic+ is scripted; PvP is dynamic. Obviously PvP is harder!"" It’s true that PvE encounters are pre-designed. Dungeon bosses and trash mobs don’t improvise, they have abilities that fire in set patterns or triggers. In Mythic+ you can study these patterns, watch a YouTube guide, install a boss mod, and pretty much know exactly when, say, Boss X will unleash that killer AoE or when the next wave of mobs will spawn. The predictability means you can come prepared with a game plan. As one fellow player succinctly put it, ""PvE is mostly predictable… PvP is more reactionary"" . I can literally plan my Divine Shield usage for a dungeon boss well in advance; in an arena match, however, I’m reacting to humans doing human things - like suddenly swapping targets or pulling off an unexpected crowd control chain.

That unpredictability in PvP is no joke. Players adapt; they learn your tendencies, fake you out, and generally refuse to behave like scripted NPCs. No addon can tell me with certainty

>xxWarrior\_Killer69xx is about to Fear you in 3…2…1…

the way DBM or WeakAura can for a boss mechanic. This means in PvP, your perception and quick reads are constantly tested. PvE rewards planning; PvP rewards adaptation.

However - *and this is where the discussion gets spicy* \- predictability does not equal easiness. High M+ keys are brutally difficult in their own way, even though you ""know"" what’s coming. It’s a bit like knowing all the notes to a Beethoven sonata; performing it live, flawlessly, under pressure is another matter entirely. In M+, the difficulty is dialed up by raw numbers - mobs hit harder, timers are tighter - to the point that execution has to be nearly perfect. In fact, M+ has an infinitely scaling difficulty curve. You can keep raising the key level until eventually the dungeon becomes mathematically impossible to beat. Mythic+ can scale to the point of near-certain failure - +40s are basically impossible. In PvP, there’s always a sliver of a chance, even against top players. That’s the nature of human unpredictability.

So is that kind of ""impossible if cranked high enough"" difficulty harder or not? It depends on your definition. **Personally, I find that PvE and PvP test different skill sets**. In PvE (especially M+), success comes from planning, strategy, and execution of a known script under intense pressure. In PvP, success is more about adaptability, quick decision-making, mind games and outplaying an opponent who’s trying to do the same to you. One is a marathon dance routine, the other is a spontaneous duel. They’re both hard, but hard in different ways.

# Group coordination and mental load

Let’s talk teamwork and the joy of ""herding cats"". In Mythic+, group coordination makes or breaks you. As a tank, I'm usually the one calling pulls and hoping the DPS remember how to interrupt or dodge fire. One missed kick or sleepy healer can turn 30 minutes of precision into instant regret - key bricked, run over, heart broken. Arena is similar - smaller scale, but just as demanding in coordination, with less margin for error.

There's also the fun blame game. In Mythic+, the tank blames the healer, the healer blames the tank, and everyone blames the DPS. In arena, blame often turns into collective sighs and shared facepalms, since you typically play with consistent partners. Either way, failing hurts, though at least arenas end quickly, whereas a failed high key means waving goodbye to half an hour of your life.

Finally, mental stress differs greatly. Mythic+ stress is a 30 minute endurance test where one mistake ruins everything. PvP is all spikes and split-second calls. I’ve sweated through both - neither is for the faint hearted.

# Tools of the trade: addons and ""Easy Mode"" myths

Let's talk about addons for a moment, the elephant in the Mythic+ room. A common criticism of PvE content is that it’s somehow ""easy mode"" because tools like Deadly Boss Mods and WeakAuras shout every mechanic at you (""Run away, little girl!"", you've probably heard it a thousand times). And you know what? Those addons absolutely make the game easier. In fact, they've become so powerful and widespread that Blizzard has had to design encounters to be increasingly complex just to challenge players who rely on them.

Personally, though, I've mostly [tanked my keys](https://youtu.be/L3J1qQETCM8?si=N784z2bwVvyvd6ZY) without using these addons \**cough\*plater\*cough\**. It's not some hipster badge of honor (okay, maybe a little), but I've found that playing without a screen cluttered by warnings and timers actually helps me focus better. Without addons, every pull feels like reading the battlefield in real-time; tracking casts, positioning, and mechanics through pure game sense rather than a flashing alert. It might sound crazy at 3100+ Mythic rating, but it works for me.

*(Feel free to check out my low addon UI video -* [*here*](https://youtu.be/2u8vZ7tdYKk?si=NgTMQ3pwD3-sat0q)*, totally not a shameless plug tee-hee)*

PvP players use plenty of addons too: cooldown trackers, DR timers, arena frames; but they don’t predict behavior. PvE mods, on the other hand, broadcast scripted mechanics, which inflates encounter design around them.

But here's the core problem: as PvE addons become more sophisticated, Blizzard must design increasingly punishing mechanics to challenge players who use them. It's an arms race, UI complexity versus encounter complexity, and the game suffers for it. Players who don't use these tools face an uphill battle, while those who do may find the game cluttered, stressful, and overloaded with information.

Does that mean addons eliminate skill entirely? No. But their existence undeniably shapes WoW's design and raises the bar of difficulty artificially ( to be changed soon! ). My stance is simple: if an addon becomes mandatory, the game's design, not the player, is at fault. After all, if addons really could play the game for you, I'd be sipping drinks on a beach in Gadgetzan, selling ""Lorithar’s Automated Tanking Service"" instead of doing keys.

In the end, real skill - PvE or PvP - is about your ability to read situations, react quickly, and execute under pressure. Addons or not, the best players still shine through.

# Why the comparison isn't the whole story

So why argue about PvE vs PvP difficulty at all? Honestly, it usually boils down to pride and a bit of insecurity. WoW offers multiple endgames, some players focus on Mythic raids or pushing keys, others dedicate themselves to arena rankings. Everyone wants their chosen path to be recognized, which often leads to downplaying the other side.

The truth is, these comparisons miss the point. Skill in WoW isn't one-dimensional. Ultimately, both forms of content are optional, challenging, and meant to be enjoyable. WoW thrives because it supports multiple playstyles, each community enriching the game differently (and occasionally driving developers crazy... sorry, Ion!).

# Two paths to glory (let’s not gatekeep fun)

At the end of the day, comparing high-end Mythic+ and PvP doesn't lead anywhere productive. Both are challenging, require deep skill, dedication, and can give you a genuine thrill when you succeed.

As a Mythic+ tank who's pushed beyond ""a casual player"" rating, I'll say this clearly: PvE is absolutely skill intensive. Coordinating pulls, timing interrupts, managing cooldowns, and reacting perfectly under intense pressure, it's competitive gameplay at its finest.

Yet, I have huge respect for PvP players too. Trying arenas made me appreciate their skill, adaptability, and quick thinking even more.

**World of Warcraft is richer for having both PvE and PvP. Instead of debating ""which is harder,"" let's just acknowledge and respect the effort and skill required in both paths, and remember to have fun along the way.**

What is your take on the subject?

Hope that’s ok.

\- We drove from Pittsburgh to Cincy Friday straight to our Air BnB in the Northside. Cleaned up, changed and then headed to the Hi-Mark on our way to Riverbend for a concert. We found Hi-Mark on our last weekend trip to Cincy about 6 years ago and really loved the food and vibe and we’re excited to get back. Food was great! Beer choices were unfortunately meh, but the disappointing part was the service. We got there about 3:00 and there were literally 4 other people in there. Bartender didn’t address us and was all in all attitude-y and nonexistent. Kind of ruined it for us. Oh well.

\- We parked in the very first lot at Riverbend. It was hotter than hell in Riverbend, luckily we had seats under the pavilion section. Concert rocked. Hot as hell and sweaty all night. We actually got out of the lot pretty quickly which was good.

\- Saturday we walked to the Blue Jay in Northside for breakfast. Great vibes, GREAT service. French toast was fine. Coffee was diner great, goetta was sooo good and the Blue Jay Special was very, very tasty. Great spot.

\- Went next door to Shake It Records and WOW what a fucking gem! One of the best record shops I’ve been to on my travels. HAD lots of stuff on my list, ended up with a Manchester Orchestra album and a t-shirt for me, hoodie for my partner. Seriously amazing record store!

\- American Sign Museum next, which remains my favorite museum / cultural institution anywhere. It’s my jam and I love it! The expansion is ridiculously well done and the curation is A+. We timed it right and did the tour at Noon which was impressive and Gabby, the tour guide, was wonderful!

\- Swung my Union Terminal to check it out – super cool, and we continue to be struck by what a fantastic way to continue the life of the building and repurpose it.

\- Drove to Clifton to hit up Skyline and Graeter’s. Coney was delicious. Graeter’s is always good!

\- Back to Northside to hit up Urban Artifact. Good beers, board games, vibes.

\- Northside Yacht Club for dinner. No AC so hot as fuck in there, but so, so, so worth it. I can honestly say the wings (we got Parmesan Garlic) were some of the best food items we’ve had. I feel like referring to them as simply “wings” undersells how fucking delicious they were. I’d drive back to Cincy just for those damn wings. Tofu wrap was killer too, great fries and our server gave us a free PB Tequila shot, which was surprisingly unreal good. Tried buying a Medium t-shirt, but alas they did not have that size :( If they restock and someone wants to send me a Medium t shirt I’d venmo you the money, haha!

\- Sunday was a trip to Findlay Market on our way out of town. Grabbed some goetta to go at Eckerlin and some breakfast sammies too which were delicious – hot mett and of course goetta breakfast sammies. Really liked the mett, which we don’t have in Pittsburgh. Was like a cross between a hot dog and kielbasa. Got some other stuff. Also paid $8 for a small as waffle at the Belgium place. Yummy waffle, but $8 is ridiculous.

LOVED the trip. Had to adjust bc of the stifling weather. We planned on Goettafest but it was just too damn oppressive outside. Super excited to go to Northside Yacht Club. We planned on going back to Hi-Mark, but the disappointing service on Friday, swayed us to stay closer and hit up Yacht Club. What a decision that was!

Thanks to everyone for the recs! We’re excited to get back to Cincy again and explore more neighborhoods / areas! This time sooner than 6 years. Cheers!",64,1753705323.0,cincinnati,10,0.92,False

TL:DR Flatmates has been making me pay council tax even though I'm a student so that she can still afford nice things and splash out for herself despite making me financially worse off 

Hey everyone some context.

Ive (21M) been living with my flatmate (22F) since September. I am a student  ( graduated last week) who works part time (18hrs) and she works full time (30hrs) and before we moved in I agreed to help with council tax as she told me she was on minimum wage and wouldn't be able to pay council tax fully by herself. She sorts out all the council tax as I sort out rent, bills and I felt it was fair if she had a responsibility. However after an incident on my birthday I feel like she's been purposely taking advantage of me and I'm not sure what to do 

I first sent her £130 in January to go towards our payment of £300 and she had told me she'll pay a an extra £40 to be 'nice' ( I've since found out the first payment was £260 so she didn't pay any extra just told me she had to look like she'd done me a favour ). She also told me after I sent the money that this was the only thing we had to pay. 3 months later we move house and once we move in informs me we still have to pay an extra £324 ( £162 each )for the previous house, she said she knew there was more to pay but thought she'd already 'sorted it out and it'd be fine'. I was obviously a bit shocked and annoyed but said I could find the money and make it work, I also spoke to her about being more communicative with me about these things because it's annoying to find out you have a large sum of money to pay out of the blue while the other person has had months to prepare and save. She also has tendency to tell me important information at the very last minute, for example she said she'd look for movers as I was busy with exams and then 2 days before we are due to move I ask her how much it is for the van and if she's found one to which she tells me 'no can you help look, I've been looking G' leading me to have to sort it out ( the same thing happened with the cleaners ). I told her again to communicate more about these things and that her procrastination about house tasks affects me because I have to deal with exams,work, packing and now on too of that looking for these services last minute. In this conversation I told her I'd rather not help her with every task she does but if she can't do it herself let me know so I can either help or sort it out myself.

I ask her repeatedly the next 4 months when I need to send her money for the council tax from the last house and how much council tax is for new house as that way I can know how much to save,  if I need to pick up any extra shifts and if I should even look at getting another job. She kept on telling me that she'd let me know and it's not that much and our security deposit return from the old house should cover it all anyway. Anytime I ask she is dodgy but I don't say anything because I had more important things like work and my dissertation to deal with and couldn't handle this other stress on top of it all.

4 months have passed and it's my birthday and go for a drink with my flatmate, during the day she had got me a card calling me the best flatmate ever and praising me for this stuff etc. At the pub I tell her that I have a lot less shifts this August as because I work with young people as a support worker during the summer holidays I naturally have less shifts, and I say while it's annoying from a financial perspective it's okay because I have enough for August's rent and saved a good amount ( roughly £550 ) and it means I can go visit my family in Italy and spend time with friends something I've been postponing for many reasons. She choses this moment to tell me that we still owe money from the old house and it's now increased ( an extra £50 each) because we missed the payment; I also have to transfer her £800 to pay for this flats council tax as we aren't able to pay monthly because she missed the first 3 payments so now has to pay it all upfront. It doesn't end there though, she also tells me that I'll have to owe her £50 every month for the next 9 months to pay off the rest of the council tax. 

Some other important context is that I'm autistic, people with autism can be more vulnerable to exploitation and manipulatiaion as they ( at least for me personally ) struggle understanding social nuisances or rules particular when the behaviour of others could be considered concerning I also have difficulty understanding my needs and how something is making me feel and translating it in a way others can understand. I'm also naturally trusting ( borderline naive ) and eager to help out and go the extra way which while I find a good trait especially for my work has made it easier for others to use me for something and leaving me feeling weird without being fully aware of it.

I couldn't tell you what was actually said after that conversation at the pub but I think vaguely I brushed off the conversation as it wasn't something I wanted to discuss on my birthday and she also started crying when telling me this and I didn't want to comfort someone on my birthday especially after all they got me for my birthday was debt. Since that conversation last Wednesday I've been doing some digging because it all didn't add up. Here are the main things that I discovered that really make me feel like I've been taken advantage off.

1. When I first sent her the £130 she didn't use all of it for council tax but rather kept some for herself
2. She had been on universal credit for 3 months during our time living together, she was recieving extra money to specifcally help with living costs and stopped receiving it because she failed to meet the conditions of the Claimant Commitment
3. She was not earning minimum wage but rather £2 above ( which still isn't a lot but does make a difference especially when you've convinced someone to help you out on the basis you earn minimum wage)
4. I do all the cleaning and maintenance of the flat and acquired all the furniture
5. She's been very stingy with me in the past saying things like if your friends come down and use any coffee, oil, toilet paper( communal kitchen items that we take in turns buying ) she won't buy the next lot of these items as I used them more. Which seemed fair until the same standard wasn't applied to her.
5 1/2. She threw away all my posters when we moved and didn't buy anyback because it's unfair to make her pay for something that's an accident.
6. A mutual friend told me she spends £300 in a day once a month as a treat yourself occasion and on top of that sounds £60 on every night out ( roughly 3 times a week). For context after essentials (rent,bills,therapy) I have around £300 as my disposable income.
7. Had told her a couple weeks before my birthday that I'd have to go to therapy less as it was getting to expensive
8. Our old landlord sent us money for repairs that she kept to herself and didn't tell me until after we moved out.
9. We've been friends for 4 years now and the first present I ever got from her was this year and it was her telling me I'll be in debt to her.
10. Despite her earning more and working more and me being part time and a student she wanted to split council tax 50/50 as she felt it was more fair to split every house cost equally.

So what do I do? Do I refuse to pay council tax, move our after my tenancy, work it through, don't do anything? It seems wrong that I've been financially worse off this whole year just so that she could be financially better off

Any advice is appreciated thank you",6,1753705078.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,1.0,False
