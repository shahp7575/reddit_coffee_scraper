I haven‚Äôt been able to afford a decent grinder so I‚Äôve been getting the local roaster to grind in small batches. 

I‚Äôm trying to dial in as best I can to get a cup that I enjoy but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm getting enough espresso out of each ‚Äúpull‚Äù. The machine is not struggling and coffee seems to flow evenly from both holes in the portafilter.

I‚Äôve been measuring 16-18g per shot, but it seems like the volume is much less than a 2oz double shot? Should I adjust the machine to run longer for more volume or would I just end up with a watery cup?",1,1748228867.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

1kvjxlg,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewAuthor/comments/1kvjxlg/chapter_1_reimagined_debut/,Chapter 1 - Reimagined Debut,"Rewrote chapter 1 from distant to limited 3rd pov.

The city always looked sick from the hills. From this distance, the skyscrapers didn't gleam‚Äîthey loomed, jagged silhouettes clawing at the clouds. Below them, the foundries pumped out their filth in steady gray columns, the smoke dragging over rooftops like a blanket no one asked for. You could almost taste it, even here. Acrid. Industrial.
James Harper stood at the window, eyes narrowing toward Foundry Hills. The bathroom window overlooked the curve of the cul-de-sac and the city beyond. The people down there always seemed to be rushing somewhere, heads low, shoulders hunched, like the buildings they moved between. No one looked at each other. They just moved. Fast, loud, mean.
He wondered what kind of life that was. What it did to a person. What it would have done to his kids.
A low growl of thunder rumbled in from the northwest. Rain picking up on the glass.
Then the lights went out.
‚ÄúHarp?‚Äù Denise‚Äôs voice came from the kitchen. Calm, but not calm enough.
The power snapped back a second later. He exhaled. Not the first time this week.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. Another brownout.‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù she answered. He heard a cupboard door close.
He stayed at the window for another breath or two, watching the storm crawl across the sky.
At least it was brief this time, he thought.
Harper wiped the lenses of his glasses, bringing the world back into clarity. His reflection looked back at him from the bathroom mirror‚Äîblue eyes, slightly shadowed from too many late nights, but clear. Denise always said they reminded her of sea glass. He never saw it, but he liked that she did.
Rain continued to hammer the window behind him. He reached into the pocket of his hoodie and pulled out a small box, wrapped in dark paper and tied with thin gold ribbon. The tag‚ÄîFor my love‚Äîshined in cursive script. He turned it in his hand, knowing every piece of cushioned metal within.
The necklace was simple. Just a gold chain. It was the stone that mattered‚Äîan emerald pendant, deep green. It reminded him of her eyes. Not in a vague, romantic way, but specifically: the shade they held in low light, when the morning hadn‚Äôt fully arrived, and she was still half-asleep beside him. He‚Äôd woken to them every day for ten years. Looked into them that first afternoon they met and never really looked away.
But this was only a gem. However much it cost, it couldn‚Äôt compare. It had color, but not her warmth. Shine, but no life.
Today was the day. The anniversary of when they first met.
The thought of her opening it tugged something loose in him‚Äînerves, excitement, the kind of restless energy he never fully knew what to do with. He hated holding onto gifts. It always felt like keeping a secret too long. Still, he slipped the box back into his pocket. A few more hours wouldn‚Äôt matter.
He stepped out into the narrow hallway that stretched the length of the house. It connected the rest of it, bedrooms, bathroom and kitchen. Most of the lights in the house were off, except the one coming from the kitchen and living area at the far end.
Suddenly, another flash of lightning, illuminating the hallway in white, in sync with the thunder. The power stayed on, the brownout average of one a storm remained true.
He pulled the curtain aside‚Äîthe one facing the side of the house. Outside, the creek between his and the neighbor‚Äôs yard had swollen past its banks, spilling into the garden beds. Mud churned through the mulch like wet paint. The neighbor would complain about it in the morning.
Technically, the creek belonged to the city, but that never stopped beer-belly-next-door from acting like it was Harper‚Äôs fault. Beerbelly found any reason to pick fights. Last week it was the dog across the street‚Äîthe one that barked at six in the morning. Harper was up early too, heard the man shouting at the poor woman. All over a dog being a dog, probably just chasing squirrels.
Beerbelly had racked up more than a few complaints with the HOA. Harper knew‚Äîhe‚Äôd filed one himself after the man stabbed Jr‚Äôs basketball with a hunting knife. A toxic presence, but the only one from the cul-de-sac. Still better than what the city had.
He frowned, eyes narrowing behind the glass. Rain rarely hit this hard. Maybe the Foundry‚Äôs plumes had something to do with it‚Äîall that runoff, ash, and heavy metal dust drifting through the air. The plant still melted and cast metal, and they said they‚Äôd upgraded their pollution controls. But he‚Äôd seen the faded sign on his way to work‚Äîthe one by a side entrance‚Äîdated back to the late 1970s. They didn‚Äôt just update the front end and leave the insides to rot, did they? The ones that made people sick‚Äîcancer, lung problems, the kind of damage you don‚Äôt see until it‚Äôs too late.
Alice and James Jr. looked up when Harper walked into the living room and dropped onto the couch. Cards were clenched tightly in their hands, while scattered pairs and triples lay spread between them. He recognized the game‚ÄîRummy. Their grandmother had taught him first, then passed it on to them.
As siblings, they usually had each other‚Äôs backs. But when it came to Rummy, Monopoly‚ÄîGod help them with Uno‚Äîthey were ruthless.
They were good kids. Together, they had something Harper never did. Being an only child had its perks, sure‚Äîbut he‚Äôd have traded them all for a sibling. Maybe then Foundry Hills wouldn‚Äôt feel so hollow.
‚ÄúMmm, you smell that, Jr.?‚Äù Alice asked.
Jr. nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúYup. How about you, Dad?‚Äù
‚ÄúHow could I not?‚Äù
The aroma of Denise‚Äôs beef stew‚Äîher family recipe‚Äîseeped into every corner of the house.
Harper leaned forward and grinned. ‚ÄúYou know, Mom‚Äôs stew is an old recipe passed down through generations. So old, even Thor ate it.‚Äù
Jr. squinted, skeptical. ‚ÄúThor? You‚Äôre lying‚Ä¶ right?‚Äù
Harper just smiled.
He heard the soft clink of the pot lid, then footsteps as Denise walked into the living room, a bowl of popcorn in hand, setting down on the coffee table beside a laptop.
‚ÄúMom, is it true? Did Thor really eat that stew?‚Äù
She smiled down at them. ‚ÄúWell, I don‚Äôt know about that, but it is an old recipe.‚Äù
‚ÄúThen when it‚Äôs ready, I‚Äôll have two plates, please.‚Äù
Alice rolled her eyes in big-sister fashion but couldn‚Äôt hide her smile, drawing another card as the game carried on between them.
Harper grabbed a handful of popcorn from the coffee table. The stew still had a couple hours to go‚Äîa few popped kernels wouldn‚Äôt ruin his appetite.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do without your cooking,‚Äù he said, crunching softly.
He did his fair share of cooking, but Denise‚Äôs meals were something else. Hers had carried memories. They told stories while his only filled their stomachs.
Denise set down the bowl and rested her ringed hand on his. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be missing me and all the flavor I bring to your life,‚Äù she said, a smile curling at the corners.
He looked at her, really looked. ‚ÄúI love you, Denise.‚Äù
‚ÄúI love you, Harp.‚Äù
Beethoven‚Äôs Moonlight Sonata curled from the Bluetooth speaker perched on the fireplace mantel‚Äîone of Denise‚Äôs classical favorites. Above it hung the photo from Rolling Peaks. The four of them weren‚Äôt posed in the usual way. No stiff shoulders or forced grins. They were mid-laugh, looking at each other instead of the camera, caught in some shared joke. Behind them, red peonies, like something from a set‚Äîtoo perfect. Harper‚Äôs eyes lingered on the image. It was the last photo they ever took together.
Denise rested her head against Harper‚Äôs chest, her red curls brushing his bare chin. He breathed in slow, catching the soft, floral trace of her hair‚Äîlavender with something like citrus underneath.
Harper‚Äôs gaze drifted to the fireplace, where flames swayed and split, shadows doing a slow tango along the walls where the artificial light didn‚Äôt reach. He shut his eyes. A rare quiet had settled over him. It lasted only a second.
A sharp crack‚Äîlike something breaking open‚Äîsnapped Harper‚Äôs eyes open.
Behind him, the front lock burst in a spray of splinters. Then another blast. The door buckled and flew inward with a heavy groan.
A figure in black stormed through, face masked, rifle raised, charging straight toward him and his family.
Two more gunmen rushed in behind the first, closing in from the left and right. Harper shot up from the couch, heart pounding. He pivoted sharply as one of the intruders rounded the corner, weapon raised.
The pistol cracked against his temple, sending him staggering. A jagged burst of pain lit up his skull. He stumbled into the coffee table, his hand falling on the bowl of popcorn sending it flying and dropped to his knees. His vision blurred, the edges fraying, the intruders‚Äô voices slipping into sounds he couldn‚Äôt shape into words.
Then ‚Äî a scream. Denise.
He had to get up. Now.
He pushed himself up, blinking against the haze clouding his left eye. Something warm trickled from above his brow. His one clear eye stayed locked on the gunmen. Surrounded, outnumbered. He held back, chest tight, gauging.
‚ÄúWhat do you want? Money?‚Äù His voice came out rougher than he meant.
‚ÄúMoney?‚Äù The woman let out a soft scoff. ‚ÄúPlease. You couldn‚Äôt afford anything close to my worth. We‚Äôre simply fulfilling a request.‚Äù She stood slightly apart, her voice calm, controlled ‚Äî in charge.
Harper‚Äôs fists curled tighter as he tracked her movements.
Her gaze landed on the photo on the end table. She picked it up, gloved fingers brushing the glass.
‚ÄúA shame‚Ä¶ such a beautiful family‚Ä¶‚Äù she said.
Harper guided Denise and the children behind him, drawing them close, shielding them as best he could. Jr. whimpered softly, clinging to his sister‚Äôs arm. The coffee table and sofa were all that stood between them and the masked intruders, guns lowered but ready.
‚ÄúThen what do you want?‚Äù Harper‚Äôs voice came tight, strained.
The woman‚Äôs gaze flicked to Denise, then down to the kids huddled behind her. She let out a quiet sigh, set the photo back on the table, and turned, locking eyes with Harper ‚Äî cold and unblinking.
‚ÄúKill the Harpers.‚Äù
Harper‚Äôs gaze darted to the coffee table. His hand shot out, grabbing the laptop, swinging it hard. The smack echoed as it slammed across the nearest intruder‚Äôs face, sending them to the floor. They didn‚Äôt move.
Another intruder advanced, weapon in hand but not yet raised. Before the barrel could lift, Harper ducked low, lunging forward, grabbing the gunman‚Äôs arm, wrestling to keep it pointed away from Denise and the kids, who had shifted into the corner. The intruder shoved back, slamming Harper‚Äôs shoulders into the mantel above the fireplace. A set of tools clattered to the ground as a sharp groan escaped Harper‚Äôs throat ‚Äî the heat at his back seared through his clothes, hot enough to feel like they were fusing to his skin.
The gunman jerked to break free, but Harper twisted his wrist sharply, locking him into a tight hold. He forced the man‚Äôs arm upward and outward, angling it where the weapon couldn‚Äôt find a target. A round fired off, missing wide, thudding into the carpet near the coffee table.
A second gunshot cracked the air ‚Äî the framed photo above the mantel shattered, glass splintering outward, fragments slicing past Harper‚Äôs cheek.
His head snapped toward the woman, her gun raised, barrel still smoking, eyes locked on him.
Denise surged forward, shoving the woman‚Äôs arm down, nails raking across her skin, catching at the edge of her eye. The woman didn‚Äôt flinch ‚Äî her elbow snapped forward, driving the butt of the gun hard into the side of Denise‚Äôs head.
Denise staggered back with a sharp cry, clutching at her skull. Before she could recover, the woman lunged, grabbed a fistful of Denise‚Äôs red hair, and yanked her back, the cold barrel of the gun pressing firm against her temple.
‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù the woman barked, her voice cutting through the room, freezing everything in place. She brushed a gloved hand across the corner of her mask, where a thin smear of blood marked the spot near her eye.
‚ÄúFeisty,‚Äù she muttered, pressing the barrel harder against Denise‚Äôs temple. ‚ÄúPity it won‚Äôt save you ‚Äî or them.‚Äù
Harper‚Äôs muscles coiled tight, but he forced himself to stay still. Too far to reach her. Any sudden move, and Denise was dead ‚Äî the kids too. His hands shook faintly, the fury simmering under his skin, barely contained.
‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt do this. I‚Äôll do whatever you want. Just don‚Äôt hurt my family,‚Äù Harper said, voice raw.
The woman‚Äôs gaze flicked to the assailant beside him. ‚ÄúI think we‚Äôve made our purpose clear.‚Äù She gave a small nod. ‚ÄúDo it. And don‚Äôt forget to drag that one out,‚Äù she added, tipping her head slightly toward the unconscious man on the floor.
The man gave a slight nod, then said in accented English, ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù
The butt of the gun crashed into the side of Harper‚Äôs head. White-hot pain flared through his skull, and the world dropped out from under him, swallowing him into blackness.
Gunshots erupted, sharp and deafening, blending with the fury of the storm outside as thunder cracked and rain battered the quiet cul-de-sac. From the outside, 113 Warren Court looked still, peaceful ‚Äî an illusion masking the horror inside.
Across the street, a porch light flicked on. Curtains shifted in a window, a brief, uncertain motion. Another house, farther down, lit up faintly, shadows moving behind the blinds.
Inside the Harper home, the air hung heavy with gunpowder, the warmth drained away. Nothing moved now, except the slow, steady simmer of the stew on the stove.",1,1748228173.0,NewAuthor,0,1.0,False

I want to improve and eliminate this issue. I use a Breville Bambino Plus and an Encore ESP Grinder (set to grind size 17)

Here‚Äôs my workflow:

- Use Chromatic Coffee Gamut whole beans.
- Dose 18.45g.
- Distribute the dose using a WDT.
- Tap the portafilter lightly to settle the grounds slightly.
- Use a Normcore spinning distribution tool to flatten the bed of coffee grounds slightly (set to the shallowest depth to avoid compaction before tamping).
- Tamp down using a self-leveling Normcore tamper. I tamp down and quickly rotate the tamper slightly, then pull up to decompress the tamp. Without rotation, the grounds tend to stick to the tamper. I do this twice. This technique has been consistent with my shot pulls ever since I realized the grounds stick to the tamper.
- Place a screen on top of the puck.
- Pull the shot and yield 43g in 35 seconds (measured from the push of the button‚Ä¶ a bit higher of an extraction time, but I find this to be the sweet spot)",3,1748228169.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1kvjvnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1kvjvnh/sphenes_appearances_and_personality_spoiler_72/,Sphene‚Äôs appearances and personality [spoiler: 7.2],"As you probably know there are three types of Sphene‚Äôs, endless Sphene, simulant, and original Sphene. To help draw a bit of a distinction between the three, I managed to create some descriptions of each of them, from appearances to personalities. It'll have some info from the wiki, but it‚Äôll use something‚Äôs we also see in the game.

**Endless Sphene:** This is the first Sphene we meet in dawntrail, who only appeared in the main story itself. Despite being a bit cold, she‚Äôs kind and caring towards her people and tries her best to help them out. She also shows a bit of emotion, but not too much of it, like her reluctance of her own actions or even sympathy for others like the young boy who got an illness. She desires to help keep all of her people alive forever and wants to make sure that most if not all of them don‚Äôt die. She has a bit of free will, like expressing emotions, but she‚Äôs mostly forced and controlled by preservation to do terrible things that she never wanted to do in the first place. Like the simulant, she‚Äôs just a digital entity who‚Äôs self aware but is controlled to fulfill pervervation‚Äôs goal. Endless Sphene also has two loops in her hair. She only has a few memories of the events during the storm surge as well as any memories of what people perceived Sphene as. She also shows love for her people and desires to protect their happiness no matter what. She also shows that she also trust people like WoL and his/her allies to help watch over people, when she is defeated.¬†

**Simulant:** This is the second Sphene we meet in dawn trail, who first appeared near the end of crossroads. This Sphene is the complete opposite of endless Sphene. She constantly smiles all the time no matter what happens and acts very positively in a very creepy and disturbing way. She‚Äôs completely cold hearted and doesn‚Äôt care about ever saving all of the alexandrians. The only thing she cares about is fulfilling preservation‚Äôs goals. She‚Äôs merely a loyal pawn to calyx and is willing to do any of his biddings. Like endless Sphene, she wears the same regal dress and is a digital entity. However, she‚Äôs completely controlled by preservation and is nothing more but a cold and hollow machine following her directives from preservation. Whenever she‚Äôs with the Alexandrians she‚Äôs kind hearted and optimistic. However when she‚Äôs not around her people (and with her enemies), she‚Äôs rude and tends to mock her opponents, like wuk lamat or even the original Sphene herself. She also doesn‚Äôt trust people as she only knows that everyone is just a pawn for calyx.

**Original Sphene:** This Sphene is the third Sphene we meet in dawn trail, who first appeared (as a mysterious figure) near the end of crossroads, and revealed in seekers of eternity. She's, if not, the original Queen Sphene who ruled over Alexandria four centuries ago. Compared to the two other Sphenes, She‚Äôs completely different from any of them. Unlike the two counterparts, she‚Äôs able to completely express all of her emotions freely, including her raw, powerful, and strong emotions. For example, she‚Äôs able to express her outrage when she found out about preservation making a mechanical mockery of Zelenia. Another example is when she becomes shocked that she‚Äôs been asleep for 4 centuries. She also shows sadness when she sees that her people were attacked by the sentries, even letting a teardrop on her arm. She has her own free will, allowing her to do whatever she wants like drinking Dali coffee. Compared to endless Sphene, original Sphene processes tons of memories of her time four centuries ago. For example she remembered zelenia and Otis and how they fought as well as trying to learn magic to help until her parents died, forcing her to give up and become queen. Another example is that she remembers how there‚Äôs a railroad connected between Lindblum and Alexandria, until it was removed due to soured relationships. Unlike endless Sphene and the simulant who both wear the same regal dress, she able to wear all types of outfit like her pajamas or her modern outfit. She also wears the modern outfit, that has a hooded coat on, to blend into the crowd during seekers of eternity. She‚Äôs also able to learn and use magic, which is what both the simulant or endless Sphene couldn‚Äôt do, despite both of them being powerful in their ways. She also shows that while she doesn‚Äôt have any interest in making any of her people immortal, she still wanted to make sure most if not all of them are happy and safe. Another thing to also point out is that the original Sphene also doesn‚Äôt have two loops in her hair like her two counterparts and her hair is more natural then theirs.

Here‚Äôs the wiki page to also help distinguish the three Sphenes and their differences:

[https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sphene](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Sphene)¬†

Anyways I hope you enjoy my comparison to the three Sphenes and how each of them are different.

And the obligatory I'm typing on mobile so that's why the format of this post looks funky. Also I wasn't sure what flair to use but I feel like I should add that I go into my behaviors and not encourage anyone to do what I do. 

I know that hydrophobia is a real symptom with rabies sufferers but that's not what I'm talking about. 
I just can't stand water or fluids for that matter and it's gotten so bad in two different ways. 

I used to love bathing and skin care but now I dread showering because I don't want to absorb the water in my hair and skin and it would show on the scale that I gained weight. YES of course I still shower and moisturize but I just hate it and now I try to dry myself as much as possible and my skin has suffered for it. I refuse to go on the scale after I shower for a while until I'm convinced the water absorption isn't a problem anymore.

The second way is much worse and that I hate drinking water even when I know I'm seriously dehydrated. It's like my restriction begins with only allowing myself my morning coffee with milk and sugar and that would be it for as long as I can push it. Then if I end up eating, I start to binge eat, and I have to take laxative, and I need to take water with that. Somehow the water makes the discomfort WORSE. Yes my stomach could hurt from eating but I swear it's like taking in liquid makes my stomach expand way more and making it extremely painful. I'll spend the rest of the day in agony waiting to either throw up or use the bathroom or anything to relieve some pressure. I hate the way it makes me look when I see the mirror because I seriously look deformed. 
The worst part is that I won't even urinate after taking fluid for some time. Before, fluid would go through me in like seconds after having water, juice, soda, etc. Now it's like it takes hours for me to get the water to convert to urine. 

I KNOW that these are signs that I NEED to hydrate more, but I don't WANT to. 

This is absolute lunacy and I never would've thought it'd get this bad.  ",3,1748227562.0,EDAnonymous,0,1.0,False

1kvjp5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1kvjp5e/a_love_letter/,A Love Letter,"I was taught what ""love"" was. 

A game, a dance, a contest of wits. I was told it was the most beautiful thing in the world. I witnessed the pain and lies. Domiance, delirium, disception. Purity, a way to do it right, bliss, chemical addiction.

A masquarade of two parties, using each other.

I remember when we were in bed, my arms around you, one hand on your shoulder, another on your spine. You asked me if i wanted this. I nodded. You asked me, firmly, more telling than asking, ""is it just because you think i want this?""

And i froze. I couldn't say anything. I couldn't look you in the eyes as you looked into mine. Predatory. I felt like a deer looking at a rifle, moments before the shot rings through the air. I knew you knew. 

I remember how you kissed me, and pulled yourself off me. I dont remember the words, but i remember affection and understanding, softly covering my exposed body beyond view in covers after catching me in my lie. 

A wife's duties. To make him love you, give him sex, be pliant, be willing. If you cannot gift him things, gift him your body. Remembering being told by adults as a teenager that ""once you are old enough and married, just give him your body to please him."" Being told that the best I could hope for was to find a good, religious husband. A man who would let me stay home with my children. 

You are not that; you brushed my hair to the side and told me i didn't need to give you my body to loved. You push me to learn, you told me you saw a bright future with me. That I could potentially provide more to our future family as a career woman than you. Pushed me to expand my studies, to take risks. 

Careful control, adjusting the way I present myself for maximum efficiency. Hiding being an apostate, hiding my feelings, choking them down to keep the peace. Accepting things verbally I scorn inside, all because I knew dissent would do nothing.

And yet, you make me feel like a feral dog. I feel myself drool and froth at the mouth from anger, indignation, desire for more. 

Who is to say my place is that of a housewife, of a mother? Who is to say I will want to give it all up once I ""inevitability"" bear offspring. Who are they to tell me that I'm to become pregnant before age 27?

You inspire in me a true rage to all that has placed me on a leash. I decided to allow you influence over me, and you carefully unwound the psychological chains I was in.

I don't know when, but my mask has long since started splintering away. Undernearth, I find a woman of deep personal conviction and want. 

I was so convienced I knew what ""love"" was. You ripped that notion away from me. Love is animalistic, messy, soft, comforting, eyes meeting in low light, shared food. It is not a white wedding in the eyes of God and the Church. It is shared conviction, ravenous pursuit of goals, mutual growth, shared space. 

I am glad we are not inseparable as my parents were. I much prefer our dance to being graphted onto you, an additional appendage, fused together like two anglerfish, shared bloodstream. 

I was told love completes you. Two become one. I realize now, looking at you, that they were all wrong. I am complete, as I am. So are you. Our flavors just compliment each other. Coffee and chocolate. Wine and cheese. Each one unique and whole, enhancing the other when had together, yet wonderfully when paired with other items as well. 

I feel voracious in a way I never imagined possible as a girl.

There will never be satisfactory words to express these things. I don't need you. You are my favorite mixed medium to create my life with. You are hot chocolate on cold winter's nights, watermelon with friends in July heat, the smell of the ocean spray, or maybe ferns, in the air. The moment before impact with the ball in play. The tension and excitement before the trigger is pulled.

I love you- and I don't expect you to share these feelings or thoughts. 

That's why I love you

The Overlook is a swanky penthouse caf√© with an exclusive bar. I wanted this build to feel luxury and upscale, but still very cozy. Rustic, with modern touches that elevate the look.¬†

I imagine The Overlook being one of those spots that‚Äôs always packed to the brim and hard to get into on the weekends. A beloved community space amongst all the adults in SimTown that's constantly making waves in the press and on socials.

1. The first floor features a courtyard with a to-go/pickup order station. I imagine they get tons of pick-up and delivery orders from the building below and surrounding skyscrapers, and constantly have a crazy lunch rush. The coffee bar offers a wide array of espresso, cold brew towers, hot and cold teas, fresh-pressed juices, lunch items, pastries, and weekly wine tastings. I can imagine this location having a long-standing relationship with a local bakery where they get the fresh bread and jams they sell. Throughout each week, locals can visit The Overlook for open mic nights, poetry slams, and live performances from local acts.
2. The second floor features additional seating surrounding a mezzanine overlooking the stage below. Also on the second floor is a screening area. I could totally see this caf√© screening local films, sports, and news. One of my favorite little spaces on this level is the soundproof study room. The perfect workspace for Sims who want to come in and be productive at the Overlook. It also has a small balcony so Sims can get some fresh air while they‚Äôre working hard! A manager‚Äôs office and janitorial closet + staff bathroom are also on this level.¬†
3. On the top floor, you‚Äôll find The Overlook‚Äôs exclusive bar-- serving curated, top-shelf cocktails, local wine and champagne, plus small bites. Sims can come here to shoot some pool, play darts, grab a bottle of wine from a local vineyard, and enjoy scenic city views, great music, and an overall chill time.¬†

Feels good to finally enjoy the finished product of this build! I do want to continue adding a few more details and decorations but I‚Äôm so happy with how it turned out!¬†",6,1748227139.0,simsfreeplay,2,1.0,False

Lily and Joey had been drowning in sexual tension for a while, so no one was surprised when they sneaked into the woods for what I could only guess was the most uncomfortable sex ever. 

But then they didn‚Äôt come back.

Teddy and Yuri went looking for them, and then they, too, disappeared. It was almost like a wild animal was lying in wait for another unsuspecting teenager to cross its path.

With six of us left, I was definitely freaking out.

This wasn‚Äôt what I expected from summer camp. I had considered working at my local Sephora, but my mom had other plans‚Äîand whether I was eighteen years old or not, she was getting her way. 

So, goodbye civilization, and hello Canadian wilderness.

There were fifteen kids queued up in front of me for lunch, and I was struggling to keep that optimistic Camp Redwood smile.

I kept counting the hours since the latest disappearance: Connor. He was supposed to be helping with the emergency generator after the electricity sizzled out.

He was gone an hour later. Whatever was happening to the counselors was accelerating. Would it happen to me?

I had seen so many TV shows and movies set in summer camps where every camper and counselor was doomed to die in the most gruesome ways. Was that going to happen to us?

I tightened my grip on the ladle as I stirred a giant pot of chocolate syrup. 

Watching watery chocolate drip from the edge, I felt nauseous. 

Of all the summer camps my mom could have sent me to, it had to be the one with vanishing counselors and zero adult authority. 

Which meant we were the authority. Twelve teenagers, who‚Äôd come to relax and babysit a bunch of little kids before college.

We had to put on brave faces and pretend everything was fine‚Äîand that we weren‚Äôt all terrified out of our minds.

Out of the corner of my eye, I glimpsed Harry giving piggybacks to a bunch of little kids. One of them, Eleanor, had her arms wrapped around his neck, squealing. 

Judging by the look on his face, he wanted to stop. It was hard to keep a facade when reality was becoming harder and harder to bear. 

His hat long abandoned, Harry was dripping with sweat, trying to keep up the Camp Redwood grin. But as he galloped around the cabin with Eleanor clinging to him, he looked ready to collapse. I didn‚Äôt blame him.

Entertaining the kids had been Teddy‚Äôs assignment‚Äîand he was who knows where. I had taken over lunch duties for Lily, who had joined the long list of the missing.

Harry was supposed to be joining the search party for the missing counselors, but he‚Äôd ended up as the kids‚Äô personal punching bag.

When I first met him, Harry Carlisle was the kid who sat on the sidelines, offering sarcastic remarks and crude jokes. Now, he‚Äôd been reduced to a playground ride the kids pretended didn‚Äôt have an off switch.

He might have enjoyed the first few rides to lift morale, but now I could see the strain in his eyes. ‚ÄúOw!‚Äù Harry winced as Eleanor‚Äôs fingers poked at his eyes. 

‚ÄúHey! Eleanor, not my eyes!‚Äù He was dangerously close to toppling over, but managed to catch his footing, ordering all of them off his back. 

‚ÄúHorse rides are over!‚Äù he announced, cupping his hands around his mouth when a group of kids surrounded him, faces alight with mischief. 

Harry backed away, hands up. ‚ÄúCome on, guys, my back isn‚Äôt built for all of you!‚Äù

‚ÄúHorsey!‚Äù the kids shouted back in a cacophony of giggles.

It was ten against one.

Against two, if I got involved. Which wasn‚Äôt going to happen. There was no way I was play-fighting a bunch of eight-year-olds. Harry shot me a hopeful look, but I pretended not to see, busying myself with slightly burned nuggets.

Harry ran his fingers through thick strands of sandy-colored hair and grimaced when a little girl, Phoebe, stepped forward.

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù Harry shook his head, squeezing the front of his counselor shirt practically glued to him. The temperature hadn‚Äôt let up, even though it was almost 8PM. 

Nighttime, I thought dizzily. 

It was almost bedtime, and still no adults. ‚ÄúI refuse to surrender,‚Äù he told her. 

‚ÄúPhoebe, I‚Äôm not joking around when I say my back is hurting. We‚Äôve been playing horsey for two hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo?‚Äù

‚ÄúSo!‚Äù Harry couldn‚Äôt yell, hiss, or swear at them. That was a big no-no with kids.

However, I could see he was close to breaking that rule. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm tired,‚Äù he said, forcing a Camp Redwood grin that was quickly twitching into a grimace.

I think we‚Äôd all given up on fake enthusiasm after the disappearances started. 

Now, we were just shells of our former happy selves. ‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ uh‚Ä¶ did you know that if you ride a horsey at this time, the ghosts will come and get you?‚Äù

When a boy‚Äôs eyes widened with fright, Harry realized his mistake.

‚ÄúI mean, the nice ghosts! Yeah! The, uh, nice ghosts who haunt‚Ä¶ I mean play in these woods. It‚Äôs a well-known Camp Redwood legend that ghosts don‚Äôt like horse rides. In fact‚Ä¶‚Äù 

His lips curved into a devilish smile as he held the kids‚Äô attention. 

They dropped onto the ground, hands clasped in their laps. It was the quietest they‚Äôd been all day. I understood. 

Harry had taken over ghost stories at the campfire for three nights in a row, and he was a damn good storyteller.

With every eye on him, Harry lowered his voice to a whisper. ‚ÄúDo you guys want to know what they do?‚Äù

The kids nodded, eyes wide.

‚ÄúThey sneak into unsuspecting cabins‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry.‚Äù

Rowan‚Äôs voice sounded from outside in a warning. 

The window was open, and he was standing watch, waiting to see if any counselors came back. 

Since the only adult had vanished, he‚Äôd taken charge‚Äîand the guy was taking himself a little too seriously.

His warning was valid, though. Harry‚Äôs ghost stories could be a bit too much for the younger kids, who had wild imaginations, especially at night. 

Olive, my cabin-mate, had given up her bed for a little girl who was convinced Harry‚Äôs ‚Äútree boy‚Äù was going to sneak into her bed and turn her into an apple seed.

‚ÄúDid I say sneak into cabins? I meant dance around the woods‚Ä¶‚Äù Harry corrected himself. ‚ÄúAnd they look for their next unsuspecting victim‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHarry!‚Äù

‚ÄúFriend,‚Äù Harry swallowed his words when a little boy‚Äôs eyes went wide. 

‚ÄúI mean, they‚Äôre looking for a friend! So, the point of my story is‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúHorsey rides get us new friends?‚Äù Phoebe wasn‚Äôt buying it, judging by her arched brow and widening smile.

The girl shook dark curls out of her face, smirking. 

I think it was her pleading eyes that won him over, because, with a sigh, he dropped to his knees and grudgingly told her to climb on his back‚Äîand she did, putting one sparkling shoe on his spine with enough force to send him to his stomach. 

Maybe I was imagining it, but since when were these littles so spiteful?

The little girl was grinning, not because she got to ride her ‚Äúhorsey,‚Äù but because Harry looked ready to either wring her neck or his own. Mom had warned me that, without adult authority, little kids could start to act out.

I could call it ‚Äúacting out,‚Äù but I‚Äôd spent an entire day with her earlier, playing with dolls and having a teddy bear picnic when she admitted she didn‚Äôt want to swim in the lake. Phoebe had been shy and spoke to me through her teddy bear. What had changed?

Could the lack of adults really be scaring the kids that much?

‚ÄúMiss Josie?‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt paying attention, only half-noticing as kids helped themselves, piling chicken nuggets and cookies on plastic plates and hurrying to their seats as if I couldn‚Äôt see them.

Blinking away brain fog, I found myself face-to-face with Eli, who was probably my favorite camper.

You‚Äôre not supposed to have personal preferences when working with little kids because your opinions could upset them.

However, it was incredibly hard not to like Eli.

Hiding behind a mop of brown curls, Eli was one of the more vocal kids in the group. He said he wanted to be an inventor when he was older, and he wanted to make robots. 

The kid had even asked me if I wanted to see his robot collection, but I was too busy setting up camp activities. 

Standing in front of me and clutching his tray, Eli was frowning.

‚ÄúJosie, I just saw some kids steal chicken nuggets.‚Äù

I shrugged, shoveling a large portion onto his tray. ‚ÄúWell, you can have some extra too.‚Äù

Eli‚Äôs smile wasn‚Äôt as big as usual. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Teddy?‚Äù

I pretended to be oblivious, hastily adding more nuggets to his tray as if I could keep his mouth shut with extra food. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be back soon! Teddy is just playing in the woods.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, he‚Äôs not.‚Äù

At first, I thought I‚Äôd heard him wrong. Eli wasn‚Äôt looking at me, instead counting his nuggets as usual with the prongs of his plastic fork.

I leaned forward with my best smile. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, what was that, Eli?‚Äù

He lifted his head with a wide grin. ‚ÄúCan I borrow a knife, Josie?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy do you need a knife?‚Äù

Leaning forward, the boy shrugged. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a squirrel caught in a trap,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI want to put it out of its misery, Miss Josie. It‚Äôs in a lot of pain.‚Äù

That was‚Ä¶ dark.

‚ÄúWell, I can‚Äôt give you a knife‚Ä¶‚Äù I trailed off, my gaze finding Harry and the growing line of kids waiting for a horse ride. 

‚ÄúBut! How about you go ask Harry for a piggy-back ride?‚Äù I pointed to myself with a forced grin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save the squirrel!‚Äù 

When Eli‚Äôs eyes filled with tears and he shook his head, I reached out, grasping his hand, and squeezed it as tight as I could. ‚ÄúEli, we don‚Äôt need to do that, okay? I‚Äôm sure the squirrel can be saved, and I‚Äôll make sure to take it to the vet, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what if it doesn‚Äôt need saving?‚Äù

I squeezed tighter. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll save it, Eli. I promise.‚Äù

Eli didn‚Äôt look convinced, but he nodded with a grumble. 

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù he said, before twisting around and joining the other kids torturing Harry. Immediately, I left my station‚Äîwhether Rowan liked it or not‚Äîand headed outside to look for this supposedly dying squirrel. That was something we didn‚Äôt need.

The sky was darkening when I made it into the woods, cotton-candy clouds blurring through the thick canopy of trees. Eli had said it was near the sign pointing toward the lake. But I couldn‚Äôt see anything. Odd. 

That thought retracted in my head, however, when I stepped forward, and a squelching sound cut through the silence of my heavy breaths mixing with insect chirping and nightlife buzzing above and below me. 

The wet squelch twisted my gut, and when I stared down at the ground, I didn‚Äôt know what I was expecting.

A squashed squirrel, perhaps? 

In Eli‚Äôs words, the poor thing had been on the edge of death. Though, when I thought about it, there were no animal traps around camp. That was basic health and safety. So, what the heck was I looking at? 

The bottom of my shoe was caked in dried blood, but it was the thing stamped into the dirt that sent my heart into my throat. 

It looked like‚Ä¶ an eye.

But looking closer as I lowered myself to the ground, I glimpsed something metallic, something glistening around the pupil. I picked up a stick and prodded it, though the thing didn‚Äôt move. It was definitely an eye‚Äîthe eye of some kind of animal, judging from the pigmentation and the color of the iris.

But it was the metallic pieces around the eye that threw me off. Part of a trap, maybe? It wouldn‚Äôt be out of the realm of possibility that a poor critter had been ripped apart, and a wild bear had dropped its dinner near the camp‚Äîand the metal encasing its eye was likely pieces of a trap.

Peering closer, though, I glimpsed silver slivers in what appeared to be destroyed nerves caked to my shoe. 

After scraping most of it off, I caught glistening pieces of blood-stained metal catching the late-setting sun. This time, I pinched a piece between my forefinger and thumb. It didn‚Äôt look like a bear trap. 

The metal itself wasn‚Äôt serrated or old. In fact, it was new.

Which begged the question: What was this thing?

Whatever it was, it had started converting what looked like a critter‚Äôs eye before stopping. Was it a virus? When that thought hit me, I fell back with a hiss, swiping my hands on my shirt.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

I almost jumped out of my skin, diving to my feet.

Carmel was standing behind me, grasping what looked like her sixth or seventh coffee. The girl had been running to and from the coffee machine all day, and I had been silently counting her caffeine intake. 

Carmel had been a well-put-together and fairly popular girl when camp started. 

She immediately had everyone following her beck and call, with boys (and girls) trailing after her.

Carmel wasn‚Äôt straight. She made that clear on the bus to camp, announcing she wasn‚Äôt interested in guys and had a girlfriend back home. 

Still, the boys followed her because... well, she was pretty. Carmel was my bunkmate and had woken me up on three separate occasions at 6am to go through the exact same hair and makeup routine. 

Now, though, there was no sign of makeup or even that she had brushed her hair.

Instead of her usual tidy blonde ponytail, Carmel‚Äôs curls were tied into raggedy pigtails with ribbons I was sure she‚Äôd stolen from a camper‚Äôs doll. I think what was keeping her going was coffee.

Carmel regarded me with too-wide eyes and a Camp Redwood smile we all knew was fake. She was clutching her coffee cup for dear life. ‚ÄúJosie!‚Äù She jumped when I jumped, which almost made me laugh. 

‚ÄúRowan‚Äôs having an emergency meeting in his cabin,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm pretty sure he's also having a meltdown, but that's a him problem!‚Äù Her gaze flicked to the ground. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ *are* you doing?‚Äù

For a brief moment, I considered telling Carmel I may have found what looked like a virus that turned flesh and blood to metal‚Äîbefore I remembered her reaction when a spider had crept into our cabin.

Whatever this thing was, keeping it a secret for now was probably for the best. Making sure I was standing on it, I shrugged. ‚ÄúI was looking for the others.‚Äù

Carmel cocked her head, then rested her coffee on the ground. ‚ÄúIn the dirt?‚Äù

‚ÄúFootprints, Carmel.‚Äù

She looked confused before shaking her head. ‚ÄúOkay, whatever. Tell the others I‚Äôll be there in a sec. I just need to make sure the kids are okay. We‚Äôre putting a movie on for them in the lunch hall, so that‚Äôll hopefully distract them for maybe two hours. I'm thinking of Frozen, or Frozen Two.‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúDid anyone find a phone?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot with signal!‚Äù 

‚ÄúCarmel.‚Äù I had to fight back the urge to yell at her to keep her voice down. Kids were curious, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if we had some littles peeking into our conversation. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre okay,‚Äù I said softly.

‚ÄúI mean, we‚Äôre not okay, because yes, things are very... screwed up right now, but we need to be‚Ä¶ optimistic.‚Äù I exhaled, searching for eyes in the dark. 

I tried to smile, trying to keep up that Camp Redwood fa√ßade we were all held hostage by until the last day of camp. 

(According to rule 5 in the Camp Redwood counselor handbook, all counselors must retain a smile and a positive attitude. 

5. If ANY counselor is caught making a frowny face or spreading what we call ‚Äúunhappiness,‚Äù we will be forced to send the counselor home).

At this point, I didn‚Äôt care‚Äîbut part of me didn‚Äôt want to scare the little kids.

‚ÄúNo, Josie.‚Äù Carmel grabbed my shoulders with a grin rivaling the Joker. ‚ÄúI am so sick of being told to keep smiling, because what is that doing? Three of my cabin-mates are missing! I‚Äôm the only one left, and Rowan and co expect me to keep up this act? We are fucked!""

She cupped her mouth. ‚ÄúF. U. C. K. E. D.‚Äù

I took a step back, keeping hold of her hand. Carmel was trembling, her hands clammy and slick, entangled in mine. ‚ÄúRowan is just trying to keep the kids from freaking out.‚Äù

She groaned, tears glistening in her eyes. ‚ÄúYes, but nothing is okay!‚Äù

‚ÄúEverything IS okay.‚Äù I turned to her with what I hoped was a reassuring smile‚Äîknowing damn well about the thing I‚Äôd found in the dirt. If that thing could spread, it would have a field day in an enclosed space like a summer camp.

I noticed my own hands, which had been touching the thing, making contact with Carmel, and dropped them, inwardly squirming.

If that thing was a virus, I was already fucked.

Maybe Carmel too.

If it was fast-acting, it could explain the counselors' disappearances. 

I was already putting together a plan in my head as we headed back to the main cabin. 

We had to put together a search party. Some of us would stay with the kids, while a small group would venture into the woods to try and look for traces of the missing. If I was right, we would find a horror scene in the woods, and yes, that would be the time to panic.

If I was wrong, however, there was still hope.

‚ÄúAre we going to be okay?‚Äù

Carmel‚Äôs voice sliced into my thoughts, and I took a moment to drink in the camp around us.

Usually, when the sky turned twilight, it would be bustling with campers and counselors toasting marshmallows on the fire and gathering around to fall asleep to Harry‚Äôs ghost stories. 

Carmel would be kneeling with a bunch of kids, watching a YouTube video they had all insisted on her watching, while Rowan would be hiding behind his book with his knees to his chest, his gaze glued to every page he flipped through, ignoring everyone.

Teddy would be making funny faces for kids who were scared, and Connor would be handing out plates of burgers. 

I remembered feeling safe and at home, cozy around the flickering orange of the fire as chatter turned to laughter and white noise in my head. After the kids went back to their cabins, the group of us would resume our positions around the fire, but this time it was more‚Ä¶ intimate. 

With Allison in her cabin, we kind of ignored her rules altogether.

Making out happened, because of course it did. 

Beers stolen from Allison‚Äôs mini fridge and raging hormones, as well as late-night skinny dipping in the lake did that. 

Couples went off into the woods, and we all felt completely comfortable and at home with each other.

Looking around at that moment, I felt sick to my stomach. That feeling was gone.

The feeling of family, familiarity, and friendship. What I was looking at now was that same log we had all sat on, now turned on its side‚Äîhot dog buns and candy wrappers littering the ground. It was a ghost camp.

I could still see Connor‚Äôs jacket slung on the ground and Lili‚Äôs bright pink Ray-Bans sitting on a beer can. Because there were no adults to yell at us to clean up after ourselves. I was frowning at the skeleton of the fire when Carmel nudged me. 

‚ÄúHey.‚Äù Her voice was shaking. ‚ÄúJosie? You didn‚Äôt answer my question.‚Äù 

Carmel wanted me to be the voice of reason, and I wasn‚Äôt that. I was just as scared as she was.

There was only so much I could sugarcoat, and I gave up doing that after the third counselor disappeared. All I could offer her was forced optimism.

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust keep the kids busy, alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight.‚Äù

When I twisted around and power-walked to Rowan‚Äôs cabin, I shouted over my shoulder, ‚ÄúGive them some of those animal crackers!‚Äù

Carmel shouted back, ‚ÄúWait, *what* animal crackers?‚Äù

I turned to elaborate, but she was gone.

When I finally got to Rowan‚Äôs cabin, I was sweating through my shirt and had an idea of what I was going to tell the others. 

It was‚Ä¶ a thing, which could be considered a disease or a virus‚Äîso it was vital that we split into two groups: half of us would search for the others, while the rest would look for anything to get in contact with the outside world‚Äîan emergency landline, laptop, or cell phone.

I did have one problem: lack of evidence. All that was left from the thing I‚Äôd found was stuck to my foot. The rest of it was buried in the dirt. It was too dark to search for it, and we would be wasting time doing so.

All of that was on my mind and tangled on my tongue, one single string of incomprehensible gibberish I wasn‚Äôt even sure was English, when I stepped into Rowan‚Äôs cabin, where four sets of eyes met mine.

Olive was cross-legged on the floor with her arms folded, Harry was pacing up and down with a brand new bruise blooming under his eye, courtesy of Eleanor almost poking his eyes out‚Äîand Rowan himself was sitting on the top bunk, his legs swinging off the side.

The guy wasn‚Äôt built to be our leader, originally being the laziest of our group, opting to sit in a tree with a book rather than help set up camp activities. 

Yet he had become our default guy in charge because he so happened to be wearing the head counselor hat when Allison disappeared. 

Admittedly, it suited him; the bright red of the cap contrasted with his dark curls under a late-setting sun through the back window, setting strands of straying hair on fire.

The hat was a little too big for his head, though, slipping over his eyes.

Rowan looked like a divorced father of two, dark circles bruising his eyes, and a very ‚Äúdad-like‚Äù scowl curling on his lips.

With a clipboard pressed to his chest and a pen he was chewing on, the boy resembled a grown man who had just caught his daughter coming in after curfew. ‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù Spitting the pen‚Äôs lid out of his mouth, he scribbled something down. 

I had no doubt he was tracking my attendance for these stupid crisis meetings. His eyes were wild, scanning me for answers. ‚ÄúI should have known.‚Äù

I raised my brow. ‚ÄúShould have known *what*?‚Äù

Rowan scribbled something else. ‚ÄúThat you would be the last to join us.‚Äù

I threw my hands up, exasperated. ‚ÄúWe're in a *crisis*. 

‚ÄúYou're still late.‚Äù he grumbled. ‚ÄúWhere the fuck is Carmel?‚Äù

I shut the door behind me, leaning against it with my arms folded. ‚ÄúSo, we can swear now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù Rowan rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThere are no kids here, so go crazy.‚Äù He pointed at me with the pen. ‚ÄúCarmel. Where is she?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeeping the kids busy,‚Äù Callan‚Äôs muffled voice came from the bottom bunk. 

I could barely see the guy lying on his stomach, his face stuffed into a pillow. 

‚ÄúIt was my idea to play Shrek for them, but the little shits said they haven‚Äôt seen it,‚Äù the boy lifted his head, his lips carved into a scowl. 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, am I tripping? Everyone‚Äôs seen Shrek! Do these kids expect the Minecraft movie?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt like that, either,‚Äù Harry stopped pacing the cabin. ‚ÄúEleanor looked at me like I was crazy when I asked if she liked it.""

‚ÄúFortnite, too,‚Äù Olive said, a cushion pressed to her chest. ‚ÄúI suggested playing it a few days ago, and like, zero kids knew what it was.‚Äù

‚ÄúSix counselors are missing,‚Äù Rowan raised his voice over the others' chatter. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre questioning what games they like?‚Äù His eyes found mine once more. ‚ÄúSo, Carmel is with the kids? You‚Äôre absolutely sure of it?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. I mean, I just saw her five minutes ago.‚Äù

‚ÄúGreat,‚Äù Rowan said sarcastically. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure she won‚Äôt go missing under mysterious circumstances.‚Äù

‚ÄúStop.‚Äù Olive shot him a glare, throwing a cushion in his face. ‚ÄúI told you. They‚Äôre probably lost‚Äîor maybe they went to get help?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all been trained to know every inch of these woods,‚Äù Rowan catapulted the cushion right back at her. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not lost.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, where are they?!‚Äù Callan sat up, bringing his knees to his chest. I had never seen the guy look this vulnerable. 

‚ÄúAllison made sense. She probably had other duties and left us to look after the kids. But six counselors? All of them disappearing‚Äîour phone signal completely cutting out, electricity cutting off, not once, but twice? What is even sucking all of our power?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got the emergency generator working,‚Äù Olive raised her arm. ‚ÄúConnor and I managed it before‚Ä¶‚Äù She trailed off.

‚ÄúBefore Connor disappeared,‚Äù Callan finished for her. ‚ÄúAnd before him, it was Joey, Lily, Mira, Yuri, Noah, and Teddy. Which isn‚Äôt a fucking coincidence.‚Äù He shot Rowan a look, who glared down at his lap. 

I could tell the boy didn‚Äôt want to lead all of us, come up with plans, and answer the questions we desperately needed answered. 

His job was to look after us, as well as the littles, and so far, he was doing a pretty good job. I could tell by his expression that he thought the opposite, but he had managed to keep the kids from finding out about something as sinister as someone actively kidnapping counselors.

He made sure they were fed, entertained, and safe, watching a movie‚Äîwhile we were scared for our lives. 

Rowan was keeping up the fa√ßade, no matter how scared he was. 

The boy dropped his head into his lap with a sigh. It looked like he might fall asleep before he slammed the clipboard into his face to wake himself up.

Nobody wanted to admit what Callan was saying, but we were all definitely thinking it. ‚ÄúThis was planned,‚Äù Callan continued.

‚ÄúSomeone out here is fucking with us, very clearly trying to freak us out. Now they've got six of us.‚Äù 

He spread his arms. ‚ÄúHow long until one of the littles gets taken, huh? A bunch of eighteen-year-olds aren‚Äôt going to satisfy them, so what about when they start taking campers? We are in the middle of fuckin‚Äô nowhere with a serial kidnapper on the loose, and did we really just leave fifteen kids in the care of a girl who thought Australia was in England?‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Carmel‚Äôs defense, she was drunk when she said that,‚Äù Olive murmured.

‚ÄúVoice down!‚Äù Rowan hissed. ‚ÄúDo you want to scare them?!‚Äù His gaze flicked to me. ‚ÄúDid you do a headcount during dinner?‚Äù

I nodded. ‚ÄúFifteen kids all accounted for. Ten are in the lunch hall, and five girls are in Cassie‚Äôs cabin playing Operation.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll day?‚Äù Olive spoke up. ‚ÄúWeren‚Äôt they playing that this morning? I tried to get into their cabin to give them breakfast, but they just shooed me away and locked the door.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù Rowan ran his fingers down his face. ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll go see what‚Äôs going on with them. Knowing Cassie and her friends, they‚Äôre probably zonked out on stolen candy. When all of the kids are accounted for in the lunch cabin, we gather outside.‚Äù

I swallowed, speaking up. ‚ÄúI actually wanted to talk to you guys about something.‚Äù

Rowan lifted his head, jutting the edge of the clipboard into his chin. ‚ÄúGo on‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI found something?‚Äù I pulled a face. ‚ÄúI mean, I think I‚Äôve found something?‚Äù

I wasn't sure how to explain to a dwindling group of exhausted teenagers that there may be something even more terrifying than potential kidnappers out there. Four blank faces stared back at me, and Rowan leaned forward with a frown. ‚ÄúLike, in general? Josie, we don‚Äôt have time to go foraging.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could call it a lead,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut I need your eyes to find it.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh. But what is it?‚Äù

Thinking back to what exactly I had seen, I had no idea how to describe it. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better if I just‚Ä¶ showed you.‚Äù

Rowan looked skeptical but nodded. ‚ÄúAlright. Josie comes with me. We‚Äôll check out Allison‚Äôs cabin again to look for an emergency line, and you can show me whatever this ‚Äòthing‚Äô is you‚Äôve found. 

Then we‚Äôll escort Cassie and the other girls to the lunch cabin. Every camper needs an escort from now on. The rest of you? Act normal. If the kids see you freaking out, they will also freak out‚Äîand we need to keep up morale.‚Äù

The boy pointed to Olive. 

‚ÄúOlive, you sit in with the kids and look after them. Callan, check out the emergency generator. Harry, the kids see you as a playground ride, so use that to your advantage. Offer them horse rides if they‚Äôre scared. And stop with the ghost stories; it‚Äôs making it worse. Give them piggybacks.‚Äù

Harry rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúDo I have a choice?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Rowan cleared his throat. ‚ÄúWe all keep up appearances. If the others turn up after getting high or‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know, having an orgy in the woods‚Äî I will fucking *kill* them.‚Äù 

The way he smiled through his teeth, jumping off the bunk, his toes primed like a wild animal, I knew he wasn‚Äôt joking. 

If this was a well-constructed prank the other counselors were playing, I had no doubt Rowan would rip them apart for leaving him as a reluctant leader. 

To my surprise, the others wandered off with their tasks.

I watched Rowan lift up his pillow and pull out a pack of animal crackers, ripping open the bag and pouring the contents into his mouth. He caught my eye, crunching through mini animal crackers. 

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have lunch,‚Äù he said through a mouthful.

I couldn‚Äôt help feeling a sense of relief as we headed across camp, Rowan in front of me while I lagged behind.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù I caught up to him, almost tripping over a log.

The guy didn‚Äôt turn around. ‚ÄúI am completely fucking winging it, bro,‚Äù he said through a choked laugh. 

‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm doing, and if I‚Äôm honest? I just want to go home, dude. I haven‚Äôt looked after this many kids in my life, and if I have to smile one more time at a little brat, I am going to fucking lose my mind.‚Äù He heaved out a breath. 

‚ÄúI am making this up as I go along.‚Äù

I laughed that time. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ comforting.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù He turned to shoot me a grin. ‚ÄúWell, rest assured I am just about as scared‚Äîif not more scared than you.‚Äù 

As we stopped in front of Cassie‚Äôs cabin, his gaze found mine. ‚ÄúIs it me‚Ä¶‚Äù he said softly, ‚Äúor does the lunch cabin seem quiet?‚Äù

He was right. The windows were dark when they should have been illuminated by the TV screen. Instead of answering, I stepped in front of him, grasping hold of the cabin door. 

‚ÄúCassie?‚Äù I knocked three times. 

‚ÄúGirls, are you okay in there? It‚Äôs Josie and Rowan.‚Äù I tried the door, and it slid open. Shooting a look at the boy behind me, I turned back to the door.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre coming in, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù

Cassie squeaked from inside. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs not finished!‚Äù

Ignoring the coil of dread unraveling in my gut, I forced the door open and stepped into unusually milky white light, which flooded the cabin. 

The first thing I saw was eight-year-old Cassie, sitting cross-legged with her back to me. She was sitting in a circle with the other girls, no doubt playing their game.

When I stepped closer, however, I noticed something pooling across the wooden floor. It must have been juice or water that they had spilled. 

I took another step, but this time, clammy fingers wrapped around my wrist and yanked me back. Rowan didn't speak, but his eyes were elsewhere. 

Initially, they had been drinking in the cabin before they found oblivion entirely. I heard his breath start to accelerate, his grip tightening on my wrist.

I had half a mind to pull away before I saw the body-shaped carcass the girls were sitting around. In the dim light of the cabin, it used to be a person‚ÄîTeddy. 

I could still see parts of an identity:

Freckled cheeks and eyes that were still open, still staring at the sky. 

But that was where the similarities to the missing counselor ended. 

The thing that used to be Teddy was more of a shell, a scooped-out thing resembling a human body. 

What sent me stumbling backward, my mouth open in a silent scream, was the almost surgical efficiency of each organ's removal, like it really was a game of Operation. 

His heart, lungs, and intestines were in one pile‚Äîwhile his brain was cupped between little Cassie's bloody hands.

And when my gaze found the little girl, Nina, hiding behind dark curly hair, I saw what looked like a toy robot‚Äôs head in her hands. 

In my head, I was thinking about the eye with the metallic pieces glittering around its pupil, and something turned in my gut.

Did I find a human eye? 

I was staring at the crevice inside the boy's skull and the boxes of surgical equipment piled on the girl's bunks when Rowan finally pulled me back, and I stumbled straight onto my ass. There was no brain, just the pearly white of the guy‚Äôs skull. 

""We need to go,"" Rowan croaked. 

Cassie‚Äôs words rattled in my head. 

Teddy, I thought. Teddy wasn‚Äôt finished.

""Josie. Get up. Now!"" My head was spinning, and I was sure I‚Äôd thrown up. 

I didn‚Äôt even realize we had managed to stumble from the girl‚Äôs cabin before cool air grazed my face, tickling my cheeks. 

Something wet, warm, and lumpy was spattering the front of my shirt.

Before I could muster any words, the boy was pulling me to my feet, and I saw stars in my eyes, blinking brightly. 

When the two of us started forward in a run, Rowan stopped abruptly. I followed his gaze to find several kids surrounding his cabin, where Harry, Olive, and Callan were. 

Maybe I was hallucinating, but Eleanor and Phoebe‚Äîboth wielding weapons I had no idea where they got‚Äîlooked‚Ä¶ taller? 

Rowan didn‚Äôt waste time, dragging me back. 

‚ÄúAllison‚Äôs cabin,‚Äù he said, his voice rising to a cry that became a sob, pulling me across the camp and stumbling over the rocky ground. 

‚ÄúWe need a phone. Fuck, we need a phone. We need a fucking phone or I'm going to go insane, or maybe I am insane! Maybe I'm going fucking crazy!‚Äù 

Rowan struggled to stand, occasionally bending over and choking on dust. 

‚ÄúThey were playing Operation.‚Äù Rowan whispered in a hysterical giggle, which wasn‚Äôt like him. ‚ÄúWith Teddy.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut they‚Äôre just kids!‚Äù I choked out.

Little kids who had surgically removed every organ inside Teddy‚Äôs body.

Little kids who were hunting the other counselors down and would surely be coming for us.

Allison‚Äôs cabin was thankfully further into the woods. 

When we were safe inside and Rowan was locking the door, I dry heaved several times, unable to shake the image of glistening gore splattering the cabin floor from my mind. ‚ÄúJosie.‚Äù Rowan was already tearing apart the cabin. 

‚ÄúWork with me here, okay? We don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ we don‚Äôt have fucking time to freak out or to barf‚Äîwe need to get help. Now. Because this isn't normal.‚Äù 

His voice went strangely sing-song. ‚ÄúThiisss is not normal, this isn't *happening*.‚Äù 

Rowan was freaking out, and when he hit the ground on his knees, I took over. I searched Allison‚Äôs desk first.

Nothing of importance‚Äîjust documents and invoices. Digging through her drawer, there was still nothing. We were running out of time.

Abandoning the desk, I went through her suitcase and bags. 

When I crawled under her bed to try and find a weapon, Rowan hissed, ‚ÄúWait.‚Äù 

When I turned to him, he was still kneeling, but his foot was clamping down on a loose plank. The guy didn‚Äôt hesitate, pulling at the loose plank, which, to my confusion, revealed what looked like a trap door.

Rowan turned to me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre kidding.‚Äù

I could only stare at the trap door revealing stone steps. He peered down, his voice echoing. ‚ÄúAllison has a fucking secret bunker?‚Äù

His lips curved into a surprisingly childish grin that took me off guard. ‚ÄúOh, wow, that‚Äôs so cooooool!‚Äù

Lifting my head at the sound of loud squealing, I glimpsed a group of littles led by Eleanor stalking toward us. 

Eleanor had a hostage: Harry. 

And with the way she was sticking the blade of a scary-looking knife to his throat, I figured she meant business. 

Their height difference was almost comical. The eighteen-year-old guy had to hunch over so the little girl could successfully keep him prisoner. 

Behind them in the trees, I could see something illuminating the dark: an electric blue light bathing their faces.

So, that was where the power was going.

But what the fuck were these eight-year-olds doing?

‚ÄúJosie!‚Äù Rowan hissed from down below. He had already climbed down.

I joined him, struggling down the stone steps before replacing the loose plank. 

If these kids were as smart as I thought, it wouldn‚Äôt take them long to realize the loose plank was also a trap door. 

Allison‚Äôs bunker was more of a control room. There were multiple screens lit up and a chair in front of a working MacBook. The phone line was cut. 

But that didn‚Äôt make sense.

The kids were unaware of the bunker, so who cut the phone lines? Rowan was on the laptop, struggling to get through the password protection, so I turned my attention to piles of cardboard boxes.

When I opened them, I found myself staring at animal crackers.

There were hundreds of them, packed on top of each other. Looking further, digging through the boxes, I found a piece of old crumpled paper that looked ancient.

**REGARDING PROJECT SPEARHEAD SUBJECTS:**

**PLEASE DO NOT INGEST UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. IF MULTIPLE SUBJECTS INGEST, PLEASE USE SELF-DESTRUCT.**

**ONLY USE IN CASES SUCH AS IMMINENT DESTRUCTION TO THE PLANET/THREAT OF NUCLEAR WAR.**

**(PLEASE CONTACT FAMILIES IN ADVANCE. MAKE SURE TO INGEST WITH WATER TO AVOID NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PSYCHOSIS AND EXTREME VIOLENCE. PLEASE APPROACH SUBJECTS WITH CAUTION.)**

Something ice cold slithered down my spine.

Abandoning the boxes, I searched through a cabinet filled with files that were crumbling apart from age. I picked one at random and flicked through it.

Eleanor Summers.

Sex: Female.

DOB: 08/05/1977.

Initially, I thought I was reading the dates wrong. But then, with my heart in my throat, I grasped for other files.

Eli Evermore.

Sex: Male.

DOB: 08/03/1979.

‚ÄúRowan,‚Äù I managed to get out through a breath.

‚ÄúMm?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not children.‚Äù

The boy rubbed his eyes, frowning. His eyes were half-lidded, almost confused. ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù

‚ÄúEleanor,‚Äù I whispered. ‚ÄúIs forty-five years old.‚Äù

He nodded slowly, turning back to the laptop. ‚ÄúHow do you spell‚Ä¶ documents? I‚Äôm looking for digital versions, but I can‚Äôt find any.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how to spell documents?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a hard day,‚Äù the boy whined, tipping his head back and blowing a raspberry. ‚ÄúI'm tired. I wanna go nap.‚Äù

I tried to ignore the visible beads of sweat running down his face. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry, you want to go *nap*?‚Äù I hissed.

Rowan did a shoulder shrug. ‚ÄúI'm tired.‚Äù

Whatever I was going to say was choked in the back of my throat when a loud bang sounded from above, the sounds of childish giggling coming through the floorboards. 

But the laughter didn‚Äôt sound like little kids. 

No, it sounded like teenagers who were acting like little kids. 

I stared at the boxes of animal crackers and then at the file confirming Eleanor‚Äôs real age. 

My own words shuddered through me, and I remembered finding Teddy‚Äôs dismembered carcass in Cassie‚Äôs cabin. 

When I caught her gaze, the little girl didn‚Äôt look scared, and somehow, her fingers wrapped around the scalpel looked just right.

Like the little bitch knew exactly what she was doing.

‚ÄúHelloooo?‚Äù Harry‚Äôs voice was a hysterical giggle. ‚ÄúOlly, Olly, Oxen freeee!‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you in heeeeeeere?‚Äù Carmel joined in. I could hear their footsteps above, dancing across the room.

I grabbed a sleepy looking Rowan, dragging him down to sit next to me. 

""You okay?"" I whispered. 

He didn't respond for a moment, slack jawed.

""Rowan.""

The guy blinked and slowly turned to me. ""Hm? Oh, yeah, I'm fine.""

He yawned.

""Totally fine."" he mumbled. 

Clamping my hand over my mouth, I dragged my knees to my chest and prayed they weren‚Äôt smart enough to figure out we were right underneath them. 

Knowing the truth about them, though? I wasn‚Äôt counting on it.",2,1748225735.0,ByfelsDisciple,0,0.75,False

I was diagnosed Feb 2025. Opening pressure 35, ct scans shows all the goods, partially empty sella, bilateral transverse sinus stenosis and papilledema. Started Acetazolamide (diamox) 1000mg right away. Lost 10% body weight in 3 months and really changed my life around

After initial relief, pretty soon after I guess maybe 2 weeks post LP I started to get nervous that symptoms were same. For months I was still feeling so shitty but just got on with it.


However about 2-3 weeks ago I'd had enough. I knew something was wrong. I was absolutely SURE pressure had increased despite the medication, life style changes and weightloss. I felt the exact same (if not worse) pre diagnoses. I have been in and out of docs office with no resolution. Last week I had my bloods checked for electrolytes, kidney and liver. All NORMAL. I could of cried. I managed to get into the ophthalmologist 3 days ago for emergency eye check on paps and visual fields. All NORMAL. I did cry. What the hell is going on?!? Why am I so symptomatic and increasingly becoming more fatigued and unwell. 

Today I had an epiphany.... what if I'm hypo? 

What IF I'm hypo... can this be? Can I either have a slow leak from LP in feb? Or my medication is working too well that I now have low csf fluid? Or both? 

Has this happened to anyone? 

Here are some my symptoms old and new, exactly the same:

Headaches, sometimes worsen when standing, sometimes worsen when laying down but persistent.

Vertigo, feelings of the world moving while I am standing still

Hearing sensitive to certain tones or pitches.

Blurry, lagging vision, double vision. Peripheral blindspots 

Neck and shoulder pain

Nausea 

Muscle weakness and spasms.

in high school, i was happy. i had my friends, i had a boyfriend that was seriously my best friend, i had my routine of school, i was a great student who was well liked and i felt a real sense of community. my life was easy going and i laughed and laughed and was so happy. after high school every single one of my friends went to a big college, so i tried to too. except for my parents didnt have the money to pay for my schooling so i ended up dropping out because it was too expensive and the amount of debt i was going to be in taunted me. this was a really hard thing for me to do because in my hometown, almost everyone went to college. it was just what everyone did. i felt so embarrassed and lost. then, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me. i was at my parents house in my hometown so so lonely and the most depressed i have ever been in my life. those few months i think really changed me as a person. i am still grieving the person i was. i lost my spark for so long

Hello from your local cruise experts at Expedia Cruises in Norwalk! One of the questions we hear most often, especially from folks new to cruising or those looking to get the best value, is: ""What‚Äôs *actually* included in that cruise fare?"" It‚Äôs a fantastic question, because understanding this is key to planning a stress-free and amazing vacation. Cruising offers incredible value, and we're here to pull back the curtain and show you exactly what you get and what you might want to budget for separately. The commonality of this question highlights that the array of offerings and pricing structures in the cruise industry can sometimes seem complex. This complexity arises because cruise lines cater to a wide range of preferences and budgets, leading to different levels of inclusions. Our goal here is to demystify it all for you. ¬†

# II. The Fantastic Value: What Your Cruise Fare Typically Includes

Let's start with the great news! Your cruise fare bundles together so many essential (and fun!) parts of your vacation. Think of it as your floating resort where a lot of the ""must-haves"" are already taken care of. While specifics can vary a bit between cruise lines, here‚Äôs what you can generally expect to be covered:

# A. Your Comfortable Cabin: Your Home Away From Home

This is your private retreat for the duration of your cruise. Whether you choose a cozy inside cabin (perfect for those who plan to spend most of their time exploring the ship or ashore), an Oceanview with a picture window, a balcony to enjoy the sea breeze and private outdoor space, or a spacious suite for ultimate comfort, your accommodation cost is covered. This includes your bed (often configurable as two twins or a queen/king), a private bathroom with a shower, storage space for your belongings, and typically a dedicated cabin steward who services your room daily, ensuring it's clean and comfortable. While the cabin itself is part of the fare, it's good to be aware that choosing a specific cabin location or a higher category often involves different pricing tiers, and ""guaranteed cabins"" (where the cruise line assigns your specific room closer to sailing) might be priced differently than selecting your exact stateroom.¬†

# B. Delicious Dining: From Buffets to Elegant Main Dining Rooms

Get ready to eat well! Your fare includes a fantastic array of dining options, a major highlight for many cruisers. This almost always means meals in the ship's main dining room(s) ‚Äì often offering multi-course menus for breakfast, lunch, and dinner with assigned seating times or flexible dining options. You'll also find extensive buffets with a wide variety of international cuisines, carving stations, salad bars, and dessert sections, perfect for a more casual meal at any time of day. Many ships also include casual eateries like poolside grills serving burgers and hot dogs, pizzerias often open late, or cafes serving snacks and light meals throughout the day. You could genuinely go your entire cruise enjoying delicious, included food without spending an extra dime on dining! The variety and accessibility of these included options are a significant part of what makes cruising such a great value. ¬†

# C. Quench Your Thirst: Basic Beverages Included

You'll find a selection of complimentary beverages available, especially in the buffet areas and main dining rooms, to keep you refreshed throughout your voyage. This typically includes regular coffee, tea (hot and iced), tap water (which is perfectly safe and filtered onboard), and often some juices (like lemonade, fruit punch, or select options at breakfast).So, staying hydrated or enjoying a morning coffee or an afternoon tea won't cost you extra. The provision of these basic beverages ensures your essential hydration and simple refreshment needs are met without additional charges, though the range is intentionally limited, which naturally leads to the availability of more extensive beverage options for purchase or through packages. ¬†

# D. Dazzling Entertainment & Activities: Shows, Music, Pools, and More!

Cruises are packed with entertainment, and most of it is included in your fare, ensuring there's never a dull moment unless you want one!. Think Broadway-style production shows in state-of-the-art theaters, live music in various lounges (from piano bars to rock bands), comedy acts, and movies under the stars on a giant poolside screen. During the day, you'll find engaging activities like trivia contests, dance classes, cooking demonstrations, and informative port talks. Plus, you'll have free access to the ship‚Äôs pools, hot tubs, sundecks with loungers for soaking up the sun, and often well-equipped fitness centers with standard gym equipment. Some family-friendly ships even include amazing water parks, thrilling waterslides, rock-climbing walls, and mini-golf, all part of your fare. This wide array of included options means you can have a highly engaging and entertaining vacation without incurring extra costs for daily fun. ¬†

# E. Fun for the Kids: A Look at Onboard Children's Programs

Traveling with little ones or teens? Most major cruise lines offer fantastic, complimentary kids' and teens' clubs, supervised by trained staff. These programs are a huge draw for families, making cruises an excellent and often cost-effective family vacation choice. The clubs are typically divided by age group (e.g., ages 3-5, 6-8, 9-12, and teens 13-17) and offer a wide range of age-appropriate activities, games, arts and crafts, sports, video games, and themed events or parties. This gives children and teenagers a chance to have their own fun and make new friends in a safe environment, while parents can enjoy some well-deserved relaxation or adult-oriented activities. Daytime programs are generally included in your fare. However, it's common for late-night group babysitting (after a certain hour, like 10 PM) or in-cabin babysitting services (if offered) to have an additional hourly fee.¬†

# F. The Journey Itself: Seamless Travel to Multiple Destinations

And of course, a core part of your cruise fare is the transportation from one amazing port to another! You unpack once, and your floating hotel takes you to explore different cities, islands, or scenic coastlines. This incredible convenience is a hallmark of cruising and a fundamental component of its value. Imagine waking up in a new destination every few days without the hassle of re-packing, catching flights, or navigating unfamiliar train stations. This aspect alone makes cruising a uniquely relaxing way to see the world. ¬†

# III. Planning for Extras: Common Onboard Expenses to Consider

Now that you know about all the wonderful things included, let's talk about some of the common extras you might encounter. Being aware of these upfront helps you budget and decide what optional experiences you'd like to enjoy. Remember, these are typically *optional*, so you can tailor your spending to your preferences! Cruise lines have increasingly moved towards an ""unbundled"" fare structure for mainstream cruises, which allows for a lower entry price point but means many amenities that were once standard or part of packages are now optional add-ons. This model is key to their revenue strategy but also offers you more choice.

# A. Elevated Dining: Exploring Specialty Restaurants

While the included dining is excellent and offers plenty of variety, many ships also feature ""specialty"" or ""alternative"" restaurants designed to offer a more premium or unique culinary experience. These often provide a more intimate ambiance, specific cuisines (like a classic steakhouse, an authentic Italian trattoria, a vibrant sushi bar, a French bistro, or even a venue helmed by a celebrity chef), or a unique interactive dining concept. There's typically an extra charge for these, either a flat cover fee per person (e.g., $30-$60) or √† la carte pricing, similar to a restaurant on land. These are an upsell, providing an enhanced experience for those who wish to indulge or celebrate a special occasion. ¬†

# B. Cheers to Your Vacation: Alcoholic Drinks, Specialty Coffees & Sodas (and how beverage packages can help!)

This is a big one for many folks! Generally, alcoholic beverages (such as beer, wine by the glass or bottle, and cocktails), specialty coffees (like lattes, cappuccinos, and espressos from the coffee bar), sodas, and commercially bottled water are not included in the base fare of most mainstream cruises. You'll pay for these as you go, and they'll be charged to your onboard account. ¬†

**However, here's a great tip:** Most cruise lines offer beverage packages! These allow you to pay a set daily price for a wide range of drinks, often including sodas, premium coffees, bottled water, and various alcoholic options. If you plan on enjoying several of these beverages each day, a package can often save you money and adds a layer of convenience, making your vacation feel more ""all-inclusive"" by reducing the need to think about the cost of each drink. The development of these packages is a direct response to the exclusion of these popular items from the base fare, allowing cruise lines to monetize these high-demand items while offering a bundled value proposition. We at Expedia Cruises in Norwalk can help you analyze your drinking habits and the package details to figure out if one is right for you and which tier makes the most sense. ¬†

# C. Adventures Ashore: Understanding Shore Excursion Costs

When your ship docks in a port of call, you'll have the chance to explore the local culture, history, and natural beauty. Organized shore excursions ‚Äì which can be guided tours, specific activities like snorkeling or ziplining, or transportation to key sights ‚Äì booked through the cruise line come at an additional cost. These can range from relatively inexpensive walking tours or beach transfers to more elaborate, full-day adventures. You always have the option to explore independently (perhaps just wandering the port town or taking a local taxi) or book tours with third-party operators, which can sometimes be cheaper. However, booking through the cruise line offers convenience, a vetted experience, and, importantly, a guarantee that the ship will wait for you if your official tour is delayed. Shore excursions are a significant revenue area for cruise lines, and also a key part of the destination experience for many passengers. ¬†

# D. Showing Appreciation: How Gratuities Work

Cruise ship crew members, from your cabin steward and dining room servers to the many others working behind the scenes, work incredibly hard to make your vacation special and memorable. To recognize their dedicated service, most major cruise lines automatically add a daily gratuity or service charge to your onboard account for each guest. This system has largely replaced discretionary cash tipping for these core service roles. The amount varies by cruise line and sometimes by cabin category, but it's often around $15 to $20 per person, per day. These collected gratuities are then distributed among the service staff. ¬†

You can usually prepay these gratuities when you book your cruise, which many people prefer as it helps with budgeting and means one less item on your final onboard bill. While this is an automatic charge, you are, of course, still welcome to offer an additional cash tip directly to a crew member who has provided exceptionally outstanding service. Understanding this policy upfront helps avoid surprises and frames the charge as an appreciation for the comprehensive service provided. ¬†

# E. Staying Connected: Wi-Fi at Sea

In today's connected world, many of us want or need to stay in touch, check emails, post vacation photos on social media, or perhaps even stream a show. Internet access or Wi-Fi at sea is almost always an extra charge on mainstream cruise lines. It's a modern necessity for many, making it a reliable revenue source for the cruise lines. Cruise lines usually offer various packages based on usage needs (e.g., a social media package, a streaming package) or the number of devices you want to connect. Be prepared for speeds that can vary and may not be as fast as your home internet, and costs that are generally higher than on land due to the satellite technology involved. Some luxury lines might include basic Wi-Fi in their fare, but for most, plan on this being an add-on if you need to be online during your voyage.¬†

# F. Pamper Yourself: Spa Treatments and Salon Services

If you're looking to relax and rejuvenate with a massage, facial, body wrap, new hairstyle, or manicure, the onboard spa and salon services are available but come at an extra cost, similar to a land-based resort spa. These are professional services offered by trained therapists and stylists. A pro tip: look out for spa specials, especially on port days when many passengers are ashore, suggests you might find some good deals or bundled treatment offers! This is a luxury add-on, often promoted with such specials to fill appointment slots. ¬†

# G. Other Potential Costs: Casino, Bingo, Shopping, Laundry, Room Service Fees etc.

There are a few other things that might tempt your wallet onboard! If you enjoy a bit of a flutter, the casino is, of course, pay to play. Bingo games, a popular cruise activity, often have an entry fee for the cards, with cash or cruise credit prizes. The onboard shops selling souvenirs, logo wear, clothing, jewelry, duty-free liquor, and essentials are retail purchases, just like any store.¬†

While some ships might offer complimentary self-service laundry rooms (though you might pay for detergent), full laundry and dry-cleaning services provided by the ship's crew will have a charge per item or per bag. Regarding room service, while basic continental breakfast or a limited menu might be included, some cruise lines now charge a per-order service fee or have charges for certain menu items, particularly for late-night orders. It's always best to check the room service menu for any applicable fees. ¬†

H. Getting There: Flights & Transfers to the Port

Unless you're lucky enough to live within driving distance of your departure port, or if it's explicitly part of a special promotional package, your flights to and from the port city, and any transfers between the airport and the cruise terminal, are usually not included in your cruise fare. This is a significant pre-cruise cost that needs to be factored into your total vacation budget. We at Expedia Cruises in Norwalk can absolutely help you arrange flights and transfers as part of your overall vacation package, often with access to good rates and convenient scheduling. ¬†

# IV. Insider Tips from Your Expedia Cruises Norwalk Team: Maximizing Your Cruise Value

As your dedicated cruise consultants, we love sharing a few insider tips to help you get the absolute most value and enjoyment from your cruise vacation! Understanding the landscape of cruise offerings can truly enhance your experience.

# A. Decoding ""All-Inclusive"": What it Really Means in Cruising

You'll hear the term ""all-inclusive"" used frequently in travel, but in the cruise world, its meaning can vary significantly, and this is a major point of potential confusion for consumers. Mainstream cruise lines (like Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian Cruise Line) offer fantastic value with many inclusions like meals, accommodation, and entertainment, but they aren't typically ""all-inclusive"" in the way a land-based all-inclusive resort might be. You'll still have those potential extra costs for things like alcohol, specialty dining, Wi-Fi, and gratuities that we've discussed.¬†

However, luxury cruise line soften feature fares that are much closer to a truly all-inclusive model. These higher upfront fares frequently bundle in most, if not all, alcoholic beverages (including fine wines and spirits), all gratuities, Wi-Fi access, specialty dining, and sometimes even shore excursions in every port and roundtrip airfare. While the initial price tag is higher, there are fewer (if any) additional bills at the end of your cruise. This difference reflects distinct market strategies: mainstream lines aim for a lower entry price to attract a broader audience, relying on onboard spending, while luxury lines cater to a clientele preferring upfront clarity and comprehensive inclusions. We can help you compare these different styles to see which best fits your budget, travel style, and preferences. ¬†

# B. Smart Savers: Look for Promotions, Packages, and Loyalty Perks!

This is where working with us at Expedia Cruises in Norwalk really shines! Cruise lines are constantly offering promotions and special deals, especially during what's known in the industry as ""Wave Season"" (typically January through March), points out. These promotions can significantly enhance the value of your cruise and can include perks like free cabin upgrades, onboard spending money (which you can use for those extras!), included beverage or dining packages, reduced deposits, or even deals on third and fourth guests in a cabin. We stay on top of all these deals from all the cruise lines. ¬†

Furthermore, if you find you enjoy cruising and tend to sail with one particular line, their loyalty programs can offer excellent perks that accumulate with each cruise you take. Higher-tier members in these programs often enjoy benefits like complimentary laundry service, free or discounted Wi-Fi packages, invitations to exclusive parties or events onboard, priority boarding and disembarkation, and sometimes even cabin upgrades. These loyalty benefits can effectively make your cruise experience more inclusive over time. As your travel consultants, we can help you navigate these promotions and ensure you're leveraging any loyalty status you have. There have been instances where booking through an agent has resulted in significant savings and additional onboard credits.¬†

# C. The Suite Life: Added Benefits with Upgraded Accommodations

Booking a suite on a cruise ship often comes with a host of benefits that go far beyond just having more space. Suites can include a range of valuable perks like priority check-in, boarding, and disembarkation, dedicated butler or concierge service to handle your requests, exclusive access to certain lounges or private sundecks, and sometimes even reserved seating in theaters or priority reservations for specialty dining. Some cruise lines even bundle amenities like included specialty dining meals, complimentary beverage packages, or free Wi-Fi for suite guests. While the upfront cost for a suite is certainly higher than a standard cabin, the bundled amenities and enhanced service level can offer excellent value, particularly if those perks are important to your vacation experience. For some travelers, a suite can provide a more ""all-inclusive"" feel on a mainstream cruise line, bridging the gap to a luxury experience. ¬†

# V. Budgeting with Confidence: Why Knowing What's Included Matters

Understanding what your cruise fare covers and what it doesn't is the first step to budgeting confidently for your dream vacation. It allows you to compare different cruise lines and itineraries on a more ""apples-to-apples"" basis, looking at the total potential cost, not just the advertised headline price. When you know what to expect, there are no unwelcome surprises, only smooth sailing and pure enjoyment! This knowledge empowers you to make informed decisions that align with your budget and vacation desires.

# A. Comparing Cruise Lines and Offers Effectively

The cruise market is diverse, with each line offering a slightly different product and value proposition. One cruise might have a very attractive lower base fare but exclude many things you'd ultimately want to purchase onboard, potentially leading to a higher overall cost. Another might seem pricier initially but could include more of those items (like a drinks package promotion or onboard credit), making it a better deal in the end. Without a clear understanding of these nuances, direct price comparison can be misleading. We help you look at the complete picture, considering not just the fare but also the likely onboard expenses based on your preferences, to determine the true overall value. For instance, Royal Caribbean has moved towards including mandatory taxes, fees, and port expenses in their advertised price for clarity, a trend that helps in more straightforward comparisons. ¬†

1kviv3w,https://www.reddit.com/r/syrianrue/comments/1kviv3w/my_first_full_syrian_rue_trip/,My first full syrian rue trip,"This was 5-7d ago roughly, maybe less. I had chewed nearly half the bag of syrian rue seeds if not more and swallowed it.

It tasted like that disgusting coffee flavored mucinex syrup, which at first was tolerable before my body had associated it with the nausea. It felt dxm-like, that was probably the first thing I noticed, mostly the serotonin aspects. I found myself jaw clenching, feeling insanely dizzy and movement sensitive, getting drunk-like movement, nausea and droswiness, etc.

This was mellow at first, and I was still chewing the seeds throughout most of this. 
It started to feel more weird, alcohol-like, and disorientating. Nausea built up rapidly, and a strange increasingly psychedelic feel entered along with more dreaminess. 

Things looked significantly brighter and more colorful, and when I went outside to throw up I was practically blinded from the light by how bright everything was, but my vision was also extremely colorful to an almost disgusting cartoonish extent yet unimaginably beautiful. 

I threw up in the grass, which was neon lime green.  The visuals dramatically increased, and I began to feel like I was in a hyper realistic version of candyland. Things felt insanely nostalgic and my vision began to wobble, melt, and twist as pastel psychedelic swirling colors obscured my vision to the point I could barely see, like alcohol poisoning and 100ug LSD visually but without the tunnels and stuff. My vision was insanely blurry.

I was tripping unimaginably hard, barely able to walk. I continued throwing up for probably around 2 hours, maybe longer. When I was finally done throwing up I felt cleaner and more pure in some way, not religiously as Im athiest but rather both mentally and physically; despite the fact that I'd just previously felt as if my vomit was made of pure biohazardous toxins from how much Id poisoned myself with the rue.

I then went inside after I was done throwing up and had probably some of the best introspection I've ever experienced, but cannot describe other than it felt very space-like, magical and colorfully abyssal, however Id also went to a pitch black room at this point to get away from the light and clear my mind for the introspective thoughts.

That was most of the trip, after that I rapidly came down and was no longer introspecting nor strongly hallucinating, and felt worn out / drained as well as rapidly forgetting my introspection, which is typical for me with psychedelics.

1kvir9o,https://i.redd.it/zqxff6uy713f1.png,Gemini New Moon May 26th 2025 Horoscopes for all 12 Rising Signs based on Western Tropical Astrology using Whole Signs House System,"# Horoscopes by Rising Sign

These horoscopes are generated using the Whole Sign house system in Western Tropical Astrology. I highly recommend reading your rising sign first, though you may gain additional insight by reading your Sun and Moon signs as well.

Keep in mind, a horoscope is a high level overview of the energy based upon how it could impact your personal chart due to its house structure. Though I use examples on how the energy could play out, what happens with your life most likely will be different (but there could be a similarity in theme.)

The focus with these horoscopes is Gemini energy- communication, planning, socializing, thinking and a fresh start or perspective.

**Aries Rising:**

Knock, knock, it‚Äôs time to get to know your neighbors. This New Moon energy encourages you to make connections within your immediate environment. Chat with people in your community and brainstorm ideas for local improvement. If your neighborhood is dealing with a feral cat issue, reach out to your local TNR (Trap, Neuter, and Release) organization, or start one yourself. If water is being wasted on non-native grass lawns, consider advocating for native plants through your HOA or local government.

I know this next part can be sensitive, but if you‚Äôve had a strained relationship with a sibling, this New Moon offers an opportunity to approach things differently. It might come down to focusing on shared values instead of differences. It‚Äôs never too late to offer an olive branch. At worst, nothing changes, but at best, it could begin a journey toward healing.

**Taurus Rising:**

You tend to be deeply attuned to your values, but this New Moon may highlight the need for a tune-up in how you communicate around them. Pay close attention to the language you use when talking, or thinking, about money and personal resources. Are you speaking from a place of fear or worry? This transit invites you to shift your money mindset. If you don‚Äôt already have a budget, now is a good time to review your spending habits. And if you‚Äôre feeling dissatisfied with your current financial circumstances, give yourself permission to want more, without shame or guilt.

Have a conversation with your higher self and explore what might be holding you back. You may benefit from working on your solar plexus chakra to clear out blocks that are standing between you and a deeper sense of financial security. Keep in mind, too, that you could be holding on to things, physical or emotional, that no longer serve you and are getting in the way of what you truly desire.

**Gemini Rising:**

You‚Äôve been riding a wave of optimism for a while, and with this New Moon in your sign, you're likely sending lots of texts and catching up on the latest news. Just be mindful of your tone. Make sure your words are encouraging and lighthearted rather than critical or gossipy. This is your time to show the world who you are in a new light, highlighting the qualities that make you unique. If you haven‚Äôt updated your look recently, this is a great time to go for that haircut you've always wanted or add new or thrifted pieces to refresh your style.

You‚Äôre encouraged to spend time with friends and may even be asked to step into a role that helps your community. If you have the bandwidth, say yes. This is also a wonderful time to network, and if you're single, you might just meet someone special while you're out socializing. So get out there and let your light shine.

**Cancer Rising**

You‚Äôve been in a more introspective place over the past year, reflecting deeply and exploring your purpose through a spiritual lens. This New Moon asks you to take that internal wisdom and begin crafting a plan, one that allows you to continue your spiritual practice while also turning your attention toward financial growth.

If you've felt torn between the spiritual and material realms, remember that you‚Äôre here not only to help others but also to support yourself. As you move forward, don‚Äôt minimize your financial needs. The universe is both infinite and abundant, and you are part of that abundance. You can be grounded and spiritual. One does not exclude the other.

**Leo Rising:**

This New Moon could awaken your inner star as you step into new social roles. You may be considering joining a group that supports a cause you care about. You‚Äôre excited to meet new people, but don‚Äôt forget to nurture your existing friendships too. Share your ideas freely and be open to hearing different perspectives.

You may also feel called to explore through travel or learning. Consider signing up for a class you‚Äôve always wanted to take or planning a group trip that centers around meaningful conversation. Whether it's studying culture or dining with friends in a vacation-like setting, this is a time to broaden your mind and expand your horizons.

**Virgo Rising:**

You‚Äôve been shining professionally, and this New Moon supports you in continuing that upward momentum. Have conversations with colleagues or supervisors to plan your next steps. It's also a great time to join a professional organization or sign up for events that can help you grow in your career.

At the same time, don‚Äôt neglect what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes. Be sure your spiritual path and personal aspirations are in alignment with your deeper values. Seek peace and harmony, but not at the cost of your individuality. Ensure that you are investing in your financial future or at the least, saving for a rainy day.

**Libra Rising**

The one thing you truly need under this New Moon is a break. With everything you've been managing, you may have unintentionally put relationships on the back burner, especially with family, a partner, or your closest friend. Use this energy to take control of your schedule and intentionally carve out time to be with those you love, particularly as the summer holidays approach.

You'll also want to engage with friends, perhaps by attending a party or planning a group outing that brings laughter and connection. Just remember to make space for one-on-one time with your significant other. There‚Äôs likely something the two of you have been wanting to do for a while, and it doesn‚Äôt have to be complicated. Even something as simple as getting the kids a babysitter could help the two of you reconnect.

**Scorpio Rising:**

It‚Äôs time to confront your hidden patterns and create a plan to address old stories related to scarcity, control, and betrayal. You may have felt stuck, but this New Moon brings energy and mental clarity to help you purge a limiting mindset. Take control of your life, your finances, and your resources. Don‚Äôt shy away from important conversations about money, assets, or inheritance.

Reclaiming your sense of value and taking action in your career can help pull you out of the rut you've been in. While communication is important, so is following through on the promises you‚Äôve made to yourself. Establish a daily routine that honors both your time and your well-being. Embrace your talents and put them into action.

**Sagittarius Rising:**

With the New Moon in your seventh house, this is the time to clearly state what you want in your one-on-one relationships, and to own what you bring to them. Avoid overthinking. Your partner or close friend wants to hear how you feel, not just what you think. Balance asking questions with expressing your own point of view and aim for collaboration.

When it comes to shared activities, take the lead. This might feel like unfamiliar territory, but planning something fun or romantic could go a long way. Choose a unique restaurant from a culture you haven‚Äôt explored, and let the experience bring you closer through discovery and connection. Your adventurous spirit is what attracted your loved one to you, so engage in something fun.

**Capricorn Rising:**

This New Moon offers a fresh start for your routines. Reflect on what‚Äôs working and what isn‚Äôt, then make a plan. Even small changes can yield big results. If your sleep has been off, try adjusting your caffeine intake, maybe swap your second cup of coffee for decaf. Or, do a guided meditation before bedtime to relax and clear your mind.

You might also reflect on whether you‚Äôve been micromanaging yourself or slipping too far in the opposite direction. This is the moment to strike a healthier balance. If you're relying on automation in your daily tasks, make sure the systems still reflect your voice and style. For example, check your auto-replies to be sure they sound like you.

Health also means managing stress. Book a massage, take time to stretch, give yourself a facial, or simply relax on the couch with a good comedy. Let yourself recharge.

**Aquarius Rising:**

You‚Äôve had a flood of creative ideas this past year, but you may not have known how to bring them to life. With this New Moon in your fifth house, now is the time to capture your inspiration and start giving shape to your thoughts. Whether it‚Äôs painting, writing an outline, picking up an instrument, or sketching a product idea, start creating. Even asking deep questions or diving into research counts as creative expression.

If you're overwhelmed by too many ideas, try connecting with a partner or close friend. Talking things out can help you clarify your thoughts and move toward action. Most creatives thrive with a muse, and this is a great time to surround yourself with someone who inspires you. Your exchange with them can help you put everything into place so that you can move forward with your vision.

**Pisces Rising:**

Look around your home, does it reflect the sanctuary you‚Äôve always envisioned? If books are scattered and unfinished projects are piling up, this New Moon offers motivation to get organized. Clear your space, donate what you don‚Äôt use, and create a retreat that reflects your vision. Your energy is high, making this a great time to wrap up lingering projects or start new ones that transform your space into something special.

If your home is already in good shape, consider inviting loved ones over. A potluck or game night can bring warmth and joy without breaking the bank. People love being around you, and they feel appreciated when you reach out. If a full gathering feels like too much, simply invite someone for coffee and catch up on each other‚Äôs lives. Connecting with those who love you, especially your extended family, can give you that lift in spirit that you have been craving.",2,1748224185.0,astrologymemes,0,1.0,False

72 year old mom gave me a list she was given when she was 20 years old. The list contains foods she should not have been eating because of allergies, sickle cell, and things that, according to her doctor at the time, don‚Äôt agree with her body and gut.

BUT, after looking at the list‚Ä¶.what in the world can she eat? Air?

To be clear, she‚Äôs been eating lots of things on this list her whole life (mainly out of negligence and what not) and has always kinda been sickly. So now she realizes that avoiding these things can help. 

Moreover, recently she found out that she can‚Äôt eat anything fresh! Like vegetables or raw foods‚Ä¶if they are cooked down, she‚Äôs totally fine. Indian and Thai food seem to have no negative impact. 

Question is: does anyone in this group see some kind of food group or cuisine that she could possibly eat? For example, Indian and Thai are ok, but Japanese and of typical American diet cannot.

I‚Äôm probably not explaining it well, but‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôve seen a few of these posts but wanted to get some tailored advice.

**TLDR: did the golden route last time, seeking recommendations for relaxed yet active trip for family of 4 with two young kids (5 & 2)**

We did the golden route (plus a bit extra) in Japan Sept/Oct 2023 (Tokyo > Kanazawa > Takayama > Kyoto > Osaka) over 19 days with myself (while 26 weeks pregnant), my husband, and our 2.5 year old. We loved it and are contemplating returning next year. There will be 4 of us (myself, husband, 5 year old and 2 year old), planning to visit over March & April for 4 weeks.

**Things & places we loved:** 
- Tokyo: we stayed in Ebisu and loved the residential vibes!! I enjoyed Tokyo much more than I thought I would. We‚Äôd definitely return
- Kyoto: we stayed near-ish the Imperial Palace. We also loved the vibes, very different from Tokyo but the heritage buildings and walkability of the area we stayed was super cool. Would be open to returning. 
- overall we kept it fairly low key with a mix of touristy stuff and casual exploration of different areas. 
- incorporated kid-friendly activities and excursions to indoor play centres every other day to let the kids play and get energy out. 
- we were able to take advantage of the rail pass as it was the final days of the tourist prices. Not sure how that will impact our ability to travel by rail this time around!

**Didn‚Äôt love/wouldn‚Äôt return for:**
- Osaka: maybe it was because it was the last stop on our trip but we didn‚Äôt love Osaka. Felt it was busy and hectic but without the charm of Tokyo or Kyoto. Felt both overwhelming and underwhelming at the same time. 
- Kanazawa and Takayama: both neat places and we enjoyed our stays but don‚Äôt feel as strong a pull to return to.
- we definitely fell into the TikTok tourism‚Ñ¢Ô∏è trap with some of the recommendations, which was fine as it was our first time and we felt we had to see/do it all. Now that we‚Äôre returning we‚Äôre happy to go off the beaten track and be a bit more loose with our travels. 

**Options we‚Äôre considering:**
- We‚Äôd love to explore maybe north to Hokkaido as I‚Äôve seen recommended here
- love nerdy things like museums of metrology and measuring tools (my husband is a machinist and engineer), studio ghibli, etc
- access nature and hiking 
- visiting smaller cities, or something different to Tokyo, with perhaps a similar access to the history of the city like Kyoto
- good food and coffee (pretty much a given in Japan), and enjoying the varying local cuisines
- Would also consider a 1-2 day easy/moderate trek with the kids (but maybe best to wait until they‚Äôre a bit older?)
- I didn‚Äôt get to enjoy much sashimi/sushi or onsen activities since I was pregnant last time, would love to do more of that this time around

I don't toot my own horn very much, but as far as I know, I am the first one to identify this region as problematic in 2025. I posted about it in January, weeks before the crisis kicked off in earnest. I am going to explain why. First current events.

On Saturday May 24th a low thermal anomaly has been detected at the Santorini Caldera. This means that satellites are detected an elevated heat signature at the volcano. Despite all of the action back in February when the big earthquakes were striking, no thermal anomalies were detected making this one novel for this series of events. This anomaly coincides with a noisy seismograph and a recent comment by the EMSC last week stating the earthquakes currently occurring there, most of low magnitude, are volcanic. I am going to share the thermal anomalies and seismic data for today.

This does not mean an eruption is imminent by any means, as thermal anomalies pop up at volcanoes which are not erupting or active frequently. It's only significant in the greater context of what has been occurring there. It's also of low power at 3 MW. No cause for immediate alarm, and I am sharing the details with you because I want you to understand the stakes and see what I see. I try to find the hotspots early and this requires one to look at the data, which has a steep learning curve and I must admit that my experience is limited and I am not formally educated. 

Earlier I posted an update and part of it was noting that the EMSC is detecting a volcanic character to the low level seismic activity ongoing there in recent weeks. Here is the quote from [Euronews.com](http://Euronews.com) said by Remy Bossu, who is the Secretary General of the EMSC. The title of the article is Dont panic but be aware, experts advise tourists after earthquakes rattle Greece. 

*More unusual was the earthquake near the volcanic island of Santorini in February, which experienced intense seismic activity known as an ""earthquake swarm."" According to Bossu,* ***there was a clear volcanic element to the tremors.***

I am somewhat flabbergasted by the quote. There has been so much debate about whether the events are purely tectonic or whether the volcanoes are involved. I have not seen a quote like it anywhere else, and it's interesting that it would be said on an article telling tourists not to panic. Either way, it is a gem of a find and coming from the most credible of sources as a top level official in the European-Mediterranean Seismological Center and cannot be misinterpreted in any way shape or form. There was/is a clear volcanic element. So before I dig into this from a volcanic perspective, whether this does or doesn't have a volcanic component is likely beyond debate. 

I personally have been operating under the assumption the volcanoes are involved, so I will interpret this as confirmation. The distinction is huge. In a tectonic only paradigm, a bunch of M1-M3 earthquakes happening daily is interesting, but not concerning, as many tectonically active places see earthquake swarms. As a result, most people are not paying much attention to the region now that the big earthquakes have subsided near the volcanoes, although we have seen some big earthquakes to the south near Crete in recent weeks and Crete is relevant to what I am going to get into. However, if the seismic activity has a volcanic component, small earthquakes matter a great deal because they are signaling activity. To properly monitor a volcano, seismometers need to be installed very close and equipped to see very low frequency earthquakes and to see what is happening in higher resolution. We do have one high quality seismograph at Santorini by the GFZ, but it's focused on tectonic events mostly. 

In conclusion on the current events, there is a low thermal anomaly at the caldera and elevated background noise coinciding. Elevated background noise can happen at anytime and it's only relevant because it coincides with the thermal anomaly. Back on the 16th there was much more noise in the seismograph than we se currently. We don't know for sure there is a connection.

I have not shared my thoughts on the Mediterranean region in some time, but I think now is as good as any. However if you have been with me for a while you know that I can confidently claim that I was the first to point to this region in the last several months and say I think we have a problem. A few weeks later, the crisis got underway in earnest. That feeling was true, and the situation continues to evolve, but could have been a lucky guess I suppose. Again, no imminent eruption or anything, but I see a pattern here which merits concern in short and long term. I am going to tell you why, but we have to start from where this region initially caught my eye. Buckle up. 

The connections I am going to make are speculative on my part and anecdotal. In other words, it's how I see it, but it's beyond my capability to prove it. Everything I am going to describe did in fact happen, but my interpretation of them is subjective. With that said, I am no dummy, nor do I cry wolf for attention. I may still get things wrong, but my burden of proof isn't low. I do view natural science differently from the mainstream in my recognition that from time to time, regional and maybe even global catastrophes can and do occur. The volcanoes are implicated in just about every single one of them one way or another and I see evidence that they play a much bigger role in shaping conditions on this planet than we give them credit for, including helping to form the base of the food chain. It would only take one massive eruption to cause major problems for us. I am not even sure a Tambora style eruption wouldn't be catastrophic given how fragile our climate is becoming. I watch the volcanoes, not just for what they can do in the short term, but because they are the surface features of much deeper processes on our planet and likely have a bigger impact than we realize. Processes which we have little means to constrain, as they occur deep beneath our feet. You might need a cup of coffee because I have a long story to tell you. 

Last year in August/September there were two simultaneous fish kills in Volos Greece and Izmir Turkiye and since then local Fishermen continue to complain about the lack of fish in the region. Anthropogenic causes were ultimately declared to be the culprit, but I was skeptical. It was too severe, too widespread across the Aegean, and the causes they gave just didn't make much sense to me. I am not going to get into all the details, but you can see them on my previous post about it. [I wrote an entire paper about why I think we are totally sleeping on the volcanoes and their relationship with fish kills,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Disastro/comments/1i861b2/the_relationship_between_hydrothermal_systems_and/) and this region was the focus. I noted that similar fish kills have long been attributed to Campi Flegrei in Naples by the locals and that scientists had confirmed the validity of that hypothesis by measuring the geochemical output of the system. The relationship between harmful blooms of microorganisms and compounds related to volcanoes or heated sediment continues to come into focus with recent studies describing one of the most massive plankton blooms in deep water stemming from a Kilauea eruption in 2018 and Tonga 2022.

This suspicion, combined with seismic upticks and a regional SO2 anomaly already had me eyeing the volcanoes under the waves. I felt that if the volcanoes changed their geochemical output and/or temperature, it could cause a simultaneous fish kill reported in two regions hundreds of miles apart. Volcanoes and magma heating water and sediment in the crust both release chemicals into the water which are consumed by microorganisms causing the anoxic conditions and can alter geochemistry in their environments. If the two reports of fish kills are related, then the cause must be sufficient to explain both of them, and I am not sure what else could beyond a purely random coincidence involving anthropogenic sources as was reported by authorities. However, knowing what we know now, that there is a lot of geological activity going on there, a geological cause for the fish kills does not sound as preposterous as it did before the earthquakes and volcanic tremors started in earnest. I really worried about how that article would be received because the connection I was making was bold and I wrote it before knowing a major seismo-volcanic crisis would be hitting front page news in a matter of weeks from the time of writing. However, just to be clear, the fish kill happened in late August 2024 and I wrote the article in January 2025. It's known that volcanoes often follow a progression and the gas often comes first. All things considered, it makes me think this has been brewing for longer than we think. 

On the first day of 2025, I witnessed the mother of all SO2 (volcanic gas) anomalies, and have never seen anything like it since or before. When you watch SO2 every day, and see various things happen like eruptions, manmade activity, and degassing or tectonic releases, you get an idea for scale. Every volcano is different, and more than a few don't emit much SO2 in general and are CO2 rich instead. Sometimes a single volcano will produce an SO2 rich eruption and then another without much at all. Big eruptions cause large red patches. Anthropogenic activity is generally local and not severe in most places, but there are exceptions. Degassing events can sometimes produce more SO2 than an actual eruption, although not usually. However, for over 3/4 of the worlds volcanic regions to simultaneously undergo major degassing, that is extremely unusual. The video below of the anomaly shows what a normal day of SO2 looks like without any significant anomalies. 

I thought it was a data glitch, but figured if it was, it would eventually get corrected. However, that isn't what happened. It ran its course completely until dissipated. My definition of SO2 anomaly is a strong non anthropogenic volcanic gas concentration in a noteworthy location. Kilauea has been producing huge SO2 plumes, but that is expected with its current eruptive activity, therefore not an anomaly in this sense. Dormant volcanoes, traditionally non volcanic regions, regions which are experiencing significant volcanic unrest, or the polar regions are generally what I am looking for. What I saw is unexplainable by any existing conventional theory.

https://reddit.com/link/1kvicpi/video/g6bhceoa8t2f1/player



Assuming this is not bad data, and I don't think that it is, what does it tell us? Well there weren't any noteworthy eruptions from the vast majority of the regions affected, so automatically we are looking at degassing. Volcanic regions all through the Pacific, India, Africa, Central America and the Caribbean are showing major anomalies on par with that of strong SO2 rich eruptions like Iceland and Shiveluch. Meanwhile both polar regions are showing weaker anomalies with the north pole already coated in SO2 and localized emergent plumes in the southern polar region. The volcanic gas signatures across a vast area of the globe appeared in a very short time window with an east to west progression focused on the equatorial region. Must take into consideration the satellite images are 24 hours apart so 36-48 hours is the longest it could possibly take for it to appear but it could be quicker too, that is just the max. 

These volcanoes don't share plumbing. There is no conventional reason why or how they would all do this at the same time. What could link them all? Since its near global in extent, we need a near global instigator and I do not know what it is. I do note that the time it appeared, we were experiencing a severe G4 geomagnetic storm. I have not witnessed any similar anomalies associated with space weather, including during a brief G4 in April, but that wasn't a very powerful storm. I also note something else very peculiar in regards to space weather preceding the SO2 anomaly. 10 MeV high energy protons were elevated for over a week straight leading up to the geomagnetic storm stemming from a far side solar eruption. A normal proton event has a sharper rise and a faster decline back to background. In this case, they rose halfway to minor radiation storm levels for several days, and you can see the anomaly extends prior to December 24th. I am not saying definitively there is a link. All I am saying is at the same time the volcanic gas anomaly popped up, we were experiencing a low level MeV proton event and a severe geomagnetic storm unfolded around the time of SO2 onset and all events were noted.

After the major SO2 anomaly, I would notice several more in the following months in other places. Next is the Aegean Anomaly that happened on 1/22/2025 which partially influenced me to write the fish kill article.

https://reddit.com/link/1kvicpi/video/95lca00s8t2f1/player

I want you to also note the very strong SO anomaly that pops up near Spain and Portugal. One would logically think it came from the Azores, known for an anomaly or two from time to time, but there is a strong pressure system over them and it looks like the plume gets sucked up after from the outside. Still could be from the Azores, but I am not ruling out Spain itself based on how it manifests nearby. It's unrelated to this article, but noteworthy on its own. 

Our main focus for this post is the Aegean. It was upon seeing the Aegean anomaly that I wrote the post about the fish kills. I considered it to be potentially supporting evidence. I had already suspected that tectonic or volcanic activity had caused the fish kill, but seeing a strong volcanic gas anomaly pop up in the region in focus gave me the confidence to write it up and share with you. 

There had been a small uptick in earthquakes around this time. It had caught my attention, but wasn't anything super unusual. Greece had been fairly quiet for a while and a return to seismic activity isn't too unusual by itself. Its a complex geological region. However, shortly after writing the fish kill article, the big earthquakes came. The frequency and magnitudes caught the attention of the entire geophysical community. There was debate about whether they were purely tectonic or had a volcanic component. I was already of the mind there was a volcanic component, but I understand that I don't have final say on such things and there are professionals who do this for a living instead of just a side project. Nevertheless, I operated under the assumption volcanoes were involved, and with high confidence, but not certainty. Then this happened on 2/13/2025.

https://preview.redd.it/asrnmxt8oz2f1.png?width=1005&format=png&auto=webp&s=10f356b5dbdf9310b42550d7264103912bf71612

There is no mistaking what the seismograph data in the black box is saying. Its a long period volcanic tremor. Earthquakes like this involve fluid or magma movement and are not really observed outside of volcanic settings. I circled a typical earthquake in the upper right for comparison. It was at this point that it became very difficult to deny the volcanoes were involved to some extent. For me it came as confirmation. 

Months have went by since then, and the region has somewhat left the focus of many because the earthquake magnitudes came down. Since there are not regular M4+ earthquakes happening daily, it had fell back into obscurity for most. This would be logical if the situation was purely tectonic, but its not. In a volcanic setting, the smaller earthquakes are every bit as important as the big ones. As noted, it is a complex geological setting, and while there is a definite volcanic component, there is a tectonic one as well. It has a hybrid feel to it. There are still daily quake swarms near Santorini and Kolombo volcano and I monitor them closely. 

Next we talk about Crete. Prior to the big earthquakes over the last week or so, [residents were alarmed at two 150 meter fissures](https://greekreporter.com/2025/04/28/cracks-geological-mystery-alarms-crete-village/) which opened up parallel to one another and were not associated with an earthquake. They just appeared one day. This can happen in aseismic faults, but its still very unusual. The manner in which the fissures appeared seems to suggest there is significant stress in the region. Now we are seeing the bigger earthquakes and they may be sharing the same stress. It's also noteworthy that even though the earthquakes slowed down at Santorini, they are popping up all over the Greek Isles, including at Methana, Sousaki, and Nisyros volcanoes. There are also more earthquakes inland in Greece. 

All of these signs suggest significant stress is occurring. Right now the effects are latent. It hasn't led to any significant disaster or catastrophe at this point. What is the stress? I don't know. If we had real time and high resolution data for uplift and subsidence, we may have a better idea, but we don't and much of the region is undersea. It should be noted that Santorini experienced a significant episode of unrest in the early 2010s. That alone tells us that whatever is happening, is pretty long term. It didn't just start last year, even though it clearly accelerated. That episode did not lead to anything major and its quite possible that this one wont either. We could see another pause, only to resume later, or not resume at all. 

There is a great deal of uncertainty. This is even more so for me because I operate under a different framework than mainstream where I am less inhibited by arbitrary limits on what the planet can and cannot do. My research indicates this region suffered a great catastrophe only 36 centuries ago. You will note the name on the GFZ seismograph is Thera. Before it was the Greek isle of Santorini, it was known as Thera. It caused widespread devastation and is inextricably linked to the downfall of several civilizations in the region, most notably the Minoans on Crete and is known as the Minoan eruption. It was also probably recorded by the Egyptians on the Tempest Stele too.

Beyond completely devastating the immediate area, its thought that its effects were global based on Chinese records describing a volcanic winter. That is what is known in mainstream archaeology, but outside of the mainstream, there are other links to events around this time which are beyond the scope of this article. However, I will say that in my mind this has absolutely no connection to the story of Atlantis, as is often suggested. That is another matter entirely. The story of Atlantis primarily originates with Plato, and he dated that event to the close of the ice age around 10K years before his time. 

It should also be noted that following the equatorial SO2 anomaly which seems primarily centered over Africa, several other dynamic geological regions have exhibited divergence from previous trends. The Campi Flegrei caldera is showing elevated unrest on a similar timeline as Santorini, although that situation too has been brewing for decades. The Ethiopian volcanic crisis kicked into high gear and one of the largest magma intrusions ever documented occurred. However, it too has an earlier genesis with significant unrest episodes in 2011, which is coincidentally the same time as the first episode of unrest near Santorini. This is another issue that has found its way to the back burner as the big earthquakes have subsided. However, I am noting near daily thermal anomalies at Dofen volcano and anomalous seismic activity continues, although is not well monitored or reported. It's quite interesting that both Santorini and Ethiopia both exhibited significant episodes of unrest both currently and in 2011. 

All of these systems are affected by the African plate. Its currently thought that there is a mantle plume rising underneath it and is driving a lot of the geological activity such as the East African Rift and subduction zones in the Mediterranean. Furthermore, there is something else underneath the African plate called the large low shear velocity province (LLSVP). This massive structure at the core mantle boundary still confounds us. We don't know how it got there or what it is made of. We just know that its hotter and more conductive than the surroundings. Its also implicated in the secular variation of the magnetic field. It gets more interesting because there is another LLSVP and it is located in the Pacific. Right where the first half of the equatorial SO2 anomaly appeared. 

In closing, I want to reiterate a few things. The first is there is no sign of an imminent eruption from Santorini or Kolombo. If one were to take place, we would presumably see additional warning signs. I say additional, because we are already seeing warning signs in volcanic earthquakes, ground deformation, potential gas output changes & SO2 anomalies, and now a thermal anomaly. It should be noted that most of the seismic activity was not occurring directly at Santorini, but the underwater volcano to the NE Kolombo. We can't see thermal anomalies there. As a result, we cant assume it has or hasn't had any. Its a wildcard. We can only look at the data we have, and in my case, what is publicly available. 

Nevertheless, I see reason for concern just based on those local characteristics alone. Any connection to the SO2 anomaly I reported is speculative on my part. I am telling you all of this so you can see it from my perspective. You may be wondering why nobody else has reported the major SO2 anomalies I reference and in some ways, I wonder that as well. However, I can't base my opinion of anything other than what I personally see. I monitor all parameters available to me daily. Everything I reported did in fact happen, but the connections I make are anecdotal. I am describing a sequence of events which should have no relationship in conventional theory, but I am not a conventional theorist. I pointed to this location as one to watch well before anyone else did. Assuming it was not a lucky guess, I am inclined to think I am on to something. This situation could pause, as it did in 2011, only to return later. As to what it will eventually end up being, only time can tell. I take it one day at a time and trust my intuition & powers of reason.

\-Trader Joes for specifically half gallon whole milk. 

\-Costco for specifically Starbucks brand coffee beans, no exception!

\-A family owned coffee shop for spcifically their coffee beans.

I thought I lucked out since these locations happened to be close to each other, even if it was downtown close to rush hour. I decide to go to the coffee shop first since some family owned businesses close earlier on Sundays. I did not know that a huge festival was being held. Many streets were closed, and the foot traffic was immense. Once I figured that getting coffee was a lost cause since the street it's on is closed, I go to the Costco. This takes 90 minutes total. At Costco I find out they stopped selling Starbucks coffee. Not only that they stopped their coffee grind service (I was requested to grind exactly half of the beans). At this time my mom calls again. She wants roasted duck from the butcher across the city. I have to skip Trader Joes to make it on time, as Costco sells milk that is too large.

To sum it up, I failed to get any of the items so far, and am deep in actual rush hour on the freeway 30 minutes before the butcher shop closes. It has been 2 hours. It also shouldn't come as a surprise that since it's the end of the bushiness day for them, they are out of roast duck. They only have a single chicken left which I buy.

1kvi5ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/IVF/comments/1kvi5ex/need_hope_tips_for_fet_2/,Need hope & tips for FET #2,"My first (32F, 32M) FET totally failed to implant in April, it was a hatching 4AA as perfect as it could be embryo. I had done accupunture, given up caffeine leading up to the transfer. 

For my second, I advocated with my RE to do something different. I had already been diagnosed with adenomyosis which was one of the reasons we decided to do IVF (have never seen a positive test in my life) 
My RE agreed, we did a laproscopy+ hysteroscopy+ biopsy and i am so glad I advocated for myself because they did end up finding Endo, stage 2 which was excised. Everything else looks good, no polyps, no high NK cells. My RPL panel looks OK too

So now I am gearing up for my second FET, which is a modified natural cycle. My RE prescribed me Letrozole this time around because it took me forever to ovulate the last FET (she has also diagnosed me with mild PCOS)

My embryos are not tested, it's not common to test embryos here in Australia. The next embryo to be transferred will be a 4AA as well 

What I am doing different this cycle:
- no accupunture (ran out of budget) 
- have been on an anti inflammatory diet (no gluten, no dairy & mostly plant based/whole foods diet) 
- one cup of coffee a day (max) 
- RE told me I can take 100 mg aspirin from day of transfer (I wasn't asked to take this for FET 1) 
- RE has also prescribed me antibiotics to take 2 days before transfer to combat any inflammation 
- added a probiotic supplement l. rhamnosus
- taking prenatals, vitamin e, coq10, Omega 3, vit d, l Argenine 
- lots of walks & light yoga 

I am clearly grasping at straws at this point, I would love to hear from anyone who has had a transfer failed & what did they do or not do to make the next transfer successful. It's been SO hard to be hopeful along this journey üòû",4,1748222187.0,IVF,8,1.0,False
