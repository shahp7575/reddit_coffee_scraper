My biggest issue is around the weeks before, during, and continuing into now is something new as far as symptoms go, which is I simply cannot stay awake. I‚Äôm up for around 4-6 hours, then sleep, wake up, continue. This is playing hell on the hours I need to be awake for, which is prime-time EST timings. Instead, I‚Äôm asleep every evening and morning, awake briefly in the afternoon, then again at around 1:00 AM.

And it‚Äôs a strong sleep urge too; normally I can fight it off with coffee or pop, but this is less than 10 minutes of warning and I‚Äôm out like a light. 

This is more ‚Äúinconvenient‚Äù than bad, really, as I‚Äôm not working. But I‚Äôm missing when my friends are awake, and I‚Äôm waking up so tired I could nap immediately after. Weirdly, in a way, I do feel‚Ä¶better, ish, for the extra sleep. But not enough to meaningfully do anything. 

I‚Äôve had a sleep study done with no conclusive results. And going to the emergency is right out, as my emergency room in Canada often is either overloaded or closed, and lacks the ability to help me short term anyways. I‚Äôll bring it up with my clinic next I see them, but I‚Äôm not sure what to even bring up with them?

Narcolepsy seems to be ‚Äútoo serious‚Äù to be what this is, and I don‚Äôt necessarily want to collect diagnoses like Pokemon cards. But is there anything I should be looking into? Tips to stay awake?",1,1761534528.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

Context: I‚Äôve been seeing these Outin portable espresso ads all over Insta and TikTok. Dismissed it as more marketing fluff since the standard bundle only has a tiny pressurised basket (5g-6g of grounds) and a pod attachment for capsules.

I was tired of people peeking at my screen in coffee shops or on the train/plane? So I took matter in my own hands and I just dropped the beta for iSee, a super lightweight macOS menu bar app that uses your MacBook's camera to alert you the instant an unauthorized person is looking over your shoulder.



Why only for Mac?  
I wanted to learn Swift by making something cool and plus wanted to unleash by urge to perform vibe coding üòÖ and plus which could help me connect with other developers who love making apps for Mac and iPhone why? its fun to explore new things and learn from different folks in the same field.üòÉü•≥



The best part? It's built with a privacy-first approach: it's 100% open source and runs all detection on your device-zero data ever leaves your Mac.

So if there is any contributors or developers and could provide a honest feedback for the app it would really mean a lot as I want to make it free and open source for ever if possible which currently it is.



‚ú® Key Features in iSee's Beta V1.0.0:

üëÅÔ∏è Real-Time Detection: Instant alerts using Apple's Vision framework.

üö® Long-Term Threat Detection: The menu bar icon turns red if the shoulder surfer persists for over a minute.

üíª Dynamic Island Magic: It integrates beautifully into your MacBook's notch area, showing the camera feed there with liquid-smooth, matte-black animations. It looks native!

üîí Pure Privacy: Zero data collection and on-device processing guarantee your confidentiality.

üé® Clean Interface: Minimal menu bar integration and auto-dismissing notification overlays.



So do give it a try and let me know your feedback! The universal DMG is available on the releases page.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Philadelphia 76ers vs. Orlando Magic: A Tale of Two (Unreliable) Offenses**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of contradictions: the **Philadelphia 76ers**, a team with a 2-0 start but an offense that‚Äôs slower than a snail in a marathon, host the **Orlando Magic**, a squad that‚Äôs 1-2 but somehow even more likely to shoot a 3-pointer than make one. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a stat head and the wit of a late-night host.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who‚Äôs the Real Favorite?

The odds are as clear as a postgame press conference without a mic. The **Magic** are the slight favorites, with implied probabilities hovering around **60%** (thanks to decimal odds like 1.6), while the **76ers** sit at roughly **40%** (decimal odds \~2.4). The spread is a tight **-3.5 for Orlando**, suggesting bookmakers expect a narrow Magic victory. But here‚Äôs the twist: Philadelphia‚Äôs defense is so porous, they‚Äôd let a toddler in a wheelchair score 20 points. Last season, they allowed **115.8 points per game** (21st in the NBA), and Orlando‚Äôs offense? Well, they shot **31.8% from deep last season**‚Äîwhich is about the same chance I have of napping without my coffee.

### News Digest: Injuries, Ankle-Breakers, and a Coach‚Äôs Plea

**Philadelphia‚Äôs** key injuries: **Paul George** (knee) and **Jared McCain** (thumb) are out, while **Trendon Watford** (hamstring) is day-to-day. But hey, the 76ers have thrived without George so far‚ÄîTyrese Maxey‚Äôs been a scoring machine (28 points in their last game), and Joel Embiid‚Äôs been efficient, even if his shot selection sometimes resembles a dartboard.

**Orlando‚Äôs** woes are more dire. **Jalen Suggs** and **Moritz Wagner** are day-to-day with knee issues, which is tragic because Suggs is the only Magic player who can dribble without looking like a penguin on a trampoline. Their latest loss to the Bulls? A masterclass in inefficiency: **12.5% from 3-point range**, **20 turnovers**, and a coach,

I would say I am quite attractive, my friends will compliment me, my mother is kind and compliments me a lot which I guess is why sometimes I doubt my beauty because it is from biased people. It's not like I've never been hit on but its definitely not frequent and dated two people but when I am single It feels like guys might think I'm attractive but that there's some one that's prettier and that they'd rather try talking it up with them. Especially for some more context is I am a commuter at a community college by where I live and so I only go out to bars and stuff when i see my friends at school. I am social though and I still do things in my city going to coffee shops and dinners with friends but even if I look nice I just feel like I still won't get approached. Then my mind spirals with thinking egotistical thoughts like ""maybe I look intimidating"" or ""maybe I look that good where they are nervous to approach"" idk and perhaps I don't have the most approachable resting face (RBF mixed with looking sad LOL but then I have a big smile if someone talks to me) but yeah, I really don't know what more to say is that I would like to get hit on more because I refuse to download a dating app again, I want to meet people the old school way.

Also if there are guys reading this, sometimes I am hesitant to ask a guy for their number because if it wasn't there intention I feel like taking incitive gets lost, so let me know if I am making stuff up and that guys who are interested from a girl asking for their number usually takes control.

1oh3rj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1oh3rj5/am_i_cooked_in_dating_30_yo_m/,Am I cooked in dating. 30 yo M,"TL;DR:
30M ‚Äî pediatric nurse, construction business owner, immigrant with no family in the U.S. Six years of dating, 50+ first dates, 80% rejection. Tried everything: clothes, confidence, hobbies, date variety, self-improvement. Always get told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre great, just no spark.‚Äù Confidence is shot. Wondering if I should keep trying or accept that maybe I‚Äôm not meant for this and build a life on my own. I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs out there for you‚Äù for a decade, but reality hasn‚Äôt matched that line.

‚∏ª

Hey everyone,
I‚Äôm honestly confused about why dating has been so hard and wondering if anyone else is going through something similar.

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old pediatric nurse and construction business owner. I‚Äôve been actively dating for 6 years, mostly through Hinge, and I‚Äôve had over 50 first-date fails. About 80% of the time I get rejected, and I‚Äôve rejected the other 20% (mostly because people didn‚Äôt look like their pictures).

I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 155 lbs, fairly athletic, social, and yeah ‚Äî a little weird, but I own it. I love outdoor and extreme sports. I‚Äôm not a model, but not unattractive either. I‚Äôve felt mutual physical attraction plenty of times.

I‚Äôm also an immigrant from Europe with no family in the U.S., so finding a partner has always felt like something more than just romance ‚Äî it‚Äôs about building a life and a sense of belonging.

The biggest issue seems to be confidence. After so many rejections, mine‚Äôs basically wrecked. I can fake it at first, but eventually it cracks and the girl usually gets ‚Äúthe ick.‚Äù I‚Äôve even asked what went wrong after dates, and the answer is almost always the same:

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre great, I just didn‚Äôt feel a spark.‚Äù

I‚Äôve genuinely tried everything I can think of:
	‚Ä¢	Upgrading my style and grooming
	‚Ä¢	Learning to dance
	‚Ä¢	Planning different kinds of dates (walks, climbing, haunted houses, ice skating, coffee, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Paying for everything
	‚Ä¢	taking things slow or being more quick to intimacy 
	‚Ä¢	Improving my conversation flow, dating YouTube videos 

Some girls have literally described their ‚Äúideal guy‚Äù and it sounded like me. I‚Äôve also been told I look better in person than in pictures. Still ‚Äî nothing sticks.

I‚Äôve started to wonder if it‚Äôs just my personality. I can be hyper and intense, and while I try to dial it back, it eventually comes through. Being ‚Äúfully myself‚Äù hasn‚Äôt worked. Im more of an anxious attachment style person aswell.

My standards aren‚Äôt crazy ‚Äî someone active, physically fit(ish), ideally a bit shorter than me. But after years of trying, I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúsomeone‚Äôs out there for you‚Äù more times than I can count‚Ä¶ and a decade later, I‚Äôm still alone.

At this point, I‚Äôm asking:
Do I keep trying? Change something major? Get a coach? Or accept that maybe I‚Äôm not cut out for relationships? I‚Äôve seen what happens to lonely single men as they age, and honestly I‚Äôd rather die climbing or paragliding than live that kind of isolated, bitter life.

Any real advice would be appreciated.
I just want to know if all the effort I‚Äôm putting into dating is actually worth it ‚Äî or if after this much rejection, I‚Äôm basically cooked. I don‚Äôt want to give up, but if the reality is that I‚Äôm not built for this or it‚Äôs just not going to happen, then I‚Äôd rather stop trying to shape my life around the idea of a relationship.

If that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôll focus on building a life for me, my dog, and the outdoors ‚Äî something that doesn‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm constantly failing at something I can‚Äôt win. It‚Äôs not what I hoped for, but maybe it‚Äôs the hand I‚Äôve been dealt.",1,1761534303.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1oh3rhf,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1oh3rhf/visiting_china_with_a_9_month_old_a_recap/,Visiting China with a 9 month old: a recap,"We just got back from 16 days of vacation in china with our 9 month old and loved the trip! Wanted to give a rundown of details for other parents looking to vacation. 

Cities visited: Beijing ‚Äî> Xi‚Äôan ‚Äî> Chengdu ‚Äî> Chongqing ‚Äî> Shanghai (one night)

Our general days looked like early hotel breakfast, walking and excursions with kiddo taking a nap in the carrier from 10-11:30ish, lunch, more touring, back to the hotel for second nap from 3-4:30, evening touring and dinner, baby bedtime routine and then audiobooks and hotel amenities til adult bedtime. It‚Äôs humbling how much less you can do while traveling with a baby, but all of it was magical and we still got about 20k steps and 8ish hours of touring/travel per day.

General tips:
- I‚Äôll leave details on apps, vpns, esims etc to those who are more experienced than us. We pretty exclusively relied on Alipay and Amap (with an occasion WeChat assist) the entire trip and it works great.
- If you‚Äôre looking for baby care products (wipes, diapers, etc), most bougier malls will have a store that has those somewhere (goodbaby, large grocery stores, purcotton in a pinch). You also can search ‚Äúmaternal and baby‚Äù on Amap 
- If you rely on a stroller, make sure it‚Äôs one you can lift easily. While some city areas have a lot of accessible entrances and ramps, many don‚Äôt (and rarely, even subway entrances don‚Äôt). So be ready to fold and lift.
- For cars, book DiDi premium to avoid the cigarette smell you‚Äôll likely find in a standard DiDi.
- We avoided tour groups and are very thankful we did. I‚Äôve never been a fan but with a kid we COULD NOT be on someone else‚Äôs schedule. Being able to leave/stop to nurse/just sit down at any point was necessary.

Hotels: our general thought for hotels is GET A NICE ONE if you‚Äôre with a baby. You‚Äôll need the comfortable space for relaxation, naps, and comfort. And you‚Äôll want to spend the extra money to not have a place that smells like smoke. We didn‚Äôt used to be breakfast people before having our son, but we almost always used the morning breakfast at places because our kiddo is a BIG EATER and needed a big meal to start the day. 

- Beijing Chao Sanlitun: Super nice, the beds were so damn comfortable and they gave us a free upgrade to the room. It had the best food on the trip and I looked forward to breakfast every morning.

- Xi‚Äôan Canopy Hilton: The location is phenomenal, truly out of this world. Best location of the trip. The breakfast is good but a comedown after Beijing. Offered us a free stroller. 

- Chengdu Upper House (FKA Temple House): we felt like we were in a white lotus, which was‚Ä¶ an experience. It was probably the best hotel I‚Äôve stayed in my life and maybe best I‚Äôll ever stay in. Ridiculous location, insanely nice room and amenities (oatly in the minibar???) Truly, outrageously nice. The food wasn‚Äôt quite as good as I‚Äôd expect though! Offered us a free stroller and crib. 

- Chongqing Niccolo: Get a room with a view!!! It‚Äôs outrageous! We were in a room with the river view and we‚Äôd just sit there at night staring at the city. It was insane. Also, the breakfast was the closest to being as good as Beijing. Offered us a free stroller and crib. 

- Shanghai Banyan tree on the Bund: maybe the nicest room (tied with Chengdu) but there was a vague cigarette smell. A shame, but it was only for a night. This would be an amazing place to stay as a couple I think! It‚Äôs super romantic, had a lovely spa, and the giant jacuzzi tub is amazing (also fun for the kiddo).

 City review:

Beijing: So much to see and do here! We carried our kid the whole time and are glad we did, there were too many old roads and stairs for us to want to use a stroller. We did the Mutianyu Great Wall by booking a DiDi to and from and had a really nice time. Go early though! It started absolutely filling up by the time we left lunch. We also did the forbidden city and it was an insane experience, albeit a bit rushed from our son getting some sensory overload near the end. I had the most fun here the day we did a bit of a self led walking tour from the lama Temple all the way to Jingshan park (like 30k steps, be warne!). There were so many fun temples, the imperial college, beautiful quiet streets, and parks on the way. My husband really loved wandering the hutongs.

Xi‚Äôan: staying in the Everbright City really colored our experience and we loved it. The Muslim quarter was my husbands favorite experience in China, and the food in Xi‚Äôan was my favorite of the trip. It was a pretty flat and easy with a stroller, and we really enjoyed climbing some of the towers and visiting old temples and the parks here. Our son loved the shows at Tang Paradise!

Chengdu (note- my husband was sick day two): despite the illness, this was our favorite city of the trip. We love casual wandering of beautiful neighborhoods, and Chengdu has that in excess. The Yulin and Fangcao neighborhoods were beautiful. It felt similar to wandering west Tokyo, slow placed, lovely, hanging out with kids who tried to teach our kid Chinese and drinking coffee in nice cafes. We didn‚Äôt see the pandas because that was our day two plan. We also loved the peoples park and surrounding areas. This city was super child friendly, the hot pot was amazing, I would definitely go back

Chongqing: (note- kiddo got sick day two) stunning city. If you‚Äôre comfortable carrying your kid around (It‚Äôs a VERY vertical city), Chongqing is so much fun! We were all mesmerized by the architecture and lights and we had amazing food here. I loved Xiahaoli in the morning, and we all really loved the night we stayed up and walked across the bridge to see Hongyadong (tip, start from the top and walk on the walkways in Daijia Alley to get a view of the area from above, then walk across the bridge away from Hongyadong bridge to get the bridge views, then get on the subway at grand Theater. Avoid the MASSIVE crowd at the bottom of the area)

Shanghai: I don‚Äôt feel like I can give a review since we were only here for a day! But it felt the most ‚Äúwestern‚Äù of any cities we were in. 

‚ÄúMistakes‚Äù: some of these were outside our control. 

- We got sick on the second leg of the trip in sequence and it severely limited what we were up to do in Chengdu and Chongqing and I wish we could‚Äôve seen and done more. Not a mistake, just unfortunate timing
- We were locked out of a lot of Chinese apps (delivery apps, food apps etc) because of our lack of Chinese number. Our phones are locked and not paid off so this wasn‚Äôt an options
- Bringing a portable car seat. I‚Äôm torn on this one. It was nice to have for some long DiDi rides, but we ended up not using it all the time and people in china don‚Äôt seem to use them really ever. Plus lugging it on trains SUCKED. But we saw multiple car crashes on the second half of our trip and started thinking ‚Äúthank god we had him in a car seat‚Äù.

Real and (less real) Struggles
- Smoking. It‚Äôs everywhere. I got more second hand smoke on this trip than I have in my entire life. Waiting in the DiDi waiting area at Beijing airport was a special hell. I get headaches from cigarettes and was a headachy mess from time to time worrying about the impact on our kiddo.
- People getting handsy with baby. Our baby is white passing and people were obsessed with him. Waving hi or taking pictures is one thing but random people would try and pick up our kid out of our arms, grab him or kiss him. I‚Äôm all for cultural differences, but not for me looking away for one second and some stranger trying to grab our kid out of their stroller.
- Hot indoor spaces. We‚Äôre from a cold region and are used to indoor spaces being a bit cool. That is NOT the case in China. Cars, malls, any indoor space- hot! Lots of sweating and occasional overheating from kiddo (plus panic from older folks about us having him in tshirts and shorts)
- Aggressiveness on transit. Gosh people seem to be in a rush. Getting shoved, pushed, cut in line, etc just became a daily experience and it was pretty intense
- Things seem to open pretty late. Multiple times we found all the coffee shops around us didn‚Äôt open til 10. I used to be a late riser before I had a kid but that‚Äôs not possible anymore. Hence, hotel breakfasts were nice.

Pleasant surprises:
- The country in general feels very baby friendly, especially compared to some US cities. Most restaurants had baby chairs, some even had bibs and plates or brought us out little snacks for the kid. It was a pleasant surprise just having so many resources for the kid.
- The malls are absolutely insane. I just couldn‚Äôt believe some of the luxury in shopping spaces we passed through. Most amenities I could hope for from the US were available there if you looked (and way more we don‚Äôt have)
- Alipay being ubiquitous everywhere is amazing. Alipay‚Äôs also integrating all transit passes is wonderful
- We don‚Äôt speak any Chinese and got on absolutely fine with the help of google translate and some pointing and nodding on my part.

Like asking if I have any mutual interests or asking if I want to go get a coffee or something  somewhere.

One of the times I accepted I felt like the interaction was going in the direction of dating so I set a boundary.

I am really protective of my own self development and mental health treatment and with High Spectrum Aspergers, Childhood Trauma and Bipolar Depression and have devoted a lot of my life to being compliant with treatment and am in the infancy stages of living a independent financially stable life.

Working a decent first PT job albeit not as greatly performing as I could.

Not spending all or half of the weekly savings I have, though I could do better.

Hanging out with friends + life skills/networking.

I need to perform better with full medication intake consistency and that is one major factor why I refuse to date for a long period of time, because simply I am not ready and that would be irresponsible on my end.

I just don‚Äôt think I will be ready at least for a few years to handle and properly reciprocate such a relationship, I just feel like a jerk and embarrassed for saying ‚ÄúSorry I am not mature or ready enough for a significant relationship beyond friendship‚Äù

I know a lot of people my age in the US with similar realities or not struggle with housing and a lot of factors of living.

I won‚Äôt beat myself up over it, but at a certain point I will be past the beginning of my 20s.

Does anyone think I made a mistake and if so how can I improve with setting boundaries while still being open to dating in the far future.

Or if I am totally wrong and being too punitive and self deprecating + wasting my early adulthood away.

I have no idea how to get to the point. This is a throwaway for the usual reasons. 

My wife Claire (not her real name) and I met in on a random night out, in a busy London bar when I was 24 and she 28. The attraction was immediate and we became a couple very quickly. We didnt use the word exclusive, but in the late 90's, I didnt know of anyone that had to label relationships like that. We had moved in together in to a new rental flat ten months later.  The sexual chemistry was amazing and we were loving life. 

Claire had a lively personality (im being careful of which words I use to avoid recognition by family or friends), fairly loud and the life of the party. I am no shrinking violet and am quite poplar and chatty.

Fast forward to now. We have teenage daughters and have been married for over twenty years, pets and a almost finished the mortgage.

Recently I bumped into a former co-worker and best friend of Claires named Jayne. Jayne used to sit across form Claire at work and they were friends outside of work as well. Now Claire does seem to have friends for a few years and then fall out or just drift away from them. Even when they seemed to be BFF at one time. Jayne (48f) was her bestie back then. Jayne and I had always gotten on, and openly jokingly flirted. She would make suggestive comments and do other things to try to embarrass me, particularly in front of Claire who thought it was hilarious.  I was handsome, tall enough (6'1"") and athletic and girls tended to like a lot about me.

Jayne and I hadn't seen each other for maybe fifteen years. We were in the town center and immediately started joking and having a laugh, falling into our familiar banter. We went for a coffee as we were literally standing outside a branch of a well known coffee chain.

We had a catch up and she then suddenly says she is glad we met again, as something has always bothered her. She wanted to know why I never made a move on her given she lay it all out so many times, she knew I fancied her a bit. I explained I found her attractive but I was with Claire and wouldn't cheat. Jayne frowned and said that I deserved, and could do so much better, and 'they' (the other girlfriends in their group at the time) all thought id eventually dump Claire, given she was a cheater. 

I was startled. I asked her to tell me why she said that. Jayne seemed shocked I reacted confused. She told me she assumed I must have known but forgiven or something as Claire was not great at covering things up. She then apologised she never told me, but it never occurred to her I didnt know something, but surely I was suspicious as Claire had a four year affair with her boss for one.  

To be fair, as the words came out of Jaynes mouth, loads of things clicked into place. I felt such an idiot. Things that if I tried to write down here now would be obvious to you reading, but just seemed explained by Claires narrative back then. I Just believed the best at every turn.  I now know what sometimes didnt feel right, was my intuition screaming at me from the next room where Claire had manipulated me over the years, into locking it away. A lot of this was the vail of sex. She was insatiable, fun and sexy, and initiated constantly. I was thinking with my cock along with all the other manipulation.

I asked Jayne for some more details to match my recollection. It apparently started shortly after Claire started working at that company. He was a charismatic but arrogant arsehole (I know as I met him several times, I didnt like him)  and despite having a family, was known to have been with several other co-workers under him. This was about two years before Claire and I got married and what hurt more was apparently it continued almost as soon as we got back from our honeymoon, and went on for another two years until the boss moved away to Canada with his family. 

Jayne didnt want to say too much more, as it had clearly had an effect on me. Apparently it wasn't every day or even every week Claire cheated, but it was fairly frequent. Jayne also intimated on girls nights out Claire would have a few drinks and sometimes go further than a girlfriend/wife should with some random guy (Kissing and groping).

Now thinking back, there were a few red flags long before this affair. A couple of things that stayed in my mind, but I had no reason to treat as more than me being suspicious unnecessarily. 

Overall, my question isnt was I stupid or just the subject of deceit and gaslighting, but does it matter now.

I have no reason to suspect anything happened after that affair ended. We had kids pretty quickly after that time. They are absolutely mine, no doubt about it. Claire changed over the years. Ironically we now have ended up in basically a dead bedroom (post menopause she is basically asexual she thinks) and things might end for that and various other reasons. 

Im debating if this twenty year old betrayal should be a factor in my current thinking about my marriage, or just base my decisions on things as they are now? 



  
tl;dr  I (52m) met an old friend, and found out my wife (56f) did cheat on me a lot around twenty years ago and quite possibly before that. My marriage might end soon, I dont know if something from so long ago, however difficult, should be a factor in my decision. ",3,1761534185.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

I'm Mexican-American and learning Japanese if that helps. I love record and CD shopping (electronic music, post rock, post punk, etc.) and plan on doing a lot of it during my stay. Coffee, retro gaming, record collecting, digital audio players, journaling/writing, beer, cocktails, ramen, sushi, are some of my interests. 

I have tickets to [mutek ](https://tokyo.mutek.org/en/shows/2025/nocturne-2)at Spotify O-EAST the night of November 22nd. Looks like a cool event. I love Nosaj Thing and Jacques Greene and I'm stoked to listen to everyone else for the first time.   
  
Here's the lineup: 

* **Daito Manabe (JP)** 
* **Halina Rice (UK)** 
* **Martyn Bootyspoon (CA/QC) (VJ: JACKSON Kaki JP)** 
* **MONOCOLOR (AUT) ‚Äì** ***Sentient Ocean*** 
* **NONOTAK (FR/JP)** 
* **SAMO (JP) (VJ: MISOLA JP)** 
* **Verses GT: Jacques Greene + Nosaj Thing (CA/QC + US)**

Tickets are about $29USD currently for 11PM entry and goes til 5AM.   
  
Very excited! But I'm not sure if my whole crew is coming, so I'm wondering if a) anyone else is going and willing to meet up and make friends? and b) if you're not going but also love electronic music, I'm open to finding any spots spinning/playing house, idm, noise, techno, all the good stuff on the rest of the days that I'm in town. 

If this aligns with you, let's talk! And if at the very least I learn about a couple of venues or Tokyo electronic artists, then this post will have been worth it :)

**1. know your boundaries before you start**  
don‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre in a session to figure out what‚Äôs okay and what‚Äôs not. write your rules down and say them clearly. for me it‚Äôs: no kissing, no touching under clothes, and sessions stop immediately if i feel uncomfortable. saying no doesn‚Äôt make you rude it makes you professional.

**2. screen people properly**  
the app i use (youlink) verifies IDs. i always meet new clients in a public spot first, like a park or coffee shop. you can tell a lot about someone in the first 5 minutes.

**3. emotional control is everything**  
this isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúlay there and cuddle.‚Äù you‚Äôre managing someone‚Äôs emotions while keeping your own steady. some ppl open up about their lives, some cry, some just want silence. you have to stay calm and centered no matter what. it‚Äôs weirdly draining sometimes.

**4. hygiene + environment matter a lot**  
you‚Äôre in close contact, so show up clean and put together. bring a fresh blanket, sanitizer, mint/gum, maybe a light body spray (nothing strong). clients notice small stuff. clean energy = repeat bookings.

**5. treat it like a real job**  
be on time. keep notes on regulars. track your hours and income. follow up professionally. the people who make real money at this are the ones who treat it like work, not a quick hustle. if you‚Äôre good at it, you can easily pull $600‚Äì$800 a week without killing yourself with hours.

honestly, it‚Äôs not for everyone. it takes patience, people skills, and thick skin. but if you‚Äôre grounded and know how to create a calm vibe, it‚Äôs a legit way to earn.

1oh3mpy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh3mpy,[Build In Public] Turning an N8N Workflow to a fully functional Ai Application for,"Hello again! Wanted to share some Ai learnings.

For the past few weeks, I‚Äôve been using my own app called ResiboKo, a dead-simple, AI-powered way to track everyday spends without spreadsheets. AND REALLY PROUD HOW USEFUL IT HAS BECOME!

This was inspired by an n8n workflow from one of my friends who shared it to me coz i had problems tracking my expenses. The workflow works but I felt there is so much frictions like configuring TG, postgress memory, database storage etc. WHAT IF I can tranform the workflow into a fully functional application?

sooo. through a mix of n8n workflows + vibe coding sessions + Google Studio + Firebase.

And it works. Like‚Ä¶ it actually works.

The Problem that I have and maybe you also have is..

probably you always wanted to ‚Äútrack expenses.‚Äù Then life happens...ride fare, lunch outs, Grab home, coffee break.The receipts disappear, or never existed. LOL maybe buried under your bag too. And you and I forget everything by the time we get home.

The Pivot...

So I built ResiboKo to track how we actually spend.

* Snap, type, upload or talk and then forget it.
* The AI logs, categorizes, and builds a money story for your week.
* No spreadsheets, no wallet hoarding, no guilt.

This week I added the ‚ÄúCash Leak Finder.‚Äù That feature now shows you where you're leaking $$$ every week. And then Ai suggests saving opportunities where potentially the money could be put to better use and work for you. It‚Äôs lowkey one of my favorites.

If you're building workflows with n8n, try making a mini app with it. I tell you it totally works. Takes time but it works. So far, I have 3 beta users including myself. hahahahha!

NEXT CHALLENGE - How To Find Users. HAHAHA!

Let‚Äôs see where this goes. I am thinking of making a step by step tutorial... hmm",2,1761533889.0,AiForPinoys,0,1.0,False
1oh3m14,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1oh3m14/my_christian_parents_are_adamant_that_my/,My Christian Parents are Adamant That My Relationship Won‚Äôt Last,"A little bit of context: I‚Äôm in my early twenties, I was raised in a Christian home, I used to believe in god wholeheartedly, used to be in the music ministry‚Äî I was in deep. It‚Äôs been roughly two years since I denounced my faith and stopped going to church all together. I still live with my parents (Christians) and they‚Äôve known that I don‚Äôt believe in god ever since then. 

During that time frame after I denounced my faith, I met my boyfriend who is also an atheist. Our relationship is wonderful and we are both dating to marry, so we‚Äôve always thought of our relationship as long term. My parents do like him a lot, despite the language barrier between them. They constantly mention how hard-working and respectful he is. They say he is a good man, and he really is. 

The issue for them is that he is not Christian. Last night we were having coffee and just talking around the dinner table, when the topic of church was brought up. My mom asked my boyfriend if he believed in god, which he said ‚Äúno‚Äù to. He told them he hadn‚Äôt gone to church in years, and that he simply doesn‚Äôt believe. My parents did not look pleased at all, and said ‚Äúthats‚Äôs just not right‚Äù in Spanish. And then my dad went on to me about how my relationship with him will not work out long term because he‚Äôs not Christian, and that one day I will return to god and be born again, and mentioned that he had been right about it before. 

I‚Äôve had one boyfriend before my current one. He had also been atheist, but I was Christian at the time. Our different beliefs may have been part of the reason we broke up, but I know for sure it was not the *whole* reason. During that relationship my father would constantly tell me he wasn‚Äôt the one for me and that we would break up because god has a different man for me. When we did break up, he would give me small speeches about how he knew all along and how he was always right, that I was going to marry a godly man. 

It breaks my heart to hear my parents talk about my current relationship this way. Yes they get along with my boyfriend, they like him, again, they think he‚Äôs a great man‚Ä¶ but in the end,  they aren‚Äôt taking our relationship seriously simply because they genuinely believe god is going to ‚Äúsave me‚Äù and that he has another plan for my life. It breaks my heart to hear from the people I love most that my relationship basically doesn‚Äôt mean anything because it‚Äôs ‚Äúgoing to pass‚Äù, that these deep feelings and this special connection I have with my boyfriend is only temporary in the grand scheme of things because *god* is ‚Äúin control‚Äù. I love my boyfriend with every cell of my body, he‚Äôs my best friend, he‚Äôs my soulmate. I would never change him for anything in the world. I feel that we understand each other completely, and from the way we have gotten to know each other, I am confident that we are compatible in many aspects of life. I want nothing more but to spend the rest of my life with him, and we are both actively working towards getting married in the next 1-3 years. 

I want to have a healthy relationship with my parents, and I want us to continue to be in harmony even after I am married. But I really don‚Äôt see how this is going to be possible when this is the mindset they have. Will they constantly be against my relationship? Against my marriage? Will they always give me speeches about how I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing by being with my man simply because he doesn‚Äôt believe in god? Because they belive I will change? Will they always see him as below themselves? 

I‚Äôm sorry this was long. I tried looking at maybe similar stories to read up on some advice but I couldn‚Äôt really find any. I guess I just want some advice on how to deal with my parents and their comments. How can I make them take my relationship seriously? How can I still maintain a good relationship with them? Does it ever get better?

I would also love to hear stories of those of you who might‚Äôve been in the same position as me, but who made it and are living happily with their partners. I guess I just feel that I need some support in a way. Thank you to all who can offer any advice or words of encouragement. I really appreciate it all.

Recently I went out with my partner, we had a nice meal with apps, mains. I decided to get a tea and some dessert after as there were about 5 people waiting. My partner thinks that once you have finished your meal, you should pay, and you should pretty much leave right away. Otherwise, you're taking up a table the staff could serve. I get the perspective that ordering just a few items and holding up a table for an extra 20 minutes is not as profitable for the restaurant nor the servers.

However, I'm not camping with a coffee and my laptop my whole time there. We order a proper meal and tip generously. I won't linger if it's near closing or the staff is giving the ""are you done yet"" look. If there are just a few people waiting, I will make sure to at least get a coffee or dessert after my meal. If there is a hoarde of customers, I will leave.

Some of my favorite spots in Toronto (like Korean Village) genuinely encourage you to take your time. It is that welcoming vibe that keeps me going back.

1oh3lnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/school/comments/1oh3lnw/math_teachers_learning_style_doesnt_match_what_i/,Math teachers learning style doesn't match what I need,"School motivation and grades

I got into 9th grade this year (first year of highschool in canada anyway) and I need help with advice on motivation and such. This may come off as a vent, but it is not and I just need advice.

My math teacher (not intentional, this just keeps happening) keeps going up a year with me, and for 3 years including this one, shes been my math teacher. Her teaching style is read off a slideshow for 50 minutes that she didn't even make thats impossible to pay attention to the whole time, give you a 4 page worksheet to finish in 15 minutes, (I have adhd and suck at math, so this can be a struggle) and review it. As said prior, I have adhd (and an iron deficiency, which isn't as big of a deal but impacts my motivation even more) and I need advice for studying, attention span, and getting better grades. The BEST final grade I've gotten from her class is 80% last year, and its too late (You can only transfer in the first two weeks which is INSANE cause I was sick lots of the second week but whatever.) Motivation also falls flat cause the class is full of people I hate. The only thing keeping me together in math is anger, spite, and coffee. Anyways, ignore my tangent, I really need advice on this. Should I try to get my parents to email the school and hope they give in?

(P.S, to the mods that banned my comment before, I can cut out the parts that break the guidelines I just genuinely don't know what parts break them. I assume its the sass I'm kinda giving off which I understand but I'm not entirely sure if that's what it is.)",2,1761533798.0,school,0,1.0,False
1oh3l7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1oh3l7p/i_chose_myself_for_my_daughter/,I chose myself for my daughter.,"I‚Äôve been married for a year, and we have a two-year-old daughter. Last night, I decided to end my relationship with my husband because I feel he doesn‚Äôt understand where he went wrong or how his actions have affected me and our family.

When I gave birth, I was in a public hospital during the height of COVID. No one was allowed to accompany me, even after delivery. I had a C-section and stayed in the hospital for five days ‚Äî three days on bed rest and two days to recover. During that time, we were already having issues because he often got impatient whenever I asked for help or needed something.

After giving birth, he was there for a while, but a few months later, he started spending more and more time outside. He would always be out with his friends or working part-time at night, but I never saw any extra money coming in. Since our finances were tight, I was forced to go back to work even though I had stopped working during my pregnancy.

We agreed on an amount that he would contribute monthly, but he often told me at the last minute that he couldn‚Äôt give the full amount. That caused a lot of arguments because I already had our budget planned. I couldn‚Äôt understand why he didn‚Äôt have enough money despite all his supposed part-time jobs.

He also spends too much time with his friends. Whenever I bring it up, he says, ‚ÄúSo what if I‚Äôm with my friends while you‚Äôre sleeping?‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt see anything wrong with it. I also found out that less than 12 hours after I gave birth, he went out to attend a birthday party. When I confronted him, he said there was nothing wrong with it because it was ‚Äújust lunch,‚Äù and that I was overreacting.

Aside from that, he often gaslights me and invalidates what I say. For example, if a mutual friend tells me something and I bring it up, he immediately insists it‚Äôs wrong ‚Äî even if he wasn‚Äôt there. He constantly makes me feel like my thoughts and opinions don‚Äôt matter, and it‚Äôs always as if I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs mistaken or unreasonable.

He also tends to ignore our daughter. Most of the time, when she tries to talk to him, he‚Äôs focused on his phone and doesn‚Äôt respond right away. I usually have to tell him, ‚ÄúYour daughter is talking to you,‚Äù before he looks up. He treats me the same way ‚Äî he rarely listens when I speak, and I always feel dismissed.

At night, he also shows a lack of respect. He works on the night shift, but whenever he has free time, he spends it playing computer games. He‚Äôs often very loud, even when I‚Äôm resting or when our daughter is asleep. We‚Äôve talked about it several times, and he promises to change, but he always goes back to the same behavior.

I know that I also have some shortcomings. For example, he sometimes asks me to make him coffee when he wakes up, but it‚Äôs hard for me to do that because when he‚Äôs awake, I‚Äôm already at work ‚Äî or sometimes, he‚Äôs already out with his friends. He also complains that there‚Äôs no food, but most of the time, he wastes food because he chooses to eat outside with his friends instead of at home.

There was also a time when he was sick, and I admit I wasn‚Äôt able to take care of him that much. But part of me still felt hurt remembering that when I was the one in the hospital recovering from childbirth, he went out to attend a birthday party. He also says that I don‚Äôt support him in playing basketball, but it‚Äôs hard to do that when he chooses to play even when our daughter was in the emergency room ‚Äî simply because he already told his friends that he would join the game.

Overall, I feel emotionally drained and unappreciated. I‚Äôve tried to understand him and communicate many times, but he continues to invalidate my feelings, neglect our child, and disrespect our home.

Now, I‚Äôm choosing myself ‚Äî not out of selfishness, but for my daughter. I would rather have her grow up in an incomplete family than in a dysfunctional one. I don‚Äôt want her to grow up seeing me slowly lose myself, or watching her father be emotionally absent. She deserves to see a mother who is at peace and a home where love and respect are present ‚Äî even if that means it‚Äôs just the two of us for now.",1,1761533760.0,family,1,1.0,False

1oh3gqa,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc0OsOWuBHc,[GUIDE] All the Ways to Turn On Noise Cancellation on Your AirPods Pro (for iPhone and Android),"**IMPORTANT: Active Noise Cancellation is only available on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max.**¬†This feature does not exist on standard AirPods (1st, 2nd, or 3rd generation).

If you own a pair of AirPods Pro, one of their best features is¬†**Active Noise Cancellation**, which uses microphones to detect and block out external sounds, letting you focus on your music, podcast, or phone call. But how do you actually turn it on?

This guide will show you all the ways to¬†**enable AirPods Pro noise cancelling**, whether you're using an iPhone, iPad, or even an Android device. Let's dive in and block out the world.

# Why Use Active Noise Cancellation?

* **Focus:**¬†It's perfect for noisy offices, commutes, or coffee shops, allowing you to concentrate without distractions.
* **Immersive Audio:**¬†By reducing background noise, you can hear the details in your music and podcasts more clearly, even at lower volumes.
* **Travel:**¬†It's a game-changer for flights and train rides, significantly reducing engine drone and cabin noise.

# Watch Our Video Guide!

There are a few different ways to enable this feature. Watch our quick video tutorial to see all the methods in action, including the fastest way through Control Center.

>**Watch our step-by-step video guide on all the ways to turn on Noise Cancellation for your AirPods Pro!**

# How to Turn On AirPods Noise Cancelling

Here are the main ways to control your listening modes.

# Method 1: The Fastest Way (Control Center on iPhone/iPad)

1. Wear your AirPods Pro.
2. Open¬†**Control Center**:
   * On an iPhone with Face ID or an iPad: Swipe down from the top-right corner.
   * On an iPhone with a Home button: Swipe up from the bottom.
3. **Long-press the volume slider**. It looks like a speaker icon with a vertical bar.
4. A new menu will appear. Tap the¬†**""Noise Control""**¬†button on the bottom left.
5. Select¬†**""Noise Cancellation.""**¬†You can also choose ""Transparency"" (to hear your surroundings) or ""Off.""

# Method 2: Directly on Your AirPods Pro

You can cycle through noise control modes without even touching your phone.

1. Press and hold the¬†**force sensor**¬†(the indented part) on the stem of either the left or right AirPod.
2. You will hear a chime as it cycles between¬†**Noise Cancellation**¬†and¬†**Transparency**¬†mode.

# Method 3: From the Settings App (iPhone/iPad)

1. With your AirPods Pro connected, go to¬†**Settings > Bluetooth**.
2. Find your AirPods Pro in the list and tap the¬†**""i"" (info) icon**¬†next to them.
3. Under the ""Noise Control"" section, you can select¬†**""Noise Cancellation,""**¬†""Transparency,"" or ""Off.""

# Method 4: For Android Users

**How to enable noise cancelling on AirPods Pro with Android?**¬†Since there is no Control Center or native settings menu, you must use the physical controls.

1. Connect your AirPods Pro to your Android device via Bluetooth settings.
2. Press and hold the¬†**force sensor**¬†on the stem of either AirPod to cycle between Noise Cancellation and Transparency mode. This is the only way to switch modes on Android without a third-party app.

1oh3fzi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh3fzi,End of October 2 nighter on Farm and Booth Lakes,"Got out for my last canoe trip of the season this past weekend.

I arrived at the Shall Lake parking lot around 4:30 Friday afternoon and got on the water soon after. I knew I‚Äôd be getting to the park late (for the end of October) so I opted to stay on Farm Lake. I got camp set up, and, having picked up a bag of fire wood on the way, night 1 was pretty easy. Intermittent drizzle and 2 degree temperatures didn‚Äôt dampen my spirits. I had a great meal and read by the fire until 10:45 when I turned in.

Morning was slow and peaceful. Colder weather means more elaborate meals, (being able to pack things like mayonnaise and sour cream without worrying about them going off) so scrambled omelette croissants we breakfast. More reading and coffee by the fire. The sun appeared briefly, but decided to hide again when I finally got out on the water.

My initial plan was to head to Godda Lake and do the loop, but when the forecast started  predicting sub zero mornings I decided to shorten the days, and opted for Booth Lake. Also, using Site Scout, I noticed that there was no one else booked for Booth, so I jumped on the opportunity to have the entire lake to myself (and my dog).

The trip there was fairly uneventful, with the exception of paddling through flurries on Booth. It was incredibly beautiful, the sun broke through for a few moments, the snow was falling and I was paddling along at a nice pace. The afternoon cleared, and we spent a few hours exploring Booth. 

A cooler night on Booth Lake, but I‚Äôd brought my long undies and layered up (t-shirt, long sleeve, wool button up, light sweater, wool sweater, jacket, toque and buff). So again, I was comfortable enough, sitting by the fire, reading until 11ish, when I finally called it a night. My -7 sleeping bag was just enough for night two, when it dipped down to about -3. I‚Äôm glad I filled my nalgene with hot water before getting into bed. 

This was the most silent trip I‚Äôve ever done, and I‚Äôve camped through every month of the year. There was little to no wind, so no lapping of water on the shore, no leaves in the trees, no insects, very few birds, and only the occasional squirrel chittering. It was a great chance to clear my head and enjoy the peace and solitude. And, a great chance to get the canoe out for it‚Äôs last trip of the year.",3,1761533312.0,algonquinpark,1,1.0,False

I found him really smart and after our work he used to take me and his acquaintance ( let's call her R ) for coffee... He used to be really caring, would ask me if I reached home after work, would ask me if I had lunch/dinner, would make sure i ate something when work got stressful. I eventually started developing a crush on him. I used to leave tiny chits behind with pick up lines and he found it cute.. it went on and on.. and one day I had gone drinking with my friends and i asked him if he wanted to come too, he said he would come if I was alone. So he used to ask me regularly when we could meet... And during the last day of internship I told him we could meet only under one condition - I'm serious about this and i don't do anything casual -- i wrote this in a letter and gave it to him. So we agreed to meet. 
We met and he asked why I didn't ask him out before so I told him I thought he liked R. He said no, he only sees her as a friend and naturally they'll be close cause she's his acquaintance. I asked him if he liked me back to which he said he did and let's continue this. So for clarity I asked if we are dating to which he said he needs to think about it cause there is something bothering him. 
A week later we met again and he called me his girlfriend. The next 20 days were pure bliss, we met regularly, and he made a lot of promises ( "" I'll never leave you, I'm not going anywhere"" ""I'll never make you sad"" lol ) . And kept reassuring me that I don't need to worry about R ( should have thought about it then but nvm ) even without me asking about her. Then during the last date he said he felt I was more into this relationship than he is and told me that he feels like he didn't chase me to get me... Then he told me not to overthink about it. So I texted him too that I can't afford being sad again ( I didn't have a good childhood growing up ) if there's anything please tell but he said there's nothing to worry about.. we would talk 5 times a day and I'm not a calling person, and one day he even texted saying"" this is love"".. then one fine day, he ended things. We were supposed to exchange gifts then, and he got me a book and there was a letter attached to it which said how much he cant see this relationship go forward cause plot twist -- it's a one sided one because I'm the only one in love and he isn't in love with me cause he likes someone else -- I asked him if it was R.. he said yes. 
I fought with him a lot ( I'm known to have a soft spot on people ) and yet I fought with him. He dropped me home that day , said it's not right to leave me alone and go, but then when he came home, he told my mom - "" I don't like your daughter"".. He then proceeded to ask R out cause he said if R doesn't accept then we could get back together ( lol ) and I was in shock I didn't realise what was happening on that day i couldn't tell him "" as if i would get back with you "". The next day he asked R out and she said that her parents won't allow.. and he called me back asking "" how hard did you pray, she said no "". 
I then went there and ended things with him, tore and threw the letter he wrote and even then he was trying to say "" I like you but I liked her more , try understanding my pov "" ( lol again ) 
I then told him I need space. But he called me that night and said it's not fair cause he doesn't have anyone else to talk to other than me and R ... he then went through some personal shit and he was saying that he felt like he deserved whatever happened to him because of the way he treated me and wanted me to forgive him. And when I asked again if he liked me he said yes, and the reason why he wrote that he doesn't like me in the letter is so that i won't be like ""hey, let's work it out"". I don't know what to believe and i feel like I lack emotional clarity. I told him too that my friend said it looks like you tried hitting on other girls but the only reason you chose me is cause I'm naive and i flirted back... He got really defensive about it and in the end I had to apologise for it.
i have now gone no contact. Initial few days were hard...I'm not sad i lost him... I'm in a way happy that I got to know in the beginning cause we dated barely for 20 days. But I'm just sad about the whole reason for breakup... I feel like I was used, i feel like I was a distraction... And now I feel really sad.... And I feel like he never really saw my mind (obviously) 
And how do I overcome that ?

PS - after the break up he told that apparently he had asked R only if he should date me cause he told her "" I like someone else but L (me ) kind of asked me out what do I do ? "" To which R said "" you may not get the other person but you' might get L... So try it out "" and when we broke up she said "" you have so many fan girls, you can date anyone and proceed "" and hearing all that I told him that those comments are insensitive and I'm disappointed in her and told him never to date anyone else unless he gets over her completely if not her cause some of us put our entire heart into it . i then got her in my friends suggestion on insta and realised that she removed me and my best friend from her followers list. it kind of makes me feel sad that she removed me... But i feel like I did the right thing cause somethings had to be said ? And when I told him this he said that she can never do something like this... He always and always protects her and I'm done with this...",3,1761532811.0,TwoXIndia,3,0.8,False

I came here for my master‚Äôs; the first few years were all studies, friends, weekend drives. I wasn‚Äôt chasing relationships just building my life.

Lately, I‚Äôve felt pulled toward something deeper: the kind of connection where you can talk about anything‚Ä¶ or say nothing and still feel understood. I‚Äôm 5'5"", brown-skinned, calm, loyal, and low-drama. I‚Äôm not the loudest in the room; I‚Äôm the one who remembers how you take your coffee and checks if you got home safe.

What I value: kindness, steadiness, and emotional maturity. Someone grounded, with her own dreams, who still believes in building something together two people who show up for each other, celebrate wins, and make the hard days lighter.

If you‚Äôve had heartbreak, I get it. Most of us have. I still believe in people who love deeply, stay loyal, and choose each other on ordinary Tuesdays. I‚Äôm not after fairy-tale sparks just a real conversation to see if our energies fit.

A few quiet joys: unhurried walks, simple cooking, late-night drives, a good playlist, laughing at small things, and sharing comfortable silence. If you‚Äôre introverted (or introvert-friendly), we‚Äôll probably get along.

If any of this resonates, message me with two things: your comfort movie and one small thing that made you smile this week. No pressure, no expectations just seeing where it goes.

I don't think we'll ever get some of the very expensive items I've seen the US Vine program has released, but I'm happy with where I'm at in the program.

I‚Äôve been in the Vine program for 15 months.  In that time, I‚Äôve ordered (as of today) 267 items.  Some of these have been good, some less so.  I‚Äôve been fortunate in that I‚Äôve generally ordered ‚Äòstuff‚Äô that I (or a family member) had a use for. There‚Äôs been lots of power banks and cables, a few desktop USB charging stations and 240V power boards in general.

‚Ä¢	Boxer briefs ‚Äì Step One & Bamboo Cool

‚Ä¢	Bamynoir coffee equipment

Aside the occasional small group hangouts that were fun, this was my first ever house party that had more than 10 people (around 30 in this case). I had to hide on occasion with my headphones on to cool down. Upstairs was more peaceful than anything. Might've been sleep deprivation or the fact that the double caffeine I drank had long left my body, but I wanted to sleep. Later on the party got to the stage where people started throwing up. Interesting sight and smell. Glad my mum didn't let me drink (and my boyfriend was there to also make sure of that on her behalf hahah). It's also a good thing that I already knew a few people there so I wasn't a total stranger, and my man checked up on me when I was hiding, bless him. Also witnessed couples making out in rooms. There was in fact a lot of people and my brain stopped working. -100hp

On the plus I met a few people from college I never interacted with who were nice to me and we exchanged compliments. Everyone was nice to each other and we all got photos. My face looked chopped but the point is I think the majority of us had fun. Food was also pretty tip tier.

I came here for my master‚Äôs, the first few years were all studies, friends, weekend drives. I wasn‚Äôt chasing relationships just building my life.

Lately, I‚Äôve felt pulled toward something deeper: the kind of connection where you can talk about anything‚Ä¶ or say nothing and still feel understood. I‚Äôm 5'5"", brown-skinned, calm, loyal, and low-drama. I‚Äôm not the loudest in the room; I‚Äôm the one who remembers how you take your coffee and checks if you got home safe.

What I value: kindness, steadiness, and emotional maturity. Someone grounded, with her own dreams, who still believes in building something together two people who show up for each other, celebrate wins, and make the hard days lighter.

If you‚Äôve had heartbreak, I get it. Most of us have. I still believe in people who love deeply, stay loyal, and choose each other on ordinary Tuesdays. I‚Äôm not after fairy-tale sparks just a real conversation to see if our energies fit.

A few quiet joys: unhurried walks, simple cooking, late-night drives, a good playlist, laughing at small things, and sharing comfortable silence. If you‚Äôre introverted (or introvert-friendly), we‚Äôll probably get along.

If any of this resonates, message me with two things: your comfort movie and one small thing that made you smile this week. No pressure, no expectations just seeing where it goes.

1oh34zz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh34zz,I think we need to admit there is a difference in POV here,"The writing for OTL is not as complex as some people think. I want to talk about Eunhyuk's behavior towards Sooae here after timeskip. 

We first see him in 106 after timeskip in the panel that traumatised so many people. Because how can the sweet eunhyuk who was soo in love with sooae look at her with such cold eyes? 

When I went to check people's opinion when they first saw it, a lot of them said something like 'he's acting as if she's the one who left him or did him dirty.' 

But what if that's true? 

Eunhyuk's resting face is still somewhat same if you notice his old panels yes but still lack of reaction seemed to give an impression that things ended badly from his Pov too. 

Then we have their office reunion, which pissed off so many more people (understandably so). His initial reaction to her is nervous/surprised at end of 107, so he wasn't expecting her to be on project. Then we had their breakroom scene where he acted polite and a little friendly.

Both sooae and we were mad coz why are u talking to her as if she was just one of your old classmates? But isn't this the way you will act with your ex where things ended messily, and now you were forced to work on project together? 

And if sooae had returned his energy here, we could have even seen eunhyuk talk lightly with her and crack some jokes in future (as he later does in 108). But sooae shut him off completely and from his reaction, you could see that he wasn't expecting that and stepped back. Because one thing eunhyuk does is respect her boundaries. 

And in Korea, it's uncommon to address each other informally like he did to her & he probably thought he made her uncomfortable bcz it's been 10 years. He was just her high schools boyfriend for a short while. 

Later on, he keeps that professional demeanour, and then comes the car scene. Bringing coffee for someone u are gonna work with for long period in a day is common courtesy, nothing wrong, and then it spills and you see him act before thinking by cleaning her up. 

He acts exactly like an ex who loved you a lot and still harbors some old feelings but keeps space coz from his pov you ended things. But his body betrays his mind, just like sooae's does too when she takes care of him while sick or when she protects him from rumors. 

Anyways it's here when sooae acts a little informal by groaning at spilled coffee that he cannot help but joke about being professional. 

It was a teasing remark which again triggered many people but it may feel normal if again from his pov, she left him. 

Their conversation in 109 about eternity is also cordial. Everything is fine but then the shift happens when sooae snaps at him. And it's from here on that his attitude changes & his behavior starts to depict guilt. 

Even in 115, he is shocked to hear that she waited for him outside in snow & punishes himself. He acts cautious around her in 117 but also says things like u haven't changed & enquires about her bond with dohwa. It seems a little resentful as if he hates that everyone and everything in her life remained same except for him. 

Even in 118, he does his best to avoid any interaction wiith her & even while holding her in storage room, he addresses her formally & tries to remain detached so as to not offend her. He only wishes her after she gives him an opening by touching his chest. 

I think rn the biggest mystery isn't him leaving but rather why does he refuse to answer. Now, he knows, sooae hates him for how things ended or that his actions hurt her but why does he refuse to give an explanation?? logically, it may seem that it's hard to open up that conversation without addressing all associated trauma with it but I guess we will find out soon. 

Because his behavior seems pretty linear if he thinks that sooae didn't want that relationship. But if so, then who interrupted their communication is a question! Because it doesn't seem like it was raim now. 

I mean what if he actually left her a new number to contact him but she never got it? Idk too many theories but yeah wanted to post this coz some people think he was deliberately being malicious towards sooae when it is not the case! ",6,1761532399.0,operationtruelove,2,0.88,False

I‚Äôm a recent college grad currently working 4 days a week at a cafe, and 3 at a large promotions company (which is what I studied in undergrad and had several internships in the field). 

The promotions company job is only part time but hours are flexible and I certainly could be working more (up to a limit) if my schedule cleared up more. It gets me enough money to pay rent, bills, and groceries as well as save a bit and have a little spending cash but I wouldn‚Äôt be making that much money. (It‚Äôs worth mentioning I don‚Äôt have student loans thankfully).

The cafe is extremely high volume and exhausting. I currently dont have a weekend and am working from 7 in the morning to 3 or often later in the afternoon, and my commute is quite lengthy so by the time I get home I‚Äôm a gross and sweaty mess and so tired I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything besides shower and cook dinner and by then I have to go to sleep to get up the next morning. The only real perks are that I get lots of free food and coffee and I like my coworkers a lot. Allegedly theyre going to start scheduling me 3 days a week instead of 4 but management is flakey about schedule changes and even then that leaves me with only one day off.

Needless to say I feel like I‚Äôm burning the candle at both ends here. Not only do I not have time for myself to be a person, but I don‚Äôt have the time or energy to network with people either outside of or in the promo company to get a better idea of where I want to take my career. Even if I got an interview for a full time job I wouldn‚Äôt even have space in my schedule for it unless I called out sick. I also really want to try my hand at freelance photography work as I spent a lot of my undergrad doing that for concerts, dance and fashion shows, etc, but in my current state I truly cant bring myself to even try. 

I‚Äôm scared to make the leap as I really enjoy having more financial security but I‚Äôm only a few months out of college and already completely burnt out.

built a nextcloud box out of a recycled dell optiplex. 2tb drive, debian, fail2ban, vpn back to my phone. cost me a weekend and maybe forty bucks. it hums in the corner now like a little altar to not trusting corporations with my brain.

first week felt good. like i‚Äôd unplugged something that had been siphoning me dry without my noticing. synced my phone, moved my files, set up encrypted backups to an external drive in a fireproof box under my desk.

then the withdrawal hit.

not technical. psychological. i‚Äôd be at a coffee shop and reach for a file and remember it was at home. my server was at home. i wasn‚Äôt. for fifteen years i could access anything, anywhere, instantly. now i had to plan. think about what i‚Äôd need before leaving. felt like carrying a physical notebook again, but worse, because i knew the infrastructure still existed and i‚Äôd locked myself out on purpose.

second break was sharing. sent a friend a doc link out of habit. except now it‚Äôs a nextcloud url that needs an account or a download. he asked me to just email it. i did. felt like losing.

third was photos. used to auto-upload to google photos where the ai would tag faces, let me search ‚Äúsunset‚Äù or ‚Äúdog‚Äù and pull up six years of shots. now they pile up in folders and i have to remember filenames. looking into photoprism but it‚Äôs not the same. i‚Äôm the curator now. more work.

biggest break was realizing how much i‚Äôd outsourced my own memory. google remembered for me. now i‚Äôm relearning how to keep a mental index. it‚Äôs slower. frustrating. but it‚Äôs mine.

not going back though. added redundancy since then. second backup at a friend‚Äôs place, rsync jobs nightly, encrypted offsite copies. system‚Äôs stronger now. but the withdrawal‚Äôs real. your brain gets wired to the cloud the same way it does to nicotine or doomscrolling. you don‚Äôt notice till you stop.

if you‚Äôre thinking about it: start small. one service at a time. documents, then photos, then email if you‚Äôre brave. don‚Äôt rip it all out at once or you‚Äôll break your workflows and crawl back in a week. build the setup first. migrate slow. accept that some things will be less convenient. that‚Äôs the cost.

for me it was worth it. my data lives in a box i can touch now. if it dies it‚Äôs because i fucked up, not because some tos changed or an algorithm flagged my account.

I never really felt included or understood by many people before, I have social anxiety and it took a long time of medication and forcing me to get up from bed to stay alive, i was always feeling awkward and sad that i wasn't someone best friend or the first person to come to mind, and being a teenager, having the most fun with only grown people of my family instead of people my age was frustrating. So imagine being first day and already having 8 people who want to be friends with you and show interest. 
In this friend group I met Diego (fake name, 23 M), he is a quirky guy with a dark and sexual sense of humor but he was nice talking to. He came from a problematic relationship with his boyfriend, it was the kind of relationship that's a cycle of breaking up and getting back together, so me and my friends used to talk to him and comfort him. I used to tell him that if he isn't happy in a relationship, he should just leave, he didn't deserve going through that pain, but I was very careful about not triggering him because of his bipolar disorder. Diego had this moments where he would start crying out of nowhere or saying weird things about ""proving to his boyfriend why he should stay with him"" and even saying unhinged things like ""if i was a girl I would've just get myself pregnant just to have him tied to me""

That didn't really bother me because I understanded that mentally he wasn't at his best, but to my group of friends it seem to annoy them.
Every time Diego would leave, they would start saying how naive he was for not leaving and how it started to annoy them. Even saying they didn't want to hang out with him or talk because everything would spiral towards his ex.
I tried to be civilized and empathetic in this conversations about Diego and how it's difficult for a person with mental disorders to deal with things like this but I was not always listened so I ended up just agreeing to keep the conversation peaceful and to not upset anyone.
This group constantly talked shit about others, even friends and I stupidly stayed quiet.
A side note but I was always treated in that group like the baby, the youngest one, the naive one, so they had this kind of soft spot for me and treat me differently, that bothered me since im not a kid, im a man.
So in a call with friends about a college project that was really important, 3 of my friends asked me about what was going on with me since I was kinda distracted by anxiety, and I talked about this ""kid"" treatment i was having by a specific individual and how it felt nobody was taking me seriously.
Basically, they told the person about this conversation and she told me she couldn't trust me anymore and that she didn't want to be friends anymore, that she felt betrayed, that spiraled into me being more anxious, acting out and ended up fucking it up with the project which ended up with me being cut off by my group of friends, removed from my project group, leaving me alone. 
I won't lie and make me the victim, I did some mistakes and wasn't mature enough, but to be fair, working 5 a.m, 3 days straight with almost no sleeping time the night before the deadline with a bunch of people strictly telling others what to do mixed with my medications that made me very sleepy. Not good combo. And adding my need to prove that I needed to be perfect to keep them happy.

During that time I started relying on people I was in good terms with to cope with the frustration and anger of that moment, I have to admit I was angry at the fact that I was cut off for being problematic and not trustworthy when these people were all but trustworthy, so this is the part where I think I was the asshole. Since my career is not very crowded I was quite popular among my peers, so, them noticing I was in this group and then going solo was big news. So people started asking me what happend, you know, juicy gossip.
I started warning people about my ex friend group and speaking about my experiences, which made others speak about their own experiences with this people.
One day, I was getting coffee with two friends and I spoke about Diego.
I told them everything my group did behind his back and how they were hypocritical about cutting me off for problematic behavior when they talked about him and how i didn't know how to talk to him about it without triggering him.
I still don‚Äôt know who told him, but somehow the story reached him, causing a serious emotional crisis to him, which only proved to my ex group that I was the bad guy and they were right. That was a hit for my reputation among our mutual friends, ending a lot of friendships. 
One guy of this group told me about what happend and blamed me for it. I won't say it was confrontational but the dude was serious about the topic. 
It happens that I was in the same class with his best friend, and when I asked her, she was shocked because she said that his emotional crisis had nothing to do with me, since she would've known.

When I texted Diego, he confirmed that the crisis was because of me, because he ""didn't need to find out that way"" about this thing since he wasn't in his best mentally place and that even tho I didn't do it for evil, I fucked it up and we ended up distancing.

Now the part where I think i wasn't even an asshole, Diego even after all, it's still friends with my ex group and hating me or at least being bothered by me, giving me annoyed looks or walking away speaking loudly to them.
At this point I give up trying to help or being good to everyone, it's been 1 year since this happened and he still treats me worst than an enemy when he's still with the people that called him annoying. 

I feel like I was treated unfairly just by trying to make good at my time and also cut off for some stupid drama.

1oh2wbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh2wbv,Five Years as Your Secret Lover? Fine. Your Rival's Ring Looks PERFECT on Me!.,"Five years as Nathan Pierce's secret, and I was finally ready to leave.


That night changed everything.


Right in the heat of the moment, just as we were about to climax, he casually dropped: ""Jade, I'm getting married.""


My 30th birthday was in five days‚Äîthe day Nathan had promised he'd marry me.


My heart literally stopped. Finally! I thought this was him keeping his promise: ""Nathan, I've been waiting for‚Äî""


""Isabella's back from London. She's pregnant."" he cut me off, his voice still breathless from what we'd just done. ""Tonight's our last time.""


The smile froze on my face instantly.


I stared at my reflection in the mirror‚Äîpale as death, like all the blood in my body had turned to ice.


Even though he'd just brought me to the heights of ecstasy, now my heart felt nothing but cold emptiness.


Afterward, he acted like nothing happened, methodically buttoning his white shirt.


I kept my head down, pulling on my stockings with trembling hands: ""Nathan... are you forgetting something?""


He didn't even look up, voice flat: ""I promised you twenty percent of company shares once we stabilized. Don't worry‚ÄîI'll have legal draft the paperwork tomorrow.""


My hands froze mid-motion. My eyes filled with tears I couldn't control.


So he really had forgotten everything he'd ever said to me.


Had he never actually planned to marry me?


""Shares?"" I laughed bitterly, voice breaking. ""Nathan, these five years I've been with you‚Äîis that all I'm worth? Twenty percent?""


He finally turned to look at me, still buttoning his shirt: ""What else? Jade, you know what the company's worth now. You should be grateful.""


Looking at that face that once made my heart race, now it just felt like staring at a stranger.


""Nathan, what have I meant to you all these years‚Äî""


His phone buzzed before I could finish.


Seeing the name on screen, Nathan's voice instantly went soft as honey: ""What's wrong, baby?""


Isabella's sweet voice drifted through the speaker: ""Nathan, why aren't you home yet? The baby and I are getting hungry. I want you to cook for us.""


""Of course, I'll be right there. Wait for me.""


He hung up, grabbed his jacket, and walked out. Didn't even pause as he passed me.


Watching him rush away, my heart felt like someone was squeezing it in a fist. I couldn't breathe.


Five years ago, Nathan's white moonlight Isabella had dumped his useless ass and jetted off to London to find her happiness.


Nathan fell apart completely‚Äîgetting wasted at dive bars, starting fights, coming home beaten bloody.


I was the one who found him on my way home from work, took him in, and nursed him back to health bit by bit.


Later, we fell for each other and made it official.


When the company was just starting out, Nathan had hustle during negotiations but didn't know jack about anything else.


All the tedious document sorting, process coordination‚ÄîI taught myself everything from scratch to make it work.


The day he blew our first major deal, all he did was hide in the stairwell chain-smoking.


I pulled three all-nighters, showed up at the client's office with a new proposal, and literally stole the contract back from our competitors.


Even the core team members he relies on now‚ÄîI was the one who talked them into staying when they wanted to quit.


These past years, I've worn the ""secretary"" title while secretly analyzing real estate markets, avoiding risks, quietly securing properties he can't even count.


Industry headhunters never stopped trying to poach me, each offer more tempting than the last. But I never even hesitated.


Because Nathan once held my hands and said: ""Jade, I really can't live without you. Once I get established, I swear I'll give you the wedding of your dreams on your 30th birthday.""


People at the office gossiped about us constantly. It's not like I never wanted to go public.


But every time I brought it up, he'd frown and brush me off: ""Jade, the company's still growing. I don't want everyone knowing about us yet. I promise you‚Äîwhen you turn thirty, I'll marry you. I'll make you the most envied Mrs. Pierce in the city!""


One sentence. I believed it for five whole years.


I stood by him from cramped studio apartments to corner offices, from nobody to industry success.


I always believed that at thirty, I'd get that fairy-tale wedding he promised.


But his white moonlight came back, and he dove headfirst into her arms without hesitation‚Äîeven got her pregnant.


He threw away every promise he'd made me like garbage.


Fine. Then I didn't need to waste another second on him either.


Reality check time. I dialed Mr. Stone's number: ""Mr. Stone, this is Jade Rivers. I accept your job offer.""


""Excellent news. When can you start?""


I used to joke with Nathan: ""If you don't marry me by thirty, I'm leaving. I'll go work for your biggest competitor. Don't say I didn't warn you!""


He'd pull me close and swear: ""I'll never let you leave me, Jade. Without you, I'm dead. The company's dead too.""


I hung up and wiped away my last tear.


Nathan Pierce, go marry your precious white moonlight. I won't stop you.


In five days you'll be saying ""I do,"" and I'll be saying ""I quit.""


We're done.


Chapter 2


Next morning, I walked into Pierce Holdings to submit my resignation letter.


The second I stepped off the elevator, chaos hit me like a wall of sound.


Isabella Hayes, stood in the center of the office wearing a pink sundress, surrounded by a crowd of ass-kissers.


""Everyone's been working so hard! These are homemade pastries I brought to show my appreciation. Please, try some!""


Her voice was honey-sweet, that practiced smile never wavering. ""I'd really appreciate your support going forward!""


""Mrs. Pierce, you're too kind!""


""Mr. Pierce is so lucky to have a wife like you!""


""Five years long-distance with Mr. Pierce‚Äîthat's true love! Congratulations on finally being together!""


Seeing this, I wanted to laugh at the irony.


Five years long-distance? Come on, I was the one who'd been by Nathan's side this whole time!


Without me, Isabella probably never would've made it to the Mrs. Pierce throne.


I tried to slip past the lovefest and head straight to Nathan's office, but her cold voice stopped me dead.


""So you're Secretary Rivers?""


Isabella approached me, eyes scanning me like I was something she'd scraped off her shoe. ""Nathan mentions you all the time. Says you're very... helpful around here.""


I forced a smile. ""Thank you, Ms. Hayes.""


""Ms. Hayes? Everyone calls me Mrs. Pierce. You're calling me Ms. Hayes?""


She laughed coldly. ""I heard some interesting things‚Äîapparently you don't see yourself as an employee here, but as the boss's wife. Is that right?""


I could feel the trap closing around me.


""Those are just rumors. I hope Mrs. Pierce won't misunderstand.""


""Good. I'm a little thirsty‚Äîcould you make me some coffee? Hand-brewed, please.""


As soon as she said this, the employees around her lowered their heads and began to whisper.


Everyone knew that despite my secretary title, I never did menial tasks.


Nathan had always protected me from that stuff. I never had to move files, let alone serve coffee.


""Mrs. Pierce, you're pregnant‚Äîcoffee really isn't good for the baby,"" I said calmly. ""I'm Mr. Pierce's secretary. I handle business affairs, not coffee service‚Äî""


""Shut up! Who do you think you are to lecture me?""


SLAP!


Isabella's palm connected with my face so hard my right cheek went numb instantly.


I stood there stunned. Just as I raised my hand to hit back‚Äî


""Jade, what the hell are you doing?""


Nathan's voice.


His fingers wrapped around my wrist like a vise, face dark as a storm cloud.


""Didn't you see? She hit me!""


""Nathan, your secretary was bullying me first! I just wanted her to make me coffee, but she refused and said I had no right to ask her to do these things. All your employees saw it‚ÄîI was just upset!""


Nathan's eyes swept over the staff, who immediately nodded like bobbleheads.


""That's right, Secretary Rivers refused and told Mrs. Pierce to find someone else.""


""Jade, how dare you!""


Nathan shoved me backward hard. I couldn't keep my balance and hit the floor.


My knee scraped raw against the ground, it really hurts!


But Nathan didn't spare me a single glance. Instead, he crouched down to comfort Isabella.


""Baby, don't be upset. You're pregnant‚Äîgetting angry isn't good for you or the baby. My secretary was out of line. I'll discipline her for you.""


Then he looked up at me, eyes cold as ice.


""One slap wasn't enough. Isabella, hit her again.""


""Nathan, what are you saying?""


My brain went blank. What was he saying? He wanted Isabella to slap me AGAIN?


""It's okay, Nathan. I was just angry. You said Secretary Rivers really helps you‚ÄîI wouldn't want to offend her...""


Before Isabella could finish her fake protest, Nathan grabbed her hand. ""Don't be afraid. I'll show you how to do it properly. Focus the force in your palm, strike clean and fast!""


SLAP!


The slap echoed through the office like a gunshot. Before I could even process it, I was on the floor again.


Chapter 3


The burning pain spread through my nerves like fire. I bit down hard on my lip and slowly dragged myself up from the floor.


Before I could even steady myself, Nathan's voice cut through the air: ""Harder. This is how you teach someone a lesson‚Äîmake sure she knows who's really in charge!""


The second slap hit even harder than the first.


Blood immediately trickled from the corner of my mouth, the metallic taste flooding my senses.


The third slap snapped my head to the side, hair flying everywhere. I must have looked completely pathetic.


""Perfect! See how it's done? Isabella, remember‚Äînever let anyone push you around!""


After the beating, Nathan looked at Isabella with pure satisfaction, voice dripping with affection: ""In this company, it's just you and me at the top. If Jade doesn't obey you, this is exactly how you handle it. I've got your back‚Äîdon't be afraid!""


""I know, Nathan. Sorry for causing such a scene on my first day. Everyone's staring now. Let's go to your office‚ÄîI'm exhausted, and so is the baby.""


Isabella pouted prettily as Nathan helped her toward his office.


""Jade, make fresh coffee and bring it in. If you don't listen to Isabella again, this is what happens. I've been too soft on you all these years‚Äîmade you forget your place, didn't I?""


The office door slammed shut with a bang. I stood there, numb to the physical pain.


Because the pain in my body was nothing compared to the agony in my chest.


Five years of promises had just turned to ash in a single moment.


All the hardships I'd endured with him, the sleepless nights, the sacrifices‚Äîit was all a fucking joke.


""Oh my God, what's gotten into Mr. Pierce? He never treated Secretary Rivers like this before.""


""I know, right? So brutal. Honestly, I always thought he and Secretary Rivers were a couple! Never saw this coming.""


""Guess we really can't fantasize about the boss. Someone like him would never notice ordinary girls like us anyway.""


The other employees whispered and pointed at me like I was some kind of spectacle. I ignored them all, wiped the blood from my mouth, and headed to the break room to make coffee.


""Mrs. Pierce, your coffee.""


I placed the cup on her desk. Isabella lifted it to her lips and immediately winced.


""It's scalding! Secretary Rivers, are you doing this on purpose? Getting revenge for me slapping you?""


""I'll make another one.""


I brought her a fresh cup. This time Isabella barely touched it before setting it down.


""Now it's too cold. No sincerity at all! Secretary Rivers, I know you're upset about earlier, but that was your boss's orders. As his personal secretary, you can't even make proper coffee?""


Before the words were fully out of her mouth, Nathan suddenly grabbed the coffee cup and hurled it directly at me.


""Jade, can't you handle one simple task?""


I dodged just in time, watching the cup shatter against the wall in an explosion of glass and coffee.


Fragments and hot liquid splattered across my clothes and legs. A shard sliced into my calf, bright red blood immediately welling up.


It hurt like hell.


I took a deep breath and said quietly: ""I'll make Mrs. Pierce another cup.""


It took until the fifth cup before Isabella was finally satisfied.


Back at my desk, I looked down at the resignation letter I still hadn't turned in and laughed softly to myself.


Turns out, leaving Nathan Pierce was definitely the smartest decision I'd ever made.

1oh2v16,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1oh2v16/4_reasons_why_youre_shy_from_a_guy_who_used_to_be/,4 reasons why you're shy (from a guy who used to be chronically anxious),"You ever freeze up in class, at work, or when someone cute starts talking to you? That sudden self-awareness, the panic loop, the awkward body language, yeah, it‚Äôs not just you. I used to legit sweat through my shirt just ordering coffee. Over time, I realized that a lot of ‚Äúshyness‚Äù we feel isn‚Äôt random or just poor confidence. It‚Äôs a mix of social conditioning, cognitive distortions, and evolution. This post is not just based on my experience. I‚Äôve spent years digging into research, books, expert interviews, and YouTube deep dives. Too much advice out there is either surface-level fluff or TikTok dudes yelling ‚ÄúJust be alpha!‚Äù I‚Äôm not here for that.

This is the deeper stuff. If you relate, these four reasons will probably explain 95% of your social anxiety, and I‚Äôll share real tools that helped me break through.

1. **Your nervous system sees people as predators, not peers**

That shaky voice and stiff posture? Classic fight or flight. Social anxiety lights up your amygdala, the brain‚Äôs threat detector, the same way physical danger does. According to research from the National Institute of Mental Health, socially anxious people show hyperactivity in the parts of the brain responsible for threat response. It‚Äôs not ‚Äújust in your head‚Äù, your body thinks you‚Äôre under attack.

This gets worse if you grew up with judgment-heavy environments, strict parents, or had early experiences being bullied or excluded. Your brain linked ‚Äúattention‚Äù with ‚Äúdanger,‚Äù and now even compliments feel threatening.

Tip: Psychologist Dr. Judson Brewer talks about using mindfulness to calm these fight-or-flight reactions. It‚Äôs not about forcing yourself to be confident, it‚Äôs about rewiring your threat response over time. His TED Talk is short, and his app *Unwinding Anxiety* has science-backed tools that I found way more effective than ‚Äúpositive affirmations.‚Äù

2. **You think people are watching you more than they actually are**

There‚Äôs literally a name for this: the Spotlight Effect. A Cornell study found that people massively overestimate how much others notice their mistakes or awkwardness. So if you trip up on a word or your hands are shaking, you feel exposed. But the guy next to you probably didn‚Äôt notice, or forgot in five seconds.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) helps a lot here. It teaches you how to *reality-check* your assumptions. One quick trick I use: after a social interaction, ask yourself ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs one piece of evidence that supports the idea they were judging me?‚Äù Most times, there isn‚Äôt any.

3. **You‚Äôve never practiced social skills like a skill**

Shyness feels like a personality trait. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs more like a muscle you never trained. You may be shy simply because you never had safe practice environments to build fluency. That‚Äôs not a moral flaw. It‚Äôs like calling yourself bad at piano when you‚Äôve never touched a keyboard.

Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neuroscientist) explains how repeated exposure to mild social discomfort rewires your brain and builds confidence. This is called ‚Äúgraded exposure.‚Äù You don‚Äôt need to jump into public speaking. Just start small, ask someone for the time, compliment a stranger‚Äôs shoes, etc.

Tip: I used an app called *Fortune* during my low-confidence phase. It gives you quick daily social challenges (like compliment a barista, ask a question in a Zoom meeting) and tracks your progress. Feels like a social gym.

4. **You‚Äôve unconsciously built an identity around being ‚Äúthe shy one‚Äù**

This was the hardest one for me to admit. After years of being the quiet kid, the good listener, the *observant one*, my ego kind of liked it. It gave me a role. And dropping that meant I had to risk becoming someone I didn‚Äôt recognize.

Dr. Nicole LePera (The Holistic Psychologist) calls this a ‚Äúnervous system identity.‚Äù You unconsciously return to the familiar stress pattern because it feels safe, even if it sucks. The solution is practice, yes, but also grieving the old version of yourself a little. You are not your shyness.

This book helped me break that loop.

**1. ‚ÄúThe Courage to Be Disliked‚Äù by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga**  
This Japanese bestseller changed how I think about identity. It dismantles the belief that your past defines you. It made me face how I *chose* certain patterns because they protected me. Sounds harsh, but freeing. Also: it‚Äôs written like a conversation between a student and a philosopher, so it‚Äôs super readable. Easily the best book on overcoming internalized shyness and social roles.

**2. ‚ÄúPresence‚Äù by Amy Cuddy**  
She‚Äôs a Harvard social psychologist. We all know her from the viral power pose TED Talk, but the book goes deeper. It‚Äôs *not* about faking it till you make it. It‚Äôs about understanding how posture, breath, and self-perception change how you show up, even before you speak. After finishing it, I started correcting my posture in anxious moments and immediately felt less foggy.

**3. Try to make learning addictive**  
I found that I retained social skills better when I listened to small audio lessons daily, like while brushing teeth or walking to work. The *Blinkist* app turns books into 15-minute audios. It‚Äôs a great shortcut to get exposure to social psych ideas fast.

**4. I recommend checking out this app called BeFreed**  
This app is lowkey genius. It‚Äôs an AI-powered learning tool built by experts from Columbia. You tell it you‚Äôre working on social anxiety or confidence, and it turns books, podcasts, expert talks, even Reddit threads, into personalized podcast-style learning, made just for your goals. Like, you can choose if you want a deep dive or a 10-minute sprint. Super helpful when you don‚Äôt have time to read full books.

It also asks how you felt about each session, then builds a learning roadmap that evolves with your mindset. It even recommended *The Courage to Be Disliked* to me before I knew about it, and then later put me onto Amy Cuddy‚Äôs work and the Huberman podcast. The book and podcast libraries are wild, like having a personalized professor who knows all the best research for your specific fear. 

**5. Podcast rec: ‚ÄúThe Psychology of Your 20s‚Äù**  
Hosted by Gemma Leigh Roberts, this show is surprisingly deep. The episode on social anxiety totally called me out. She breaks down how identity, culture, and even parenting style influence why we fear being seen. And she‚Äôs not preachy. Just well-researched, accessible, and honest.

**6. YouTube to check: Patrick Teahan, LICSW**  
If you‚Äôve ever tied your shyness to childhood stuff but don‚Äôt want to do full-on therapy yet, his breakdowns are gold. No BS, but still super trauma-informed. His video ‚ÄúAdult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents‚Äù explains why some of us *learned* to be invisible to stay safe.

These tools didn‚Äôt work overnight. But stacking them, one by one, changed the game. Being shy isn‚Äôt a flaw. It‚Äôs just untrained social confidence plus some confused brain wiring. Once you understand the *real reasons*, you can stop blaming your personality, and start building new habits instead.",1,1761531571.0,OdysseyBookClub,0,1.0,False
1oh2tsj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1oh2tsj/i_screwed_up_two_backtoback_dates/,I screwed up | two back-to-back dates,"I (18F) (bi) was asked on a coffee date with A(18F), around a week ago. I had only spoken with her online, so this was going to be our first official meetup. A few days later, a guy from my class W(18M) asks me to hangout for coffee. The coffee shop was attached to our library so I figured it was like any of the other study meet ups we had done in the library. This hangout works out to be the day before the date with A. All goes well, I don't think much of it.

Fast forward to yesterday (the date with A). W casually mentions half an hour before the date with A that the hangout the day before was in fact a date as well. Not only was it a¬†*date,*¬†but he then began acting like we were¬†*dating?*¬†This was news to me. Prior to this, we would text a bit, and chat in class - strictly about assignments.

I'm freaking out at this point because I'm very confused and still have my date with A in 30 minutes. I ended up going on this date I couldn't cancel in such short notice. I had such a great time! She was seriously amazing. We were out for about 3 hours - getting coffee and walking around the park. I had never had a first date that had gone so well. We ended off on great terms - where she gave me a hug and suggested we chat soon to make further plans. She messaged me once she got home as well to say she had a great time.

But here was the problem! Now everything was one big jumbled mess. W was under the impression that the day before was a date. While I hadn't previously really considered that, I started to then. He was awesome. Everything about him is cool - plus we are in all of the same classes together anyway.

All of this has been driving me a little crazy - and I'm not sure where to even go from here. So far, I've just been freaking out in my room haha.",1,1761531473.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

i'd see someone give a presentation without their voice shaking or start a conversation with a stranger like it was nothing, and i genuinely thought they were just... built different?

but then i realized something kinda wild: they weren't¬†*feeling*¬†confident. they were just¬†*acting*¬†confident. and their brain eventually caught up.

but here's the thing:: you can't just wing it. you gotta practice this stuff daily before you're actually in those situations. like literally rehearse it. i started using apps to help me build the habit (**i can drop some of them if anyone needs them**), and it made such a difference having that structure. tbh they do not help directly, but they help you build this as an habit..

so i started testing it. small stuff at first walking into coffee shops like i belonged there instead of apologizing for existing. saying my order clearly instead of mumbling. making myself speak up in meetings even when my heart was literally pounding.

it felt SO fake at first. like i was cosplaying as a secure person. i remember forcing myself to maintain eye contact during conversations and my brain was just screaming the entire time.

the more i did it, the less fake it felt. my body started believing the act. like i tricked my nervous system into thinking ""oh we do this now, this is normal""

now i can do things that used to terrify me and barely think twice about it. give presentations. disagree with people. exist in public without a constant anxiety soundtrack.

turns out ""**fake it till you make it**"" is just exposure therapy in disguise.

I‚Äôve kept going with my transition, and honestly, so much has changed since then. Remember the guy who used to make those bed jokes? I eventually gave him a chance. We didn‚Äôt just end up in bed, but we started going out‚Äîcoffee after shifts, lunch breaks together, thrifting dates. For a while, it felt nice. I thought maybe this was what it felt like to finally be seen, to be wanted not out of curiosity but out of genuine attraction.

But as time went on, things took a turn. I started to realize he didn‚Äôt really want me. He wanted to have me. I became something to show off, a sort of trophy that made him feel proud of himself. He began to control little things‚Äîwhat I wore, who I talked to, how I presented myself. It was subtle at first, but it grew heavier, and before I knew it, I was walking on eggshells around someone who claimed to love me.

It broke me more than I expected. I thought I‚Äôd found something safe, something grounding, but it turned out to be the opposite. Ending it was painful, but necessary. I‚Äôve been slowly rebuilding‚Äîtrying to find myself again beneath all the noise he left behind.

If there‚Äôs one thing I‚Äôve learned, it‚Äôs this: being desired isn‚Äôt the same as being valued. Some people will be drawn to you because of how you look, or what you represent to them, not who you are. It‚Äôs hard to face that, especially when you‚Äôve spent years craving to just be seen. But I‚Äôm learning that peace and self-worth mean more than validation from someone who only sees the surface.

To anyone who might go through something like this‚Äîplease, don‚Äôt settle for attention that costs you your peace. The right people will see you for your heart, not just your reflection.

I just want to know WHY this is happening and what people's theories might be.

Now, I dont really drink coffee. but as an employee at Dunkin, I get free coffee while im working my shift. Because of this I have recently started to drink it pretty casually.

However, I've noticed that halfway through my drink my head gets ""fuzzy"" and I get sort of sleepy. At first I wrote this off as just having too much caffeine. But then a couple days later i had a monster energy and did not feel the same fuzziness that i did when drinking the coffee.

So I conducted a little experiment.
I waited 2 days and drank an energy drink, nothing.
2 more days, coffee. Fuzzy.
2 more days, energy drink. Nothing.
2 more, coffee, still fuzzy.

So i think that proves its not the caffeine. 

My question is, if it's not the caffeine that makes me feel this way, then what could it be??

I‚Äôm a 30F postdoc researcher working remotely for at least the next 18 months, making about 61k a year. I currently live with my family in the Bay Area, CA, but after three years (and with two cats), I really want my own space again.

I‚Äôve lived in the LA area and in Minneapolis, MN, so I‚Äôve experienced both coasts and the Midwest. I loved the fall and early winter in Minnesota, those cozy Hallmark movie vibes, but the deep winters were rough.

In an ideal world, I‚Äôd live in Santa Cruz. I love the redwoods, the ocean drives, and the calm energy there. Being close enough to drive home to visit family would be great too, but it‚Äôs just not realistic on my income right now.

So I‚Äôm looking into places in the PNW like Oregon, Washington, or even Northern California, and honestly I‚Äôm stumped. Here‚Äôs a bit about me and what I‚Äôm hoping to find:

- I‚Äôd like to make friends and have some kind of community

- I like board games, yoga, baking for people, watching TV, and being cozy

- I'm generally trying to live a healthy lifestyle

- I‚Äôd love to meet someone eventually but it‚Äôs not my main goal

- I like the outdoors but more in a ‚Äúmedium-chill hike and scenic drive‚Äù way

- I really appreciate a good cafe or bookstore to hang out or work in

- I‚Äôm not a big drinker but will have a drink socially, same with marijuana

- Ideally Asian food is available but I could live without for a year lol

- I‚Äôm all about hygge and a warm, comfortable home. I love when it rains or snows because this is the best opportunity for peak coziness. 

A few practical things:
- Budget is ideally 1400 a month for rent but less is better

- I have a car but like having walkable areas nearby

- I want somewhere that feels safe (esp as a woman) and not too isolated

- Hoping to move in the next 6 to 9 months and stay a year or so

If you live in or know of a place in the PNW that fits this kind of vibe, especially somewhere friendly and affordable with a bit of nature and good coffee shops, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts. I'm open to other places, even international.

1oh2ep1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oh2ep1,Signed Book 241: The Arab Uprisings: Revisiting a Region I Once Knew.,"After yesterday‚Äôs book on art as a form of raising one‚Äôs voice, I somehow found my hands reaching for another where people raised theirs for change;  Jeremy Bowen‚Äôs ""The Arab Uprisings: The People Want the Fall of the Regime.""

I‚Äôve always admired Bowen‚Äôs calm yet compelling voice on BBC, and reading him felt like hearing that same voice narrate in my head, sharp, humane, and deeply observant. His fastpaced, journalistic storytelling took me through Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Syria, explaining why these uprisings happened and what they led to.
But for me, the book wasn‚Äôt just about revolutions. It was deeply personal. It brought back vivid memories of my own travels through these places between 2003 and 2005, the warmth of the people, the smell of coffee in Tunisia, the vibrancy of Cairo markets, and the quiet dignity of those I met in Syria. Syrians, in particular, were among the most welcoming souls I‚Äôve ever met, kind, curious, and full of life. Two handwoven 'Syrian carpets' still adorn my home, and while reading Bowen‚Äôs descriptions of the civil war, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder what happened to those gentle people who sold them to me. Are they still around? Are their homes still standing?

Bowen takes you through, Bouazizi‚Äôs desperate act of self immolation in Tunisia, the euphoria of Tahrir Square, and the tragic descent of Syria into chaos. He interviews everyone from protesters and politicians to clerics and ordinary citizens, capturing the pulse of an entire region caught between hope and heartbreak.
What I appreciated most was how readable it all was, even without being a political junkie, you can follow every thread. Bowen doesn‚Äôt just inform, he makes you feel,  the uncertainty, the exhaustion, and that fleeting moment when people believed change was truly possible.
By the end, I wasn‚Äôt just turning the last page, I was sitting quietly, remembering faces, voices, and stories from my own time there. It‚Äôs rare for a book to blend news, nostalgia, and empathy this seamlessly.
And of course, a big thanks to my trusted Instagram based preloved bookseller @bookhub_01 for this lovely copy, every parcel from them seems to come with a little adventure of its own.

1oh29s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1oh29s6/roommate_moves_out_over_6/,"""Roommate"" moves out over $6","So I just read a post on here that reminded me of this. 

My freshman year of college I (currently 26f) became really close with this girl, let's call her Avery. She and I were the same age, same major, and we had almost everything in common. We immediately became the best of friends, and that quickly became extremely toxic for many reasons. We had the same opinions on almost everything, but the things we disagreed on? They became huge deals even if they weren't. She was one of those people who, if she didn't like someone, you weren't allowed to like that person either. If she thought a song was great, you had to think that song was great too. If I expressed anything that differed from her, a big blowout would ensue. But I had also never felt closer to someone, literally never met someone who was so like me in so many ways aside from what seemed to me like ? Jealousy? Maybe? I still don't really know.

Anyway, about 3/4 of the way through my freshman year, she has a big blowout on me because she finds out I like the show Sex Education, and she thinks that show is racist because it has no POC characters. I tell her it does, in fact, have POC characters, quite a few of them. Apparently that was the last straw for her (lol) because she cut me off for this comment even and we didn't talk for nearly 7 months.

Fast forward to November the following year, I randomly get a long dm from Avery saying how sorry she is, how much she misses me, how she wishes she could make it right. I'm immediately accepting because I'm a forgiving ass person to a fault (trauma response). We meet up a week later, get matching tattoos, and instantly we're hanging out every day all day again like nothing ever happened. In fact she's even more close and supportive and less argumentative than before. Everything is great.

Suddenly, her car breaks down. She also just got fired from her job the week before. She lives in the middle of nowhere with her awful grandmother, I live 2 hours away in the city. I tell her, come live with me until you can get on your feet. I know what it's like to have nothing going for you in a small town with no way to get around.

She moves in with me, no job, no savings, no car. She's been at my place for a week, job hunting online, when all of a sudden she has a ""medical emergency"" - usually I wouldn't downplay something like that but she really never had any paperwork or evidence of what she claimed to be dealing with and her symptoms would come and go whenever it was most convenient for her, it seemed. She isn't going to be able to work for at least a few weeks.

So I am paying for everything. I never asked her for rent money, because it was never meant to be a permanent thing. I'm buying her food, taking her to appointments, paying her phone bill. For 2 months. Finally, I said enough. I got her an interview at my retail job, and she got hired. Then she missed the first week and a half of work for another ""medical emergency"" and I had to cover her shifts. At this point I was getting annoyed.

After a couple months of working there, calling out at least once a week and making me look terrible because I recommended her!!!! She gets off a few hours before me one night. I ask her to pick up stuff for dinner. She does.

I get home and she immediately hits me with ""you need to send me $12 for groceries."" I look at the receipt sitting inside the bag, the total for the entire grocery haul was $12 and some change. Mind you, this is not a lot of money. I could easily send it. But I have also been paying for everything for this girl for almost 5 months at this point and even though she's had a job for months, I'm still paying her way for everything. I even paid the full adoption fee for the cat we adopted together - remember this, it's important later. I've given her a place to live, a job, food, w33d, a CAT, friendship, morning coffees I couldn't afford, and she's gonna ask me to cover the entire 12 fucking dollar dinner????? Like girl. I was over it.

I told her I would send her $6 because that was half, and she was also eating the food. She began to moan and groan about how she was awful and absolutely ridiculous for expecting to get reimbursed, how she should never ask for anything ever again and she's just the worst friend ever. All in that sarcastic ""feel bad for me"" tone of voice. I stood there and said, ""No, I don't think you understand. You are a LEECH.""

She immediately got up and tried to fight me, luckily I shoved her off and got up to my room and locked the door. I listened as she packed her stuff and left, she called a friend to come get her because again, no car lol. When I went downstairs after she had left, I discovered that the cat that I paid to adopt was gone - she stole my fucking cat. I don't care that she's the one that found the cat. I paid for her, she's my baby. I've still never seen my poor kitty to this day, almost 5 years later.

Turns out she ended up going to live with the friend who came to pick her up, who lived with her boyfriend of nearly 3 years at the time. Within a month, that friend was HOMELESS and Avery was still living in that apartment, dating the friend's boyfriend. They ended up getting engaged and moving to Florida before breaking it off, from what I hear. Good riddance.

So I only have one lip balm open at any given time. I recently panned my other lip balm I was using. I was gifted a Summer Fridays lip balm a few months ago, so I picked it from my stash (new and unopened). Shade: Iced Coffee

Love that they are vegan and cruelty free.

However I am extremely disappointed in the product. My initial reaction was: ""that.....that's it?"" 

Why is this product so hyped? The lip balm is so underwhelming. It's not cushiony at all. **It's so THIN**. It rubs off after 30 seconds and I have to reapply. It smells okay, but imo too much fragrance and smells too much like a waxy candle. It doesn't hit the right balance. Other lip balm brands don't make their scent so overwhelming. 

The shade is whatever. I'm not mad at it. It's barely there. It's almost like wearing a clear, or sheer nude. I think I would have liked Brown Sugar better since that one looks more pigmented. But the shade is fine for Fall. 

The quality of the balm, which is what's most important to me, sucks ass. I've tried a lot of balms and I would rank this one pretty low. About 15 minutes after applying it in my car, I got to the elevators and had to peel the skin off my lips because it actually made them flake. 

In the span of 1 hour I had to reapply 3 times. Between walking to my car and getting to the elevators inside the building I had to re-apply. 

People who say they prefer summer fridays over brands like lanaige or olehenriksen are just straight up lying. 

This lip balm is doo-doo. It's ass cheeks. I will have to quickly hate pan it so I can move on to another product in my stash.

I was interested in trying other products in this brand. But now that I've tried this balm I have a feeling their other products are equally underwhelming. And it's just the millions dumped into social media marketing that is driving this brand's hype because the quality in the product is not there. I will personally never purchase another Summer Fridays lippie ever in the future based on this experience/review.",4,1761529621.0,Sephora,6,0.67,False

Wife I and (34M & 35F) have been married for 8.5 years and together for 16 years. During college can very much see the honeymoon phase now, to then moving in together being a liter honeymoon phase. We eventually bought a house and got married. Few years later our son came along (5M currently) with now our daughter (18 month F).

As I saw a similar trend with our son I honestly thought we would be back to ‚Äúdating‚Äù one another again about this time but it hasn‚Äôt flipped. I am being patient but also getting more and more annoyed. I feel less seen as a partner and more of a roommate who does 80% of the house stuff. I also feel as if I put much more into keep any type spark alive. For anniversary, Valentines, Birthdays, Xmas and even Mother‚Äôs Day I carefully find meaningful gifts and put 100% into them, even blowing budget if it means I get a great gift. While for her side it‚Äôs maybe a coffee mug or something I was already eyeing to buy myself. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I still love what she has gotten me but I feel as I put S Tier effort while I get B/C back. I know I should think financially either but looking back I have put WAY more into this, do I mind no as this is the women and family I love. 

For intimacy though this is where it‚Äôs starting to hurt. When I define ‚Äúintimacy‚Äù I am not just saying sex but cuddles or a longing touch, hell I take a ‚Äúthis was a great dinner you cooked‚Äù. I feel less seen as a partner, husband or even just a relationship and more of a roommate who we are just good friends. We don‚Äôt cuddle/snuggle at all in bed anymore, site separately on the couch. Do feel 75% of our sex life feels ‚Äúroutine‚Äù and kind of boring. When she DOES initiate its WAY better but again that is a rare occurrence. Even when she initiates it‚Äôs not much effort, example other night I came in from bedtime and she was already in give up pjs to ask ‚Äúwanna do stuff?‚Äù, as normal my switch flipped but before I wasn‚Äôt. There also wasn‚Äôt much effort, like no lingerie or sexy talk or anything. Like ‚Äúhey, haven‚Äôt had sex in a bit wanna do this?‚Äù. I said yes bc it had been a while and was freaky horny to take advantage of every second of that. 

 Honesty, due to all this my Lobito has tanked and the roommate thing falls more into play. Mentally I am all over the place, I am working on this via therapy on my own, but I don‚Äôt know if I should even suggest couples therapy for a safe place for both of us to talk about things. I guess I‚Äôm just tired of being invisible in my own home without needing a significant life event to happen. 

Not asking for sex every night or anything like that but just to be seen and acknowledged again. Maybe even occasionally a snuggle at night or even some playful flirting again. Those who have been in long term relationships with kids how did you all do it?

I come to you in a time of need. 2 years ago I bought the Boy Smells holiday collection (the little minis they had) & was immediately obsessed with Spiritous. I bought a full size immediately after purchasing the mini. I love it - I've used it sparingly for the last two years, hoping it will come back. After the new BS rebrand & the Christmas scents this year, I do fear it is never coming back. I am here to beg and plead for a dupe... as close as I can get. Even if I have to burn two candles at once, I would do it for this candle. I love it so much. 

The notes are:¬†

top: ginger, cassis, and carnation

middle: davana, saffron blossom, and balsam

base: coffee, patchouli, vetiver, and labdanum

Every kind of scent I can find does not involve most of these notes. Obviously, I have not succeeded in my mission. My hope through this post is to find either: (1) a perfect/close enough dupe for Spiritous that is ideally not limited edition, (2) a description of these scents in a scent profile so I can understand what I like and explore within that family, or (3) a kind soul who somehow acquired a 10000 Spiritous candles and wants to part with them.

I cannot overstate how perfect this scent is. I think there is not a single scent in this entire world that is this incredible. The floral and the spice and the warmth and the sweetness and the vegetalness? I can't believe they are never going to bring this candle back. It actually makes me sick thinking of how this rebrand has taken away this scent from me. BS I will never forgive you.

This last 6 months has been hell.   

1. First I had to stop drinking coffee as it caused a gluten type reaction.  The coffee was non flavored coffee freshly ground at home. Small chance of contamination and not the same bean source.   No problem with tea of any type.  Sucks but change and adapt.

2. I am a pepper head and grow 6 or 7 types of hot peppers (hottest is Ghost down to mild peppers).   Next thing I am gluten response from any heat of pepper.  Sad.

3. Now I eat almost anything, and I get diarrhea and mucus.

Basically very bland very careful diet for the last month while using metamucil to limit the diarrhea.


I skip metamucil one day and same mucus and diarrhea.

1oh217r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Discipline/comments/1oh217r/the_morning_routine_that_changed_my_life_its/,The morning routine that changed my life (it's simpler than you think),"Six months ago, my mornings were  a chaos. I'd wake up, immediately check my phone, scroll for 20 minutes, then rush to get ready feeling already behind. By 10 AM, I was exhausted. By afternoon, I was running on fumes. I thought that's just how life was.

Then I changed my morning routine. Nothing crazy, nothing complicated. Just five simple things that took 30 minutes total.

It completely changed how I feel every single day.

**Here's what I do now:**

**1. No phone for the first 30 minutes (6:00-6:30 AM)**

This was the hardest one. My phone used to be the first thing I touched. Now it stays in another room until after my routine. Those 30 minutes are just for me. No emails, no notifications, no other people's problems.

**2. Drink a full glass of water (6:00 AM)**

Your body is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. I keep a water bottle on my nightstand and drink it before anything else. Sounds too simple to matter, but it wakes up my body better than coffee.

**3. Move for 10 minutes (6:05-6:15 AM)**

Not a full workout. Just stretching, a short walk, or some push-ups. Anything to get my blood moving. It signals to my brain: ""We're awake. We're doing things today.""

**4. Write down three priorities (6:15-6:20 AM)**

Just three things I want to accomplish today. Not a massive to-do list, just three. This keeps me focused instead of reacting to whatever fires pop up.

**5. Read or journal for 10 minutes (6:20-6:30 AM)**

Sometimes I read a few pages of a book. Sometimes I write down thoughts. Either way, it's quiet time for my brain to think instead of consume.

**What changed:**

I used to feel like I was chasing my day. Now I feel like I'm leading it. My energy is more stable. I'm less reactive. I actually get important stuff done instead of just urgent stuff. Most surprisingly, I'm calmer. Those 30 minutes of intentional morning time set the tone for everything else.

**The mistakes I made at first:**

I tried to wake up at 5 AM immediately. That lasted two days. Start with your current wake time, just change what you do first.

I tried to do too much. Started with just water and no phone for a week. Then added one thing at a time.

I beat myself up when I missed a day. Now I just get back to it the next morning. Consistency matters more than perfection.

**Six months later:**

This simple 30-minute routine changed how I feel about my entire life. I'm more focused, less stressed, and actually enjoying my days instead of just surviving them.

It's not about becoming some ultra-productive machine. It's about feeling like you're in control of your own time.

Try it for one week. Just one. See how different your days feel.

1oh1obj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1oh1obj/austin_tx_pourovers_trip_report/,"Austin, TX - Pourovers Trip report","In addition to my previous Houston trip report, also swung by Austin based largely off the recommendations I found searching this sub.

My primary conclusion is that there's a lot happening with the Austin Coffee scene, and it's not really that reflected from what others have stated here.

* Proud Mary - First we'll start with Proud Mary, which is basically synonymous to Austin in this sub. What I didn't realize (and hopefully someone mentioned this) is that Proud Mary is actually more of a restaurant rather than a coffee shop. While you can get coffee there, it may not be the focus of the person running the station at the time. They definitely have the most premium selection of coffees, but they're not doing anything special (or at least the barista for me) to adjust for each different brew - it's a standardized long bloom and then single pour like a modified Hedrick method on v60. Proud Mary is great if you have rich friends who can afford the $12-60 per cup and are looking for that Mastro's type corporate-ized ""specialty"" coffee experience

* Flora Coffee - I only found this place mentioned once on this sub, and the poster mentions the owner (DJ), but I had the pleasure of being served by Tristan. Flora is the secret diamond in the rough of Austin that nobody knows about, and most people in this sub should prioritize visiting. According to Tristan, the cafe experience has 3 parts to it - the quality of the bean, the skill of the barista, and then the in cafe experience you have with the barista; Flora is seeking to maximize all 3 of these. Aside from Proud Mary, every place I visited in Austin only had 1-2 pourover choices for the most part, but Flora had 4. When I tried the Tanzanian, I noticed a supple and smooth mouthfeel that I'd associated with more premium coffee, and Tristan explained that it was due to some sort of acid (sorry forgot the name) which is prevalent in Tanzanian coffees but not really well known. He also freely admitted that the shop had not managed to dial in the brew for this coffee, so he actually brewed it twice and solicited my opinion on both for what they should do. This was a top notch experience. If you read this Tristan, I give you an 11/10. I liked Flora enough (and remembered the beans they had) to visit a second time and try a grape coferment they had. If you ordered the Juice Box B&W drop from Fellow and wanted more, their grape coferment was very similar to that and I would highly recommend. Of note for Flora is that they use lots of the prestige equipment that we talk about in this sub like a Zerno grinder, sibarist papers, etc.

* Desnudo - This is probably the 2nd most mentioned place on this sub for Austin. First if you're trying to go Thursday forget it cause they do some run club thing and there's like 200-300 people in line. When I returned on a Friday, I was informed that ""we don't do pourovers on weekends."" With some polite begging, (and since it wasn't busy) I was luckily able to convince them to still brew a cup - unfortunately it was a take it or leave it with something that I think they called Guava Papaya. Unfortunately, this was the single worst cup of coffee I've had this year as it was a full on acid bomb. While it's really harsh to judge them on something that they did to me as a favor, let's just say given the run club they seem to have ""gone commercial"" with something that may have previously been more niche and specialized. Will have to re-evaluate again in the future. The coffee was $8

* Fleet - this was next door to Desnudo and I basically tried to get a cup from both places to compare. Coffee was $7 and was at least drinkable. It wasn't really memorable in any way, but it was adequate. For anyone who is not willing to wait for a Desnudo line this is a great substitute. I will say that their tables (outdoors) were fairly disgusting since they don't seem to be cleaned at all. You could see all sorts of small food particles stuck to them and bugs were rampant.

* De Medici - They had 2 choices of beans for pourover, but when looking at the available beans it seemed like their choices were more like the mid range beans and the premium roasts were for beans only. The cup cost $8 and was well brewed. Their beans/roast seemed to lack character though since it was more mid range it was more of an easy to drink coffee vs anything memorable.

* Houndstooth - A lot of people complained about this one previously, but I found that of the ""more corporate"" experiences in Austin it was streamlined to the point where I appreciated it for being closer to starbucks more than say a Desnudo that had none of the character. Both the reserve coffee (even though it wasn't a pour over) and the reserve espresso were really well made and appropriately enjoyable given the circumstances.

* Klerje Coffee (sounds like Clergy) - I wonder how many people looked for this and didn't find it due to the spelling of the name. This was another boutique cafe that focused on the full service experience. They rotate their selection of pourovers (one day there was 4 but they sold out the next and it was down to 2), and they source from different roasters like Perc, so what you get might be random on any given day. In terms of the cafe experience they are definitely doing something right - while the owner, Justin, was who I mostly interacted with, as I sat and watched the flow of things there was a barista named Lia that people specifically came to see. About 25% of the customers knew Lia by name and made it a point to say hello to her - one customer even refused to be served until Lia was the one to pull her shot. In terms of the coffee, they did correctly dial in the coffees but since there is some loss in control with how they source the quality does seem a bit uneven since some of the sourced beans could just not be the best. Overall I'd highly recommend Klerje as well and its location may be a little easier for people closer to downtown. The pourovers were also $8

Overall it was a great trip! There's definitely more to Austin coffee than Proud Mary, and I do think that the shops that are offering the full service barista experience have something that sets them apart. I'd highly recommend people in this sub check out Flora and Klerje, perhaps even more than Proud Mary.

No Ivy League degree. No VC funding.
Just a guy sitting in a tiny apartment in Ohio with a cracked laptop and a dream too stubborn to die.

While his friends traded crypto and chased quick flips,

selling reusable coffee cups and bamboo toothbrushes to anyone who‚Äôd listen.

He called it ‚ÄúGreenify.‚Äù
At first, it was a joke among his friends ‚Äî
‚ÄúBro, no one‚Äôs paying $15 for a metal straw.‚Äù

An eco-influencer on TikTok unboxed his product.
One viral video later ‚Äî 7,000 orders. Sold out in two days.

The night he realized ‚Äî ecommerce wasn‚Äôt just about selling products.
It was about solving problems.

So he doubled down.
He added zero-waste skincare, refillable cleaning pods, organic pet food, and even solar-powered gadgets.
Every product had one purpose ‚Äî make daily life sustainable without making it boring.

A year later, his store was pulling six figures a month.

Imagine waking up after 8 years of ""us,"" staring at an empty coffee mug, wondering if you'll ever feel steady again. At 54M, that's where I landed when she (48F) drifted out‚Äîno fireworks, just a soft ""it's not there."" I blamed myself hard: Too distant, too wrapped in work. 

Months of fog, replaying every missed hug. Relatable? That hollow ""who am I now?"" hit like a wave. But then, self-growth clicked‚Äînot as a chore, but as my quiet rebellion.

I dove in, small and stubborn. Coached a 35M friend through his 4-year split last year; he borrowed this hack and texted me last week: ""Dude, I'm dating someone who sees me‚Äîfeels easy."" No fluff, just real shifts that built me from inside out. If you're piecing yourself back, these steps turned my ""broken"" to ""built."" Honest, doable, one day at a time.

Start with Mirror Mornings: 5 minutes facing yourself‚Äîsay ""I'm enough, just as I am."" Sounds simple? It quieted my doubt storm. Follow with one ""me move"": A walk alone, a new recipe. I picked guitar strums; fingers fumbled, but confidence stuck.

Layer in Lesson Logs: Nightly note‚Äîwhat sparked joy today? What old pattern snuck in? No beat-up, just notice. Mine revealed people-pleasing roots; uprooted 'em gently. Buddy logged his; stopped chasing ""fixes,"" started attracting equals.

Stack the Sparks: Weekly one ""scary fun"" thing‚Äîcoffee with a stranger, hobby class. I joined a trail group; met folks who matched my pace. Builds the energy that pulls good in, not pushes it away.

Own the Wins Wall: Pin 3 ""I did that"" notes (nailed a work call? Laughed solo?). Visual reminder you're mid-rise. Friend wall-ed his; turned ""lost her"" to ""found my stride.""

Close with Quiet Vision: 10 minutes dreaming ""me in 6 months""‚Äîvibrant, open, loved right. I sketched it; the path lit up. No force, just flow.

That ache? It's the old skin shedding for something fiercer. You're not ""after her""‚Äîyou're before your best. One hack at a time, you'll stand taller, love deeper. Gals and guys, what's the self-growth move that cracked your shell open? Share below‚Äîlet's celebrate the climbs.

TL;DR: 54M after 8-year drift shares 5 growth hacks: Mirror mornings, lesson logs, spark stacks, wins wall, quiet vision. Helped a friend attract better. Your move?

Grateful for you all‚Äîone layer lighter.

1oh1jiy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutInCoffee/comments/1oh1jiy/outin_mino_review/,Outin Mino Review,"**Packaging & Unboxing**

https://imgur.com/l312RRS

* Upon opening the box ‚Äì I was impressed how well designed the packaging was. Every thing in the box had a slot to hold it secure. 
* Accessories included (to list a few): 

* Nespresso pod adapter
* Carrying bag
* 12g espresso basket
* USB-C Charger




**Ease of Setup**

* After doing a quick glance at the manual I was ready to pull my first shot. I had some idea how it works due to the number of videos I have watched of the original Nano. 
* The sticker instructions right by the button was a nice touch! 
* I ground up 12g of Robusta espresso beans (roasted a few days before) was pleasantly surprised that I did not have to change the grind setting of my Eureka Mignon. I was unsure whether I needed to grind coarser due to the difference in machines being used but no adjustments needed. A++
* I was happy to see that I was able to pull a shot straight into the cup without needing the stand accessory or holding the brewer. This is definitely a well thought out and appreciated feature to the overall design of the Mino. 

**Design & Usability**

* The Mino build quality is top notch. It‚Äôs got some weight to it that doesn‚Äôt feel like a toy. But is light enough for portability. It‚Äôs about the size of your standard insulated coffee tumbler (just not as tall) 
* The additional rubber on the unit to help with grip is the perfect size. Not too little or too big.
* The overall body of the Mino is plastic. The basket and water reservoir are stainless steel. 
* Cleaning couldn‚Äôt easier. After pulling a shot, I rinsed everything under warm water and also pulled a shot of just water to flush the system. Pat dry and it‚Äôs ready for the next shot. 
* I‚Äôve looked into other portable espresso machines in the past. And I really like that the Mino has a built in rechargeable battery. I‚Äôve looked at machines like that Wacaco Picopresso (which requires manual pumping ‚Äì I know they have since released Pixapresso). Also looked into something like Bellman CX25P but that requires an external heat source which isn‚Äôt ideal at all times. The Mino addresses both those limitations. 

**Coffee Quality Comparison**

* Taste & Consistency: Given that both instances use different amount of ground espresso and shot timing ‚Äì they taste fairly identical. I didn‚Äôt taste anything different worth noting.
* Crema: See for yourself. It‚Äôs beautiful. Left is a 17g double shot from a Profitec Pro 500. Right is a 12g shot from the Outin Mino.

https://imgur.com/8mo9Aus

**Final Words**

* I am impressed at what the Mino can do especially considering the size of the unit. A game changer for espresso coffee lovers. Imagine being able to enjoy the beans you have at home ANYWHERE. But don‚Äôt think because it is marketed as portable ‚Äì that its only useful for people that travel a lot. No ‚Äì I can see the Mino for home setups too. If you casually want to enjoy an espresso once in a while and not want to invest thousands of dollars for a prosumer espresso machine ‚Äì this is for you. You‚Äôre not sure how to dial in the beans or don‚Äôt know how to? It‚Äôs okay ‚Äì they have included the Nespresso pod accessory out of the box. If you want something simple ‚Äì you can buy your favourite Nespresso pods and enjoy it on the go.
* I look forward future Outin products. Honestly - as a latte enjoyer - if Outin can create a milk frother/steamer in the same form factor. This will ultimately be the best portable coffee setup.",2,1761527714.0,OutInCoffee,1,1.0,False
