She told me it made her feel uncomfortable that I was a virgin. She said she felt like it was quite  grotesque that I was a virgin.

This isn't even my issue with my neighbour....well let me give the full history on this....I moved in to my current apartment  about a year ago....I never had an issue until my wife and kids moved from our country to join me here in Qatar. It all started with my wife saying that around odd times of the day.....someone would be kicking with demonic frenzy on our wall ( think of that scene in the movie Hereditary) lol, this would happen when I'm at work.....so I would always tend to think my wife is exaggerating or thinking it's some accident or whatever...couple months go by like this and my wife regularly tells me the same.....now I had a sudden shift in my work roster and I happened to have an off day....my kids are sound asleep and even when awake.....they are the most silent and well behaved girls ever that always play silently to themselves ( their room isn't even facing our neighbour......so back to the story....kids are asleep and me and my wife enjoy a cup of Turkish coffee silently, talking about news...some Quran recitation on TV......when suddenly that demonic kicking starts from nowhere BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM, with my whole kitchen wall shaking as if it's going to be tore down......my eyes go all wide open....surely this can't be a person doing this? .....kinda out of curiosity I knock back with my fist on our kitchen wall that's facing our neighbour....to see if it's maybe someone playing games....or some water pipe or engine making strange noises.......that's when I hear this demon psychos foot steps, first faintly running inside his apartment üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è then his apartment door open...then running steps towards my door , then that same previous kicking on the wall....but now on my door!!! Now to give you a background about myself....I'm a 6.2 guy that's been doing martial arts since early childhood *this f*ker didn't realise he just served himself to me like on a golden plate * I open the door and take up a inconspicuous fighting stance ( right leg behind left and right arm leaning on left playing with my chin( pretending to be curious but ready to move into a face guard if the situation necessitates).
I could tell straight away that this dude was Hella shocked....his eyes widened up and he went stunned for some seconds before his psycho ass started ranting again about us "" moving things around in our home and banging on things. Now I know that we are a very silent family and there's no sound ever coming from our home....I work full time as an engineer and my wife is very soft spoken as are my daughters.....our neighbour's however regularly have loud parties but this guy never did like this to them. Now I was ready to beat him to a pulp....like how the hell do you dare to beat on my walls...then come in only underwear and bang on my door!??? By some miracle sense prevailed over my mind in that moment and I reminded myself that if two residents get into a fight in qatar....both can be deported irrespective who was in the right.....I decide to take and report it to the police, which turned out to be a good thing. They forced him to sign a paper that he won't bother us anymore.....however this has left my wife scared for her safety when I'm not around, and this evil fuck....will still bang on the walls suddenly.....just only once or twice real loud , or suddenly slam his door with such force that our whole home shakes...but always att odd time and never long enough for us to be able to record it.....I wish for some advise on how to proceed......I have enough of shit to worry at In office.....I really didn't need all this extra drama after work as well.....",3,1738490689.0,qatar,0,1.0,False

Imagine yourself floating noiselessly over the apparently endless plains of the Serengeti, the sunbaked sky golden as herds of wildebeest, elephants, and giraffes roam beneath. That is a glimpse of what a Serengeti Balloon Safari can offer-a spectacle both breathtaking and surreal.

¬†

**What to Expect on a Balloon Safari**

* **Early Start:** The adventure begins before dawn with a pickup from your camp/lodge (around 4:30‚Äì5:00 AM).
* **Pre-Flight Prep:** You‚Äôll arrive at the launch site, sip on hot coffee, and watch as the massive balloon inflates.
* **Takeoff at Sunrise:** As the sun rises, you‚Äôll lift off into the sky, getting aerial views of Serengeti‚Äôs landscapes and wildlife.
* **Wild Life Viewing:** The season will decide whether you see lions on the hunt, elephants marching by herds, or even the Great Migration! Champagne Bush Breakfast: After an hour in the air, you land in the wilderness to enjoy a luxurious breakfast with champagne-a tradition in the Serengeti.

**Best Time to Go**

Year-round, but for the Great Migration:

* **Dec-March:** Southern Serengeti (calving season)
* **June‚ÄìJuly:** Western & Central Serengeti (Grumeti River crossings)
*  **Aug‚ÄìOct:** Northern Serengeti (Mara River crossings)

¬†

**How Much Does It Cost?**

* $550‚Äì$600 per person, flight included, breakfast, and transfers. It is expensive, but if you can afford it, it is 100% worth it!

¬†

**Is It Worth It?**

*  **Yes,** if you want a unique, once-in-a-lifetime safari experience.
* **Maybe not,** if you're on a tight budget-you can still enjoy amazing game drives.¬†

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Living in a blue barndominium is becoming an increasingly popular choice for many homeowners. These unique buildings combine modern comforts with rustic charm. A blue barndominium offers not only a cozy place to call home but also a striking aesthetic that stands out in any landscape. If you're considering this living style, here are some key benefits you should know about.

### Stunning Aesthetic Appeal

The vibrant blue exterior of a barndominium catches the eye and creates a beautiful focal point on your property. Whether you‚Äôre showcasing it in a rural setting or a suburban area, a blue barndominium can blend seamlessly with nature or make a bold statement. The combination of bright colors, the metal framework, and large windows enhance its visual appeal while offering a contemporary touch to traditional barn styles.

### Spacious Interiors

One of the standout features of a blue barndominium is its spacious interior. Unlike traditional homes that often feel cramped, a barndominium provides a wide-open floor plan. This open concept allows for versatile use of space. Here are some key advantages:

- **Flexible Layout:** You can design the space to fit your needs, whether it's a large family area, an entertainment space, or a creative studio.
- **High Ceilings:** Most barndominiums come with impressive ceiling heights, making rooms feel even more expansive.
- **Natural Light:** Large windows flood the space with natural light, promoting a cheerful, inviting atmosphere.

### Cost-Effective Living

Building a blue barndominium can be more cost-effective compared to traditional housing. The materials used in barndominiums, such as steel and metal, are often less expensive than conventional building materials. This can lead to significant savings during the construction phase. Additionally, many barndominiums are energy-efficient, helping you save on utility bills in the long run.

### Durability and Low Maintenance

Blue barndominiums are known for their durability. Typically constructed with metal siding, they resist harsh weather conditions, pests, and decay. This longevity means you won‚Äôt have to spend as much time or money on repairs. The low-maintenance characteristics allow you to enjoy your home without the constant upkeep usually associated with traditional houses.

### Customization Options

The flexibility in designing a blue barndominium is enticing for many. You can customize everything, from the layout to the interior finishes. Do you prefer an open kitchen layout with a large island or a cozy farmhouse style? You‚Äôve got options. You can also incorporate luxurious elements, like upscale flooring or high-end appliances, while still maintaining the rustic vibe that a barndominium provides.

### Community and Lifestyle

Living in a blue barndominium often means embracing a lifestyle that celebrates nature and community. Many barndominiums are situated in rural areas, allowing you to connect with your surroundings. You can enjoy outdoor activities, gardening, and possibly even farming. The sense of community in these areas can enhance your quality of life, allowing you to forge lasting friendships with neighbors who share your interests.

### Personal Expression

A blue barndominium allows you to express personal style and creativity through its design. Whether you opt for a minimalist aesthetic or a cozy, rustic look, you can tailor it to your preferences. The exterior color and structural style also allow you to express your individuality. This personalization can make your home feel more inviting and unique.

### Enhanced Property Value

Investing in a blue barndominium can also boost your property's value. Due to their unique style and functionalities, they are often sought after by buyers looking for something different. As more people become aware of the benefits of barndominiums, their market appeal may rise, making your investment even more sound.

Living in a blue barndominium brings a host of benefits that extend beyond its beautiful hue. From spacious, customizable interiors to cost-effective living, these homes foster both comfort and community. Whether you're drawn to their aesthetic appeal or their practicality, a blue barndominium might just be the perfect choice for your next home.

Designing Your Dream Blue Barndominium: Key Features to Consider
----------------------------------------------------------------

Embracing the charm of rustic living while enjoying modern comforts is the ideal scenario many people envision when thinking about a blue barndominium. This unique structure combines the practicality of a barn with the cozy layout of a traditional home, resulting in an inviting atmosphere. If you're looking to design your dream blue barndominium, there are several key features you should consider to make your vision a reality.

### Exterior Design Elements

The exterior of your blue barndominium sets the tone for the entire property. Here are essential aspects to take into account:

- **Color Scheme:** The iconic blue finish can vary from deep navy to softer pastel shades. Choose a hue that complements your surroundings and personal taste.
- **Roof Style:** A gabled roof not only adds to the classic barn look but also provides great drainage. Metal roofing options can enhance durability and energy efficiency.
- **Windows and Doors:** large windows allows natural light to flood the interior. Choose doors that fit the rustic theme, such as sliding barn doors or wooden front doors.

### Layout and Floor Plan

Creating a functional layout is crucial for your blue barndominium. Start by imagining how you intend to use the space. Consider these aspects:

- **Open Concept Living:** An open floor plan typically works best, allowing kitchen, dining, and living areas to flow together seamlessly.
- **Bedrooms:** Think about the number of bedrooms you need. You may decide to have a master suite that offers privacy with additional guest rooms nearby.
- **Bathrooms:** Plan for at least two bathrooms, ideally one being an en-suite for convenience.

### Interior Features

Inside your blue barndominium, the features and decor tell your personal story. Here are several elements to personalize your space:

- **Kitchen Design:** A rustic farmhouse sink paired with modern appliances creates a perfect contrast. Open shelving can bring a trendy touch.
- **Flooring:** Choose durable and easy-to-clean flooring options. Hardwood or laminate can give a warm and inviting feel.
- **Lighting:** Opt for pendant lights in the kitchen and soft recessed lighting throughout the home. Consider options that can enhance the rustic ambiance.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy-efficient solutions in your blue barndominium helps save money and reduces environmental impact. Key considerations include:

- **Insulation:** Proper insulation is essential in maintaining a comfortable temperature. Use high-quality materials that meet energy standards.
- **Windows:** Invest in energy-efficient windows that minimize heat loss during winter and keep the space cool in summer.
- **Heating and Cooling:** Installing a reliable HVAC system or considering in-floor heating can ensure consistent climate control.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Don‚Äôt forget to maximize your outdoor space. A well-designed exterior can enhance your lifestyle, providing areas for relaxation and entertainment:

- **Porches:** Large front porches can be great for enjoying morning coffee. They also add curb appeal to your blue barndominium.
- **Decks:** Building a deck in the back creates a perfect spot for barbecues and family gatherings.
- **Landscaping:** Thoughtful landscaping around your home can boost its beauty. Consider planting native flora that requires minimal upkeep.

Designing your dream blue barndominium requires attention to detail and thoughtful planning. By considering these essential features, you‚Äôll create a harmonious blend of rustic charm and modern conveniences, making your home a true reflection of your lifestyle. Remember, each decision you make contributes to the unique character and functionality of your space.

### Conclusion

Living in a blue barndominium combines the charm of rustic life with modern comforts, making it an ideal choice for many homeowners. The benefits of this unique style include ample space, energy efficiency, and a design that can be tailored to suit your needs. By choosing a blue barndominium, you embrace a lifestyle that values both aesthetics and functionality‚Äîa sanctuary that‚Äôs peaceful yet vibrant.

When designing your dream blue barndominium, it's essential to focus on key features that enhance your living experience.

1iftx4m,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1iftx4m/aita_im_so_broken_and_confused_about_ending/,"AITA, I'm so broken and confused about ending things with my partner of 4 years?","Grab a coffee, this is a long one, but I'll try summarize as best i can.

I (39F) and my partner (40M) have been together for 4 years. when we met it was an instant connection, and from day 1 we became a couple. Now, to provide some context, I got divorced 6 years ago it was an extremely abusive marriage last had lasted 13 years, and have 3 sons. i took 2 years to heal and find myself before i considered entering into dating (I actually didn't set up my tinder profile, a friend did while we were sitting through a long surgery, it became really funny going through profiles, some were absolutely hilarious, the pictures, omg, haha). Either way, this is how I met \*Carl (not real name).

Carl is a software developer (he's brilliant, an insanely skilled and talented dev). we had been together for a few months when my circumstances changed drastically, Carl offered to let me move in with him, I was apprehensive and excited at the same time. Thing is he stayed in a different city, not far only 45 mins, but it's a 180 degree difference. I went about repainting (his house was literally empty, he slept, ate, existed in his office, bed in there everything so the house had not been maintained at all. When I moved in I started fixing things, repairing, repainting, etc which he really liked and it felt like a home. the commute to my kids (joint custody) when it was my time with them was heavy, they didn't like it there for obvious reasons, no friends around, different house, totally different vibe of this city.

I won't lie, it was an incredibly difficult adjustment. I uprooted, had no friends around, and my family live in a different part of the country. I had no bearings, the people in this city were not nearly as open-minded and friendly an in this way I felt very isolated. Of the people i did meet, only a small handful were authentic and intellectual and weren't offended by different opinions and views. it was hard, really hard, to top it off, i wasn't working. Carl never showed me around the city, and the people i saw the most were his parents.

So as I was battling to adjust, Carl suddenly had to start travelling for work, but like for 2 months at a time, so i was completely alone (backstory: his boss was an asshole, a true narcissist in every way, not the 'oh he's a narcissist' way, a real one, the red flags were on display, when i brought it up Carl got angry, if i mentioned anything 'negative' about this dude, it was met with serious anger, Carl literally couldn't see that his boss didn't give a f\*\*k about him, but I could). this caused so much tension, even the suggestion of getting his cv out there to feel around was taboo to bring up.

So off he went diligently as instructed. he'd be gone for months, back for a couple months then gone again. his life revolved around his boss. But i loved (and still love!) Carl. i do have to admit it was super hard for me, we fought a lot while he was away, and i realized that when i did cause a fight it was because i was desperate for connection and also what I think was a little jealous that he was having all these experiences and making memories of exciting new places that i could not share with him. I did explain this to him once I had figured it out though. either way, I was committed, I was in this 100%, I love him, i wanted to stand by him. but things got crazier and crazier with his boss, the demands became insane, neon red flags everywhere.

I gave Carl all of me because I knew the person he was, but that changed as his work changed and he started assimilating the toxic attitude of his boss and treating me as though i wasn't a person, but i still tried. i am not going to say i was perfect, no damn way, I am an independent thinker, i have my own view and opinions, there are times where i am definitely at fault, and i will take full responsibility for them.

I eventually found a job again, and it was in my city, the commute was 2 hours there, 2 hours back (traffic) and super expensive. Carl and i agreed we would both move back to my city since he works remotely from anywhere. when we spoke about it i put a timeframe down saying that as soon as my contract becomes permeant the move has to happen, basically in 7 months he agreed. I kept reminding him, but i don't know if he just wasn't paying attention or if he didn't realize it was going to happen.

Things came to a head in August of last year, I came home on a friday and told him i was going to be leaving on sunday back to my city. He broke down, he admitted that he had neglected me and had treated me pretty toxic, begging me not to go. we both cried a lot that weekend because we were both in pain, but it was something i had to do, something he had known about, that i had constantly reminded him about. He took me leaving his house as a sign that I was leaving him, that was not the case! I told him it was not the case, but he still believed it was.

He left again for thailand in October. I was STILL committed to him and i made this clear. In december he was involved in a terrible accident that landed him in ICU for 3 days, and another 9 days in general ward. After this happened ALL i wanted to do was get to him but i couldn't. But we connected during this time more so than we had in the last year, we were communicating healthily expressing our feelings, growing and repairing us, i felt like the guy I had met was finally back, the man I knew was back, it was magical. but very short lived. it was also at this time that his boss revealed his true psycho colours that i had already known he was for years.

Carl was suddenly thrust into chaos, he didn't know what to do, but at the same time he stopped communicating with me. I had no idea what was happening, constantly asking if he was safe and what was going on. Now if there's one thing i know far too well, it's chaos and having your world fliped on it's head. I could absolutely 100% identify with the confusion, the overwhelm and the fear for your life and safety. This is territory i know intimately.

Over the course of January, i was constantly trying to communicate with him, constantly asking what's happening, how he was, what his plan was, asking from any kind of clarity, that i love him and support him. I was telling him to come home, regroup, and go from there. His answers changed from day to day if i even heard from him at all. it got to the point mid-January that i had no idea if we were even together anymore.

The whole of January was hell, I knew nothing, was told different things constantly. I was worried, anxious and so fearful for him, I hated what he was going through because i knew exactly what it feels like. At the same time i was grateful that he had finally seen his boss for who he really is, and even though i knew this would eventually be the case i hated that Carl was in pain.

He told me he was coming home, but that all changed. instead what started happening was him telling me that he actually didn't want to come home, he said his heart was no longer here, that we had been apart for too long, I asked him if he was breaking up with me, he said no. but this didn't align with what he was saying in his messages. I sent him vids every morning and evening telling him i love him, i support him, i will wait for him, but nothing apart from ""thank you"". For the last 12 days I have literally, and i mean literally been begging him to tell me if he sees me in his future or not. his response was that it was more complicated than that, what does that even mean? when you ask someone whether they see you in their life and future it's a simple yes or no. Yesterday I couldn't deal with it anymore, I have cried so much for weeks, I have lived with not knowing what's going on at all. i sent him a text saying it was a simple question to answer, and his silence and things he has said in messages is actually the answer and I'm listening now, after i sent that I blocked him.

my heart is shattered, I was fighting so hard constantly telling him i love him, i support him, i will wait for him, i will fight with him, that i will stand by him through the darkest times, but it's like it didn't matter to him at all. Now i'm sitting here wondering how in one month our relationship went from magic to nothing. I'm wondering if he even cares that it's ended, if he loved me like he claimed, if i even mattered to him?

I kind of wish he could post his side of things and his feelings so i could at least get some understanding of what has happened.

I'm sorry this is so long (even super summarized it's damn long) but AITA for not fighting harder, should i have just given him more time? ",1,1738489666.0,okstorytime,0,1.0,False

Most, if not all, in our department disliked her because she has the reputation of being malandi. She slept with a few men in our department, though may bf din sya na LDR, kuno. May mga nasira na ding relationships because of her.

Now, my problem is‚Ä¶ she just passed the exam (I am happy for her) but is applying at my boyfriend‚Äôs firm! Of all the places na pwede nya sanang pag-applyan.

My bf already talked to his boss about ‚Äúour‚Äù past and understood the awkwardness and worries we both would feel about it, but parang hindi na sya makakabawi sa pagtanggap sa kanya kasi malakas din ang mga backer ni girl.

I am about to take my exam too (like theirs). Matagal ko ng pangarap to. But my peace is nowhere to be found. My bf wanted to resign, but he‚Äôs concerned about his clients kasi doon ang opisina nya. Mahihirapan ang mga kliyente nya kung sakaling aalis sya doon.

Naguguluhan ako sobra. I don‚Äôt want him to resign kasi mahihirapan din sya, at the same time, iniisip ko palang na nasa iisang opisina sila and knowing how pushy this girl is (may bf sya ngayon, LDR parin) parang mababaliw ako.

Meanwhile LEMB somehow managed to write off ¬£375,000 on ‚Äúcelebration gifts‚Äù for residents and spent ¬£46,000 on a foreign trip for board members. This is money being paid in through service charges from residents.

1iftpzf,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iftpzf/the_smiling_monsters_are_watching_you/,The Smiling Monsters Are Watching You.,"The first time I saw one of them, I thought it was a trick of the light.¬†¬†

It was late‚Äîpast midnight‚Äîand I‚Äôd been working on my laptop for hours, the only light in the room coming from the blue glow of the screen. I was about to close it when I glanced toward the window and saw it.¬†¬†

A figure.¬†¬†

It was standing on the sidewalk outside my apartment, just beyond the edge of the streetlight. Its body was shadowy and indistinct, but its face‚Ä¶¬†¬†

Its face was smiling.¬†¬†

Not a friendly smile. Not the kind you‚Äôd give a stranger in passing. This smile was wrong‚Äîtoo wide, too sharp, like its mouth had been stretched beyond its limits.¬†¬†

I stared at it, my heart pounding. For a moment, I thought it might be a person. A prank, maybe. But the longer I looked, the more I realized there was something unnatural about the way it stood, the way it stared at me without blinking.¬†¬†

I closed the laptop and pulled the curtains shut, telling myself it was just my imagination.¬†¬†

But the image of that smile stayed with me.¬†¬†
The next day, I convinced myself it had been a dream.¬†¬†

I told no one. What was there to say? That I‚Äôd seen a shadowy figure with a creepy smile standing outside my window? People would laugh, or worse, think I was losing it.¬†¬†

I went about my day, trying to forget, but I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was being watched. At the grocery store, I kept glancing over my shoulder. On the bus ride home, I felt a pair of unseen eyes boring into the back of my head.¬†¬†

That night, as I sat in my living room watching TV, I heard it‚Äîa soft, rhythmic tapping against the window.¬†¬†

I froze.¬†¬†

The curtains were drawn, but I could see the faint outline of something standing on the other side of the glass.¬†¬†

Slowly, I stood and approached the window, my breath shallow. I reached for the edge of the curtain and pulled it back just enough to peek outside.¬†¬†

It was there.¬†¬†

The same figure from the night before, its face pressed against the glass, its grin impossibly wide.¬†¬†

I stumbled back, my heart hammering in my chest. When I looked again, it was gone.¬†¬† 

Over the next few days, the figures started appearing everywhere.¬†¬†

At first, it was just one or two, standing at the edge of my vision‚Äîon the sidewalk across the street, in the corner of a crowded caf√©, reflected in the glass of a shop window.¬†¬†

But soon, they began to multiply.¬†¬†

They stood in groups now, always watching, their grins frozen in place. They never moved, never spoke, but their presence was suffocating.¬†¬†

I couldn‚Äôt escape them.¬†¬†

They were outside my apartment when I left for work, standing silently in the alley as I hurried past. I saw them on the subway, their smiling faces visible through the windows as the train pulled into the station.¬†¬†

Even at work, they found me. I‚Äôd glance up from my desk and see one of them standing in the parking lot, its head tilted as though it were studying me.¬†¬†

I tried to tell myself it wasn‚Äôt real. That I was hallucinating. But no matter how hard I tried to ignore them, they wouldn‚Äôt go away. 

The first dream came on the fifth night.¬†¬†

I was standing in an empty field, the sky a deep, unnatural red. The air was thick and heavy, like I was breathing through a wet cloth.¬†¬†

The figures surrounded me, their smiles glowing in the dim light.¬†¬†

They didn‚Äôt move or speak, but I could feel their eyes on me, their gaze like a physical weight pressing down on my chest.¬†¬†

One of them stepped forward, its grin widening until it split its face in two. Its mouth opened, revealing row upon row of jagged teeth.¬†¬†

It didn‚Äôt say anything. It didn‚Äôt need to.¬†¬†

I woke up gasping for air, my sheets soaked with sweat.¬†¬†

But the worst part wasn‚Äôt the dream.¬†¬†

The worst part was the figure standing at the foot of my bed, its smile gleaming in the darkness.¬†¬†

I stopped leaving my apartment after that.¬†¬†

The figures were everywhere now‚Äîoutside my window, in the hallway, reflected in every mirror and screen. Even when I closed my eyes, I could feel their smiles, burned into the back of my mind.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt sleep. I barely ate. Every time I tried to call for help, the line would go dead, the faint sound of distant laughter crackling through the receiver.¬†¬†

I tried confronting them once. I stood at the window and screamed at the figure standing on the sidewalk. ‚ÄúWhat do you want from me?‚Äù¬†¬†

It didn‚Äôt respond. It just tilted its head, its grin stretching impossibly wide.¬†¬†

And then it took a step closer.¬†¬†¬†¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until the twelfth day that I understood why they were watching me.¬†¬†

I was staring at my reflection in the bathroom mirror, trying to convince myself I wasn‚Äôt losing my mind, when I noticed something.¬†¬†

My smile.¬†¬†

It was... wrong.¬†¬†

Too wide. Too sharp.¬†¬†

The realization hit me like a punch to the gut: I was becoming one of them.¬†¬†

The whispers in the back of my mind, the growing hunger, the way my face felt stretched and unnatural‚Äîit all made sense now.¬†¬†

They weren‚Äôt watching me.¬†¬†

They were waiting for me.¬†¬†¬†¬†

I fought it at first, clinging to what little humanity I had left.¬†¬†

But the change was inevitable.¬†¬†

My reflection no longer matched my memories. My eyes were too bright, my grin permanently etched into my face. Even my voice had changed, taking on a hollow, echoing quality that didn‚Äôt feel like my own.¬†¬†
The figures didn‚Äôt stand outside anymore. They were inside my apartment, surrounding me, their smiles no longer menacing but welcoming.¬†¬†

I could hear their whispers now, soft and inviting: ‚ÄúJoin us. You‚Äôve always been one of us.‚Äù

And deep down, I knew they were right.¬†¬†

The final step came when I stopped resisting.¬†¬†

The fear melted away, replaced by a strange, euphoric calm. My smile widened, my body dissolving into shadow, until I stood among them, my grin as wide and sharp as theirs.¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt know how much time had passed. Days? Weeks? Time had become meaningless.¬†¬†

I stopped recognizing myself‚Äînot just in the mirror, but in my thoughts, my actions. The smiling monsters didn‚Äôt need to force me to join them. My resistance was crumbling all on its own.¬†¬†

I began to feel... connected to them.¬†¬†

It started as a faint hum in the back of my mind, like static. Over time, it grew louder, clearer, until I could almost understand it‚Äîa language made of whispers and emotions, of hunger and patience.¬†¬†

When I looked at the figures surrounding me, I didn‚Äôt feel fear anymore. I felt kinship.¬†¬†

And that terrified me.¬†¬†

I decided to run.¬†¬†

It wasn‚Äôt rational‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt even know where I could go. But sitting in that apartment, surrounded by their grins, waiting for the inevitable, was worse than death.¬†¬†

So, I packed a bag and left in the middle of the night.¬†¬†

They didn‚Äôt stop me.¬†¬†

In fact, they didn‚Äôt react at all. As I stepped out into the cold, empty street, they simply watched, their smiles frozen, their heads tilting ever so slightly as if to say, Go ahead. See if it matters.¬†¬†

I walked for hours, my feet aching, my breath clouding in the freezing air. I didn‚Äôt know where I was going, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt stop. Not until I was far, far away from them.¬†¬†

But no matter how far I went, they were always there.¬†¬†

I reached a small town just as the sun began to rise. It was quiet, the streets empty, the houses dark.¬†¬†

For a moment, I thought I was safe.¬†¬†

But then I saw them.¬†¬†

They were everywhere‚Äîstanding in windows, sitting on porches, lurking in alleyways. Every single face was frozen in that same wide, impossible grin.¬†¬†

This wasn‚Äôt just about me anymore.¬†¬†

The smiling monsters weren‚Äôt following me. They were spreading.¬†¬†

I stumbled into a diner on the edge of town, my heart pounding. The place looked abandoned‚Äîdusty tables, flickering lights‚Äîbut I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to care.¬†¬†

I collapsed into a booth, burying my face in my hands. My mind raced with questions, with fears, with the growing certainty that I‚Äôd never escape.¬†¬†

‚ÄúRough night?‚Äù¬†¬†

The voice startled me.¬†¬†

I looked up to see a man standing behind the counter, a worn apron tied around his waist. He didn‚Äôt have the smile. His face was tired, his eyes bloodshot.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not... like them,‚Äù I said, my voice trembling.¬†¬†

He laughed bitterly. ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù¬†¬†

The man‚Äôs name was Allen. He poured us both a cup of coffee and sat across from me, his hands trembling as he lit a cigarette.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been here for weeks,‚Äù he said, staring into the swirling smoke. ‚ÄúAt first, it was just a few. Standing in the shadows, watching. Then more came. And more.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWhat do they want?‚Äù¬†¬†

Allen looked at me, his eyes filled with a mix of fear and resignation. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt want anything. They‚Äôre just... waiting.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúFor you.‚Äù¬†¬†

Allen told me something I didn‚Äôt want to believe.¬†¬†

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not just following you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre part of you. Don‚Äôt you feel it? That connection? That pull?‚Äù¬†¬†

I shook my head, denying it even as I felt the hum in my mind growing louder.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou brought them here,‚Äù Allen continued. ‚ÄúWherever you go, they‚Äôll follow. And when they‚Äôve consumed everything... they‚Äôll take you, too.‚Äù¬†¬†

His words hit me like a punch to the gut.¬†¬†

I‚Äôd thought I was running from them, escaping their gaze. But the truth was worse.¬†¬†

I was their anchor.¬†¬† 

I wanted to leave, but Allen stopped me.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf you run, it‚Äôll only get worse,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt outrun them. You have to face them.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù I asked, desperation creeping into my voice.¬†¬†

Allen didn‚Äôt answer. Instead, he handed me a small, rusted key. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a room in the back. You‚Äôll know what to do.‚Äù¬†¬†

I didn‚Äôt understand, but I took the key anyway.¬†¬†

The room was empty except for a single mirror hanging on the far wall.¬†¬†

When I looked into it, I didn‚Äôt see myself.¬†¬†

I saw them.¬†¬†

The figures stared back at me from the mirror, their grins wide and gleaming. But there was something different now.¬†¬†

They weren‚Äôt just watching me.¬†¬†

They were me.¬†¬†

Each figure in the mirror was a twisted reflection of myself‚Äîmy face, my body, my smile. I realized then that the monsters hadn‚Äôt been following me.¬†¬†

They‚Äôd been growing inside me.¬†¬†

The connection wasn‚Äôt a curse. It was a transformation.¬†¬†

And I was almost complete.¬†¬†

Allen‚Äôs voice echoed in my mind: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll know what to do.‚Äù

The mirror shimmered, the figures shifting and writhing as they reached for me, their smiles widening.¬†¬†

I could feel the pull, the hunger, the promise of peace if I just let go. If I let myself become one of them.¬†¬†

But then I thought about the town, about Allen, about the people who would suffer if I gave in.¬†¬†

I gathered the courage, raised my fist, and smashed the mirror.

The mirror shattered into a thousand pieces, each shard reflecting a distorted version of my face. The humming in my mind stopped, replaced by a deafening silence.¬†¬†

When I stumbled out of the room, the diner was empty. The figures outside were gone, their smiles erased from the streets.¬†¬†

For the first time in weeks, I felt alone.¬†¬†

But I wasn‚Äôt free.¬†¬†

The connection was still there, a faint hum at the edge of my thoughts. The smiling monsters were gone, but I could feel them waiting, watching, just out of sight.¬†¬†

And I knew they weren‚Äôt finished with me.¬†¬†

Not yet.¬†¬†

I thought it was over.¬†¬†

For days, the streets were empty. The shadows were just shadows again, and the oppressive feeling of being watched had lifted. I even started to believe that breaking the mirror had saved me.¬†¬†

But tonight, I woke up to the sound of tapping.¬†¬†

It was soft at first, almost rhythmic, coming from the window beside my bed. I froze, my breath catching in my throat. I didn‚Äôt want to look, but the tapping grew louder, more insistent, until I couldn‚Äôt ignore it.¬†¬†

Slowly, I turned my head.¬†¬†

There, pressed against the glass, was a face. My face.¬†¬†

The grin stretched impossibly wide, the eyes glowing faintly in the darkness. Its mouth moved, forming words I couldn‚Äôt hear.¬†¬†

I scrambled out of bed, my heart racing, but when I turned around, another figure was standing in the corner of the room.¬†¬†

It was me again, its smile frozen, its head tilting slightly as it stepped forward.¬†¬†

The hum in my mind returned, louder than ever, drowning out my thoughts.¬†¬†

I backed into the wall, my chest tightening as more figures emerged from the shadows‚Äîeach one a perfect copy of me, their grins splitting their faces in half.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy are you doing this?‚Äù I screamed.¬†¬†

The figures didn‚Äôt answer.¬†¬†

They didn‚Äôt need to.¬†¬†

Because in the corner of my eye, I caught my reflection in the cracked mirror above the dresser.¬†¬†

I was smiling.¬†¬†",2,1738488767.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1iftnrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1iftnrm/i_dont_know_what_else_to_do_about_my/,I don't know what else to do about my situationship with a friend.,"Hello, peeps.

First of all, I need to be clear about my orientation: I'm in the aroace spectrum, been known since a few months ago and I am in good terms about it. In fact, I'm proud of finally coming out as aroace after pondering about my orientation for a while (I thought I was bi, then demi).  
  
Also, I'm autistic. I'm always in my own world and let very few people in and am very apathetic and indifferent about pretty much everything, and struggle a lot with emotions and what not.  
  
Thing is, I like someone. And they like me back. Hell, we even made out a couple times. And we've been struggling back and forth every time because they feel too much while I feel too little and although we agree on comunicate every little thing so we can come up with something we're both comfortable, we end up arguing because, again, our way to feel things are really different. They're romantic, I'm not. They like physical contact, I don't (not that I hate it, but I need A LOT of confidence to do it). They like talking, I don't. They like going out and make plans, I don't. They like showing emotions, I don't ‚Äî and I can't. Basically, we're on different pages.  
  
This happened twice and we stopped talking for a while but recently, we went back to it again and we agreed on taking things slowly, especially because I just came out of a friendship of +10 years where my best friend tried to manipulate me and‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ This is a story for another time, maybe. But I have not been the same ever since. I've always been very introverted and very protective about my things, I barely have friends, I don't trust anybody and don't open up to anybody, except maybe my therapist and she needs A LOT of work to make me talk, oops. But since then, all of those things have become worse, in a way. And although we agreed on a slow pace, I still feel like they go in a very different speed than I do.  
  
Every time I try to speak up and convey about what I feel, I feel like I f\*ck up every time because I'm brutally honest and sometimes don't have filter. I'm very blunt and apathetic about pretty much everything and my medication (my happy pills) don't let me feel‚Ä¶ sorry, maybe? For other people. And people apparently don't like that. Maybe there's something wrong with me, I don't know.  
  
Anyway, we made out the other day. And then we argued the next day. Third time it happens. It frustrates me because I know I'm hurting them with my way to be about everything, but I cannot be someone I'm not. When they push a little further, I hide in my shell like a scared turtle because I'm not a very open person. I don't like pretending either. I feel like an a\*\*hole most of the time, but I cannot change my entire personality. I want to be their good friend first before something else comes up, because they're a dear friend to me. I want something to happen ‚Äî if it happens in the end ‚Äî to be natural. No expectations. Just go with the flow. I still need to do a lot of work on myself after what I've been through and it may take months, years, whatever. I'm in the aroace spectrum, but I believe I can be good for a special someone someday. Maybe we're not meant to be that close, despite wanting it.  
  
I feel I'm letting some things out, but I just woke up and I'm drinking my morning coffee and needed to vent after arguing last night.

_A very quick bit of background._  On my desktop, I'm trying to be a bit clever: I don't want the machine to suspend when I go for a coffee, because I probably am doing something like compiling or waiting for something to finish.  But I do want it to lock and, eventually, put the screens in power saving mode.

So I run swayidle [thus](https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/dotfiles/blob/jeff-sway-idle-fiddling/sway/sway/bin/sway-desktop-idle-active):

```
exec swayidle \\
    timeout 300 'swaylock -c 000000; $HOME/bin/sway-desktop-dpms-on' \
    timeout 600 ""$HOME/bin/sway-desktop-dpms-off""  \
    after-resume ""$HOME/bin/sway-desktop-dpms-on""  \
    before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
```

Note that I don't expect `after-resume` ever to trigger here, since I'm not suspending.  Maybe some day I should trim it.

That `sway-dekstop-dpms-on` script, in turn, is just [this](https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/dotfiles/blob/jeff-sway-idle-fiddling/sway/sway/bin/sway-desktop-dpms-on):
```
swaymsg ""output * dpms on""

```
The full set of scripts is [here](https://github.com/JeffAbrahamson/dotfiles/blob/jeff-sway-idle-fiddling/sway/sway/bin/sway-desktop-dpms-on), fwiw.  The main point of pushing this to scripts was to give me logging so I could have a hope of debugging it.

02/02/25 - 4:11 AM



A pain disquiets me as I pass through the caverns once more.  That feeling of being watched is much stronger today.  There are no visitors this time of year and I can feel like being alone ... despite this feeling.  (Is it myself wanting to be watched, that feeling of authority above me?)  The outside has an inviting warmth, as opposed to the caves' deep chill.  I look once more towards the sunny disposition of Spring and breath a sigh.  It is time to go in.  And be alone.



Deep inside of the caves, smooth floor from humanity's boring feels disconnected to the √¶ons old rock walls.  I feel like an invader inside of Gaia's flesh.  But I am not here to hurt Her.  I just need contemplation.  Somewhere further down, past where the lights still flicker, I find the mining overseers office.  It's unlocked.  Two packages of cigarettes lay upon the desk that sits in the far corner of the room, and a chair that looks like it hasn't been upgraded since the 1950s sits pathetically.  I sit down and think.



My life up until this point has been a cascading series of failures.  I proposed to my childhood sweetheart to only find out that she has never been interested in me in the first place.  My father told me that he expected great things from me, not the disappointment that his *son* has shown.  Diminutive.  Diminutive.  Diminutive.  My mother at least was proud of the fact that I came so far, despite the loathsome crushing of everyone else.  



I reach for a cigarette.  I hesitate however and remember that I have been ten years sober since the last time I let nicotine rob my lungs.  I push the cigarette back into the packaging and breathe out a sigh.  A smile creeps my face, and I start laughing.  And as I do so, the tears that I've been holding back for so long finally burst free.  



I exit the mines at a quarter past five, and head to the local diner down from the caverns.  Miss Suzy greets me with a warm smile, and a friendly complexion as she does for all the mine workers.  She asks me how's life been, and I tell her, it is as good as can be expected for somebody with so much sorrow.  And she pats me on the back, and pours a fresh pot of coffee for me, before remembering that I don't like coffee, and gets out the chocolate milk.  Sorry about that, she said.  And no worries, was said back from me.  I paid for the coffee anyways and told her that she can have mine.  She thanked me, and told me that I am too kind.  A casual conversation followed, and after a spell, I headed out and towards home.  



Sometimes, it is these moments of humanity that makes me realize that I like living.  ",1,1738488141.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

It took nearly a minute to get anything like the normal quantity of espresso, the coffee beginning to come through after about 20s. I did another flush this time with a cleaning tab, cleaned the screen and gasket, and have pulled a couple more shots, both taking around 50s to get 38g-40g out (from 20g in), though at least the flow started at around 8s.

How to Create Engaging Pins That Drive Traffic to Your Amazon Affiliate Links
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to drive traffic to your Amazon affiliate links, creating engaging pins on Pinterest is one of the best strategies. Pinterest users are in a browsing mindset, looking for ideas and inspiration. If you know how to capture their interest, you can increase the visibility of your affiliate products significantly. Here are some effective ways to create pins that stand out and attract clicks.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-share-amazon-affiliate-links-on-pinterest  
  
### Understanding Your Audience

Before you start making pins, take a moment to understand who your audience is. Think about their interests, needs, and pain points. Here are a few questions to guide you:

- What problems are they trying to solve?
- What are their preferences when it comes to design, color, and style?
- Which Amazon products would they find beneficial?

By answering these questions, you can tailor your pins to appeal directly to the people you want to reach.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-share-amazon-affiliate-links-on-pinterest  
  
### Designing Eye-Catching Pins

The first thing users notice is your pin's design. To make it enticing, follow these guidelines:

- **Use High-Quality Images:** Clear, high-resolution images are essential. Avoid blurry or low-quality photos.
- **Create Vertical Pins:** Pinterest favors vertically-oriented pins, typically with a 2:3 aspect ratio. This layout takes up more space and is easier to engage with.
- **Incorporate Text Overlays:** Bold, concise text can explain the benefit of your pin. Aim for a font that is legible and catches the eye.
- **Use Brand Colors:** Consistency is key. Utilize your brand colors to create recognition among your audience.

### Crafting Compelling Descriptions

The description accompanying your pin can greatly influence its performance. When writing descriptions:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-share-amazon-affiliate-links-on-pinterest  
  
- Incorporate relevant keywords naturally to improve searchability.
- Engage viewers with a call to action, such as ""Click to find out more!"" or ""Learn how this product can help you!""
- Highlight benefits and unique selling points of the products you promote.

Using effective descriptions will not only help users understand your pin but also encourage them to click through to your links.

### Utilizing Rich Pins

Rich pins automatically sync information from your website to your pins. This feature can enhance your pins' functionality by providing extra context. They come in different types, like product rich pins that showcase pricing and availability for affiliate products. To set up rich pins:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-share-amazon-affiliate-links-on-pinterest  
  
1. Use Pinterest's Rich Pins Validator to check if your website qualifies.
2. Implement the required meta tags on your website.
3. Apply for rich pins directly on Pinterest.

Using rich pins not only makes your pins more dynamic, but it also increases trust among potential buyers.

### Pinning Strategy

Simply creating beautiful pins is not enough; you need to have a strategy for pinning them as well. Here are some tips:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/how-to-share-amazon-affiliate-links-on-pinterest  
  
- **Pin Regularly:** Aim to pin consistently, whether daily or weekly. This keeps your presence active.
- **Join Group Boards:** Collaborate with other pinners by joining group boards in your niche. This can extend the reach of your pins.
- **Engage with Your Audience:** Reply to comments and engage with others. Building a community can help increase your visibility.

### Analyzing Performance

Keep track of the performance of your pins. Pinterest Analytics provides valuable insights into what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Monitor:

- Which pins receive the most saves and clicks.
- Your audience demographics and preferences.
- Trends over time to understand the seasonality of your products.

This data will guide you in creating even more relevant and engaging content.

1iftb4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/foodsensitivities/comments/1iftb4o/my_brewers_and_bakers_yeast_sensitivity_ended_up/,My brewer‚Äôs and baker‚Äôs yeast sensitivity ended up being a sign of mold issues in our house,"Hey guys, I don‚Äôt know if any of you have done a sensitivity test, but I‚Äôve had several now so I can speak freely about their positives and limitations. 

My first sensitivity test was done in the USA, and boy did it light up like a Christmas tree. I had taken it blindly, on a vague recommendation that it can help decrease some of the inflammation in the body, and as someone struggling with PCOS, I wanted to find ways to do just that.

At the time, I was horrified. What do you mean I couldn‚Äôt have gluten, or eggs, or milk? And no potatoes, coffee? Aubergines? Tomatoes??? What the heck!

Anyway, my digestion was OK at the time. Not great, not awful. Just ok. I would be mad to cut out all that lovely food. 

Well, fast forward to my moving to Ireland, living in a moldy house for several years, and needing to take antibiotics for several weeks.

Everything went to chaos. For ages I couldn‚Äôt digest just about anything. That was when I realised a food sensitivity test might not be such a bad thing. 

This time the results were similar, but on top of the usual suspects, I saw that both brewer‚Äôs yeast and baker‚Äôs yeast were in the red, and mushrooms! 

I called the company through which I did the test, and they very seriously recommended checking my house for mold. It was weird, but something about their insistence stuck with me.

We did, and it turned out one of the walls in our kitchen was completely damp due to a leak. The mold inspector found spores and mold infestations everywhere. Great‚Ä¶ and I tested positive for a crazy level of some mold toxin. 

Not long after that, I had moved to a different country with a much drier environment. The yeast and mushroom sensitivities were gone within a year. ",1,1738486921.0,foodsensitivities,0,1.0,False

Hello and thank you.

My girlfriend and I have a relationship of ups and downs since April. We met in the city we lived and then she went away (5hr train) for work. So we became sorta long distance.

That was fine, because I wanted to make it work. I was unemployed at the time so I had more possibilities and occasions to visit her than viceversa. I spent a lot of time travelling from the two cities, often in the very first morning. I always participated in the expenses and never lived as a leech in her new house. I did this always and only for love, the discomfort was pretty much non existent when I thought of her face, voice and smile.

But there always has been a problem. She never came in my city (and hers) only for me. It was always some occasions where she made some time for me, like sleeping one night then going to family, with friends, etc. I was never not okay with her doing her things, of course. I was not okay, though, with her never coming for me as the first reason, and in a long distance relationship I value that. The commitment I feel must be somewhat reciprocated.

So, fast forward, since some times we didn't had a coffee, a beer, a dinner out, a night out in our original city where we met and I live. She comes down for her sister's birthday and sleeps at my place. The day after she went to family, hangs out with a friend for dinner then sleeps with me. 

Now, for the remaining time our plans where: go out after lunch, have coffee we two, hang out, walk in the city, find a present for her sister. I was excited! How much I longed for something like this! 

Then, her friend of the night before calls.
She stand up from the kitchen and goes picking up the phone. I overhear that she tells her that yes, we are totally fine going for a coffee in the center with her and her mother. I was very bitter. So, she hangs the phone with our new plans ready and comes back to eat. I then tell her I didn't quite like to be left out of plans that involves me and other people when we had our day planned, our day in the city since...months?

She lashes out. She starts raising her voice, accusing me of being antisocial, controlling and a man that wants her secluded and isolated from her friends. She even made comments, almost screaming, about how her exes were involved with her friends and family (her exes she described like abusives), while I don't want it. I felt gutted and hurt and like crying. I try to calm the tones and to talk, to resolve this like a couple, not with throwing plates. She bolted out the door to go without me at the coffee, saying that she didn't want to see even my shadow. I am devasted.

The evening at the party she kisses me in the lips in front of everyone and everything seems like a dream. I can't believe she can switch this way. I feel almost revolted not by her but by me that stand those situations. She doesn't seem to want to apologize and I tried to talk about it the next day, because I am hurt, but she seems okay with what she did and somehow I was the one at fault for even thinking that she should have like asked me if I was okay with the imminent change of plans (I would have been totally ok, it was a damn coffee, BUT ASK ME!)

How do I move? I am devastated.

Anyway, she comes from an abusive household for her mother's abusive and manipulative behaviors.

TL.DR: My girlfriend lashed out after I told her she could be making plans that involves me and other people asking me before, when we had already planned to be together me and her  alone after months.",1,1738486871.0,relationships,2,1.0,False

1ift8xh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1ift8xh/the_impact_of_daily_gratitude_journaling_on_your/,The impact of daily gratitude journaling on your mindset,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! üåü Ever thought about how a simple shift in mindset can revolutionize your day-to-day life? Today, we're diving deep into the power of **daily gratitude journaling**, and trust me, it‚Äôs a game-changer. üí™ Let's get into it!

First off, why gratitude? ü§î It's simple. Gratitude reprograms our brain to spot the positive rather than dwell on the negative. It's like wearing those rose-tinted glasses your grandma always talked about, but instead of smudging up the lenses, you're clearing away the mental fog. üï∂Ô∏è

üî• **The Science Behind It**: According to a myriad of studies (yes, there‚Äôs actual science involved, folks!), consistently engaging in gratitude practices can improve mental health, enhance relationships, and even lead to better sleep. üí§ Think about it: who doesn't want to fall asleep with a smile rather than a frown?

‚ú® **How to Start Your Gratitude Journey**:
1. **Keep it simple**: Every morning or night, jot down three things you‚Äôre grateful for. Make them specific! Instead of ""I‚Äôm grateful for my family,"" try ""I‚Äôm grateful for that hilarious inside joke with my sister."" ü§≠
   
2. **Mix it Up**: Don't just stick to the big stuff. Be grateful for your morning coffee, that perfect song on the radio, or even the stranger who held the door open for you. ‚òïüö™

3. **Consistency is Key**: The real magic happens with repetition. This is a lifestyle shift, not a one-time fix. Put it on your calendar or set a daily reminder. üìÖ 

4. **Reflect and Evolve**: Occasionally, review past entries. You'll be amazed at how far you've come and how many amazing things you've collected in life. It's like making your personal ""collection of happiness."" üòç

And here‚Äôs the cool part: the more you practice gratitude journaling, the more you'll notice those positive vibes seeping into other areas of your life. Your mindset gradually shifts from scarcity to abundance, helping you to see possibilities where you once saw roadblocks. üöß‚û°Ô∏èüöÄ

But hey, let‚Äôs be real ‚Äì not every day is going to be sunshine and rainbows. üå¶Ô∏è That‚Äôs okay! On tougher days, gratitude practices remind us that even amidst chaos, there's always a flicker of light.

For those who want to dive deeper into changing their mindset and maximizing personal growth, here's a cool resource I stumbled upon [link here](https://whop.com/lifetime-7f/?a=liveitupdeals). Lots of insights and tools to help you along your journey. But, as always, take what resonates and leave what doesn‚Äôt. üí°

In closing, I‚Äôm curious: Has gratitude journaling made a difference for you? Do you have any little gratitude rituals you'd like to share? Drop them in the comments below! Let‚Äôs keep inspiring each other. üåç‚ù§Ô∏è

1ift8ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepOOC/comments/1ift8ux/little_hands/,Little hands,"I always dreamed of becoming a teacher.
The type of teacher who decorate‚Äôs their classroom in hope to brighten everyone‚Äôs day. Expecually during the holiday‚Äôs.
I‚Äôd go all out, not caring about the cost or how long it took to finish. Seeing their little faces light up as they walk in. I‚Äôd be worth it.
I wanted, no‚Ä¶  I needed to become my students favorite teacher. 
A teacher that they will never forget. Whenever my name would be brought up, a memory of me would crawl out of a hidden corner of their mind, and brighten your day. 
That my the dream.
But life has a way of forcing you into places you don‚Äôt belong. After college it was damn near impossible finding a elementary school position.
Ether school funding was being cut, lack of students in the community. Or worst of all the lack of teachers refusing to retire. 
Refusing to pass the torch to that new generation. These old incompetent, waste of human space refusing retirement, makes my blood boil. They‚Äôd rather keep their cushy positions, causing the children to suffer from their lack nuance and 50 year old lesson plans they reuse decades after decades! These senile wrinkled flesh bags should be thrown out! 
Sorry I get a bit huffy over things I have a passion of.
 But I shouldn‚Äôt get upset because I, Victoria Fe Hancock has some amazing news! 
I was finally offered a teaching position! 
Know that I have a chance to make my dream come true, I will do whatever it takes to achieve it, even if it kills me.



2. 
	‚ÄúHello?‚Ä¶ miss Hancock.. anyone there?‚Äù A young man questioning the dead air of the phone call, only hearing deep shallow breathing.
‚ÄúYES! Yes i‚Äôll take it!‚Äù My cell phone shakes in my and slides as I struggle to hold it.
‚ÄúOh.. umm .. perfect. Well like I said.. it‚Äôs a Elementary school called ValleyHaven.. uh in ValleyHaven Pennsylvania.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd don‚Äôt know how‚Äôs many times you need me to agree with you Mr. Phone man but I already said yes.‚Äù The sound of my breathe rising.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, yes I understand that.. I‚Äôm just giving you the information you need.‚Äù
I hold in my breathe and excitement.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶. Ple ‚Ä¶ please go on..‚Äù Phone shakes as palm sweet makes it even harder to hold up th phone.
I quietly holding down my shaky knees as I pay close attention to the recruiter. 
 ‚ÄúMs. Hancock are you still there?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶yes..‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I have one more request from the schools principal.‚Äù I sit up and continue to listen .
‚ÄúIs it possible to be there Monday morning?‚Äù
‚Äú.yes.‚Äù
 ‚Äú.. uh 1hr early to meet the principal before class? I understand you live 4 states away and this is last min‚Ä¶‚Äù I cut him off.
 ‚Äú Mr. Recruiter.. you need not to worry, daddy always said. On the path to your salvation, do what must be done‚Ä¶ I will be there.. besides I‚Äôm currently living in my car so packing is literally already done!‚Äù I said my thank and hung up on him. 
That Friday night I drove 13.25hrs to ValleyHaven.
Not sleeping a wink! Just gas, potty, and coffee. Just what daddy taught me.
I arrived there at 7:45am..
From what seemed to be hours surrounded by trees and dirt paths. Twisting and curving. It finally showed its self. ValleyHaven, It was everything I could‚Äôve dreamed it to be. The smell of cedar and sulfur filling the air, I as in heaven.
I had pulled out all my money found the local motel in and rented my room for the month. That‚Äôs all I could afford. Daddy says I could always make a lil extra cash the next town over, plus I remember seeing a plasma center also.
I spent the weekend days getting my lesson plans ready and exploring the town. Daddy told me not to wonder off too far but, he was just being a over bearing bear.
It‚Äôs Sunday afternoon now, 
Ugh I love this town. It‚Äôs the kind of place where everyone smiles at you, walking into stores you will always hear a 
‚ÄúHello friend!‚Äù 
You literally can‚Äôt go down the street without someone stopping to say hi or a 
‚ÄúHow are you friend.‚Äù I‚Äôve talked to almost everyone I ran into. And the best part, they actually listened to me! Of course I listen to them also. I‚Äôve never had siblings or friends, kids mostly ignored me. It didn‚Äôt change the older I got, I was lonely. The only friend I had was, Daddy. 
The next morning I was in a rush! If it wasn‚Äôt for Daddy waking me up I might have overslept! 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I can ever count on‚Äù I give daddy a tight squeeze.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but today I can‚Äôt bring you, It‚Äôs my..‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course I know if it wasn‚Äôt for you I wouldn‚Äôt be he‚Ä¶ Ok.. Ok what the heck.‚Äù I kiss his little black rough nose and shove him inside my backpack. After taking a Quick Look back making sure everything is put away‚Ä¶ I head out the door.


3.
	The school was hidden away outside of town, one exit one entrance. With the amount of trees it forced me to turn on my head lights. Finally following a light out of the forest. I saw it. The school was a Dark Cathedral style building, a bell was the size of me placed hangin into the building. With some sections taller than others, with the height point in the middle of the building. The building had carvings in every corner, finally noticing it. Stoned children carved into the building. Depicting the children playing hide n seek, but the closer I look. They weren‚Äôt hiding they were chasing.. who are they chasing?  A bronze statue of a  cross with a stoned naked woman hugging it form behind caught my eye.
I must‚Äôve still tired because from down here the stone woman seemed to move.
 Heavy wooden doors open breaking my amazement of the school.
A middle aged man with a peppered  beard started walking my way.
  ‚ÄúMrs. Handcock?‚Äù . The closer he got I noticed his outfit,  wearing a white button up shirt an tie with slacks and boots. On the tie I noticed the cross and women symbol sewed on.
‚ÄúCall me Victoria, Vicky for short.‚Äù I reach out shaking his hand with both my hands in excitement. 
‚ÄúWelcome I hope finding this school wasn‚Äôt a problem? My name is Mikeal, I‚Äôm the Principal‚Ä¶ May I show you around.‚Äù I follow him as we make our way through the massive doors.
	As he showed me around, I felt underwhelmed, the outside was a lot more appealing.
 It was just a typical school hallway,
White paint with a shade of yellow dripping from every corner.  The classrooms had the bare minimum decoration, just crosses and more of the stone children, except they were more detailed. The teachers were lifeless husks moving seats and tables.
‚ÄúSo much work‚Äù I muttered, Mr. Principle continued giving a brief history of the school but I didn‚Äôt listen, my mind already knew what I had too do.
A quiet whisper crawled into my ear. As I agreed with him.
‚ÄúYour right Daddy‚Ä¶ we should.‚Äù

1ift555,https://www.reddit.com/r/UrgentCare/comments/1ift555/high_blood_pressure_maybe/,High blood pressure maybe,"For context, I‚Äôm very sensitive to caffeine. On Monday, I had a cup of coffee (very light) on an empty stomach with maybe a small cookie. That night I noticed my heart was racing. When I tried to sleep lying down, I could feel the pulsating feeling in my neck and the strong beats in my chest. This continued for three nights. I was not alarmed at first since I‚Äôve had a similar reaction in the past- I‚Äôll drink coffee, be jittery for hours and have what I call high blood pressure for 2-3 days after caffeine intake. However, it has never lasted as long as this time. It‚Äôs Sunday now, and I‚Äôm still feeling my heart racing, I‚Äôll experience chest tightness from time to time, shortness of breath, and an odd left ear ache that I haven‚Äôt experienced before. 

I don‚Äôt have an established PCP so I‚Äôve been delaying a docto visit, but also because I‚Äôve been hoping that my symptoms would reside. 

Just now (3am/sunday) I woke up to use the restroom and am having trouble falling back to sleep due to my pounding heart. For the last few nights (Wednesday- Friday night) my strong and fast heart beats have been tolerable. However, this time it feels as though my blood pressure could have gone up a bit more.

1ift2bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BendyAndTheInkMachine/comments/1ift2bz/my_experience_with_bendy/,My experience with bendy,"Nobody is going to read this, but anyway, here ya go

I'm autistic, and when to an autism school, so naturally, back in 2017-2019 when indie got it's funny renaissance, there were a few games that everyone wouldn't shut up about because hyperfixation moment, a couple days ago I realized I'd missed one. I'd played cuphead, fnaf, undertale, baldi, and hello neighbor, but bendy hadn't stood out to me until now, so I bought both ink machine and dark revival on steam because of their sale.

My expectations were destroyed the moment I opened the game. I hadn't seen any gameplay at all, and I hadn't expected the animation style to be the phenomenal work of art it was. Chapter one was exactly what I had expected, since it was pretty much all I knew about the game. The ending hallucination cought me way off gaurd though.

Chapter two was great because it had my boi Sammy, who grew on me very, very quickly. Also having an axe was fun and I was glad to have a weapon that I definitely would never lose. Also after finally getting a good look at the ink demon, I became a little disappointed, he looked honestly pretty dumb.

Boris himself appears, who I initially hated, I bullied him endlessly. Alice was pretty cool, at first, but her section of fetch quests was definitely the weakest part of the series. The second I lost Boris I regretted every insult and vowed to save him at any cost.

Funny carousel man was fun, got the axe back, beat him to death, had a good laugh. The projectionist fighting bendy was probably the best part of the game for me because me and my ten year old brother were cheering like it was a wwe match. I then proceeded to have my heart broken by the brute Boris fight. Allison and Tom showing up was a massive trip.

Chapter five started really weak, with a very long cutscene. But it all worked out when I got to 1v1 Sammy and get my axe back for a short time. The pipe puzzle was broken, but I eventually got past it and reached beast bendy. The first phase was incredibly fun, learning his dash pattern was a really cool experience. Second phase was mid, but the final cutscene was pretty good, albeit confusing

Entering dark revival I had to turn the graphics settings all the way down because my potato couldn't run the game. However, after entering the studio I was able to turn them all the way up and was astonished by how good it all looked. The bendy style somehow got even better. The chapter was also really fun, and I immediately fell in love with the mechanics.

Bendy came back, yippee. The chapter also introduced the slicer, who I did trigger, and proceeded to make me almost fall out of my chair like 20 times throughout the game, getting flow was amazing and I loved it, also Porter was a really fun character.

The spider boss sucked because it had no strategy, only coins and coffee. Becoming amok was... A thing that happened, and I definitely didn't get stuck in the sewer. Also the lore drops were pretty cool.

The city was insane, and the keepers were genuinely creepy at first. Also I got to see Sammy again and that made me happy, still no sign of Boris though.

Alice fight was really great, seeing her pull out a gun was a shock, but a welcome one. Seeing the color as I descended into the lab was a surreal experience.

Shipahoy Wilson gets his own section because this fight was hilarious. Mainly because in his second phase he starts throwing it back with immaculate form, which has me and my brother cheering even louder than when the projectionist got killed. We cheered even louder when bendy straight up killed him.

The beast bendy section had really cool lore and buildup, but was really boring during the gameplay, Sammy did show up though so it was worth it.

The ending was weird as heck. I'm really excited for bendy three. Overall I hadn't given this series anywhere near the credit it deserves, dark revival was higher quality than 95% of AAA games in the last decade.",1,1738485826.0,BendyAndTheInkMachine,0,1.0,False

The type of teacher who decorate‚Äôs their classroom in hope to brighten everyone‚Äôs day. Expecually during the holiday‚Äôs.
I‚Äôd go all out, not caring about the cost or how long it took to finish. Seeing their little faces light up as they walk in. I‚Äôd be worth it.
I wanted, no‚Ä¶  I needed to become my students favorite teacher. 
A teacher that they will never forget. Whenever my name would be brought up, a memory of me would crawl out of a hidden corner of their mind, and brighten your day. 
That my the dream.
But life has a way of forcing you into places you don‚Äôt belong. After college it was damn near impossible finding a elementary school position.
Ether school funding was being cut, lack of students in the community. Or worst of all the lack of teachers refusing to retire. 
Refusing to pass the torch to that new generation. These old incompetent, waste of human space refusing retirement, makes my blood boil. They‚Äôd rather keep their cushy positions, causing the children to suffer from their lack nuance and 50 year old lesson plans they reuse decades after decades! These senile wrinkled flesh bags should be thrown out! 
Sorry I get a bit huffy over things I have a passion of.
 But I shouldn‚Äôt get upset because I, Victoria Fe Hancock has some amazing news! 
I was finally offered a teaching position! 
Know that I have a chance to make my dream come true, I will do whatever it takes to achieve it, even if it kills me.

	‚ÄúHello?‚Ä¶ miss Hancock.. anyone there?‚Äù A young man questioning the dead air of the phone call, only hearing deep shallow breathing.
‚ÄúYES! Yes i‚Äôll take it!‚Äù My cell phone shakes in my and slides as I struggle to hold it.
‚ÄúOh.. umm .. perfect. Well like I said.. it‚Äôs a Elementary school called ValleyHaven.. uh in ValleyHaven Pennsylvania.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd don‚Äôt know how‚Äôs many times you need me to agree with you Mr. Phone man but I already said yes.‚Äù The sound of my breathe rising.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, yes I understand that.. I‚Äôm just giving you the information you need.‚Äù
I hold in my breathe and excitement.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶. Ple ‚Ä¶ please go on..‚Äù Phone shakes as palm sweet makes it even harder to hold up th phone.
I quietly holding down my shaky knees as I pay close attention to the recruiter. 
 ‚ÄúMs. Hancock are you still there?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶yes..‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I have one more request from the schools principal.‚Äù I sit up and continue to listen .
‚ÄúIs it possible to be there Monday morning?‚Äù
‚Äú.yes.‚Äù
 ‚Äú.. uh 1hr early to meet the principal before class? I understand you live 4 states away and this is last min‚Ä¶‚Äù I cut him off.
 ‚Äú Mr. Recruiter.. you need not to worry, daddy always said. On the path to your salvation, do what must be done‚Ä¶ I will be there.. besides I‚Äôm currently living in my car so packing is literally already done!‚Äù I said my thank and hung up on him. 
That Friday night I drove 13.25hrs to ValleyHaven.
Not sleeping a wink! Just gas, potty, and coffee. Just what daddy taught me.
I arrived there at 7:45am..
From what seemed to be hours surrounded by trees and dirt paths. Twisting and curving. It finally showed its self. ValleyHaven, It was everything I could‚Äôve dreamed it to be. The smell of cedar and sulfur filling the air, I as in heaven.
I had pulled out all my money found the local motel in and rented my room for the month. That‚Äôs all I could afford. Daddy says I could always make a lil extra cash the next town over, plus I remember seeing a plasma center also.
I spent the weekend days getting my lesson plans ready and exploring the town. Daddy told me not to wonder off too far but, he was just being a over bearing bear.
It‚Äôs Sunday afternoon now, 
Ugh I love this town. It‚Äôs the kind of place where everyone smiles at you, walking into stores you will always hear a 
‚ÄúHello friend!‚Äù 
You literally can‚Äôt go down the street without someone stopping to say hi or a 
‚ÄúHow are you friend.‚Äù I‚Äôve talked to almost everyone I ran into. And the best part, they actually listened to me! Of course I listen to them also. I‚Äôve never had siblings or friends, kids mostly ignored me. It didn‚Äôt change the older I got, I was lonely. The only friend I had was, Daddy. 
The next morning I was in a rush! If it wasn‚Äôt for Daddy waking me up I might have overslept! 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I can ever count on‚Äù I give daddy a tight squeeze.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but today I can‚Äôt bring you, It‚Äôs my..‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course I know if it wasn‚Äôt for you I wouldn‚Äôt be he‚Ä¶ Ok.. Ok what the heck.‚Äù I kiss his little black rough nose and shove him inside my backpack. After taking a Quick Look back making sure everything is put away‚Ä¶ I head out the door.


3.
	The school was hidden away outside of town, one exit one entrance. With the amount of trees it forced me to turn on my head lights. Finally following a light out of the forest. I saw it. The school was a Dark Cathedral style building, a bell was the size of me placed hangin into the building. With some sections taller than others, with the height point in the middle of the building. The building had carvings in every corner, finally noticing it. Stoned children carved into the building. Depicting the children playing hide n seek, but the closer I look. They weren‚Äôt hiding they were chasing.. who are they chasing?  A bronze statue of a  cross with a stoned naked woman hugging it form behind caught my eye.
I must‚Äôve still tired because from down here the stone woman seemed to move.
 Heavy wooden doors open breaking my amazement of the school.
A middle aged man with a peppered  beard started walking my way.
  ‚ÄúMrs. Handcock?‚Äù . The closer he got I noticed his outfit,  wearing a white button up shirt an tie with slacks and boots. On the tie I noticed the cross and women symbol sewed on.
‚ÄúCall me Victoria, Vicky for short.‚Äù I reach out shaking his hand with both my hands in excitement. 
‚ÄúWelcome I hope finding this school wasn‚Äôt a problem? My name is Mikeal, I‚Äôm the Principal‚Ä¶ May I show you around.‚Äù I follow him as we make our way through the massive doors.
	As he showed me around, I felt underwhelmed, the outside was a lot more appealing.
 It was just a typical school hallway,
White paint with a shade of yellow dripping from every corner.  The classrooms had the bare minimum decoration, just crosses and more of the stone children, except they were more detailed. The teachers were lifeless husks moving seats and tables.
‚ÄúSo much work‚Äù I muttered, Mr. Principle continued giving a brief history of the school but I didn‚Äôt listen, my mind already knew what I had too do.
A quiet whisper crawled into my ear. As I agreed with him.
‚ÄúYour right Daddy‚Ä¶ we should.‚Äù

But Amanda addressed her breakup on TikTok after multiple people were commenting about it. Their last biggest fight was because Carson's family got invited to go to dinner with Alix Earle (the creator Amanda is obsessed with) in Las Vegas when Alix was in town maybe 3ish weeks ago. Carson and Amanda were not invited, and Amanda had a complete tantrum over it. She's now saying that Carson and her just ""don't understand each other's love languages"" which directly correlates to he just didn't try hard enough to go to this dinner that only she cared about because she wanted to meet Alix and make content to get more views and followers. In the most inorganic way possible but as her cooking videos show, she always takes the easy way out. She even posted the video of Kendall Jenner handing her a drink (as a Vegas local, please know these events are so easy to get invited to if you're a girl, you literally don't need a following.) and she MILKED it posting it on reels, TikTok, Snapchat and reposting it to her story. Just shows what she would've done had she met Alix. Carson & her unfollowed each other everywhere and Carson was seen at a Make A Wish event talking to a pretty waitress and got her number. Someone also commented that he followed 25+ Vegas girls in the last week. Honestly, good for him. He's 24 and he deserves a year or however long of being single in Vegas living on his own.

The pricing is on the premium side, I paid ‚Çπ520 for a 250g bag, which is pretty much in line with other specialty roasters. But considering the quality and the whole experience, it felt totally worth it.

My family and I have been living here for 11 years and we never had this problem before. I think this started last month and it's been ongoing since then. I need help on how to get rid of these ants.

1ifss8f,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1ifss8f/ive_never_felt_more_trapped_hopeless_lifeless/,"I‚Äôve never felt more trapped. Hopeless. Lifeless. Lost. In my entire life. 2.5 years of this and only getting worse daily. My life is complete limited, like I‚Äôm disabled.","I feel so trapped. So much body pain. Completely fatigued no matter what I do. I've completely lost all my memories, my sense of self, my emotions including anxiety - I don't get little glimpses of myself anymore. That connection has been severed completely.

Everyone around me is living and real. I'm just a complete zombie. I was able to cry in therapy for the first time in months but felt no release or emotions in my body. I'm completely hopeless - every single day is getting harder to go on. I slept all afternoon and had horribly vivid dreams. We've tried so many meds, different therapies, acceptance, journaling, working out - nothing has helped.

I can't travel, which I used to love so much. I can't enjoy the simple things in life. I can't feel love or give love. I can't sense time or seasons. I feel nothing - I am nothing. I can't even feel anxiety anymore. I am so out of reality and my body. I feel there's no way out of all the suffering, I'm trapped. I don't know how to heal my traumas when I can't connect with myself or my life. Every single day is torture. There's no escape - when I'm awake I suffer, when I'm asleep I suffer. It's like I've died and am stuck in purgatory.

This isn't depression. It's complete lack of self and connection, there's a difference. I don't experience reality at all; like I'm in a box with no windows. With depression, you still have a connection to yourself, you still have your memories and can feel. I have no ability to feel. I'm so so tired and exhausted with life, it's unbelievable. I can't live the life I worked so hard for. And panic attacks / trauma took it all from me. Im struggling in every part of my life - mentally, financially, socially, emotionally, spiritually- there's nothing this isn't affecting. I have no sexual or romantic desire, I don't have any interests or passions, I don't look forward to anything, I can't plan anything. Life used to feel so real - the sun, the trees, the air, the ocean. I can't sense any of it anymore, I'm just a shadow - an outline. 

I don't really know what else to do. I started IFS therapy to try to uncover the trauma my mind is blocking.my mind has blocked out everything- everything. I don't know how I'm even alive or functioning.i somehow have run my own company during this, even started it during this - because work is all I have. My creativity is all I have, it's the only part of me I can still access. I lay here with tears running down my face as I write this because I had a beautiful life, despite all the trauma. I kept going, I created a life for myself. 

I can't feel a beautiful summer night. I can't enjoy my morning coffee in the sun. I can't lay in the grass with no cares in the world. I can't book a flight to my favorite city and just go. I can't see my dog playing at the beach and be filled with joy. I can't hug a friend and feel connected to them. I can't remember all the trips, moments, heart to hearts, memories, that made me - me. Those were the most valuable thins in life and now they are gone. It's only gotten worse as I lose more and more of myself. 

There's no point in living like this - in fact it's the most painful thing I've ever experienced, and that's saying a lot given the trauma I've had. I know what happiness is - I found it and was living my best life. September 2022, that was all taken from me. My quality of life is severely poor - how can you live with such fatigue, nightmares, loss of self, loss of everything that made you feel familiar and human. And no clue how to get any of it back. I'm completely trapped in a nightmare and I'm drowning, there's no one who can save me. I don't even think the therapist can, in 2 and a half years, NOTHING has helped - my condition just worsens daily. I remember what life had I used to feel like, I'm so so so so far away from that life and self, I might as well have never existed ",5,1738484587.0,dpdr,23,1.0,False
1ifss4k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ifss4k,MY GRACEFUL GIRLIE BAG,"In my opinion, the Artelier de Lumen Marron Bag is a elegant, elevated, ethereal, and effortlessly feminine design. It's so simple yet so eloquent. I do enjoy a bag that is a happy medium between structured and slouchy. 

Although this bag isn't slouchy to the touch, it has been moulded into a slouchy design. It's stitched to create curves at the top and sides of the bag to give it that soft feminine appearance. Yet the leather is firm and rigid, the bag closes onto it's magnetic tab on its own, I never have to worry about pushing it shut. 

The handles are sturdy and very comfortable to carry on the shoulders. I appreciate the wide interior, there is only one zip pocket otherwise you're free to use a bag insert or to just throw things in. The bottom is very structured so it's easy to grab things.

The colour is a deep coffee colour with slight red undertones. And the finish is nice and glossy with natural imperfections/wrinkles in the leather which almost looks intentional. The lining is cotton and thick, I'd say it's pretty good quality. 

The branding is minimal, the brand name can be found in the inside of the bag, in two (out of four) of the metal accents and lastly its debossed on one side of the bag at the bottom centre. 

It came with a cotton/linen dust bag with a wide opening. The handbag didn't have a tag but the tag on the dust bag says made in China.

I found this bag on the youtube channel @byShannon, check out her videos if you want another opinion. There aren't many videos of this bag on youtube but W Concept does have quite a few customer reviews. 

Of course I didn't need this bag but I found it so gorgeous that I did the good ol' pinterest collage with my wardrobe basics to see if it's a worthwhile purchase. It's not a cheap bag so I do recommend you also do your due diligence. I hope you see a piece of your current or future self in this bag before you decide to buy it.

Hey there, you powerful and confident Indian dommes of reddit, I'm looking forward to being owned and used by you for your amusement

SFW- I'm a huge movie buff and a coffee connoisseur. I love art, self deprecating humor and philosophical conversations.

What I‚Äôm looking for:

Firm but playful: A domme who wants to practice the art of both tease and discipline. A sense of humor goes a long way.

So a week or so ago I posted this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/s/uwPmxPoPgN) and had a lot of great / lovely / funny / weird responses from you all. 

Just wanted to give an update‚Ä¶.

So date 1 went reaaaally well. üôÉ I was predictably nervous as shit and sort of in awe of her in person, so I definitely didn‚Äôt take in everything she said‚Ä¶ it was a bit like trying to hear someone while also staring into the evening sun and while white noise blared really loud in your ears‚Ä¶ you know? Lovely‚Ä¶ but hard to take stuff in! But it was a very cute coffee date and I managed to remain coherent enough to decide date 2!

We planned date 2 (dinner and wine üòä)‚Ä¶ but then before that booking came around we snuck in a walk the day before, so date 3 came before date 2 üòÑ, real cute stuff.

Dinner and wine was amazing‚Ä¶ stayed til the restaurant closed, then chatted and such all night. Just got home. She‚Äôs a bit of a delight. Super lush. What a time to be alive. ü´†

Just wanted to share that wholesomeness with you this morning Reddit. I‚Äôll probably leave it there unless anything significant happens in the future!
