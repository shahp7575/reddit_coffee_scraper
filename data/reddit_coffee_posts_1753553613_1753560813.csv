1ma30no,https://www.reddit.com/r/minnesotabeer/comments/1ma30no/onelicense_could_help_struggling_breweries_an/,"""One-License"" could help struggling breweries (an essay).","I own and operate a brewpub in Minneapolis. In January 2013, I attended my second Minnesota Craft Brewers Guild Meeting. The first full member meeting with the newly elected guild board is held in January every year after the first guild board meeting. As a new member, I was not privy to the politics and in-fighting within the Guild Membership. I was naïve to think that the new momentum and exploding popularity of the industry could help us get the public on board for some major deregulation. After all, it worked for the taproom/Surly law (I later learned even THAT was contentious within the Guild).

During the meeting, the committee chairs all gave their reports. The legislative committee, chaired by a like-minded mentor of mine announced that the Guild would not be taking a legislative stance that year. When the floor opened for questions, I asked “Is there any way for the committee to reconsider that stance?” There were grumbles throughout the room. The Chair confirmed. The Guild would not take a legislative stance in 2013.

 I skipped right to the point:

 “I think it is a huge mistake to squander this momentum and not make moves to unify the brewpub and taproom licenses into one brewer license.” I said.

 My mentor said, “I agree with you, but there are some in the Guild who don’t.”

 “Who? Who could possibly be against legislation that would benefit all of us?”

Crickets. But you could tell who was against “one license” by the heads that were looking down or away.

A couple months later, the legislature proposed a 600% increase in beer excise tax. This didn’t effect exempt smaller breweries, but the bigger breweries were panicked and furious.  They called a special guild meeting despite the Guild’s lack of legislative stance. At the meeting, I pointed out that, while I agree that the Guild should lobby against the tax increase, the Guild’s hands are tied because it has no authority to use resources to fight the tax increase. The tax increase ultimately failed. I again, made the point that the Guild should support a unified license AND be a united front against excessive taxation. One distributing taproom member said, “What if I could sell liquor?”, as if his selling liquor would somehow harm my business. I said, “That would be Great!""

For the next few years, as the Guild was growing fast with many members having many different concerns, I kept rocking the boat (irritating many members) making my case for one license at every single Guild meeting. Why wouldn’t we fight for taprooms to have a full liquor license and for brewpubs to be able to distribute? Why are we, as a Guild, choosing to deny ourselves of additional revenue streams? It makes absolutely no sense. I was learning that the Guild really isn’t a guild at all. It is a mechanism for the larger breweries to get what they want and to block what they don’t want.

Fast forward to the current, over-saturated, post pandemic, local, craft beer climate that has dramatically changed since 2012. Now, we have THC beverages with full-service dispensaries on the horizon, Gen Z who drink far less alcohol than other generations, AND people just drinking less in general. Those extra revenue streams would come in handy right about now.

The Guild’s answer? Was it the real fix of one license? No. The guild threw everything they had at solidifying the THC beverage (not beer) revenue stream and allowing taprooms to sell 4 and 6 packs. Nothing for brewpubs or smaller, non-packaging breweries. And they did all of this by agreeing to not ask for any legislation for 5 years.

With the current headwinds in the industry, breweries need every revenue stream they can get. Some taprooms have added coffee shops and/or a kitchen. Other taprooms have abandon distribution altogether and became brewpubs (see St. Paul Brewing) so they can serve spirits/cocktails/wine and other outside alcohol.

The ship might have sailed on one-license being a fix-all for the industry. After nearly 13 years in business I’ve resigned to the reality: One-License probably will not happen before I retire. While it would be nice to roll a keg out to another bar, or sell a keg or two for a wedding here and there, the battle doesn't seem worth it at this point. I never did believe in the taproom model; investing in extremely expensive equipment to make a very slim margin on wholesale distribution, while selling only your own beer in a taproom, and only food trucks to feed customers. I never thought the model was sustainable. Despite the stupid laws, I’d rather operate a brewpub.

One-license would have helped a lot of these struggling taprooms with new revenue streams in spirits/cocktails/wine/other outside alcohol. And they wouldn’t be as dependent on producing THC beverages to prop them up. Brewpubs could have a small distribution revenue stream, while getting more exposure by distributing to bars and restaurants miles away.

 I think the Guild leadership and some breweries were woefully short-sighted when they opposed one-license many years ago. Now it’s biting them in the ass. Once we have full cannabis sales in MN, the demand for THC beverages will dry up. Then what?

ByteRogue is a minimalist puzzle-tactics coffee-break roguelike that I was working on as a passion project. You play as a wizard-thief using spells to plunder a warehouse while fending off the security robots guarding the facility. It's designed with a simple 2-button control scheme and streamlined menu-free gameplay, while still leaving its rules vague for discoverability and learning.

I made ByteRogue mainly from my own frustrations with trying to find traditional roguelikes that are easy to get into. This is my take on an entry-level traditional roguelike that can potentially work as a jumping-off point for the genre, condensing the genre's raw core gameplay (moving on a grid, bumping into enemies to attack them, using items to get out of tricky situations) into a puzzle-tactics experience with a focus on positional manipulation.

I also took inspirations from some of Michael Brough's works ([Zaga-33](https://smestorp.itch.io/zaga-33), [868-HACK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274700/868HACK/), [Cinco Paus](https://smestorp.itch.io/cinco-paus)) as well as the puzzle game [Unending](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2528940/Unending/).

Please check out ByteRogue if you're interested! It's currently on its launch sale and is also in a bundle with my previous game.

This may sound like gibberish as my memory of this book is very vague (I just can't get it out of my head.)

I studied this book (short story??) at university when studying fantastique literature. Here is my brief, very fragmented, memory of the plot.

A woman is trapped under the rubble of a collapsed house. In her pain, misery and anger, she curses a woman across town (a doppelgänger?) for escaping the reality that she's currently living. Why couldn't it have been her instead?

I recall something about the doppelgänger going into a coffee shop and meeting her future husband, to the misery of the woman trapped under the rubble, who felt that it should have been her.

The whole story is basically trying to figure out what is true. Is the doppelgänger even real? Or is she a made up by the woman under the rubble as an attempt to escape her reality? Is the idea of a woman stuck under rubble completely made up in the mind of the doppelgänger, who feels guilty about life? Or is it all real and the supernatural is at play?

I assume what I have written is complete rubbish and nonsensical, but its all I have. if anyone can figure it out, you are a true genius! Thanks :)",1,1753560366.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

An asylum seeker and her children face the terrifying new reality of immigration hearings.

# When ICE Agents Are Waiting Outside the Courtroom

An asylum seeker and her children face the terrifying new reality of immigration hearings.

Earlier this month in downtown Manhattan, on the second floor of a deli near Federal Plaza, a twenty-eight-year-old named Mercedes waited anxiously as she prepared for the possibility of her arrest. She was with her eleven-year-old daughter, Jhuliana, who had just finished sixth grade in the Bronx, and her toddler, who was born in New York shortly after Mercedes and Jhuliana crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, in the summer of 2023. The young family sat at a table near a waist-high glass railing that overlooked the cash registers on the first floor, and watched as uniformed men from the Department of Homeland Security filed in and out for coffee and breakfast. “I saw on TikTok the other day that some guys from *ICE* came into a restaurant and sent everyone running, but they were just getting something to eat,” Mercedes said, laughing nervously. Her toddler, who was almost two, leaned over the railing and called out to the agents in baby gibberish, but the agents did not acknowledge her. “Come, come here!” Mercedes said, and the child ran back into her arms.

It was just before eight in the morning. At nine, Mercedes was scheduled to appear for a “master hearing” in her immigration case. A master hearing is typically the first court hearing in such a case, during which the judge explains respondents’ rights and responsibilities, takes pleadings, and sets a date for a future hearing, at which point respondents with claims to asylum can present any evidence. But, since the spring, federal agents have been lining the hallways and lobbies of the government buildings at 26 Federal Plaza, 290 Broadway, and 201 Varick Street, waiting to arrest migrants as soon as they step out of the courtroom. Initially, in what was perhaps the most commonly observed setup, D.H.S. lawyers would request that respondents’ immigration cases be dismissed; the Department of Justice has encouraged its immigration judges to grant those requests quickly, allowing for migrants’ rapid detention and deportation by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents waiting outside. Now many migrants are being detained regardless of the status of their case. “I just can’t in good faith advise someone to go to Federal Plaza,” Nuala O’Doherty-Naranjo, a New York-based immigration lawyer who is also a well-known community organizer in Queens, told me, just a few days before Mercedes’s scheduled appearance. “Two weeks ago, I would have said maybe. But now? No way.”

After the Trump Administration began making arrests at the courthouses, a couple of months ago, an anti-deportation advocacy group called New Sanctuary Coalition started sending observers to accompany migrants to their federal hearings. “We don’t believe that anyone should be deported,” a Ph.D. student and New Sanctuary volunteer named Brian told me when he arrived at the deli, a little before 8:30 *A.M*. Brian, who didn’t speak Spanish, handed Mercedes a Know Your Rights flyer. I translated as he asked her to sign a privacy waiver authorizing New Sanctuary to access her information and records in case of her detainment by *ICE*. Two other New Sanctuary volunteers would be accompanying Mercedes that morning—Jessica, an E.S.L. teacher, and Amelia, a film editor, both of whom arrived shortly after Brian. I asked the three of them if they ever spoke out on behalf of the migrants during the process. They said no. “It would actually do more harm than good,” Amelia said. Their support was largely moral, for companionship and comfort. There was not much more they could help with.

I planned to observe the hearing, too. Earlier this year, I wrote about Mercedes and her family for a piece in this magazine about how TikTok has [changed the way](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/01/13/on-tiktok-every-migrant-is-living-the-american-dream) that would-be migrants from rural areas in South America think about life in the U.S., and how they stay in touch with their families once they get here. I have remained in contact with Mercedes since the story’s publication, and helped her connect with some local community organizations that offer free social services to recently arrived migrants in the city. In the weeks leading up to her scheduled hearing, I joined Mercedes for two visits to a free legal clinic in Queens that takes place every Tuesday in the basement of one of these nonprofits, Voces Latinas. There, Nuala O’Doherty-Naranjo holds walk-in consultations with migrants who are unable to afford their own legal representation. During her first visit, in mid-June, Mercedes was one of dozens of migrants who waited patiently for their turn. A few months earlier, *ICE* had entered the organization’s basement, apparently looking for someone, so now the waiting room’s windows were taped over with cardboard paper and the door automatically locked from the inside.

After nearly three hours, Mercedes entered O’Doherty-Naranjo’s small office. In American-accented Spanish, O’Doherty-Naranjo told Mercedes that the judge who was assigned to her case was “difficult,” but that her asylum application—which was based upon striking claims of sexual violence, stalking and death threats, and police indifference in Ecuador due to her Kichwa-Puruhá Indigenous ethnicity—was strong. Mercedes, whose first language was Kichwa, only learned Spanish when she was around ten years old, and had trouble understanding the lawyer. “She spoke so quickly,” Mercedes said as we left the consultation, a bit bewildered; later, the Voces Latinas staff helped her file a motion to attend her master hearing virtually, instead of in person, which would have allowed her to proceed with her case without potential confrontations with *ICE*. A few days afterward, the court denied her request. Barring a medical emergency or an out-of-state move, Mercedes would have to show up. “Bring your kids,” O’Doherty-Naranjo told Mercedes on her second visit to the clinic, three weeks later. She hoped that *ICE* agents might be more reluctant to detain a mother with her children, because of limitations against holding children in detention alongside adults. “So, the floor where a lot of migrants are sleeping right now, they won’t put a kid there,” she continued. “They’ll literally have to get her a hotel room and put an *ICE* agent at the door. And nobody has the time or the money to do that.” Still, O’Doherty-Naranjo admitted with a sigh, “These days you really never know.”

We were all uneasy when we left the deli for the federal courthouse, at quarter to nine. We were delayed by a few minutes because Jhuliana wanted to buy a packet of Welch’s Fruit Snacks for her sister with a five-dollar bill she’d fished out of her yellow school backpack. “I’m very nervous,” Mercedes told me.

Together, she and Jhuliana pushed the baby’s stroller down the street to the courthouse, passing through metal detectors and placing their belongings in an X-ray machine downstairs, before riding the elevator to a room where men dressed in business-casual attire seemed to be observing us. We walked into a long hallway in which several sheets of pink paper were taped to the wall, listing respondents’ names and hearing times underneath their assigned judge and corresponding courtroom number. The New Sanctuary volunteers, eager to help, began carefully examining the lists. Meanwhile, Jhuliana, who had memorized the judge’s name, almost immediately found the docket with their names near the end of the hallway.

“Here it is,” she said, quietly, in Spanish. “The twentieth floor.”

Two masked federal agents were standing at the entrance to the waiting room as we got off the elevator. Both wore gaiter masks that covered their faces up to their eyes. Both had on “New York” baseball caps, and on one the letters were written in scary-looking gothic font. Mercedes and Jhuliana held their breath as they walked inside. Mercedes checked in with a court employee at a small table in the front, who told her to take a seat and wait until her hearing was called. Already, several dozen people were sitting in the rows of blue chairs. A significant number of them seemed to be observers or volunteer companions. They were mostly older, and one carried a Kamala Harris 2024 tote bag. The rest were immigrant respondents and their families, awaiting their own hearings, dressed as nicely as they could. One family had two children about Jhuliana’s age, a boy and a girl, who were dressed in shalwar kameez. A short, thin young man in a collared T-shirt, whose accent sounded Venezuelan, was present with his wife and small child. Mercedes was wearing a light-blue short-sleeve shirt, with a gold-colored necklace.

The *ICE* agents wore Army-green T-shirts under tactical vests, their large arms covered with visible tattoos, and belts equipped with a flashlight, handcuffs, and a gun. They walked up and down the length of the room, stopping occasionally to look at the people waiting in their seats. They stared at Jhuliana for a while, before Jessica sat down next to her and began engaging her in conversation. One had a stapled packet of paper, presumably with respondents’ names, photos, and other information, which he seemed to be studying as he surveyed the crowd.

At one point, they stood near the courtroom security officer, a Black man with an Allied Universal security badge, and the three of them started cracking jokes and laughing. I wanted to hear what they were saying, so I moved closer.

“Set an example,” one of the *ICE* agents said.

“I’ve been waiting to arrest one of those motherfuckers so that they back down,” said the other.

It wasn’t entirely clear who they were talking about, but I could only imagine they meant the observers. Immigration court is a public space, open to all. A few minutes later, the hearing was called. Respondents entered the courtroom first, followed by observers, some of whom were turned away for lack of space. The security officer made an announcement before he closed the door: if any of the observers “impeded” the court proceedings in any way, he would have us removed from the building and charged with trespassing. “No more games,” he said. He sounded very serious. In addition to migrants, multiple observers have already been detained in New York immigration courthouses; in what has arguably been the most high-profile arrest, Brad Lander, the city’s comptroller and a Democratic mayoral candidate, was detained at 26 Federal Plaza for several hours after accompanying a migrant out of his hearing.

After the security officer’s warning, court began. We were all told to turn off our cellphones. When called, respondents were to sit at one of two tables; a tall lawyer for the Department of Homeland Security was already at the other one. The judge was curt but courteous; a Spanish-language interpreter was available on a large video screen to his right. The first three respondents were all Spanish speakers—first a woman with two teen-age children in the audience, then the young man with a wife and small child, and finally another middle-aged woman—and all of them had addresses in the Bronx. The judge gave each of them time to find a lawyer, and set their next hearing dates for June, 2026. Then he jumped the line. “Let’s skip to the woman with the small children in the middle row,” he said. Mercedes was called to the front. The judge asked her what language she was most comfortable in, and she said, “*español*.” I wondered what would have happened had she said “Kichwa.”

The judge said that he had already given Mercedes time to find a lawyer, and asked if she had been successful. “I’m still saving up for one,” she said, echoing the Spanish words of the respondents before her. But instead of giving her more time the judge said that he would proceed today with part of her case. He verified the details of her address and her children. Because she had crossed the border illegally, near Hidalgo, Texas, without any kind of permission from a border official, he said that the U.S. government had deemed her “inadmissible,” a qualification he agreed with. If she were to be deported, the country of removal was set to Ecuador, her homeland.

Then the judge proceeded to her asylum application, which had been submitted in time. He asked her if she feared returning to her home country. “Yes,” Mercedes answered. The judge encouraged her to find representation and submit evidence for her asylum claim thirty days before her final hearing, which he set for April, 2027. If she could not find a lawyer by then, she would have to represent herself.

He was about to move on to the next person when Mercedes spoke up. “Your Honor, can I ask you for a favor?” she said.

The courtroom held its breath. “Yes,” the judge said.

“My clock, it’s been stopped, and I was wondering if Your Honor could reactivate it.”

She was referring to the hundred-and-fifty-day waiting period after which asylum seekers in the United States can apply for a work permit. Hers hadn’t been running for months. The judge said he didn’t control the clock, but it should be automatically reactivated the following day. If that didn’t happen, she could return to the fifteenth floor of the same building and inquire at the window counter.

That was it. Mercedes said thank you, and took her seat. Her baby was fussing as the next respondent began, so the judge clarified that anyone whose case had been finished for the day was free to go. Some fifteen people stood up—the previous respondents, their families, and various observers—and began to exit. Mercedes and her girls, along with the New Sanctuary volunteers, were some of the first to walk out of the room. The masked agents were standing right by the courtroom door, and no one made eye contact as we walked directly to the elevators. We got into one and pressed the button for the lobby.

“Wait, wait.” Someone rushed to the elevator before the doors closed, calling out in a loud whisper. It was the woman who had gone first, with her two teen-age children. They stepped inside, and the woman said, “Close the door, close the door.” I pressed the button several times and the door slid shut. The other migrants in the elevator looked at one another and sighed.

“*Ay, Dios, qué miedo*,” the woman said.

“What happened?” I asked in Spanish, as the elevator descended.

“I think that *ICE* arrested that man.”

“Which man?”

“The one who went second.”

“The one with the family?” I remembered him, the one who sounded Venezuelan, who was thin and short and wore a collared T-shirt.

“Yes, they stopped him when he was coming out and started talking to him. I can’t believe it.”

“It looked like they were waiting for him,” her son said.

“*Qué miedo*,” the woman said again, and she shivered.

We walked quickly through the ground-floor lobby. Mercedes was holding Jhuliana’s hand in one of hers and pushing the stroller with the other. “How do you feel?” I asked Jhuliana.

“Good,” she said.

I looked at Mercedes. “It’s good news?” I asked. She smiled gently. “Yes.”

Outside the building, we said goodbye to Amelia and Jessica, the New Sanctuary volunteers, before hurrying to the Brooklyn Bridge–City Hall subway station, where we boarded an uptown 6 train. Once we were pulling away from the station, Jhuliana finally opened up with a dramatic exhale. “I was so nervous,” she told me. “I didn’t know what was going to happen.”

Mercedes, for her part, quietly texted her sisters, her mother, and her brother on WhatsApp. She thought she’d caught a glimpse of the man *ICE* had talked to out on the street as we left, but we would never be entirely sure what happened to him. Later, when I got home, I noticed that she had posted a video to TikTok. “Madrecita de mi vida, thank you for your prayers.” The first clip, only two seconds long, showed one of the agents, masked and armed, looming over her. ♦

That night was different, I didn't want to let her go even an inch away from me, so I held her tight the whole night in my arms like if I let go of her, death was going to take me.


She had already left for work when I woke up. The wound I had felt better. I quickly gathered all my clothes that were scattered across her living room. I dressed in all those bloody clothes and called a cab to my apartment. All the voices in my mind were telling me to go back to the diner and look at her pretty face but I can't go to her dressed like this.

###

Jay was waiting for me outside my apartment.

""Well, someone had a bad night out,"" he said with a big smirk. 

""Believe it or not, It was one of the best nights I've ever had"" I replied with a bigger smirk.

""You're enjoying killing a bit too much, Eden""

""Nah, that part sucked. I'm talking about what happened after that""

""What?""

""Met a girl at a diner, She was the prettiest girl I've ever seen in my life""

""Careful, someone might fall in love""

""Yeah Yeah...""

We both chuckled and got inside the apartment. As usual, I started the day with a cup of super nice cold brew and a shot of expensive tequila. 

Gets the body moving.

""So, what are we doing about that ambush you got yourself in?"" Jay asked and I casually ignored him because I had better things to do. Right now I'm scouring through my closet.

""What do think will make me less scary and more... lovable? The good old white shirt or this Hawaiian Havana shirt thingy?""  it is a weirdly nice shirt, light blue with a fuck ton of white feathers on it.

""Eden....Seriously?""

""Jay, that Ambush can wait, I have more important things to do""

""Like what?""

I ignored him yet again. This time, I'm searching for a watch matching this shirt. I took one with an ocean-blue dial.

""Fucking a bitch isn't more important than your life, Eden"" 

""Call her a bitch again and I'll hang your ass with a collar...""

""I'm just saying, we need to figure out what exactly happened yesterday""

""And I'm saying, I will do that shit later. Now help me find a perfume""

Jay started going through my perfumes.

""What's your plan for today?"" Jay asked

""Well, first I'm going to take a nice hot shower""

""Not that plan, Eden""

""First I'll go meet the lady who saved my life and after that, I'll hunt the ones who prepared that ambush.""

""Saved your life?""

""Yeah, well..."" I lifted my shirt""... It was bad""

""Eden..."" his face lost all the color it had ""... who were these men""

""trained mercenaries ""

Jay's eyes widened ""Trained Mercenaries? Who the hell are we dealing with?""

""That's what I intend to find out. But First, I need to thank the girl""

""You sure that's a good idea... with all those Mercenaries running around?""

""Well Good Ideas have never been my thing, have it Jay?""

Jay sighed ""Be careful Eden, we don't need more trouble""

I finished getting ready, doused myself in a subtle cologne, and headed out. I took my   Matte White Corvette ZR1 and drove to my Grim Reaper's diner. On my way, I also got a White Rose for her. I got in the diner and there she was, the prettiest girl I've ever seen.

""Eden, what you are doing here?""

""I couldn't stay away,"" I admitted ""I needed to see you""

""No you don't? I'm working, please go away"" she said and my heart sank like a rock in the ocean.

""But..."" 

""... Leave, Eden""

Mhmm... Fiesty 

I broke the White Rose I bought for her.

""I'm here for a nice breakfast, Would you mind"" I pushed her aside and moved on to find a nice table.

I sat on the table waiting for my grim reaper to take my order but another waiter came

""What would you like to have, sir?"" He asked 

""Grim Reaper..."" Oops ""... I mean, that girl can take my order and you can go and bother someone else""

Of course, someone would get offended by what I said but a $500 bill took care of his feelings. He took off and started talking to my Grim Reaper. And she came straight to me. 

""What do you want?"" She asked

""You of course...an...and some Black Coffee""

She smiled at me ""I'm afraid we are out of both, you may leave now.""

""Hey... what is it? I thought you and me were alright. You forgot about yesterday?""

""Yeah, that was a one-time thing, Now leave or I'll be calling the Police"" She smiled again, and GOD! SHE LOOKS SOO CUTE!!!

""Right...""

I got up and headed straight to my car. I sat in, took my phone out, and called Jay

""Jay!""

""Yup Eden, I'm working on the guys who jumped you and...""

""Forget about that. What do you think about buying a Diner?""

""A Diner? You alright?""

""Yeah, I'm sending you the address. You get on that and I'll go find the assholes who want to kill me""

""You're acting weird man""

""Jay, have you seen a Grim Reaper?""

""A Grim What? No?""

""I have and I'm in Love with her, ofcourse I'm acting weird. Bye""

###

Sometimes in life, you don't get what you want and that's ok... It happens, you have to grow up and move on with life. But I get what I want, no matter what. 

While Jay works on buying the diner, I head to Detown Autos. That's where I purchased this beauty of a car. The place is packed with people like usual. I take a fully auto SMG with me and head straight in to meet my friend Robert. Oh yeah! and I put my Sunglasses on, to look sexy. Duh

I went in, my SMG facing the ceiling and I started shooting. Non-stop bullet shots and the sound of panic consumed the whole place and in an instant the entire place was empty.

Robert came Running ""What?! Eden? Man WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING""

I smiled, ""Robert. My friend, It's nice to see you as well. Been a While, hasn't it?""

""What are you talking about? We met yesterday""

""Yah well... Don't blame me. My memory's been a little dizzy since I almost died""

""What?""

""I'm surprised to see you surprised""

""I don't understand""

""Let me help you out a bit. My car suddenly broke down but I needed to drop some cash. So, as a normal human would do, I got a cab. No one knew where I would drop the cash, not even Jay. Now tell me, who knew?""

""I... I don't know""

""Come on Robert. The fucking Cab driver!"" everyone remained silent so I continued ""Now, everything was done perfectly up until that point but please Robert tell your cab driver that next time they should remove the sticker of Detown Auto from their windshield.""

The moment I said it, Robert started running like any prey would do when a predator catches them being stupid. But he seemed to forget that I have a fucking SMG in my hand, I shot his leg and he fell on the floor, screaming. I slowly made my way towards him and he started crawling away from me. 

It's amazing how stupid a brain starts to act when it gets shot by a bullet. Robert knows he's dead but he keeps on trying to get away. I caught him by merely walking and got really close to his face, looking into his eyes.

""Why, Robert? Why?""

""B...Because you're a Fucking Animal.""

""Ouch Robert, Why would say something so bad to me?""

""You kill whoever you fucking want. You take whatever you fucking want. You don't have a Fucking Leash and You should be in the fucking Ground."" 

""There are 8 Billion people in this world, Robert. Let them worry about me. You were loyal to me!""

He screamed, ""I was loyal to your Mother!"" 

I put the nozzle of my SMG into his Mouth, ""Loyalty doesn't end with generations... It ends with your life.""

I pulled the trigger and his head exploded, blood covered my nice shoes and trousers.

I took my phone out and called Jay.

""Eden! Tell me you find out who wanted to kill you.""

""Jay. Important things first.""

""I bought the Fucking Diner! You own it now.""

""You're such a Good Boy, Jay""

""You found them?""

""The cab driver was one of Robert's men. Robert's the one who gave out my location""

""That's Great! We'll make him tell us who's the one hellbent on killing you""

""Well...about that.""

He scoffed, ""Eden. What did you do?""

""I... kinda blew his head off""

""ofcourse you did""

""Don't you worry Jay, we'll find them""

""You're too carefree, man""

""Well, I. Have to care for someone else now. Bye""

I cut the call before he lectures me. because I need to pay a visit to someone.

###

I parked my car outside the glass door of My diner. I can see her inside, taking an order from an old guy. She's so pretty. I walk in, straight to her. 

""Hey you""

""Why are you here again?""

""Can't a guy get some lunch?"" I smirk ""Plus, I wanted to see you.""

""Eden...Look-""

I cut her off, ""Alright, alright, no need to call the cops this time. I'm just really hungry.""

She looked down, glancing at my bloody trousers ""I beg to differ, you just ate someone's soul. Let me do my job now.""

""Sure. One black coffee, please. And, whatever you recommend for dinner""

She sighs but doesn't argue, getting my order. I watch her, amused by the way she moves, and the determination in her eyes. She's different from anyone I have ever met. I can't stay away from her.

She gets busy as more customers come in. I take a sip of the black coffee, relishing the bitter taste. It reminds me of pain, Bitter but you get used to it the more you feel it and then you start to adore it...

As I finish my lunch, I notice her glancing at me, she's trying to figure out why I'm still here. I decide to pay for my lunch and give her a big tip. She came to me.

""Don't come here again. Please"" She said.

""Well, I kinda have to. I own this place now""

Her eyes widened in surprise""YOU WHAT?""

 ""I bought the place. So, I'm your boss now""

She crossed her arms ""You can't just buy a place because you want to see someone""

""Oh I absolutely can and I did. Besides, I think it's a good investment""

""Yeah right... well, I resign, Boss""

""You...What?""

""I don't want to see you daily""

""But why, Aurora?""

""I have my reasons and I don't wish to tell you""

Ouch.

""Well, you have to, and also, 3 week's notice please""

""Eden. Why are you so hellbent on being with me?""

""Because I'm in Love  with you Aurora""

""Eden I can't""

""You can't what?""

I grew up in a small town in the Midlands. Dad was a machinist, mum worked part-time at a pharmacy. Money was always tight. I wasn’t the “gifted kid” type. barely scraped through college doing a Btec in plumbing before pivoting into IT certifications and then slowly into software.

Taught myself to code at 22. It started with dumb little automation scripts, then freelancing, then building tiny apps. In 2016, I launched a super niche SaaS tool for property managers. Nothing flashy, just handled vendor scheduling, quote approvals, maintenance tickets, etc.

I was solo for 3 years, handling dev, support, billing, everything. Eventually hired one part-time dev, then another. Grew slowly. No VC, no debt, just monthly revenue reinvested into the product. It hit £70k MRR by 2021. Then £180k MRR by 2023. Last year, a bigger firm reached out to acquire it. Multiple offers followed. I sold in March.

Total deal was £14.2M with a clean exit clause. After taxes, advisors, and options I granted to my tiny team, I walked away with £9.6M in cash.

What’s surreal: I still live in the same 2-bed flat I bought in 2019. No mortgage. No car loan. No credit card debt. I sent £250k to my folks so they could retire early. I bought my brother a coffee shop he always dreamed of owning. I took 6 friends who stuck with me through the grind to Japan for 2 weeks, my treat. No Lambos. No watches. Just peace, time, and options.

Still working on what’s next, which is another really cool app idea i have. Might invest in indie devs like me. No rush.

I don’t think I’m special. I just kept building when no one cared.

Luke’s apology to Michelle for how he talked on The Viall Files (8:39)
- Luke: Only thing I want to say is out to Michelle Lally. I made a comment. It wasn't necessarily mean or aggressive, but about the issue with her mom passing and I feel like it was insensitive to even comment or acknowledge or act like I know anything. I don't know anything. 
- Luke: And my very sincere apology goes out to Michelle for even entertaining a question about it because I don't handle death in the family well, never lost a parent and can't imagine what that's like. So I wanted to put that out there.
- Kristen: And you and Michelle, kind of had a quick little chat and you said the same thing to her.
- Luke: Yeah, we exchanged a couple of texts and I said the same thing to her. I just wanted to get that out there. I don't feel good about it because I know how death affects me.
- Kristen: Yeah, that's good, babe. You know what else about Viall Files? Who wears short shorts?
- Luke: Oh my goodness.
- Kristen: Luke wears short shorts. I mean, to be fair, it was 90 degrees in the valley that day. And to be fair, when you left the house, it did not even cross my mind.
- Kristen: And I know that you're sitting on a couch in Nick and Natalie's studio and that is the framing of their camera. It did not cross my mind.
- Luke: Yeah, live and learn, I guess. I will wear pants next time. 100%
- Kristen: Because a lot of podcasts, though, are framed, the camera is like a lot closer to your face. It's like chest up or something.
- Luke: Yeah, I had no idea. And I was also on three hours of sleep going into that. So I was like, okay, I have clothes on, I have shoes on. Three cups of coffee. I'm ready to go. Let's go do this thing.
- Kristen: I thought it was a really good interview. I'm going to say that I did feel like after you guys talked about Jesse Lally and they were giving his opinion and you were like giving your opinion, which is different than Nick's and your friends, we’re friends with Jesse, I feel like after that, you kind of did seem not disinterested. That's not what I'm trying to.
- Kristen: I don't know the word I'm looking for. But you were it was kind of like, okay, let's get through these questions. And it was toward the end of the interview.
- Kristen: And I love Nick and Natalie, but I feel like he was pushing you really hard on that. You didn't give the answer that he necessarily wanted. Therefore, he was like, kept asking you again in different ways. And I wanted to be like, yo, Nick, Jesse's our friend. Sorry, we don't feel the same way. Yes, we think Jax is worse. End of story.
- Luke: Yeah, I mean, I think that just comes back to the three hours of sleep, you know, like cognitive function, whatever. It's like maybe I don't know if it's our lost interest or just like, I don't know. It was not as on point anymore.
- Kristen: Taxed
- Luke: Yeah, I was a little taxed at that point.

New York Times article that Kristen did (17:40)
- Kristen: I have not been doing any podcasts. I did just record with Amanda Hirsch from not skinny but not fat. So, plug there and you'll get to hear all about the valley and all of my feelings regarding that such. Oh, and just super quickly, because I got a text today from a friend saying that they saw my New York Times article.
- Kristen: And it's the first big thing that I have not plugged promoted or pushed on social media, even though the photo shoot was so much fun and it was so cute. I was really excited and very honored to do an interview with New York Times. And when the article came out, I was disappointed.
- Kristen: We had a great interview. We talked about a lot of stuff and I felt and feel that when the article came out, it was just so much backtracking. It was so much about what was, rather than what is and what will be in my life.
- Kristen. It was so hyper-focused around Vanderpump Rules. And I was just a little bummed out. Like, man, all of the stuff and that's kind of where it lies. So just disappointed, but still very honored. The photo shoot was so cute. So you guys should maybe check it out. I don't know. Just check out the photos. Maybe I'll just post the photos.

1ma2qp2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1ma2qp2/explore_the_ninja_cfp301_is_this_the_best_drip/,Explore the Ninja CFP301: Is This the Best Drip Coffee Maker Yet?,"The Ninja CFP301 coffee maker offers an entirely new way to approach your daily caffeine routine, and I couldn't wait to test it out. Combining the ability to tackle both coffee grounds and K-Cup pods is no small feat, yet this machine integrates these functionalities effortlessly. Its sleek black design, compact dimensions at 9.13""D x 11.39""W x 15.54""H, and fully automatic operation mode make it an eye-catching and practical addition to my countertop. With its programmable settings and included features like a fold-away milk frother and a removable water tank, it aims to be a standout piece for coffee enthusiasts of all preferences.

**User-Friendly Design for a Variety of Brews**  
The design is clearly focused on maximizing utility while minimizing clutter. I appreciated the multi-position water reservoir, which can be shifted to the side or the back depending on your kitchen layout. It makes refilling a breeze, especially when I’m in a rush. Additionally, the fold-away frother is easy to use and just as easy to clean—a big perk when you’re someone, like me, who enjoys the occasional latte or cappuccino without making it a messy ordeal.

**Performance That Impresses Even Under Pressure**  
This machine is shockingly efficient for something that offers 13 different brewing sizes, covering everything from small cups to full carafes. The Ninja DualBrew Pro truly lives up to its name. I love pairing it with my favorite K-Cups on rushed mornings, but it also shines when brewing specialty drinks with coffee grounds. Switching between the two systems is seamless, and I was amazed that this coffee maker brewed pods faster than my old Keurig machine. That speed is worth its weight in gold before heading off to work!

**Check [Ninja CFP301 price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b08qzsn97z/)**  

**Flexible Brew Style Options**  
Something that made me especially curious was the machine’s four brew style choices—Classic, Rich, Over Ice, and Specialty. While experimenting, I noticed how the Classic was perfect for my everyday cup, while the Rich brew captured deeper notes for more indulgent moments. The Over Ice setting actually surprised me by brewing coffee strong enough not to feel diluted when poured over ice. As a bonus, the Specialty brew allowed me to create coffee concentrates; my inner barista was thrilled.

**Independent Hot Water Function for More than Just Coffee**  
As someone who regularly drinks tea or occasionally needs hot water for recipes like instant oatmeal, the independent hot water system caught my eye early. It eliminates any coffee-related cross-contamination, which was a relief since no one wants their chamomile tea tasting like yesterday’s espresso. The two temperature settings—hot and boil—are excellent for brewing tea bags or preparing instant soups and hot chocolate.

**Good Points**  
- Compatible with both coffee grounds and K-Cups  
- Multiple brew sizes ranging from single cups to full carafes  
- Faster brewing capability compared to traditional Keurig models  
- Fold-away frother for lattes, cappuccinos, and more  
- Removable and multi-position water reservoir  

**Adverse Aspects**  
- Slightly bulky compared to simpler pod-only machines  
- The paper filter system can feel outdated versus reusable options  
- Specialty brew strength might not satisfy those looking for super-intense espresso  

**Challengers**  
Compared to some other premium multi-function coffee makers, the Ninja CFP301 confidently holds its ground. Machines like the Keurig K-Elite are strong contenders in the pod-only category, but they lack the versatility of being able to use coffee grounds. Other drip coffee makers, such as the Breville Precision Brewer, offer a similar level of advanced brewing modes but don’t cater to K-Cup users, making them less convenient for households like mine, where preferences vary wildly. Ultimately, that dual capability is where the Ninja coffee maker really excels—it offers an all-in-one solution that few in the market can rival.

**True Value**  
While a premium coffee machine like this requires an upfront investment, its versatile design and feature set make it a cost-effective alternative to purchasing multiple devices. For someone who often craves lattes, iced coffee, and simple drip brews, this system combines them into a single unit. It takes the pressure off buying both a pod machine and a specialty brewer, so sticking to one durable, efficient product ends up saving money in the long run.

Based on your experience:

- What amount USD or NTD do you need to make annually to eek it out there? (I’m thinking small 1 room apartment in Taipei, not going to nice dinners, eating street food, no expensive entertainment or travel— basically a meager “new-to-NYC” type of existence where you watch your money and live extremely frugally)

- What amount USD or NTD do you need to make annually to live a comfortable existence? (A decent studio or 1 bedroom with a small kitchen, occasional restaurants and coffee shops, some regional travel, buying clothes if I wanted to— basically a middle class US lifestyle) 

WILDCARD
- Does this change dramatically in any particular neighborhoods in New Taipei City? Are there any neighborhoods or apartment buildings that you specifically recommend that would be more comfortable day to day while still being relatively close to Taipei by Metro?

I’ve been using this stainless steel coffee maker daily, and it’s like having a personal barista on my countertop. As someone who takes their morning brew seriously, I was excited to see how this model stood out with its much-talked-about MultiStream Technology.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  
This coffee maker has a sleek, modern design that immediately caught my eye. The stainless steel wrap doesn’t just look good—it adds a sense of durability. It’s compact enough to fit my kitchen counter without hogging all the space, but not so small that it feels cramped. The digital display screen is user-friendly and gives the whole unit a high-end vibe. I’ve had guests comment on how it looks like something out of a professional café, and I can’t say I blame them.

**Brewing Customization Options**  
Being able to fully customize my coffee is such a unique perk. With options for three strength and three temperature settings, I’ve tailored my morning cup to perfection. On days when I need stronger coffee to get me going, the settings work like a charm. If I’m craving an iced coffee, brewing directly over ice has been super convenient. Gone are the days of experimenting with ice cubes in hot coffee and ending up with a watery disaster.

**Check [Keurig 5000350800 K-Supreme Plus] price on Amazon.**

**Brewing Performance and MultiStream Technology**  
This feature deserves its hype. Using MultiStream Technology, it saturates coffee grounds more effectively, pulling out fuller flavors. The difference compared to traditional single-serve brewers is noticeable. Whether it’s light roast, dark roast, or tea, the taste feels more robust. I tested it against a friend’s K-Classic, and honestly, the K-Supreme Plus packed much more punch in flavor. I also love how it lets me pick from various brew sizes—4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 ounces. I’ve experimented with all sizes, and even the smallest one feels satisfying.

**Advantages**  
• MultiStream Technology truly enhances flavor profiles.  
• The 78 oz. removable reservoir saves constant refilling—it covers about nine cups before needing attention.  
• Back-to-back brewing lets me quickly make a second cup without waiting.  
• Highly travel mug friendly; my tall mug fits without any awkward adjustments.  

**Noise and Operation Mode**  
One aspect I didn’t find overly impressive was the noise level. The semi-automatic operation, while efficient, occasionally produces a hum that’s louder than I’d like early in the morning. It’s not disruptive enough to make me reconsider using the product, but worth mentioning if noise is a concern. On the flip side, the brewing process itself is so fast that the noise doesn’t persist long.

**Negatives**  
• Noise level could be improved during operation.  
• Lacks a built-in filter for reusable pods; you’ll need to buy the My K-Cup separately.  

**Programming Favorites for Households**  
If you’re like me and share a coffee maker with others, you’ll appreciate the programmable favorites. My partner likes their coffee stronger and hotter, while I prefer medium strength with a regular temperature. This brewer allows up to three users to save their preferences—no more guesswork! Adjusting the buttons for our individual options has become a thing of the past.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this to competitor products like the Nespresso Vertuo and Breville Precision Brewer, the K-Supreme Plus holds its ground well. It shines with its affordability and customizable brewing features, which you won’t get with the Vertuo’s capsule-only design. On the other hand, the Breville offers more versatility with temperature precision, especially for pour-over coffee enthusiasts. But for single-serve brewing with minimal fuss, the K-Supreme Plus takes the lead for me.

**Worth Every Penny**  
This model offers a great balance between value and features. It’s not the most affordable option out there, but the level of customization and quality feel well worth the price. With its durable look and consistently strong performance, it easily justifies its cost for avid coffee drinkers like me. It also pays off in convenience, particularly when I’m brewing coffee in a rush.

I met a Snowflake engineering manager last week.

Super smart guy, went to Harvey Mudd and actually studied economics before moving to CS.

I asked him, what’s going on your stock? It got crushed in 2022 and never seem to recovered.

He hesitated and gave me a smile.

We then had a 2-hour long conversation where he told me the pre-consensus comeback story:

1. Data warehousing is becoming the bottleneck for large enterprise AI adoption.  Think Nike not startup use case.

2. Snowflake is one of a few multi-cloud warehouses that is SQL-centric with enterprise-level speed and reliability.

3. Snowflake is quietly building out its own AI suite of products that leverages the training from its customers - a dataset that by itself builds a unique moat.

At the end of our what was supposed to be a quick 15-min coffee chat, I was confused (but in a good way).  My entire view of Snowflake as a dead cat was shattered.

Not sure if this resonates with anyone, but definitely taking a second look as NVDA hits ATHs every week.

Let me share my experience with this incredible journey that takes you through some of the most breathtaking spots on the island.

I researched several tour options before choosing this particular Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (which you can check out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island). The 8-hour duration was perfect - long enough to see everything without feeling rushed.

Starting from Waikiki early morning, we made our way clockwise around the island. The route follows the coastal roads, giving you constant ocean views while covering both the windward and leeward sides of Oahu. Our guide mentioned that they specifically designed the route to maximize sightseeing while minimizing travel time.

Some notable distances between major stops:
- Waikiki to Diamond Head: 3 miles
- Diamond Head to Halona Blowhole: 7 miles
- North Shore stretch: roughly 20 miles
- Dole Plantation to Waikiki: 25 miles

What impressed me most was how the tour efficiently covered such a large distance while still allowing plenty of time at each stop. We never felt rushed despite covering 120 miles of terrain. The air-conditioned bus made the journey comfortable, and the stops were well-timed for photos, snacks, and bathroom breaks.

One practical tip: since you're covering significant distance, bring motion sickness pills if you're sensitive to winding roads, especially around the North Shore area. The roads there can get quite curvy.

Time management was excellent throughout the journey. We spent:
- 30-45 minutes at major stops like Waimea Valley
- 15-20 minutes at photo opportunities
- About an hour for lunch on the North Shore
- Brief stops at coffee and macadamia nut farms

Something I particularly appreciated was that despite covering such extensive ground, the tour never felt like just a driving experience. Each mile offered something unique - from coastal views to mountain ranges, tropical forests to historic sites.

For anyone concerned about spending too much time on a bus, don't be. The distance is broken up perfectly with strategic stops, and the scenery along the way is part of the experience. You're literally circumnavigating an entire island, seeing how the landscape changes from the busy south shore to the laid-back north shore.

If you're planning to book this tour (which I highly recommend), you can reserve your spot through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. The price includes all entrance fees and transportation, making it a great value considering the distance covered and attractions visited.

The circle island route truly offers the most comprehensive way to experience Oahu in a single day. You'll cover more ground than you could possibly manage on your own, all while learning about Hawaiian history and culture from knowledgeable guides.",1,1753559502.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I grew up in a small town in the Midlands. Dad was a machinist, mum worked part-time at a pharmacy. Money was always tight. I wasn’t the “gifted kid” type. barely scraped through  college doing a Btec in plumbing before pivoting into IT certifications and then slowly into software.

Taught myself to code at 22. It started with dumb little automation scripts, then freelancing, then building tiny apps. In 2016, I launched a super niche SaaS tool for property managers. Nothing flashy, just handled vendor scheduling, quote approvals, maintenance tickets, etc.

I was solo for 3 years, handling dev, support, billing, everything. Eventually hired one part-time dev, then another. Grew slowly. No VC, no debt, just monthly revenue reinvested into the product. It hit £70k MRR by 2021. Then £180k MRR by 2023. Last year, a bigger firm reached out to acquire it. Multiple offers followed. I sold in March.

Total deal was £14.2M with a clean exit clause. After taxes, advisors, and options I granted to my tiny team, I walked away with £9.6M in cash.

What’s surreal: I still live in the same 2-bed flat I bought in 2019. No mortgage. No car loan. No credit card debt. I sent £250k to my folks so they could retire early. I bought my brother a coffee shop he always dreamed of owning. I took 6 friends who stuck with me through the grind to Japan for 2 weeks, my treat. No Lambos. No watches. Just peace, time, and options.

Still working on what’s next, which is another really cool app idea i have. Might invest in indie devs like me. No rush.

I don’t think I’m special. I just kept building when no one cared.

To give an idea of a scope of what they have, apart from a a fully equipped gym with all brand new equipment (no gripes there), they have:

- A sauna
- Three small indoor pools (6c, 10c and 35c)
- A outdoor pool that is also shared by the building occupants
- reformer pilaties room with about 30 machines
- Stretch and mobility space (warm-up cool down, small area)
- A body build mini gym space for high intense workouts and classes
- 2 hypobaric pods
- 2 cryotherapy pods
- 2 IR saunas
- 2 lymphatic compressions
- 2 PEMF mat beds
- A bookable nutritionist & coaches
- A bookable RN who comes on site three days a week for IV drips of vitamins and supplements should you want it
- The lobby cafe and bar, with coffee and takeaway lunches to buy
- A bookable conference room /phone booth rooms
- bookable classes for workouts, pilaties, yoga, sound meditation, intensive high-energy.
- Plus lots of little things around the venue, still/sparkling and tea stations, hot/cold face towels, full bathrooms with steam irons and such for the business types etc

The only thing I have spotted they are legit missing is some more boxing-style equipment and classes. They have some, but not like other gyms I've seen, but that can vary place to place. They have said as they work through request and demands they will change things but yeah.

Also it's only open 5-9pm at this stage during week days and 6:30 - 6pm on weekends, which they may increase as they get more people in. So not even 24hrs - I think at least the gym part should be open for that, even if they close up the rest and the bookable room areas.

I recently moved overseas and had to part ways with my old setup (Breville Bambino + SGP + a cheap drip machine). I’m now planning to build a new home coffee setup and could really use some input from the community. 

I’ve already purchased an automated pour-over-like drip machine, and I’m planning to get a Gaggia Classic Pro E24 soon. As for the grinder, I’m between two Eureka grinders. 

I’ll be single dosing everything. Weigh in, grind, purge, brew. I’ll use the grinder for roughly 60% pour-over/drip and 40% espresso. The budget is tight, but I’m willing to stretch it if the upgrade is truly worth it. Grinder options are quite limited in the country I live in, so I’ve narrowed it down to these two: Eureka Oro Single Dose Pro (€688) or Eureka Mignon Crono + Specialità 55mm Burr Upgrade + Eureka Single Dose Kit which includes single-dose hopper, bellows, catch cup, and portafilter fork (€392). 

My questions and concerns are:
1. Since Crono is designed for filter, is the motor strong and consistent enough for espresso, especially after the burr upgrade? 
2. How does the Specialità burr upgrade compare to the Oro Pro’s burrs? 
3. Will switching beans often (filter vs. espresso) be a hassle? 
4. How bad is retention and purging on the modded Crono setup? 
5. Is the Oro really worth the price difference in terms of workflow, consistency, and long-term value? 
6. Has anyone here used the modded Crono for both espresso and filter with minimal fuss? Any regrets?

Unfortunately, due to tax and shipping constraints, I can’t get the Niche Zero.

**Material Composition:** The materials used in the construction of a 750ml bottle directly influence its durability, weight, and potential impact on the taste and safety of its contents. Common materials include stainless steel, glass, and various plastics such as Tritan and polyethylene terephthalate (PET).Each material possesses its own set of advantages and disadvantages.Stainless steel is known for its robustness and resistance to corrosion, while glass offers a neutral taste profile and is easy to clean. Plastics offer lightweight and cost-effective solutions, with Tritan being a popular BPA-free option.

**insulation Capabilities:** For users who intend to carry hot or cold beverages, insulation is a critical feature. Vacuum-insulated stainless steel bottles excel at maintaining temperature, keeping drinks hot for hours and cold for even longer. Double-walled construction with an air gap can also provide some degree of insulation, although not as effective as vacuum insulation. The specific insulation technology employed and the thickness of the insulating layer determine the bottle's ability to minimize heat transfer.**Sealing Mechanism:** The bottle's sealing mechanism is crucial for preventing leaks and spills, especially during transport. Screw-top lids with silicone gaskets are commonly used and provide a reliable seal. Flip-top lids with locking mechanisms offer convenient one-handed operation, but their sealing effectiveness can vary.Push-button lids with internal seals are another option, often found in insulated bottles designed for hot beverages. The quality of the sealing mechanism and the tightness of the seal directly impact the bottle's portability and suitability for active lifestyles.**Ergonomic Design:** The shape and size of the bottle, as well as the presence of features like textured grips and carrying loops, influence its ease of use and portability. A bottle with a narrow profile is easier to hold and fits comfortably in most cup holders. Textured surfaces enhance grip, especially when the bottle is wet. Carrying loops or handles facilitate transportation, notably when the bottle is full. Ergonomic design considerations contribute considerably to the overall user experience.

**Durability and Construction:** The overall construction quality and durability of the bottle determine its ability to withstand the rigors of daily use. Stainless steel bottles tend to be the most durable, resisting dents and scratches. Glass bottles are more fragile but can be reinforced with protective sleeves.Plastic bottles vary in durability depending on the type of plastic used and the thickness of the walls. A well-constructed bottle will withstand accidental drops and impacts without cracking or leaking.

Key features of high-end 750ml bottles frequently enough include:

* Double-walled vacuum insulation
* Food-grade stainless steel construction
* Leak-proof silicone seals
* BPA-free materials
* Powder-coated finish for enhanced grip and durability

## Core Benefits

The advantages of using a high-quality 750ml bottle extend beyond simply carrying liquids. These bottles offer increased convenience, improved health benefits, and notable environmental advantages compared to single-use alternatives. By choosing a well-designed and durable 750ml bottle, consumers can enjoy a range of practical benefits in their daily lives.

**hydration on the Go:** Having a 750ml bottle readily available encourages consistent hydration throughout the day. This is especially beneficial for individuals leading active lifestyles or working in environments where access to water is limited. Carrying a personal 750ml bottle ensures access to fresh water without the need to purchase disposable bottles repeatedly, promoting overall health and well-being.

**Temperature control for Beverages:** Insulated 750ml bottles keep beverages at the desired temperature for extended periods. Whether you prefer hot coffee during a morning commute or chilled water during a workout, these bottles maintain optimal temperature, enhancing your drinking experience. This feature is particularly valuable for those who enjoy outdoor activities or long days away from home.

**Environmentally Friendly Choice:** opting for a reusable 750ml bottle significantly reduces the consumption of single-use plastic bottles, contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle. By minimizing plastic waste, consumers can lessen their environmental impact and support efforts to reduce pollution and conserve natural resources. This shift towards reusable bottles is a key step in promoting a more environmentally conscious society.**Cost Savings Over Time:** While the initial investment in a high-quality 750ml bottle might potentially be higher than purchasing disposable bottles, the long-term cost savings are substantial.Over time, the expense of buying bottled water repeatedly far exceeds the price of a durable, reusable bottle. This cost-effective solution not only benefits the environment but also provides significant financial savings.

**Improved Taste and Purity:** Reusable 750ml bottles, especially those made from stainless steel or glass, prevent the leaching of chemicals into beverages, ensuring a pure and untainted taste. Unlike some plastic bottles that can impart a plastic taste or odor, these materials maintain the flavor of the contents without compromising the quality of the drink. This is especially important for those who are sensitive to taste or concerned about the potential health effects of plastic leaching.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about 750ml bottles can help consumers make informed decisions based on their individual needs and preferences. Here we answer some frequently asked questions.

**Are 750ml bottles dishwasher safe?**
This depends on the material and construction of the bottle.Many stainless steel and some plastic bottles are dishwasher safe, but it's important to check the manufacturer's instructions.

Regular cleaning is essential for maintaining hygiene. Use warm,soapy water and a bottle brush to scrub the interior thoroughly. For hard-to-reach areas,you can use a mixture of baking soda and water or vinegar and water. Rinse the bottle thoroughly after washing and allow it to air dry completely to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria.

**What is the best material for a 750ml bottle if I'm concerned about chemicals leaching into my drinks?**
Stainless steel and glass are the safest options for minimizing chemical leaching. these materials are non-reactive and do not contain harmful chemicals like BPA. While some plastic bottles are labeled as BPA-free, stainless steel and glass offer a higher level of assurance for those concerned about potential health risks.

**How durable are stainless steel 750ml bottles compared to plastic ones?**
Stainless steel bottles are significantly more durable than plastic bottles.They can withstand more significant impacts and are less likely to crack or break. Stainless steel is also resistant to corrosion and rust, making it a long-lasting option. Plastic bottles, while lighter, are more susceptible to damage from drops and scratches.

1ma2dtm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma2dtm,5 week progress pictures/ Some Things I’ve Learned Early On.,"First and foremost. If you can clock me from my pictures then you didn’t see this 😐. Here’s my NSV pictures as tax. Also, my work pants definitely require a belt otherwise they’d fall to the floor. My belt end also tucks nicely into the next belt loop. It’s the little things 🥰. 

Anyway, I just started week 7. I’m still a newbie, but just in case there’s any newer newbies I wanted to share some of my beginner insights that can be considered early on.

Food:
-“Real” food protein sources have been the best for taste and satisfaction. Hard boiled eggs, cottage cheese cups, low fat string cheese, Italian dressing marinated chicken. All of these I favor much more than protein bars and chips. They have their time and place. But I don’t particularly enjoy them, especially the first few days after shot day.
-Sola Bagels are a game changer. They’re high in protein and fiber and taste the most like regular bagels. I honestly believe that these personally attribute heavily to regular bowel movements.
-Fried food is what gives me sulfur burps. Specifically french fries. Personally I don’t think it’s worth it.
-I used to be a coffee creamer girlie. Now I make protein coffee. I tried the Premier Protein thing and I just couldn’t get behind it. What works best for me is mixing skim Fairlife Milk with Ghost Cinnabon Protein Powder, then using that as my creamer. If you let it rest for a few minutes any clumps dissolve away.
-Calorie tracking is really helpful. Unless it’s something that is too triggering, I really recommend it. It’s helped me see what cravings I experience and what foods tend to trigger poor decisions later in the day. 

Personal life:
-I haven’t told anyone but my immediate family about taking this medicine. As great as this drug is people will always have an opinion. You need to focus on you right now. Outside noise or animosity of any kind will only hold you back.
-Practice self care. Try to get regular hair cuts. Paint your nails. Fix your eyebrows. Work on skin care. Sit in the sun. Make this journey a total one if you can. This process can be confusing and emotionally taxing, you deserve to be cared for.
-Speaking with a mental health professional may be necessary. Food was a big form of comfort all my life. So many of my conversations and relationships involved food. This became incredibly apparent when my mother came to visit and all she wanted to discuss was our next plans for food. I had feelings of guilt for not being able to participate like I used to. I could go on about this. 

For the ladies:
-Keep your cycle in mind when weighing and tracking. There shouldn’t be too much of a difference, but you’ll hold onto more water during certain phases and feel more bloated. Other phases you’ll feel like a baddie. You’re still doing good and moving in the right direction as long as you stay on track.

If you’ve made it this far I really hope you found something useful out of this.

While getting coffee at the drive through today, the barista asked how I was doing (we've develop a rapport and she is aware I'm in treatment). She then asked whether I have a support system and I answered honestly.. no. That is the toughest part of this for me. The people who I anticipated would be supportive during times like these completely disappointed me. I've come to the realization of my aloneness. 

They have not joined me or driven me to one appointment. In fact, I've had to take Lyft multiple times, when one used my car, knowing I had the appointment. One racked up thousands on my credit card while I was healing from surgery. 
Staying with an out of town family member to heal after surgery triggered ptsd, having to deal with them and their abusive partner constantly throughout those weeks.

Yes, cancer sucks. But I've also learned and am dealing with... family sucks. 
Sorry for the pessimism. 

Side note, anyone dealing with treatment related brain fog? I had not even thought of the possibility until a tech asked me about brain fog in particular during recent appointment. I thought... ding, ding, ding.. that's it! Yes, yes, I am.

When the bike was back together it died on me, I was able to bump start it and have had the anti gravity lithium battery on a tender since (was reading at 9v after it sat for 3 weeks while I delt with the trans). I’ve ridden it the last 3 days on shorter trips without putting the tender back on it without issue. This morning I rode 40 min to run an errand, stopped and it sat for 15 min or so, no issues starting. Fired it back up and rode to Harley just down the street, same thing- stopped for 15 min and no issues restarting, rode back 40 min home and stopped down the street for a coffee, was inside for 15 min or so. When I went to leave and ride home the battery was dead.. was fortunately able to bump start it and ride it home. Battery bench tested at 11.5v this time so threw it on the tender for 40 min and it was back at 13.5. 

From here I went through the testing process of the regulator which checks out at the battery when revving (no jumping or dropping it DCV). So I turned to the stator. From an Ohms standpoint it measures .2 on both sides of the stator plug, it shows OL when grounded out out on a frame bolt in both sides of the plug. Which to my understanding is what you want. 

Next I moved onto AC output test from the stator wires with the bike running.. see video but I’m getting basically nothing at idle and no change when apply throttle. I saw on a TC bros check sheet that if you pass the other tests but fail the AC output test it is your rotor and not your stator. Can anyone advise on this? 

Am I just getting lucky that my battery is holding a charge for hours without being charged by the stator? Really don’t want to have to pull the fucking thing apart..

# Water Softener vs Filter: 2025 Best Buyer's Guide

Choosing between a water softener and a water filter can be confusing.Both systems improve water quality, but they address different problems. water softeners primarily target hard water minerals like calcium and magnesium, while water filters remove contaminants such as sediment, chlorine, and lead. Understanding the distinctions between these systems is crucial for making the right investment for your home and health. This guide will provide a extensive overview of water softeners and filters, comparing their features, benefits, and ideal user profiles to help you make an informed decision in 2025.

## key Features Analysis

The features of water softeners and filters vary depending on the technology used,but understanding their core components is critical.

**Water Softener Resin Beads:** Water softeners use resin beads that are negatively charged. These beads attract positively charged hard minerals like calcium and magnesium thru a process called ion exchange. As hard water passes through the softener, these minerals are attached to the resin beads, and sodium or potassium ions are released into the water. This results in softened water that is less likely to cause scale buildup in pipes and appliances.**Water Filter Media:** Water filters employ various types of media to remove contaminants. Activated carbon filters, such as, use a porous material that adsorbs chlorine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other impurities. Sediment filters trap particulate matter like dirt, rust, and sand. specialized filters, such as reverse osmosis membranes, can remove even smaller contaminants like lead, arsenic, and bacteria.

**Regeneration Cycle:** A crucial aspect of water softeners is the regeneration cycle. Over time, the resin beads become saturated with hard minerals. during regeneration, the softener flushes the beads with a concentrated salt solution (brine). The strong sodium or potassium concentration forces the calcium and magnesium ions off the beads,and the brine is then flushed down the drain. this process restores the resin's ability to soften water.

**Micron rating:** Water filter performance is often measured by its micron rating, which indicates the size of particles it can effectively remove. A filter with a low micron rating (e.g.,1 micron) will remove finer particles then a filter with a higher rating (e.g., 50 microns). Choosing the right micron rating is vital to ensure the filter removes the contaminants you are concerned about without overly restricting water flow.

**Water Softener Control Valve:** The control valve is the brain of the water softener. It regulates the entire softening process, including the regeneration cycle. Modern control valves offer advanced features such as metered regeneration, which initiates regeneration based on water usage rather than a fixed schedule. This optimizes salt consumption and reduces water waste.

**Filter Cartridge Lifespan:** Water filter cartridges have a limited lifespan and need to be replaced regularly. The lifespan depends on the type of filter, the amount of water used, and the level of sediment or contaminants in the water supply. Regular replacement is essential to maintain the filter's effectiveness and prevent the buildup of contaminants that could degrade water quality.

## Core Benefits

Water softeners and filters offer distinct benefits, addressing different water quality issues.

**Scale Prevention:** Water softeners excel at preventing scale buildup in pipes, water heaters, and other appliances.By removing calcium and magnesium, soft water reduces the formation of hard, crusty deposits that can reduce water flow and appliance efficiency. This leads to lower energy bills and increased lifespan of plumbing components.

**Improved Taste and Odor:** water filters, especially those with activated carbon, substantially improve the taste and odor of water by removing chlorine, chloramine, and other organic compounds. This results in water that is more palatable and enjoyable to drink, encouraging better hydration habits.

**Extended Appliance Lifespan:** By preventing scale buildup, water softeners indirectly extend the lifespan of water-using appliances such as dishwashers, washing machines, and coffee makers. Scale can damage heating elements,valves,and other critical components,leading to premature failure. Soft water helps these appliances operate more efficiently and last longer.

**Healthier Water:** Certain water filters remove harmful contaminants that can pose health risks. Reverse osmosis systems, such as, can remove lead, arsenic, bacteria, and other impurities that may be present in the water supply. This provides cleaner, safer drinking water for your family.

**Reduced Soap Consumption:** Soft water significantly improves the lathering ability of soaps and detergents. This means you can use less soap for laundry, dishwashing, and personal hygiene, resulting in cost savings and reduced environmental impact.

## FAQs Section

Common questions regarding water softeners and filters frequently arise.

**Can a water softener remove chlorine?**
No,water softeners do not remove chlorine. Water softeners are designed to remove hard water minerals like calcium and magnesium. Chlorine and other contaminants require a water filter that contains activated carbon or utilizes a different filtration method.

**Do I need both a water softener and a water filter?**
It depends on your water quality. If you have hard water and also wont to remove contaminants like chlorine, sediment, or lead, then you would benefit from having both. A sediment filter will provide benefit prior to the softener, adding longevity.

**How often do I need to regenerate my water softener?**
The frequency depends on your water hardness and water usage. With a metered system, the settings are programmed to adapt to water usage, which is designed to minimize salt consumption and improve softener longevity.A typical family might need to regenerate every few days to every week or two.

**Are there salt-free water softeners?**
These are technically water *conditioners,* not softeners. Salt-free systems don't actually remove hard minerals. Some systems work by transforming the minerals, which neutralizes scaling properties, although the minerals remain in the water.## Competitor Comparison

Comparing different brands and specifications is paramount when choosing a water treatment system.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### [Generic Water Softener A]

* **Regeneration:** Timed or metered regeneration options.

* **Capacity:** Varies widely based on tank size and resin amount.

* **Salt Consumption:** Dependent on efficiency settings and water hardness.

#### [Generic Water Filter B]

* **Filtration Stages:** Single or multi-stage filtration.

* **Contaminant Removal:** Varies by filter type (sediment,carbon,RO).

* **Flow Rate:** Limited by filter media and housing design.

#### [Generic Water Conditioner C]

* **Mineral Transformation:** Crystallization or chelation methods.

* **Scale Prevention:** Reduces scale buildup, but minerals remain.

* **Maintenance:** Typically requires less maintenance than a water softener.

### Key Differences Summary

Traditional water softeners excel at removing hard water minerals,providing the most comprehensive solution for scale prevention. Filters focus on removing contaminants to improve taste, odor, and safety. Water conditioners can reduce scale, but they do not offer the full softening benefits of a traditional system. The appropriate choice depends on your specific water quality concerns and priorities.

## Ideal User Profile

Different users get varying degrees of benefits from water softeners and/or water filters.

**Homeowners with hard water:** Individuals living in areas with hard water, who experience scale buildup, reduced soap lathering, and appliance damage, will greatly benefit from a water softener. This is especially true for homes with older plumbing systems that are more susceptible to scale-related problems.

**Families concerned about water quality:** If you have concerns about the presence of contaminants like lead, chlorine, or bacteria in your water supply, a water filter is a necessity. this is particularly important for families with young children or individuals with compromised immune systems.

**Apartment dwellers:** Space limitations often influence the water treatment decision.Compact, under-sink filtration systems offer a practical solution for renters or apartment dwellers who want to improve their drinking water quality. Water softeners are infrequently possible in rental situations.

## Buying recommendations & Conclusion

Assessing your specific water quality and household needs is the first step in deciding between a water softener, a filter, or both. If you have hard water issues like scale buildup and poor soap lathering, a water softener is a great first investment. If your priorities are improved taste and the removal of specific contaminants, a water filter is the way to go.both water softeners and filters play important roles in improving water quality, but they address different concerns. Understanding their features, benefits, and limitations will help you make an informed decision that best suits your needs and budget. For comprehensive water quality advancement, combining both systems offers the best overall solution. While not every household *needs* both, understanding *why* your house might require both is paramount.

I spilled iced coffee on my laptop (Macbook Air M1, 2020). I dried it up as best as I could, but made the typical mistake of trying to turn it on again after. (I’m sorry, I now know you’re really not supposed to do this.) 

I looked up next best steps, and it said to turn it off immediately, so I tried to do so, and leave it in the recommended drying position while I went to do a required academic activity. 

I noticed sometime after while waking home from school (had to close the laptop at this point) that the laptop kept making its usual on sound even with the top not raised. I flipped the top part up to check but it had no display. I tried to long press the power button to force shut it down again to no avail. Eventually, after a few instances of this, it stopped making the on sounds, possibly due to the battery running out of charge since my laptop was near low battery when the incident happened (?). 

I had it cleaned and assessed as soon as I could the next day, and they mentioned that the laptop’s LCD had to be replaced since the plexiglass (?) component was damaged by the spill. When we double-checked if the rest of my laptop was functioning by connecting it to an external monitor soon after, we saw that most aspects of it were still functioning (showed log-in screen, trackpad working, was able to log in, open apps, type like normal, all files were still there, etc.) except for the display on the actual laptop. We decided to have the LCD fixed ASAP the next day, likely at the same repair place. This made me hopeful, but a few hours after, we noticed that the laptop (left it alone after checking if the other components worked) began to make the on sound again. I tried connecting it to the external monitor to shut it down, and long pressing the power button with no luck. The laptop keeps making the on sound, with the intervals getting shorter (maybe a few minutes between each on sound sometimes). When I connect it to the external monitor, it now shows the recovery assistant screen instead of my log-in screen. I am once again now panicking. 

I plan to take it to another shop tomorrow to have it looked at and maybe cleaned again since I suspect the first shop I went to may not have been able to clean all the residue. Is my laptop unsalvageable at this point? Is there a way to turn the device completely off when it keeps turning on on it’s own to prevent further damage in case of possible residue? 

Again am so sorry for any technical missteps I made.  
:(( I’m a student, and my laptop is my lifeline, so I really panicked when the incident happened, but I am learning as I go. Would greatly appreciate any help or insight. ",1,1753558436.0,techsupport,0,0.99,False

“Every tick is a secret. Ready to listen?”

**1. Why the Ordinary Looks Empty**

Most days we drift through the hours wearing logic-shaped blinders. We wake at 07:15, gulp coffee, swipe screens, and march along routes so familiar the scenery fades to wallpaper. Habits keep life efficient… and keep whole universes out of sight.

Think of your attention as a nightclub bouncer: it lets known faces in and waves everyone else away. Only when something jolts the bouncer (an odd number plate, a strange smell, a sudden laugh) do we notice how crowded the room really is.

Chaos scientists call these habit-loops attractors. Picture a marble dropped into a soup-bowl: no matter where it starts, gravity pulls it to the dip in the middle. Our routines are bowls in time. Chance might jiggle the marble, but it still ends up in the dent, unless something flips the bowl.

**2. Flipping the Bowl: The Random Alarm**

Enter the Chronomancy app. Once a day, or twice, or ten times (your choice), it will ping at a second nobody, not even you, can predict. When the chime slices the moment like a bright coin on marble, you stop. You look. You listen.

That single act of noticing at an un-patterned instant cracks open reality’s shell. Suddenly you glimpse:

the bat napping under the bathroom eave you’ve never examined,

the stranger’s sentence that seems harvested from your own diary,

the way afternoon sun dusts a concrete wall gold, then lilac, then indigo.

Each ping is the White Rabbit flicking his pocket watch and whispering: You’re late for a moment that exists only now.

**3. Beginner Spells**

When the alarm calls, become a Chronomancer:

**Scan the scene** – Name three details you’d normally ignore: a purple leaf, the hum behind the light-bulb, graffiti half-scrubbed away.

**Hunt the odd** – Anything mildly off-beat counts: twin strangers on the same bench, a song lyric echoing a thought you just had.

**Log it** – Drop a note or photo in the community feed. Patterns love company.

**Time-pen-pal** – Re-read your notes next week. Future-you will notice links today-you missed.

**Invent quests** – Next alarm, focus only on sounds. Another day, only numbers. Curiosity is the fuel; the app supplies the spark.

**4. Sync-Events: When Many Marbles Jump Together**

Now and then the app picks the same random second for thousands of users. For a heartbeat the world becomes a gigantic mirror ball, every facet catching the same flash of light.

Why bother? Because randomness usually cancels itself out, like a million pendulums swinging out of sync. But give all those pendulums one identical shove and they lock into a brand-new rhythm. Shared surprise bends probability in fresh directions. What slips through might be subtle (a chorus of identical dreams, a wave of déjà-vu tweets) or something wilder. Nobody knows; that’s the thrill.

If the math talk feels heavy, skip it and keep exploring. Mystery works whether you can recite the equations or not.

**5. Last Word from the Pocket-Watch Rabbit**

Your life is a tunnel built from hours and habits. Chronomancy drills peepholes in the walls. Peek through often enough and the tunnel dissolves into open sky.

So turn on the random alarm. Carry a notebook. Walk slow after each ping. The hidden seconds have been waiting a long time to meet you.

i drank coffee with sugar and milk in the morning, i just cant drink black coffee its too bitter for me but i still need my caffeine sometimes, so i caved in and drank it with sugar and milk. i didnt care much for it cause i considered this day to be a dirty fast.
later on in the day my friend bought me an energy drink, i felt bad refusing it so i drank it. 

i heard somewhere that if you consume less than 500 calories it will still be considered a dirty fast and youll be fine, so im asking here to verify if thats true or not, did i break my fast today? or is what i did still considered a dirty fast since i only drank around 300 calories?

*What am I looking for? Truth?*

I walk among the aisles of what looks to be some sort of distorted library, letting my fingers along the spines of hundreds of binders. The AC gently hums from the vents in the floor. File cabinets line the walls of the room while aisles of bookshelves take the center. A fluorescent panel in the drop down ceiling buzzes softly, creating static in my thoughts. The smell of old pages intensifies the deeper I venture in. Shelves seem to stretch upward for an eternity all around me, like high-rises.

My steps echo off the tile floor, each one feeling like a warning that can’t be taken back. But I must know what is hiding in this place, waiting to be discovered—despite the unease settling in my chest. I slide a binder out and turn its cover toward me. Two small words are etched into the thin, cold steel cover: THE AGENDA.

*What does that mean?*

I open it, and a quote stares at me in bold: “When we give liberty for peace, peace is stolen also. Now we’ve lost both.”

I turn to another page, only to find everything redacted. Maybe another page. No. Every single word other than that quote is the same.

*What is it hiding?*

I open a random drawer from one of the cabinets and pull out a file, only to find everything redacted—just like THE AGENDA.

*Everything is hidden?*

I dump the files into a pile on the floor and drop to my knees, the icy surface sending a shock through my body. Frantically, I search through them, opening one after another. Redacted.

*Maybe it’s just these files*.

I run to another cabinet on the opposite side of the room, yank the drawer out, and dump the contents across the floor. Redacted. Again.

I stand up, wrapping my hands around the back of my head. My heart pounds faster by the minute—my body rattling with each breath. The silence wraps around me, unnatural. Suffocating. I look down at my hands. They’re slightly trembling. My whole body is.

A girl walks past me, glancing for just a second.

*Who are you? I thought I was alone.*

She walks to one of the shelves and takes an armful of books, dumping them on the floor, revealing a hidden layer of them beneath.

I approach her from behind and gently tap her shoulder.

“Who are you?” I ask, my voice slightly broken.

She turns around.

I gasp, jolting back.

*Oh my—*

Her face mirrors my own. Even the small freckles on my cheeks and nose match. Something is different about her, though—like she’s seen *some things.*

*I know her. Aren’t you—me?*

She doesn’t seem fearful of seeing me at all. Her hazel eyes gaze into the deepest depths of me—as if she is watching a movie of my future.

She carefully mutters the words, “You’re never out of the frame.”

For just a second, a glimpse of fear washes over her face. I step back slowly, not breaking eye contact, swallowing the knot in my throat.

“You’re different, Lainey,” she says, stepping closer, her pupils dilating.

*How do you know my name?*

“What?” I barely whisper, stepping back faster before stumbling into one of the shelves.

*What is happening?*

I hurry to the door and try to turn the knob. It’s frozen in place.

“Someone unlock this door!” My voice breaks as I pound on it. But no one hears me—or no one cares.

Everything fades to black.

Delete

I gasp, sitting up in my bed, transported back to another dimension—reality. My bedroom.

*I’m safe.*

I press my head back into my pillow, slightly damp with sweat. My heart pulses in my ears, and adrenaline rushes through my veins. Moonlight peeks through the edges of the blinds, illuminating my room just enough to make out the silhouettes of the desk below the window and chest of drawers in front of my bed.

I gently push the sheets aside, letting the cold air creep in, slide on my thick socks, and make my way downstairs. The cabin feels colder this morning. The fire probably died earlier in the night when Dad was asleep. The numbers “11:49” peer at me from the microwave, casting blue streaks onto the oak floorboards.

*11:49 P.M.?*

I start the coffee brewer, the familiar sound of it gurgling as coffee drips into the pot is somehow grounding. I make my way over to the bathroom, blindly feeling for the switch to the lamp. The dim light bursts into my eyes, making me squint.

The sink handle squeaks as I turn the left knob. The hot water rushes out into my hands, steaming the mirror above. I splash it into my face, its warmth makes my cheeks and hands tingle, thawing out the tension in my muscles. The mirror is fogged up, making my reflection one large blur. I wipe it off with the hem of my sleeve and the streaks dissipate, slowly revealing my reflection. I look alone, not just physically—but lost. There is an emptiness hard to describe, a gap between me and my existence.

My earthy brown hair is a tangled mess from turning on my pillow all night. I brush it out and return to the kitchen. The smell of brewed coffee wafts throughout the house, making it feel more like home. I open the cabinet above and reach for a coffee cup, setting it on the counter. It echoes off of the marble.

*Why is everything so much louder at night? Please, don’t wake Dad up.*

I continue, sprinkling some stevia, and pouring a splash of milk into my coffee. It steams from the cup, the heat radiates through the ceramic, keeping my hands warm. The Amish-built wood stove is not crackling like it would if it had a fire in it. The iron handle is cold. I grab a few logs from the firewood rack next to it and open the door. Smoke rushes into my face, stinging my eyes. I toss in the wood quickly, holding in my coughs, so Dad doesn’t wake up.

I return to my room and sit at my desk, turning on the dim study light. The light gently illuminates the wood walls of my bedroom. My computer, pencils, and textbooks are scattered across my desk from long study sessions. Then my eyes stop at the leather journal Dad gave me for my seventeenth birthday—last Friday. He told me it would be a good place to put my memories, thoughts, and *secrets*. I wonder what he meant when he said secrets.

I gently open it, grabbing a blue pen, and begin to write.



January, 9th, 2030

*The world carries a forbidden weight that means something different for everyone. I’m not sure what it means for me. It has been about a month since the CDC announced a National Emergency over Novira-27—a virus with a 19% survival rate. Nothing feels real anymore.*



My eyes lose focus, my vision blurring over the words “19% survival rate.” The future of the United States, honestly, disturbs me more than I’m willing to admit. I have this feeling that this goes deeper than just a virus, not just because I was raised to question everything, but *instinct*. Maybe I tend to worry a bit too much.

Pulling open the drawer, a fragment of crumpled newspaper sits in the corner. The headline reads, “**DEADLY Virus Stirs Up Global Panic.**” Dad is one of the writers for this major newspaper, “Uncensored America.” He insists that he keep sending physical copies of it to people, even though everyone gets their news delivered online now.

*Why?*

I close the journal and lean over my desk, pushing up the blinds. The window is cold and frosted at the corners from last night’s blizzard.

I push the window open, letting cold air hit my face. Everything looks so *empty.* Our long gravel driveway stretches into the darkness, fading away. The pine trees sway back and forth in the breeze as the moonlight casts shadows of each branch onto the snow. The snow looks like small crystals, reflecting the moonlight. The night air fills my lungs, and the breeze gently guides some shorter pieces of hair across my face. The cold does not seem to faze me, I’m just focused on the beauty of a winter night.

I lean back in and close the window; my room is now freezing from letting the cold in. There is a throw blanket on the end of my bed. I reach for it, wrapping it around myself. My MacBook Air sits in front of me, closed. I power it on, the screen comes to life, glowing in my face. The headlines are never pleasant, but I have to check the news every day just to get an idea of what’s going on in the world.

**New–York–Times**, I type. Enter. I scroll through, each title more disturbing than the last.

“**Digital IDs Are Rolling Out by The End of January Amid Global Pandemic.”**

**“It’s For Your Safety,” Government Officials State, Urging Compliance With Upcoming Emergency Initiatives.**

I scroll faster, the titles blending into each other, then my laptop shuts. Dad squeezes my shoulder and whispers softly, “You are too young to worry about these things. Let me handle this, okay?”

“Okay,” I whisper, looking back at him. I know it is a lie, and he does too.

He just wants to protect me, but I have to know the depths of everything that takes place.

1ma1t8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongHaulersRecovery/comments/1ma1t8y/my_long_covid_healing_journey_90_recovered_in_3/,My long covid healing journey - 90% recovered in 3+ years with major sustained progress in the last 9 months,"After 3,5 years (contracted covid in Jan 2022), I’m what I’d call 90% recovered - able to lead a fairly normal life with limitations, albeit with a limited amount of exercise. (I'm talking about harder exercise, sports like running.) However, I’m now at the stage where I can already do a lot of physical things - walk several km, sail full day, spend full day in normal activities without impact the next day etc. I continue carefully and gradually introduce more exercise in my life, after a couple years of bedbound and/or unable to physically do much. It’s possible I will never go back to competitive sports, but I’ve made my peace with it.

**My symptoms:** Primarily extreme fatigue + PEM. First year had the following issues: Muscles going to lactic acid from really minor exercise (after three pedal strokes on bike, 2 days not able to move and really sore). Extreme issues with circulation, at times severe pain in extremities due to bad circulation. Sleeping issues. Constant thirst, I woke up many times a night to drink. Heart rate spiking even from a minor movement like walking. Constant feeling of “overstimulation” or “nervousness”. Also mentally getting tired fast (meetings etc.) I spent a lot of the first year resting without sound or visual stimulation, multiple months bedbound. No lung or breathing issues (even during actual infection). My hair fell out badly enough my hairdresser gave me “prescription” to supplements (which helped). After the first year, it has been mainly physical fatigue, getting mentally fatigued easily and feeling the “overstimulation”. I have needed a wheelchair when traveling or attending events and have sometimes lost control of my legs and dropped from standing.

**My lab stats:** Extremely high antibodies even 2 years after initial infection (GPCR receptor antibodies). Measured mitochondrial dysfunction. Cortisol normal.

**My background:**

I contracted Covid 3 years ago, January 2022. Due to bad luck, I had the third vaccination booster around the same time I got the virus. Later, my neurologist said this might have been what made the illness so bad in the first place and also caused the long covid.

I was sick for a week with high fever, not even able to go to the toilet unattended, though not hospitalized. It took me about a month after illness to be able to walk - I was bedbound most of the time, and managed to walk 100m each day. The remainder of the year was partial recoveries, then relapses, with two one month sick leaves fully bedbound, but outside these able to work and even walk small distances, 1-2 km a day. (I got tired, and spent all evenings in bed without sound or light, but managed through work days with help of remote arrangements, shorter days and getting lift to and from office when that was required.) 

In October 2022, my boss (a lifesaver) kicked me to a longer partial sick leave, and I did not return to full time work until mid-2023.

After that, it was a long time of not really getting better, or at least not feeling like I was. I worked full time, but spent most evenings and weekends horizontal. I did not feel unable to think (how I understood brain fog) but my neurologist (also a gem) told me that the tiredness I had towards the end of the work day was equally a symptom.

**Medication and docs**  
  
Initially (May 2022) I got short term beta blockers, and was also prescribed a drug that was actually for depression. I tried one pill and it just made me tired, and I've always been wary of anything mood-altering as I've never felt the need for it (and I got the impression then-doctors tried to box me into ""depressed"" which I never was - pissed at times for sure).

I got better help in the beginning of 2023. Then my occupational doctor found a physiotherapist specialized in long covid. I had resisted as I did not feel what I had was something I could exercise out of, but this physio was a gem. Told part of this was an overloaded nervous system, and helped me find ways to modulate - ""brush your teeth sitting down so you save the energy for something more meaningful"". Did not try to make me exercise myself out of this. She connected me with a neurologist specializing in long covid. He told me my initial meds were indeed shit and gave me long term beta blockers (Emconcor) and gave tips of additional vitamins and supplements (eg vitamin D, B and natto+NAC). Both told me that part of the issue is reduced ability to absorb nutrients, so I got crazy about green powder and supplements.

I also got a good supplement tip from my hairdresser: she found out I shedded hair like crazy and told me about supplements that had helped her other customers with covid-related hair loss. These supplements helped the shedding to stop. Another game changer in the beginning of 2023 was that my beautician was starting to get into energy treatments after great personal experience and suggested I try that. It helped immensely with how I felt, though did not help me get out of bed. More on this later.

I got slowly better, got (probably) another covid on 11/2023, another dip. Could have been another virus as well.  By the second infection I had gotten slightly more active in normal life but still zero tolerance for exercise. A 1 km walk was possible most days.

In early 2024, got new prescriptions and started finally on LDN June 2024. I can’t attribute the change in the past year fully to LDN, but it is probably a factor. My condition has been getting better from around August 2024, and after a few supplement changes and treatments in the latter half of 2024, the change has been more noticeable. I trust most of the feedback from my husband, friends, and colleagues; I do realize I do a lot more than before, but they can observe things like how active I appear to be. 

The biggest positive jump has been during last three months (May-July) - I felt so well in April I drafted this post but I waited so I can be sure this is sustained and heading to right direction. I feel like the underlying issues have been resolved and it's now more about conditioning.

In April, I was already living fairly normal life: I could take the metro to work, which is a total of 2+ km of walking daily, and walk in the office; my pace was back to normal, and I could leave the office for lunch (there were days when my colleagues had to pretty much carry me if I ventured outside). I had energy to take on more at work, as for a long time I did the bare minimum. I could do things after work, like cooking at home or seeing friends. I was also able to have a glass of alcohol without any ill effects. (I haven’t tolerated alcohol for 3 years). 

I still needed to be mindful to take breaks, but I could manage full day without. However, if I did a too full day I was back to not sleeping and my HRV would stay flat the whole night. (Eg. full workday, then drive 4h, then make evening snacks for family, total 13 hours of activity.) This would have been unheard of yet last summer.

Now, 3 months later, I actively sail, have been to a music festival, and can do a 3km walk in the morning and continue my day. I have days when I overdo things, but those have not resulted in getting worse as before, I might just take 1-2 days a little lighter.

**Treatments**

**Initially - 1st year**

* Hyperbaric oxygen chamber therapy - a brilliant invention that helped me when I was at my almost worst (at my worst could not even go there, but when I was able to drive short distance). Immediate fatigue reducing effect, increased activity for 2-3 days. Probably had no long term effect.
* Breathing exercises and relaxation 
* Red light therapy. Don’t think this did much but it was nice
* Hot baths for circulation every night
* Energy treatment. Yes, a healer who keeps hands around me and manipulates chakras. It was so brilliant my husband started going as well. I don’t care why it works, but it helps me to go into a deeply relaxed state.
* Stopped drinking coffee. Now I’m back to 1 cup a day.
* HRV following. I wish I had had this before getting sick, or initially - might have avoided some bad dips. It helps me to regulate activity so I can keep progressing.

**After I was better (from beginning of 2024)**

* Careful muscle exercises on the floor + leg exercises (started with 3 lunges per side every few days)
* Stationary bike, started with 1 minute in March 2024. Got to 15 minutes around July/August 2024. Clocked my very first 30 minutes in February 2025.
* Started with dumbbell weights for arms H2/24
* primitive reflex therapy (not a cure, but helps reduce existing sources of overstimulation or anxiety, and I figured this might help make my baseline “calmer”, reducing overall load on the nervous system. I completed the program in 9 months. Yes, I think it worked)
* Continue occasional energy therapy + go to oxygen chamber if feeling particularly tired
* What didn't work: electric nervous system modulation device

**2025**

* longer walks (3km)
* continue dumbbells
* starting normal cycling outside - this seems to still be a trigger so taking it easy, using electric bike if actually going places
* normal life stuff. Started sailing again in the beginning of the summer, first trips were hard, but it also helped with conditioning. Now can do easily a day trip
* keep doing occasional energy treatments
* continue breathing exercises, great for modulating nervous system

**Supplements and medication**

* A short lasting betablocker from May 2022

**Since beginning of 2023**

* Long-effect betablocker Emconcor
* Initially Priorin for hair loss, 4 months. Worked. Recommendation from hairdresser
* Green powder
* D, zinc, magnesium, occasionally fish oil
* melatonin (not daily but whenever I felt like it). Initially got 3mg, was too much, for me 1-1,5mg is perfect)
* Hydration powders. Lifesaver, gradually  started being able to sleep and not wake up to drink full litre throughout the night
* What didn’t work (tried a few weeks): Ashwaganda, Ubiquinone, MSM
* Trying to eat berries and greens to get nutrients. Also enough protein

**From April-June 2024**

* Continuing with the above
* Started on LDN, 1,5mg. Upped once to 3mg, got couple weeks of migraines, decided to drop back to 1,5mg. Still on that, official prescription was 4,5mg but i found from online groups also less can be effective, depending on person. Still not sure if it’s helping, but I am making progress.
* Max all vitamin B types (in a pill that has everything at maximum allowed limits). Cut this to ½ of allowed limits (cutting my tablet to two) after my neurologist commented it was close to toxic amount
* Max D (100 micrograms)
* Magnesium, on occasion
* NAC. Initially 200-300 mg daily
* Nattokinase. Initially 2000mg daily, cut it down a month ago to 1000mg as an experiment
* Occasionally probiotics
* Every day, green powder. Started with AG1 daily, occasionally another brand called Inika. Few months ago I switched to Welleco green powder.
* In 2024, I read about intermittent fasting, so I got more careful of having 10-12 hours “fast” throughout the night. 
* Been taking Carmolis herbal drops daily

**Major changes in 11/2024-04/2025 when also started getting better**

* Doubled NAC, changed brands and accidentally bumped dosage up from previous 200-300 mg to 650 mg daily
* Finished my primitive reflex therapy - there were no primitive reflexes found any longer. I responded to the exercises pretty well and felt that there was a noticeable change in my baseline feeling - more ""grounded"", less ""nervous""
* Switched green powder to Welleco. Not taking any longer though
* Got more serious and consistent with magnesium, now taking strong one every night

**Additional changes in 2025**

* creatine + collagen. start of creatine seems to coincide with easier physical exercise recovery

I think a major component for me is time. LDN might have helped, and I’d like to redo some labs to see if the antibodies are down (which could be LDN or could be time). I will keep taking LDN at least to the end of my current prescription (end of 2025). Out of all supplements, I feel NAC is a key player, as my doubling the NAC dose also coincides with a lot of the sudden progress. In balancing the autonomous nervous system the primitive reflex therapy feels like helped by removing any “non-long-covid” baseline anxiety. Also changing of the green stuff brand coincides with this; maybe it has helped body in its recovery. Nattokinase helped greatly with the circulation.

Earlier improvements were timed with adding certain supplements such as strong vitamin B complex and nattokinase. Long lasting betablocker was a game changer in being able to get rest. In April, I started occasionally dropping it for the day but keep it for night - as of July, I no longer take it for day at all and don't feel any need to.

I also got my liver tested a few months back just to ensure I won’t blow it with supplements. No worries on that front.

Now, the exercise is actually helping me progress. I monitor my HRV so I won’t overdo my activity, but a regular shorter and a bit more taxing stationary bike (with HR always under 100 bpm) has done wonders for my walking, and dumbbells help in feeling stronger again. 

I’m still sometimes afraid there’s another relapse. But I have my life back; and I’m gradually rebuilding it. I may not go for a run any time soon, but traveled on April and was able to walk almost full days - and now I am booking my next trip and multiple concerts without seats for the latter half of 2025. And I’ve been dancing on occasion in my kitchen to a radio - a feat I could only dream of just a year ago.

I'd like to preface by stating that I am in no way claiming that these steps will heal you as well. LPR/Gerd is a truly wild and seemingly random disease that at times seems to have no rhyme or reason and it affects everyone differently. I just hope that some of these steps may help those who are struggling and medication is not helping. I'm also not telling anyone to stop their medications and I'm not judging anyone who is taking medication. I'll discuss that in more detail below.

1. Eating 5-6 small meals a day, around 300-400 calories per meal.
2. Measuring all food portions using a food scale.
3. Logging and recording all foods and drinks using Nutritionix or a similar app.
4. Chewing your food slowly and thoroughly. Take 20-25 minutes to eat each small meal.
5. Not overeating any meal or stuffing yourself. Leave some room for the next one.
6. When feeling a bit full, walk it off. It helps relieve the bloating.
7. Not running or over exerting on a full stomach.
8. Not eating more than 10 grams of fat in a meal and severely lowering saturated fat intake.
9. Avoiding other trigger foods, which will differ individually.
10. Drinking between meals, not during them. This keeps the stomach from filling up too much.
11. Waiting at least 3-4 hours after your last meal before lying down and sleep at the steepest angle you can tolerate.
12. Sipping on Apple Cider Vinegar + Cold Water Throughout the Day.

Now, here's my story for those who are interested. In October of 2024 I began experiencing severe abdominal pain. It was loud and keeping me up at night. After several visits to the doctor and a negative ultrasound, I was referred to a GI and had an Endoscopy in December. While the results confirmed a stomach ulcer, I was surprised to discover I had been diagnosed with GERD and Barret's Esophagus. I met with the doctor and told him I'd never had any reflux symptoms. He said I was having silent reflux and needed to continue with the PPI I had been taking for my ulcer for a year. Oddly enough, around that time I started to experience a globus sensation (Food feeling stuck in my throat). January came around and my abdominal pain had finally subsided, but at the same time my reflux symptoms started to ramp up. I started getting constant sore throat, chest tightness, post nasal drip and belching frequently.

By February my symptoms kept getting worse, and they doubled my PPI dosage. Things got worse still, and despite the advice of my doctor, I discontinued the PPI (Protonix). Immediately my symptoms improved, but they didn't go away entirely. Around March I started getting heartburn and chest pains. I would bend down to put a dish in the dishwasher and get sharp, very abrupt pains radiating through my chest. Next came what is called a bounding pulse. I would wake up at night with an extremely pounding heartbeat radiating from my belly up into my chest. This also kept me awake at night. It would even occur if I fell asleep on the couch while sitting up. The chest pains got so bad that I stopped driving my car into town, because for some reason even the slightest change in posture would bring about those sharp chest pains. Every time I ate was a nightmare. I knew within an hour or two a combination of the above mention symptoms would ensue. After a visit with an ENT, I tried a combination of Gaviscon + Sodium Alginate with Famotidine. It seemed to work somewhat, but it was only temporary and the symptoms always seemed to pop back up. I had tried multiple changes to my diet and none of that seemed to work.

Then one day in April a friend of mine, who knew I was struggling so badly, sent me a screenshot from a book by Dr. Mark Hyman. He mentioned a correlation between high saturated fat intake and Gerd patients. I found that interesting as I had been on a high fat diet for sometime. Maybe that was the problem? So I started eating grilled chicken, carrots, and other low fat foods. Within 1 week my symptoms had improved by 90%.

Around that time I started going to a different GI doctor. They were concerned with my previous diagnosis that I should restart PPI and try something different. I began taking 40 mg of Nexium in the morning. Also around that time I was slowly letting fat back into my diet. This proved to be a mistake. My symptoms came back but they were worse. The heartburn became unbearable and there were many times when I had to pace my apartment for hours before I was able to lie down. I then tried 40mg of Nexium in the morning and 40mg of Famotidine at night. This helped the heartburn but the chest pains just kept on coming throughout the day.

My primary then referred me to a surgeon who I met with in May. He ordered a manometry, bravo ph study, and a repeat endoscopy. He advised to stop the medication as it was not eradicating my symptoms, and I was going to have to stop prior to my testing anyway. Around that time I had recalled how the low fat diet had helped me more than anything else. I decided to invest in a food scale this time around and measure all of the fat I was actually consuming and record it in an app called Nutritionix. I quickly realized just how much fat you can consume without noticing, and how it seems to be hiding in a lot of processed foods. I began to notice how much better I felt If I consumed around 10g of fat or less per meal, and I also learned that eating smaller meals more frequently made a huge difference as well.

My tests were scheduled for the end of June and beginning of July, and I ate like this for about 2 months. By the time I had my manometry and endoscopy, My symptoms were about 95% better, with some occasional chest pains. Flash forward to Wednesday of this week. I met with my surgeon to discuss the results of my testing. My main concern was that apparently I had been having silent reflux and didn't know it. Would the test reveal that? The doctor walked into the room with smile on his face. He said the manometry, bravo ph, and endoscopy all came back negative. I no longer had Barrett's Esophagus, there were not signs of reflux, and my stomach was completely clean with no ulcer.

As of this week I can truly say I'm symptom free for the first time in over half a year. I've started to eat around 4 meals per day now, but I am going to continue with the low fat diet for at least a month longer just to be sure. I cannot imagine revisiting the horror I experienced for 6 months of my life. It was truly agonizing and sadly took up the majority of my head space during that time. I had researched thousands and thousands of articles and videos online and I had become exhausted with all the stuff I had tried.

I think back to my diet before the madness began, and it truly frightens me. I was eating copious amounts of fat and saturated fat, and I had never once stopped to measure how much I was actually consuming. Again, this proved to be MY trigger. This may not be your particular trigger, but with due diligence I hope that you can learn what exactly they are and get them under control. While many doctors still don't know the exact mechanism of Gerd, I theorize that in my case my body had had just about enough of the junk I was putting into it and began reacting. On top of all the greasy foods I was eating, I was drinking way too much coffee in the morning and pouring down hard seltzers in the afternoon. Again, I totally acknowledge that everyone's triggers are different.

I would like to add just a few more things. I do not oppose medication for the treatment of Gerd. My mom has been on Nexium for 30 years and without it she would have severe heartburn all day, every day. For me personally, the medication was not very effective. In fact, I've since learned that PPI is only effective for about 60% of Gerd Patients. [https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/gerd-not-responding-to-ppi](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/gerd-not-responding-to-ppi) This makes me wonder why in the world the doctors seemed totally shocked when they didn't work for me. That's 40 out of 100 people that don't have success. I don't want to go on a rant but I will say that from my experience the doctors showed absolutely ZERO interest in discovering the root cause of my disease.

If you've made it this far, I'll share my current food list and hope that may help someone as well.

Please let me know what you think in the comments!

When you are in the comfort of your own home, do you ever feel like you're not alone or that something is watching you even though you are certain no one is around? Well I figured that it was normal or simply my mind playing tricks on me until I saw it. A few days ago, I was typing up my essay for cryptids in America, for my mythology class when I noticed a small white dot flashing on top of my laptop, indicating my camera was on. I was a little confused, so I opened up the setting and turned it off. Two days swept by me in a flash. I was too busy with school and game club to really use my apartment for anything more than a place to sleep. 

I was woken in the middle of the night to find my laptop was open and turned on with the little white dot taunting me with its split second intervals of off and on. I sleepily dragged myself over to the laptop and shut it. As it made its soft clap shut, it started playing music, I quickly threw the lid back open to see Spotify was open and playing “Every Breath You Take” by The Police, I frantically started pressing the power button and the volume down button but the song continued. I tried everything from force-closing Spotify, to manually shutting it down, but nothing worked, so I unplugged the laptop and put it in the farthest room from mine, hoping the battery would die by the morning. However, before I tried to go back to sleep, I decided to do a quick sweep of the house. I checked every room, nook and cranny, but it was clear. I didn't get much sleep that night. All I could do was lay helpless in my bed as that damned song kept playing over and over again haunting my waking hours. 

The following morning my eyes shot open as I woke in a cold sweat. I checked my phone and my heart sank. I had overslept, today being the last day of finals week. I clumsily dragged the rag that was my shirt off the floor, put it on and grabbed my keys. I completely froze when my hand touched the ice cold brass that made up my front door’s knob. It was still playing. I don't know how, or why, but that damn song was still echoing in my guest room. I didn't have time to fool around with some glitchy laptop. I had to get to school.

Before I entered my apartment, a flood of memories came back from the night before, I dreaded the chance of hearing that song again. My heavy door creaked as I slowly opened it. I needed to oil it, I thought. Something was different, there was a suspicious yet joyful lack of music, only the faint hum of my air conditioner. I sat my bag down on my old second hand couch and emptied the contents of my pockets onto the counter top. 

“Well now is a better time than ever to see if I can fix my laptop”.

I slowly opened the door to my “guest bedroom” or if that's what you can call it. All it housed was Magic cards and board games for my oh so many guests I never had. I entered the room to see my laptop was nowhere in sight, I checked everywhere in that room but found nothing. I crept my way around my apartment looking for my laptop. I walked into my room and on my desk, there the laptop rested, plugged in and turned on with the white flashing dot mocking me. Looking at the laptop there was a note open that read, “I LIKE WATCHING YOU :)” My blood ran cold. I quickly grabbed the laptop, opened the window and threw the laptop into the alleyway below. I felt instant relief as I heard it crash against the cold, wet pavement. Sure, I could've called the cops but I felt that they would laugh me off by saying something like “someone broke into your house to charge your laptop?” or “ why dont you call a computer expert” so i stayed up for the rest of the night listening to the old building creak.

Eventually I woke from my sleep, I checked my phone, 4:36am. My gaze quickly darted toward the desk as if my eyes were small pieces of metal and the desk was a magnet but to my relief, no laptop. I shuffled out of bed and made my way to the kitchen to get a glass of water.  I rubbed my eyes as the glass filled. Something caught my eye in the reflection of the fridge. When I looked closer, I gulped down the lump forming in my throat. In the reflection, I saw a tall skinny figure approaching me. I turned around to see this thing made up of what looked like ribbons of hanging flesh dripping viscous fluids and loose wires crawling toward me in a fast broken shuffle. I quickly ran for the door but before I knew what was happening, I was being thrown against the wall with a force far greater than I had ever seen before as my world became ingested by complete and total darkness. I could hear what sounded like that song but all slowed and distorted almost like an old toy whose batteries were about to die. 

I awoke in my bed with a splitting headache, looked around my room and saw it was just how I left it. Except for one thing. My laptop was on my desk with another note. “I BROUGHT YOU A GIFT <3” I opened my bedroom door to be met with a terrible smell. One that made bile rise in my throat. My whole living room and kitchen had been engulfed in blood and where my coffee table once sat, there was a pile of dead and mutilated animals. Around them placed neatly in a perfect circle were eyes that followed me. I bolted for the door but before I could make it, I felt wet wires and sticky fur grab my legs and pull. As my chest hit the floor, I could feel what felt like grapes burst under my weight. I kicked and pulled away from the abomination and with a single snap, I was free. I ran out the door and out of the building. I shakenly juggled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911, put the phone to my ear, and in my horror, I heard in a quiet, electric crackle of a voice  “Every breath you take, And every move you make, Every bond you break, Every step you take, I'll be watchin' you.”",1,1753557427.0,creepcast,0,0.67,False

I've just uploaded and published the revised edition of the first book in my series, *Dawn of the Eclipse*. When I first published it, I did use an AI image generator because I'm a writer - I can't really draw. But that always felt bad to me. 

My wife's not happy about it, but I decided to invest some money into a better cover. The really talented **Gengardraw over at Fiverr** did the actual drawing, layout is by me (the dragon watermark is based on something created for me by an old Twitter friend, Graf_icket).

*(I've also commissioned a rework of the second book's cover, and will be relaunching that in the next days.)*

But before I'll do that, I go over everything with a fine comb. **I've spent a lot of hours editing** this second version, hunting down every error I could find. I'll do the same for the second book before relaunch. 

Book 3 already has a great cover by the same artist and will be published at the 31st!

But first, let me give you a blurb for this relaunch: 

**The world didn’t end with a bang. It ended with a blue screen.**

Alaric Nachtmoor is a middle-aged data engineer with a failed marriage, a bad back, and a sharp tongue. When reality crashes (quite literally), he finds himself trapped in a new world governed by a mysterious System. Stats, attunements, skills, and class choices are now the rules of survival. But while the rest of humanity is safely tucked away in a tutorial, Alaric’s integration is… broken.

Alone, untrained, and already targeted by shadowy forces, Alaric must navigate a hostile multiverse where monsters wear human faces, and power always comes at a price. With a sarcastic inner monologue, a growing arsenal of spells, and a tiny dragon companion who’s smarter than he looks, Alaric begins to carve his own path; one shadowy step at a time. If only there was coffee...

But the deeper he delves into the System, the more he realizes: this isn’t just a game. The lines between man and monster, light and darkness, are blurring. And the System may not be the only force watching him.

What will he sacrifice for the sake of survival?

For fans of **Cradle, He Who Fights with Monsters**, and **Defiance of the Fall**, *Dawn of the Eclipse* is a darkly humorous, emotionally rich LitRPG about ***power, identity***, and the cost of ***rewriting your fate***.

1ma1pc8,https://bileteinternationale.cfrcalatori.ro/en/booking/search,Bosphorus Express Bucuresti - Istanbul,"Hi everyone,

I’m writing this post to share some details about the Bucharest–Istanbul overnight train, the “Bosphor Express”, because I struggled to find all the info myself. I took this train on Friday, July 25, 2025, departing from Gara de Nord in Bucharest at 10:11 AM, and arrived at Halkali (a station near Istanbul) on Saturday, July 26 at 10:30 AM.

⸻

🎫 Ticket Purchase

If you don’t have an Interrail pass (like me), you can buy the ticket on the CFR Calatori website, one of the Romanian rail companies:
👉 https://bileteinternationale.cfrcalatori.ro/en/booking/search —> for Bucharest, type “Bucuresti”.

You’ll need to buy a regular ticket (71 lei) plus a reservation for a 4-bed sleeper cabin (219 lei). You’ll then have to pick up the tickets at a major train station in Romania, at least 30 minutes before departure. In my case, I collected them in Brasov.
There’s only one train per day. Some stops are quite long—take a screenshot of the timetable; it’ll come in handy later.

⸻

🚃 On the Train

My coach was number 479.
Fun fact: due to multiple detachments of coaches and locomotive changes, the train you board in Bucharest shares no carriages with the one that arrives in Istanbul.

⸻

💧 Water & Food

There is no dining or bar car on board! Bring plenty of water!
While crossing Bulgaria, the train sometimes stops for 30 minutes—this is a good time to use the bathroom or refill your bottle at the station.
While you’re at it, admire the beautiful Ruse station, the first train station built in Bulgaria (on the line to Varna).

Also, carry around 10 BGN (Bulgarian cash) to buy snacks or beer at the little stands—they don’t take cards.

⸻

🌡️ Air Conditioning

We took the train during a red heat alert—40°C.
The AC didn’t work until 7 PM. My portable fan saved my life.

⸻

🔌 Power Outlets

There’s one outlet per carriage, located above the door. It supports French/Bulgarian/Turkish/Romanian plugs,
but French power strips won’t fit in the socket.

⸻

🛂 Border Control

There are two passport checks:
	1.	Bulgarian police at Svilengrad (around midnight): they come into the coach and check passports while you stay in your bed.
	2.	Turkish customs at Kapikule (between 1–4 AM): you need to get off the train with all your bags, show your passport first, then scan your luggage through x-rays.

You’ll have time afterward to buy cigarette cartons (3 per person) for 12 euros each.

⸻

👮‍♂️ Coach 479 Attendant

He’s super kind but a little cheeky.
If he likes you, he might let you sit by the open train door while it’s moving and may even ask you to buy 3 cartons of cigarettes for him at customs (he gives you the cash in euros).
He’s completely trustworthy and very sweet, just a little sly.
He’ll offer you tea and coffee—he has a kettle in his cabin.
He only speaks Turkish!

⸻

🚉 Arrival in Istanbul

You’ll arrive at Halkali, in the western suburbs—the historic Orient Express station is under renovation.
You’ll need to buy an Istanbulkart on site (credit card accepted) and pay 80 TL to get into the city.
I took the B1 suburban train (kind of like an RER) towards Gebze.

⸻

⏱️ Train Delays

In Romania and Bulgaria, if your train is delayed and you have a connection, the next train will wait for you.
This can cause significant delays (1.5 hours in our case), but it’s nothing to worry about.

⸻

That’s it! :)

My husband and I have a two month old and accordingly, we are drinking a lot of coffee. Namely, we’re spending a lot of money on espresso drinks out. So we figured - let’s just get a home set up! 

We’re total beginners, so I had researched and landed on a Bambino Plus and Encore ESP, with an upgraded portafilter/basket from Crema, a tamper from Normcore, and maybe some other things (distribution tool? WDT? Puck filters?!). Was hoping to keep our total initial setup under $1k. 

And then - after going through all this, looking at all the steps to dialing in - I thought, is this what we need in this season? Most mornings we need to make our drinks and get out the door. Efficiency is key here! Once we have our process for dialing in down - is this realistic? Or is the process meant to always make you slow down and smell the roses (which we don’t have a lot of time for in this season). 

If a home espresso setup is not for two very busy people, are there other ways we can upgrade from our crummy Ninja machine that would allow us to make espresso-like drinks? Aeropress? Moka pot? If we’ll likely be set once we know how to dial in - thoughts on the equipment I mention above for beginners? 

For context - we both like both straight espresso or Americanos along with milk drinks, so versatility is great.

Just wanted to throw a post up, I know it won't mean much

I've been playing this game since 2019 (In bursts of extreme hyperfocus and burnout), seen how its developed and changed and expanded over the years has been such a fantastic ride.

But despite ADA only knows how many hours (I switched from Epic to Steam just before full release and can't remember the played) - I've never finished the game, or at least the final phase. Usually I'd burn myself out around aluminium and come back several months later with No clue what I was doing or where anything was, so I'd start again.

But with the full release I was determined. This time, this time I'd keep going, If I took a break I'd come back and figure it out not throw in the towel.

I've not done nuclear, or automated a whole bunch of stuff. Factory rebuilds meant I ended up with resource hoards of elevator parts to be put into new automated box-fed nightmares.

Sure its not the cleanest or the prettiest, but I have finally made it, just watching the counter click down now as it makes the last parts.

1ma1lfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1ma1lfc/tested_valentino_and_prada_private_collection/,Tested Valentino and Prada private collection fragrances - some thoughts!,"I headed over to my local Bloomingdale's last week, as one does on a Friday evening with nothing to do lol, and I spent some time in their private collections corner. My curiosity was piqued by Valentino Anatomy of Dreams and Prada Olfactories, two ranges I'm not familiar with. The attentive and lovely sales rep (shout out Muhammad!) talked me through some fragrances and gifted me lots of samples to try!! After a week of happily testing, I can share some thoughts! (Please keep in mind I've only been a fragrance enthusiast for the past 2 years, so I may not have the best vocabulary or knowledge/reference base to describe):

**\*Valentino Sogno in Rosso** (Black Pepper, Vanilla, Milk Foam) - I am not on FragranceTok, but I think this one is fairly hyped on sm. I think it's a beautiful, deep cold-weather scent. It's in the same universe as Blanche Bette -  the vanilla, milk foam - but I found the similarities greatest in the open. You can definitely tell the differences in the dry down. I'm not a fan of Blanche Bette; it smells like sour baby spit-up to my nose. I think that's bc of the jasmine, which often becomes sharp and pungent on my skin esp when combined with tuberose.

Sogno in Ross has none of this for me. It's deeper, spicier - perhaps a little more masc-leaning, but still unisex and addictive. The deeper amber notes ground Sogno in Rosso which I prefer to BB, which always seemed to stay ""floating"" in a way that turned me off. Sogno in Rosso feels more rounded. I also feel like it might have good longevity, as it stayed on my skin overnight. Seems like a perfect winter or evening-out scent!

**\*Valentino Punk Romantic** (Vanilla, Olivewood) - Though not listed as a note, I get tons of iris from this. I do not like iris-forward fragrances at all, you know that vintage lipstick smell? Well Punk Romantic seems heavy on it in the opening, very pencil shaving-y. So I am not going to be a fan! Eventually it dries down to a beautiful, luxurious vanilla with soft wood, but I don't like it enough to withstand the journey to get there. But if you are a fan of powdery iris and vanilla, I think you may enjoy!

**\*Valentino Private Talk** (Tuberose, Cappuccino) - This is so good, and I don't entirely understand why! The featured notes sounded like a strange combo to me (I haven't tried a coffee/tuberose fragrance before) so I thought no way this could work. Oh, but it does. I get strong coffee in the open and it's lovely. I feel like I don't usually smell any coffee in fragrances that claim it, so I was very happy to finally pick up on it here. That gives way to a lovely tuberose bloom - not too sharp or ""white floral"" (you know). I either love or hate tuberose, and here I love it. It has a sweetness (that bubble-gum quality) that complements the lingering coffee notes. I've read some reviews that described this scent, specifically the tuberose, as mature but I don't get that impression (and ""maturity level"" is often the reason I don't like strong white florals). This combo really works for me, I can't explain it - I just kept wanting to smell my arm all day!

**\*Prada Un Chant D'Amour** (Neroli, Orange Blossom, Musk) - Ohmygod I love this. LOOOOVVVEEEEE!! Love. But I am a big neroli, orange blossom and musk fan so maybe that's why :) It reminds me so much of L'eau Papier, which I am ready to make my whole personality at this point, but without the sesame or toasted rice notes. It's a musk scent, so definitely necessary to test on skin, but ughh it's beautiful. There's also cotton flower that lends a soft, clean, airy feeling. Jasmine is listed which made me nervous, but I don't detect anything pungent or indolic. I LOVE IT! Ofc Un Chant D'Amour is like double the price (stupid expensive), but if you are a fan of L'eau Papier I think you would really enjoy this fragrance!

Though I loved Un Chant D'Amour, I could never justify that price tag ($370 US) for what it is. So of these, I'd probably only consider buying a smaller bottle of Valentino Private Talk. I know people dislike the caps to the Anatomy of Dreams fragrances, and while I don't disagree that it nears tacky territory, it's ok haha. Gives a nod to the designer bottles and I can appreciate that.

If anyone else has tested or owns any of these fragrance, I would love to hear your thoughts! I feel like most of the reviews I've read regard these collections as not being that unique? So I would like to know other opinions, maybe realize how off-base I am haha. Thanks for reading!",2,1753557016.0,fragrance,0,1.0,False

1ma1l4l,https://i.redd.it/856opro8p9ff1.jpeg,I need a travelling companion,"When I started my transition I accepted that I would never be loved or feel the embrace of a woman again, friends tried to persuade me otherwise even when partial op but I couldn't see it happening. 

Then last weekend I was at a van festival and this gorgeous woman wrapped her arms around me and we danced and sang cheek to cheek and memories of how good it felt to hold someone and to be held flooded back. When the set ended  I was too shy to give her my contacts and we said our goodbyes. 24 hours later I considered driving 200 miles to Brighton to ask people in the street if they recognised her photo, realistically I'll never see Joanne again.

Although I'm incredibly happy now living as my true self the emptiness of being alone all these years has hit me hard. I've been daydreaming about driving off somewhere for a couple of days with someone, chatting, laughing, holding hands, watching the sun set, snuggling up together on the very cramped bed, cuddling and kissing until we fell asleep. Waking up to coffee and breakfast and a walk, hand in hand, drinking in the beauty of nature and getting lost in each other's eyes. 

Reality check. That's not going to happen but I'll be forever grateful for that brief time when there was that tantalising possibility.

I’m the founder of a small independent beverage brand called Wolfpussy’s Colombian Lemonade — a canned drink based on the traditional Colombian recipe agua de panela, made with unrefined cane sugar (panela) and fresh lime juice.

It’s simple, refreshing, and naturally shelf-stable. You can enjoy it cold from the can or heated up like a tea — it works both ways and surprises people every time. We’ve already gotten great feedback from grocery stores bars/clubs, restaurants, coffee shops, and food carts in the Pacific Northwest, and now I’m looking to expand into other markets.

🔍 What I’m Looking For:
	•	Distributors, independent reps, or delivery pros with access to shops, cafes, or corner stores
	•	Focus areas include Florida, Georgia, New York, California, and Texas, but open to anywhere with a strong Latino or tropical beverage-loving customer base
	•	Open to trial runs, first-pallet pricing, and helping new partners with product info and sampling support

✅ Why It Stands Out:
	•	Real panela and lime – no concentrate, no chemicals
	•	Shelf-stable, no refrigeration needed
	•	Can be enjoyed hot or cold
	•	Unique name and bold branding that turns heads

If you’re in distribution, have store connections, or just like helping unique small brands grow, shoot me a message or comment. Would love to connect and see if there’s a fit.

Thanks!

1ma1hhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ma1hhv/i_buried_my_grief_now_it_lives_beneath_my_backyard/,I buried my grief. Now it lives beneath my backyard,"They call me a pillar. That word was printed in the paper last fall, right before they gave me a plaque at the firehouse banquet. Pillar of the Community. I stood there, tie too tight, hands buzzing from too much coffee, smiling while the mayor read off my good deeds like they were part of a eulogy.

Fundraisers. Food drives. Disaster relief. I donate to every charity that asks. Never miss a council meeting. Shovel snow before sunrise. First to shake a new hand. Last to leave when the chairs need stacking. I've hosted the Fall Chili Supper twenty years running. Built the nativity set by hand last December. Cut each figure from pine, sanded until my fingers went raw. Painted them at night by lamplight while the house creaked around me like it was learning how to be empty. People say, “He’s the kind of man this world needs more of.” I nod. Because they’re right. They just don’t know why.

I had a family. Esther. Soft voice. Whole-face smile. The kind that made strangers talk longer than they meant to. She saved every note I ever left her on the fridge until the paper yellowed, and the ink gave up. Little things, “Back soon, love you. Pick up Zach at 4. You make everything better.” Even now, I sometimes imagine they're still there. I can picture her finger tracing the fading loops of my handwriting like it’s a prayer. Our boys, Milo and Zach, had her eyes. Wide-set. Steady. Milo was a goalie. Fast hands. Fearless. Zach used to line up model planes on the windowsill by size, then turn them all to face east “so they can take off faster.” I baptized them both. Held their heads under water, whispered, “You’re safe now.” Zach giggled when I said it. Milo didn’t. Milo looked at me like he believed it.

They died twelve years ago.

A semi hit black ice on Route 86. Jackknifed. Their car took the full weight. The truck driver walked away. They didn’t. I was on the phone with her when it happened.

 “Did you pick up some milk?”

 “Not yet, I-”

Silence. And then nothing ever sounded the same again.

The man who built our house dug a bunker beneath the yard. Concrete walls. Foam insulation. Steel hatch. Drain in the floor. He thought the world would end. It didn’t. He hung himself in the basement laundry before the housing crash. Left a short note: Batteries don't fix what breaks inside.

The shelter sat untouched for years. A sealed secret, humming faintly under our lives like a low-frequency note only grief can hear. I kept it locked. Didn’t think much of it. Then one night, months after the funeral, I woke up standing down there. Bare feet. Cold concrete. No memory of how I got there. The air was stale. The light hummed. The silence felt shaped, like it had corners. I didn’t cry. Didn’t pray. I just stood still, breathing. And in that silence, I felt something I hadn’t felt since the crash:

Time.

Not the kind you measure. The other kind. The kind that loops and echoes. The kind that waits for you to understand it isn’t moving. And never was.

They say time heals. It doesn’t. Time isn’t gentle. It grinds. It rots what it can’t erase. Time is a hallway where all the doors stay shut, and your hand just keeps reaching. It’s a voice you forgot belonged to you, saying the same thing every morning: Get up. Keep going. Smile, you bastard, they’re watching.

You want to know what time really is?

It’s the sound of begging that becomes background noise. It’s learning which bones snap clean and which ones flake like chalk. It’s skin peeling away from knuckles like wet paper. It’s silence that isn’t peace, it’s surrender. It’s the smell of rot in winter when nothing should smell like anything. It’s the muscle memory of cruelty, dressed in patience.

The first was a drifter. He tried to rob the church pantry. Knocked down Sister Wright. She’s eighty-three, maybe ninety pounds. Her glasses shattered. One lens stuck in her cheek like a splinter. She didn’t cry. Just said, “Oh,” like she was disappointed in herself. The cops let him go. Said the jails were full. I waited three days. Found him asleep behind the mill. He had a can of beans tucked under his arm like a teddy bear. I didn’t drug him. I didn’t hesitate. I used a hammer. He woke up on concrete, mouth stuffed with gauze, ankles chained to the floor. He looked up at me like I was someone he knew, or maybe once dreamed about.

That was the first time I felt anything since the accident. Not guilt. Not rage. Just awareness. Like hearing your own name whispered in an empty room. Like touching something warm and realizing it’s your own skin.

You want to know what I do to them. That’s fair. But there’s no ritual. No pattern. No goal. No code. No pleasure. No righteousness. No god involved. It’s not about them. It never was. It’s about me. It’s about the sound of the world slipping further away, and needing something louder to drown it out.

Some last hours. Some last years. I don’t measure. One hums tuneless melodies. Nursery rhymes warped by silence. His teeth are gone. I didn’t take them. Time did. Another writes prayers in blood. Ran out of space last spring. Now he loops the words over old ones. The wall is a dense net of dried red. I caught him licking it once trying to make more. There was one who kept pretending I wasn’t real. He talked to someone else. Called them Sarah. When he died, he was smiling. I don’t know why that’s the part that stuck with me. I could end it. Quickly. Easily. But that’s not the point. Pain isn’t the point either. The point is persistence. Proof.

I still pay my taxes. Still wave at the mailman. Still host the Fourth of July cookout. I even make the potato salad. Esther’s recipe. I can’t taste it, but I know when it’s right. I let the missionaries in. Offer lemonade. Ask how their mothers are. Smile when they talk about redemption. They ask if I’ve been reading my scriptures. I say, “Every morning.”

And I mean it. Sometimes I read them out loud to the hatch. I attend every funeral. Always the same black tie. Perfect Windsor. Shirt pressed. Hands folded just so. And when the streetlights buzz, and the last porch light clicks off, I go outside. Unlock the hatch. Descend the concrete steps. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s not. Sometimes, I just sit in the dark, breathing slowly, like I’m trying not to wake whatever I used to be. I listen. To them. To the walls. To whatever echoes inside me when everything else goes still.

People think they know what grief looks like. They see my clean lawn. My polished truck. A man still driving his wife’s car “to keep it in good shape.” They see someone who carried his burden with dignity. Who smiled. Who gave back. Who moved on. But that’s not me. That’s the uniform. That’s the lie.

I used to name what’s left. Grief. Depression. Penance. But names are for things with edges. This has none. There’s no flame. No purpose. No center. Just repetition. Just form without substance. A body brushing its teeth. Folding shirts. Stacking chairs. Checking locks. Feeding mouths that no longer ask for mercy.

No one notices the absence—not if the mask holds. But when I open the hatch. When I hear them cry, or hum, or whisper to something that won’t answer, I feel something. Not joy. Not guilt. Just weight. Proof that I still exist. Because even if there’s nothing in me worth saving, no fire, no soul, no center, at least something still hurts. ",4,1753556744.0,CreepCast_Submissions,0,1.0,False

9 day old, shes doing the sleeping great during the day thing, and the “let’s just scream” during most of the night thing.

I am lucky to have a chance to sleep during the day. And I know I don’t NEED coffee, but sometimes I really want it. Just to feel normal for an hour or two. 

But I haven’t been drinking it. Maybe half a cup every other day. I don’t want to miss day sleep.
 But at this point, I’m having to be nocturnal and I’m wondering if sipping some in the evening would be a bad idea?

If you are in the trenches does it matter? When do you drink your coffee is you drink it at all?


Also, it’s been 7 years since my last baby. I forgot about the burping :( and the gas. And the general what the fuckery at night. 


So far it seems like she just wants to nurse and be held, I think she’s overtired. 

But she will drain both boobs with burpings and changings and rockings in between but then still root and scream. 


I’m worried shes overfilling herself and making her tummy hurt, and I try to hold off on the boob. Like last night she literally just put it in her mouth to soothe. I’m cool with  that, but should I just offer the boob if she’ll take the boob?

Do I need to worry about her overfilling her little tummy?

Thanks if you can decipher this.

So the other night, I get back to my apartment after another lousy shift, and there’s a freakin’ letter addressed to me on my bed. Not in the stack of bills piled up under the mail slot, ON MY MATRESS. Looked like it came out of a fantasy story, fancy wax seal on the envelope and everything. I asked the landlady if the security cameras covering my hallway recorded anyone breaking in, but it just caught that punk from 4F making out with his latest girlfriend. All my windows were still locked from the inside when I checked. Creeped me the hell out.

 

I didn’t open the letter for a few days. Figured if someone was playing a prank on me, they’d out themselves if I didn’t bring it up for a while. But I got curious, and a few hours ago, I popped the seal and read it. here’s what it said:



 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Dearest Nephew,

 

If you are reading this, it means my long life has finally drawn to a close and I must pass along the Family Estate to my most eligible next-of-kin, which is you. Being a single man in his youth with few social obligations, you are the prime candidate to undergo this venture. Just imagine it: your own private island with a lavish mansion, breathtaking scenery, full amenities (even wifi!) and never having to work another day in your life! And all you have to do to leave the dreary world of the 9-5 wageslave, is pack your bags!



But I think I’m getting ahead of things. Allow me to introduce myself. You have never met me, but I am your father’s Great (great?) Uncle Stanley (your Grandmother Constance’s cousin). Given my less than respectable lifestyle in my youth, and my “disappearance” sixty years ago, it would be no surprise if the memory of me had been conveniently swept under the rug. I gather my life before undertaking this lifelong vacation bears similarity to yours; I kept to myself with little social interaction, had disinterest in work and studies, and had nothing to occupy my time but my vices. And much like yourself and those before me, I was in my early twenties when I got a letter from a forgotten relative with the deal of a lifetime. Since then, my entire life has been spent in luxury and peaceful isolation. I kept up to date with the outside world through newspapers, television, and the internet. Supplies arrive regularly at the dock, and I have never found myself wanting. I enjoyed many hobbies such as fishing, swimming, gardening, island chores, and even did a spot of writing.



Now, as I feel my age catching up to me, I must pass along this paradise and prepare its new tenant, or should I say Caretaker, for what awaits you should you choose to take up this offer. For while your life here will be luxurious, nothing is free, and there are a few simple responsibilities you must keep tabs on. That, and living in isolation means you must be aware of any and all hazards so as not to find yourself caught with the proverbial thumb up your keister. Don’t worry, our family has been enjoying this island for generations, and through over three centuries of trial and error, we have this place figured out to a tee. The mansion’s library will have all you could want to know about this place’s history and rules of upkeep, and I will write several more “cheatsheets” to help you with the more nuanced tasks. But for the sake of brevity, this letter’ll just get you up to speed on the process of getting you settled on your arrival.



Should you accept the responsibility, a car will pick you up at first light the day after you open and read this letter. You’ll know it when you see it. Don’t ask how it knows to come, just be ready at the curb with your belongings. Don’t leave anything behind you want to lose as you won’t be coming back. From there, you will be driven to port, where your driver will point out the ship waiting to take you to your new home. The crew will load your belongings; UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to offer to help them but DO be sure to thank them for their services. They’re persnickety about these things, and besides you’re about to begin a new life of leisure; no point in throwing all that away by becoming the newest member of the crew.  



Once onboard, the trip will take four days. Do not worry if you have a tendency towards seasickness; the helmsman is sure, and the ride is smooth no matter the weather. However, while you are allowed full access to the ship during the day, IT IS IMPERATIVE that at night you STAY ON THE TOP DECK. Under no circumstances should you venture below deck at night regardless of threats of impending storms, as the crew is restless and the moonlight’s protection won’t reach below. Instead, spend your nights at the forward topdeck near the ship’s figurehead, and sleep during the day in the shade. Also, while the cook is a surly individual, he has a jovial nature at heart and his cooking is immaculate. But whatever you do, DON’T ask for seconds, and POLITELY DECLINE THE GUMBO. Longpig may sound delicious but believe me when I say it is one culinary venture you don’t want to take.



When you arrive at the island, the crew will unload your belongings into a golf cart with a storage trunk parked near the dock for your convenience.  It is now safe to assist them if you so desire. Be sure to thank them again for their services and wish them well. Shake the Captain’s hand, but DO NOT do so with the Helmsman. Stay at the dock and watch until they sail out of sight. If you happen to see the ship capsize, check the mooring post on your right. If the time matches what was carved into the wood, then there is nothing to worry about. If it doesn’t, note the time for later, then begin making your way along the path to the Mansion up the hill.



You should reach the house well before sundown. Try not to get distracted with the scenery, there’ll be time enough for that later. The front door should be unlocked, but when you first arrive, pass it up and instead park the cart to the right of the mansion by the greenhouse. You can leave your belongings there; they will be moved to your quarters that night after you familiarize yourself with the house a bit. The door closest to the greenhouse opens into the kitchen. If the ship that brought you here went under at a time other than what was carved on the mooring post, write it down on the clipboard hanging next to the sink. Feel free to grab a LIGHT snack from the fridge if you’re feeling peckish but be sure to save room for dinner. Then walk through the green door which opens into the dining hall. The tables will be set and all but one of the chairs will be pushed in. Leave this chair out and the  half-eaten food in front of it untouched; it is the Custodian’s seat, and he will return to his meal after he brings in your belongings later in the night.



From the dining hall, you will walk into the main foyer. Take your time to appreciate the marble staircase, and see if you can make out the faint impressions left by feet from three centuries of our family treading up and down them. Make your way up to the third floor landing and take a right. The opulent door at the end of the hall is the Master Bedroom, but do not enter, as the custodian sleeps there between tenants and values his privacy. Instead, politely knock three times, and announce that you are the new occupant and will be requiring him to return to his assigned quarters by the morning. Then, return downstairs to the dining hall, where your own dinner will be waiting for you at the main table.



After dinner, be sure to stack your plates and utensils neatly. You want to make a good impression with the custodian. Then, return to the Foyer and go through the large green double doors on the other side of the mansion. This is the Library, where you will spend the night while the Custodian readies your room and gets you settled in. The armchair by the fireplace is quite comfortable, and in my recent years, I find myself comfortably sleeping here more than the master bedroom. While there is an extensive collection of books, I guess that you’ll be more interested in the small paper taped to the underside of the coffee table with the wifi password. However, I would advise you read the letter I will leave in the large green book on the writing desk. It will entail how to proceed with your first day as the Island’s Caretaker, as getting a feel for these things ahead of time helps.  By 9:45 p.m., close and lock ALL LOCKS on the double doors, and check to ensure the window locks are in place and NOT LOOSE. A small screwdriver is in the left drawer of the writing desk if they need to be tightened. Then, get comfortable and spend the rest of the night here. Ignore any noises coming from the hallway. The Custodian will be using the front door throughout the night, so expect to hear it opening several times. If you need to use the bathroom, there is one on the other side of the blue door to the right of the fireplace. There is a small case with reusable earplugs on the mantlepiece. I would advise you use them this first night, as the local wildlife tends to get vocal after 10:00 p.m., and while most are harmless, their calls can be unsettling for those unaccustomed to them. On that same note, if you hear your name in the night, DO NOT respond or react in any way. Just don’t. Trust me, it’s not worth it.



And that should cover your first night on the Island. You will be awoken in the morning with three knocks on the Double Doors. This is the Custodian letting you know he has finished transferring your belongings to the Master Bedroom. He will not enter the mansion again except for the scheduled cleaning days. From there, refer to my aforementioned letter in the green book for everything you’ll need to know about officially becoming Caretaker of the Island and all it entails.



I do hope you’ll take this chance of a lifetime, but the choice is of course yours. Regardless of your decision, I hope this letter found you well, and that you will continue to have a pleasant life.

 

Sincerely,

Great (Great?) Uncle Stanley



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

I still had the login for the family tree service my grandmother got for us before her passing, and sure enough, I did have a Great Uncle Stanley, although there was next to noting about him other than his name. While it could be (and probably IS) a scam, I gotta admit, it’s not like I’ve got a lot to lose. My job sucks ass, and I’ve had to sell most of my belongings just to cover the rent in this glorified storage unit of an apartment. I haven’t been close with most of my family in years, not since I was falsely accused of SA in highschool because the popular girl was bored. Same incident lost me the few friends I had so my social circle is non-existant too. I only have a small backpack, but it can fit what few clothes and possessions I have easily enough.

 

Honestly, I’m at the point where I’ll try anything over this dead-end life I’m living now. I’ve got my stuff out on my mattress ready to be packed, and let my boss know I won’t be in for a few days. I’m going to wait outside tomorrow for the car to pick me up. If you don’t hear from me in a week, they probably took my kidneys or something. I’ll post again when and if I can.

I’m passionate about life, deep convos, and hearing how other people see the world.

I don't want to just put up the link to I'm going to give you a sample of my post. It’s a list of the everyday plastics we generally use, often hidden from notice. 

—————————

Have you ever thought about how much plastic you use in a year? A month? A day? It’s not just obvious ones like grocery bags and bottled water. Many types of plastics are silently woven into our daily habits, right down to our tea bags. So, where are they hiding? Let's make a list.

This list paints a clear but not pretty picture—out of the 22 plastics on this list, only 3 are reusable, just 5 are conditionally reusable, and the other 14 are non-reusable. The list also shows that half are hidden—nestled in your home like secrets in plain sight. 

This list isn’t to scare you or guilt you, it’s to inform you of how much plastic can secretly reside in your everyday life. Knowing where these plastics are—hidden and obvious—can help you figure out how to lower your plastic use. 

The list here just has general items that people usually use. If you want to know what plastics are a part of your life, make your own list using this format, keeping track of what’s reusable and whether they’re obvious or hidden. It’ll be the first step in transitioning to a lifestyle with less plastic.

Now, I am unsure where I could start and would love to get some help regarding how to expand my horizons.

As to me; I am a 16 soon 17 year old high school student, in my free time I write journalistic articles for the local paper and the schools newspaper. I also work as a waitress in a local Inn, which is a job that I dearly love. I feel confident reading literary fiction (the genre I enjoy the most) in both English and German, and am slowly pushing myself towards French with the works of Yasmina Reza (I read Le Dieu du carnage and understood around 70% of it, and had to look up words a lot)
My favourite writers include Phillip Roth, I’ve recently finished the human stain and liked it well enough, but proffered portnoy. I will most definitely read more by him and am very open to suggestions. I generally like literature by jewish men written mid century, and am a big philosemetic
I also like the writing of J.D Salinger but have grown tired of him after overdosing on his short stories in the past six months (and I’ve read „Dream catcher“ by his quite talented daughter, which gave me a slightly sour feel about him)
I enjoy feminist literature in the vein of German feminists as well. I also liked Annie Ernaux book about her abortion and it greatly impacted me…


I want to expand my horizons and learn more through literature. But I have so many authors whose works I want to read and it’s a mass, really.
There are many authors I need to check out still as well, Hermann hesse, Chaim Potok, Dorothy Parker, Andrea Dworkin….
It’s quite overwhelming. Any tips on how I can decide on what to read? It’s truly „too many books, not enough time“ for me. 

Also, I’d love to discuss the works I’ve read, but sometimes fear the sub isn’t the right place for it. How can I find ppl (at best, IRL) who also enjoy literary fiction? I can hardly just email lit professors and ask if they wanna grab a coffee with me - but I’d love to

1ma17ea,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1ma17ea/a_gerd_success_story_for_those_that_feel_hopeless/,A Gerd Success Story For Those That Feel Hopeless,"I'm going to begin by sharing the steps I took to help heal the Gerd that had pretty much taken over my life. I'd like to preface by stating that I am in no way claiming that these steps will heal you as well. Gerd is a truly wild and seemingly random disease that at times seems to have no rhyme or reason and it affects everyone differently. I just hope that some of these steps may help those who are struggling and medication is not helping. I'm also not telling anyone to stop their medications and I'm not judging anyone who is taking medication. I'll discuss that in more detail below.

1. Eating 5-6 small meals a day, around 300-400 calories per meal.
2. Measuring all food portions using a food scale.
3. Logging and recording all foods and drinks using Nutritionix or a similar app.
4. Chewing your food slowly and thoroughly. Take 20-25 minutes to eat each small meal.
5. Not overeating any meal or stuffing yourself. Leave some room for the next one.
6. When feeling a bit full, walk it off. It helps relieve the bloating.
7. Not running or over exerting on a full stomach.
8. Not eating more than 10 grams of fat in a meal and severely lowering saturated fat intake.
9. Avoiding other trigger foods, which will differ individually.
10. Drinking between meals, not during them. This keeps the stomach from filling up too much.
11. Waiting at least 3-4 hours after your last meal before lying down and sleep at the steepest angle you can tolerate.
12. I took some other steps which I am not at liberty to share in this Subreddit.

Now, here's my story for those who are interested. In October of 2024 I began experiencing severe abdominal pain. It was loud and keeping me up at night. After several visits to the doctor and a negative ultrasound, I was referred to a GI and had an Endoscopy in December. While the results confirmed a stomach ulcer, I was surprised to discover I had been diagnosed with GERD and Barret's Esophagus. I met with the doctor and told him I'd never had any reflux symptoms. He said I was having silent reflux and needed to continue with the PPI I had been taking for my ulcer for a year. Oddly enough, around that time I started to experience a globus sensation (Food feeling stuck in my throat). January came around and my abdominal pain had finally subsided, but at the same time my reflux symptoms started to ramp up. I started getting constant sore throat, chest tightness, post nasal drip and belching frequently.

By February my symptoms kept getting worse, and they doubled my PPI dosage. Things got worse still, and despite the advice of my doctor, I discontinued the PPI (Protonix). Immediately my symptoms improved, but they didn't go away entirely. Around March I started getting heartburn and chest pains. I would bend down to put a dish in the dishwasher and get sharp, very abrupt pains radiating through my chest. Next came what is called a bounding pulse. I would wake up at night with an extremely pounding heartbeat radiating from my belly up into my chest. This also kept me awake at night. It would even occur if I fell asleep on the couch while sitting up. The chest pains got so bad that I stopped driving my car into town, because for some reason even the slightest change in posture would bring about those sharp chest pains. Every time I ate was a nightmare. I knew within an hour or two a combination of the above mention symptoms would ensue. After a visit with an ENT, I tried a combination of Gaviscon + Sodium Alginate with Famotidine. It seemed to work somewhat, but it was only temporary and the symptoms always seemed to pop back up. I had tried multiple changes to my diet and none of that seemed to work.

Then one day in April a friend of mine, who knew I was struggling so badly, sent me a screenshot from a book by Dr. Mark Hyman. He mentioned a correlation between high saturated fat intake and Gerd patients. I found that interesting as I had been on a high fat diet for sometime. Maybe that was the problem? So I started eating grilled chicken, carrots, and other low fat foods. Within 1 week my symptoms had improved by 90%.

Around that time I started going to a different GI doctor. They were concerned with my previous diagnosis that I should restart PPI and try something different. I began taking 40 mg of Nexium in the morning. Also around that time I was slowly letting fat back into my diet. This proved to be a mistake. My symptoms came back but they were worse. The heartburn became unbearable and there were many times when I had to pace my apartment for hours before I was able to lie down. I then tried 40mg of Nexium in the morning and 40mg of Famotidine at night. This helped the heartburn but the chest pains just kept on coming throughout the day.

My primary then referred me to a surgeon who I met with in May. He ordered a manometry, bravo ph study, and a repeat endoscopy. He advised to stop the medication as it was not eradicating my symptoms, and I was going to have to stop prior to my testing anyway. Around that time I had recalled how the low fat diet had helped me more than anything else. I decided to invest in a food scale this time around and measure all of the fat I was actually consuming and record it in an app called Nutritionix. I quickly realized just how much fat you can consume without noticing, and how it seems to be hiding in a lot of processed foods. I began to notice how much better I felt If I consumed around 10g of fat or less per meal, and I also learned that eating smaller meals more frequently made a huge difference as well.

My tests were scheduled for the end of June and beginning of July, and I ate like this for about 2 months. By the time I had my manometry and endoscopy, My symptoms were about 95% better, with some occasional chest pains. Flash forward to Wednesday of this week. I met with my surgeon to discuss the results of my testing. My main concern was that apparently I had been having silent reflux and didn't know it. Would the test reveal that? The doctor walked into the room with smile on his face. He said the manometry, bravo ph, and endoscopy all came back negative. I no longer had Barrett's Esophagus, there were not signs of reflux, and my stomach was completely clean with no ulcer.

As of this week I can truly say I'm symptom free for the first time in over half a year.  I've started to eat around 4 meals per day now, but I am going to continue with the low fat diet for at least a month longer just to be sure. I cannot imagine revisiting the horror I experienced for 6 months of my life. It was truly agonizing and sadly took up the majority of my head space during that time. I had researched thousands and thousands of articles and videos online and I had become exhausted with all the stuff I had tried.

I think back to my diet before the madness began, and it truly frightens me. I was eating copious amounts of fat and saturated fat, and I had never once stopped to measure how much I was actually consuming. Again, this proved to be MY trigger. This may not be your particular trigger, but with due diligence I hope that you can learn what exactly they are and get them under control. While many doctors still don't know the exact mechanism of Gerd, I theorize that in my case my body had had just about enough of the junk I was putting into it and began reacting. On top of all the greasy foods I was eating, I was drinking way too much coffee in the morning and pouring down hard seltzers in the afternoon. Again, I totally acknowledge that everyone's triggers are different.

I would like to add just a few more things. I do not oppose medication for the treatment of Gerd. My mom has been on Nexium for 30 years and without it she would have severe heartburn all day, every day. For me personally, the medication was not very effective. In fact, I've since learned that PPI is only effective for about 60% of Gerd Patients. [https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/gerd-not-responding-to-ppi](https://www.healthline.com/health/gerd/gerd-not-responding-to-ppi) This makes me wonder why in the world the doctors seemed totally shocked when they didn't work for me. That's 40 out of 100 people that don't have success. I don't want to go on a rant but I will say that from my experience the doctors showed absolutely ZERO interest in discovering the root cause of my disease.

If you've made it this far, I'll share my current food list and hope that may help someone as well.

Low Fat Peanut Butter Powder

Rice Cakes

Gluten Free Bread

Gluten Free Crackers

Watermelon

Nonfat Greek Yogurt

If you haven't yet figured out your own personal triggers, I would highly advise eating one food at a time and discover what it is that your body can handle, then slowly introduce foods after your symptoms have improved.",8,1753556064.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

1ma14vk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma14vk,Endgame Coffee Corner,"I think I have maxed out what my portion of the counter top can handle. If I ever get the upgrade itch now I have to move.

Finished the setup off with the Wug2 m1 motor kit for my HG1. Perfectly pairs with the Londinium Vectis for the most quiet setup and the tastiest lattes.

Things I like about this setup:

-Super quiet, no pump in the spring lever so the brewing process is completely silent. The HG1 was already pretty silent, the m1 mod kit doesn’t not change that, the motor itself is quieter than the sound of the beans being ground, I can even lower the speed if I need to make it even quieter.

-tactile feel of the spring lever gives infinite dopamine.

-m1 motor kit saves me from pulling the HG1 out of the corner and sliding it back everyday plus it now ads a lot more consistency as I can set the motor speed. Grinding by hand was very rewarding but you can’t grind with perfect consistency so sometimes you could affect the shot.

-The HG1 has very little retention, perfect for single dosing as long as you use RDT. As you can see in the background I am an avid user of dosing vials. 

-Being a spring lever, you only need 1 boiler to allow for steaming and brewing at the same time. With the motor kit for the HG1 and pre weighing beans, you can make a latte super quick.

Down sides of this setup:

- The Vectis has a pretty small boiler (1.5L) you can really only make 4-5 drinks before needing to refill the machine. This also sucks cause you can’t refill it while pressurized since you need to add water directly to the boiler. On a day today day basis, I don’t notice this much, refilling every morning is a little annoying but doesn’t take very long and you can do it will starting to heat up. However, hosting can be annoying cause you can’t pump out drink after drink.

-While spring levers can make some amazing espresso you can’t play with the profile too much. Something by like a decent or gagguino gives you far greater control.

-I used to have a high rpm hopper fed grinder, the convenience of sticking the portafilter in and grinding in 5s was incredible. The difference with the HG1 and m1 motor is not life changing, however it is noticeable better in terms of taste and consistency. 

-Decently expensive. My previous set up was a bambino and Compak e5 that I got off marketplace. Paid $700 total for that setup. This setup I also got completely used on marketplace (aside from the m1), though it cost me $4200. The quality of life and taste are better with this new setup, but not 6x better.

That word was printed in the paper last fall, right before they gave me a plaque at the firehouse banquet. Pillar of the Community. I stood there, tie too tight, hands buzzing from too much coffee, smiling while the mayor read off my good deeds like they were part of a eulogy.

Fundraisers. Food drives. Disaster relief. I donate to every charity that asks. Never miss a council meeting. Shovel snow before sunrise. First to shake a new hand. Last to leave when the chairs need stacking. I hosted the Fall Chili Supper twelve years running. Built the nativity set by hand last December. Cut each figure from pine, sanded until my fingers went raw. Painted them at night by lamplight while the house creaked around me like it was learning how to be empty. People say, “He’s the kind of man this world needs more of.” I nod. Because they’re right. They just don’t know why.

I had a family.

Esther. Soft voice. Whole-face smile. The kind that made strangers talk longer than they meant to. She saved every note I ever left her on the fridge until the paper yellowed, and the ink gave up. Little things, “Back soon, love you. Pick up Zach at 4. You make everything better.” Even now, I sometimes imagine they're still there. I can picture her finger tracing the fading loops of my handwriting like it’s a prayer. Our boys, Milo and Zach, had her eyes. Wide-set. Steady. Milo was a goalie. Fast hands. Fearless. Zach used to line up model planes on the windowsill by size, then turn them all to face east “so they can take off faster.” I baptized them both. Held their heads under water, whispered, “You’re safe now.” Zach giggled when I said it. Milo didn’t. Milo looked at me like he believed it.

They died twelve years ago.

A semi hit black ice on Route 86. Jackknifed. Their car took the full weight. Driver walked away. They didn’t. I was on the phone with her when it happened.

  
“Did you pick up some milk?”

  
“Not yet, I-”

  
Silence. And then nothing ever sounded the same again.

The man who built our house dug a bunker beneath the yard. Concrete walls. Foam insulation. Steel hatch. Drain in the floor. He thought the world would end. It didn’t. He hung himself in the basement laundry before the housing crash. Left a short note: Batteries don't fix what breaks inside.

The shelter sat untouched for years. A sealed secret, humming faintly under our lives like a low-frequency note only grief can hear. I kept it locked. Didn’t think much of it. Then one night, months after the funeral, I woke up standing down there. Bare feet. Cold concrete. No memory of how I got there. The air was stale. The light hummed. The silence felt shaped, like it had corners. I didn’t cry. Didn’t pray. I just stood still, breathing.  
And in that silence, I felt something I hadn’t felt since the crash:

Time.

Not the kind you measure. The other kind. The kind that loops and echoes. The kind that waits for you to understand it isn’t moving. And never was.

They say time heals. It doesn’t. Time isn’t gentle. It grinds. It rots what it can’t erase. Time is a hallway where all the doors stay shut, and your hand just keeps reaching. It’s a voice you forgot belonged to you, saying the same thing every morning: Get up. Keep going. Smile, you bastard, they’re watching.

You want to know what time really is?

It’s the sound of begging that becomes background noise. It’s learning which bones snap clean and which ones flake like chalk. It’s skin peeling away from knuckles like wet paper.  
It’s silence that isn’t peace, it’s surrender. It’s the smell of rot in winter when nothing should smell like anything. It’s the muscle memory of cruelty, dressed in patience.

The first was a drifter. He tried to rob the church pantry. Knocked down Sister Wright. She’s eighty-three, maybe ninety pounds. Her glasses shattered. One lens stuck in her cheek like a splinter. She didn’t cry. Just said, “Oh,” like she was disappointed in herself. The cops let him go. Said the jails were full. I waited three days. Found him asleep behind the mill. He had a can of beans tucked under his arm like a teddy bear. I didn’t drug him. I didn’t hesitate. I used a hammer. He woke up on concrete, mouth stuffed with gauze, ankles chained to the floor. He looked up at me like I was someone he knew, or maybe once dreamed about.

That was the first time I felt anything since the accident. Not guilt. Not rage. Just awareness. Like hearing your own name whispered in an empty room. Like touching something warm and realizing it’s your own skin.

You want to know what I do to them. That’s fair. But there’s no ritual. No pattern. No goal. No code. No pleasure. No righteousness. No god involved. It’s not about them. It never was. It’s about me. It’s about the sound of the world slipping further away, and needing something louder to drown it out.

Some last hours. Some last years. I don’t measure.

One hums tuneless melodies. Nursery rhymes warped by silence. His teeth are gone. I didn’t take them. Time did. Another writes prayers in blood. Ran out of space last spring. Now he loops the words over old ones. The wall is a dense net of dried red. I caught him licking it once trying to make more. There was one who kept pretending I wasn’t real. He talked to someone else. Called them Sarah. When he died, he was smiling. I don’t know why that’s the part that stuck with me.

I could end it. Quickly. Easily. But that’s not the point. Pain isn’t the point either. The point is persistence. Proof.

I still pay my taxes. Still wave at the mailman. Still host the Fourth of July cookout. I even make the potato salad. Esther’s recipe. I can’t taste it, but I know when it’s right. I let the missionaries in. Offer lemonade. Ask how their mothers are. Smile when they talk about redemption. They ask if I’ve been reading my scriptures. I say, “Every morning.”

  
And I mean it. Sometimes I read them out loud to the hatch. I attend every funeral. Always the same black tie. Perfect Windsor. Shirt pressed. Hands folded just so. And when the streetlights buzz, and the last porch light clicks off, I go outside. Unlock the hatch. Descend the concrete steps. Sometimes it’s quiet. Sometimes it’s not. Sometimes, I just sit in the dark, breathing slowly, like I’m trying not to wake whatever I used to be.

I listen. To them. To the walls. To whatever echoes inside me when everything else goes still.

People think they know what grief looks like. They see my clean lawn. My polished truck. A man still driving his wife’s car “to keep it in good shape.” They see someone who carried his burden with dignity. Who smiled. Who gave back. Who moved on. But that’s not me. That’s the uniform. That’s the lie.

I used to name what’s left. Grief. Depression. Penance. But names are for things with edges. This has none. There’s no flame. No purpose. No center. Just repetition. Just form without substance. A body brushing its teeth. Folding shirts. Stacking chairs. Checking locks. Feeding mouths that no longer ask for mercy.

No one notices the absence, not if the mask holds. But when I open the hatch. When I hear them cry, or hum, or whisper to something that won’t answer, I feel something. Not joy. Not guilt. Just weight. Proof that I still exist. 

Because even if there’s nothing in me worth saving, no fire, no soul, no center, at least something still hurts.",3,1753555782.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Hey, bit of an odd request but hear me out.

I’m looking for someone to help me shop for clothes so I don’t look like this https://imgur.com/a/fBpor5o

A bit about me: I’m a 6’3 athletic-ish guy looking to upgrade my style. I’ve been a bit of a nerd for most of my life so I didn’t develop a good fashion taste. I do Muay Thai and Judo, love reading and deep convos, and lately I’ve been trying to step up how I present myself. I’ve got an okay taste (I think)  but I could use a second opinion (bonus if you know how to dress tall guys).

If you’re into fashion, or just like shopping and people watching, maybe we hit the mall or some thrift spots together? Totally platonic and pressure free just good vibes, maybe a coffee after (on me ofc). 

Ideally I’m looking for a lady my age, but I’m open to older ladies and guys if they got extremely good taste.


Who knows, maybe we both find some cool pieces.

DM if you’re down ✌🏾

1ma1209,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ma1209/aita_for_not_playing_games_with_my_male_best/,AITA for not playing games with my male best friend since I got a boyfriend?,"This story takes place in 2022, so the ages are: me (F18), best friend (M19) and boyfriend (M21). I am writing this today to have a fresh perspective from people that have no correlation to the story because my friend is still bringing this up after 3 years, even though we already ""settled"" the matter back then. English is not my first language, sorry for grammar !!

So a little back story, I'm best friends with a guy and a couple of girls, who introduced me to my current boyfriend over videogames and we all later started talking through discord around 2021. During this time, my guy best friend was showing me a lot of games and downloading games on my new PC for me to play. Since I'm not really a single player gamer, I didn't really play these said games. I mostly like to watch others play them or play multiplayer games with my friends, which he knows. Before my boyfriend came into the picture, we were all playing Genshin impact and Among us together.

One day, my best friend (let’s call him Alex) invited my boyfriend (they had previously known each other) to his world to help him farm some materials because he had been playing since launch and was much stronger in game than all of us. I joined them after and basically that's how I met my boyfriend. After that, we started playing co-op together more and more. My friend group had our own discord server back then and we invited my boyfriend so we can talk to him over call. But every time our gaming session ended, Alex would kick him out of the server because ""he's older than us and we shouldn't bother him with our spam if we're not playing together"". That was always weird to me, but I didn't think much of it. Somewhere around that time, Alex also dragged me to play League of legends with his friends that I haven't met before and also didn't know how to really play the game as I only played Wild Rift on my phone (same game, just on mobile) and the controls are a lot different on PC. I kind of had major social anxiety back then, and the thought of playing a game I'm not really familiar with, with people I never talked to before and me being younger than them scared me and I was always hesitant to agree to play with them.  
But one day I bit the bullet and said sure, let's play. When I got into their server, they said hello and that was about it. I at least thought Alex would guide me in the conversation or something, but he didn't, he just started talking to others like I was not really there. It was very awkward and I reaaaally hated it. After a few minutes, we started playing, and of course, I sucked, I hated the feeling because they have been playing since season 3 or 4 (which is around 2014-2016 I think, don't quote me on that). I played two games I think, and said okay I have to go now, see ya and dipped. I almost had a panic attack from that because I felt invisible and awful for not knowing how to play. The other guys didn't really say anything to me or during the game so it was really really awkward. After I went out of the call, Alex texted me why did you leave? I said I couldn't anymore and that it was overwhelming for me that I'm sorry, he said '...kay'.

A few months passed, I got with my boyfriend and we all started hanging out + some of my boyfriend’s friends. This was still during covid, so we didn’t go out much, we mostly played games together, but we would still hang out from time to time irl. My boyfriend and I mostly played Genshin together and then my other friends joined in when they had time. But Alex stopped playing with us around the same time I started dating my bf. So we only played Fall guys and Rocket league with him.  
Shortly after, Alex started distancing himself from me and my boyfriend, he would only hang out with me if it was a group hangout with all of us, but before we used to just hang out one on one. One day, after my birthday had passed and he didn't wish me a happy birthday, I texted him and said what’s up, what’s he doing and stuff like that, he answered I was busy, that's the reason I didn't talk to you. I said yeah me too, busy with guests and all that ya know. He said 'ah yeah, btw happy birthday' which immediately rubbed me the wrong way, because cmon, I texted him 3 days after my birthday, so I think he could've texted me at some point on his own but whatever. I was kinda passive aggressive and said ah good for you on remembering finally. I asked if he had a problem with me or something, because he was distancing himself from me and didn't wish me a happy birthday which takes 10 seconds to do, and he had plenty of reminders from other friends, facebook, instagram and such. He said he was really busy and just didn't have the time to text or call me, but that I should already know why he is angry with me.   
I didn't know what he was talking about, because I really didn't do anything, I never changed my behavior towards him since I got with my boyfriend, for the record, he is also not banning me from hanging out with Alex to get that out of the way, and Alex also knew my boyfriend before we were together as I already said. I didn't think much of this because he got with my then girl best friend, also a part of our friend group only a year before (they knew each other from middle school but were just friends). His immediate message was really? You have no idea what it might be? I of course said no, he continued that I don't give a fuck about him anymore, that I don't do anything he suggests, I just brush it over, that I was claiming to be socially awkward with his friends when we played League but when my bf came it was magically cured (no, he just introduced me to them better, they were the same people with whom I played League before). I said it was not true, I just didn't like to play games with people I didn't know, which at that time was still the truth, I did get better at managing my social anxiety but I was still being quiet most of the time around new people. But that wasn't the case, he accused me of being petty and being silent on purpose because I just didn't like the idea of playing with them to which I said wtf are you talking about, ""Mhm, yeah right, you would never, you were angry at me for a week after that"". I was, but I think for a good reason, he put me into a situation that I told him sounded uncomfortable to me and didn't help me converse in any way, and I was not mad for a week, maybe 2 or 3 days, and I explained that I was being salty, not mad. He then added that I was not being fair to him, he asked the guys to be extra polite to me (and they obviously thought that meant ""ignore her and don't talk to her""), that he doesn't understand why I would behave like that, that everything I do has consequences, something I find small could mean a lot to other people, that since I got a new PC I don't play anything with him, nothing he downloaded for me, that he only played Genshin with me and friends because he didn't think I would play it that much and that I would start playing different games with him later on, I obviously don't need him anymore.   
This really hurt my feelings because I really didn't change my behavior towards him, other than not really playing games he wanted with him or the single player ones, but I told him beforehand that I don't really like playing games alone. I told him that of course I still liked our friendship, nothing less than before, and that I didn't want to fight over stupid video games to which he continued that I stopped hanging out with him, stopped calling and caring which is not true. Us 4 (me, my bf, him and his gf) went regularly on double dates, where he would only talk to my bf about games and tech and such, and then me and his gf (also my best friend) would just casually chat and talk about our own interests. He said that he was honestly waiting for me to talk to him first, to ask about his day, how he is and such, because he was convinced I wouldn't talk to him unless he forgot to wish me a happy birthday, that I should play something with him and that he only played Genshin with me so we can do something together and I should return the favour because he hated the game (obviously he didn't tell me this before, I just thought he got bored with the repetitiveness and grindy part of the game). I didn't really understand his problems because we played other games together, just not alone anymore. I said I was sorry and some other things and organised an outing so we can talk things through in person. He agreed and we went for a coffee. It was mostly small talk in the beginning but I said I wanted to talk about our fight to which he said ""Well I mean, we already said everything, we'll get over it, it wasn't anything major"" and that's it, we said nothing more on this situation, our coffee continued like any other hangout.

I wanted to ask random people on the internet for an opinion, because about a year ago me and his gf, my then best friend fell out and he stopped hanging out with me, probably because she told him he can't hang out with me or something like that. He would then actively ignore me while continuing to talk to my bf no problem during group hangouts. I recently asked him what's his problem, they broke up months ago but he still didn't want to speak to me and he brought up the fight we had, the fight mentioned above, as the reason he was mad at me.

Just wanted to share something that’s helped me tremendously with acid-related issues—especially around foods and drinks I used to love.

I used to react to everything: coffee, citrus, tomato-based meals—even “healthy” stuff like lemon water would leave me feeling wrecked. Heavy, sour feeling in my gut, brain fog, and weird energy crashes after eating.

I tried all the usual fixes—cutting foods, spacing meals, antacids—but none of it really addressed the underlying *sensitivity*. So I started digging into how the body actually buffers acid internally—and found some fascinating chemistry.

What made the biggest difference was a **balanced mineral system** your body already uses to maintain pH. I experimented with **sodium and potassium bicarbonates**, reacted in specific ratios with **citric acid**, to generate **sodium citrate and potassium citrate**—the exact **quad-buffer** system your metabolism already uses for homeostasis.

I also include trace amounts of citrate salts in the original mix as catalysts to ensure a complete, smooth reaction. (That turned out to be important.)

Since I started drinking this quad-buffer alkaline water with meals, everything changed:

* ☕ I can drink coffee again with no burning or crashes
* 🍅 I eat acidic meals without the ""acid dump"" feeling
* 🧠 My energy and focus stay steady after eating
* 🤸 Digestion is calm, predictable, and honestly effortless

I use it daily now. I ended up formulating my own version because I couldn’t find anything like it on the market—but I’m not here to sell anything. Just wanted to share what worked for me, in case it helps anyone else.

A lot of people think they’re just “sensitive” when it may actually be a **buffering imbalance**.

Happy to share the science, ratios, or recipe if anyone’s interested.  
Wishing you relief and good digestion 💙

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Everton vs. Huachipato: A Tale of Two Streaks (and One Very Tired Pitch)**  
*By Your Humorously Analytical Sports Oracle*

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient parrots with a penchant for sports betting, we gather to witness a clash of despair: **Everton** (13th, 15 points) vs. **Huachipato** (10th, 21 points). Both teams are so desperate for a win, they’ve probably started sending motivational tweets to their own goalposts. Let’s dissect this like a overcooked *empanada*—with precision, a little grease, and a side of jokes.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Bookies’ Favorite?

The odds tell a story of cautious optimism for Everton and a “please just don’t lose” vibe for Huachipato. The most common head-to-head line has **Everton at 1.95 (decimal)**, implying a **51.3% chance** of victory. Huachipato’s odds hover around **3.75**, translating to a **26.7% chance**, while the draw sits at **3.4 (29.4%)**. For context, Everton’s implied probability is about the same as a Chilean coffee surviving a transatlantic flight without going cold. Not great, but not impossible.

The spread? Everton is a **-0.5 favorite**, meaning they’re expected to win outright (no draws allowed). Take the under on goals (**2.25 max**) if you want to bet on a snoozefest; these teams have combined for more yawns than a Monday morning meeting.

---

### Team News: Injuries, Streaks, and Existential Crises

**Everton**: This team hasn’t won at home since March 27—longer than a Netflix series without a season finale. Their six-game home losing streak is so legendary, the Sausalito Stadium probably whispers apologies to visiting teams. Coach Jaime García is pleading for “consistency,” which is code for “I need a miracle and a new job.”

Thanks for any insights!

1ma0q2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleArea/comments/1ma0q2y/explore_ancheer_electric_bike_review_is_this_the/,Explore ANCHEER Electric Bike Review Is This the Best City Commuter?,"The **ANCHEER AMA005792 26'' Electric Bike for Adults** markets itself as the ultimate city commuter with its peak 750W motor, sleek Baroque-inspired design, and handy extras like a basket and LCD display. I've had the pleasure of testing this electric bike daily over the past month across various conditions—from congested urban streets to peaceful park trails. While the bike has plenty of strong points, there are also a few quirks to consider before making it your next ride. Here's how it held up for me.

**Design and Looks**  
The first thing that stood out about this bike was its retro elegance, thanks to its Baroque-inspired lines. The crisp white color and thoughtful inclusion of a front basket gave it a stylish yet practical vibe. Its step-through frame makes it very convenient for riders who don’t want to fuss with a tall frame—especially helpful when commuting or wearing business attire. At 28 kilograms, it's not featherlight, but the sturdy iron frame justifies that weight, giving it a durable feel. The wide and padded saddle was a lifesaver for long rides, perfectly blending comfort and functionality. Paired with chrome-plated rails, this saddle even has a touch of personality.  

**Performance and Range**  
This e-bike comes equipped with a 48V/374Wh battery nestled neatly under the saddle, making it easily removable for charging or security purposes. Charging it was straightforward, and it delivered a respectable range of 25–55 miles per full charge. During my trials, I hit closer to 40 miles on a medium pedal-assist setting, although that varied depending on terrain and weather. The 750W peak motor is robust without being overkill, and while it doesn’t turn the bike into a road monster, it handles inclines and long commutes like a champion. Perfect for daily city use or light trail escapades.  

**Advantages**  
- The removable, discreet battery is practical and blends seamlessly into the bike’s design.  
- Peak 750W motor offers solid power for uphill rides and city cruising.  
- Wide and padded saddle ensures a comfortable ride even for longer journeys.  
- Inclusion of a sturdy front basket adds utility for shopping trips or short hauls.

**LCD Display and Controls**  
There's an upgraded LCD display that felt intuitive. It shows speed, mileage, and cruise control status, so I never had to guess how much battery life I was working with or when I needed to ease off on the throttle. Navigating such features while riding was a breeze, and it gave the bike a more polished, updated feel. The display's visibility in low-light conditions was decent too, although you’d probably want better lighting if you plan to ride after sunset.  

**Positives**  
- Intuitive LCD display makes tracking speed and mileage simple.  
- The cruise control option is a bonus for steady commutes.  

**Braking and Gear Options**  
The bike’s mechanical disc brakes performed admirably, ensuring a steady stop even during unexpected moments—whether in light rain or gravel-packed trails. Shifting gears was smooth, thanks to the 7-speed twist-grip gearbox, which also noticeably improved climbing on steeper inclines. For everyday commutes, it felt just the right amount of versatile without overwhelming me with unnecessary gear options.  

**Drawbacks**  
- While functional, the mechanical disc brakes occasionally squealed, especially after extended usage.  
- The weight of the bike may make it harder to carry if you need to bring it upstairs frequently.  

**Ease of Assembly**  
I tackled the assembly process myself, and ANCHEER's claim of being 85% pre-assembled was spot on. The instructions were straightforward, supplemented by a helpful video. With a little focus (and a coffee nearby), I managed to pull everything together in about 30 minutes. For less DIY-savvy folks, it might take a bit longer, but it’s not intimidating at all. However, a more clearly labeled parts list would have shaved five to ten minutes off my time.  

**Competing Products**  
Against its competitors, such as the Nakto City Electric Bike and the Ancheer 500W Folding E-Bike, the AMA005792 stands out for its unique design and aesthetic. The Nakto offers heftier cargo space and slightly larger motors in some models, while Ancheer’s foldable option is better suited for tight storage. However, the Baroque-inspired design of this model, the range, and the thoughtful comfort additions make it a strong contender for casual city riders. Where it slightly falters is in portability compared to folding models or ultra-lightweight options.  

**Price Performance**  
For the features offered, this bike is well worth its price point in my opinion. You’re getting a balanced electric bike with solid range, strong motor performance, and a design that doesn’t sacrifice style for practicality. While there are other more budget-friendly or compact options, the extras on this model, including the saddle, display, and step-through frame, make it worth the investment. Those planning daily commutes or casual weekend rides will find their money well spent here.

1ma0mi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ma0mi7/a_copy_of_my_wife_and_kids_deep_in_the_woods/,"A Copy of My Wife and Kids, Deep in the Woods","It all started last-last weekend. I had parked just shy of the forestry gate, where the gravel thinned out, and the trees began thickening. From here, it was a few hours on foot - just enough time and distance to let the peacefulness settle in. That was all I really wanted - a little quiet. No reception, no chatter; just the trail ahead, and whatever passed for clarity in this day and age.

I left my phone in the glovebox. Not to make a statement as such - I just didn’t want to feel it buzzing in my pocket, needing, reminding.

The air smelled clean. Pine, crisp northern winds, and something familiar and damp, like the memory of water that had long since sunk into the ground. I slung my pack over one shoulder, and started walking, letting the rhythm pull me listlessly forward. There was just something calming about walking alone - neither too fast, nor too slow - exactly my own pace - that made me feel like I had a little more control over my life again.

The trees weren’t especially tall, leaning just slightly inward, as if they had something to confide in me - an innocent little secret between myself and the forest. The path wound forward, without promise or urgency. Late afternoon light filtered through the canopy like little threads of gold; slow dissolves, like a weary, introverted sun who had enough of being directly seen.

Time stretched ever forward, like a lazy cat, greeting its owner after a long, grueling day at work. After a while, I stopped walking in minutes, and began walking in distances-between-thoughts. 

I wasn’t exactly looking for anything. I wasn’t really running from anything either.

I told them I’d be back the next morning. Maybe a touch later. Just needed a breather, I said. They nodded - not dismissively, perhaps just- tired in their own ways. Maybe they were happy to have the house to themselves for a change.

It wasn’t always like this. We used to move like parts of the same body - not exactly perfect, but - close enough to feel whole. There was a sort of rhythm in the way we bickered, laughed, touched elbows at the dinner table.

And then came the camping trip, last month. What was meant to be a long weekend away in the mountains - a break from all the screens and internet. It happened suddenly. I went ahead to look for firewood, and they took a wrong turn trying to follow.

I found them again, a full week later.

They’d turned up some fifty miles north, by a reservoir I’d driven past some hundreds of times during my search. No injuries, no scratches, barely a clear story. Just tears and hugs and confused explanations. Something about getting turned around, following odd trails. 

It didn’t matter anymore, though. I had found them again.

But something had changed, subtly, after that. They were a touch quieter, somehow. Or maybe it was me. Maybe I’d stared at that empty tent for too long, whispering their names into the dark. Maybe I’d come too close to accepting the idea that they were gone forever.

We never really broached the subject. After the initial joy wore off, we just drifted back into routine. Work. School. House-chores. But somehow, things never quite clicked back into place. The pieces all looked the same - they still laughed at the same shows, still left dishes half-done in the sink, but - it still didn’t quite feel the same.

My son and daughter, Alex and Ellie, stopped asking me to read before bed. My wife, Lauren, started waking up before me, and taking long walks alone. Sometimes, I’d find them all together, sitting in the living room, discussing something that went quiet as soon as I entered. Not secretive - just… separate.

I never resented them for it. Nor did I feel especially left out. Mostly, it just felt like the threads that had tied us together had loosened, just a little. They were still mine, as far as I was concerned. Still loved me. But sometimes, when they laughed too hard at nothing I could hear - when they exchanged glances I couldn’t decipher, I’d catch myself thinking: these are the versions that came back.

And wondering if that was enough for me.

I must have walked for hours.

Not with purpose. Not really. Just following one trail after another, watching the way the sun filtered through the leaves, letting it all pull me deeper into the woods. A part of me was hoping I’d get tired. That I’d sit down somewhere and clear my head.

But I didn’t. I kept walking.

Past old logging stumps, crooked stone outcroppings, and mossy bridges, I kept thinking about home - how the house might feel right now. Quiet. Stretched thin. I imagined Lauren sitting at the kitchen table, flicking through her phone. Ellie and Alex squabbling in the other room, half-bored, half-wired from screen time. The little life we’d built together still buzzing along without me.

The sun kept sinking. The woods turned golden, then bronze, then something colder - all gray tree trunks and long blue shadows. I found myself on a ridge I didn’t recognize. The trail had thinned to little more than deer path.

I stood still for a while, watching the sun brush its last warmth across the trees.

The light had gone syrupy - thick and golden, oozing between the trunks like it was reluctant to leave. Shadows stretched long and crooked, flickering softly as the wind stirred the upper branches. A pair of birds darted overhead, trailing a thread of sound behind them that frayed and vanished into the stillness.

Everything felt paused, like the forest was holding its breath, waiting to see what I’d do.

I sighed. Adjusted the strap of my pack. And turned around.

Time to man up. Go back. Face the noise, the mess, the tight little world that waited for me.

I took the same path, weaving through underbrush in the reverse of my own trail. Branches snagged less this time. The air felt cooler. Quieter, too. Not dead, but subdued. The way it sometimes got before the evening birds started their songs.

Up ahead, I could just make out the turnoff that led toward the trailhead, toward the gravel lot where my truck waited. I pictured the climb down, the way the headlights would cut through the blue dusk. Maybe I’d stop somewhere on the drive back. Get Lauren’s favorite milk. Try to do something right. I stepped forward-

A voice. Low. Close.

“Daniel?”

I froze.

“Daniel — is that you?”

*Lauren?*

I turned.

The trees swayed gently.

“Please. I’m scared. I don’t know where I am.”

I stood at the edge of the trail, breath sharp in my throat.

“Daniel, please.”

Her voice again. Almost whimpering.

“I think I’m hurt.”

My mouth went dry. A strange urge to run. But it was her voice. Not just the sound — the cadence. That soft, uncertain rise she used to have when trying not to cry.

The one I hadn’t heard in years.

“Dad?”

Another voice. Higher. Cracking at the edges.

“Dad, where are you?”

Alex.

Then — barely a beat later:

“Daddy? I’m scared. Where are you?”

Ellie.

Her voice shook — the exact pitch she’d used when the power went out, when she was six and couldn’t find her nightlight.

My hands trembled.

Because I’d heard these voices before. But not like this. Not since before the camping trip.

Before they came home colder. Distant.

Smiling too tightly. Hugging too briefly.

Back when they still looked at me like I was theirs.

“Daniel?”

Lauren again. Just over the ridge.

“I’m here.”

The words escaped before I could stop them.

Then - the dry crunch of leaves underfoot. A rhythm. Getting closer.

I turned.

Three figures emerged from the brush - clothes torn, faces streaked with soot and dirt.

Lauren stumbled toward me. Then the kids. Ellie clinging to Alex’s arm, eyes wide with a desperate, aching kind of hope.

“Daniel,” Lauren whispered, voice cracking. “Oh my god - Daniel!”

She threw her arms around me. I caught her on reflex. Felt her weight, the tension in her limbs. She smelled like pine and smoke and sweat.

She smelled real.

The kids were next. Alex burying his face in my coat, Ellie’s arms locking tight around my ribs.

“We- we didn’t know where you went,” Lauren said. “Everything was strange. The trees… they kept changing. We thought…”

She pulled back. Studied my face.

“Are you okay?”

I wanted to say yes.

They felt solid. Familiar.

They clung to me like people who’d survived something unspeakable.

And for one trembling second, I almost believed.

But then, like a crack through glass:

*Weren’t they supposed to be home?*

I didn’t say it aloud, but I must have felt something was wrong. That subtle stiffness in my shoulders. The way my eyes kept flicking around without thought. The way I stayed one step behind them as we walked.

I told myself the only explanation that made sense - that they’d come out looking for me in the dead of night and gotten lost. The woods could twist and turn you without warning. Maybe they’d just wandered too far. Long enough to lose their bearings. Long enough to feel scared.

But something deeper disagreed. A quiet wrongness that wouldn’t settle.

Like stepping into a familiar room where everything’s been moved half an inch.

Your body notices, even if your mind can’t say why.

I couldn’t bring myself to ask. I was scared of their answer - scared of what it might mean. So I said nothing. Just led them toward the road.

We didn’t talk much on the way. They were exhausted. Ellie tripped twice, and I carried her for a while. Lauren kept glancing at me like she was afraid I’d vanish again if she looked away. I smiled each time, told her we’d figure everything out soon.

…

We reached the truck just before dusk. Lauren laughed, soft and dazed, when she saw it.

“You still drive this old thing?”

I nodded - not responding in words, unlocking the door.

Ellie fell asleep leaning against the window as soon as we pulled onto the road. Lauren held her hand. I kept both eyes on the stretching lines of the highway, stealing glances at my family every so often - just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming it all.

…

But of course, reality had to eventually come crashing down.

We pulled into the driveway just as the porch light came on. I killed the engine. The truck was filled with silence - the kind that comes right at the precipice of the irreversible.

For a second, I just sat there. One hand rested on the wheel. My reflection in the windshield betraying my apprehension back to me. Lauren stirred beside me. Ellie and Alex yawned in the back seat, stretching and blinking themselves awake.

Then the front door creaked open.

And Lauren - the other Lauren - stepped out onto the porch. My Lauren. At least, the Lauren that I’d kissed goodbye that morning. Her hair was still tied up from cooking, and she was wiping her hands off with a dish towel.

She smiled when she saw the truck. Familiar. Unbothered.

“You’re back early - do you want sup-”

Then she saw them. 

Her voice cut mid-syllable.

The dish towel fluttered down onto the gravel at her feet.

I could barely breathe - my hand on the cab door - stuck half open.

The other Lauren - the one in the car with me - had gone ghostly pale. Her eyes locked on the woman standing on the porch. Her mouth moved - once, twice - without any sound.

Ellie gripped my sleeve, whispering.

“Daddy?”

I didn’t answer. All I could see was Lauren looking at Lauren. My eyes filled with something beyond fear. The one question I'd dreaded the possibility of having to ask.

*If she’s here, at home… then who did I bring back?*

Porch-Lauren took a step back. Her eyes were locked on the woman beside me - the same face, the same eyes, the same trembling lips.

“Daniel…” she said, barely an audible whisper. “What is this?”

I glanced at her, and back at the Lauren next to me. Her hand rested, faintly, against the passenger-side door. She looked like she was on the edge of collapsing inward.

The words turned to ash in my mouth.

Porch-Lauren stood there, not crying, but tears streaming down her face nonetheless.

Porch-Alex’s hand had flown up to cover his mouth, and porch-Ellie held her head in her hands, whispering *no no no* to herself, backing toward the house like she could undo it all by stepping out of frame.

The ones beside me?

Frozen.

Staring.

Mouths agape.

As if struggling to comprehend the crushing weight of truth that had fallen onto them.

For a moment, I felt nothing. No fear, no anger - just a kind of supernatural stillness. The shapes beside me… they fit in all the ways they were supposed to. Like the way they did before the camping trip. Like in the way Lauren leaned slightly toward the sound of my breath. Like the way Alex always stood behind Ellie, comforting her in distressing situations. And yet, something about the symmetry - the doubling - made it all feel like a lie told too well. I didn’t know - I couldn’t know - which direction the truth was facing.

I looked back up at porch-Lauren, who had begun to take on the essence of something colder and sharper in her expression. Her gaze shifted between me and her counterpart, then to the kids standing behind her - and then to the kids in the car.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t run. She just stood there, hands shaking, resolutely against the impossibility, and said:

“They’re not coming inside.”

The other Lauren flinched. I felt it - the sharp, anxious breath she took through her teeth. Ellie gripped my sleeve tighter.

“Lauren…” I started, voice straining as the words felt like ash in my mouth. “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t think - I don’t know if they’re copies. Or.. or if something else happened. If they got lost-”

She shook her head.

Hard. Once.

That was all.

No words. No outburst. Just that one, solid refusal - and I understood what she meant. Some truths can’t be stretched. Some lines you just don’t cross, even if the world’s split clean down the middle.

The silence held - taught as a wire - until I spoke again.

“The guesthouse. They can stay there. Just for now. Until we figure this out.”

Porch-Lauren’s jaw tightened. She didn’t look at me. Her eyes stayed locked on her - the mirror version, now standing ten feet away in the flickering porch light.

“No,” she said, quietly.

“Lauren,” I said, softer still, pleading. “They can’t go back out there, in the forest. The kids - look at them. They’re just scared. Confused. Maybe we all are.”

She still didn’t look at me. But I saw her blink, considering my words. Then she stepped back into the doorway, her voice as brittle as glass.

“Fine. But they’re not coming in this house.”

She turned away and disappeared into the hallway, the screen door slapping shut behind her.

I stood in the gravel, heart thudding.

Behind me, Lauren - the other Lauren - let out a shaky breath. Ellie was still pressed against me. Alex said nothing at all.

“Come on,” I said, “It’s this way.”

We moved past the main house in silence, feet crunching over the gravel. I felt the presence of my other family still lingering behind the windows - watching. Or hiding. Maybe both.

The guesthouse sat at the back of the property, on the other side of our garden, half-covered in vines, paint peeling in the corners. It hadn’t been used in months.

I unlocked the door with the key hidden under the planter, and stepped inside, turning on the single ceiling bulb. The air was stale, and dust floated like soft static in the light rays.

“It’s not much,” I said, voice thin. “But at least you’ll have a roof over your head, while we figure things out.”

Lauren nodded, numb.

Alex sat down, heavily, on the couch and put his head in his hands. Ellie curled up next to him.

I stood there, hand still on the doorknob, not knowing which direction to turn.

*If they’re not real… then why does it feel like I’m abandoning them again?*

…

After much hesitation, I slept in the main house that night.

Lauren didn’t say anything when I came in. She was already in bed, facing the window, sheets pulled up over her shoulders. The room smelled of lavender and eucalyptus - the same diffuser as we’ve always used.

I didn’t bother showering. I just peeled off my clothes, and climbed in beside her. The mattress shifted under my weight. She didn’t move. Not an inch.

Her back was warm against my shoulder, her breathing steady.

I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling. I listened to her breaths.

*Inhale.*

*Pause.*

*Exhale.*

*Pause.*

*Repeat.*

They were perfect. Almost… too perfect. Rhythmic in a way that felt practiced - subtly stiff. Like she knew I was listening.

I tried to convince myself that was ridiculous, but I couldn’t stop.

I kept thinking about the other Lauren - curled up on the guesthouse couch, with a blanket wrapped around her knees, exhausted- but in a real way that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. The tremble in her voice. The weight of her hand on my shoulders.

And here, beside me, was a woman who knew all our inside jokes, our favorite recipes, the shape of my back, the ache in my knee from that old ladder fall.

But suddenly, I couldn’t remember the last time she had looked at me in the way guesthouse-Lauren had.

Not really, anyway.

Her breath hitched - just once. Maybe she felt me watching. Maybe she was just shifting in her sleep.

I closed my eyes and tried to match her rhythm. But it wasn’t until I started counting backward, that I realized I’d been holding my breath this whole time.

…

That night, I dreamt of the guesthouse.

It was warm.

Light spilled forth from every lamp, like poured amber. The air buzzed faintly with music - some old folk song, hazy and half-remembered, spilling from a radio that no longer worked. The walls were a different color, a sunny eggshell I didn’t recognize. The kind of color that made you feel safe.

Lauren brought out a platter of waffles and bacon, smiling wide. Ellie set the table, her cheeks pink with laughter. Alex leaned back in his chair mid-sentence, recounting some old story from school, with way too many detours. Everything shimmered with just the right kind of joy.

I ate without thinking.

I laughed when they laughed.

The windows were fogged from the heat, but the glass door - the one facing the main house - stayed clear. And at some point, without realizing when, I began to feel them.

Eyes on me.

Three figures.

Standing inside the house.

Watching.

I didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

But something made me glance up from my plate.

The lights in the main house were off.

In the hazy glow of indirect sunlight, by the window stood Lauren. Ellie. Alex.

Still. Expressionless. Perfectly visible through the window, as if they’d been there the whole time.

They didn’t wave. Didn’t knock. Just stared, faces flat and unreadable, like portraits hung behind glass.

Ellie’s hand was against the pane. Not pressed - just resting. Her breath left no fog.

Inside the guesthouse, laughter swelled again - Alex laughing too hard at a joke no-one told. Lauren refilling my glass, despite it being full to the brim. Ellie brushing crumbs onto my shirt with practiced, doting hands.

But I kept looking at the house.

At the three shapes inside it.

The guesthouse grew hotter, brighter. The air began to buzz louder, and that looping, familiar tune warped out of recognition.

I woke up with a start. No gasping. No sweat. Just the peculiar feeling - like something had been added to me while I slept.

Lauren was still beside me. Breathing steady. The same pattern as before.

But then I began to notice a hum, soft, almost below the threshold of sound. 

*Had it been there the whole time?*

…

I told myself I needed air. That was all. Just space. Just a few minutes away from the stiff, awkward silence of my bedroom.

I wandered down the steps to the guesthouse. The door was slightly open.

Inside: warmth.

It smelled like butter. Like browning toast and something just familiar enough to sting. Light spilled through the blinds in thin, golden slats, catching dust in the air like snow.

Lauren stood at the stove, barefoot. Humming something tuneless, but very much her own. Her hair was tied up in a loose bun - the way it used to be when the kids were still little. She didn’t look up.

“Didn’t think you’d be up yet,” she said.

“Didn’t sleep very well.”

She smiled, just faintly. “Felt like cooking.”

I stepped inside and saw the pan. Scrambled eggs. Bright yellow, just the way she used to make them. A half-handful of cheddar. Chives. No milk. She always said milk made them rubbery.

House-Lauren had been making them differently lately. A bit harder than I remember. A bit denser. Like she’d somehow forgotten the rhythm of it.

I sat. I ate.

They tasted right.

Everything felt just right.

I looked around. The guesthouse felt softer, somehow - as if the overnight presence of Lauren and the kids had made its spirit whole. The old mugs, which used to sit untouched on the shelf like forgotten props, now looked lived-in - well-loved. Ellie’s blanket, tucked gently under her chin as she slept curled on the couch, no longer looked like something we’d thrown in the guesthouse ‘just in case; - it looked like it had always belonged to her - smelling faintly of childhood and weekend morning cartoons.

Hesitantly, begrudgingly, I took slow steps, returning back to the main house. Alex had held my hand, asking me to stay longer, and I rustled his hair, promising I’d come back. 

The house felt colder. House-Lauren was just coming down the stairs as I slipped through the door, dressed and alert, but with that sort of washed-out look - like a painting left out in the sun for too long.

“You’re up early,” I said.

She glanced at me, then away. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“You hungry?” she asked, already halfway through the kitchen. “I could make eggs.”

I hesitated - way too long. There was a picture in my mind I couldn’t shake: the steam wafting off the plate in the guesthouse . The smell of browning butter. The way guesthouse-Lauren had sprinkled on extra chives just-so.

“I ate,” I said.

She paused. Her hand hovered just a moment too long on the fridge handle, before letting it fall.

“Right,” she said, softly. “Of course.”

She began cooking. Just with three fewer eggs than usual. One fewer slice of toast than usual.

From the hallway, I could hear Alex shifting in the living room, his chair creaking like an hold hinge. Not speaking. Just listening.

I lingered in the hall longer than I meant to.

The kettle clicked off behind her, but Lauren - House-Lauren - didn’t move right away. She was moving through the rhythm of breakfast - reaching for plates, twisting the burner on - but something about it felt unfamiliar. Just in the way a childhood song sounds when someone else hums it.

I kept my eyes on the floor, the table, the faint streaks of morning light that filtered in through the blinds. But I could feel her watching me in pieces. Never directly - glances from the corner of her eye as she moved.

I didn’t say anything.

And neither did she.

I moved to the living room, and switched on the desktop computer in the corner. I wasn’t even sure what I planned to do - any kind of work to make the hours pass.

House-Alex was curled at the far end of the couch, knees pulled up, a book open in his lap. But his eyes weren’t on the pages. They stayed fixed on the window - or maybe on the glass itself, where my reflection flickered with every shift and keystroke.

Each tap of my keyboard sounded too loud in the quiet room. Sharp. I could feel him listening to every press. I didn’t look at him, but I could feel his attention. Not accusing, just… watchful. And I thought of guesthouse-Alex. How easily he’d folded himself to my side, hand in mine. Of the way he’d smiled when I promised I’d be back.

Here, house-Alex just sat still. Like a photograph I wasn’t meant to touch.

…

Lunch was sandwiches. Soggy in the middle. Too much mayo.

We ate in silence. Alex listlessly scrolled his phone under the table. Ellie took hers apart bite by bite, crust first. Lauren barely touched hers.

I sat at the living room coffee table after, handling some bills and doing some accounting. Trying to work - or at least pretending to. My fingers stayed on the same lines of print for hours. The light shifted across the floor in slow bands, but never moved.

From where I was, I could see the guesthouse through the window. Just a sliver of it between the hedges. Nothing specific - just a corner of white siding, and the glint of sunlight off the glass.

I kept glancing at it. Unconsciously at first. Then with intention. The way you look at a shut door, when you’re waiting for someone to knock.

House-Lauren noticed. Of course she did.

By the thrd time she caught me looking, her hands slowed as she peeled carrots over the sink. She didn’t say anything.

By the fifth, she set her peeler down.

Dinner was almost ready when she finally spoke. Her back still to me.

“If you want to eat with them,” she said, voice even, “go. I don’t really care.”

I opened my mouth to protest. To explain. But there was nothing I could’ve said that didn’t sound like a complete lie. She wiped her hands on a dishtowel. Turned back to the stove.

“I’m not going to beg you to stay.”

…

I didn’t say anything when I left. House-Lauren kept cooking. House-Ellie locked herself up in her room. House-Alex stayed curled up on that couch, his eyes tracking my position as I tracked through the living room, and out into the garden.

The door to the guesthouse opened before I could knock.

Lauren was already setting the table - four plates, cloth napkins, charming old silverware. Like we used to do when the kids were little, and everything still felt worth the effort. The food was simple. Warm. steaming.

Alex and Ellie were already seated, talking softly about something. Not their day - nothing present-tense. It was a conversation pulled from some half-remembered Saturday, the kind that ends in laughter over nothing at all.

It didn’t feel like a trick.

It felt like being remembered.

I sat down. Ate. The way I hadn’t in weeks.

But at some point - between bites, between laughter - I glanced out the window. Toward the house.

They were there.

Lauren. Alex. Ellie.

Standing at the sliding door, backlit by the kitchen lights, not moving. Not speaking. Just watching. Their faces unreadable. Unmoving. 

For a long, flickering second, the air tasted like salt again.

No one at the guesthouse table noticed.

…

I told myself I’d just lie down for a minute after dinner. Just a moment, to clear my head. The couch still smelled like us — like the fabric softener she used, the cheap one we could never agree on.

I closed my eyes.

When I woke, it was light.

Too light.

I sat up, disoriented, throat dry.

The house across the lawn was still. No lights. No movement. I checked my phone.

8:42 a.m.

I walked up the path slow, stomach twisted. The front door was unlocked.

Inside, it was quiet.

Too quiet.

House-Ellie and house-Alex were still asleep, curled together on the couch like they’d drifted off watching TV.

But house-Lauren was gone.

On the desk by the hallway, something waited.

Two notes. 

The first was folded neatly into thirds. I opened it. It was in Lauren’s handwriting:

*""Alex,*

*I’ve gone to bring your father home.*

*Your real one.*

*Do not let the one here into the house.*

*Keep Ellie close.*

*Mom""*

Just like that. Not a goodbye. Not an explanation.

My chest felt tight, like something had been carved out without me noticing, and I was only now discovering the hollow. A metallic taste crept into my mouth.

And then I looked down again and saw it.

A second slip of paper, tucked beneath a cup.

It was creased. Worn. As if it had been carried around in someone’s pocket. Reread more than once.

The handwriting was mine.

My handwriting.

But I didn’t remember writing it.

And before I could stop myself, I was reading.

*""Lauren,*

*I’ve been watching the house from the treeline.*

*I see someone who looks like me inside.*

*He’s with you. With the kids. Living my life.*

*I don’t know who he is, or how this happened, but I remember everything. I remember Ellie’s birthmark behind her left knee. The way Alex used to cry when the radiator clicked on at night. I remember the night you lost your voice and still hummed to calm them both. He won’t get those right.*

*I’m scared that if I try anything, he’ll hurt you.*

*Please, if you believe me - meet me at the booth in the back of the coffee shop where we first met. I’ll be waiting.*

*Don’t let him in.*

*Don’t let him see this.*

*I love you.*

*Daniel""*

I stared at the letter, fingers cold around the edges.

My mind raced, but nothing landed. Thoughts skidded across the surface like stones on ice, never sinking deep enough to mean anything.

Suddenly -

Gravel crunched outside. A car door slammed.

The door swung open and she stood there, wind-tossed and flushed. A cold line of sweat down her temple. And behind her stood… him, hanging just a step back in the shade like a shadow pretending to wait its turn.

I stood from the little kitchen table.

“I knew it,” I said. “You were never real.”

Her mouth parted, brow creasing. “Daniel…”

“No. Don’t. Don’t use my name like you have any right to it.” My voice cracked and kept going. “I should’ve known. You’ve been different since the woods. Distant. Cold.”

The man behind her tilted his head.

“And now you’ve brought him?” I stepped forward, hands out, like I could physically keep them from entering. “What, is this a trade? Your real husband?”

Her face twisted. “You think I wanted this?”

“You brought him here!”

“Because I thought you weren’t real!” she snapped.

Silence.

Even he stilled.

Her voice dropped. “I waited. I waited for you. But something’s been wrong. I kept thinking… what if they got you instead? What if he was still out there, trying to get back?”

I shook my head.

“You really believe that?” I asked. “You really think I’d come back and… what? Forget how you like your coffee? Forget how Ellie always sleeps with one sock on? Just get it close enough?”

“You think I don’t see it?” she said. “You’ve been looking at them! Out there! In the guesthouse! Like they’re your real family… Like I’m the replacement.”

We stared at each other.

And then we both turned, slowly. To look at him.

He smiled, just a little.

And said nothing.

Then suddenly - the feeling of Ellie, pressing up against me.

I didn’t look down at first. Just let her cling to my side, small and trembling. Maybe she didn’t want to see us fight, I thought. Maybe it all scared her. Of course it would have.

I placed a hand on her back, gently.

“It’s okay,” I murmured, voice raw. “It’s gonna be okay.”

That’s when I felt it.

A sting, sharp and sudden, down near my thigh, like a needle slipping in sideways. I flinched, eyes darting down, and for a split second, I didn’t understand what I was looking at.

And then, something else.

A flicker.

Her shirt; it wasn’t the same one.

Not the faded cartoon one she’d been wearing on the couch. Not the one I’d carefully tucked the blanket around just that morning.

This was the other one.

The one guesthouse-Ellie had been wearing.

The cold came next. Blooming outward from the puncture.

I looked at her face. Sweet. Unblinking.

“I missed you, Daddy,” she said. 

But she wasn’t saying it to me.

And then everything started to tilt. The ceiling slid away like paper.

The last thing I saw before it all folded was house-Lauren, her eyes wide. Not with anger anymore, but horror. Recognition.

As we fell, she met my eyes.

My Lauren.

And then the dark came down, gentle and complete.

…

I woke to the low hum of the basement furnace.

Dim light filtered through the small slit of a ground-level window, dust dancing in the beam like ash suspended in amber. My leg pulsed dully in a distant ache. My back pressed against cool concrete, and beside me, warmth.

Lauren.

Her head rested against my shoulder, one hand curled lightly near my chest, as if she’d fallen asleep mid-reach.

Just beyond her, tucked beneath an old wool blanket, were Alex and Ellie. Curled together on a pile of stored winter coats, pale and still.

They hadn’t stirred.

I didn’t move at first. Just listened. The silence wasn’t total. Pipes creaked overhead, and somewhere far above, something akin to footsteps shifted. But down here, it was still.

Lauren stirred. Blinked.

Then looked at me.

“You’re still here,” she whispered, voice hoarse from sleep.

I nodded. “Didn’t have anywhere else to go.”

She sat up slowly, her eyes flicking past me toward the children. “They’re still out?”

“Whatever they gave us… it’ll wear off,” I said. “Eventually.”

She let out a breath - long and unsteady. “I thought I’d lost you again.”

“I thought I was the one being replaced,” I said quietly.

“We both did,” she murmured. “We were both so scared of being wrong.”

For a moment, neither of us spoke, as if allowing the squeaky pipes above to weigh in on our conversation.

Then she said:

“Looking back… the way Alex stared at you so intently - I think he knew. In his heart of hearts, I think he recognized you. Even when I couldn’t.”

I followed her gaze. Alex’s arm had fallen across Ellie protectively, fingers twitching now and then.

“I didn’t spend enough time with him,” I said. “Always focused on Ellie. She needed more help. Or maybe I just… didn’t know how to talk to a boy that age without screwing it up.”

“He never took it that way,” she said. “He looks up to you, Daniel. Even when he was scared, he watched you like he was waiting for something.”

“I thought he was just afraid.”

“He was,” she replied. “But not of you.”

I swallowed hard. My throat burned.

“I wanted to believe it wasn’t you,” she said. “Because if it was, then I’d have to admit I almost gave you up.”

“I wanted to believe you weren’t real,” I said. “Because if you were, then I’d have to admit I couldn’t tell. That I failed.”

“We were both fools.”

“Yeah,” I said. “But we’re still here.”

We sat in silence, the weight of everything unspoken thick around us. Just the four of us now; one family, stunned and quiet and still alive, as morning crept across the world above.

Just then, I heard a small, sharp inhale.

Alex stirred among the winter coats, face scrunching up as if trying to push the sleep out from behind his eyes.

“Dad?” he whispered.

I nodded. “Yeah, buddy?”

He looked to Lauren. Then to Ellie, who shifted in his arms a second later, rubbing her eyes and curling instinctively toward the sound of our voices.

Her voice was even smaller. “Are we home?”

I didn’t know how to answer that. But Lauren did.

“We’re together,” she said. “That’s what matters.”

Alex sat up. “They’re still here, aren’t they? The other ones?”

Lauren nodded grimly. “We’re not safe yet. But we will be.”

There was no grand declaration. No rousing speech. Just the quiet resolve that passes between people who have nothing left to lose.

We began to plan.

…

It was our seventh day down in the basement.  The bruises had faded. The cuts had scabbed. But the house was still wrong. Still watching.

Down in the basement, we ran through the routine one last time. Bags packed. Paths memorized.

Lauren adjusted the strap on Ellie’s backpack, her hands steady.

Alex looked to me. “We ready?”

I looked at all of them.

And nodded.

“Let’s go.”

The lock on the basement door gave a soft click, almost imperceptible, as the paperclip - one we managed to scrounge up among the basement clutter - twisted in Lauren’s shaking hands.

She let out the barest breath. Relief. Fear.

I pushed the door open an inch at a time, listening.

No footsteps.

We'd studied them for days - the rhythms above us, their routines. Their lives. We knew when the kitchen floor would creak, when they paused in the hallway to murmur just out of earshot.

Up the stairs. One by one.

We held our bags tight. Left the heavier things behind. One chance.

The hallway yawned ahead, quiet and dim.

We crept past the coat rack. Past the shoe mat. Every breath loud in my chest.

The front door waited, barely ten feet away.

I reached out.

Fingers touched the knob.

Turned.

I turned, just long enough to find Lauren’s hand behind me.

And then I felt it.

A sting. Low, sharp, buried near the hip.

Another.

Her breath caught - a thin gasp.

I spun.

Ellie stood behind me. And Alex. Pale. Wide-eyed. But wrong.

The way Alex’s shoulders sat. The way Ellie’s hair curled too neatly at the ends.

“Why?” I breathed. The cold was already spreading. ""Why would you-""

They said nothing.

Then, from the living room down the hall, a sound. Struggling. Wet cloth against duct tape.

And I saw them through the doorframe. Tied. Gagged. The real Alex. The real Ellie. Eyes wide. Desperate. Locked on mine.

Behind me, the others stood quietly.

And smiled.

I stumbled backward, eyes locked on the children — no, not children — things wearing my children’s faces. My legs felt hollow. Cold bloomed outward from the punctures like frost through old pipes.

And then he stepped into view.

From the living room. From behind the real children.

Me.

Or something wearing me just right.

Faux-Daniel's smile was gentle. Familiar. Off by half a second.

""Going somewhere?"" he asked.

Lauren moved before I could stop her.

She slammed her shoulder into me, drove me backward toward the door. I tried to catch her, but my limbs wouldn’t cooperate.

The door swung open behind me.

Light. Air. Cold and real.

“Run!” she screamed. Her voice cracked - desperate and raw - and she shoved again, hard.

I stumbled out onto the porch. The world tilted. My feet found gravel, then grass, then pavement.

Behind me, the door swung shut.

Just before it closed, I looked back.

He was there.

My double. Standing in the doorway, framed by the house light.

And Lauren. My Lauren - no longer screaming, no longer fighting - caught between them.

Then the latch clicked.

And I was alone.

Standing in the middle of the road, breath like fog in the night air, legs shaking.

…

I ran. Or tried to.

The cold in my limbs made everything feel distant, rubbery. I stumbled down the road, shoes slapping the wet pavement. Houses passed by like memories — flickering porch lights, curtains shifting.

I must’ve walked for hours.

Or minutes. Time bent strangely around me, refusing to settle.

Eventually, someone found me. An older man, maybe, or a teenager - I can’t remember exactly. They helped me into their truck, asked questions I couldn’t answer, dropped me off outside a 24-hour diner with a motel next door.

Now I’m here. In some dingy motel room, the walls thin enough to hear the neighbors arguing two doors down.

I haven’t slept.

I keep picturing Lauren’s face in that doorway. Her eyes when she pushed me. The look she gave me — not just desperate. Trusting. Like she believed I could fix this.

So I will.

Because if I don’t - if I leave them there, living out some mimicry of our life, with those things wearing our faces, then no one else ever will.

Because I saw the fear in Alex’s eyes. I heard Ellie’s muffled cries.

Because she chose me.

Because I’m still me.

I had once thought about driving straight to the sheriff’s office. Telling someone what had happened. But the more I played it out in my head, the clearer it became.

They weren’t hiding.

They were living. Shopping at the same grocery store. Answering the same phone. Taking the kids to school in my car, waving at the neighbors.

They had proof. Alibis. A full week of surveillance footage if anyone bothered to check.

I didn’t have anything. No wounds. No evidence of a struggle. Just a story that sounded like a breakdown.

And what if I did tell someone? What if the cops did come knocking?

What would stop them from opening the basement door… and finding it empty?

From smiling and saying, “There’s no one else here.”

From killing them and burying them in the time it took me to get a search warrant.

*How can they be dead*, they’d ask, smiling, *if they’re right here?*",2,1753554621.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I had parked just shy of the forestry gate, where the gravel thinned out, and the trees began thickening. From here, it was a few hours on foot - just enough time and distance to let the peacefulness settle in. That was all I really wanted - a little quiet. No reception, no chatter; just the trail ahead, and whatever passed for clarity in this day and age.

I left my phone in the glovebox. Not to make a statement as such - I just didn’t want to feel it buzzing in my pocket, needing, reminding.

The air smelled clean. Pine, crisp northern winds, and something familiar and damp, like the memory of water that had long since sunk into the ground. I slung my pack over one shoulder, and started walking, letting the rhythm pull me listlessly forward. There was just something calming about walking alone - neither too fast, nor too slow - exactly my own pace - that made me feel like I had a little more control over my life again.

The trees weren’t especially tall, leaning just slightly inward, as if they had something to confide in me - an innocent little secret between myself and the forest. The path wound forward, without promise or urgency. Late afternoon light filtered through the canopy like little threads of gold; slow dissolves, like a weary, introverted sun who had enough of being directly seen.

Time stretched ever forward, like a lazy cat, greeting its owner after a long, grueling day at work. After a while, I stopped walking in minutes, and began walking in distances-between-thoughts. 

I wasn’t exactly looking for anything. I wasn’t really running from anything either.

I told them I’d be back the next morning. Maybe a touch later. Just needed a breather, I said. They nodded - not dismissively, perhaps just- tired in their own ways. Maybe they were happy to have the house to themselves for a change.

It wasn’t always like this. We used to move like parts of the same body - not exactly perfect, but - close enough to feel whole. There was a sort of rhythm in the way we bickered, laughed, touched elbows at the dinner table.

And then came the camping trip, last month. What was meant to be a long weekend away in the mountains - a break from all the screens and internet. It happened suddenly. I went ahead to look for firewood, and they took a wrong turn trying to follow.

I found them again, a full week later.

They’d turned up some fifty miles north, by a reservoir I’d driven past some hundreds of times during my search. No injuries, no scratches, barely a clear story. Just tears and hugs and confused explanations. Something about getting turned around, following odd trails. 

It didn’t matter anymore, though. I had found them again.

But something had changed, subtly, after that. They were a touch quieter, somehow. Or maybe it was me. Maybe I’d stared at that empty tent for too long, whispering their names into the dark. Maybe I’d come too close to accepting the idea that they were gone forever.

We never really broached the subject. After the initial joy wore off, we just drifted back into routine. Work. School. House-chores. But somehow, things never quite clicked back into place. The pieces all looked the same - they still laughed at the same shows, still left dishes half-done in the sink, but - it still didn’t quite feel the same.

My son and daughter, Alex and Ellie, stopped asking me to read before bed. My wife, Lauren, started waking up before me, and taking long walks alone. Sometimes, I’d find them all together, sitting in the living room, discussing something that went quiet as soon as I entered. Not secretive - just… separate.

I never resented them for it. Nor did I feel especially left out. Mostly, it just felt like the threads that had tied us together had loosened, just a little. They were still mine, as far as I was concerned. Still loved me. But sometimes, when they laughed too hard at nothing I could hear - when they exchanged glances I couldn’t decipher, I’d catch myself thinking: these are the versions that came back.

And wondering if that was enough for me.

I must have walked for hours.

Not with purpose. Not really. Just following one trail after another, watching the way the sun filtered through the leaves, letting it all pull me deeper into the woods. A part of me was hoping I’d get tired. That I’d sit down somewhere and clear my head.

But I didn’t. I kept walking.

Past old logging stumps, crooked stone outcroppings, and mossy bridges, I kept thinking about home - how the house might feel right now. Quiet. Stretched thin. I imagined Lauren sitting at the kitchen table, flicking through her phone. Ellie and Alex squabbling in the other room, half-bored, half-wired from screen time. The little life we’d built together still buzzing along without me.

The sun kept sinking. The woods turned golden, then bronze, then something colder - all gray tree trunks and long blue shadows. I found myself on a ridge I didn’t recognize. The trail had thinned to little more than deer path.

I stood still for a while, watching the sun brush its last warmth across the trees.

The light had gone syrupy - thick and golden, oozing between the trunks like it was reluctant to leave. Shadows stretched long and crooked, flickering softly as the wind stirred the upper branches. A pair of birds darted overhead, trailing a thread of sound behind them that frayed and vanished into the stillness.

Everything felt paused, like the forest was holding its breath, waiting to see what I’d do.

I sighed. Adjusted the strap of my pack. And turned around.

Time to man up. Go back. Face the noise, the mess, the tight little world that waited for me.

I took the same path, weaving through underbrush in the reverse of my own trail. Branches snagged less this time. The air felt cooler. Quieter, too. Not dead, but subdued. The way it sometimes got before the evening birds started their songs.

Up ahead, I could just make out the turnoff that led toward the trailhead, toward the gravel lot where my truck waited. I pictured the climb down, the way the headlights would cut through the blue dusk. Maybe I’d stop somewhere on the drive back. Get Lauren’s favorite milk. Try to do something right. I stepped forward-

A voice. Low. Close.

“Daniel?”

I froze.

“Daniel — is that you?”

*Lauren?*

I turned.

The trees swayed gently.

“Please. I’m scared. I don’t know where I am.”

I stood at the edge of the trail, breath sharp in my throat.

“Daniel, please.”

Her voice again. Almost whimpering.

“I think I’m hurt.”

My mouth went dry. A strange urge to run. But it was her voice. Not just the sound — the cadence. That soft, uncertain rise she used to have when trying not to cry.

The one I hadn’t heard in years.

“Dad?”

Another voice. Higher. Cracking at the edges.

“Dad, where are you?”

Alex.

Then — barely a beat later:

“Daddy? I’m scared. Where are you?”

Ellie.

Her voice shook — the exact pitch she’d used when the power went out, when she was six and couldn’t find her nightlight.

My hands trembled.

Because I’d heard these voices before. But not like this. Not since before the camping trip.

Before they came home colder. Distant.

Smiling too tightly. Hugging too briefly.

Back when they still looked at me like I was theirs.

“Daniel?”

Lauren again. Just over the ridge.

“I’m here.”

The words escaped before I could stop them.

Then - the dry crunch of leaves underfoot. A rhythm. Getting closer.

I turned.

Three figures emerged from the brush - clothes torn, faces streaked with soot and dirt.

Lauren stumbled toward me. Then the kids. Ellie clinging to Alex’s arm, eyes wide with a desperate, aching kind of hope.

“Daniel,” Lauren whispered, voice cracking. “Oh my god - Daniel!”

She threw her arms around me. I caught her on reflex. Felt her weight, the tension in her limbs. She smelled like pine and smoke and sweat.

She smelled real.

The kids were next. Alex burying his face in my coat, Ellie’s arms locking tight around my ribs.

“We- we didn’t know where you went,” Lauren said. “Everything was strange. The trees… they kept changing. We thought…”

She pulled back. Studied my face.

“Are you okay?”

I wanted to say yes.

They felt solid. Familiar.

They clung to me like people who’d survived something unspeakable.

And for one trembling second, I almost believed.

But then, like a crack through glass:

*Weren’t they supposed to be home?*

I didn’t say it aloud, but I must have felt something was wrong. That subtle stiffness in my shoulders. The way my eyes kept flicking around without thought. The way I stayed one step behind them as we walked.

I told myself the only explanation that made sense - that they’d come out looking for me in the dead of night and gotten lost. The woods could twist and turn you without warning. Maybe they’d just wandered too far. Long enough to lose their bearings. Long enough to feel scared.

But something deeper disagreed. A quiet wrongness that wouldn’t settle.

Like stepping into a familiar room where everything’s been moved half an inch.

Your body notices, even if your mind can’t say why.

I couldn’t bring myself to ask. I was scared of their answer - scared of what it might mean. So I said nothing. Just led them toward the road.

We didn’t talk much on the way. They were exhausted. Ellie tripped twice, and I carried her for a while. Lauren kept glancing at me like she was afraid I’d vanish again if she looked away. I smiled each time, told her we’d figure everything out soon.

…

We reached the truck just before dusk. Lauren laughed, soft and dazed, when she saw it.

“You still drive this old thing?”

I nodded - not responding in words, unlocking the door.

Ellie fell asleep leaning against the window as soon as we pulled onto the road. Lauren held her hand. I kept both eyes on the stretching lines of the highway, stealing glances at my family every so often - just to make sure I wasn’t dreaming it all.

…

But of course, reality had to eventually come crashing down.

We pulled into the driveway just as the porch light came on. I killed the engine. The truck was filled with silence - the kind that comes right at the precipice of the irreversible.

For a second, I just sat there. One hand rested on the wheel. My reflection in the windshield betraying my apprehension back to me. Lauren stirred beside me. Ellie and Alex yawned in the back seat, stretching and blinking themselves awake.

Then the front door creaked open.

And Lauren - the other Lauren - stepped out onto the porch. My Lauren. At least, the Lauren that I’d kissed goodbye that morning. Her hair was still tied up from cooking, and she was wiping her hands off with a dish towel.

She smiled when she saw the truck. Familiar. Unbothered.

“You’re back early - do you want sup-”

Then she saw them. 

Her voice cut mid-syllable.

The dish towel fluttered down onto the gravel at her feet.

I could barely breathe - my hand on the cab door - stuck half open.

The other Lauren - the one in the car with me - had gone ghostly pale. Her eyes locked on the woman standing on the porch. Her mouth moved - once, twice - without any sound.

Ellie gripped my sleeve, whispering.

“Daddy?”

I didn’t answer. All I could see was Lauren looking at Lauren. My eyes filled with something beyond fear. The one question I'd dreaded the possibility of having to ask.

*If she’s here, at home… then who did I bring back?*

Porch-Lauren took a step back. Her eyes were locked on the woman beside me - the same face, the same eyes, the same trembling lips.

“Daniel…” she said, barely an audible whisper. “What is this?”

I glanced at her, and back at the Lauren next to me. Her hand rested, faintly, against the passenger-side door. She looked like she was on the edge of collapsing inward.

The words turned to ash in my mouth.

Porch-Lauren stood there, not crying, but tears streaming down her face nonetheless.

Porch-Alex’s hand had flown up to cover his mouth, and porch-Ellie held her head in her hands, whispering *no no no* to herself, backing toward the house like she could undo it all by stepping out of frame.

The ones beside me?

Frozen.

Staring.

Mouths agape.

As if struggling to comprehend the crushing weight of truth that had fallen onto them.

For a moment, I felt nothing. No fear, no anger - just a kind of supernatural stillness. The shapes beside me… they fit in all the ways they were supposed to. Like the way they did before the camping trip. Like in the way Lauren leaned slightly toward the sound of my breath. Like the way Alex always stood behind Ellie, comforting her in distressing situations. And yet, something about the symmetry - the doubling - made it all feel like a lie told too well. I didn’t know - I couldn’t know - which direction the truth was facing.

I looked back up at porch-Lauren, who had begun to take on the essence of something colder and sharper in her expression. Her gaze shifted between me and her counterpart, then to the kids standing behind her - and then to the kids in the car.

She didn’t scream. She didn’t run. She just stood there, hands shaking, resolutely against the impossibility, and said:

“They’re not coming inside.”

The other Lauren flinched. I felt it - the sharp, anxious breath she took through her teeth. Ellie gripped my sleeve tighter.

“Lauren…” I started, voice straining as the words felt like ash in my mouth. “I don’t know what’s happening. I don’t think - I don’t know if they’re copies. Or.. or if something else happened. If they got lost-”

She shook her head.

Hard. Once.

That was all.

No words. No outburst. Just that one, solid refusal - and I understood what she meant. Some truths can’t be stretched. Some lines you just don’t cross, even if the world’s split clean down the middle.

The silence held - taught as a wire - until I spoke again.

“The guesthouse. They can stay there. Just for now. Until we figure this out.”

Porch-Lauren’s jaw tightened. She didn’t look at me. Her eyes stayed locked on her - the mirror version, now standing ten feet away in the flickering porch light.

“No,” she said, quietly.

“Lauren,” I said, softer still, pleading. “They can’t go back out there, in the forest. The kids - look at them. They’re just scared. Confused. Maybe we all are.”

She still didn’t look at me. But I saw her blink, considering my words. Then she stepped back into the doorway, her voice as brittle as glass.

“Fine. But they’re not coming in this house.”

She turned away and disappeared into the hallway, the screen door slapping shut behind her.

I stood in the gravel, heart thudding.

Behind me, Lauren - the other Lauren - let out a shaky breath. Ellie was still pressed against me. Alex said nothing at all.

“Come on,” I said, “It’s this way.”

We moved past the main house in silence, feet crunching over the gravel. I felt the presence of my other family still lingering behind the windows - watching. Or hiding. Maybe both.

The guesthouse sat at the back of the property, on the other side of our garden, half-covered in vines, paint peeling in the corners. It hadn’t been used in months.

I unlocked the door with the key hidden under the planter, and stepped inside, turning on the single ceiling bulb. The air was stale, and dust floated like soft static in the light rays.

“It’s not much,” I said, voice thin. “But at least you’ll have a roof over your head, while we figure things out.”

Lauren nodded, numb.

Alex sat down, heavily, on the couch and put his head in his hands. Ellie curled up next to him.

I stood there, hand still on the doorknob, not knowing which direction to turn.

*If they’re not real… then why does it feel like I’m abandoning them again?*

…

After much hesitation, I slept in the main house that night.

Lauren didn’t say anything when I came in. She was already in bed, facing the window, sheets pulled up over her shoulders. The room smelled of lavender and eucalyptus - the same diffuser as we’ve always used.

I didn’t bother showering. I just peeled off my clothes, and climbed in beside her. The mattress shifted under my weight. She didn’t move. Not an inch.

Her back was warm against my shoulder, her breathing steady.

I lay there in the dark, staring at the ceiling. I listened to her breaths.

*Inhale.*

*Pause.*

*Exhale.*

*Pause.*

*Repeat.*

They were perfect. Almost… too perfect. Rhythmic in a way that felt practiced - subtly stiff. Like she knew I was listening.

I tried to convince myself that was ridiculous, but I couldn’t stop.

I kept thinking about the other Lauren - curled up on the guesthouse couch, with a blanket wrapped around her knees, exhausted- but in a real way that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. The tremble in her voice. The weight of her hand on my shoulders.

And here, beside me, was a woman who knew all our inside jokes, our favorite recipes, the shape of my back, the ache in my knee from that old ladder fall.

But suddenly, I couldn’t remember the last time she had looked at me in the way guesthouse-Lauren had.

Not really, anyway.

Her breath hitched - just once. Maybe she felt me watching. Maybe she was just shifting in her sleep.

I closed my eyes and tried to match her rhythm. But it wasn’t until I started counting backward, that I realized I’d been holding my breath this whole time.

…

That night, I dreamt of the guesthouse.

It was warm.

Light spilled forth from every lamp, like poured amber. The air buzzed faintly with music - some old folk song, hazy and half-remembered, spilling from a radio that no longer worked. The walls were a different color, a sunny eggshell I didn’t recognize. The kind of color that made you feel safe.

Lauren brought out a platter of waffles and bacon, smiling wide. Ellie set the table, her cheeks pink with laughter. Alex leaned back in his chair mid-sentence, recounting some old story from school, with way too many detours. Everything shimmered with just the right kind of joy.

I ate without thinking.

I laughed when they laughed.

The windows were fogged from the heat, but the glass door - the one facing the main house - stayed clear. And at some point, without realizing when, I began to feel them.

Eyes on me.

Three figures.

Standing inside the house.

Watching.

I didn’t move. Didn’t speak.

But something made me glance up from my plate.

The lights in the main house were off.

In the hazy glow of indirect sunlight, by the window stood Lauren. Ellie. Alex.

Still. Expressionless. Perfectly visible through the window, as if they’d been there the whole time.

They didn’t wave. Didn’t knock. Just stared, faces flat and unreadable, like portraits hung behind glass.

Ellie’s hand was against the pane. Not pressed - just resting. Her breath left no fog.

Inside the guesthouse, laughter swelled again - Alex laughing too hard at a joke no-one told. Lauren refilling my glass, despite it being full to the brim. Ellie brushing crumbs onto my shirt with practiced, doting hands.

But I kept looking at the house.

At the three shapes inside it.

The guesthouse grew hotter, brighter. The air began to buzz louder, and that looping, familiar tune warped out of recognition.

I woke up with a start. No gasping. No sweat. Just the peculiar feeling - like something had been added to me while I slept.

Lauren was still beside me. Breathing steady. The same pattern as before.

But then I began to notice a hum, soft, almost below the threshold of sound. 

*Had it been there the whole time?*

…

I told myself I needed air. That was all. Just space. Just a few minutes away from the stiff, awkward silence of my bedroom.

I wandered down the steps to the guesthouse. The door was slightly open.

Inside: warmth.

It smelled like butter. Like browning toast and something just familiar enough to sting. Light spilled through the blinds in thin, golden slats, catching dust in the air like snow.

Lauren stood at the stove, barefoot. Humming something tuneless, but very much her own. Her hair was tied up in a loose bun - the way it used to be when the kids were still little. She didn’t look up.

“Didn’t think you’d be up yet,” she said.

“Didn’t sleep very well.”

She smiled, just faintly. “Felt like cooking.”

I stepped inside and saw the pan. Scrambled eggs. Bright yellow, just the way she used to make them. A half-handful of cheddar. Chives. No milk. She always said milk made them rubbery.

House-Lauren had been making them differently lately. A bit harder than I remember. A bit denser. Like she’d somehow forgotten the rhythm of it.

I sat. I ate.

They tasted right.

Everything felt just right.

I looked around. The guesthouse felt softer, somehow - as if the overnight presence of Lauren and the kids had made its spirit whole. The old mugs, which used to sit untouched on the shelf like forgotten props, now looked lived-in - well-loved. Ellie’s blanket, tucked gently under her chin as she slept curled on the couch, no longer looked like something we’d thrown in the guesthouse ‘just in case; - it looked like it had always belonged to her - smelling faintly of childhood and weekend morning cartoons.

Hesitantly, begrudgingly, I took slow steps, returning back to the main house. Alex had held my hand, asking me to stay longer, and I rustled his hair, promising I’d come back. 

The house felt colder. House-Lauren was just coming down the stairs as I slipped through the door, dressed and alert, but with that sort of washed-out look - like a painting left out in the sun for too long.

“You’re up early,” I said.

She glanced at me, then away. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“You hungry?” she asked, already halfway through the kitchen. “I could make eggs.”

I hesitated - way too long. There was a picture in my mind I couldn’t shake: the steam wafting off the plate in the guesthouse . The smell of browning butter. The way guesthouse-Lauren had sprinkled on extra chives just-so.

“I ate,” I said.

She paused. Her hand hovered just a moment too long on the fridge handle, before letting it fall.

“Right,” she said, softly. “Of course.”

She began cooking. Just with three fewer eggs than usual. One fewer slice of toast than usual.

From the hallway, I could hear Alex shifting in the living room, his chair creaking like an hold hinge. Not speaking. Just listening.

I lingered in the hall longer than I meant to.

The kettle clicked off behind her, but Lauren - House-Lauren - didn’t move right away. She was moving through the rhythm of breakfast - reaching for plates, twisting the burner on - but something about it felt unfamiliar. Just in the way a childhood song sounds when someone else hums it.

I kept my eyes on the floor, the table, the faint streaks of morning light that filtered in through the blinds. But I could feel her watching me in pieces. Never directly - glances from the corner of her eye as she moved.

I didn’t say anything.

And neither did she.

I moved to the living room, and switched on the desktop computer in the corner. I wasn’t even sure what I planned to do - any kind of work to make the hours pass.

House-Alex was curled at the far end of the couch, knees pulled up, a book open in his lap. But his eyes weren’t on the pages. They stayed fixed on the window - or maybe on the glass itself, where my reflection flickered with every shift and keystroke.

Each tap of my keyboard sounded too loud in the quiet room. Sharp. I could feel him listening to every press. I didn’t look at him, but I could feel his attention. Not accusing, just… watchful. And I thought of guesthouse-Alex. How easily he’d folded himself to my side, hand in mine. Of the way he’d smiled when I promised I’d be back.

Here, house-Alex just sat still. Like a photograph I wasn’t meant to touch.

…

Lunch was sandwiches. Soggy in the middle. Too much mayo.

We ate in silence. Alex listlessly scrolled his phone under the table. Ellie took hers apart bite by bite, crust first. Lauren barely touched hers.

I sat at the living room coffee table after, handling some bills and doing some accounting. Trying to work - or at least pretending to. My fingers stayed on the same lines of print for hours. The light shifted across the floor in slow bands, but never moved.

From where I was, I could see the guesthouse through the window. Just a sliver of it between the hedges. Nothing specific - just a corner of white siding, and the glint of sunlight off the glass.

I kept glancing at it. Unconsciously at first. Then with intention. The way you look at a shut door, when you’re waiting for someone to knock.

House-Lauren noticed. Of course she did.

By the thrd time she caught me looking, her hands slowed as she peeled carrots over the sink. She didn’t say anything.

By the fifth, she set her peeler down.

Dinner was almost ready when she finally spoke. Her back still to me.

“If you want to eat with them,” she said, voice even, “go. I don’t really care.”

I opened my mouth to protest. To explain. But there was nothing I could’ve said that didn’t sound like a complete lie. She wiped her hands on a dishtowel. Turned back to the stove.

“I’m not going to beg you to stay.”

…

I didn’t say anything when I left. House-Lauren kept cooking. House-Ellie locked herself up in her room. House-Alex stayed curled up on that couch, his eyes tracking my position as I tracked through the living room, and out into the garden.

The door to the guesthouse opened before I could knock.

Lauren was already setting the table - four plates, cloth napkins, charming old silverware. Like we used to do when the kids were little, and everything still felt worth the effort. The food was simple. Warm. steaming.

Alex and Ellie were already seated, talking softly about something. Not their day - nothing present-tense. It was a conversation pulled from some half-remembered Saturday, the kind that ends in laughter over nothing at all.

It didn’t feel like a trick.

It felt like being remembered.

I sat down. Ate. The way I hadn’t in weeks.

But at some point - between bites, between laughter - I glanced out the window. Toward the house.

They were there.

Lauren. Alex. Ellie.

Standing at the sliding door, backlit by the kitchen lights, not moving. Not speaking. Just watching. Their faces unreadable. Unmoving. 

For a long, flickering second, the air tasted like salt again.

No one at the guesthouse table noticed.

…

I told myself I’d just lie down for a minute after dinner. Just a moment, to clear my head. The couch still smelled like us — like the fabric softener she used, the cheap one we could never agree on.

I closed my eyes.

When I woke, it was light.

Too light.

I sat up, disoriented, throat dry.

The house across the lawn was still. No lights. No movement. I checked my phone.

8:42 a.m.

I walked up the path slow, stomach twisted. The front door was unlocked.

Inside, it was quiet.

Too quiet.

House-Ellie and house-Alex were still asleep, curled together on the couch like they’d drifted off watching TV.

But house-Lauren was gone.

On the desk by the hallway, something waited.

Two notes. 

The first was folded neatly into thirds. I opened it. It was in Lauren’s handwriting:

*""Alex,*

*I’ve gone to bring your father home.*

*Your real one.*

*Do not let the one here into the house.*

*Keep Ellie close.*

*Mom""*

Just like that. Not a goodbye. Not an explanation.

My chest felt tight, like something had been carved out without me noticing, and I was only now discovering the hollow. A metallic taste crept into my mouth.

And then I looked down again and saw it.

A second slip of paper, tucked beneath a cup.

It was creased. Worn. As if it had been carried around in someone’s pocket. Reread more than once.

The handwriting was mine.

My handwriting.

But I didn’t remember writing it.

And before I could stop myself, I was reading.

*""Lauren,*

*I’ve been watching the house from the treeline.*

*I see someone who looks like me inside.*

*He’s with you. With the kids. Living my life.*

*I don’t know who he is, or how this happened, but I remember everything. I remember Ellie’s birthmark behind her left knee. The way Alex used to cry when the radiator clicked on at night. I remember the night you lost your voice and still hummed to calm them both. He won’t get those right.*

*I’m scared that if I try anything, he’ll hurt you.*

*Please, if you believe me - meet me at the booth in the back of the coffee shop where we first met. I’ll be waiting.*

*Don’t let him in.*

*Don’t let him see this.*

*I love you.*

*Daniel""*

I stared at the letter, fingers cold around the edges.

My mind raced, but nothing landed. Thoughts skidded across the surface like stones on ice, never sinking deep enough to mean anything.

Suddenly -

Gravel crunched outside. A car door slammed.

The door swung open and she stood there, wind-tossed and flushed. A cold line of sweat down her temple. And behind her stood… him, hanging just a step back in the shade like a shadow pretending to wait its turn.

I stood from the little kitchen table.

“I knew it,” I said. “You were never real.”

Her mouth parted, brow creasing. “Daniel…”

“No. Don’t. Don’t use my name like you have any right to it.” My voice cracked and kept going. “I should’ve known. You’ve been different since the woods. Distant. Cold.”

The man behind her tilted his head.

“And now you’ve brought him?” I stepped forward, hands out, like I could physically keep them from entering. “What, is this a trade? Your real husband?”

Her face twisted. “You think I wanted this?”

“You brought him here!”

“Because I thought you weren’t real!” she snapped.

Silence.

Even he stilled.

Her voice dropped. “I waited. I waited for you. But something’s been wrong. I kept thinking… what if they got you instead? What if he was still out there, trying to get back?”

I shook my head.

“You really believe that?” I asked. “You really think I’d come back and… what? Forget how you like your coffee? Forget how Ellie always sleeps with one sock on? Just get it close enough?”

“You think I don’t see it?” she said. “You’ve been looking at them! Out there! In the guesthouse! Like they’re your real family… Like I’m the replacement.”

We stared at each other.

And then we both turned, slowly. To look at him.

He smiled, just a little.

And said nothing.

Then suddenly - the feeling of Ellie, pressing up against me.

I didn’t look down at first. Just let her cling to my side, small and trembling. Maybe she didn’t want to see us fight, I thought. Maybe it all scared her. Of course it would have.

I placed a hand on her back, gently.

“It’s okay,” I murmured, voice raw. “It’s gonna be okay.”

That’s when I felt it.

A sting, sharp and sudden, down near my thigh, like a needle slipping in sideways. I flinched, eyes darting down, and for a split second, I didn’t understand what I was looking at.

And then, something else.

A flicker.

Her shirt; it wasn’t the same one.

Not the faded cartoon one she’d been wearing on the couch. Not the one I’d carefully tucked the blanket around just that morning.

This was the other one.

The one guesthouse-Ellie had been wearing.

The cold came next. Blooming outward from the puncture.

I looked at her face. Sweet. Unblinking.

“I missed you, Daddy,” she said. 

But she wasn’t saying it to me.

And then everything started to tilt. The ceiling slid away like paper.

The last thing I saw before it all folded was house-Lauren, her eyes wide. Not with anger anymore, but horror. Recognition.

As we fell, she met my eyes.

My Lauren.

And then the dark came down, gentle and complete.

…

I woke to the low hum of the basement furnace.

Dim light filtered through the small slit of a ground-level window, dust dancing in the beam like ash suspended in amber. My leg pulsed dully in a distant ache. My back pressed against cool concrete, and beside me, warmth.

Lauren.

Her head rested against my shoulder, one hand curled lightly near my chest, as if she’d fallen asleep mid-reach.

Just beyond her, tucked beneath an old wool blanket, were Alex and Ellie. Curled together on a pile of stored winter coats, pale and still.

They hadn’t stirred.

I didn’t move at first. Just listened. The silence wasn’t total. Pipes creaked overhead, and somewhere far above, something akin to footsteps shifted. But down here, it was still.

Lauren stirred. Blinked.

Then looked at me.

“You’re still here,” she whispered, voice hoarse from sleep.

I nodded. “Didn’t have anywhere else to go.”

She sat up slowly, her eyes flicking past me toward the children. “They’re still out?”

“Whatever they gave us… it’ll wear off,” I said. “Eventually.”

She let out a breath - long and unsteady. “I thought I’d lost you again.”

“I thought I was the one being replaced,” I said quietly.

“We both did,” she murmured. “We were both so scared of being wrong.”

For a moment, neither of us spoke, as if allowing the squeaky pipes above to weigh in on our conversation.

Then she said:

“Looking back… the way Alex stared at you so intently - I think he knew. In his heart of hearts, I think he recognized you. Even when I couldn’t.”

I followed her gaze. Alex’s arm had fallen across Ellie protectively, fingers twitching now and then.

“I didn’t spend enough time with him,” I said. “Always focused on Ellie. She needed more help. Or maybe I just… didn’t know how to talk to a boy that age without screwing it up.”

“He never took it that way,” she said. “He looks up to you, Daniel. Even when he was scared, he watched you like he was waiting for something.”

“I thought he was just afraid.”

“He was,” she replied. “But not of you.”

I swallowed hard. My throat burned.

“I wanted to believe it wasn’t you,” she said. “Because if it was, then I’d have to admit I almost gave you up.”

“I wanted to believe you weren’t real,” I said. “Because if you were, then I’d have to admit I couldn’t tell. That I failed.”

“We were both fools.”

“Yeah,” I said. “But we’re still here.”

We sat in silence, the weight of everything unspoken thick around us. Just the four of us now; one family, stunned and quiet and still alive, as morning crept across the world above.

Just then, I heard a small, sharp inhale.

Alex stirred among the winter coats, face scrunching up as if trying to push the sleep out from behind his eyes.

“Dad?” he whispered.

I nodded. “Yeah, buddy?”

He looked to Lauren. Then to Ellie, who shifted in his arms a second later, rubbing her eyes and curling instinctively toward the sound of our voices.

Her voice was even smaller. “Are we home?”

I didn’t know how to answer that. But Lauren did.

“We’re together,” she said. “That’s what matters.”

Alex sat up. “They’re still here, aren’t they? The other ones?”

Lauren nodded grimly. “We’re not safe yet. But we will be.”

There was no grand declaration. No rousing speech. Just the quiet resolve that passes between people who have nothing left to lose.

We began to plan.

…

It was our seventh day down in the basement.  The bruises had faded. The cuts had scabbed. But the house was still wrong. Still watching.

Down in the basement, we ran through the routine one last time. Bags packed. Paths memorized.

Lauren adjusted the strap on Ellie’s backpack, her hands steady.

Alex looked to me. “We ready?”

I looked at all of them.

And nodded.

“Let’s go.”

The lock on the basement door gave a soft click, almost imperceptible, as the paperclip - one we managed to scrounge up among the basement clutter - twisted in Lauren’s shaking hands.

She let out the barest breath. Relief. Fear.

I pushed the door open an inch at a time, listening.

No footsteps.

We'd studied them for days - the rhythms above us, their routines. Their lives. We knew when the kitchen floor would creak, when they paused in the hallway to murmur just out of earshot.

Up the stairs. One by one.

We held our bags tight. Left the heavier things behind. One chance.

The hallway yawned ahead, quiet and dim.

We crept past the coat rack. Past the shoe mat. Every breath loud in my chest.

The front door waited, barely ten feet away.

I reached out.

Fingers touched the knob.

Turned.

I turned, just long enough to find Lauren’s hand behind me.

And then I felt it.

A sting. Low, sharp, buried near the hip.

Another.

Her breath caught - a thin gasp.

I spun.

Ellie stood behind me. And Alex. Pale. Wide-eyed. But wrong.

The way Alex’s shoulders sat. The way Ellie’s hair curled too neatly at the ends.

“Why?” I breathed. The cold was already spreading. ""Why would you-""

They said nothing.

Then, from the living room down the hall, a sound. Struggling. Wet cloth against duct tape.

And I saw them through the doorframe. Tied. Gagged. The real Alex. The real Ellie. Eyes wide. Desperate. Locked on mine.

Behind me, the others stood quietly.

And smiled.

I stumbled backward, eyes locked on the children — no, not children — things wearing my children’s faces. My legs felt hollow. Cold bloomed outward from the punctures like frost through old pipes.

And then he stepped into view.

From the living room. From behind the real children.

Me.

Or something wearing me just right.

Faux-Daniel's smile was gentle. Familiar. Off by half a second.

""Going somewhere?"" he asked.

Lauren moved before I could stop her.

She slammed her shoulder into me, drove me backward toward the door. I tried to catch her, but my limbs wouldn’t cooperate.

The door swung open behind me.

Light. Air. Cold and real.

“Run!” she screamed. Her voice cracked - desperate and raw - and she shoved again, hard.

I stumbled out onto the porch. The world tilted. My feet found gravel, then grass, then pavement.

Behind me, the door swung shut.

Just before it closed, I looked back.

He was there.

My double. Standing in the doorway, framed by the house light.

And Lauren. My Lauren - no longer screaming, no longer fighting - caught between them.

Then the latch clicked.

And I was alone.

Standing in the middle of the road, breath like fog in the night air, legs shaking.

…

I ran. Or tried to.

The cold in my limbs made everything feel distant, rubbery. I stumbled down the road, shoes slapping the wet pavement. Houses passed by like memories — flickering porch lights, curtains shifting.

I must’ve walked for hours.

Or minutes. Time bent strangely around me, refusing to settle.

Eventually, someone found me. An older man, maybe, or a teenager - I can’t remember exactly. They helped me into their truck, asked questions I couldn’t answer, dropped me off outside a 24-hour diner with a motel next door.

Now I’m here. In some dingy motel room, the walls thin enough to hear the neighbors arguing two doors down.

I haven’t slept.

I keep picturing Lauren’s face in that doorway. Her eyes when she pushed me. The look she gave me — not just desperate. Trusting. Like she believed I could fix this.

So I will.

Because if I don’t - if I leave them there, living out some mimicry of our life, with those things wearing our faces, then no one else ever will.

Because I saw the fear in Alex’s eyes. I heard Ellie’s muffled cries.

Because she chose me.

Because I’m still me.

I had once thought about driving straight to the sheriff’s office. Telling someone what had happened. But the more I played it out in my head, the clearer it became.

They weren’t hiding.

They were living. Shopping at the same grocery store. Answering the same phone. Taking the kids to school in my car, waving at the neighbors.

They had proof. Alibis. A full week of surveillance footage if anyone bothered to check.

I didn’t have anything. No wounds. No evidence of a struggle. Just a story that sounded like a breakdown.

And what if I did tell someone? What if the cops did come knocking?

What would stop them from opening the basement door… and finding it empty?

From smiling and saying, “There’s no one else here.”

From killing them and burying them in the time it took me to get a search warrant.

1ma0g29,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1ma0g29/trip_report_7day_royal_princess_seattle_to_alaska/,Trip report: 7-day Royal Princess Seattle to Alaska,"Just finished up a 7-day round trip cruise from Seattle to Alaska on the Royal Princess and thought I’d share my experience:


Itinerary:

Alaska was a bucket list item for us, and a cruise was a great way to experience it. We got to see a bunch of wildlife and the majestic views of the wilderness. The itinerary beats a generic Caribbean cruise hands down. The excursions are expensive but worth it. 


Ship:

The Royal Princess felt older than say the MSC Seascape, but it was still well maintained. Stairs were narrow and awkward to navigate. There were many elevators and all worked well. There were a number of hot tubs and one pool on deck 16, but we didn’t use it because it was chilly. There were a good number of bars scattered throughout the ship. 


Stateroom:

We initially booked an interior, but we got lucky and won a bid for an obstructed balcony, $205pp. It actually was not obstructed at all. They just said that because the view directly below had a lifeboat. I highly recommend a balcony if you can, even an “obstructed” one. It’s worth having a private space, especially when you are cruising glacier bay and not fighting for room with the plebs. 


Food:

We ate in the MDR and buffet, no specialty dining. The food ranged from ok to delicious, and we always found something that we liked. Fish was overcooked in general. Lamb and beef were done well consistently. Service in MDR was average. Coffee in the buffet/MDR was hit or miss. Sometimes it tasted like water, and other times it was good. Desserts were extremely good. Make sure to pace yourself.


Drinks:

We didn’t get the drink package, but I had a Long Island and wife had Moscato. Pretty good, no complaints. I personally think the drink package shines when you’re in a hotter climate and can sit by the pool and get drinks. 


Service staff:

They did their jobs well and were friendly, but they had that dead inside look in their eyes. Not sure if it’s because they’re working an Alaska cruise where it’s colder or if they’re overworked and underpaid, but I didn’t get those vibes on MSC on their Caribbean itinerary. 


On board entertainment:

The shows without audience participation were ok in general but nothing to write home about. The magician on board was amazing though. I wasn’t expecting anything initially, but the stuff he pulled off was jaw dropping and A tier. The Voice of the Ocean was also another standout. There were some unbelievable singers among the guests on board. The naturalist and photographer talks were well worth it. The naturalist was very experienced and knowledgeable, and the photographer had some incredible videos and shots (he worked for nat geo and did gigs for Google). The activities such as quizzes and game shows that had audience participation were a riot. The activities staff did a great job of putting it together, and it was really entertaining. Highly recommend the yes/no game shows. 


Spa:

We purchased passes for the Enclave. Do it before the cruise, otherwise you have to pay gratuity for the pass. It’s worth it to have a sauna/steam room on a cold itinerary. They were clean and well maintained. Showering there was nice since they are huge, and stateroom showers are tiny. It was never really crowded. 


Casino:

I enjoy table games a lot, and I’ve also gambled aboard MSC. The casino is way too smoky and does not have enough ventilation. The odds for table games aren’t great. Hold’em doesn’t let you 4x pre flop, only 3x. Craps pass online odds are only 2x max. Casino staff vibes just felt tired and overworked. MSC casino floor and way better vibes even when you lost money, and that is tough to do. You also need to keep an eye on your bet. Craps dealers missed a number of bets, and there were 1-2 people fixing all their errors. Hold’em table had dealers misreading hands on occasion, but that was more rare. They have a clear points chart on how to gamble your way to a free cruise. I just do min bets on table games, so I was short 600 points. But it should be easy to hit a free interior if you gamble moderately. Overall, MSC has a better environment plus better odds, but it’s harder to hit a free cruise with MSC. 


Economics:

We like to save money where we can. Airport uber/port transfers were around $88 for two people one way. It’s easy to take the light rail from the airport to downtown and do a bus transfer to near the port. Then walk 10 minutes to the cruise port. You can do this if you’re traveling light. 

Drink package is up to personal preference, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you get free drinks in the casino. This is possible with some light table gaming. 

Don’t scrimp and save on excursions though. If you’re already in Alaska, you might as well enjoy it to the fullest. And wildlife and scenery is part of that. 



TDLR: We had an amazing time on Royal Princess. Even though the ship is a bit older, the itinerary, food, and activities are amazing enough that we didnt care the ship was older. 10/10 highly recommend.",3,1753554175.0,Cruise,2,0.71,False

GO vs BBE [Profitec Go, Niche Zero]","Well, Ive had my Go for way too long now and have been struggling to dial in and have tried near everything under the sun but always tasted wild or no flavor at all, never got good tasting coffee. I recently had some Lavazza from a friends Breville and it clicked that my espresso doesn’t even taste similar, doesn’t even taste like coffee. They let me borrow their machine.

I used my niche, TWW espresso water, the same Lavazza super crema, BBE NON double wall basket, and I could only fit like 14g in the double basket from the BBE when grinding direct from Niche (didn’t have funnel or any other accessories), but while dialing in a couple shots 14g in to 28g out anywhere between like 20s to 38s and it was all solid tasting. I then switched back to my GO trying to replicate and it is tasting nowhere close with all the same parameters. I’m worried that since it was my first machine I just went in circles for ages. 

I had contacted whole latte love this past week and they just suggested I do the barista assist zoom call, I’ll probably still go through with that for good measure but I’m pretty confident now something it up with my machine, since I dialed in on the BBE with literally zero effort.

Anyway, just wanted to share and see if anyone can see if I might be missing something obvious but I’m probably gonna try and send my GO back (I don’t want to sell if it’s broken) and have them check it out if possible and maybe just get a new machine. If it truly was the machine I’m bummed I’ve wasted ages thinking I couldn’t dial in and trying everything under the sun, but oh well, I’ve learned a lot on the way.",1,1753554129.0,espresso,11,1.0,False

Just landed in Delhi with nothing but ambition, a dangerous smile, and an unmatched talent for making your fries disappear when you're not looking. Fair warning: I'm equally skilled at making other things disappear too, like your ability to think straight when I'm close enough.

Finance by day, but my real expertise? Reading between the lines, stealing glances across crowded rooms, and turning innocent coffee dates into something that leaves you questioning everything you thought you knew about ""professional networking.""

**The fry stealing saga:** It starts innocent enough, one stolen fry, a mischievous grin, maybe our fingers brushing as you try to guard your plate. But here's the thing about playing with fire: once you let me get away with the first theft, you're already wondering what else I might take. Spoiler alert: I'm very, very good at taking what I want.

I'm looking for someone who can match my energy, bold enough to call me out when I reach for your fries, confident enough to steal them right back, and daring enough to see where this dangerous little game leads us. Think late-night drives through Delhi, conversations that start intellectual and end with you pressed against my car in some quiet corner of the city.

**What you can expect:** Intense eye contact, the kind of banter that makes your pulse quicken, hands that know exactly where to touch (starting with stealing your fries, but we both know it won't end there), and a connection that's equal parts mental and physical.

If you're ready to play a game where we both know the rules but pretend we don't, where stolen fries are just the beginning of what gets taken... slide into my DMs. Tell me your most dangerous confession, if you're brave enough. 

Delhi just got a lot more interesting.

I'm a 21 year old filo male living near the Hawthorne/Inglewood area. I'm just about 20 mins from DTLA/Manhattan Beach.

I’m still new to the area and would love to meet some new people, whether it's to link up, go on a coffee run, eat out, go out late I'm down for anything. Only have talked to the people at work, but I'm looking for people around my age that would match my energy and go on spontaneous adventures/ hangouts! Trying to connect with anyone, and would love to experience LA as much as possible with people also new to the area, OR those who have been here for awhile and would like to meet new people!

I want to experience things I haven't really done or couldn't do things back in Chicago. I want to feel like everyday I have done something new! From chilling somewhere and playing board games, watching shows, or talking for hours! to exploring the LA like hiking, beach trips, late night events! 

If anyone has tip/recommendations on the best ways meet new people or make friends lmk! Besides trying to initiate, being by yourself and approaching a group of people can be daunting/intimidating esp if it's only you and no one else yk. I genuinely enjoy meeting new people but only had deep conversations with the people at work, AND actually my Lyft drivers otw to work.

1ma0ett,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ma0ett/does_the_home_hero_french_press_coffee_maker_live/,Does the Home Hero French Press Coffee Maker Live Up to the Hype Review,"**Stylish Design with Practical Features**  
The Home Hero HHKA0107 French Press Coffee Maker immediately caught my eye with its sleek, modern design. The combination of the bamboo wood handle, black stainless steel accents, and crystal-clear borosilicate glass makes it a standout on any kitchen counter. I appreciate details like the ml/oz markings on the side, ensuring that precision meets aesthetics. This coffee press doesn’t just look good; it feels sturdy during use. The anti-slip silicone base is a small yet genius addition, keeping the coffee maker secure and counter surfaces scratch-free.

**Superior Coffee Filtration System**  
One of the highlights of this French press is the 4-layer filtration system. As someone who starts every morning with coffee, I noticed how smooth and grit-free the brews are. The system uses a combination of a coiled filter, two fine stainless steel mesh filters, and a metal cross plate. This combination traps all the coffee grounds, delivering a rich, flavorful cup. I’ve tried several French presses before, but very few managed to replicate this level of smoothness consistently. Keep in mind, though, the manufacturer recommends coarse ground coffee for the best results, which is something I had to adjust in my routine.  

[Check Home Hero HHKA0107 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d6b73b4w/)  

**Build Quality and Heat Retention**  
The heavy-duty borosilicate glass paired with stainless steel means durability isn’t a concern. Even though I’ve accidentally knocked it slightly, the heat-resistant glass didn’t flinch. The stainless steel frame is not just for aesthetics—it insulates fairly well, keeping my coffee warm for quite some time. I brewed a pot this morning and left it sitting for about 20 minutes, and the coffee was still warm enough to enjoy. It definitely outperforms cheaper French presses with thinner glass that cool down too fast.  

**Cleaning and Maintenance Made Easy**  
Cleaning is the part of coffee-making I hate, but this French press simplifies it. The glass canister and filtration system can go straight into the dishwasher, which saves me time. As for the bamboo wood handle and stainless steel frame, a quick hand rinse is enough to keep them looking pristine. I used soap and warm water on the bamboo, and it dried back to its original look—no warping or dulling after weeks of use. That being said, the dishwasher-safe parts were a lifesaver on hurried weekday mornings.  

**Positives**  
- The coffee maker’s sleek modern look enhances any kitchen’s appearance.  
- Coherent 4-layer filter system ensures grit-free, smooth coffee every time.  
- Heat retention outlasts many other French presses in similar price ranges.  
- Dishwashing the glass canister makes cleanup surprisingly quick.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The bamboo wood handle isn’t dishwasher safe.  
- Requires using coarse ground coffee for optimal performance.  
- The 34 oz capacity might not suffice for those hosting a group coffee session.  

**Competing Products**  
French presses like the Bodum Chambord or Secura Stainless Steel Press are strong contenders in the market. The Bodum Chambord has a simpler design and may fit those wanting a lighter, more traditional press. However, the Home Hero model’s layered filtration and heat insulation outperform the Chambord. Secura’s stainless steel build is nearly indestructible, but it lacks the visual appeal of bamboo and glass. Where rivals falter in combining style and performance, this one nails it.  

**Worth Every Penny**  
While the Home Hero HHKA0107 isn’t the cheapest French press out there, the features justify the investment. Between the premium materials, superior filtration, and thoughtful design, it delivers more value than many competitors. For avid coffee lovers or those upgrading from basic models, it’s genuinely worth considering.

1ma0ed4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlanWake/comments/1ma0ed4/a_possible_explanation_of_the_workings_of_the/,A Possible Explanation of the workings of the Shoebox and its Story Implications,"
*Spoilers : AW1, AW2, This House of Dreams, Control, Lake House*

It is a long read but I promise I have a point and I can’t shorten it much.

I had this sort of epiphany about the Shoebox. We now know for sure that This House of Dreams is canon. One of its poems gave me this idea. I’ll quote it.

————————

Poem 16

Inside this shoebox we killed for  
There is  
We don’t know what  
Neat stacks of hundred dollar bills  
Jewels like stars  
The dreams of those who’ve slept in this town  
The dream of this town (when we open it, the  dreamer will wake, and we, all part of his dream, will be gone)  
Our wishes come true  
The power to punch a hole into the universe  

Inside this shoebox we killed for  
There is  
A coffee thermos  
A flashlight  
A box of ammo  
Two pages of poems  
Countless wor(l)ds  

Inside this shoebox we killed for  
There is  
No cat, poisoned or otherwise, dead or living, undead, un-cat  
Baleful spirits  
All the evils of the world  
No hope  
Nothing  

Darkness 

————————

There is this repeated theme here of establishing what the shoebox could be, from something undefined, full of possibilities in the first stanza, then to game specific items in the second one, and finally Schrodingers box as well as Pandora’s box. The FBC also tried experimenting and found that contents of the shoebox are safe from effects of AWEs.

In AW1 Alan found, through the poems left behind in a shoebox in Bird Leg Cabin that Zane left something powerful in his original shoebox in case the darkness came back. We see a glimpse of the title of the same poems in the game, and we read excerpts of them in the blog, so I am taking that as confirmation that Zane left some poems behind too. Moreover those poems are likely the only ones that survived his rewriting of reality.

I don’t think Cynthia Weaver actually ever opened the Shoebox she was left to guard, she merely guarded it waiting for the next hero. So Alan opens it and finds the Clicker and the page explaining its significance. A lot of us took it as confirmation that Zane wrote Wake, but I don’t think it’s that simple. 

Whatever happens in AW1 was written by Alan while in the Dark Place before Diver Zane released him (also written by Alan), that includes him finding the Clicker, something that was significant to him. Not knowing anything about the force that is the Dark Presence, Alan could only draw from his own experience and Zane’s poems to make a coherent story solid enough to defeat it. He didn’t know what was in Cynthia’s Shoebox either, just that it was something Zane left behind. 

The reason I quote the poem is to draw your attention to its comparison with Schrödinger’s experiment, Pandora’s box and that opening the box means that the Dreamer will wake. In other words, the act of opening it solidifies the truth inside, while it is full of possibilities as long as it’s closed and you don’t know anything. Cynthia never opened it, no one alive knew what was in the box, even Old Gods didn’t because the Poet and the Muse never tells you what is in the box, just that you should find the Lady of the Light. 

So Alan, while writing this part, used this unknown to give himself and his story power. _He_ wrote the page about the Clicker, in his signature prose, and _he_ used his own childhood symbol of power to give it real power in the story. He wrote his own Deux Ex Machina as he himself called it. It worked because it has a strong emotional significance to him, was written in the dark place and formed a coherent narrative, and now the Clicker becomes the Object of Power we know it to be. 

We may perhaps never know what exactly Zane left in the box, perhaps that was the point. Possibilities hold immense power, we see an extension of this in AW2 itself, in the origin of the Dark Presence. It was unknown in AW1, it could keep tormenting him because he could never get any power over something so Eldritch, inhuman and undefined (as Barbara says “I am older than you boy, older than your first work of art, I will find a new face to wear, someone else to dream me free”). In AW2, Alan, with help and a whole lot of self discovery, was able to use this exact murkiness to his advantage and write a solid truth about the Dark Presence’s origin, thereby limiting it’s possibilities to something he could overcome.

Each time, the defeat comes from something deeply personal to Alan, though that specific analysis has already been done a lot of times. 

In conclusion, I think the Shoebox might hold the power of a mini Dark Place, of endless dreams and possibilities. It definitely puts it into a clearer perspective for me and projects it in a new light, it takes both the supernatural and personal aspects of the stories into account without diminishing either.

If you read so far, thank you. I would love to hear your thoughts.


PS. Think about the Bullet of Light, how even Alice used the shoebox, a picture of the bullet of light became a real bullet. This is Alice as an artist using the Shoebox in her way, through pictures instead of words.",9,1753554055.0,AlanWake,2,1.0,False
1ma0dss,https://www.reddit.com/r/WashingMachineReviews/comments/1ma0dss/could_arm_hammer_liquid_detergent_truly_tackle/,Could ARM & HAMMER Liquid Detergent Truly Tackle Tough Stains? In-Depth Review,"The ARM & HAMMER 033200002611 Plus OxiClean Clean Meadow Liquid Laundry Detergent is a product I recently integrated into my daily laundry routine. I approached it with a mix of curiosity and skepticism, considering its ambitious claim of offering “5 powerful cleaning benefits in 1.” Over the course of several weeks, I put this detergent through its paces in both standard and high-efficiency (HE) washing machines, tackling everything from kids' soccer uniforms caked with mud to delicate fabrics.

**Packaging and Design**  
The packaging is straightforward but practical. The well-sealed 100.5 fl oz bottle has a sturdy handle that prevents any awkward spilling, which is something I’ve had issues with in other liquid detergents. It’s worth noting that at 6.28 pounds, this isn’t the lightest detergent bottle, so maneuvering it might be cumbersome for some. However, the inclusion of clear dosage markings on the cap is a small but significant feature for portion control. This detail really came in handy for smaller loads.

**Cleaning Power and Performance**  
In terms of cleaning effectiveness, this detergent truly impressed me. After just a single wash, my white shirts seemed noticeably brighter, and stains like coffee and grass all but disappeared. It combines the stain-fighting properties of OxiClean with the trusted cleaning power of baking soda, and I could actually see it working its magic on stubborn spots. My favorite test case was my nephew’s ketchup-spattered sweatshirt. Just one cold-water cycle with this detergent, and it looked as good as new! On tougher stains, pre-treating with the detergent amplified the results, which surprised me in the best way.

[Check ARM & HAMMER 033200002611 price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0bbnbpqcl/)

**Scent and Freshness**  
Let me tell you about the scent—it's like stepping into a meadow on a breezy spring day. The Clean Meadow fragrance isn’t overpowering, which is perfect because I'm not a fan of laundry detergents that leave an artificial, cloying smell. Even days after washing, my wardrobe still carried a subtle freshness that every family member appreciated. This scent’s longevity earns it major brownie points in my book.

**Highlights**  
- Powerful stain-fighting capabilities, especially against food and grease stains.  
- Keeps both whites brighter and colors vibrant.  
- Compatible with all types of washing machines, including HE models.  
- The low-sudsing formula ensures it won’t clog HE sensors.  
- Infuses a long-lasting “clean meadow” scent into fabrics for added freshness.

**Negatives**  
- The bottle size might be unwieldy for smaller hands.  
- While potent for most stains, oil-based stains required a second round of treatment.  
- Doesn’t offer a biodegradable bottle option, which would be a big plus for eco-conscious consumers.

**Energy Efficiency and Versatility**  
One standout feature is its effective performance in cold water, reducing energy consumption, which aligns with my efforts to be a more eco-friendly consumer. It’s also phosphate-free, ammonia-free, and bleach-free, which makes it gentler on the skin and on the environment, not to mention safer for those with allergies. That said, the lack of a hypoallergenic variant might make some folks hesitant if their household has sensitive skin.

**Competing Products**  
This detergent has some stiff competition in the liquid laundry detergent space. Tide Pods are often praised for their convenience, but I find ARM & HAMMER better suited for heavier loads due to its concentrated formula and ability to pretreat stains. Persil ProClean stands out for stain removal but falls short in fragrance longevity as compared to this product. Seventh Generation’s natural detergents offer greater environmental friendliness, but they don’t always tackle tough stains as effectively. While ARM & HAMMER might not check off all eco-friendly boxes, its cleaning power and balanced fragrance give it an edge over others.

**Budget-Friendly**  
Price-wise, I think this product punches above its weight class. It has the cleaning chops of higher-end brands while still being affordable, which makes it an excellent choice for households on a budget. Given that one bottle lasts for 77 medium loads, the cost per load is reasonable, and it holds its own even against pricier options on the market. To my mind, this product represents good financial value without cutting corners on functionality or effectiveness.

It’s the first one I’ve done since September last year, and previously I’ve only done 2 pieces so it’s nice to come back to it. (Hopefully properly now!)

Mind you, that’s about a full week earlier than her cycle normally is. I’m fairly sure she’s just putting that out there to immediately squelch any “expectations” (spoiler: I have ZERO expectations).

She was nice enough to let me sleep in, make me breakfast, and bring me my coffee in bed. Can’t really complain, just a small vent.",10,1753553848.0,DeadBedrooms,6,0.81,False
1ma0ahg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ma0ahg,An Open Letter To The NIMBY’s of Belfort Street,"Oftentimes, when I think of Portland, I think of home. I think of fresh spring days and cold winters. I think of Rose Foods and Coveside Coffee. I think of happiness- happiness from 27 years of life in which I’ve had the chance to learn and grow in this wonderful city. But I also think of sadness. Sadness in the rising housing costs. The lack of affordability. Sadness for those less fortunate than me, who are forced to call the parks and sidewalks of downtown home. Sadness that there is so much pain in a community that shines so brightly.

Lately, I’ve been riding my bike more. It started a few weeks ago when my mother asked if I’d like to join her for a small ride up Lane Avenue and back. Of course, I said yes. We made it to the top of the street and then turned around to head home. The next day, we made it down to Gerald Talbot Elementary and back. Eventually, after a few days of this loop, it became too easy, and I wanted to go a little farther. So I crossed over onto Belfort Street.

For those unaware, last year the city of Portland proposed building a 50-unit, three-story housing development on the wooded property between Gerald Talbot Elementary and Belfort Street, called Belfort Landing. It passed on July 7th and is expected to begin construction either this year or next.

To state it plainly- the amount of NIMBYism I’ve seen on my rides through Belfort Street is appalling. Signs on nearly every lawn claim the proposal isn’t “responsible development.” Outward complaints say the building is “too big” and “not a right fit” for the community. That there will be too much traffic… on an offshoot street from Forest Ave? I live three streets down. There’s already plenty of traffic- I don’t think one more building at the top of your street is going to ruin your commute.
I have a hard time believing this neighborhood full of large, expensive, single-family homes truly believes the development is simply “irresponsible.” But I don’t like to assume.

What I do know is that Portland needs growth. I’ve believed this for years, and I will continue to believe it until we either change our ways as a community and welcome the growth opportunities we are provided- or until we crumble under the weight of our hubris. Communities like that of Belfort Street don’t seek to move our city forward. They seek to preserve their safe little bubble of large homes and manicured lawns. They want to surround themselves with fellow homeowners. How dare we let “renters” into our community.

My message to the people of Belfort Street is simple: I hope you enjoy your new neighbors. I hope that every time you ride past Belfort Landing on your commute to work, you’re met with friendly smiles and pleasant “good mornings.” I hope you know that every time I’m riding my bike through your neighborhood, I’m laughing at you- and that I can’t wait until construction is complete. Hopefully, it will be the beginning of easing the weight of our city’s housing crisis.

I’m sorry you feel that being part of the solution is such a burden on your neighborhood. Like it or not, you live here too.

1ma08ux,https://www.reddit.com/r/probabilitytheory/comments/1ma08ux/free_will/,Free Will,"I've been learning about independent and non-independent events, and I'm trying to connect that with real-world behavior. Both types of events follow the **Law of Large Numbers**, meaning that as the number of trials increases, the observed frequencies tend to converge to the expected probabilities.

This got me thinking: does this imply that outcomes—even in everyday decisions—stabilize over time into predictable ratios?

For example, suppose someone chooses between tea and coffee each morning. Over the course of 1,000 days, we might find that they drink tea 60% of the time and coffee 40%. In the next 1,000 days, that ratio might remain fairly stable. So even though it seems like they freely choose each day, their long-term behavior still forms a consistent pattern.

If that ratio changes, we could apply a **rate of change** to model and potentially predict future behavior. Similarly, with something like diabetes prevalence, we could analyze the year-over-year percentage change and even model the **rate of change of that change** to project future trends.

So my question is: if long-run behavior aligns with probabilistic patterns so well ( a **single outcome** can't be precisely predicted, a **small group of outcomes** will still reflect the overall pattern, does that mean no free will?

I actually got this idea while watching a Veritasium video and i'm just a 15yr old kid (link : [https://www.youtube.com/live/KZeIEiBrT\_w](https://www.youtube.com/live/KZeIEiBrT_w) ), so I might be completely off here. Just thought it was a fascinating connection between probability theory and everyday life.",1,1753553685.0,probabilitytheory,4,0.67,False
