Anyone Faced Similar Situations?,"So here‚Äôs the thing. I usually don‚Äôt mind helping out someone who looks like they‚Äôre genuinely struggling. If I have a bit of extra cash on me, I am happy to give. At the end of the day, if their story is fake or they use the money for something else, that is on them, not me. I gave it with good intentions. Usually, I will give about Rs.500 at most.

But what really annoys me is when helping someone turns into an uncomfortable and borderline harassing experience. Instead of walking away thinking ""I did a good thing,"" I end up thinking ""Why won‚Äôt this bugger just leave me alone?""

Two experiences stand out clearly in my mind.

Beggar or Scammer Number One (During COVID)
This guy looked genuinely desperate. He even told me he would clean my house if needed. He really seemed like he needed help, so I gave him Rs.2000. Just to be clear, he didn't clean my hosue. 
Turns out he lived nearby, and every time I saw him after that, it was one sad story after another. One day he even asked me for Rs.10000.
Gone were the days of offering to work. He just expected handouts. I wanted to confront him and tell him not to talk to me again, but I left town for work.
When I came back, it was like he had no memory of me at all.

Beggar or Scammer Number Two (Today)
I was walking into Fab and it was boiling hot outside. I was super thirsty and noticed a beggar who looked like he was really suffering in the heat.
I walked up and asked if I could get him something to drink. I expected him to ask for a water bottle. Instead, he asked for iced coffee. Fine, fair enough.
Then he said he needed three. One for him and two for his brothers. I sighed but agreed to it. My salary had just come in so I was feeling generous.

When I came out with the iced coffees, he asked if I could give him Rs.3000 for his younger brother‚Äôs school shoes. I didn‚Äôt have any cash on me, so I showed him my empty wallet.
Then he asked me if I could go to the bank and withdraw money. I said I was in a rush, but he kept pushing.
He said ""Aiyo, can‚Äôt you help me just a little more?"" I was thinking bro, I just bought you three iced coffees.

Then he asked for one more small favour. He wanted another iced coffee for his mother. I was already losing patience, but I still did it.
As I was walking away, he asked again if I could go to the ATM. I told him no and started leaving. And then he hit me with a guilt trip, saying ""Wow, I can‚Äôt believe you won‚Äôt help me out.""

I just wanted to help someone out who was clearly struggling in the heat, and I walked away feeling completely drained and used.

A well-organized backpack will help you stay efficient and prevent items from getting lost or damaged.

Comfort is essential, especially if you plan to carry the backpack for extended periods.Padded shoulder straps are a must, and adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit to your body.

While functionality is important,the style and aesthetics of the backpack are also key considerations for women.

Have you ever wondered why the Japanese and Chinese are very healthy, plus they live for a longer period than others and age gracefully?

This is because they drink Green Tea regularly during their day. They consume Green Tea after meals, while having meals, whilst taking a break, as a pick me up, to relax and for many more daily requirements.

# So what is the best time to drink¬†[Ceylon green tea](https://mabrocteas.com/blog/what-is-the-best-time-to-drink-green-tea/)?

# During and after meals

Fatty foods that contain large amounts of fat is one of the main causes of obesity and weight gain , Green tea washes down the fat in the intestines as it is a hot liquid. Furthermore it accelerates the digestion process in the stomach by breaking down food particles faster.

# During work

Green Tea is a known brain stimulant and boosts its functions. Therefore consumption during a work day will be beneficial to any executive. It has just the right amount of caffeine that keeps you alert without causing the jittery effects of too much of caffeine. Another important compound in Green Tea that aids this befit is called L-Theanine. This compound which is an amino acid is known to cross the blood-brain barrier.

# Whilst studying

L- Theanine is reported to have less caffeine and gives a milder buzz than coffee. Research and focus groups have confirmed that their focus & productivity is stable when compared to coffee.

# After meals as a digestive aid

If you search for any weight loss supplements chances are Green Tea will be one of the ingredients used in it. This is because Green Tea increases the metabolism in the body and promotes fat burning.

# As a healthy daily drink

Green tea has powerful antioxidants¬†that may help in reducing damage caused to cells. it also has bioactive compounds that protect the brain against neuro-degenerative illnesses such as dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs.

# To protect your teeth

The catechins in Green Tea is known to be beneficial to oral health. This is due to the antibacterial properties prevalent in it. The bacteria is the main cause of tooth delay & plaque formation. Green Tea maintains a clean mouth and promotes oral health.

**Most importantly!**¬†Make sure to refrain from consuming Green Tea on an empty stomach, this is because it promotes digestion thereby amplifying your digestive juices. If taken on an empty stomach this might cause gastric reflux or acid reflux.

Green tea is a variety of tea made from the very same plant that gives us Black Tea. The plants scientific name is¬†*Camellia Sinensis*. It‚Äôs the manufacture methods that make it have the unique characteristics Green Tea offers. There are mainly 2 methods of manufacture. The first is the Chinese method which pan fry‚Äôs the Tea leaves for a period of time and the second is the Japanese method which steams the Tea leaves during manufacture. For a laymen the Tea once manufactured might look identical but the taste, brew/cup color and infusion has distinctive characteristics that are unique to one another.

Green Tea has a plethora of benefits to the human body as it contains many medicinal properties in it. Tea is generally rich in polyphenols and furthermore Green¬†tea contains a catechin called¬†epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Catechins are natural antioxidants that help prevent cell damage and provide many other benefits. These substances can reduce the formation of free radicals in the body, protecting cells and molecules from damage. These free radicals play a role in aging and many types of diseases.

EGCG is one of the most powerful compounds in green tea. Research has tested its ability to help treat various diseases. It appears to be one of the main compounds that gives green tea its medicinal properties

To enjoy green Tea one must prepare the tea properly. Green Tea requires a different preparation method as to Black Tea. Green Tea is brewed at 80C which is water that‚Äôs below boiling. Simply bring water to a boil and set aside for 1-2 mins. This is due to the Green Tea leaves burning if boiling water is poured into it. The leaves are not toasted and fired like that of Black Teas.

Typically I will wake up between 5am and 5:30amIt's starting to really hurt my day to day performance in work and hobbies. 

I'm not sure what started it. But I can tell you the following context:

* I don't drink alcohol
* I don't consume nicotine
* I drink 3 cups of coffee starting 1 hour 30 mins after waking (1 hour 30 mins after my previously usual waking time of 7am) and stop at midday
* I go for a 20 minute walk every morning to get sunlight
* I get into bed at about 10:15pm. I don't use any screens for the last hour before bed. Before I sleep I will read a novel 
* I am not suffering from depression or anxiety (I do feel tired and moody from the lack of sleep though) 
* I took ashwagandha for 2 weeks before bed before this started and stopped after a week of experiencing this sleep issue as I believed this could have been the cause
* I take the following supplements: Lion's Mane, Creatine, Zinc, Vitamin D, Magnesium - daily or once every few days
* I typically get at least 1 hour of daylight everyday
* I lift weights twice a week and play sport or cardio once or twice a week. I also get around 15-20k steps a day
* I don't consider myself to be stressed. In fact, on the handful of days after a good sleep I've felt great! Which makes it all the more frustrating that I'm not sleeping well. 
* I also track my sleep using my fitbit. 
* I have tried melatonin, didn't help. I have no issue falling asleep whatsoever. 
* When I wake up at 5:30am, I feel WIDE awake. More so than I have ever typically felt. 
* I typically sleep about 8 hours rather than the current 6.5-7. 

  
I've tried considering what caused me to sleep better on those few nights. One factor is I was with my partner (we don't live together atm). I've never found being in the same bed as them to have a strong corelation to my sleep quality/quantity until now. Another factor might be that when I do spend the night with them we tend to stay up a little later - maybe I will go to bed between 11-11:30pm. However, I have also had that late night on my own and experienced no later wake up time. 

I will be attempting three things tonight:

1. Going to bed later at 11:15pm

2. Not wearing my fitbit in case tracking my sleep score is causing stress. 

  
Because I have no issue falling asleep, and I feel WIDE awake upon waking, I'm starting to think my issue is to do with the cortisol release in morning. If anyone has experienced this or can offer any help, not only will I be very grateful, but I will buy you something from your Amazon Wish List and send you a handwritten personal thank you card to your location anywhere in the world expressing my thanks for your help. 

  
TLDR: I wake up at 5:30am everyday (too early). I have good sleep habits. I will buy you something from your Amazon Wish List and write you a thank you letter if you can help. ",1,1745567643.0,sleep,0,1.0,False

I worked as many hours as I could, saved up and bought an investment property for my father in September 2020 ($238K - $7200 stamp duty, no LMI). I continued my saving adventure and saved to buy another house in November 2021 ($568K - INCLUSIVE of stamp $20K and LMI $8K).

I rent my father's house for $300pw (the median rent in that area is $575 as of April, 2025 but he's my dad and I want him to travel more and enjoy his last 15 years or so - he's 75 years young) and I WAS renting my first property for $590pw (the median rent in that area was $650).

In January 2025, I had $250K left on my first house ($460pw repayments), $170K on my father's house ($280pw repayments) and $430K on the last house I bought (my primary residence - $701pw repayments). 

I sold my first house for $660K AFTER ALL EXPENSES (including real estate fees, conveyancing, repainting, staging and other bits and pieces).

With the money left over, I paid off the first house loan and my primary residence mortgage too (I actually put it all in the offset account so I pay no interest on that mortgage but have instant access to the funds). The rest of the cash, I invested $120K into VGS @$123.50 per share (I had savings too)

My thought process was: I have been SOOO extremely frugal, at 39, when do I ever experience things like; eating out, take away coffee, shopping for things that I don't need but I want like new outfits etc. I never EVER treated myself... is my point. 

I work FIFO now and the fitter on site and I got into it. He has 5 properties, interest only... the whole sha-bang of waiting till he is 50 to cash in etc. My argument was that I didn't want the financial burden anymore. I wanted the freedom to give a job I hated the middle finger if I wanted to. My dad's rent is set to cover the loan almost dollar for dollar. 

Reddit says property wins long term but holy moly I couldn't care less anymore. I understand now that working a career you enjoy is important for mental health, saving FIFO money I can work 3-5 months of the year at shutdowns while there are no outgoings with a 12% average growth to VGS occurs in the background. I prefer now to travel and dress nice, even perhaps drive a nice car.

Anyways, the board was beyond saving so I bought one of those replacement boards on AliExpress to give myself a fun little project. I just finished installing the board and getting it wired up properly, but the picture is quite wonky. I plugged in a SNES and was surprised to see that there are bulges and lines in the picture. I've done a bit of research and I think this could simply be caused by electrical interference (I'm not an electrical engineer, but am sort of competent with this kind of stuff).  
  
Note that the back of the TV is currently open and I haven't tidied up the wires yet because I won't have access to the necessary gear until I'm back at work on Monday. Just wondering if anyone else has come across this before?

Another time, I saw a crafter make beautiful jewelry out of recycled plastic bottles. The way they transformed a common waste item into a stunning piece of wearable art was truly inspiring.

Maybe you‚Äôve got a big event coming up, or you‚Äôre just tired of feeling sluggish. But here‚Äôs the catch: most ""fast"" weight loss methods backfire. You drop pounds, then they creep right back. Frustrating, right?

I‚Äôve been there. Years ago, I tried a juice cleanse that left me hangry and exhausted. Spoiler: It didn‚Äôt work. What¬†*did*¬†work? Science-backed strategies that actually fit into real life.

In this guide, we‚Äôll cut through the noise and focus on¬†**fast, sustainable weight loss**‚Äîno gimmicks, no starvation. Just proven methods that help you shed fat while keeping energy (and sanity) intact.

# 1. The Truth About Fast Weight Loss

# Why Most Quick Fixes Fail

Ever notice how crash diets make you obsessed with food? That‚Äôs your brain fighting starvation mode. Extreme calorie slashing slows your metabolism, making future weight loss harder.

**What works instead?**

* **A modest calorie deficit**¬†(500‚Äì750 calories/day) for steady fat loss.
* **Macro balance**‚Äîenough protein to preserve muscle, smart carbs for energy, healthy fats for hormones.

**Fun fact:**¬†A 2020 study in¬†*The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition*¬†found that people who lost weight gradually kept it off longer than rapid losers. Slow and steady¬†*does*¬†win the race.

# 2. The Best Eating Plans for Rapid (But Smart) Results

# Option 1: The Low-Carb Reset

**How it works:**¬†Cutting refined carbs and sugar lowers insulin, a fat-storage hormone.

**What to eat:**

* Eggs, salmon, chicken thighs (yes, thighs‚Äîthey‚Äôre juicier!).
* Avocados, olive oil, nuts‚Äîfats that keep you full.
* Non-starchy veggies (think zucchini, spinach, broccoli).

**Personal tip:**¬†I swapped pasta for spiralized zucchini‚Äîgame changer. Top it with pesto and grilled shrimp. You won‚Äôt miss the carbs.

# Option 2: Intermittent Fasting‚ÄîFlexible and Effective

**Try the 16:8 method:**¬†Eat between 12 PM‚Äì8 PM, fast the rest.

**Why it works:**

* Gives your digestion a break.
* May boost human growth hormone (hello, fat burning).

**Pro tip:**¬†Start with 12 hours (8 PM‚Äì8 AM), then gradually extend. Black coffee and herbal tea are fasting-friendly.

# Option 3: Protein-Powered Meals

**Science says:**¬†Protein increases thermogenesis (you burn calories digesting it!) and curbs cravings.

**My go-to high-protein snacks:**

* Greek yogurt with berries.
* A hard-boiled egg with Everything Bagel seasoning.
* Turkey roll-ups with hummus.

# 3. Workouts That Actually Burn Fat (No Marathon Sessions Needed)

# HIIT: The 20-Minute Fat Torcher

**Example workout:**

1. 40 seconds jumping squats (feel the burn!).
2. 20 seconds rest.
3. Repeat with push-ups, burpees, mountain climbers.

**Why it‚Äôs magic:**¬†Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) means you burn calories¬†*after*¬†the workout.

# Strength Training: Because Muscle = Metabolism

**Myth busted:**¬†Lifting weights won‚Äôt make you bulky. It‚Äôll make you leaner.

**Best moves:**

* Deadlifts (start light‚Äîform is key!).
* Dumbbell rows (bye-bye, back fat).
* Glute bridges (for a perkier posterior).

**Personal story:**¬†I used to skip weights for cardio. Big mistake. Adding strength sessions helped me lose inches faster than hours on the treadmill.

# 4. The Secret Weapons No One Talks About

# Sleep: The Unsung Hero of Weight Loss

**Fact:**¬†Just one night of poor sleep spikes ghrelin (hunger hormone) by 15%.

**Fix it:**

* Dim lights by 9 PM.
* Try magnesium glycinate before bed (no grogginess!).

# Stress Less, Weigh Less

**Cortisol = belly fat‚Äôs best friend.**

**Quick de-stressors:**

* 5-minute box breathing (inhale 4 sec, hold 4, exhale 4).
* A walk outside‚Äîno phone, just nature.

# Hydration Hacks

**Before meals:**¬†Drink 16 oz of water. One study found this simple trick led to¬†**44% more weight loss**¬†over 12 weeks.

**Infuse your water:**¬†Cucumber + mint or lemon + ginger for flavor without calories.

# 5. Mistakes That‚Äôll Sabotage Your Progress

# Mistake 1: Obsessing Over the Scale

**Better metrics:**

* How your jeans fit.
* Energy levels (can you sprint up stairs without wheezing?).

# Mistake 2: Cutting All Carbs

**Smart swaps:**

* White rice ‚Üí cauliflower rice (saut√© it with garlic‚Äîyum).
* Potato chips ‚Üí roasted seaweed snacks.

# Mistake 3: Ignoring Non-Exercise Activity

**NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) matters more than you think.**

**Boost it:**

* Pace during phone calls.
* Take the scenic route to the bathroom.

# The Bottom Line: Fast Weight Loss That Lasts

Losing weight quickly¬†*can*¬†be healthy‚Äîif you do it right. Ditch the deprivation, focus on¬†**nutrient-dense foods, efficient workouts, and stress management**, and the results will follow.

**Your challenge this week:**

1. Pick¬†*one*¬†strategy from this guide (maybe HIIT or doubling your water intake).
2. Commit to it for 7 days.
3. Notice how you feel‚Äîlighter? More energized? That‚Äôs progress.

Remember, your body isn‚Äôt a problem to solve. It‚Äôs a partner in this journey. Treat it well, and it‚Äôll return the favor.

# Discover the Best Lux Candle: 2025 Expert Reviews & Top Picks

The pursuit of creating a serene and inviting atmosphere within our homes has lead to a surge in the popularity of luxurious candles. More than just a source of light, these candles serve as a sensory experience, appealing to our sense of smell and sight.

## Key Features Analysis

the key to a truly extraordinary lux candle lies in a harmonious blend of premium ingredients,meticulous craftsmanship,and an aesthetically pleasing design. the following features distinguish the best from the rest.

**Wax Composition**

the type of wax used in a lux candle substantially impacts its performance and longevity. Premium candles typically employ natural waxes such as soy, beeswax, or coconut wax. These waxes burn cleaner and longer than paraffin wax, which is a petroleum byproduct. Furthermore, natural waxes tend to hold fragrance better, resulting in a more consistent and immersive scent experience.**Fragrance Profile**

The fragrance is the heart and soul of any lux candle. The finest candles utilize high-quality fragrance oils or essential oils to create complex and nuanced scent profiles. These fragrances are carefully crafted to evoke specific moods or transport you to different places. The complexity of the scent, the balance of top, middle, and base notes, and the overall intensity all contribute to the candle's overall appeal.

**Wick Material**

The wick plays a vital role in the candle's burn performance. Premium lux candles typically feature natural fiber wicks, such as cotton or wood. These wicks are chosen for their ability to burn evenly and cleanly, without producing excessive smoke or soot. The size and type of wick are carefully selected to complement the wax composition and fragrance load, ensuring a consistent and controlled burn.

**Vessel Design**

The vessel that houses the candle is an integral part of the overall aesthetic. Lux candles are often presented in elegant and elegant vessels made from materials such as glass, ceramic, or metal. The design of the vessel can range from minimalist and modern to ornate and traditional, reflecting the candle's overall style and target audience.

Key features of the best lux candles include:

*   A blend of natural waxes such as soy, coconut, or beeswax, ensuring a clean and long-lasting burn.
*   Intricate and layered aroma profiles developed with high-quality fragrance or essential oils.
*   Natural-fiber wicks such as cotton or wood, carefully chosen for clean and even burning with minimal smoke.
*   Elegant and aesthetically pleasing vessels crafted from premium materials, enhancing the candle's overall presentation.

## Core Benefits

Investing in a lux candle provides benefits that extend far beyond simply illuminating a space.

**Enhanced Ambiance**

A lux candle can transform the ambiance of a room, creating a warm, inviting, and relaxing atmosphere. The soft glow of the flame, combined with a carefully curated scent, can instantly set the mood for relaxation, romance, or socializing. Whether you're unwinding after a long day or hosting a gathering, a lux candle can elevate the overall experience.

**Stress Reduction**

Certain fragrances,such as lavender,chamomile,and sandalwood,are known for their calming and stress-reducing properties. Lighting a lux candle infused with these scents can help to ease anxiety, promote relaxation, and improve sleep quality. The act of lighting a candle and taking a few moments to breathe in the aroma can be a simple yet effective way to unwind and de-stress.

**Elevated Home Decor**

A lux candle is not just a source of fragrance; it's also a decorative accessory that can enhance the style of your home. The elegant vessels in which these candles are housed can complement your existing decor and add a touch of sophistication to any room. Whether displayed on a coffee table, bookshelf, or mantelpiece, a lux candle can serve as a stylish and eye-catching accent.

**Improved Air Quality**

Unlike paraffin candles, which release harmful chemicals into the air when burned, lux candles made with natural waxes are a healthier option for your home. Natural waxes burn cleaner and produce minimal soot and smoke, making them a safer choice for people with sensitivities or allergies. By choosing a lux candle made with natural ingredients, you can enjoy the benefits of fragrance without compromising your indoor air quality.

## FAQs Section

**How long does a typical lux candle burn?**
The burn time of a lux candle varies depending on the size of the candle, the type of wax used, and the fragrance load. Generally, a high-quality lux candle can burn for anywhere between 40 and 100 hours. Proper candle care, such as trimming the wick regularly and avoiding drafts, can help to maximize burn time.

**What are the best scents for relaxation and sleep?**

Scents like lavender, chamomile, sandalwood, and vanilla are frequently enough recommended for their calming and sleep-promoting properties. These scents have been shown to reduce anxiety, lower heart rate, and promote relaxation, making them ideal for creating a soothing bedtime routine.

**Are lux candles safe for people with allergies and sensitivities?**
While lux candles made with natural waxes are generally safer than paraffin candles, it's significant to check the ingredients list for any potential allergens or irritants. Some fragrance oils or essential oils may cause reactions in sensitive individuals. If you have allergies or sensitivities, look for candles that are specifically labeled as hypoallergenic or fragrance-free.**How can I maximize the lifespan of my lux candle?**

To maximize the lifespan of your lux candle, always trim the wick to 1/4 inch before each burn. This will prevent smoking and ensure a clean, even burn.Avoid burning the candle for more than 4 hours at a time, as this can cause the wax to overheat and shorten the burn time.Keep the candle away from drafts and flammable materials. allow the wax to melt entirely to the edges of the vessel during each burn to prevent tunneling.

Benefits i saw then were- 
Joint pains gone,
Steady energy,
and Good sleep

I was however younger, so didn‚Äôt really value these benefits as much. About a year and a half after quitting i got introduced to speciality coffees, roasts, pour overs what have you by a couple of friends, I completely changed sides, I‚Äôd obsessively wait for that weekly coffee that came with dramatic insomnia, jitters and acidity. I‚Äôd brave it for the high.  I slowly started having one super strong coffee a day, sleep wasn‚Äôt bad etc, always looked forward to it. I took the acidity for granted, also the increasing aches. Lurking in this community made me rethink my addiction- especially since i am a woman in her early forties - i know a host of maladies await me anyway (sorry for the gloom, but perimenopause sucks). I had a tummy bug recently and cut down the amount of coffee i was having for the past couple of days. Anxiety and acidity have dropped for sure, of course headaches, lethargy and some bit of insomnia is there (younger me slept through the withdrawal - had the other symptoms of course), I also have a little pressure in my ears (always happens when my coffee is delayed).
Anyway this is me committing to give it up and update this post. This is one love i must bid adieu to. Weekly cheats etc. don‚Äôt work for me sadly as the dysregulation it sets in messes with me for a while.
P.S i am already on meds for hypothyroid, mild insulin resistance and hypertension, so the nutrient/mineral leaching that coffee does just adds to whatever loss these meds cause- hence the need to cut back.

Starting -

In a land where dawn breaks with golden grace,
Kashmir's peaks adorned by the morning's embrace,
Whispers of snow on cedar's ancient crown,
Serene valleys where rivers gently drown.
Dal lake's beauty bestows heavenly sight
For its elegance is called the land of paradise

From Punjab's fields, rich and wide,
Harvests sing beneath the sky so wide.
Gurbani‚Äôs hymns, a soulful, sacred sound,
A land of warmth, where hearts abound.
Lassi sweet and hearts so strong,
In Punjab's soul, you can't go wrong.

Delhi's heart beats, ancient and new,
Red Fort's grandeur, a majestic view.
Qutub Minar's height, a timeless sight,
Chandni Chowk's buzz, a colorful night.

Northeast whispers in emerald groves,
Where beauty in seven sisters roves. Mizoram's hills, Nagaland's pride,
Assam's tea gardens, rivers wide.
Manipuri dances, stories old,
Legends of courage, tales of gold.
Meghalaya‚Äôs clouds embrace the green,
With living bridges, a sight serene.
Assam‚Äôs tea in rolling plains,
Majuli‚Äôs charm where culture reigns.
Tripura‚Äôs palaces, stories old,
Agartala‚Äôs grace in hues of gold.

Westward now, where deserts glow, Rajasthan's sands in a golden flow.
Palaces painted in marigold hues,
Legends of Rajput valor still true.
Each grain of Pink City echoes stories of grace
From royalty to historical tales
In Gujarat, kites kisses the sun,
Navratri echoes as dancers run.
Dhol beats calling hearts to dance, Garba steps in a festive trance


Chhattisgarh hums in forest deep,
Tribal songs in rivers leap.
Jharkhand‚Äôs mines with riches bright,
Hidden gems in dawn‚Äôs soft light.

Oh, Bengal, where rivers weave tales,
Ganges whispers to the jute sails.
Durga's hymn in autumn's embrace,
Art in every street , glamour in every face. Poets sing of love and strife,
In Kolkata's heartbeat, there's life.
Odisha sings to the Jagannath beat,
Puri's waves in a rhythmic feat.
Temples ancient, carved with care,
Spiritual journeys in sacred air.

Maharashtra rises with tales untold,
Where forts whisper of Maratha gold.
Mumbai dreams beneath the stars,
In bustling streets, in cinema's heart.
In Telangana, echoes rise,
Where Charminar touches sapphire skies.
Andhra‚Äôs shores in waves of grace,
Tirupati's light, a sacred place.

Journey down to South India, where temples rise high,
In Tamil Nadu, their grandeur reaches for the sky.
Kerala‚Äôs backwaters, serene and green,
Houseboats glide, a peaceful scene.
Kathakali‚Äôs dance, a dramatic art,
A land of spices , a soulful start.
Coffee , coconut, rains so wise,
God's own country under blue skies.

Different tongues, yet hearts are same,
In unity, burns a sacred flame.
So, let the world, in wonder see,
The soul of India, pure and free
India, oh tapestry vast,
Every corner, echoes of the past.
Weaving traditions, colors bold, Stories ancient, yet never old

29M here. 

Background:

- East Asian descent, but from Canada (born and raised).

- No history of family colorectal cancer; just benign polyps found in my Dad and Aunt‚Äôs colon. 

Been having on-off rectal bleeding, primarily on my toilet paper after bowel movements since November 2020. When a bleeding episode starts, it would stay no longer than 1-2 days, and most recently, only stayed for one bowel movement. When the episode halts, I would say I don‚Äôt get any bleeding for anywhere from 6 months to 8 months, and then it would happen again. 

Of the episodes I‚Äôve experienced, they have always been red (crimson, not fresh) blood, and had appeared in the toilet bowl twice (and also on the toilet paper at the same time). I never inspected my actual stool if it contained blood, because I was too scared and wanted to flush quickly. But, they always appear on the toilet paper.

I always assumed because it was red (and not dark), and because there was never any pain, straining, or constipation that it was internal hemorrhoids, so I didn‚Äôt visit a doctor (stupid, I know). Fast forward to exactly 5 weeks ago, after finishing a bowel movement, I wiped, and saw (from what I remember), a darker / purplish, thick amount of blood (maybe like half a tablespoon amount) on the toilet paper. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a clot, but all I know is the blood looked more viscous, and darker (nothing like burgundy, probably lighter and purply). When I saw the new colour, I immediately freaked out, and scheduled an appointment with my GI. He performed a digital rectal exam and an anoscopy, and said he didn‚Äôt see anything. He also indicated, given I had been intermittently bleeding for nearly 4.5 years, I would have been dead by now / seriously ill if it was cancer. As a safe measure, and just in case, he referred me for a flexible sigmoidoscopy in a couple of months, which he believes will be negative. He also doesn‚Äôt think a colonoscopy is necessary, if negative.

I am freaking out that the GI doctor was unable to find anything. I was hoping he would find something (like internal hemorrhoids) that would be responsible for my bleeding during the anoscopy. I am now terrified it is the Big C, and have been experiencing crippling worries since that day, 5 weeks ago.

Prior to my darker blood episode, aside from bleeding, I don‚Äôt recall having any noticeable symptoms. When I eat spicy food (like spicy noodles), I would have a stomach ache and possibly mild diarrhea that night, which I assume is normal. 

Because of the nature of my occupation (office worker), I have a sedentary lifestyle, and my hobbies usually entail sitting at home, and playing video games. Prior to the dark blood episode, I would say I don‚Äôt drink much water (just one extra large cup of coffee a day, and that would usually be it in terms of liquids; maybe a sip or two of water if I was really thirsty that day). I also rarely ate fruits & vegetables, so I would say my diet was also not the greatest. When going on the toilet, my legs often go numb because I like taking my time on the toilet. With all these factors, I reasonably assumed it was hemorrhoids. 

To date, I haven‚Äôt experienced any bleeding since. I changed my diet significantly (lots of fiber, water, fruits, veggies). I noticed I am a lot gassier, which I attributed to this diet. I make one healthy bowel movement in a day, and it comes out smooth, with no straining. 

After the episode 5 weeks ago, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my health anxiety causing these symptoms, but I‚Äôve had the following: Excess flatulence, squeezing feeling around throat (comes and goes), random muscle spasms in arms, hot and cold sensations over belly & back, burning sensation in stomach, right above navel (new, today, which seemed to feel better right after eating), and this horrible ‚Äúflu-like‚Äù feeling of lightheadedness, shakiness, feeling hot, and general malaise (happened once and lasted for a few hours, hasn‚Äôt happened since). I feel like I get these symptoms, which alternate each day, at random, and comes and goes. It‚Äôs so frustrating, but I feel like I‚Äôm dying.

Would appreciate if people could provide support, thoughts, and their experiences with a darker blood episode like mine, which ended up benign.

Joined first job as a PLC software engineer after my graduation, kind of by accident. The company was an automation solutions provider, but somehow I not even get near to do any programming here. Instead, I was posted outstation 80% of the time for machine validation. Due to client policies, automation lines built by vendor A must be tested by vendor B to prevent fraud, and I am the vendor B here. Work is worthless, read instruction, execute instruction, tick on the box...

I quit after 8 months and landed my current job at a Japanese MNC manufacturing plant. I was more careful in my selection this time. The job is rather quite chill compared to others. Basically no OT, no on-call, no shift work, barely only 5% outstation and most of it is supporting our overseas plants. 

But somehow‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm burnt out again. It might sound funny, but this time the culture burnt me out.  Micromanagement here is next-level. **--->Everything<---**  is controlled here. Let me list some example, they control your standing posture, sitting posture, hand posture, hair length, hair color. This is individual control. Office wise, your screen must be landscape and perfectly parallel to your desk by the end of the day, no orientation of screen allow, no coffee on desk, no calender, no notebook, nothing. The desk must be completely clean and only laptop is allow. And all these just administrative side, I would skip the politic side...  


So yeah. I‚Äôm burnt out again.  
For for past 2 years I had been casually browsing and interviewing for better oppotunity and most of the time I can get offer immediately, but almost all of them require either 24/7 on call, or night shift, or frequent outstation...the common issue from PLC.

So I started self-learning software development along the way. I have a degree in mechatronics background, so it wasn‚Äôt too hard to get started.

I found her outside and slightly emaciated at around 5-6 months old. She refused to leave after I found her and is terrified of going outside so she‚Äôs an indoor only kitty now. She was fixed shortly after I found her and she‚Äôs otherwise healthy. 

She has always had an issue with chewing on things. She chews on cords (ours have chew proof covers, but she‚Äôll occasionally try to chew them), papers, bags, the couch, blankets, my shoes, the coffee table, chairs, the scratching post, the cat wheel, and literally anything else she can reach if she wants food. She seems to think it will get her what she wants. She will literally stare at me and chew on these things until she gets my attention and then she stops and first yells at me (she‚Äôs loud) and then hides the second I say ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù.  She seems to know that she shouldn‚Äôt chew on those things and only chews on them about 2 hours till food time. 

We do not nor have we ever rewarded this behavior. When she does this, she goes in time out (we put her in the bathroom for 10-15 minutes, she doesn‚Äôt like being alone and it always makes her stop this behavior), otherwise she just finds something else to destroy. This is why she hides btw, she doesn‚Äôt like being in a different room than us and she knows what ‚Äútimeout‚Äù means. We have tried ignoring this behavior, for several months, but it only made it worse. She gets fed twice a day at exact times and she gets plenty of food, she‚Äôs honestly a little chunky (she isn‚Äôt as big as the last picture makes her seem, I SWEAR) so she isn‚Äôt starving but from the way she acts, you‚Äôd think she was. 

We have also tried re-directing her behavior with various toys. She has silvervine sticks, three different kinds of cat dental toys, rope toys, chew sticks with silvervine and gallfruit, Earth Animal No Hide Stix, and tons of other toys. She also has four different automatic interactive toys; a laser pointer, a mouse that moves, an interactive ball that rolls around and chirps, and two different bird toys that chirp. I also play with her daily until she‚Äôs tired so I honestly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs boredom. 

As a final note, we‚Äôre always feed her exactly on time, despite her efforts to sway us. However, sometimes she gets particularly angry and will flick her tail hard while staring at us and then intentionally attacks one of the other two cats (they have never provoked her). This only happens when it‚Äôs within 2 hours of food time and only after we‚Äôve already told her ‚Äúno‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù. 

Also, she cannot be free fed. We‚Äôve tried several times. She will eat all of it at once as if she has never been fed before. She‚Äôs also otherwise a very cuddly, loving cat. She sleeps on the bed with us all night (I have insomnia and wake up frequently, she‚Äôs always there), she cuddles with me throughout the day and purrs very loudly, she even uses her paw to gently pat my face if I‚Äôm not looking at her or petting her while she‚Äôs on my lap, and she gives me gentle little nose licks, overall she‚Äôs usually a very sweet and loving baby, I‚Äôm just not sure how to correct this behavior.

Question: Why wont this question be approved here?

Answer:

1- It's asked multiple times a day.  Many people that have gotten an answer via DM still submit it as a question... It's mind boggling

So here's the correct answer publicly:

**Nobody but an official from DCAS can tell you when the scores will be posted.**

There are no members here from DCAS so anything, anyone including myself tells you is just an educated guess or ""I heard from my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"" which in the grand scheme of things doesn't do anything for you.

Right now their are way too many Variables. It usually takes about 6 months+ to establish a list.  
There's protest sessions to protest questions, Invites need to be sent out for that, you guys get to attend. If a question gets thrown out the list gets curved which can change everyone's placement on the list.  
There's veterans that are contacting HQ to have their points added to their scores before the list is established that takes time also.

7001 I believe took either a year or more to get their scores (I'm sure someone will correct me there).  
So Keeping it short and going by the idea of 5-6 Months from the end of the exam period Keep in mind their are exams still being given, I thought it had closed and just saw that someone got an email to reschedule their appointment for the exam new appointment dates are available as of April 24th 2025... so lets say they close the exam May 9th because I highly doubt they will do anything less than 2 weeks for a testing window

Add 5-6 months to May and we're looking at possibly October w November as the latest.  
**\*\* However this does not align with the academy schedule \*\***

My original estimate\*\* followed the 5-6 month post exam date for a list and would also follow the academy schedule along with rumors of a final extension for 7001. Which placed you guys getting a list established late September to mid October latest, 7001 going in for 1 last class in October 2025 along 4528.

4044 gets notice in Sept / October starts processing immediately...  
Most people take about a year to year and a half to process fully from CPAT to Academy Swear in date.  
Lets imagine that a select few line up perfectly for a process that takes 5 Months starting October from getting the CPAT notice that would leave some of you who have all your paperwork and everything needed ready for a March of 2026 Academy Which in reality is a very small select few. That academy if it does happen march of 2026 may be a majority 4528 due to 4044 not having enough time to be ready and cleared which would probably put them at an 80/20 (4528/4044) if not more Academy.  
Again realistically scheduling CPAT training, then CPAT, medical, psych, investigators etc it's a lot to do and probably wont get done in under 6 months not saying it can't but that's not the usual time process for most. I personally doubt most will have enough time to train process all the paperwork in a short amount of time for that first academy that's why so many people differ those first 1-2 classes typically then reinstate later.

Again these are my own Guestimates hopefully I'm wrong about everything & you guys get your scores by May 27th and into an Academy by October. Do you guys think your ready for October? Can you go in and not get injured? Are you physically fit enough to not injure someone else because you lost control of a tool? Are you currently running? Have you ever ran? Have you ever done anything physical? (serious questions to consider here)

Honestly everything has been so up in the air lately who knows if they release a new list around May 27th when 7001 is set to Expire and actually end 7001 In May? Nobody actually knows other than DCAS and C.I.D.

Only DCAS has an idea of when the list will be released, and even then it may get held up in limbo like 7001 did, regardless they will not give you a straight answer.

I was under the impression that the exam period for 4044 closed, However like I said I just saw the email one of you guys sent me about additional exam dates, so again... too many variables to give you guys an accurate answer. Regardless your not putting in your 2 week notice at your jobs when you get the notice, so don't rush it.

As far as posting questions that should be directed towards DCAS is concerned if we had someone on here trust me we would have added them to the mod team for r/FDNY & r/NYC_Candidate_Central.

You can reach out to DCAS directly but I'm sure they'll tell you something along the lines of:  
""Check your emails and spam mail"" I'm sure they'll also send out snail mail regarding it.

So I hate to say, You'll know when everybody else knows.

Question: **Why won't These questions be approved here**?

Well its simple... **None of you actually Read or Search for your answers before posting anything.**  
Many of these basic Questions have all been answered before, you guys choose not to search, but to ask someone else to answer it for you. Not O.K. you need to be able to help yourself with the basics before you can say you want to help others.

We have a very well thought out rules section which if you read it actually would help you guys with the basic answers to common questions like pay scale? or How do I join? The majority of which leads back to [joinfdny.com](http://joinfdny.com)

If you guys actually utilized the right resources. The experience will be way easier trust me on this.

This is not my first rodeo.

Everything you guys are about to go through I Just went through alongside 7001 from the very beginning till the very end and the previous list as well.

If I can make it easier for you guys I would trust me on that.

We have 2 dedicated places for you guys from 4044 to officially share information regarding everything around exam 4044. \*\*\* Until you guys have list numbers and can Join Candidate Central \*\*\*

The first resource is [Firehouse Forums Exam 4044 Page](https://forums.firehouse.com/forum/careers-training/hiring-employment-discussion/2135841-fdny-exam-4044)  
Which is probably your best source to share things on and best format for information sharing.  
They have a great mod team there and everything you post is instantly shared on the site.  
I am active on there however I am Not a moderator on there so policing people and making sure harassment isn't happening is not one of my duties there which frees me up to do what I'd like to do and that's just answer questions and be involved in the community. They handle approvals, filtering harassment, bans etc. It's great when given a chance and extremely well streamlined for information sharing. Especially for keeping things in order and never missing a single post that's just how forums work.  
Unfortunately on Reddit the majority of my duties on these subs are background work. Reading & Approving post, Filtering harassment complaints and false information & other complaints.  
Along with my time spent Approving members to our Verified Candidate / City workers page r/NYC_Candidate_Central which has been a success and massive resource to everyone that's come before you guys. The mod team there does a great job in helping and staying active there.  
Once you guys have list numbers you can send a DM or Modmail for approval after checking the [Verification Process Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYC_Candidate_Central/comments/12nbzga/verification_process/) and submitting the information as stated on there. Read the [Verification Process post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NYC_Candidate_Central/comments/12nbzga/verification_process/), respond to it as requested for faster approval.  
Lastly which takes up the majority of my time on here is actually reading and approving and responding to every single post on r/FDNY for the last 8+ years as a mod on here along with reading and answering every single DM, every modmail that you all have ever sent all in a timely fashion. I have yet to take 1 day fully off from this sub where I did 0 for this sub. This sub alone is a second unpaid full time job. It's a lot to be responsible for & Firehouse forums helps out a ton if its actually given a chance to be used by you guys, Their is an active FF team their to answer questions on there as well.

The second option is the [Exam 4044 Mega Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/FDNY/comments/1jhtti4/4044_exam_discussion_thread/) started by u/[thefridayking](https://www.reddit.com/user/thefridayking/); which was a great Idea but again only works if actually utilized.

Anything being posted regarding exam 4044 can be shared on either of those 2 links.

When a list goes public we'll make a post about it, if you guys don't beat me to it and share it on here as well.

However until then this is not the place to come and ask the same redundant question day in and day out. Many of you have sent me a DM around it and I already answered you directly and gave you my guestimate which I now posted above... Some of you then went and tried to submit the same exact post on here after you have received an answer directly. Seriously???  
I don't mind answering DM's. I think everyone on here who's ever reached out always gets a timely human, non A.I. response, but If your gonna do that don't waste my time with the DM, there's no point

Question:  ""**Why can't I Join Candidate Central now! It's not Fair! This is Reddit! I don't want to be verified**""

Answer:

1- Life is not fair.  
Ask everyone on 7001 that got 5 residency points while you guys are getting 10 now. That could have been a game changer for some that won't ever make it on and because of the extension have aged out, Point is Life's not fair.

2- The Entire point of Candidate Central is that... it's a community of City worker candidates. If you don't a city list number your not yet a ""Candidate"" as long as your on Any City List You Can Join just follow the outline in the verification post. Simple.

The point of Candidate Central is to also have people who have been where you are right now. Not so long ago they were where you are now, and are now a resource to help answer your questions.  
1500+ Verified members who know what your going through and get it. Probably faced some of the same challenges and can answer how to get through them. Now that the majority of them have made it on the Job Candidate Central is the only sub on reddit with over 1500 verified city workers on 1 sub and growing.  
In a sense It should feel like your first firehouse kitchen experience Verified people like you who went through what your going through and can help answer your questions.

The key word there is verified. Unless your on a city list we can't verify you. If you don't want to be verified nobody is forcing you. 1500+ have been verified... 0 have ever had any issues. Why would you be the first?

The point of verification is about keeping the general public / trolls / buffs / and retired guys out.  
You don't need someone saying ""you guys are lucky to car pool with a roof, a radio and AC... back in my day when I got on the job in 1982 we used a horse and carriage to get to The Rock the guy riding shot gun had to hold the umbrella"" or some dumb war story like that which is just nonsense. Trust me those people exist on here. They still post daily, if it's nonsense it's not approved.  
A candidate sub is not where any of these people should be.

However candidates should be on a sub with Verified members on the Job. And that my friends is the goal of r/NYC_Candidate_Central.

When you start the process we have what's called the ""mentorship program"" people on the job who are assigned to 5 candidates at a time and their job is to try to answer your questions for you and if they don't know they ask and find out the answers for you.

Guess what... If everyone on the sub is verified you that means you 1 mentor officially assigned to you by the job and you have 1500+ Mentors on here.

Trust the process it has been very well thought out for you.

Utilize the right resources for now that are above in this post.

Do not follow those fake FDNY subs & ""**hubs**"", there are many knockoffs.

There's only 1 r/FDNY & only 1 r/NYC_Candidate_Central

We know about all of the others.

If you took the exam I'd assume you're all adults It's not my job to tell you what to do but use your best judgement. If the mod isn't active on there it's probably because they realized how much of a full time job and how much work running a sub entails or they just gave up on the sub early on.

Also be careful with Discord, Telegram, and group chats where you have 10k people posting non stop information is posted so often you post a question right now and have to scroll up 5x just to find your own question and then scroll through praying someone answered you.

Using neither of those 2 scenarios really works or benefits You. Choose wisely.

Like I said trust the process and use what's reliable and what's been made for you guys. You may not understand the ""why's"" behind things but everything has been well thought out with all of your best interest in mind.

In either event lets hold tight for list numbers and wish each other the best of luck.

\- Best of luck to all that took 4044

1k7eonf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BMW/comments/1k7eonf/bmw_ireland/,BMW Ireland,"I always dreamed of owning a BMW. When I thought of BMW, the word premium came to mind. 
When I moved from Luxembourg to Ireland, I finally bought my first BMW in 2019. Here are a few thoughts from my so-called ‚Äúpremium‚Äù BMW experience:
1. First Purchase at main dealerDublin.After doing the paperwork and enjoying some good coffee, I got into the car they had started for me. Halfway down the motorway to Galway, I pulled over ‚Äî only to discover I hadn't been given a key. The car shut down. My phone died. I had to borrow a stranger‚Äôs phone to call the garage. Three hours later, a tow truck arrived. My 5 Series was taken away and I was given a 3 Series. A week later, I had to drive back to Dublin to swap it again. So much for a premium first experience.
2. Servicing LimerickFor a while, the service at main dealer Limerick was excellent. The car was cleaned inside and out, and there was always a card left on the dash rating the service. I was impressed.
3. Window Regulator FailureThen the window regulator failed. Window stuck open. Main couldn‚Äôt (or wouldn‚Äôt) do anything ‚Äî even though it was November and I had no garage to secure the car. I had to cover it myself while the car sat vulnerable. Eventually, they took the car but kept it for 3.5 weeks. Numerous complaints to BMW Ireland went nowhere. The service manager blatantly lied to me about vehicle tracking, and tried to put me off considering an electric BMW. It was a really poor experience. Service manager blamed recall issue for delay
4. Trying Again ‚Äî New Purchase in dealership GalwayDespite all this, I decided it must have just been one dealership ‚Äî surely BMW was still premium. I went to main dealer Galway and sat down with a salesperson to configure a new 5 Series. I left happy, waiting for a final price.Instead, two days later, a business manager called, offered ‚Ç¨5k less than market value for my car, and quoted me for a completely different 5 Series ‚Äî not the one I configured. I laughed and walked away.Word got back to a salesman Limerick who reached out, apologized, and promised no more service issues. Within an hour of meeting him, I bought a brand new 241 5 Series following and left happy.
5. I called main Dublin also but sales woman never returned by calls
6. Trying to Buy AgainFast forward to this year: My wife and I are expecting our first child. We decided to change her car, and possibly upgrade mime to X3. I contacted the same salesman in February. He said he would get back to me with a price.It‚Äôs now the end of April ‚Äî still nothing.Rather than chase, I visited another garage last Saturday. I bought a new car for wife within 12 minutes. No drama it‚Äôs a non BMW
7. Recent Service ExperienceToday I brought my car in for service. No courtesy car offered. No wash, no hoover, nothing left on the dash to rate the experience like before. No job card. Issue after recent software update I was told they would look at but said they found nothing and software good. I found issue within 5 mins of coming on Reddit.Just the basic service ‚Äî and a clear message that BMW is not what it once was. I have asked garage for job summary as maybe they didn‚Äôt even look at

BMW is not the premium car or brand it used to be. This will be my last BMW.

So, my question is, what has changed at BMW or was it always just imaginary that it was premium car service as my experience at three garages in Ireland in 7 odd years suggests otherwise.

Anyone else issues Ireland? Or globally? Find the whole thing shoddy and better off with another brand.",0,1745564402.0,BMW,0,0.33,False

There are quite a few little moments like that, and I love the window into a person's life that actually teaches me something I didn't know before.

1k7emyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1k7emyj/two_weeks_in/,Two Weeks in!,"My mom(58F) and I (27F) had started the diet after our boss raved about it (and we've seen visible results in him), honestly, we're both sceptics at the best of times when it comes to 'fad' diets after the Food Revolution Diet way back when made us all gain weight. We've started for a variety of reasons, Mom to try mitigate some effects from an autoimmune disease, and myself for a host of issues but most importantly mental health and clarity. 

  
After two weeks, there's been some good, some bad and some ugly. I personally have been dealing with Carnivore Sickness side-effects. But truthfully we're not following the diet super strictly. We do indulge in avocado occassionally, the idea of a fat-packed sirloin steak isn't exactly appetising to either of us, but for the sake of the diet we are trying our best. 

We've had carbs once in two weeks, when clearing out the last of our pre-prepped meals in the freezer and I'd be a massive liar if I didn't admit we've indulged in chocolate (it was Easter, marshmallow eggs exist, sue me) once in a while. In saying that though, I, who in recent years have been a sugar fiend, am finding it incredibly easy to say no to the cravings. And both of us, who could inhale a slab a day no questions asked, are finding it hard to take more than a block or two. I personally seem to get an upset stomach every time I eat something other than meat at this point in time, but my mom seems to take it in her stride (lucky).

  
Obviously these are the expected shortfalls of trying to cold-turkey from everything. We went in guns blazing, so I'd say all in all our shortfalls haven't been too bad. We're not planning on ever going strict strict - We'll have the little things once in a while, still have our morning coffee with full-fat milk and I occassionally will have sugar-free cooldrinks (I've always preferred sugar-free Sprite) if I'm out socially and feel for it.

  
I'm currently a bit sedentary I have a million excuses and none of them really are viable (It's been torrential and cold here, we're entering winter so the idea of going for a walk or run is simply just a drag). I do have a spreadsheet for an 8 week workout regime too that I've just been too lazy to start. I will motivate myself eventually. 

  
I've noticed a drop in bloating, slight weight loss (given that I'm not exercising like I should), I'm falling asleep easier and I finally finally have the energy and motivation to study! Staying asleep is an issue, but always has been, but I find now with the increased water intake I'm going to the loo more. I do try to cut my water intake at 7PM to mitigate this, but I am seriously thirsty all the time, is that a thing?

  
Anyway, any advice and motivation will always be appreciated, but wanted to pop a post here to introduce myself to the community, and also because I see it's a pretty male dominated subreddit (no hate) which I found a little intimidating at first considering most of you could probably inhale anything you want and not gain an ounce, but I see a gummy bear from 4 kms away and gain 2 kilos so of course your transformations look unbelievable.

It‚Äôs completely free, and you just need to create your own Claude API key to use it. They give you $5 of free credit the first time, which is enough for quite a bit of use.

The app is a digital handwriting journal: anything you write gets AI feedback that analyzes your thoughts, looks for patterns, and helps you gain personal insights. It stores all your context and history‚Äîup to 200,000 symbols (there‚Äôs a tracker in Settings). After that, it starts to forget earlier entries, but there‚Äôs still plenty of memory left.

I forgot to mention that it‚Äôs available only on iPad, and you need an Apple Pencil to use it. I also recommend a screen protector like PaperLike.

Here‚Äôs the link to the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/journely/id6744461713

By the way, I call it Journely. It‚Äôs like a journey but through the journal :) If you like it, please leave a review so more people can find it in the App Store search. And if you really love it, you‚Äôll find a ‚ÄúBuy me a coffee‚Äù link in Settings. :)

I‚Äôm currently working on the full version with an integrated backend and entry storage, but that‚Äôs a whole different story. This version stores all your entries on the device, uses the Claude API to process your inputs, and recognizes handwriting through AppleKit. In other words, it‚Äôs the safest option if you‚Äôre worried about your thoughts being sent to servers and seen by someone.

I dug deeper and found out the history ties back to European traders obsessing over Chinese porcelain, which led to years of experimentation before they landed on Bone China. It‚Äôs a cool blend of British innovation and Chinese influence.

From age 12-18 I lived in the hill country in South Texas, really isolated, no place to hang out after school, no mall to go to, no cafes or coffee shops, or whatever. Also, I enjoyed stuff like books and equality and not doing meth and getting drunk in the woods, so I didn't fit in with most of the kids who lived within driving distance. There was NOBODY within walking distance. Came home from school one day to find my dad had packed up the garage stuff, most of the furniture and bailed, left a note for my mom saying he wanted a divorce.

I got a job when I was 16 to help with money, and I was the only kid who had a job, so after school I couldn't hangout with anyone. Right as I got a little independence with a driver's license, I gave up nearly all my non-school time.

None of the girls I had a crush on ever liked me back. Never went on a single date. Never held hands. Didn't have my first kiss until I was 24 and it was just a random nothing of a kiss, not even romantic or sexual really, I just asked if I could kiss her and she said yes, never saw her again after that.

I've never had a girlfriend, never had a ""friend with benefit"", just two random one night stands. Every city I've lived in I've used tinder and other apps and I'm quickly met with the ""we've exhausted all potential matches for you in 50 miles of where you live.""

I've had what I thought were strong friendships (both male and female) over the years, but eventually those would all end when people would just kinda stop talking to me? Nothing epic happened to end a friendship, just a series of texts unanswered or plans that never came through.

Now in my mid 30s, the two people I would consider ""friends"" I basically never hang out with or talk to. We don't have much in common anymore either. And meeting new people essentially impossible at my age (and I've made the effort, even started a meet-up group in my city that went well for a few months before everyone got to busy or lazy or whatever and we stopped scheduling meetings after a couple months of only me and one other person showing up, which is just awkward).

At jobs, I was usually the only single person so no chance of meeting someone to maybe date from work. Plus, everybody had a bf/gf or a spouse or a kid, so no ""let's get drinks after work"" kinda friendships either. The pandemic really brought all of this into sharp focus for me. As people around the world were skyping each other or zooming or whatever, I literally had ZERO of those. My out of state friend was constantly on it for work and so he didn't want to do it in his personal life. I'd go crazy for weeks on end and eventually reach out to people in my city who were like, ""yeah, me and the girlfriend have taking up baking and gardening!"" No one was there for me. People sympathized, and I was open about how hard it was on me (again, the only single person in my friend group, the only person without a roommate) and nobody really seemed to care, at least no enough to change their behavior, not even enough to text a gif of a cute cat or a meme from some show we enjoyed...just radio silence unless I reached out.

And, I get it, my friends aren't my family, it's not their responsibility to take care of me. But it doesn't change the fact that I was in a really dark place and they knew it and these were people who had no qualms about saying ""I love you"" to me, we hugged goodbye, that kinda stuff. These weren't toxic ""no homo"" dude bros, they're really good guys who, I guess, just didn't have the bandwith for live-in girlfriends AND roommates AND jobs and also me.

I dunno. It's just been a really really lonely life and while I'll never act on it, I don't see much point in being alive other than to make OTHER people happy. Like I said, my friends and I are open about our feelings and stuff and when I've expressed how empty I feel my life is (no career, no family, no relationship) they say stuff like ""dude, you're wonderful. I don't know what I'd have done without you in my life. You've made my life SO much better"" and stuff like that, and yeah, great, I'm glad I was a good friend, but making other people happy can't be the only reason for me to live, right? Like, \*I\* want to be happy too! I want people to care about me as much as I care about them! 

Buh, Long post is long.

*   **Nylon:** Known for its ‚Å¢strength, durability,‚Å§ and resistance to‚Äç wear and tear. Nylon ‚Å£straps are frequently enough more‚Äã affordable but may not be as comfortable as cotton.
*   **Polyester:**‚Å£ Similar to ‚Å£nylon, polyester ‚Äåis durable and water-resistant.
*   **Leather:** Provides ‚Äåa‚Äå stylish and‚Äå durable option‚Å§ but ‚Äçcan be more‚Äå expensive.
*   **Recycled Materials:** Eco-conscious brands may ‚Äãuse‚Äå recycled materials like ‚Äãrecycled plastic ‚Å£bottles to create‚Äç their ‚Å§straps. Choosing an **eco friendly yoga mat ‚Å£strap** is a great ‚Å£way to support sustainability.

\----------------------------------------------  
  
When Jax kicks Willow out of the car, she's wearing nothing but a tantalizing piece of lingerie.  
  
The rain was relentless. She wrapped her arms around her nearly bare body, begging Jax not to leave her on the highway.  
  
His final act of mercy was tossing a thin coat out the window.  
  
""Elena just called to say she's back in the country. I'm going to pick her up now.""  
  
""You need to think about why you're so immature. She just got back‚Äîobviously she needs me more than you do.""  
  
Willow clutched her stomach in pain, sitting helplessly by the roadside, watching the car speed away.  
  
Cars whizzed past on both sides. She thought she saw people rolling down their windows, staring at her like she was a joke.  
  
""Hey, look at that slut‚Äîwhoring herself out on the freeway? How much for a night?""  
  
The cruel jeers echoed in her ears.  
  
If she could scream, she would've told them she was still a virgin. That she had worn the damn lingerie because Jax asked her to. That she thought‚Äîmaybe, just maybe‚Äîhe'd finally look at her.  
  
But all she could do was shake her head and shiver.  
  
She didn't realize danger was approaching.  
  
The last thing she remembered was a car skidding toward her.  
  
After the accident, Willow lost her memory.  
  
She still remembered her adoptive parents, her friends‚Äîeven the barista at the caf√© on the corner.  
  
But one person‚Äîshe couldn't remember at all.  
  
Jax.  
  
When Grace, her best friend, found out at the hospital, she was so shocked she dropped her iced coffee to the floor.  
  
""Willow‚Ä¶ You're not playing some twisted game of hard to get, are you? Faking amnesia just to get my brother's attention?""  
  
Willow blinked in confusion, her voice soft and genuinely puzzled.  
  
""Your brother? Who is he?""  
  
Grace froze. A few seconds later, her expression changed completely.  
  
""You're not acting? Then swear it!""  
  
""Alright,"" Willow said calmly. ""If I'm lying, may I never remember him again.""  
  
The vow hit Grace like a thunderbolt. She stood paralyzed for a moment before gripping Willow's shoulders.  
  
""You really‚Ä¶ really forgot my brother‚Äîno, forgot the name Jax?""  
  
""Is that bad?"" Willow asked, frowning. ""Was he important to me?""  
  
Grace's face twisted with complicated emotions.  
  
""Jax‚Ä¶ He's the guy you chased for seven whole years. The one you swore you'd marry, no matter what.""  
  
Willow's mind went blank.  
  
""So‚Ä¶ is he my boyfriend now?"" she asked tentatively.  
  
""No,"" Grace said awkwardly. ""He's always been distant. He only has one person in his heart‚Äîhis first love, Elena. Because of her, he rejected you‚Äîand everyone else.""  
  
""In fact‚Ä¶ the reason you got into the accident was because he went to the airport to pick up Elena, leaving you alone on the highway.""  
  
Willow was stunned.  
  
Grace handed her the phone. Willow tried unlocking it, but no code came to mind.  
  
""It's his birthday now‚Äî0122,"" Grace said.  
  
Willow entered it. The screen lit up.  
  
Thousands of photos of a man flooded the screen. His face‚Äîhandsome to the point of being unreal‚Äîstole her breath for a moment.  
  
""Well,"" she murmured, ""he's definitely my type.""  
  
But in all those photos, Jax's gaze toward her was ice-cold, void of warmth.  
  
She opened the notes app‚Äîthere were pages upon pages of detailed records:  
  
He likes black coffee, hates cilantro, is afraid of cats...  
  
And then, the diary entries‚Äîhundreds of them‚Äîeach one an attempt to get closer to him, to win his affection. All met with silence.  
  
""Seventh Valentine's Day. I rehearsed my confession a hundred times. Still rejected, just like every year. You say we'll never happen, Jax‚Ä¶ but why can't I let go?""  
  
""He got drunk again tonight. Mistook me for Elena. Held me and called her name over and over. That's when I realized‚Äîwe're both pathetic in love.""  
  
Willow couldn't remember any of it.  
  
But the tears still fell.  
  
Grace broke the silence.  
  
""So‚Ä¶ what now? Are you going to keep trying to recover your memory? My uncle's a top psychiatrist‚Äîhe can help you get treatment overseas.""  
  
""No need,"" Willow said quietly. ""If I loved him that much, and it hurt that badly, maybe forgetting is a second chance.""  
  
She deleted the photos one by one. Cleared the entire notes app.  
  
Grace was stunned and tried to stop her, but before she could say more, her phone rang.  
  
She glanced at the screen, her expression changing.  
  
""I have to head home‚Äîsomething urgent came up. Wait for me, I'll be back soon.""  
  
The room fell quiet again.  
  
A few minutes later, the landline rang.  
  
""Willow,"" the voice on the other end of the phone carried obvious anxiety, ""do you still remember that marriage contract that was set before? Their side has already urged several times ...... Our family really can't hold out now, if you don't marry, the family may go bankrupt.""  
  
She expected Willow to refuse. But after a moment's thought, Willow's voice came back soft but firm:  
  
""Alright. Once I'm discharged, I'll go through with the marriage.""  
  
Silence lingered on the line.  
  
""You‚Ä¶ you don't love Jax anymore?""  
  
Willow didn't know how to explain the amnesia, and she didn't want them to worry about the accident.  
  
So she gave a vague answer, choosing her words carefully.  
  
""I don't love him now. And I never will again.""  
  
Chapter 2 ‚Äî I Don't Love You Anymore  
  
After hanging up the phone, Willow glanced at the calendar, roughly estimating how long it would take to tie up loose ends.  
  
Without hesitation, she booked a one-way ticket to Santawill City for two weeks later.  
  
Just as she confirmed the flight, a nurse knocked on her door.  
  
""Miss Windsor, it's time for your follow-up appointment.""  
  
She nodded and eased herself into the wheelchair, following the nurse out of the room.  
  
What she didn't expect was that, the moment the elevator doors opened, she'd come face to face with the very man whose photos she had scrolled through countless times just days ago‚Äî  
  
Jax Monroe.  
  
The one person she had completely forgotten after her memory loss.  
  
And in that moment, when he saw her, his expression hardened into ice. His gaze was sharp and biting.  
  
""How did you know I was here? You followed me to the hospital too?""  
  
Willow froze.  
  
This was her first time seeing Jax in person since the accident.  
  
She had thought it might feel awkward, unfamiliar, maybe even bittersweet.  
  
What she hadn't expected‚Ä¶ was disgust.  
  
""You've misunderstood,"" she said quietly, barely audible. ""I was in a car accident. I've been recovering here. I didn't follow you.""  
  
Jax gave her a cold, scrutinizing look, as if assessing her every word. Just as he was about to speak, a nearby hospital room door opened.  
  
A woman stepped out.  
  
His entire demeanor shifted in an instant‚Äîhis sharpness softened, his features gentled‚Äîand he rushed over.  
  
""Elena, you're still running a fever. I told you to stay in bed. Why are you up?""  
  
At the sound of that name, Willow instinctively turned her head.  
  
The woman wore a flowing white dress, with chestnut hair cascading down her shoulders and porcelain skin that almost glowed under the hospital lights.  
  
She gave Willow a polite smile and asked gently, ""The room was stuffy. I just needed some fresh air. Jax, who's this?""  
  
""She's Willow Windsor,"" Jax replied calmly. ""A friend of my sister's. She works in our design department. We're not particularly close.""  
  
Willow listened as he introduced her. His tone was measured and distant‚Äîlike he was describing a stranger he had barely interacted with.  
  
Elena smiled warmly, her voice soft. ""Nice to meet you, Willow. Your head is bandaged‚Ä¶ were you in an accident?""  
  
""A car accident,"" Willow nodded. ""Mild concussion. Some memories are‚Ä¶ still a little unclear.""  
  
She hadn't even finished her sentence when a nurse called out from down the hall:  
  
""Willow Windsor, bed 1124‚Äîtime for your scans.""  
  
Willow gave a quick nod to both of them, murmured a goodbye, and turned away in her wheelchair, heading for the examination room.  
  
Behind her, Jax frowned slightly, his gaze lingering on her.  
  
Wasn't she the one who used to chase after him with a smile, refusing to give up, always trying to talk to him?  
  
Now‚Ä¶ she left without a second glance?  
  
‚Äî  
  
After her scans, Willow went to the pharmacy to collect her prescriptions.  
  
On the way back, the early spring sunshine filtering through the hospital courtyard tempted her. She rolled her wheelchair toward the fountain, basking in the warmth.  
  
Just as she reached the edge of the pool, a familiar figure approached.  
  
""Elena?"" she asked, slightly surprised.  
  
The woman smiled and nodded. ""What a coincidence. I came out for some air too.""  
  
Willow returned the smile politely, about to make small talk, when Elena walked over naturally and took over pushing her wheelchair, speaking breezily:  
  
""Jax had to take a call, left me on my own. I was getting bored out of my mind. Since I ran into you, mind if we chat for a bit?""  
  
She paused briefly, then added, her tone slightly probing,  
  
""I heard you and Jax have worked together for years. When I was overseas, someone mentioned there was a woman who chased him for seven years, relentlessly. Do you‚Ä¶ happen to know who that was?""  
  
Willow's fingers paused slightly on the armrest, but her heart didn't skip a beat.  
  
She looked up at the graceful woman beside her and smiled, her voice calm and composed.  
  
""I'm not sure who that was. But if someone pursued him for seven years, and he still only has eyes for you, then it's clear‚Äîyou're the one who truly matters to him. Everyone else‚Ä¶ doesn't.""  
  
She said it with a serene grace, without the slightest tremor.  
  
And as Elena listened, the smile at the corner of her mouth froze slightly for a moment.  
  
Chapter 3 ‚Äî Pushed Into the Water  
  
Elena blinked in surprise at Willow's calm and certain response, her expression suddenly softening with a hint of shyness.  
  
""You‚Ä¶ know about Jax and me? Has he‚Ä¶ mentioned me recently?""  
  
Willow remembered what Grace had told her‚Äîhow deeply Jax once loved Elena. She nodded.  
  
""He said he did.""  
  
A flush crept up Elena's cheeks, her eyes glowing with barely concealed joy.  
  
""He was a year ahead of me‚Äîback at Westbrook University. He was the kind of guy everyone looked up to, ridiculously outstanding. There was never a shortage of girls chasing him, but somehow, he chose me. Back then, I always felt he was way out of my league‚Ä¶ but he still insisted on pursuing me for months.""  
  
A nostalgic smile curved her lips, and her voice softened as she continued.  
  
""We were together for four years. He spoiled me in every way‚Äîstudying with me at the library, filling the campus square with roses on Valentine's Day. And anytime another guy tried talking to me, he'd get so jealous, it was almost funny.""  
  
Willow said nothing. She just listened, quietly.  
  
""Before graduation, he proposed,"" Elena went on, ""but I turned him down. I didn't want to become someone's future wife and get stuck in that role. I had my own dreams, my own path. So I left him and went to London to study.""  
  
""But I always knew he never really let me go. Even now, when I came back, he braved a thunderstorm just to pick me up at the airport. That moment‚Ä¶ I realized he was still waiting for me.""  
  
""I've been feeling unwell these past few days, and he's been taking care of me, day and night. I thought he was going to bring up getting back together‚Ä¶ but he never said anything. I started wondering if someone else had entered his world while I was gone.""  
  
Willow's expression didn't waver. She simply smiled, calm and composed.  
  
""If he still cares about you, maybe he's just planning something more special to restart things between you. Don't worry‚Äîhe could be preparing a surprise.""  
  
Elena visibly relaxed, the tension in her shoulders easing.  
  
She raised her hand to wave goodbye‚Äîbut her phone suddenly slipped from her fingers and dropped into the fountain with a splash.  
  
Startled, she instinctively bent down to retrieve it, but lost her balance and fell in.  
  
Willow froze for a second, then quickly turned her wheelchair around to go call for help.  
  
Just as she wheeled past the flowerbed, Jax appeared like a thunderbolt.  
  
Without hesitation, he dove into the water and pulled Elena out.  
  
She coughed violently, her face pale, and Jax held her tightly, whispering reassurances in a frantic voice, worry written all over his face.  
  
Willow watched the scene silently. Her heart sank a little, but she still turned to head for help.  
  
That's when Jax suddenly snapped his head up, his eyes burning with fury.  
  
""You did this, didn't you?!"" he roared. ""You pushed her in‚Äînow you're trying to play innocent and walk away?!""  
  
Willow's mind went blank.  
  
""No‚Ä¶ She dropped her phone and slipped. I didn't touch her‚Äî""  
  
""Liar!"" Jax's face twisted in rage. ""I stepped away for a few minutes and she ends up in the water‚Äîwith only you there? Who else could it be?""  
  
Before she could say another word, he stormed up to her, grabbed the handles of her wheelchair, and shoved it hard toward the fountain.  
  
The moment the chair hit the edge, Willow tumbled into the water.  
  
The cold hit her like a thousand needles.  
  
""I put up with your obsession before, but Elena is off-limits!"" he growled from the edge. ""If you don't know your place, don't blame me for being cruel.""  
  
He made a gesture. Two security guards appeared from nearby and blocked off the pathway.  
  
Willow thrashed in the water, coughing violently as icy liquid rushed into her lungs. Her injured leg split open again, blood blossoming in the water like ink.  
  
She was losing strength fast, her vision going dark.  
  
The last thing she saw‚Ä¶ was Jax walking away, carrying Elena in his arms.  
  
And then‚Äî  
  
Darkness.  
  
‚Äî  
  
She didn't know how long she was out.  
  
When Willow finally opened her eyes again, Grace's tear-streaked face was the first thing she saw‚Äîher expression caught somewhere between anguish and rage.  
  
""Are you insane?! The doctors said you would've suffocated if you were found just a minute later! I leave for a few hours and come back to find you nearly drowned?!""  
  
Willow blinked slowly, her mind hazy. She wanted to speak‚Ä¶ but the words caught in her throat.  
  
She wanted to tell Grace what her brother had done.  
  
But he was still her brother.  
  
Willow shook her head gently, her voice hoarse and thin.  
  
""I'm fine now‚Ä¶ don't worry about me.""  
  
She looked down, her eyes dull and lifeless.  
  
This time, she wasn't just disappointed‚Äî  
  
She was done.

1k7e69u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1k7e69u/girlfriend_wants_me_to_distance_myself_from/,Girlfriend wants me to distance myself from female coworker,"I‚Äôve been at my new workplace for almost a year. I had a pretty rough start since it seemed like most of my coworkers were standoffish and treated me coldly. That changed when I befriended an older coworker named Laurie.

We formed an instant connection because we had very similar backgrounds. For starters, we both went to school for computer science, and are now pursuing a Master‚Äôs. (I currently am, she‚Äôs applying) We also come from the same culture.

Laurie is in her mid 40‚Äôs, so I‚Äôve always seen her as a mother type figure. Or more accurately, like a ‚Äúcool aunt.‚Äù It‚Äôs purely platonic, and we‚Äôve never spent time outside of work. Laurie is also married.¬†

At first, my girlfriend was happy that I made a new friend at work. Then, over time, she became more uncomfortable with our friendship. Finally, it ended with her putting her foot down and telling me that I need to distance myself more from Laurie. These are all the things she found inappropriate about the friendship:

Laurie brings coffee, snacks, or even lunch for me almost every day at work. I never thought it was weird because I kind of felt like she was mothering me by making sure I had something to eat.

I make sure to walk her to her car after every shift. She‚Äôs barely 5 feet tall, and I just feel the need to make sure she‚Äôs safe. Our office building is in a pretty bad part of town. My girlfriend sees this as a romantic gesture. She also thinks it‚Äôs ‚ÄúBS‚Äù that I‚Äôm looking out for Laurie‚Äôs safety because, in her words, ‚Äúyou guys park in a private lot in front of the building. It‚Äôs not like you have to park on the street and walk a while to get to your cars.‚Äù

Laurie sometimes complains about her husband/marriage to me. I admit this was a little weird, especially at the beginning of¬†our friendship, but I honestly thought she was just venting. My girlfriend has asked me before if I ever felt like there was a deeper reason why she was venting to me, a coworker half her age, instead of her friends or women closer to her age. I really didn't think so. I even felt sad that maybe she has no one else to talk to about these issues. I thought that maybe my girlfriend was worried that I vented about us/her to Laurie as well, but I never have.

Her last straw was when¬†Laurie was planning to go to a networking event out of state, and asked me if I wanted to travel with her. The plan was to get an Airbnb with at least 2 bedrooms. My girlfriend became very distressed at the idea. No matter how much I told my girlfriend that we'd be in separate bedrooms, she would not let it go. 

She felt like the whole trip was inappropriate, and she was convinced that Laurie was going to ""make a move on me."" I lost my cool for a bit and called her paranoid. Laurie was married, so how low of a person does she think I am, if she's convinced that I have the hots for a married woman and want to cheat in my own relationship.

I was able to calm her down briefly, and she admitted that she blew up because we had never taken an out-of-state trip before, but I ""jumped at the first opportunity"" to go on a trip with another woman. We talked about it, and made a compromise that we'd plan a trip shortly after I returned from the networking event.

I thought that we were making progress, but recently, she's stated she still feels uncomfortable with my friendship with Laurie. She's accepted that I don't want to distance myself, so she's asked if I would be willing to just keep my interactions/conversations with Laurie to work-related topics.

I said no again because I really don't think that I'm doing anything wrong, and I don't think Laurie is crossing any lines.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started taking MITOLYN, I felt stuck. My energy was always drained, no matter how much I slept or what I ate. I‚Äôd wake up tired and spend the day fighting to stay awake. My brain felt foggy, and I was always reaching for snacks just to keep going. I tried drinking more water, exercising, and even bought a bunch of fancy vitamins, but nothing made a real difference.

Honestly, it was frustrating. I wanted to feel better, but I was starting to think maybe this was just normal for adults. Then one day, a friend mentioned MITOLYN. She swore it gave her a new kind of energy. I figured I had nothing to lose, so I gave it a shot.

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I noticed right away that it looked different from the other supplements I‚Äôd tried. The box was sturdy and sleek, and the bottles inside felt heavy and well-made. It didn‚Äôt look or feel cheap at all.

The instructions were clear and simple, which I appreciated because I hate complicated routines. I just had to take a couple of capsules with water each morning. That‚Äôs it. I started the very next day, feeling curious (and a little nervous).

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I expected to wait weeks for any changes, but I actually felt a difference within the first few days. The first thing I noticed was that I didn‚Äôt get that afternoon crash. I‚Äôd usually hit a wall at 2 pm and want to nap, but suddenly, I was powering through my work without yawning every five minutes.

By the end of the first week, my mind felt sharper. I could focus on tasks without getting distracted, and I finished things faster. My energy was more steady, and I didn‚Äôt feel the need to reach for coffee or energy drinks. Even my mood felt lighter‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt as grumpy or easily annoyed.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

There are so many supplements out there, but MITOLYN feels different for a few key reasons:

‚úÖ **Top-Notch Ingredients**
The label lists real, recognizable ingredients. No weird chemicals or fillers. It‚Äôs plant-based and science-backed, which made me feel safe taking it every day.

‚úÖ **Noticeable, Real Results**
I could actually feel a change. Not just in my energy but in my focus, my mood, and even my sleep. It didn‚Äôt just promise results‚Äîit delivered them.

‚úÖ **No Side Effects**
I‚Äôve tried other energy boosters that made me jittery or upset my stomach. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt do any of that. I felt good, plain and simple.

‚úÖ **Great Value**
At first, the price seemed a little high, but when I realized I was saving money by not buying other vitamins (and skipping that extra coffee), it felt totally worth it.

‚úÖ **Trusted by So Many**
There are thousands of reviews online, and I get why people love it. It really does what it says, and that‚Äôs rare.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the coolest things was how people started to notice changes in me before I did. My partner asked why I was so cheerful in the morning (I‚Äôm usually not a morning person!). My coworkers commented that I seemed more ‚Äúon the ball‚Äù during meetings. Even my best friend noticed that I wasn‚Äôt complaining about being tired all the time.

I told them about MITOLYN, and a couple of my friends even tried it themselves. They had the same reaction‚Äîthey loved it. It became a running joke: ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre not secretly a superhero now?‚Äù

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

I had a small issue with my second order‚Äîthe delivery was delayed. I emailed the MITOLYN customer support team, expecting the usual ‚Äúwe‚Äôll get back to you‚Äù runaround. But instead, I got a reply within an hour from a real person who apologized and fixed the issue right away. They even checked in later to make sure I got my package.

It was a simple thing, but it showed me that MITOLYN actually cares about its customers. That made me trust the brand even more.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Without a doubt, yes. I‚Äôve already recommended it to my family, friends, and even posted about it online. It‚Äôs not just another supplement. For me, MITOLYN has been a game-changer. I feel more alive, sharper, and happier than I have in years. If you‚Äôre struggling with low energy or just want to feel better every day, I think MITOLYN is worth trying.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Worth Every Penny

Looking back, I‚Äôm so glad I decided to give MITOLYN a chance. It‚Äôs made my days easier, my mind clearer, and my energy stronger. It‚Äôs rare to find something that actually lives up to the hype, but MITOLYN truly does. If you‚Äôre tired of being tired and want a real boost, give it a try.

# ‚úÖ What is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a special supplement made to help your cells make more energy. Think of it as fuel for the little power plants inside every cell in your body (these are called mitochondria). When your mitochondria are happy and healthy, you feel more energetic, you can think better, and your body can handle stress more easily.

What makes MITOLYN different is that it‚Äôs not just another multivitamin. It‚Äôs carefully crafted with a mix of ingredients that each help your body create energy in a natural way. The makers of MITOLYN say it can help you feel less tired, improve your memory and concentration, support your mood, and even keep you feeling younger for longer.

# üî• Key Benefits of MITOLYN

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt popular by accident. People love it because it helps in so many ways. Here‚Äôs what you can expect if you use MITOLYN every day:

# 1. Boosts Natural Energy (No Jitters, No Crash)

Most of us turn to coffee, energy drinks, or sugary snacks to get through the day, but those quick fixes can lead to crashes or make us feel jittery. MITOLYN works differently. It helps your body make ATP (that‚Äôs the main kind of energy your cells use), so you feel naturally awake and alert ‚Äî no shaky hands or sudden energy drops. You just feel steady, all-day energy.

# 2. Enhances Brain Function & Mental Clarity

Ever feel like your brain is in a fog? I know I have! MITOLYN can help clear up that fuzzy feeling by giving your brain cells the energy they need to work better. People who use MITOLYN say they can focus for longer, remember things more easily, and even solve problems faster. It‚Äôs like turning the lights on in your head!

# 3. Supports Mood & Reduces Fatigue

Feeling tired all the time can make anyone grumpy or sad. When your cells are running low on energy, your mood can take a hit, too. MITOLYN helps by giving your cells what they need to work at their best. This means you might notice you feel more positive and less worn out during the day, making it easier to handle whatever comes your way.

# 4. Anti-Aging & Longevity Support

Getting older is a part of life, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to feel old. MITOLYN helps your cells stay healthy and protects them from things that speed up aging, like stress and pollution. By supporting your mitochondria, MITOLYN can help you look and feel younger, so you can keep doing the things you love.

# 5. Cellular Repair & Detox

Every day, your cells face challenges from things like junk food, stress, and even the air we breathe. Over time, this can damage your cells. MITOLYN has ingredients that help your body fix this damage and get rid of toxins. It‚Äôs like giving your cells a clean-up crew so they can keep you healthy and strong.

# 6. Improved Physical Endurance

If you like to work out, play sports, or just want to be more active, MITOLYN can help here too. By improving how your muscles make and use energy, you might find you can exercise longer, recover faster, and feel less sore. It‚Äôs great for athletes, weekend warriors, or anyone who wants to stay moving as they get older.

# üß™ What's Inside MITOLYN? (Key Ingredients)

MITOLYN is made with a blend of ingredients that have been studied by scientists and shown to help your cells. Here are some of the main players:

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This hard-to-pronounce compound helps your body make new mitochondria, so you get even more energy factories in your cells.
- **CoQ10 (Coenzyme Q10):** This is a super antioxidant that keeps your heart and cells healthy while making energy.
- **L-Carnitine:** Think of this as a taxi for fat ‚Äî it helps move fat into your mitochondria, where it‚Äôs turned into energy instead of being stored.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** This protects your cells from damage and supports your brain and nerves.
- **B Vitamins:** These are like the spark plugs for your mitochondria, making sure energy production runs smoothly.

MITOLYN is made without any strange additives. It‚Äôs tested by third-party labs, is non-GMO, and doesn‚Äôt have any fake chemicals or fillers.

# üõ°Ô∏è Side Effects ‚Äì Is MITOLYN Safe?

Safety is always important. The good news is that MITOLYN is made from gentle, natural ingredients, and most people don‚Äôt have any problems when taking it. Some people say they feel a little more energetic or alert at first, but that‚Äôs usually a sign it‚Äôs working.

If you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medicine from your doctor, you should always ask them before trying something new, just to be sure it‚Äôs right for you.

# üë• Real People. Real Results.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a bunch of claims ‚Äî real people are seeing real changes! Many users say they wake up feeling ready for the day, their thinking is sharper, and they have more stamina for work, play, and exercise. Some even say they look and feel younger. Everyone‚Äôs experience is a little different, but the positive stories keep coming in.

# üõí Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôre tired of feeling tired, or you want your mind and body to be the best they can be, MITOLYN might be worth a try. It doesn‚Äôt just give you a quick boost and leave you crashing later ‚Äî it works on the root of the problem by helping your cells. While there are lots of supplements out there, few focus on mitochondria like MITOLYN does. It‚Äôs an investment in your energy and your future.

Before I ever heard of MITOLYN, my life was a series of tired mornings and sluggish afternoons. I‚Äôm in my early 40s, have two kids, and work at a desk all day. No matter how much I tried to ‚Äúfix‚Äù my fatigue‚Äîby drinking more coffee, trying new diets, or even buying expensive face creams‚ÄîI just couldn‚Äôt shake that constant feeling of being worn out. My mind felt foggy, I‚Äôd forget little things, and even after 8 hours of sleep, I still woke up groggy.

It wasn‚Äôt just my energy, though. I noticed I was gaining weight even when I ate healthy foods, and my motivation to exercise was at an all-time low. There were days I felt older than my parents! I was desperate for something to help me feel like myself again.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

MITOLYN is a supplement designed to support something called ‚Äúmitochondria‚Äù‚Äîtiny parts inside your cells that work like batteries, giving you energy. When your mitochondria aren‚Äôt working well, you can feel tired, lose focus, and even gain weight. MITOLYN promises to help recharge those batteries so you feel more alive, energetic, and clear-headed.

But MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just a random mix of vitamins. It‚Äôs carefully put together with ingredients that are known to help your cells make energy better. Some of the main things inside are CoQ10 (which helps your heart and muscles), PQQ (which helps make more mitochondria), and NAD+ boosters (which keep your cells young). There are also herbs like rhodiola and ginseng for focus and stress. It‚Äôs like giving your body a toolbox to fix the real problem, not just cover up the tiredness.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

Here‚Äôs how my experience played out‚Äîweek by week and month by month. I started slow, just to be sure my body was okay with it.

**Week 1:**  
I took one MITOLYN capsule every morning with breakfast. At first, I didn‚Äôt feel much. But after a few days, I noticed I didn‚Äôt need that second cup of coffee to wake up. I wasn‚Äôt bouncing off the walls, but I just felt‚Ä¶ more awake.

**Week 2:**  
Something amazing happened: my afternoon crashes disappeared! I didn‚Äôt have that desperate need to nap after lunch. My head felt clearer, and I started finishing my work faster.

**Week 4:**  
By the end of the first month, my sleep was deeper. I used to wake up at night, but now I was sleeping straight through. I even remembered my dreams! My mood was lighter, and I felt less stressed, even when things got busy.

**Month 2 - 3:**  
My energy stayed steady all day. I exercised more and noticed that I didn‚Äôt feel wiped out afterwards. Friends started to comment that I looked ‚Äúbrighter‚Äù and healthier. I lost a few pounds without changing much else.

**Month 4 - 6:**  
I kept taking MITOLYN every day. My brain felt sharp‚Äîno more forgetting why I walked into a room! I also noticed my skin looked better (bonus!). I felt like I had pressed a ‚Äúreset‚Äù button on my body.

**Month 7 - 12:**  
This is where MITOLYN really shined. I lost more stubborn weight, mostly around my belly. My doctor said my bloodwork looked better, and I had fewer aches and pains. I felt younger, happier, and more confident. For the first time in years, I actually looked forward to each day.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

MITOLYN works because it helps your cells produce energy the way they‚Äôre supposed to. Here‚Äôs how I understand it:

- **Mitochondria** are like tiny power plants in every cell. If they‚Äôre tired or broken, you feel tired and broken.
- **CoQ10** helps these power plants make energy. It‚Äôs like adding fuel to the fire.
- **PQQ** helps your body build more mitochondria, so you have even more energy factories.
- **NAD+ boosters** help your cells fix themselves and keep you feeling young.
- **Adaptogens** like rhodiola and ginseng help your body handle stress and stay sharp, without feeling jittery.

All these ingredients work together as a team. It‚Äôs not just about giving your body a ‚Äúquick fix‚Äù‚Äîit‚Äôs about supporting your energy at the source.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you wake up tired every day, struggle with focus, feel moody, or wonder why you‚Äôre gaining weight even when you try your best‚ÄîMITOLYN could help you. I think it‚Äôs for:

- Busy parents who need more energy
- People who sit at a desk and feel sluggish
- Anyone over 30 who wants to feel younger
- People who want a ‚Äúreal‚Äù solution, not just another cup of coffee

If you‚Äôre already super healthy and have loads of energy, you might not notice as big a change. But if you feel like your ‚Äúbattery‚Äù is running low, MITOLYN can help you recharge.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

**Pros:**
- I felt more energy, focus, and better mood within the first month
- Ingredients are natural and backed by science
- No side effects for me (and I‚Äôm usually sensitive)
- Helped with weight loss and better sleep
- Company is clear about what‚Äôs inside

**Cons:**
- It‚Äôs more expensive than many vitamins, but you get what you pay for
- You have to remember to take it every day‚Äîit‚Äôs not a magic pill
- Only sold online (can‚Äôt grab it at the store)

# MITOLYN Review: The Supplement That Gave Me My Life Back

I‚Äôve always been skeptical of supplements. There are so many out there, all making big claims, and honestly, most haven‚Äôt worked for me. But after trying MITOLYN, I knew I had to tell my story. I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say it gave me my life back. Energy, focus, motivation‚ÄîI got them all, and I want you to know there‚Äôs hope for you too.

# üß† The Life I Was Living Before MITOLYN

Imagine waking up every morning feeling like you barely slept. That was me. No matter how early I went to bed, I‚Äôd open my eyes tired, stiff, and groggy. I‚Äôd shuffle around the kitchen, desperate for coffee, but even that didn‚Äôt help much. My mind was cloudy, I‚Äôd forget why I walked into a room, and my patience was always thin.

Work was a struggle. I‚Äôd lose focus halfway through tasks. My body ached after sitting at my desk. I was only in my 40s, but sometimes I felt like I was much older. My family noticed, too‚ÄîI was cranky, low energy, and just not myself.

I tried the usual fixes‚Äîmore sleep, healthier eating, different vitamins. Nothing worked. Doctors said my tests were fine, but I knew something was wrong. That‚Äôs when I started reading about how our cell‚Äôs powerhouses, the mitochondria, affect everything from our energy to how quickly we age.

I realized my body wasn‚Äôt just tired‚Äîit was running on empty at a cellular level.

# ‚ö° What is MITOLYN and Why Is It So Powerful?

MITOLYN is a supplement that‚Äôs all about helping your cells make more energy, starting with your mitochondria. Instead of just covering up tiredness with caffeine, it helps your body fix the real problem‚Äîlow cellular energy.

MITOLYN is loaded with ingredients that science shows are great for your cells:

- **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol)**: This is like fuel for your cells‚Äô engines, helping them make more energy and keeping your heart healthy.
- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone)**: This special nutrient actually helps your body make new mitochondria‚Äîso you have more energy factories!
- **Acetyl L-Carnitine**: Helps your cells burn fat for energy, which means cleaner, better fuel.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid**: A strong antioxidant that protects your cells and even helps other antioxidants work better.
- **Resveratrol**: Famous for its anti-aging effects, it calms inflammation and keeps your cells healthy.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just about a quick burst of energy. It‚Äôs about helping your body rebuild its power from the inside out.

# üî• My First Month on MITOLYN: A Total Transformation

I started MITOLYN a little nervous but hopeful. I took two capsules each morning with water. For the first few days, not much changed. But by the end of the first week, I noticed I was waking up less tired. My brain felt clearer‚Äîlike someone had cleaned my glasses after years of smudges.

The real magic happened in week two. That afternoon slump where I usually needed a nap? Gone. My workdays got easier, and I stopped reaching for coffee every few hours. My workouts felt less like a chore and more like fun again. I even noticed I was less grumpy with my family.

By the end of the month, I felt younger. My skin looked brighter, I was laughing more, and my motivation was back. I could keep up with my kids, handle my job, and still have energy for myself at the end of the day.

# üí™ Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

Here‚Äôs why MITOLYN stands out from everything else I‚Äôve tried:

**It fixes the real problem.**  
Most supplements just give you a quick pick-me-up with sugar or caffeine, but MITOLYN helps your body make more real energy by fixing your mitochondria. You feel better for longer, not just for an hour or two.

**It helps you make new mitochondria.**  
PQQ is a superstar ingredient that tells your body to grow new energy-making cells. That means more power, not just a temporary boost.

**It fights cell damage.**  
A lot of aging and tiredness comes from little bits of damage building up in your cells. MITOLYN has antioxidants that protect your cells and help you age better from the inside.

**It‚Äôs based on real science.**  
Every ingredient in MITOLYN is backed up by research. The makers didn‚Äôt just throw random things together‚Äîthey picked what actually works.

# üß¨ Who Needs MITOLYN? (Spoiler: Probably You)

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt just for people who are sick or elderly. If you:

- Wake up tired, even after a full night‚Äôs sleep
- Can‚Äôt get through the day without coffee or naps
- Find yourself forgetting things more often
- Get less out of your workouts than you used to
- Feel older or more stressed than you should

Then MITOLYN could help you, too.

Honestly, even if you‚Äôre healthy, MITOLYN can help you feel your very best, stay sharp, and slow down aging. It‚Äôs like giving your body an upgrade.

# The Struggle Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, life felt like walking through quicksand. It didn't matter how much I slept, I was always tired. School, work, spending time with friends‚Äîeverything took extra effort. Sometimes, I‚Äôd even forget simple things because my brain felt foggy, like I was trying to think through a thick cloud.

I also noticed I got sick a lot. The tiniest cold would knock me down for days. I tried exercising more, eating salads, and drinking a ton of water, but nothing seemed to change. Every new supplement promised miracles, but after a week or two, I‚Äôd feel exactly the same‚Äîtired, distracted, and frustrated.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a supplement that‚Äôs made to help the tiny ‚Äúbatteries‚Äù inside your cells, called mitochondria. These mitochondria are super important because they help make the energy that your body and brain need to work. When your mitochondria are healthy, you feel more awake, stronger, and even happier.

MITOLYN has a blend of special ingredients like vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. It‚Äôs designed to help your mitochondria make more energy and protect your body from things that make you feel tired or sick. It‚Äôs like giving your body a boost from the inside out, instead of just covering up your tiredness.

# The Life-Changing Impact of MITOLYN

The first day I took MITOLYN, I didn‚Äôt expect much. I‚Äôd tried so many things before, after all. But by lunchtime, I felt a gentle lift in my energy. It wasn‚Äôt like drinking a sugary soda or a cup of coffee that makes you jittery. Instead, I felt steady and awake, like I could actually finish my day without dragging myself through it.

After a few days, I started looking forward to mornings again. I didn‚Äôt need to snooze my alarm three times. I noticed I was smiling more and even had the motivation to take my dog for an extra walk in the afternoon.

# Week 1: A Noticeable Shift

By the end of my first week with MITOLYN, I was honestly surprised. Usually, I‚Äôd crash by the afternoon, but now I could focus on my homework or projects without needing a nap. I even started finishing my chores earlier so I could hang out with my family before bed.

My mind felt clearer, too. The ‚Äúfog‚Äù I was so used to started to fade. I stopped losing my keys so often, and it was easier to remember what I needed at the store. I even noticed I was less grumpy with my friends and family.

# Week 3: Immune Support & Enhanced Recovery

After three weeks, something else amazing happened: I realized I hadn‚Äôt gotten sick. Normally, I‚Äôd catch at least one cold by now, but I felt strong. Even after running around outside or working late, I bounced back way quicker than before.

My muscles weren‚Äôt as sore after exercise, and I didn‚Äôt need as much time to recover. I even started trying new activities, like biking and swimming, because I knew my body could handle it. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just help me feel better day-to-day‚Äîit made me feel more resilient, like my body was finally keeping up with my life.

# The Science Behind MITOLYN

Let me break down why MITOLYN works, even if you‚Äôre not a scientist. Our bodies get energy from tiny parts inside our cells called mitochondria. When these mitochondria are healthy, we feel energetic. When they‚Äôre not, we feel tired and slow.

MITOLYN uses key ingredients like CoQ10, a special helper that keeps mitochondria running well, and alpha-lipoic acid, which helps your body use energy better and fights off the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù that make you age faster. There are also B vitamins, which are like fuel for your body, and magnesium, which helps everything run smoothly.

All these ingredients work together to make sure your body can make energy, protect itself, and recover faster. That‚Äôs why MITOLYN doesn‚Äôt just wake you up for a few hours‚Äîit helps your whole body work better.

# Why MITOLYN Is Different From Other Supplements

I‚Äôve tried more supplements than I can count, but none of them helped like MITOLYN. Most other supplements just pump you full of caffeine or sugar for a quick high. You end up crashing later and feeling even worse.

MITOLYN is different because it works with your body, not against it. It doesn‚Äôt just cover up problems with fake energy. It helps your body fix what‚Äôs actually wrong‚Äîunhealthy mitochondria, missing nutrients, and not enough protection from stress. That‚Äôs why the results last, even after the excitement of trying something new wears off.

Plus, MITOLYN is made from high-quality, researched ingredients. I never felt jittery or had a stomachache like I did with other pills or powders. It‚Äôs gentle, but powerful.

# The Results Speak for Themselves

After a full year with MITOLYN, I feel like a new person. I have the energy to do what I love without worrying about running out of steam. I‚Äôm more focused in school, better at my job, and actually enjoy hanging out with my friends and family.

Even better, I get sick way less. When I do catch something, I bounce back faster. My body just feels stronger and more capable.

My mood is brighter, my mind is clearer, and I finally feel like I‚Äôm living life at 100%, not just getting by day after day. MITOLYN didn‚Äôt just change my energy‚Äîit changed my confidence in what my body can do.

# Final Thoughts: Should You Buy MITOLYN?

If you‚Äôre sick of being tired, getting sick all the time, or just not feeling like yourself, I really think MITOLYN is worth trying. It worked for me when nothing else did. I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner instead of wasting time on things that only helped a little or not at all.

MITOLYN isn‚Äôt magic‚Äîit‚Äôs science that actually works. Give it time, and you‚Äôll feel the difference. For me, it meant happier days, better health, and a whole new outlook on life.

# My Problem Before MITOLYN

Before I started using MITOLYN, I was really struggling every day. My energy was always low, and I felt tired even after a good night‚Äôs sleep. It was hard to focus on my schoolwork or even enjoy time with my friends and family. Sometimes my muscles would ache for no reason, and I just felt like I was running on empty. I tried lots of things‚Äîdrinking more coffee, eating healthier, and even taking other vitamins. But nothing seemed to make a real difference.

I started to get frustrated because I wanted to feel better and do more, but my body just wouldn‚Äôt keep up. I worried that maybe this was just how things would be for me. That‚Äôs when I came across MITOLYN, and after seeing so many people have good results, I thought, ‚ÄúWhy not give it a try?‚Äù

# First Impressions Matter ‚Äì And MITOLYN Nails It

When my MITOLYN package arrived, I could tell right away that this was a quality product. The box was sturdy and looked really nice‚Äîalmost like a gift! Everything inside was packed neatly, and the instructions were super clear and easy to follow. I didn‚Äôt have to guess about how much to take or when. That made me feel confident about getting started.

Even opening the bottle, it smelled fresh, not weird or chemical-y like some other supplements I‚Äôve tried. I liked that the capsules weren‚Äôt too big, so they were easy to swallow. Right from the start, I felt like MITOLYN was a step above the rest.

# The Results Were Almost Instant

I was honestly surprised by how quickly I noticed a change. Within the first few days, I started to feel more awake in the mornings. Instead of dragging myself out of bed, I actually looked forward to starting the day. My mind felt clearer, and it was easier to pay attention in class and remember things.

By the end of the first week, I wasn‚Äôt yawning all afternoon, and I didn‚Äôt need extra snacks or coffee to keep going. My body just felt lighter and stronger. Even my mood was better‚ÄîI laughed more and got less grumpy. It was like MITOLYN had flipped a switch inside me.

# Why MITOLYN Stands Out

So, what‚Äôs so special about MITOLYN compared to everything else I tried?

- **Top-Notch Ingredients:** MITOLYN is made with only the best stuff‚Äîno weird chemicals, no junk, just pure nutrients that my body needs.
- **Real Changes You Can Feel:** A lot of supplements make big promises, but MITOLYN actually delivers. I really felt the difference, and it wasn‚Äôt just in my head.
- **Safe and Gentle:** I didn‚Äôt have any stomach aches, jitters, or side effects. I could use MITOLYN every day without worrying.
- **Worth the Money:** Even though it wasn‚Äôt the cheapest option, I ended up saving money because I stopped buying other things that didn‚Äôt work.
- **So Many Happy Users:** With thousands of great reviews, MITOLYN clearly helps lots of people, not just me.

For me, MITOLYN wasn‚Äôt just another pill‚Äî it became something I looked forward to taking every morning.

# People Around Me Noticed

One of the best parts was that people around me started to notice the change, too. My family said I seemed happier and more energetic. My friends asked how I was able to keep up with everything. Even my teachers noticed I was more focused and doing better in class.

I told them all about MITOLYN, and some of them tried it as well. They were amazed at how quickly it worked for them, too! It felt good to help others feel better, just like I had.

# Customer Support That Actually Cares

At one point, I had a question about my subscription, so I reached out to MITOLYN‚Äôs customer support. I was worried I‚Äôd have to wait forever for a reply, but they got back to me the same day! They were super friendly and helpful, and they made sure I had everything I needed.

It‚Äôs rare to find a company that treats you like a real person and not just a number. MITOLYN‚Äôs team really cares and wants you to have the best experience.

# Would I Recommend MITOLYN?

Yes, absolutely! I already tell my family and friends about MITOLYN all the time. If you‚Äôre feeling tired, unfocused, or just not your best, I honestly think MITOLYN is worth a try. It worked for me and for so many others, and I wish I‚Äôd found it sooner.

- whenever the guy he just hired we will call him steve closes he is so lazy like he will leave the compost completely overfilled overnight because he simply just thinks he‚Äôs too good to do it and i know closing at our shop is easy because i have been opener and closer also the closer only has to take out compost at the eod because opener or mid shift with do the trash recycling restocking etc . 
- they make up rules on the spot that only apply to them simply because they are buddy buddy and too lazy to do anything and simply want everyone else to pick up after them‚Ä¶ for example gaslighting me by saying mid shift has always done compost not closing which is such a lie because closer has always done it until he started ‚Äúclosing‚Äù like 2 months ago
- refuse to do trash or restock if it‚Äôs just them together on the schedule that day‚Ä¶ why am i coming in the next morning having to change all the trash bags (5 of them) plus restocking in the morning on top of opening the cafe???? psa ik opening is easy but at our shop we have more to do than others it takes over 30 minutes 
- the manager has been clocking steve in for a 8 hour shift when he comes in HOURS late everyday and the tips are pooled every pay period so he‚Äôs literally stealing money from everyone else while doing the least amount of work!!!!!
- also refuses to clean the most simple things like the espresso machine he will literally leave espresso grinds in over night
