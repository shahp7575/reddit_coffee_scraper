Advice needed really worried.
My boyfriends dog started acting weird the past few hours. 

Her medical history, to my knowledge, is:
•fixed

•up to date shots

•normal weight 

She also had a seizure when she was one(got into some trash coffee) and hasn't happened since. 

Other than that, she has been in good health. But tonight, she was like a fully body twitch almost. It looks like she has the hiccups, but we quickly realized it wasn't. She's been a little lethargic. After taking her out, she started what looked like gagging, or maybe she had something stuck in her throat ?? 

I know it's vague, but we are really worried about her. Should we take her to a vet or try? Is there a way we could examine her ourselves ?

Any advice and help needed, please (edit:spelling)",1,1737785360.0,DogAdvice,0,1.0,False

I have a decent job working a tech role at a coffee company. I’m 5’11 and in decent but not exceptional shape. I workout and stay active. I have varied interests and make a point to go out when i can. I’ve had some dates from my dogged persistence. i’ve been assured by others including women that are not family members that I’m decently attractive for a man, maybe in the 6-7 range.

I’m on a couple dating apps and they’ve actually destroyed my self image. I have minimal success on them and am lucky to get maybe 1 date a year on them. I’ve tried doing some revamps based off of advice but nothing sticks. I’ve learned to hate my face. I hate the way it looks. I hate the puffiness of my cheeks and feel like I should even get buccal fat removal if it would help in some way with how women view me. I entered the dating world right about the time that apps became prominent and i’m filled with resentment toward the people that created them. I hear about my parents experience dating in the late 80s and early 90s and I envy them. I look at my best friend who is still with his girlfriend he met at a party in college and I envy him. I’ve seen the ease and complete lack of effort that certain men have in being with women. Women absolutely enamored with them as soon as they walk through the door of the bar, barely a word out of their mouths. The holidays were the worst. All my male cousins showed up with SOs. I have no intention of living into old age alone whatever happens. 

It’s not all doom and gloom with me. i’m funnier in person. I can make women laugh. I love talking about shared interests in art and music with women. I can put on a mask and a show for people when I lock in. But every day is barrage of blackpill rhetoric and demoralization. The 80/20 rule yada yada. You’ve likely heard this same story a million times before but it’s better to word dump on reddit than jump off a bridge.

I was a college athlete and still run/lift multiple times a week. I’m in pretty good shape. I track my calories, and have been training for a hyrox (CrossFit type race) this year. I’d drink a coldbrew and then have a few diet cokes at night. Bloodwork 2-4 times a year. No health problems.

Two weeks ago on a normal Sunday night, I had a panic or anxiety attack. I had never experienced that before and it was scary. I reduced thc and caffeine usage and was feeling a little better everyday. A week after the first one, I had ANOTHER attack. Not as bad since I’d already been through the first one, but now I was worried. Got checked out by my doctor and my heart was great on the EKG resting hr of 46-48 bpm. 

I tried a coffee and it made my day horrible of anxiety. Same with thc immediate regretted it. So now today is day 4 of no caffeine, thc, or Diet Coke. Life is teetering on pointless lol. But seriously my anxiety has been something now I have to manage through deep breathing and praying like I feel terrible. I’m just hoping all this goes away after a few more days.

As I understand it, the reasons to not drink coffee with your aligners in is a) to not trap sugar on your teeth and get cavities, b) to not warp them from heat and c) to avoid staining.

I don’t take sugar in my coffee (I do realise milk has some sugar in it - I’ve worked out my cup would have about 3g of sugar in it from the milk, not sure if that’s enough to be concerned about). I drink a warm coffee, not a scalding hot black one, so warping shouldn’t be an issue.

I work from home and change weekly on Thursday nights. If I don’t care about the possibility of staining them a bit, am I right in saying there’s nothing else stopping me from drinking coffee with my aligners in from, say, Monday on? I’m just going to be hermiting at home until I put my new set in for the weekend, so why would I care if they’re slightly discoloured?

I know some people have said you might have to go back to last weeks aligners but why would that happen? My dentist doesn’t do remote monitoring, I have 9 weeks worth of aligners with me right now and he said if I ever lose a set just move straight on to the next week’s.

I’ve worked out it takes me 30 mins to sip my morning coffee. I’m highly motivated to get my Invisalign off ASAP, so I’m inclined to drink coffee with them on to be able to reduce the time they’re off.

Is there something I’m missing or is my thinking here rational?

And I'm not sure it was a scam, so posting it here instead of on the r/scams.

I was leaving the gym in Florida I went to back then (circa 2015) when a woman around my age (thirties) approached me and struck up a conversation. She was dressed for the gym and entering it as I was leaving it seemed and I forget what she said but just basically started talking. She was above-average attractive but not like model beautiful. Her approach though seemed off: kind of the way a realtor or someone paid to sell you something would talk, but she didn't seem to be pushing anything, either—not a pyramid scheme or anything. I was cordial but at the time in a hurry so kind of just wanted to get away from her. 

Walking to my car I did notice that she was still outside and had not entered the gym, which seemed odd since she seemed on her way to work out. That was however the last I saw of her: never before nor after saw her at the gym, in the gym, or elsewhere. 

About a week later I was leaving a sporting goods store (I am seriously into soccer and running) and an athletic college-aged guy comes up and asks me about local running clubs. I explain I don't exactly know much about this because I run mostly sprints so I'm not doing the type of distance running as most runners in town would; I mean, I have heard of some, I belong to a track club, but really not up on who is doing what for marathon training or such. He continued small talk, said he just got out of the Navy and moved here, asked if he could get my number and we could get coffee sometime. He was attractive but I noticed his hair was a bit long for just out of the service. Now, he didn't say when he left the Navy, but still. Something just didn't say ""Navy vet"" about this dude: had he said he was a new college kid, sure, I'd have believed it. But I know a lot of military guys and didn't read as military. Most recently separated young enlisted *really* read as military, though. 

So I told him thanks but I was in the process of moving to Omaha (not true). He looked absolutely gobsmacked. I kind of wanted to talk with him more but was also a bit creeped out so I said I had to leave and did. A few days later I saw him at my gym in the parking lot and pretty sure he saw me so I decided to walk back into to the gym like I left something there (I'd just come outside) and see if he followed but he didn't: if not a member he'd have been stopped in the lobby after all. When I came back out he was gone.

- I’ve been very reliant on the auto steam function the bambino plus which IMO is great. Will I be able to make half decent micro foam after a few goes and then perfect over time?

Gender: Male

 
Age: 24


Height & Build: 5'5"", relatively fit


Relationship Status: Single


Education & Profession:
I have a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering and currently work as a software engineer in Sydney, Australia.


A Little About Me:
I was born and raised in the UAE and I have spent much time in Pakistan tbh, originally from Punjab. These days, I’m living the Sydney life, balancing my tech career with my love for the outdoors(I know it's quite cliche 🤣). I’m a practicing Muslim who doesn’t smoke, drink, or do drugs. I’d call myself a coffee addict and an adventurous soul who enjoys camping, hiking, fishing, and long walks. I also love gaming when I’m not exploring the great outdoors. Romantic at heart, I value honesty, love, and strong family connections.


Family:
I come from a Punjabi family with two older brothers, one younger brother, and my amazing mom and dad. We’re big on supporting each other and value good vibes all around.


Where I Live:
I currently reside in Sydney and family in Pakistan lives in Punjab.


Religion:
I am a practicing Muslim as I pray all the prayers and have done umrah multiple times in my life. I keep all my fasting in order aswell and hopefully you are aligned on the same level as me.


What I’m Looking For:
I’m looking for someone who is kind, beautiful in her own way, and amazing to be around. A partner who values family, has a positive outlook on life, and enjoys the little adventures. Bonus points if you love coffee and are up for camping or fishing trips!


Deal Breakers:
I don’t get along with overly emotional or cold personalities, and I’d prefer someone with no major family issues. Excessive male friendships or negativity in relationships are also not my vibe. I don't mind if you had past relationships as long as you have overcome it.


My Timeline:
I’m hoping to take the plunge in about 1-2 years. In the meantime, I’d love to get to know the right person and grow together. The reason for this is that I wish to build my financial situation a bit more and then get married.


Why You Should Say Yes:
If you’re someone who wants a romantic, caring, and supportive partner who can cook almost everything, I’m your guy. I’ll always prioritize our happiness, keep the spark alive, and make sure life feels like an adventure we’re on together.

Context:


My husband (30 M) and I (30 F)have been married for 2 years. Nakikitira ako ngayon sa house ng parents niya ever since nabuntis ako since gusto nila Meron ako kasama at malapit na ako manganak. Kasama na din dun yung mga kapatid niya (28 M, 33 M). 

Parehas kami ni hubby nasa medyo busy na work/school. First generation doctor siya at nag ttraining pa din (3rd year surgeon) at nasa law school ako na working student. We’ve been together since college. 

Sobrang supportive sila na in-laws. Lahat ng kaya I-support I-tutulong sa akin at sa mga anak nila. Pero Ang masama dito sobrang na baby silang magkakapatid. Gusto din ng in-laws ko na madami kasama yung future apo nila kaya until maka graduate kami, dun muna for now. 

Yung asawa ko na yung pinaka “independent” at “adult”. Yung tipong naasahan sa mga Gawain sa bahay or tumulong sa parents niya. Yung dalawa niyang kapatid parang nasa high school or college pa din kumilos.

Kami ng asawa ko nagbibigay ng share/parang rent namin monthly kasi siyempre matatanda na at working. Pero yung dalawa niyang kapatid wala binibigay. Di din sila timutulong sa bahay. As in naka asa sa yaya/parents lahat. Kailangan silang paglutuan. Yung pinag kainan, iiwanan lang. Pag mag order ng food, Kailangan Sobrang mag adjust kasi picky eater yung Kuya. Need pag isipan/i-pack baon nila para sa work. 

Pati pag lumalabas kami yung husband ko yung parang naging “panganay”. Nun nag out of town kami, sinabihan ako ng MIL ko na bantayan si Kuya ng asawa ko kasi baka mawala sila. Tapos yung kotse nila na 2 years na Kanila di niya alam paano buksan yung trunk. Coffee maker need siya turuan na parang grade school paano paganahin. Pati blender need I-spoon feed paano gamitin.  Meron 2 year old labrador yung Kuya pero di siya yung nagaalaga. Kaming lahat ang nagpapakain, ligo, etc. Siya yung type na pagka uwi ng bahay, mag kukulong na sa kwarto tapos baba lang kung kakain. As in walang ambag. Pati kwarto niya araw araw need linisan ng yaya. 

Yung pinaka nainis ako ay birthday ng MIL ko nun isang araw. Siyempre need mag handa. Nag aayos ako nun mga ibang handa at si husband tumutulong din sa ibang handa. Humingi ko ng help kay kuya BIL kasi need mag slice ng cheese para sa charcuterie board. Ang sagot niya sa akin ay “hindi ako marunong mag bukas ng cheese at mag slice eh.” 

Hindi ko na napigilan dahil di ko alam kung bobo ba siya pero sinagot ko “huy 30+ ka na, dapat marunong ka na niyan.”  Pati sa pag drive at park ng mga sasakyan kami ni hubby ang gumagawa kasi yung mas batang kapatid di marunong tapos si kuya hindi pa Sobrang galing mag drive. 

Tapos todo hanap pa ng GF pero madami daw nakiki pag chat pero parang walang interested/second date. 

Nag ask siya sa akin if meron ako friends na single/looking for a relationship pero di ko masabi diretso na ayaw ko siya I-reto kasi medyo bobo siya. Walang common sense. 

Hindi siya jowa vibes pero para siyang anak. Need alagaan at pag silbihan. Yung mga iba akong pinsan na college mas tao/adult pa kyesa sa ka ya. Kung galit ako sa friend ko I-rereto ko talaga siya pero Hindi eh. Love ko mga friendship ko. Gusto ko sabihin talaga na may itsura ka lang pero wala ka ambag sa buhay. At least ang aso Meron kwenta at maasahan na emotional support at pakikisama. Ikaw wala. Grow up. 

Also Gusto ko lang I-clear na walang disability/learning delay/kahit anong sakit si Kuya. 

Additional note: gusto ko din kasi maging aware siya dito. Baka kasi di niya alam na di niya pa nagagawa yung adulting na dapat niyang nagagawa. Concerned ako kasi in the long run pag wala na in si MIL and FIL, feeling ko kami ni hubby ang mag tataguyod sa mga kapatid niya kung di sila mag aayos. ",0,1737782918.0,adviceph,2,0.5,False

Reika strode down the dimly lit corridor, her strawberry-red hair cascading over the shoulders of her black leather jacket. Her piercing ocean-blue eyes glimmered with determination as she bit her tongue in mild irritation. She hated being summoned unexpectedly.

Pushing the door open, she stepped into the office. The faint scent of coffee and polished wood greeted her. The room was modestly lit by a single desk lamp, casting shadows across the walls. Behind the large mahogany desk sat Vrus, the head of the government agency that handled the most dangerous and complex cases.

“Yes? You called me?” Reika’s voice was steady as she crossed her arms, studying Vrus.

Vrus swiveled his chair around to face her. His brown mid-length hair was slightly disheveled, and a bandage wrapped around his hand hinted at a recent injury. He leaned back in his chair, his sharp brown eyes scanning her.

“We’ve got a new case,” he said simply.

Reika raised an eyebrow. “And that is?”

Vrus pulled out a file and slid it across the desk toward her. “Several people have gone missing recently. We sent one of our agents, Yason, to investigate, but he’s gone dark. The last thing we received from him was a set of screenshots—images of what looked like a game-like arena. After that, all contact was lost.”

Reika picked up the file, flipping through its sparse contents. “And you’re sending me to investigate?”

“Yes, but not alone,” Vrus replied, his tone firm. “We can’t risk losing another agent. You’ll have backup.”

Reika frowned. “I don’t need backup. I work better alone.”

“I’m aware of that,” Vrus said, leaning forward. “But this time, it’s non-negotiable. You’ll be going with three of my best agents.”

She sighed, reluctantly closing the file. “Fine. At least tell me who they are.”

Vrus pressed a button on his desk, and the door behind her opened. Three agents entered, their footsteps echoing in the quiet room.

The first was Wasmit, a lean man with long black hair and piercing black eyes. He wore a tailored coat and carried himself with quiet confidence. At 23 years old, he’d been in the agency since he was 16, known for his sharp observational skills.

The second was Farzat, whose friendly smile immediately softened the room’s tension. His mid-length black hair framed his face neatly, and his approachable demeanor belied his sharp intellect. At 22, he had earned a reputation for his resourcefulness in the field.

The third was Yokouta, towering over the others at six feet tall. His well-built frame and serious expression hinted at a no-nonsense personality, though those who knew him well would say he was surprisingly easygoing. At 21, Yokouta was one of the agency’s most reliable operatives.

Farzat stepped forward first, extending his hand to Reika. “Greetings, Miss Reika. It’s a pleasure to work with you.”

Reika eyed his outstretched hand for a moment before shaking it curtly. “Greetings, I guess.”

Farzat chuckled softly, unfazed. “Well then, shall we get going? The sooner we start, the sooner we solve this case.”

Reika glanced back at Vrus, who nodded. “Take care, and keep me updated. This mission is critical.”

Farzat gave him a confident wave. “Don’t worry, boss. We’ve got this.”

Reika turned on her heel, her boots clicking against the floor as she led the way out. The four agents stepped into the crisp evening air, the city lights glinting in the distance.

As they walked toward their vehicle, Reika’s mind was already racing. What had happened to Yason? What was this “game arena” he’d discovered? And why did she have a sinking feeling that this mission was far more dangerous than anyone realized?

Unbeknownst to them, they were already being watched. The shadows seemed to shift as they disappeared into the night, and the game, whatever it was, had already begun.

Background: I have had a sweet tooth all my life, and gone through periods of extreme sugar cravings. I even had some periods when I chose to eat sweets instead of proper food and became slightly malnourished (in university, when I found out nobody stops you from having ice cream for breakfast).

For the past year I have managed to cut down my desserts from 3-4 times a week to occasional, but I did still indulge in chocolate after a meal, and sugary fizzy drinks.

I have now replaced the sugary fizzy drinks with a can of kombucha per day, (and tea/coffee/decaf/sparkling water), and after a few days I notice I just do not fancy anything sweet!

The chocolate bars and bonbons look as appealing to me as pieces of cardboard. Last time I tried to quit cold-turkey, I had such cravings that I was seeing dancing donuts when closing my eyes and literally drooling... it was tough.

3. Main Street Bakery (definitely lotion, maybe as a BW and HS)

5. Marshmallow Fireside (as a lotion)
6. Acai Berry Spritz (BW)
7. Chai Sugar Cookie
8. Vanilla Eggnog (lotion. I know vanilla can be a very tiring scent, and gross, if they get the making of it wrong—heard several times that VBN smelled like soured milk)
9. Peach Bellini (BW)
10. Pumpkin Spiced Latte (hard to say, because coffee can be very strong)
11. Toasted Cinnamon Sugar (I didn’t get to smell this one, so I wonder what it would be good as. I feel like it’d be safe as a lotion, and if it’s not too heavy handed on the cinnamon, it might be really nice as a BW)

Everyone is worthy of a beautiful and loving relationship. To all readers, I would appreciate your complete honesty about whether I'm experiencing the awakening of an abusive relationship or I'm just being a little sensitive bitch. 

My bf and I have lived together for about 3 years, within those three years I was pregnant and now have a toddler with us. I've noticed that he's getting more and more *comfortable* (aggressive) to put it lightly. He does show me love such as saying I love you, asking me what I want to eat, brings me flowers, buys me stuff, taking me on dates, pays for my car and insurance.

However, there are things that he told me to do such as remove all social media, lose contact with my long-term male friends. Due to not wanting our son to get sick I cannot be around extended family and only go to my mother's house when there's certain people there. He's gotten upset bc I attended last year's Christmas with my family last year and our son got sick afterwards. He added that I cannot take my son to my mom's house when my older brother is there bc he's a drug addict. I can't be assuming if he's mad/bothered/angry. I can't give out son medicine by my own judgement, I have it ask him. I can't take my son to target bc it's ""liberal"". 

Let me make it clear that he's never hit me, never threatened me with anything, none of that.
But he does tend to throw, hit and slam things in my presence while mad which is why I'm here. He has thrown out food I made that same day for my son saying he doesn't want out son to eat that, he's thrown coffee mugs saying that it spilled on the chair and that's why he threw it. Slamming doors after a discussion, slamming the chair in bc ""it's heavy"". I recently heard 3 loud bangs coming from the bathroom, he claimed that our sons shampoo and my dove shower gel fell but it was so loud that our downstairs neighbor called to make sure everything was okay, and mind you he wasn't taking a shower. Again that was after a bit of a rub up with him. He once told me to get out of the house bc I wa midway in the house with the door open and he started questioning my ""attitude"", in response I said nothing what's wrong with your fucking attitude? That's when he told me to get out, not once but twice. All bc ""the neighbors could hear"" so he kicked me out. That's what's happened in the past 4 or 5 months. 

To be honest, he does scare me, I do flinch at times. I don't understand why tho bc I've never been in an abusive relationship before nor has he ever hit me. 

Please reddit family, tell me the truth. I'm just being sensitive to all of this? This is normal male behavior? Right? 😕 ",3,1737781591.0,abusiverelationships,5,1.0,False

I'm really struggling with this whole adulting thing and could use some tips, as I am slowly going into credit card debt.

* Rent:   4500   $ for a studio in Soho. I wanted something similar to my apartment dorm in Kansas for 800$. Some   of my friends only pay 3000$  to live in these old apartments in east village, but they don't have basic amenities like central AC and laundry. Doesn't seem worth it.
* 400$ Utilities + Cellphone.     300   $ Gym Membership
* 100  $   Month Health insurance
* 300$  Daily Latte at Coffee shop (I know, I know, but I need my coffee)
* 700$  Weekday Meal Delivery Service (Factory 75, but might switch to cook unity. I can't cook but wanted to have something like my college meal plan)
* 67 $ Cat food
* 750 $  Garage Parking for my toyota prius
* 250 $ Car Insurance
* 133 $  Commuter Plan for subway
* 500$ restaurants with friends on the weekends.
* 500$ For Alcohol at bars/clubs or shows
* 500$ for incidental expenses (clothes, household expenses, doctors visits, crunchyroll and other subscriptions)
* 300 $ a month for edm shows, comedy clubs, various covers
* 500 $ student loan payment.

total is  like 9500$. Some times it goes into 10,000$ , because of random expenses.  I don't think my spending on anything in specific is really is too crazy and am at a loss for what I could be doing different.

I'm supposed to spend two weeks in Japan at the end of the year and was supposed to go EDC in Vegas, but I am not sure where I am going to actually get money for those things, as I don't usually have anything left over at the end of the month.

One of these stores is conveniently located right next to a Home Depot. The morning rush is typically fueled by migrant workers who gather in the parking lot for jobs, grabbing sandwiches and coffee to start their day.

Lately, though, sales have dropped significantly. The owner of the Subway—a vocal Trump supporter—got frustrated and asked my friend's mom why business was slowing down. She explained that most of their morning customers are those migrant workers. But with Trump-era immigration policies, deportation threats, and rumors of checkpoints, many of these workers are staying home to avoid risking their safety.

And you know what the owner said? ""That’s Biden’s fault.""

The kicker? My friend’s mom is undocumented, and so are most of the employees at the Subway—hired by her. The owner, blissfully unaware, relies on her to run the place and keep the staff in line. But if the fear of raids grows and my friend’s mom or the employees stop feeling safe enough to work, who’s the owner going to hire then?

3. Similar amount don’t know any deals, or will just say the name of the deal and not be able to answer any follow on questions.

You have privilege, you have pretty much everything you can ask for. I used to have that. Until my father, the head warrior, died protecting the Alpha and then all of a sudden we were nothing to the top pack leaders.

My mother had never really had a job before. She met her mate when she was 18 and had me, which meant she stayed home with me and dad was the worker.

That was 5 years ago now. I still wonder how my mother managed to live through the death of her mate.

She’s the strongest woman I know. Especially after having our house taken off of us, our car, our entire life taken away.
We are now ranked lower than omega’s. My mother works endless dead end jobs just to pay the overpriced bills that the Alpha has given us and to put food on the table.

But I’ve noticed the decline in my mother since my father died. She doesn’t eat as much, she works too much, she doesn’t take care of herself, and the Alpha has since passed the reins on to his son who is just as ruthless and arrogant as he was as an Alpha.

My mother just wants me to get the hell out of this pack and find my own way in life. So I don’t have to suffer the same fate.

I woke up one morning and I looked out the window from the couch that I was sleeping on and it was pouring down rain. It was going to be a really crappy day.

I rolled off the couch and stumbled to the kitchen to get a coffee when I saw some hand picked flowers sitting in a vase and a note was sitting in front of them.

Happy Birthday Morgan,

I’m sorry I can’t be there to celebrate with you. But you have a good day. You’re finally 18. I can’t believe it. You’ve grown up so quick. I love you.

Love Mom.

“Wow. Mom really loves us.” My wolf Bella said in my head.

“We already knew that.” I said.

“I know. Are you going to have anything more than just coffee?” She asked.

“Yes, actually.” I said, opening a drawer and grabbing a packet of cigarettes. And I stood next to the kitchen window of our trailer as I lit it up.

“I still can’t believe you stole those. If you get caught then you are screwed. The Alpha will throw you in the dungeon.” Bella said.
“Would you relax? No one saw me.” I said.
“Yeah. You were lucky.” She said.

I went to the bedroom where the only closet was and I started going through my half of it and I grabbed a pair of frayed jeans, a black t-shirt and black boots.

I grabbed my bag and put a raincoat on and I left the trailer that my mother and I shared.
It took us half an hour to walk to school because everyone wanted us as far out of the way as they could. So we were in the middle of nowhere, just inside the tree line with no neighbors and in an area that doesn’t get patrolled much.

When I finally got to school I felt like a drowned rat.

I took my raincoat off and put it in my locker and I started getting my books for my first class.

There were only a couple of minutes to go before I had to be there.

I heard a group of people walking down the hall towards me.

I turned to look at them and I knew all of them. Some of them were old friends of mine and some I had never wanted to be friends with at all.

Now, they all hated me since we were looked down on by omega’s. Which is a rare thing.

As the group walked past me, I was still going through my locker when the guy at the front threw his shoulder into me and I hit the side of the locker with my face.

Him and his friends started laughing as they all kept walking, but I pulled my head back and felt a little bit of blood next to my eye.
“Asshole.” I said. And the group stopped and turned back to look at me.

“What did you just call me?” Ryan asked me.
“You heard me.” I said. And he gave his bag to his friend and walked over to me. He wanted to look down on me, but since I was unusually tall at 6 foot 1, no one could really look down on me.

“You really should be careful who you talk to like that. Or maybe we could go behind the gym and see what all the fuss is about. I heard that you’d give it up to anyone just for something to eat.” He said, moving a piece of hair out of my face.

I slap his hand away and he grabs me by the arms and he slams me back into the lockers.
That’s when I noticed a crowd starting to gather around us.

“Don’t ever lay a finger on me tramp, I outrank you.” He said.

“Go to hell.” I growled in his face.
He then slapped me across the face and when I pulled my face back, I wiped my hand across my mouth and saw a little bit of blood on it.
“You little slut.” He said.

“You know your problem right now?” I asked.
“And what’s that?” He asked.

“You’re standing too close.” I said. And I headbutted him in the face and he stumbled back a few steps, letting go of my arms as he did it.

I was able to move away from the lockers and Ryan lifted his head up with blood pouring out of his nose.

“You’re in for it now.” He said, rushing me.
But I quickly stepped off to the side and grabbed him by his hair and slammed his head into the locker and then I kneed him in the stomach. As he was crouched over, I kneed him in the face and he was flat on his back after that.

His friends looked like they were going to start advancing on me, and I was ready for that. Afterall, they are wolves. And wolves hunt in packs.

“What the hell is going on down here?” A booming voice came from the other end of the hall.

Suddenly all of the onlookers scattered and it was just me and Ryan left there with a couple of Ryan’s friends.
I looked up to see Principal Grayson storming towards us.

“Shit.” I muttered to myself.
“I asked a question. What the hell is going on here?” Grayson asked again.

“Isn’t it obvious? That piece of trash attacked Ryan.” Quinn said. Ryan’s girlfriend and my ex best friend.

“Would you please get him up and take him to the nurse? He’s bleeding all over the floor?” Grayson asked his friends. So they helped him up and they got him out of there and then Grayson walked over to me and tried to stand over me as well. Trying to intimidate me.
“What do you have to say for yourself?” He asked.

“Are you going to believe anything I say?” I asked.

“Get to my office.” He demanded. So I closed my locker and I went to Grayson’s office.
I was surprised when I opened the door and Beta Levi was standing there in his three-piece suit.

Grayson walked in behind me and he bared his neck to Beta Levi out of respect. Something that I never did because I don’t respect anyone in this pack anymore. I had no reason to.

“What’s going on?” I asked.
“You’re coming with me.” Beta Levi said.
“I have class.” I said.

“Are you disobeying a direct order?” He asked.
I followed Beta Levi out of the office and we got in his car that was waiting at the front door for us.

We drove through town until we got to the packhouse and when I got out of the car I was suddenly very nervous.

I was shown inside and the packhouse looked pretty much the same as it did five years ago. The living room was off to the right, but Beta Levi took me through a couple of rooms to the left and down a hallway until we came to a large mahogany door.

He knocked on it and I heard a deep voice sing out for him to open it.

So he opened the door and I walked inside the office first, but Beta Levi shut the door behind me.

It was a pretty large office with a massive desk and Alpha Logan was sitting behind it in his finely pressed three-piece suit.

As soon as he looked up at me and I saw the firm sculpture of his face and his slicked back brown hair and green eyes staring at me, I started to feel dizzy.

Crunching as I press myself forward against the stale, windy air. Frost creeps along the borders of the big glass windows. Framing sleep deprived college students and depressed professionals while they peer over their work. Looking toward the street as if it will provide them with a stronger thesis statement or the inspiration they once felt. A feeling that brought them to where they sit now.

The door handle would have been cold if not for my leather mittens creating a barrier between my dry, cracking skin and industrial black steel. A woman in a white winter hat with a pompom walks toward the exit. I hold it open for her.

 “Thanks,” she says. She smiles at me while passing. 

“You’re welcome,” I respond and smile back. Something about this gesture reminds me of church and my childhood. Peace which was once so easy to obtain. Finally, I can bare my red scaly hands. I make a beeline for a glass case of crappy day-old pastries next to the register. 

I have plenty of time. So I watch the underpaid, overworked employees. All in their late twenties, scurrying about and making the same coffee that I could have made at home for one-third the price. Black aprons with blue accented logos cover what I can only imagine are flowery tattoos. One of them sits at the espresso machine watching steam fill their glasses while another person waits for their macchiato. 

A couple customers wait before me, their impatience surrounded by the strong smell of roasted beans. I wonder if everyone here understands how terribly destructive those little plants are. Do they all know what it took to get them to us? I try not to think about it. I pick out what seems to be the freshest of the day-old blueberry muffins. The man in front of me has on a Yankees cap. “Tough loss for your team,” I say. He smiles and nods. The most socially acceptable way of saying, “I do not want to talk to you.”

The line inches forward as the next addict arrives to replace the last. The cashier punches in his order and he slaps his plastic card against the machine. He takes a step to the side. Joining the other queue of patrons who wait for their pick-me-up. Placing myself in front of the counter with an order I’d been rehearsing since before I opened the front door. The muffin goes on the counter too. “That’s everything, thank you,” ends the conversation. They finally call some variant of my name. One which I wasn’t aware existed until now. Different enough from my own that I feel weird about going up to take it. Maybe someone else ordered this exact drink and carries this, until now, fictional name. 

“Thank you,” I say as I take the cup off the counter and wrap it within a cardboard mitten. I walk toward the door, but stop at an empty table a few feet from the exit. Place my coffee down so that I can cover my hands like I did for my drink. Truly ready to brave the outside elements again, I pick up my cup and push my body against the metal handle. Cement and salt under my winter boots, just where I had left them.

She suggested my birthday when I asked if she had openings this week and if she cared if I booked. Long story short, I’m trying to date her again, she’s everything I’ve ever wanted as cliche as that is. So I bring her coffee and some food before the massage and we chat a bit, talk through the massage and before I go she brings up hanging after she’s done for the day. Of course I’m all for it so I go snowboarding for a bit, meet up with her and we head out the casino. We both end up down but oh well, I’m enjoying my birthday with a girl I’m interested in and that’s been in my life on and off for 14 years so it’s just laughs and good vibes. I’m enjoying myself. The casino was just under an hour drive from her place so knowing my intentions I ask her about dating again and we talk about the issues we’ve faced before on the drive and yada yada. She’s not saying no to entertaining it like I asked but agree that we need boundaries so we’re not doing this dance again. I tell her it’s all or nothing, I want her as a partner and the reasons why and what’s different and why I think it would work. She listens but doesn’t have much input as I’m sure I’ve put more thought into these things than she has which is fine. I didn’t expect a reply to my perspective/statements immediately, it was more just think about what I’m saying and lmk. I leave her place after a little chat there and call her with a couple after thoughts I wanted to add. Whole ride home I couldn’t shake the feeling that she had other plans tonight rather than going to bed, and sure as shit im pretty sure a guy she’s seeing came over. I creeped on her socials a bit and found she is seeing someone after telling me this morning she’s not dating currently and just healing after what she’d been through, which was understandable. So now it’s my birthday, I essentially broke my own heart over her again and what started as an awesome birthday ended with saying goodbye to someone that I find it depressing to live without. She’s not the only option I have, she’s just the one I’d choose over everyone every time. Now I’m in bed alone with 10 minutes left of my birthday just contemplating what’s next in life and hopefully it’s happiness but the coming days/weeks seem very bleak. Just can’t believe it. Happy birthday to me.

My husband (30 M) and I (30 F)have been married for 2 years and I’m currently expecting. Nakikitira ako ngayon sa house ng parents niya ever since nabuntis ako since gusto nila Meron ako kasama at malapit na ako manganak. Kasama na din dun yung mga kapatid niya (28 M, 33 M). 

Parehas kami ni hubby nasa medyo busy na work/school. First generation doctor siya at nag ttraining pa din (3rd year surgeon) at nasa law school ako na working student. We’ve been together since college. 

Sobrang supportive sila na in-laws. Lahat ng kaya I-support I-tutulong sa akin at sa mga anak nila. Pero Ang masama dito sobrang na baby silang magkakapatid. Gusto din ng in-laws ko na madami kasama yung future apo nila kaya until maka graduate kami, dun muna for now. 

Yung asawa ko na yung pinaka “independent” at “adult”. Yung tipong naasahan sa mga Gawain sa bahay or tumulong sa parents niya. Yung dalawa niyang kapatid parang nasa high school or college pa din kumilos.

Kami ng asawa ko nagbibigay ng share/parang rent namin monthly kasi siyempre matatanda na at working. Pero yung dalawa niyang kapatid wala binibigay. Di din sila timutulong sa bahay. As in naka asa sa yaya/parents lahat. Kailangan silang paglutuan. Yung pinag kainan, iiwanan lang. Pag mag order ng food, Kailangan Sobrang mag adjust kasi picky eater yung Kuya. Need pag isipan/i-pack baon nila para sa work. 

Pati pag lumalabas kami yung husband ko yung parang naging “panganay”. Nun nag out of town kami, sinabihan ako ng MIL ko na bantayan si Kuya ng asawa ko kasi baka mawala sila. Tapos yung kotse nila na 2 years na Kanila di niya alam paano buksan yung trunk. Coffee maker need siya turuan na parang grade school paano paganahin. Pati blender need I-spoon feed paano gamitin.  Meron 2 year old labrador yung Kuya pero di siya yung nagaalaga. Kaming lahat ang nagpapakain, ligo, etc. Siya yung type na pagka uwi ng bahay, mag kukulong na sa kwarto tapos baba lang kung kakain. As in walang ambag. Pati kwarto niya araw araw need linisan ng yaya. 

Yung pinaka nainis ako ay birthday ng MIL ko nun isang araw. Siyempre need mag handa. Nag aayos ako nun mga ibang handa at si husband tumutulong din sa ibang handa. Humingi ko ng help kay kuya BIL kasi need mag slice ng cheese para sa charcuterie board. Ang sagot niya sa akin ay “hindi ako marunong mag bukas ng cheese at mag slice eh.” 

Hindi ko na napigilan dahil di ko alam kung bobo ba siya pero sinagot ko “huy 30+ ka na, dapat marunong ka na niyan.”  Pati sa pag drive at park ng mga sasakyan kami ni hubby ang gumagawa kasi yung mas batang kapatid di marunong tapos si kuya hindi pa Sobrang galing mag drive. 

Tapos todo hanap pa ng GF pero madami daw nakiki pag chat pero parang walang interested/second date. 

Nag ask siya sa akin if meron ako friends na single/looking for a relationship pero di ko masabi diretso na ayaw ko siya I-reto kasi medyo bobo siya. Walang common sense. 

Hindi siya jowa vibes pero para siyang anak. Need alagaan at pag silbihan. Yung mga iba akong pinsan na college mas tao/adult pa kyesa sa ka ya. Kung galit ako sa friend ko I-rereto ko talaga siya pero Hindi eh. Love ko mga friendship ko. 

Gusto ko lang I-clear na walang disability/learning delay/kahit anong sakit si Kuya. 

ABYG kung sabihan ko siya na di ko siya kayang I-reto kasi wala siyang common sense? 


Additional note: gusto ko din kasi maging aware siya dito kasi in the long run pag wala na in si MIL and FIL, feeling ko kami ni asawa ang mag tataguyod sa mga kapatid niya kung di sila mag aayos. ",15,1737780372.0,AkoBaYungGago,14,1.0,False

Honestly, it was one of those nights where campus felt kind of nice—quiet, a little chilly, but peaceful. I was just thinking about how much I regret leaving my readings until the last minute again, and how I really need to stop spending so much money at the Tim Hortons in the UC because the coffee isn’t even that good. Anyway, I was cutting across Johnston Green when I heard these faint noises, like someone moaning or… yeah, *those kinds of noises*. At first, I figured, okay, maybe it’s just a couple hooking up somewhere nearby (because, let’s be real, it happens), but as I kept walking, the noises didn’t fade—they got louder. And weirdly enough, it started to feel like they were following me.

It wasn’t just random noises either—it was rhythmic, like way too deliberate to just be someone messing around. I tried to laugh it off, but there was this weird tension in the air, and I started to get that heavy feeling, like I wasn’t alone. When I passed Lennox/Addington, the noises suddenly stopped. Completely. Like someone had flipped a switch, and all I could hear was my own breathing. For a second, I actually felt relieved.

But as I passed the courtyard, it started again, and this time, it was louder and felt way too close, like it was coming from right behind me. I turned around, but there was no one there. Just the empty walkway and shadows that looked… wrong, like they weren’t cast by the lights in the right way. By then, I was properly freaked out and power-walked the rest of the way to my building, slammed my door shut, and locked it.

This morning, I tried to convince myself I was just tired and imagining things, but on my way to class, as I passed the Arboretum parking lot, a raccoon bolted out of the bushes and lunged at me. Like, it wasn’t after food or anything—it just hissed and tried to scratch me before darting back into the trees. Between that and the weird noises, I think I’m done with late-night walks on campus for a while.

**TL;DR:** Heard weird, um, *intimate* noises late at night on campus, felt like they were following me, and then a raccoon attacked me near the Arb the next day. I’ve had enough of this place.",7,1737780025.0,uoguelph,4,0.9,False

I've asked chatgpt but it can't find it for me either. The book was from the 1980s or 1990s,

 I read it in early 00s. Tween book.

It was about a girl around the age 10-13 She has a boy best friend and they used to hang out in an alley or a fenced in area something like that. She had a penpal she wrote to, and lied to the penpal saying her best friend died. 

Her penpals mom sent the best friends mom flowers and the main character was embarrassed.

 I think she was running for class president or something of the sort. 

She had a hard time being friends with other girls There was a scene in the book where she was at a birthday party of a classmate she wasn't good friends with I think. I remember her being at the girls house and reached for a handful of nuts from the bowl in the coffee table.

 There was another part of the book where she borrowed her sister's nail polish, I think it was blue. 

 It's not a book by Johanna Hurwitz, definitely not a babysitters club book and it's not by Paula danzinger or jean van leeuwen.

The cover had a group of students standing in a classroom talking/laughing together. The girls were dressed in skirts/ tights or a dress with ballet flats, they were all clean cut. Clearly a dated cover. This is a very clear memory of the cover so anything that does not show this isn't going to be it.

The rich tapestry of cuisine is shared[,](https://imgur.com/a/VfprZ8S) borrowed, and re-invented, and today we will share a story about a tasty Ukrainian dish that is a representation of how cultures from across the world influence one another.

In this case, the story starts with the establishment of a trade route with the Americas and bringing new foods that are now feeding most of the world - corn. With great respect we must recognize the sheer scale of the tragedy this trade route brought to people in the Americas. For the oppressed and always starving people in the Carpathians (anyone who has tried to grow crops in the mountains without modern technology knows what I am talking about) corn was a divine gift from faraway nations. Folk in the Carpathian mountains started to cultivate corn with great reverence and soon it became a staple food. And this is how **Banosh** was created - one of the first fusion dishes of traditional Ukrainian and world cuisines.

So what is banosh? It is a thick cornmeal porridge cooked on sour cream (sometimes fresh cream or milk) and served with bryndza (Ukrainian sheep cheese) and shkvarky (bacon cracklings). Sometimes it is served with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Banosh is a part of a large continuum of ground corn-oriented foods - in the same big family as polenta in Italy, Mămăligă in Romania, grits in the USA, hasty pudding in the UK, and pastel de choclo in Latin America.

Banosh - or *banush*, as the Hutsuls say - should be mixed only with a wooden spoon and it needs to be mixed only in one direction, preferably clockwise so all ingredients are evenly distributed in the porridge creating a golden goodness of flavors. The most aromatic and enigmatic banosh is created in a cauldron on an open fire outdoors, but as most of us do not really cook like that anymore (I will leave unanswered whether it is a bad or good thing), we will provide you with a different recipe as well. Also, what is super interesting is that, traditionally, banosh was cooked by men. I like this concept :)

# Traditional Banosh

[This is a fantastic example of the consistency of a traditional banosh. If you zoom in, you can see that butter has started to separate from the porridge. Grandma would approve.](https://preview.redd.it/7idvl555i2fe1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a1c1d8865f45ffd8e9ed01278f401138c132516)

Ingredients:

* 500 ml of cream (or sour cream - although in this case, porridge will be a bit sour which we like :) )
* 200g of cornmeal
* Pinch of salt
* Cheese (preferably sheep, something like fresh feta or farmer's cheese)
* Bacon (preferably something very fatty and thick-cut, like pancetta or pork belly)

**Recipe:**

1. Pour the cream into a cauldron (or a pan with thick walls), put on moderate heat, and bring to a boil.
2. Little by little, add cornmeal, constantly stirring with a wooden spoon
3. Reduce the heat to a low, add a pinch of salt, and cook, stirring, until the porridge is almost soft. You may need a little more cream at this stage, as the porridge should have the consistency of thick sour cream, without turning into a homogeneous ""cake"".
4. At the same time fry the bacon cut into cubes to create cracklings.
5. Back to the porridge - while the cauldron stays over heat, beat the porridge with a spoon so intensely that buttery oil appears on its surface (remember we did not add butter, so it is kind of cool!). When you see the melted butter - transfer it to a shallow plate.
6. Spread the cracklings on the banosh, and also spread the crumbed cheese on the plate as well - this needs to be done while the porridge is very hot so the cheese will melt!
7. *Optional:* Add fresh parsley and/or a fried egg.

# Vegetarian Recipe

And this is Yevhen Klopotenko's recipe with a more modern twist, as we all know that YouTubers always feel the need to add random stuff to the recipe - he can only hope my baba will not find him to give him a good *prochuhana* (thrashing) for altering traditional recipes!:

**Ingredients:**

* 100-150 g of mushrooms
* 450 ml of milk - full fat
* 150 g of cornmeal
* 100 ml of apple or wine vinegar
* 200 ml of water
* 1 onion
* 20 g butter
* Sunflower oil for sautéing mushrooms
* 1 tbsp of sour cream
* 50 g of hard cheese (could use cheddar or blue cheese - don't tell baba)
* Salt and pepper to taste

**Recipe:**

1. Prepare the onion: cut it into thin half-rings and transfer it to a bowl. Pour 100 ml of apple cider vinegar, and 200 ml of cold water into it, and add a pinch of salt. Leave the onions to marinate for 30 minutes.
2. Wash and cut the mushrooms into medium strips. You can choose small mushrooms, then you don't need to cut them.
3. Heat a pan with 20g of butter and 1 tbsp of sunflower oil. Sauté the mushrooms for about 3-4 minutes.
4. Prepare corn grits according to the instruction on the packaging. Add salt to taste.
5. Add 1 tbsp of sour cream to the finished porridge. If you want to make the banosh lighter and easier to digest (as not all of us have an iron belly of Hutsuls) use low-fat sour cream. Mix the porridge with sour cream until smooth.
6. Take a deep plate for serving. Divide the banosh into two portions. Transfer the first portion of porridge to a plate, and add coarsely grated hard cheese. Do not mix.
7. Put the second portion of porridge on the cheese - this way it will melt. And on top of the cheese add mushrooms and then onions.
8. Serve immediately - it needs to still be hot.

According to Klopotenko, for banosh, you will need cornmeal of a medium grind. It becomes very tender during cooking, and the grains come together to form a smoother consistency.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Very important!** Banosh is a dish that is **served hot and does not tolerate reheating**, so do not count on leftovers. If you do, I am sure [Domovyk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ukraine/comments/v6jgmm/448_eest_the_sun_is_rising_on_the_104th_day_of/will) will be super upset with you and will create some mischief at your home for squandering a perfectly good banosh!

1i9f59q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1i9f59q/asking_a_coworker_out/,Asking a co-worker out.,"I (33m) have a crush on my (22f) co-worker. In the year and a half that I have worked there, I immediately found her attractive. 

I never flirted too hard and held back on asking her out, because if she would have said “no”, work would feel uncomfortable.

Last week, she put her two weeks notice. Next week is her last day. I’m going to ask her out, at least for like a coffee or some lunch. If she declines, I’m not going to get offended or mad. It’ll be a little heartbreaking lol, but hey, life moves on. 

My two questions for advice are:

1.Should I ask for a coffee date or a casual lunch date?

2. If she says no. What should I say? I know I’ll probably never see her again if she declines. So I’ll wish her the best on her future endeavors. ",0,1737779669.0,Advice,4,0.5,False
1i9f50k,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1i9f50k/beyond_the_hard_data_how_to_gauge_someone_in_am/,Beyond the Hard Data: How to gauge someone in AM?,"In the case of an AM, it is difficult to know a potential partner beyond hard data, such as looks, education, career, wealth, family background, caste, creed, etc. I agree that these are basic hygiene factors for first-level filtering. However, in my experience, we often stick with these hard facts, thinking they are enough to make a go-or-no-go decision.

Here’s the thing: Looks fade, careers can change, and wealth is… well, let's just say your in-laws’ money isn't legally yours anyway. So how do you figure out if this person is actually, you know, **liveable**?

# The Real Checklist:

Forget the glamor shots and job titles for a second. The whole point of getting married is to have someone who’s got your back—a partner who’s mature, stable, kind, and doesn’t make you want to run after every small fight.

But how do you figure all that out when all you’ve got is some Insta-worthy selfies and a family bio that reads like a LinkedIn profile? Here’s the cheat sheet:

**Don’t Be a Yes Machine**

Met them twice and are already imagining your wedding hashtag? Chill. People are on their best behavior at first. It's all smiles, charm, and maybe an “I love long walks on the beach” lie. Wait until they’re comfortable enough to let their inner gremlin show.

**Know Thyself**

Ask yourself: Am I relaxed and positive, or am I basically a sarcastic meme in human form? Self-awareness is hot. If you don’t know how you vibe, how will you know if their vibe matches yours?

**Watch Their Moves**

Pay attention to how they act in social settings. Are they cracking jokes, being polite, and just vibing? Or are they walking around like an overworked manager at 7 PM on a Friday?

**What’s Their Focus?**

Are they all about themselves—complaining about their boss, their back pain, their family drama or worse, their ex — or are they actually interested in *you*? Are they curious about you as a ""human being?"" Or, they are just asking yes-no questions and ticking a checkbox in their mind? Bonus points if they ask follow-up questions or make you laugh. Red flag if they’re basically the human version of a Twitter rant.

**The Ultimate Test: Are You Having Fun?**

Are you vibing? Laughing? Feeling that little *sparkle sparkle*? Or are you low-key plotting your exit strategy mid-coffee? Trust your gut—it knows more than you think.

# The Reality Check

Here’s the deal: What you see is what you get. People don’t magically become *chill* or *mature* later. If they’re super grumpy, intense, explosive or controlling now, they’ll probably still be that way when you’re deciding whose turn it is to buy the grocery.

Marriage is all about trade-offs. You won’t get the whole package (*unless you’re Beyoncé, in which case, hi Queen*). But know where you’re okay with compromising and where you’re not.

October 22nd, 1993 - Santa Fe, NM

The Woolworth's lunch counter in Santa Fe. A bastion of normalcy amidst the swirling chaos I've been subjected to. Or so one would hope. I took up a booth with a clear view of the entrance, ostensibly to observe any… fluctuations. Truthfully, it was to maintain an edge against the gnawing anxiety that had taken root since Siouxsie's (Like ""And The Banshees"", apparently. I been spelling it ""Suzie"" this entire time) frantic call to my show and her equally urgent followups on random payphones. I was still bewildered at how she managed to catch me when I was near them.

I nursed a lukewarm coffee, the taste not entirely dissimilar to burnt plastic, and observed the midday crowd. Tourists mostly, decked out in ludicrous amounts of turquoise. The kind that make locals roll their eyes. Then, my gaze landed on a figure hunched over a mountain of waffles and a truly alarming quantity of crisp bacon. Small frame, completely swallowed by an oversized black hoodie. One might have mistaken it for a child, demolishing a breakfast that would give even the most ardent lumberjack pause.

I waited. Siouxsie was due any minute. This… child, though, was certainly making a statement. The way the tiny, fabric-covered hands expertly maneuvered a forkful of syrup-drenched waffle into the unseen maw beneath the hood was almost hypnotic. I found myself wondering if this was some new, remarkably efficient method of resource depletion I hadn't encountered. Perhaps a juvenile cryptid with an insatiable sweet tooth? The sheer volume was… noteworthy.

A cough broke my reverie. A tall woman with tired eyes and a no-nonsense aura stood beside the booth. Dr. Eliza Vance. I straightened, a mild surprise flickering behind my spectacles. Before I could formulate a greeting, a small, fabric-draped hand tugged at Vance’s sleeve. The hooded figure from the counter.

“Count Jim?” a muffled voice emanated from beneath the black fabric. “Took you long enough. Though you’re be easy to spot in your getup.”

My gaze narrowed. The voice was undeniably Siouxsie’s, albeit slightly distorted by the layers of fabric. I confess, a flicker of… bewilderment crossed my stoic facade. “Siouxsie?” I inquired, my voice measured.

This was a turn. I was half expecting Vance to be this mysterious nerve-wracked voice on the phone that's been haunting me. Not this... munchkin.

The hoodie bobbed. “Surprise! Turns out, hitchhiking with a former NAORC scientist is faster than waiting for you to drive all the way from Sisterfuckersville.”

Former NAORC scientist. Things just keep getting better.

Vance offered a wry smile. “It's a long drive from Thurber, Siouxsie. Though I admit, the full ‘Count Jim’ regalia is… striking in broad daylight.”

“Right?” the muffled voice agreed. “Like he just stepped off the set of some low-budget vampire Western. You only wear that for the show, right? Please tell me you don’t grocery shop like this.”

My hand instinctively went to the brim of my hat. “Hey, my outfit is stylish and… functional. And it serves as a… recognizable symbol.”

Siouxsie snorted, a surprisingly loud sound considering her size. “Yeah, a symbol of ‘please ask me about my cable access show.’”

“Alright, you two,” Vance interjected, a hint of amusement in her tone. “Let’s focus. We have a lot to discuss.” She slid into the booth opposite me, and with a final, triumphant scrape of a fork against ceramic, Siouxsie, still shrouded in the hoodie, settled beside her.

Vance leaned forward, her expression serious. “Siouxsie is a good acquaintence of mine. She figured you could use my help. I have information, disturbing information, about the NAORC. And about a project they’re running in collaboration with… your associates.”

My jaw tightened. “Yes. The EOTO. The NAORC is placing nice with us for the time being.”

“Specifically,” Vance continued, her voice dropping, “Both organizations keeping tabs on the Waxahachie particle accelerator. The guys in charge there are not just smashing atoms, Jim. They’re… attempting something far more ambitious. Something involving temporal manipulation. And according to Siouxsie, it’s not going well.”

Siouxsie shifted, the fabric of her sleeves rustling. “Not going well is an understatement. Think… messing with things that should not be messed with. And guess who’s right in the middle of it?”

The weight of her words settled heavily in the air. The burnt plastic taste of the coffee seemed to intensify.

Suddenly, the bell above the diner door chimed, announcing new arrivals. Two men, both broad-shouldered and possessing that unsettlingly vacant gaze I’d become familiar with in my tenure with the EOTO. NAORC operatives.

“Company,” I stated, my voice low.

Siouxsie stiffened beside me. “They’re… looking for someone small. And probably someone who smells faintly of waffle batter.”

“Time to go,” Vance said, already sliding out of the booth.

As I rose, I felt a tug on my coat. Siouxsie. “Hold tight,” she whispered, her voice no longer muffled.

Before I could react, she moved. A blur of black fabric, faster than anything I could have anticipated. One moment she was beside me, the next she was halfway to the exit, weaving through tables with an impossible agility. The pursuing men, momentarily stunned by her speed, stumbled over a discarded tray.

And then, something truly remarkable happened. As she reached the door, a ripple seemed to distort the air around her. For a split second, she wasn’t quite… there. More like a flicker on a faulty television screen. Then she was gone, the door swinging shut behind her.

Vance and I exchanged a look. Even through my red-tinted lenses, I could see the shock mirrored in her eyes. Something was undeniably… different about Siouxsie.

We made our escape through the back exit, less dramatically but no less urgently. Siouxsie was already waiting in the alley, leaning against a dumpster, the oversized hoodie still concealing her features.

“Show off,” I muttered, though a grudging respect was beginning to form.

“Had to make an impression,” she replied, a hint of that sly wit I’d heard in her voice earlier. A far cry from her tense anxious pleas over the phone.

A decommissioned NAORC facility outside of Los Alamos became our next destination. Maybe we could find something of use there. Vance worked there in the past and knew its layout; Siouxsie possessed… abilities of some sort apparantely. And I, well, I had... vague... experience with the unpleasant things NAORC liked to keep hidden.

But that can wait till tomorrow. I was overdue for a nap and a shower. We headed to the crappy motel I booked.

Later, while Siouxsie was boredly flipping throught he channels on the motel TV while demolishing an entire pizza, Vance was out getting supplies, and I was sound asleep in a chair, the satellite link on my laptop pinged and woke me up from my slumber. A text message from an anonymous Count Jim BBS user. The words were simple, chillingly so: \[The Red Inquisitioner knows\]. Inquisitor. It has to be the scary dude in the pointy hood.

The implications hung in the air, thick and suffocating. The hunt was on. And we were the prey.",1,1737779565.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Upgrading from a old Rav4 that's been a tank.  Went to local dealership and test drove a 2025 x5 and really liked the quietness and power but definitely don't love the high price tag.  I did a built there at the dealership for a base X40i with $1300 add ons and 1175 destination charge. After 2% dealer discount and 4k Veteran discount, I'm looking at $71,473.   I haven't done any bargaining.  I have the money and would pay cash but I just can't bare the thought of spending that much on a car and instantly having it lose value.   I don't need bells and whistles.

Today I saw they had 2022 x40i in Manhattan Green and Coffee interior with 35k miles.  I love the color combo.  Premium package, climate and comfort, parking assist and upgraded 20"" wheels for $46,000.  2 previous owners, no major repairs, it had a electrical wiring repair a yr ago.  It doesn't hurt my man feelings if I buy a used.  I love a great deal.  Yea I would love new but even though I have plenty of money, my frugal upbringing just can't justify such an expensive price tag for new.

We have a large population of homeless people in our city, and they frequent his church because that church often hands out clothes and food. Which doesn't bother me, of course, I'm glad they're doing something... But what bothers me is when the homeless people aren't the *good little quiet homeless* that they want them to be, then the ""security"" at the church gets pissy. I'm not talking about people committing crimes and such. Obviously, I understand if they'd have to intervene there. 

I mean, there are people who are clearly mentally ill who come in and talk to themselves in the back and are told to leave because they're disrupting the service, they have hygiene issues so they're told to move away from everyone, they only want to sit in the lobby and drink coffee and eat muffins so they're told to go to service or leave - yes, they tell the homeless people to go to service even if its obvious they just want some food and a warm/cool place to sit - or generally just not behaving like the church expects people to behave. 

I've heard him mock a woman who came in one day. He said she looked hungry and sickly. She told them that God had told her they should give her the offering that day because she is homeless and starving. Granted, she became agitated when they said no and was probably making a scene, but wouldn't you be if you were in her position? Hungry, cold, lonely, sick, desperate? The kind of person that Jesus would maybe say to help? But of course, instead of giving this woman any kind of money, food, or resources, they forced her outside, called the police, and had her trespassed from the property. 

I work in mental health. I used to work on a crisis unit in a psych hospital that received a lot of involuntarily admitted patients (72 hour holds and such). I *know* and have seen firsthand that the majority of homeless people in our city are mentally ill or struggling with addiction. On top of this, the cops here won't hesitate to stop and tear apart someone's grocery cart filled with their belongings, or arrest them for ""sleeping in a public place,"" which is literally a charge I saw one of my former patients catch. Our only shelter is always full. They have cots to put on the floor for when the weather is extreme, and that still isn't enough for how many people need help. This population NEEDS a safe haven, and you would think that Christians would want to be that. But no.

Of course, it's been brought up, ""well we aren't trained to handle severely mentally ill people."" But supposedly, their ""security team"" is trained to handle an active shooter. Which one do they come across more often, do you think? 

When I try to bring any of this up with my dad, I am completely shut down. It's so infuriating. ",13,1737779387.0,exchristian,0,0.94,False

However, in my experience, we often stick with these hard facts, thinking they are enough to make a go-or-no-go decision.

Here’s the thing: Looks fade, careers can change, and wealth is… well, let's just say your in-laws’ money isn't legally yours anyway. So how do you figure out if this person is actually, you know, **liveable**?

# The Real Checklist:

Forget the glamor shots and job titles for a second. The whole point of getting married is to have someone who’s got your back—a partner who’s mature, stable, kind, and doesn’t make you want to run after every small fight.

But how do you figure all that out when all you’ve got is some Insta-worthy selfies and a family bio that reads like a LinkedIn profile? Here’s the cheat sheet:

**Don’t Be a Yes Machine**

Met them twice and are already imagining your wedding hashtag? Chill. People are on their best behavior at first. It's all smiles, charm, and maybe an “I love long walks on the beach” lie. Wait until they’re comfortable enough to let their inner gremlin show

**Know Thyself**

Ask yourself: Am I relaxed and positive, or am I basically a sarcastic meme in human form? Self-awareness is hot. If you don’t know how you vibe, how will you know if their vibe matches yours?

**Watch Their Moves**

Pay attention to how they act in social settings. Are they cracking jokes, being polite, and just vibing? Or are they walking around like an overworked manager at 7 PM on a Friday?

**What’s Their Focus?**

Are they all about themselves—complaining about their boss, their back pain, their family drama or worse, their ex — or are they actually interested in *you*? Are they curious about you as a ""human being?"" Or, they are just asking yes-no questions and ticking a checkbox in their mind? Bonus points if they ask follow-up questions or make you laugh. Red flag if they’re basically the human version of a Twitter rant.

**The Ultimate Test: Are You Having Fun?**

Are you vibing? Laughing? Feeling that little *sparkle sparkle*? Or are you low-key plotting your exit strategy mid-coffee? Trust your gut—it knows more than you think.

# The Reality Check

Here’s the deal: What you see is what you get. People don’t magically become *chill* or *mature* later. If they’re super grumpy, intense, explosive or controlling now, they’ll probably still be that way when you’re deciding whose turn it is to buy the grocery.

Marriage is all about trade-offs. You won’t get the whole package (*unless you’re Beyoncé, in which case, hi Queen*). But know where you’re okay with compromising and where you’re not.

TL;DR: Take your time, pay attention, and don’t leave your future happiness up to “luck.” Unless your idea of luck is rolling the dice on someone who can’t stop talking about their ex’s dog. 🐕‍🦺

That left me with some doubt, because in my opinion when you write a character sometimes you change all his past, all the background that made him who he is now, and if you change that, you change the whole structure of the character already made. So, I'll give as an example Sasuke from Naruto, (it doesn't matter if you don't know him, I'll explain) a guy who is emo, dark and calculating for losing everything to his brother, that's what makes him everything he is, his past, his mistakes, his traumas, but if we move Sasuke to a universe (fanfic) where that never happened he might still be the same, it wouldn't make so much sense, he would probably be just a boy, who is loved and has a lot of talent, maybe he is a bit egocentric and chatty, we don't know, he would probably make different decisions than his original version, choose peace before a path of death and destruction, he might make friends with characters we would never think he could be friends with or maybe he likes different things, all that affects the construction of a fanfic, changing the whole past (or even changing the universe, for example a coffee shop fanfic) of a character is almost the same as starting from scratch, just with a name and a pre-made appearance, and the point I wanted to get to is what do you think? Do you think that the best thing for a story is to keep it as close as possible to the original character or should it be thought to fit with what has happened to the character in your story, how it should change its actions with respect to the original? Do you hate it when authors do that because it seems too OC to you? Please respond, I'll be happy to read. I hope I've explained myself well.

Hi! I talk ALOT so this is super long but please read if there’s even a chance you can help me feel better 😭 This may be kind if niche but im a 5’5 Female 22 years old and after a breakup (so partially not trying) and super busy college semester I lost close to 25 pounds. I was normal weight at the time and honestly just got more skinny but it made me feel so much more confident (especially since my super fit family always called me chubby for like 12 years of my life even though I have always been pretty slim😭). Losing those 25 pounds honestly stopped the comments my parents would make and that really strengthened my relationship with them and also just my own personal self image issues I felt so much more confident with a slimmer face and more toned body. 

I dont wanna use weight numbers because I dont want people to make judgements on my body but at my highest I was at like the 22% percentile for weight in my age and height group so I have honestly never been remotely close to a chubby or much less an unhealthy weight. Which finally brings me to my point. I feel like it is so much harder to lose weight from an average weight to a lower one. 

Recently, I graduated college and have been living w my family for about 1.5 months now and I have gained 10 pounds. I cannot stop the late night snacking I have no idea what to do Ive read all the reddit posts for brushing teeth for high protein huge breakfast for tracking calories for tea for coffee for fizzy drinks like I legit dont know what to do. I workout everyday (for fun) and it just feels like theres no point to it sometimes because at the end of the night I cannot escape the Costco sized snacks in my family of 5’s house. Were also Indian so the food usually has alot of oil which I try to avoid but my mom’s cooking is amazing so I end up snacking way too much on her food in addition to the healthy food I already make. 

In college I didnt keep snacks in the house I truly could not go all out like I do back at home. I also cannot talk to my family about this and get rid if the snacks like thats just not a possibility they would probably just get upset that I am restricting (ironic bc they used to fat shame tf out of me lol, if ur indian yktv) and like thats a whole other can of worms to deal with them.  I genuinely dont know how to stop the snacking I will legit eat like dates, cashews, random indian food, desserts, cereal, fruit, etc. solely because I love food. I eat such a big high protein breakfast I eat lunch I am not even hungry I just truly love food and cannot control myself around so much good food. 

Gaining 10 pounds on my already smaller frame makes such a drastic difference in my eyes and has made me less confident wearing leggings or just any outfits that are form fitting anymore. This is really hard for me because fashion is such a big part of my life and so is clothes. I just dont feel confident anymore and I genuinely dont know how to lose the weight because of the snacking/love for food and also because it is just so so  hard to go from relatively small to smaller. Like calorie deficit wise my BMR is 1200 (my tdee is obvi higher but i lowkey dont believe working out offsets that many calories 😭 i prob burn 400-500 ish calories for 2 hours of working out 💀 so not much plus all those studies that say working out isnt significant for weight loss).  

Overall I feel so bad about myself and genuinely dont know how to go back to the weight I was comfortable and confident at :( Also, I keep as busy as I possibly can. I picked up a part time job just for the meantime before I move out of home in March and I do errands around the house about 1-2 workout classes a day because I love Trufusion lol and hangout with my family and friends and read so many books so I dont know why I cant control myself around all the amazing food here its driving me nuts ! I just want to feel like myself and confident again and I just dont know how to be disciplined or where to start and I am really scared that if I keep snacking everyday and indulging everyday I will go back to my very original weight which would really really depress me :( ",0,1737778649.0,loseit,3,0.33,False
