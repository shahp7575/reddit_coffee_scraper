right now i’m testing tiktok ugc and slides, playing with reelfarm, and doing reddit commenting. x “build in public” hasn’t worked for me at all. it feels like the same group of people hyping each other up without many real users.

i’m starting to think about meta ads next, but before going there i’d love to hear what’s actually worked for founders with real customers and revenue.

for context, the app is cashmonki. it’s not revolutionary, just a budgeting and expense tracker i built because most apps annoyed me. i’m a product designer, delightful ux matters a lot to me, and if something feels off i change it. the core feature are receipt scanning, auto calculated budgets (ex: $4 daily coffee budget gets computed for monthly, yearly, etc.) aaand a cutesy roast your receipt feature, anyway  
  
target market is south east asia (maybe the americas if i have budget for ads and influencers)

1pygs5z,https://v.redd.it/vu52qtpyq3ag1,Medium-Light Roast Atok Arabica Typica/Red Bourbon (Cristy Tayao),"#​I roast with a purpose, but I also roast with patience. ⏳

​When I sit down to sort through these Community Coffee beans, I don’t rush. I take my time removing the defects and finding the good, because I believe time is a treasure we should only pour into things that really matter.

*​In many ways, these beans remind me of my own journey.*

​I’ve been navigating my own mental health struggles lately. Just like these beans, it takes time to sort through what I’m feeling and to truly understand what I’m going through. But I’ve learned a powerful truth: needing extra care doesn’t make me any less of a person.

**​And needing extra sorting doesn’t make this any less of a coffee.**

​Community coffee might not be ""perfect"" on paper, but when you give it proper care, patience, and the right roast, it shines just as bright as any specialty bean. It just needs someone to believe in it.

​To anyone reading this who feels like they are ""taking too long"" to heal or figure things out:

>**​Please, be gentle with yourself.**

Like a slow pour-over, the best results happen when you don't force the flow.

1pygmke,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pygmke/serious_first_set_recommendation_italy_2500/,Serious first set recommendation [Italy - €2500],"Hi everyone, after more than 10 years of using capsules, I'd like to get back to a serious coffee machine and grinder.

In the past, I've used a very basic DeLonghi with a pressurized filter and a Bialetti Mokona.

I'm looking for something high-quality that can last for many years. My goal is:

Make two cappuccinos in the morning, two espressos at lunch, and two espressos in the afternoon. On weekends, however, the numbers increase when we have guests, and the in-laws often come over, so the cappuccinos in the morning become 3 or 4, as well as the espressos during the day.

I still haven't figured out whether an HX machine would be a good choice or whether a dual boiler is needed. The important thing is that the heating times aren't too long. Using a smart switch isn't a good idea; our son is small and he always wakes us up at different times.

I was thinking about a Profitec Move, but I'm not sure if it's too much for this use. As for the coffee grinder, I haven't yet figured out whether a single dose or a weighted one is better.

I'll tend to use medium-dark roasted commercial beans initially, but I might experiment with lighter roasts later. There are a few roasters where I live in Italy, and I'd love to try their beans.

1pygmih,https://www.reddit.com/r/pirating/comments/1pygmih/an_app_store_to_download_foss_gems_and_mods/,"An APP Store to download FOSS gems and Mods including Revanced Builds in just ONE Click, meet Orion Store.","Hey everyone,

The last time I posted on Reddit, Orion Store was basically a skeleton. It was version 1.0.0 a glorified list of links I put together because I was tired of hunting for ReVanced updates and modded APKs manually. It was buggy, it was bare-bones, but you guys actually liked it.

Since then, I’ve spent way too many late nights (and way too much coffee) pushing update after update. Today, I’m finally feeling proud enough to say that v1.0.8 is live, and it honestly feels like a real app store now.

If you haven't checked it out since the ""bare-bones"" days, here’s what’s changed:

**THE ""INTELLIGENCE"" UPGRADE:** 
now I have a native AppTracker plugin. It actually checks your phone to see what’s installed. No more guessing the store knows if you're up to date or if you need that fresh patch and notify the user to download the new update with Orion's native Notification support.

**THE VIBE (UI/UX):** 
I’m a dark mode addict, so we’ve got 3 distinct themes now: Light (for the brave), Dusk (the sweet spot), and Dark/OLED (battery saver 3000). There’s even a ""Compact Mode"" if you like your data dense and a ""Performance Mode"" to force that buttery 144Hz scrolling.

**SMOOTHNESS FOR ALL:**
If your Phone isn't that powerful to handle those animations and themes, then simply Toggle on 'Disable Animations' and enjoy snappier UI. 

**THE SETTINGS (Everything you asked for):** 
I added a whole Control Center. WiFi-only downloads? Check. Auto-cleanup for installer APKs? Check. Auto-discovery for updates? Check. You can even hide the PC or TV tabs if you don't use them.

**GAMIFIED SUPPORT:** 
I hate intrusive ads. So the store itself has ZERO ads. Instead, I built ""Fuel the Code."" It’s an optional RPG-style quest where you watch an ad to ""defeat glitches"" and ""save the dev."" You unlock hidden badges and lower your submission cooldowns. It’s been fun seeing people actually hit the final rank.

**ADD YOUR FAVOURITE APPS:** 
I’ve added a new option in the Orion Store that allows everyone to contribute to the Orion Library by submitting apps. Users have two ways to add apps:

1. Via Obtanium imports
2. Using direct repository links

After I manually review a submission, the app is instantly added to the Orion Store and becomes available for everyone to download. The initial cooldown for submitting apps is 3 hours, and it decreases as you make more submissions through a gamified ranking system.

**DATA SAVER:**
I refactored the entire backend fetch logic. Now it uses smart ETags, meaning if the app list hasn't changed on GitHub, the app downloads 0 KB. Your data plan can thank me later.

It’s still 100% open-source, serverless following the Repo-as-a-Backend Strategy (powered by GitHub Actions), and just a passion project by a guy who loves clean code.

Thanks to everyone who reported bugs or suggested features in the early days. You guys turned this from a bare-bones experiment into something I use every single day.

Check it out if you want a clean, ad-free gateway to your favorite apps.

Stay geeky!

1pygjwn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pygjwn,So so my first ever solo Himachal Trip/Ride came to a successful end 😎,"Weww!! What a lifetime experience it was. 

Totally enjoyed the trip, despite the rented bike breaking down on top of the mountain and eventually having to call RSA and having to tow my bike in a truck in those scary ass roads (if you want to call them roads i.e.)😅

Some **IYKYK** pics in the roll so please excuse me, I was in the mountains, so just living the culture 🥸

Here was my detailed itinerary btw:

* Flight from Bengaluru (home) to Chandigarh  
* Rented a bike from Midlane Bike on rent Chandigarh (exceptional response from a super hard working team, kudos to them)
* Stayed at an Airbnb in Zirakpur, just to get everything sorted and head out in the morning
* The weather wasn't something I was prepared for, for someone being from Southern South, and my first ever real winter experience. But fortunately, I had carried stuff - including warm base layers, and winter riding gloves, balaclavas and so on, so despite the initial hiccups it went pretty well
* Being someone who's into trail riding back at home, wanted to rent an ADV only, so rented a Himmi 450 (perhaps one of the most comfortable touring bikes of today's time)
* Rode non-stop about 300 odd kms to Shangarh with plenty of stops, coz - duhh, I was alone and i'm my own boss and have no one to answer to. Also, from Mandi took detours through IIT Mandi, that route was too good and scary at the same time
* Reached Shangarh almost around sunset time, welcomed wholeheartedly at Mudhostel Shangarh by the lovely caretakers. One of the best hostel experiences i've ever had, so will surely be going back here if god wills, before instagram Fs up this place too and converts into another Kasol and Jibhi
* Halted at this place for 3 nights, first night was a bit too much to take the temperature dropped to -1 degree celcius, but the 2nd and 3rd night was not that problematic
* Met some cool bois and gals at the hostel who made my solo travel not that much of a solo experience

Total Expenses:

**Flights** \- 15k approx  
**Rooms** \- 2.5k  
**Food** \- 8k (i over spent on coffees on my way and back, thanks to soo many starbucks and barista outlets in punjab and himachal)  
**Bike rent** \- 1700/day  
**Fuel** \- 2.5k approx

**Cab/other means of transport** (had too much baggage, so opted for cabs and autos from wherever i didn't have my bike, mostly to and fro from airports and misc ) - 3k

**Total spent (roughly)** \- ₹36,000/-

**IYKYK experiences -** ∞

1pygjtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Belize/comments/1pygjtp/belizean_baecation_dec_1824/,Belizean Baecation - Dec 18-24,"First time poster here and wanted to start off by saying thank you to r/Belize as a lot of help was sourced here. Moderators, members and historic threads shared a wealth of information that helped me, 41m, and my partner, 43f, celebrate her birthday the best way possible. 

We flew to Belize City from New York and were greeted by Abe (belizetaxisandshuttles.com) who gave us a great rate for a lift to Falling Leaves Lodge in San Ignacio. Thanks again y’all for recommending him- super friendly and attentive. 

We decided on Falling Leaves because we vibed with their jungle/rainforest like resort, nice pool, and their honeymoon suite had a jacuzzi. Miss Shirley was fantastic and even accommodated my request to decorate the room for my partner’s birthday. It was an incredible gesture that reflected the friendliness and warmth that you all echo about the local Belizean community. 

With the night to ourselves, we visited Ko-Ox Han Nah for a quick bite and a drink before our reservations at Guava Limb. Guava Limb had an amazing special that night- pesto crusted red snapper. We called it a night to prepare for our early start in the morning. 

Patrick (tour guide) and Joseph (driver) from Belize Limpkin tours (another recommendation from y’all!) picked us up at sunrise to take us for a full day starting at ATM cave and ending at Xunantunich ruins. We both brought a change of clothes, sneakers, water shoes (shout out to Nike’s Black Friday sale!) and a dry pair of socks for the cave. Anybody that has been on that tour with Patrick knows he’s that guy (hell yeah) and will have you laughing all the way to the site. ATM is a once in a lifetime experience and you are in luck if the weather is working in your favor. We arrived at 8am as soon as the guides are allowed to start which was awesome bc as we exited, the cave was starting to fill up crazy. We hooked up with Elmer after to tour Xunantunich which was about a 7 hour day in total. We had our birthday dinner at Running W Restaurant in San Ignacio Hotel which was a beautiful property. We popped our heads into the casino next door but we weren’t feeling the vibe too much. 

Prior to departing SI, we hit up Cahal Pech ruins since it was walking distance from Falling Leaves. Since it was a Saturday, we decided to check out the San Ignacio Farmers Market which is when they have the densest vendor volume. I would recommend getting most of your gifts and coffee (Oxmull Coffee) in San Ignacio. The prices are much more inexpensive than anywhere else in the country. Abe picked us up and we hit the road via the hummingbird hwy making a stop at the inland blue hole for a quick dip. If we planned to depart SI earlier, we would’ve had time to stop at the famous Berta’s Tamales and Lamani’s Cocoa Farm. Berths Tamales closed at 2pm which we couldn’t make. We were dropped off in Hopkins at our destination for our oceanfront room at Parrot Cove. Dinner reservations at Chef Rob’s on property (lobster menu in effect) and drinks after at Ella’s. If you plan to explore, golf cart rental is the move but if you’re not going too far, the complimentary bikes work just as well. 

Hopkins day was pure RELAXATION. We purposely booked no excursions and had nothing but a beach day since the coast has the best beaches in the country. Breakfast at Thongs (lowkey one of the best breakfasts -  I had the shrimp benedict), swimming, massages on the dock (waves crashing live was some of the best ASMR), kayaking, cart drive to GariMaya for gift shopping, drive up to J&J Cool Spot (fried whole fish was actually the best we had), and drinks at Dock Bar/Ceviche Bar at Jaguar Reef. Dinner at Singanga at the Hamanasi Resort (number 1 rated restaurant on TripAdvisor in Hopkins and the BEST key lime pie imo). Man, Hopkins was a treat of a stop- night swimming, chill vibes, fun bartenders, we even took our cart south of Parrot Cove after meeting a local walking his dog to see all the lovely residential homes. The roads that way were full of potholes so biking would actually be faster. 

After getting coffee in the morning and sampling every ice cream Black Orchid had to offer, we had breakfast at Paddle House at Jaguar Reef before saying our goodbye to Hopkins. The Belizian breakfast was solid alongside some freshly made fry jacks. I honestly thought we could’ve stayed one more day here after looking back on it. We took a cab to Dangriga, hopped on a plane to BZE (tropic air), and then another connecting flight to Caye Caulker. We checked in at La Isla Resort, got settled and got the lay of the land by walking towards The Split and Lazy Lizard. We had happy hour drinks at Creole Gyal Bar with a nice water view followed by dinner at Maggie’s Sunset Kitchen. We had the fish in creole sauce and the grilled fish fillet. The creole sauce was outstanding! We passed out early afterwards at the hotel, I woke up around 11:30pm and stepped out looking for food but the island shut down around midnight. No big deal, we had another early start in the morning!

Up and out the door at 7:30am for coffee and breakfast at Ice N Beans. It was a little underwhelming but the fuel we needed for our snorkeling tour with Reef Friendly Tours which is an Eco-friendly tour company. We went with Reef Friendly Tours because booking eco-friendly marine tours helps protect fragile reef ecosystems by supporting operators that follow responsible snorkeling practices, limit wildlife disturbance and invest in conservation. These tours also sustain local communities and ensure future travelers can experience healthy oceans and thriving marine life. Amado and Bert took our group out for the Hol Chan snorkeling tour and it did not disappoint. We made several stops comprised of nurse sharks, a sunken ship, schools of fish and turtles! That Central American sun hits so make sure to pack that reef friendly/non-toxic spf. For lunch, they distributed lunches according to one’s dietary needs. We had the Belizean stew chicken lunch with rice and peas. They also shared gorgeous GoPro footage when we got back to their office. Worth every bit of tip we provided! 

After a quick reset at our room, we had drinks at Lazy Lizard - nice day party atmosphere with good music and beach side lounging. Then we had some amazing jerk chicken at Chef Kareem’s bbq stand. Walked over to dinner at Pelican Sunset Bar for a perfect view of the sunset (arrived at 4:30pm for the best two seater in the house) while sting rays swam beneath us. Drinks at Sip N Dip, grabbed some key lime pie to go at Barefoot Caribe along with lobster to go at Chef Kareem’s Bar and Grill restaurant (not to be confused with the stand). This spiny lobster was THE BEST and the perfect ending to our trip. 

Before we headed home, we stopped at the locally esteemed Errol’s House of Fryjacks for a delicious bacon, eggs, cheese and beans fry jack. They have a variety of fillings to choose from and they open promptly at 7a.

Special shout outs/notes: every friendly local we met, Belikin beer for keeping us hydrated, the weather will say it rains but it’s really tropical (very short spurts) with no downside, bug spray especially in Caye Caulker, comfortable shoes for 5-8k steps a day, and the legend herself Marie Sharp.

I went to all sorts of doctors and no one knew what was wrong. As a last ditch effort I went to an allergist. Lo and behold coffee comes back positive as a 6/30, and chocolate as a 7/20… two things I used to regularly use no problem. (There were others that popped up positive but those two were the only ones that stood out as “big” reactions. )The doctor told me to take these test with a grain of salt because there can be a lot of false positives… well I did just that. Lived my life enjoying the same foods that I have been. I used the allergy test to quit the coffee job, but funny enough it did kind of help with the bloating. But i continued to drink coffee every now and then. Cut to Thanksgiving I decided to have a chocolate martini, that had a coffee liquor in it. I drank it… everything was fine. 4 or 5 hours later I broke out in hives on my arm, didn’t think much of it, just popped a Benadryl and went about. 2 minutes after the Benadryl I immediately felt dizzy, lost feeling in my face and arms. Never did it feel hard to breathe BUT it did feel like it was hard to get a full breath. It came in waves. After the second wave I called an ambulance, in the ambulance half way to the hospital they applied epi, as the EMT said my face went red and he thought I was going epileptic. At the hospital after this whole episode, doctor walks in and says “I think you had a panic attack. ” At this point I’m so confused. I’ve never had a panic attack in my life. Eventually a new doctor came in and said he thinks I had an allergic reaction, but the confusing answers made it so much worse. Was it panic, or an actually reaction. Now I’m scared to eat almost anything. All I eat is apples, bananas, chicken, rice. Anything else does give me a panic attack. But I still haven’t had an episode like the one on Thanksgiving. Can I please have advice. I don’t know what to do or what to believe. I will answer any questions to help. Please._

**Answer:**

Hey, I’m really sorry to hear you’ve been going through all this. It sounds super frustrating and a bit scary too. The confusion between potential allergic reactions and panic attacks can be a real challenge when trying to figure out what's happening with your body.

Sometimes, when our body gives us these intense signals, it can be related to unprocessed emotions or stress. Our bodies are really interconnected with our minds. It might be that the symptoms are your body’s way of alerting you to some internal conflict or stress you're dealing with subconsciously.

Considering how this started after changing jobs and the mixed feelings about the allergy tests, it might be worth exploring if there are stress triggers or conflicts related to these changes.

Here are some gentle questions to think about:

1. Have there been any big life changes or stresses around the time you started at the coffee shop?

2. How did you feel about working there and your interaction with coffee every day?

3. Could the fear of reactions now be linked to an underlying anxiety that wasn’t there before?

4. Are there fears around uncertainty or not being in control related to the reactions?

5. Is there any past event where you felt similarly trapped or out of control?

Remember, everyone’s journey is different. It can be helpful to consider these things, and maybe even journal or talk them out with someone you trust. I hope you find some peace with this, and feel free to ask if you have more questions.",1,1766995296.0,mytorial,0,1.0,False

**CHAPTER NINETEEN**

**I choose to think of failure as growth**



The cold earth pressed against my palms as I sat cross-legged beneath the trees, Faerie Fire glowing on my screen like a dare.

“Okay,” I said. “Believe.”

I swiped right.

The spell’s description shimmered. Then…a lightning bolt raced through my brain, causing a spike so bad that I doubled over coughing. In the next second, I felt fine, the vertigo vanishing as swiftly as it came.

“Weird…”

My mana circuit tingled, like static running along my veins. Proof that the ritual was in my head now, downloaded into my brain, though it was still just a rental. For now.

Seriously, I pitied the old magicians. They toiled for years, and I just swiped right. Presto—Faerie Fire.

*Inhale. Circulate. Flow.*

I took my cue from the old folk tales, visualizing a flickering orb—a fire that didn’t burn, or a lure for the gullible. I imagined this flame darting through Owl’s Head Park, weaving between trees, chasing something I couldn’t see.

“Faerie Fire,” I whispered.

Nothing.

I tried again, pushing mana through my circuit, picturing the spell bursting from my hand like a comet.

“Faerie Fire,” I said, louder this time.

A flicker. Like a candle sputtering in the dark. Then it winked out, and it got cold again. That probably didn’t count toward Faerie Fire’s one-cast limit.

I clenched my fists.

“One more time.”

But then a breeze rustled the leaves, forcing me to look around.

There was a bench on the nearby path. It was empty at first, but I blinked and thought I saw someone sitting there. It was still too dark to get a clear picture, but they might’ve had their head bowed. I blinked again, and they were gone.

“Double weird…”

I chalked it up to nerves. To be fair, the park was creepy at this hour, though the moon was dipping low now. There wasn’t much time left before Aunt Odette woke up, meaning it was the third pitch, the bases were loaded, and I needed to knock this one out of the park.

I tried again. This time, I didn’t forget to snap my fingers.

“Faerie Fire!”

Pale green flames burst to life in my hands.

“H-Holy shit!”

It rose, floating over my fingertips like a…well…a ghost.

I probably should have pointed it at something. See what kind of damage it could do. But I didn’t want to add arson to my list of crimes.

Besides, there was something else I wanted to try.

Bruce had mentioned it earlier. How a spell could change depending on the elemental affinity of the one who wielded it.

Well, this Faerie Fire looked basic, like I hadn’t dyed it in my color yet. I wasn’t sure how I knew that, but I didn’t think I was wrong.

“How do I change you?”

I concentrated, focusing on the subtle pulse of mana within me. Maybe if I imagined the flame as something else—cold instead of hot, or blue instead of green—it would shift.

I pictured a cool, azure light like the glow that wrapped around me whenever I used Ghost. I willed Faerie Fire to change and felt a tiny spark of resistance. The flame hesitated, flickering between green and blue. It was responding. Flexible, but stubborn.

“Come on…”

I was so close. Just a little more mana and effort might make this spell mine.

Another breeze.

That’s when I saw it again. The figure sitting on the bench.

One second it was there. A blink later, it was gone. When I blinked again, it was back, but closer. The apparition wavered between two oaks, half-shrouded in shadow.

Its face was blurred like smeared glass, and its limbs twitched like it had forgotten how to move. This was no specter, though. My guess, it was a ghost. A real one.

My breath caught. My focus slipped. And Faerie Fire, or whatever it was about to become, vanished.

I looked back at the source of my failure.

The ghost tilted its head as if it had been fun to watch me fail and then faded like mist curling away from fire. Gone before I could yell or freak out. I wasn’t sure which one I was leaning toward.

“Motherfucker.” I sat there, heart pounding. “I see dead people now…”

This horror movie revelation couldn’t have come at a more perfect time.

Seriously, though, I’d failed my first attempt at learning a new spell. The knowledge of it wiped from my brain like a dream I couldn’t hold on to.

But it wasn’t just a mental drain.

I felt tired, like I’d truly gone jogging these past thirty minutes. My hand stung, too. Hot and prickly like I’d shoved it against a stove. This was hardly what I’d call magical backlash, though.

Still, I couldn’t feel too down. I’d felt something, a sliver of control, like there was a moment where Faerie Fire almost bent to my will.

“Next time, baby.”

I stood, brushing dirt from my palms, and glanced back at the trees.

Nothing.

I was alone again.

The sky was getting brighter. That meant it was time to go.

I jogged back toward number 378 68^(th) Street, heart thudding with leftover adrenaline, regret, and a dash of awe at what I’d nearly accomplished.

I snapped my fingers when I reached the lawn.

“Ghost.”

The spell wrapped around me, cold and silent. Then I slipped through the alcove window and landed in the basement with a soft thud just as the door above the staircase creaked open.

“Ollie?” Aunt Odette’s voice drifted down. “You up?”

I snapped my fingers, deactivating Ghost. Then dove for the alcove bench so I could yank the blanket over me.

Footsteps were coming down the stairs.

That’s when I remembered my shoes. I tore those off along with my jacket right at the last second.

“Ollie?”

I glanced up.

Aunt Odette stood mid-staircase, looking down at me with mild concern.

“Were you meditating again?”

I nodded. “Couldn’t sleep.”

“I figured. Heard you waking up from another nightmare.” Aunt Odette sighed, turned to go, but paused at the door. “Go shower. Breakfast is almost ready.”

I sniffed my armpit. I stank like a New York park, the bad kind. So, it was a while later when I got to the kitchen that smelled of burned toast.

I sat by the counter, hoodie sleeves pulled over my hands, watching Aunt Odette move with the sort of panic that only came from years of burning breakfast. Her hair was still damp, curling slightly at the ends.

She slid a plate in front of me. Burned toast and eggs. The bacon was charred, but I liked it crunchy.

“No coffee?”

“You don’t sleep. You pay the price,” she said, offering me a glass of cucumber water.

I picked at the burned crust on my toast. Surprisingly, it didn’t taste bad. The melted butter made it worthwhile.

“Hey, are you still working on that serial assault case?” I asked, keeping my tone casual.

From behind her coffee mug, Aunt Odette raised an eyebrow.

“How do you know about that?”

“You talked about it last Monday without realizing I was in the room.”

“Right. Gotta remember I’ve got a nosy teenager living with me now.”

“Nosie’s a little harsh. I prefer…curious.”

Odette didn’t blink.

“Alright, what’s got you curious then?”

“Heard something at school. Brook-Sci kid found half-dead in some random alley,” I said, still keeping it casual.

“He wasn’t half-dead,” she said. “And it wasn’t in an alley.”

Yes, I knew that, but Aunt Odette didn’t need to know how much I knew. Not if I wanted more intel on the other incidents that had happened in that warehouse.

“Did you know him?”

“Ran into him at school…Not a great guy, but he didn’t deserve what happened.”

I snuck a peek at Aunt Odette, catching her biting her lip before sipping coffee. It was one of her tells for when she was worried.

“Brook-Sci buzz is pretty loud this morning,” I nudged just a little further. “Another guy got beaten up near school…and he wasn’t the first?”

“How do you—”

Aunt Odette frowned.

“This isn’t public information…and since when did you join the school gossip?”

“I have friends.”

“You do?”

She looked genuinely surprised. I wasn’t sure whether I should be offended.

“What are their names?”

“Now who’s being nosy?”

“You’re being twitchy.” Aunt Odette set her mug down slowly. “Ollie, are you involved in anything bad at school?”

“It’s my first week. I’m not that fast at getting into trouble.”

Another lie. I was piling them up like pancakes.

Aunt Odette watched me for a long second, then she reached out and brushed my hair back. It was a tiny ‘mom’ moment, but it hit me like a spell that was both warm and grounding.

“Promise me you’ll try to stay out of trouble?”

Mom had said the same thing right before I boarded my plane at LAX. Aunt Odette’s version felt more genuine somehow.

I nodded, throat still too tight to say anything else.

She grabbed her keys.

“Come on. Let’s get you to school.”

“Sure—but be real with me.” I got up slowly, not ready to let go of my opportunity yet. “Were there two other cases?”

Aunt Odette rolled her eyes.

“Five?”

“Seven?”

She ignored me all the way to the front door.

“Seriously—that many?”

My guesses would get much higher during the car ride. And just to shut me up, Aunt Odette admitted that there were four other cases of serial aggravated assault in the last three months. But here’s the clincher. At least two cases were linked to Brook-Sci.

“A student and a teacher during summer break,” I whispered to Dre, who’d stolen the seat in front of Bella.

It was an easy steal. Davey Schumer missed class. No doubt he was busy with his new role as part of the cool kids’ club. Or as Bruce called them, Courage’s acolytes.

Speaking of Courage’s acolytes, Margot was around. So were the pink dreadlocks girl and three others I’d seen hanging out at the basement with Felix. None of them recognized me or Dre, though. Proof that Bruce’s advice about masks might not have been a silly idea after all.

“That tracks,” Bella cut in. “Mr. Brooker’s supposed to be teaching World History.”

Yep, she was listening. Hard not to when she hadn’t left me or Dre alone since school started.

“Heard he’s on medical leave. Now we know why,” Dre weighed in. “And we get Sanchez as a permanent sub.”

We turned to the whiteboard, where Sanchez was busy flirting with the girls seated up front.

“What a creep,” Bella muttered.

I couldn’t disagree. I’d caught Sanchez trying to look down Bella’s shirt earlier. Dude was a real pervert.

“You think he knows about it?” Dre asked.

“Maybe,” I whispered. “With all the bad juju around here, someone on the faculty’s gotta be in on it.”

“In on what exactly?” Bella asked. “You two still won’t tell me…”

Dre and I traded looks. Then he turned around, leaving me to deal with her.

This morning, Bruce had encouraged caution, reminding me that Bella might not react to the Coliseum’s secret the way we did.

I sighed.

“Look, I get it. You’re trying to protect your brother…but it’s not safe to know what we know.”

“Wouldn’t it be less safe for me not to know about the bad things happening at the school I go to?”

“She has a point,” Dre said, still facing forward.

I sighed again.

Last night, Dre and I had cooked up a bunch of lies to satisfy Bella’s curiosity. Looking at her now, and seeing the sincerity on her face, I couldn’t say any of them.

“Let’s do a trade,” I said.

She eyed me skeptically, as if I was about to do a ‘Sanchez’ and get inappropriate.

“Dude, get your mind out of the gutter,” I said. “I’ll tell you what we know…if you tell me what Felix wants with you.”

“Why?”

“Because it might be connected.”

“Are you suggesting Felix had something to do with my brother’s beating?”

“Tell us what he wanted first.”

Bella made a face that was hard to read. Embarrassed maybe, or anxious?

“He asked me out,” she said, glancing away.

“That’s it?” I asked.

“Can’t be,” Dre said, turning back to us now that Bella didn’t look so annoyed. “You get hit on all the time. You look too uncomfortable for it to be just that.”

He wasn’t wrong. She looked sketchy. Kind of like I did with Aunt Odette earlier.

“He also invited me to join his social club.”

Dre’s eyes met mine.

“What was that look?” Bella demanded.

I hesitated.

“Did he tell you what kind of club it was?” I asked.

“No, he was being vague,” she admitted. “But he claimed it could help my career.”

“How?” Dre asked.

“Connections, I guess, but also…”

We leaned in.

“Also?” he prompted.

“He said his club could help me find the courage to climb greater heights…”

Dre and I exchanged another look.

“Courage,” he whispered.

“Definitely my new trigger word,” I whispered back.

“Why?” Bella asked.

Dre and I traded glances.

“Stop that,” she hissed.

That’s how our whispered conversation ended.

There was a loud ‘Whoosh!’ and I ducked out of instinct. A pen flew past my ear, clattering into the back wall.

Sanchez had finally noticed us, and just when things were getting interesting.

Still, promising Bella the truth got her to agree to our plan. She’ll talk to Felix at lunch. It meant we had some time to prepare in case things went sideways, and they usually did when the Coliseum was involved.

Since I needed to update my arsenal, I went looking for Yuna between classes, finding her near the second-floor lockers.

“Hey.” I pulled the gloves out of my backpack. “Think you can save these guys?”

She inspected them with a maker’s eye while I snuck glances at her face. Man, she was pretty.

“You’re better off buying new gloves,” Yuna said. “How’d you even melt my studs? Pick a fight with an incinerator?”

It wasn’t just the iron studs. Seams were ripped and padding was missing. Basically, my knockoff Jono Jones gloves were toast. Too bad, because I’d gotten attached to them.

“Can you make me new ones?” I asked.

“Sure, but the earliest I can get your order done is next Wednesday,” she said. “Dre’s commission comes first.”

Huh, great minds did think alike.

“He wants a new foil?”

Yuna nodded.

“Customized epee with a plated silver guard.”

“Because silver’s a purifying agent. Folk tales. I get it.”

“You’re both obsessed.” She eyed me curiously. “If I had to guess, it’d be vampires? Werewolves?”

“W-what?”

Yuna glanced around. When she was sure other kids weren’t listening in, she whispered, “I hear there are bad things roaming these halls…”

I chuckled nervously. “Seriously?”

I know, I know, I didn’t sound convincing at all. Couldn’t help it. She caught me off guard.

There was a loud ‘Bang!’ and I jumped. But no, it wasn’t a gladiator coming out to pick a fight. Just a kid slamming his locker shut.

Luckily, Yuna didn’t seem to mind that I was jumpy. Or maybe she just didn’t care. I’m not sure I preferred that.

“I’ll let you know when your order’s done,” she said. “You should find a temp for now.”

It was good advice, and Guillermo at Lost & Found was happy to accommodate.

“Dude, I got these babies,” he slid a pair of iron knuckles across the counter, “from a kid whose dad got it from a friend who bought it at an auction house run by this Civil War buff who got it from a historian dude who teaches History at NYU who swears these were used by Abraham Lincoln’s bodyguards.”

“Okay,” I nodded. “That’s um—wow—that’s astonishing.”

It really was.

I knew from paying attention in my old history class that soldiers in the Civil War carried cast-iron knuckles in battle. But if these were legit, they’d be rusted by now.

“Thanks, dude.”

I reached for the second knuckle, but Guillermo was quicker.

“Uh-uh-uh, my vertically gifted friend. What’ve you got to barter with?”

“How about this?”

I pulled another lion mask out of my bag. This one I got from the chair—ahem—the gladiator Bruce had been sitting on when we met. The Frenchie had known how to take them out without making the kid scream like a maniac, which basically made masks an item drop.

“Whoa.”

Guillermo reverently raised it to the light.

“This is freaking awesome.”

“Fair trade?”

“Fair trade,” Guillermo said, passing me the second knuckle. “Need anything else?”

“Actually…what do you know about folk remedies?” I asked.

“That depends,” he said, leaning over his counter. “How much time do you have?”

Not a lot, but this seemed important enough to be late for my next class.

Guillermo listed an entire menu of detoxifying herbs and fragrant flowers with connections to the occult, and I got him to look for rare ones like ghost pipe and horehound for our next barter.

Ten minutes later, I was rushing into 2-F for geometry.

Luckily, Ms. Duri Han was one of Brook-Sci’s nicer teachers. Late didn’t mean detention—not if I solved the question on the board. It asked me to measure the angle at each point of a regular pentagram.

A quick calculation gave me thirty-six degrees, which was obviously the right answer. Seriously, though, a pentagram, of all things. In this school?

What really got my stomach fluttering wasn’t the classmates trying to trip me—that was getting old. It was Dre’s news, which he was quick to spill as soon as I sat down.

See, while I was busy getting new gear, he had gone fishing.

“I talked to four guys on the list,” he said, brow furrowed. “They know about the Coliseum, Ollie. They’ve been betting on the fights.”

Well, shit.

I remembered overhearing kids talking about losing their allowance after Jack Dandy lost to Davey Schumer. That was the day paramedics carried Jack off on a stretcher.

“This might be more widespread than we thought,” I said.

I turned to the window. That’s when I noticed the empty seat next to mine. But we still had English and P.E. before lunch.

A creeping cold slid down my back.

“Dude, where’s Bella?”

From what I see around me, everyday costs have quietly crept up: rent, food delivery, coffee, subscriptions, transportation, even small “treat yourself” habits that have become normal parts of daily life. Salaries may have increased on paper, but it doesn’t always feel like they’ve kept pace with the way lifestyle costs have expanded.
On top of that, the way we consume has changed.
We’re constantly exposed to ads, flash sales, influencers, and buy-now-pay-later systems that make spending easier and more tempting than ever. It feels like the default culture today encourages spending first and saving later.
Ten years ago, people around me seemed to rely more on cash, had fewer monthly subscriptions, ate out less, and generally lived more simply. Saving felt more “natural” back then.

About 3 months ago I started working at a coffee shop… about a month into working there I started getting very bad bloating and a pain right behind my belly button. Like a stabbing pain. I went to all sorts of doctors and no one knew what was wrong. As a last ditch effort I went to an allergist. Lo and behold coffee comes back positive as a 6/30, and chocolate as a 7/20… two things I used to regularly use no problem. (There were others that popped up positive but those two were the only ones that stood out as “big” reactions.)

The doctor told me to take these test with a grain of salt because there can be a lot of false positives… well I did just that. Lived my life enjoying the same foods that I have been. I used the allergy test to quit the coffee job, but funny enough it did kind of help with the bloating. But i continued to drink coffee every now and then. 

Cut to Thanksgiving I decided to have a chocolate martini, that had a coffee liquor in it. I drank it… everything was fine. 4 or 5 hours later I broke out in hives on my arm, didn’t think much of it, just popped a Benadryl and went about. 2 minutes after the Benadryl I immediately felt dizzy, lost feeling in my face and arms. Never did it feel hard to breathe BUT it did feel like it was hard to get a full breath. It came in waves. After the second wave I called an ambulance, in the ambulance half way to the hospital they applied epi, as the EMT said my face went red and he thought I was going epileptic. 

At the hospital after this whole episode, doctor walks in and says “I think you had a panic attack.” At this point I’m so confused. I’ve never had a panic attack in my life. Eventually a new doctor came in and said he thinks I had an allergic reaction, but the confusing answers made it so much worse. Was it panic, or an actually reaction. 

Now I’m scared to eat almost anything. All I eat is apples, bananas, chicken, rice. Anything else does give me a panic attack. But I still haven’t had an episode like the one on Thanksgiving. Can I please have advice. I don’t know what to do or what to believe. I will answer any questions to help. Please. ",1,1766994446.0,Allergies,3,1.0,False
1pyg8bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1pyg8bm/i_quit_today/,I Quit Today,"Today was the absolute worst. The store was crowded today with long lines every half hour. A cashier didn't show up today and it was mainly me at the register alone. It was stressful as the touchscreen on my register stopped working and we ran out of the big bags. The managers as usual are always gone in the donation area (I work at a thrift store, or worked I mean) and I had to constantly called them up for price checks as well as approving returns as it requires their login. 

As I was working 6 and a half hours that day, I was supposed to have a fifteen minute break and a lunch break later. I made plans to go to a coffee place for lunch to treat myself. After a while after my break was supposed to happen, a coworker noticed and let me go on break as they stayed at the register. I took the break, finally rested and ate a little then went back to the regiesters. Then chaos came. 

Long crazy lines, even this one big family that was paying individually that drove me crazy. I was fustrated as all at the same time customers were asking questions, I had to bag many things in the little bags, customers paying with cash and expecting change instantly, etc. I had to call over and over for backup cashiers. The second the customers were gone, they left to the back again. 

Another coworker that was scheduled came the second half of my shift and I felt grateful. And of course, the manager asked them to go to the donation area to help out. I'm all exhausted and stressed to the point in getting teary eyed, and still no moment to breathe. The store continues on being busy then slow, and then my manager speaks to my coworker who barely came to help at the registers to go recover the floor. I made 3 cash drops and still the manager doesn't at least ask me if I want to recover for a moment!? 

This wasn't the first time this happened but today was horribly busy and it was all up to me to do everything. The manager asked me if I wanted to speak to the supervisor to sort things out instead of quitting and I said no. I had a good cry of fustration afterwards, drove to some stores before heading home. Honestly I'm relieved I did this as I can focus on college more when the new semester starts and focus on finding an internship related to my major",6,1766994266.0,retailhell,0,1.0,False

I was so happy to not have had a single weird medical episode while visiting family for the holidays (aside from some killer back/hip pain keeping me awake all last night 🫠 the arthritis has been a bitch lately).

 We go do some shopping today and stop at a coffee shop. I, being a responsible person, ask for decaf, because i dont wanna feel like shit and my caffeine tolerance is very low. Plus i had forgotten my water bottle and had been very very slowly drinking a bottle of soda (i opened it at 9am and it is still not gone) plus my stimulant, so i really did not need more caffeine. Mfers did NOT give me decaf. It is 2:30am and i am having heart palpitations, and when i really noticed i was having issues at about 8pm, my BP was through the roof and I was very lightheaded. Thankfully BP has come down just with water and laying down, but the palpitations persist, keeping me from sleeping for the second night in a row. 

Im so mad, things were going so well 😭 i was being so careful to not overload on caffeine and keep up my water intake, but of course the one day I forget to bring my water bottle is also the day I get caffeined.

Thought some may find this interesting also. 


The comment: 

“Please understand, when deception is being employed, details matter. The price of gold is NOT going up. It’s the value of the currency (US dollar) going down due to the currency being printed “without limit” out of thin air. This loss of value and purchasing power of the currency will be reflected in what appears to be rising gold and silver prices. Because it takes a lot more of the currency to buy the same amount of gold.
Most people are completely oblivious and don’t understand this. Plus, gold is NOT an investment. Gold is real money, real wealth. It’s can’t “crash” like the stock market or bitcoin. They (the currency creators) are desperately trying to get us (the users of the currency) to believe that gold and silver are mere commodities like sugar, lumber, and coffee. But they are not mere commodities.
And they want you to believe this so that you’ll continue to believe that paper currency is real money. It’s not real money, it is a money substitute, and it requires third-party validation. Take away the third party (in this case the USA) and the currency goes to zero. Not so with gold and silver. They require no third party, they stand on their own. Once you understand this then owning and holding your savings in gold and silver will begin to make sense.”",5,1766994167.0,Silverbugs,2,0.86,False

- He doesn’t take me back
- I break in to his house and show up unannounced to talk to him twice
- I get rejected and after that I try to leave him alone
- I fail and still continue to break no contact every month

3 months go by, I call him and ask to meet up. (Super surprised he picked up and agreed since I broke into his home twice and crossed major boundaries). We go for a quick bite and he doesn’t want o get back together and we stop talking. I start seeing someone.

3 more months go by with no contact on my end. He starts showing up around my school building and the comes up to me asking if I wanted to go for a coffee and catch up.

I say no because I just started seeing someone new.

But what??? This guy was saying no to me the entire time I was chasing and as soon as I start talking to someone new he senses it and suddenly feels ready to ask me out?

1pyg2ow,https://youtube.com/shorts/zrxeg7a3pSU?si=8t0rlQypz8CRlgCM,Aline lost 6-stone in 2025 by eating more Protein and Daily Walks 🏆 Slim...,"🏆 Slimmer of the Year 2026… Every personal trainer and health professional I’ve ever met had the same dream, they wish their nearest and dearest would follow their advice, especially many men in the fitness industry who are desperate to help their mums.  
On my holistic course they told us ‘anyone that has wiped your behind as a baby, will never listen to your advice’ and I soon came to the conclusion it’s true.  
Many psychologists agree the only way you can really change behaviors of someone close to you, is to lead by example in whatever you want them to do/change, and it has to be consistently. Plus being open minded it could take months, years or decades for it to happen (it’s a great test of real love!).  
Well I am very pleased to announce, this year's star slimmer is in fact… my mum, Aline Durkin!  
My mum has lost over 6 stone in the last few years.  
She lost a few stone after covid - and after her 70th birthday- when I had lost some weight when I really got back into exercising personally for myself, walking and cycling outdoors.  
Then last year my mum got cancer and had to have a kidney removed, this really inspired her to take care of herself more.  
She’s been a 24-hour carer for my step-dad - who had a stroke - for over 10 years now and knew she had to start looking after herself again.  
Also last year I conquered my nutrition thanks to protein shakes and I introduced my mum to the same positive communities that helped me.  
Thank you Matt, Saffron and the Angel team, who simply told her what I tell my clients everyday, but because it was from their mouths not mine, it was mentally easier to accept and act upon.  
She really found the key to the system - the daily routine - of weighing everyday, getting plenty of protein and liquids in first thing, life changing and the real route to her success long term!  
She’s like me, loves cakes, and you’ll be pleased to know she’s kept those in, a couple of times a week enjoying cakes and coffee outside the house with her sisters or my step dad Keith. She’s stuck to the 80/20 rule. 6 days a week (18 meals a week) she eats high protein meals, and the other 'treat day' (or 3 meals a week) she does what she likes, including fish and chips on a Friday from the chippy and a pizza with the grandkids once a week.  
She’s replaced her crisps for protein crisps, her low-fat and high sugar ‘skinny bars’ for filling protein bars, and started to love high protein meals such as natural whole yogurt with fresh berries sprinkled on top, jacket potato with whole cottage cheese and pineapple, fish sushi, smoked salmon and scrambled eggs, plus a hot baked camembert cheese with veggies dipped in it.  
And if you ask her how it’s been… “it was easy” she will tell you… “I just swapped a few things and made sure I did a little walk everyday.”  
The best news of all is as a diabetic type 2, she’s been able to ditch the metformin medication and now keeps her blood glucose balanced with diet and exercise alone.  
Congratulations Mum! So proud of you and well done for inspiring the rest of the family to work on their health and wellbeing. Love you lots x",1,1766993698.0,u_JodyBunting,0,1.0,False

Your Active Retirement starts now ✈️ (Seriously, bundling flights & hotels saved us a fortune!)","**You Might Be Richer Than You Think (But Are You Using Your Money Right?)**

Ever looked at your bank account and thought, *""If I just had a little more, I’d finally feel secure""*? Here’s the truth: **most of us are sitting on way more financial power than we realize**—we’re just not using it the right way.

### The Money Myth We All Fall For
We’ve been sold this idea that financial freedom is about *having more*. But what if the real secret is *doing more with what you already have*? Think about it:
- That $500 sitting in your savings account? It could be growing *way* faster.
- The spare change you ignore? It’s actually a stealthy wealth-builder.
- The ""I’ll start investing later"" mindset? It’s costing you *thousands* in missed opportunities.

### The Simple Shift That Changes Everything
You don’t need a windfall to build real wealth—you just need to **put your money to work**. Here’s how:
1. **Stop letting your savings sleep** – A high-yield account or smart investment can turn idle cash into a money-making machine. *(You might be richer than you think—find out how much your savings could really fund your retirement. [https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb](https://mavely.app.link/e/Jw8ypIghuYb))*
2. **Automate the boring stuff** – Set up auto-transfers to investments so you *never* forget to pay your future self.
3. **Spend like a strategist** – Cut one unnecessary expense (yes, even that daily coffee) and redirect it to something that grows.

### The Real Question
If you could **double the power of your current savings** without working harder, would you do it? The tools are out there—you just have to use them.

I parked in the Strip District at Kelly O's Diner around 2:30 PM to grab coffee and do some work and came back around 3:50 PM to find my car towed. I called the number on the sign and was told to pick it up in Coraopolis for $300. The owner texted the towing company at 3PM on a Sunday weekend of a Christams holiday to have my car towed (her business closed at 2pm).

At pickup, they refused to accept credit or debit card and insisted on Venmo or cash only. They had my car blocked by another vehicle, so I paid via Venmo to get it released. I then asked for an itemized receipt explaining the $300 charge.

Instead of a receipt, I received multiple hostile texts (insults, profanity), false accusations that I was drinking and driving, and a message saying they’d be “looking for my vehicle and license plate all through the city for the next couple months.” .

I’ve filed a complaint with the PA Attorney General, but I’m curious:

* Is Venmo/cash-only towing normal here?
* Is refusing an itemized receipt common or allowed?
* Have others had similar experiences?
* What should I do next? this is shady practice

Shaving Soap – Pearl CoffeeOp

Brush – Avino Synthetic

Razor – Pearl L55 Close Comb Antique Brass

Blade – Laser Ultra (2x)

After Shave – Alum, Shavologist Maris Skin Food

No pre-shave routine today, just scooped out 2 spoons of Pearl CoffeeOp, and lathered in the Yaqi Bowl with the new Avino Synthetic Brush. This brush is a value for money and an awsome knot paired with a perfect handle. Softness was very apt and the knot is not too dense. Generated volumunous lather for 3 passes. Last time I took about 3 spoons of this soap and it turned out to be too much, and even 2 scoops seem to be a lot for producing lather, may be I will just scoop out 1 scoop next time and add more if required. May be because I added a lot of hydration this time, the lather was very slick.

Picked up Pearl L55 Close Comb and paired with Laser Ultra on it’s second use. The first pass with the grain went very smooth. I usually go for just 2 passes, first pass wtg and then on second pass I go xtg on face and atg (south to north) on neck. But because I had too much lather and the razor blade combo was working well, I tried xtg on face and then xtg on neck as well. Somehow I need to develop my muscle memory for the xtg on neck area. Just 3-4 weepers on neck after the second pass. I still had enough lather for the 3^(rd) pass, went atg on face for the first time and then atg on neck. I can now say what BBS is, earlier it was all near BBS. I might not do it regularly, but definitly worth it, when planets are aligned in your favour.

Good alum feedback on neck and minor feedback on face as well. 3 passes do require utmost post shave care so picked up Shavologist Maris Skin Food and I could recall the smoothness after my very first shave which was with Sensor Excel.",5,1766993466.0,Wetshavers_India,4,1.0,False

SFX: A remote forest cabin. Wind in the pines, birds chirping, very distant traffic sounds.

SFX: a truck pulls up in a spray of gravel. The engine cuts a door opens and shut.

(angry) **Hey! Hey there! Anybody home?**

**...**

(angrier) **I was asking to be polite, I know you're in there. Better come out and let's get this over with.**

Sfx; cabin door lock clicks shut

**...**

**Are you serious? Did you just lock the door?**

SFX: footsteps on the porch. An officious KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK on the door.

**...**

**Hey! This is Ash Bennett. Of the Bennett Pack. And you appear to be a lone wolf establishing yourself in our territory. Stand and declare yourself.**

**...**

**You aren’t establishing yourself? You’re buying real estate! Mrs Grunderson down at the bank says you paid cash for this place. Paid way too much, by the way. Silas has been trying to offload this termite shack to some city sucker for years. What are you trying to do, start a one wolf gentrification movement? You got any avocado toast or cold brew coffee in there? You better declare it now.**

**...**

**Well, I don’t want any trouble either. I want to know what the hell you’re doing in our neck of the woods without so much as a courtesy heads up!**

**...**

**You didn’t know you were supposed to do that? Ugh. City wolves.** (growing growl) **Well, we’re doing this now.** 

(a full threatening snarl) **Come out. Now. Or I’m coming in!**

SFX: door lock clicks. Front door opens.

(snarling)  **It’s about time. Now, what do you think you’re  -** 

(speaker stops, takes a sudden, surprised SNIFF) 

(a sharp change from angry to concerned) **Hold up. Hey. Hey, City Wolf. Breath, all right? I’m not here to hurt you. Geez, sit down before you pass out. All right?** 

**...**

**I’m going to back up. See? Backing up to your driveway, and I’m going to sit down too. See? I’m sitting. Criss cross apple sauce. Over here. You’re safe.** 

**...**

**You’re not afraid? To be frank, City, they can probably smell that panic attack from the highway. Sit down there on the steps. Put your head down between your knees.**

**...**

**Yeah, okay. That’s right, deep breaths. I’m not going to hurt you.**

**...**

(Does not believe listener can handle themselves:) **No, no, I’m sure you can handle yourself.**

**...**

(Does believe listener didn’t mean to offend:) **Yeah. I know you didn’t mean any offense. None’s taken, okay? I just, wow...** (embarassed) **It really wasn’t my intention to welcome you to town by scarin’ you right into a flop sweat.**

**...**

**Of course it is, it’s just - !** (heavy sigh). **Look. I’m sorry. I came on too strong, all right? The whole town’s in a tizzy with a new wolf spreading their scent around, at the bank, the grocery store, the gas station. And I assumed you were being rude on purpose. Or at least careless. Just like a City Wolf, to come in here and play loner in the wilderness, like these woods aren’t already somebody else’s home.**

**But that isn’t what’s going on here, is it?**

**Guess I forget sometimes this is a small town. People round here know each other. They know what’s expected, what’s good manners. They know to expect me when they step out of line. But if you don’t know what’s expected, if you don’t know me,** (rueful, acknowledging the mistake:) **then I’m just some angry asshole, yelling and pounding on your door, while you’re out in the middle of the woods. Alone.**

**Can we, uh, pretend the last five minutes didn’t happen and start this conversation over, with me introducing myself like a normal-ass alpha should’ve to a visiting wolf?**

**...**

**Thank you.**

**Hello there. I’m Ash Bennett. And I guess you might say I’m in charge of the mangy mutts around these parts.**

**...**

**That’s right. I’m the alpha of the Bennett pack. May I get your name?**

**...**

**Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.**

**...**

(surprised) **Yeah, that’s right. I am a descendent of the first founder. Tenth generation of my family to carry the wolf blessing, sixth to lead the pack here in Vesper Falls as our permanent home. Bennett Pack is one of the oldest landlocked packs in this part of the world. How did you know that...?**

**...**

**Research? I... wasn’t aware we were listed somewhere as a werewolf friendly town. Where did you find that? Some blog? Best small town getaways for the busy City Wolf?**

**...**

**Huh. Newspaper clippings and microfiche. That’s old school. Are you... some kind of librarian then?...** 

**...**

(ears pricking) **High school science teacher? Accredited?**

**...**

**Not here on vacation? So you, uh, bought this place to relocate? And was that biology, chemistry, physics, maybe all three? ... No. No. That’s not what I came here to ask. What are you doing here?**

**...**

**Not my business? That’s where you’re wrong, City. You may not be in my pack, but you’re a wolf in my territory and that does make it my business.**

**...**

**I don’t want you to leave, I want you to explain it to me. Beside, there’s no way Silas is gonna buy this place back from you. You are truly stuck with it.**

**...**

**Just want to be alone? Oh, that’s, heh, that’s not gonna work. You can be alone in the city, but you can’t be alone in a small town.** 

**Explain it to me. Why do you want to be alone?**

**...**

**“So you won’t hurt anyone?” You mean, so the wolf won’t hurt anyone? City,** ***have*** **you hurt anyone?**

**...**

**Yeah, I didn’t think so.** (gently) **How long ago were you turned?**

**...**

**I’m sorry, City, but... yeah. It’s pretty obvious. Even a city pack wolf understands the protocols. How a wolf moves into a new territory. How one wolf addresses another. What a wolf gives away in body language and scent. Even a city pack wolf would know all that, unless... you were not actually raised in a city pack. You're recently turned. And not willingly, am I right?**

**...**

**Three months? Geez. And... how?**

(Speaker growls)

...

**No, City. I’m angry, but not angry at you. But you know that, don’t you? You can’t explain it, but you know it at some visceral, feral level, what I’m saying to you.** 

**...**

**Eh. That is hard to put it in people words. But I'll try. I guess, it's an offer:** ***Allies against common enemy.*** 

***...***

**Yeah, common enemy. The wolf who attacked you, turned you. They still a problem?**

**...**

**Good. I’ll say that for city packs, they may not hold their bonds tight, but they do take care of their shit.** 

**Why didn’t you stay with a city pack? I mean, I’m not gonna lie, I think you did right getting out of that festering hive where there’s no room to breath. But... why leave? The city pack would've taken you on; you must have had connections, a job -**

**...**

**They** ***fired*** **you? For being a wolf? That’s not legal. The Employees with Magical Conditions Act...**

**...**

**Oh, wow. Wow. Well. Fuck the PTA.**  

**You... want to talk about it?**

**...**

**I don't know. The PTA. The attack. The city pack, the pamphlet - do they still do the pamphlets? ... It's crazy, right? That's what a new wolf needs after surviving a near death experience and waking up magical. Paperwork.**

**But, uh. Yeah. It's a lot. And I guess since you own property in my territory that makes you my, uh...**

**...**

**I was not going to say problem! My responsibility.** 

**Listen. I want you to come to our next pre-moon gathering. Gonna to be this Thursday.** 

**...**

**It’s not a party. It’s a logistics meeting. We get together a few nights before the change; the pack and the non-wolf local authorities. We go over the map, talk through any local events, regular occurrences. Then when the moon takes us, the pack sticks to our part of the map, the humans stick to theirs. No surprises, no panic, no unfortunate incidents.** 

**If you’re intending to shift in our neck of the woods next week, you should be there. Know what the plan is.**

**...**

**No, you can just be a tourist. For now. But your research wasn’t wrong. This is a damn good place to be a wolf. A lot of us work the deeper areas of the park as maintenance, fire and rescue, gamekeepers. But plenty of the pack have jobs or businesses here in town, living side by side with our human neighbors. And we could really use an accredited high school teacher.**

**...**

(sympathetic) **... no. No, you’re not on the human side of that equation. Not anymore. Doesn’t mean you aren’t still a person, City. And there’s kids here, wolf and human, who need somebody to explain the periodic table and the five laws of thermodynamics.**

**...**

**Right, three laws. Three laws of thermodynamics. You see? We need somebody, like, yesterday. Besides, you do already own the cabin.** (under speaker's breath) **Termites and all.**

**...**

SFX: gravel shifts as speaker stands. Car door opens.

**Seven pm next Thursday. Community Center, the Maple Room. Be there. You might see something worth sticking around for.** 

SFX: the truck engine rumbles to start.

**Hope to see you round, City!**

This article is divided into subsections and hence you can directly jump over to whichever information you are looking for. The goal of this article is to provide you with enough information so that you can undertake this trek independently or if you are looking to have more details of the trek for your planning. Thank you for taking your time to go through the information and happy hiking.

**Introduction**

Annapurna Base Camp trek you to the heart of Annapurna Himalayas where you would have magnificient views of the Annapurna ranges and the majestic Fishtail (Macchapuchre) mountain. Nowadays, the trek can be easily completed in 6 Days starting from Pokhara and ending at Pokhara. It is a perfect beginner friendly trek and since the highest elevation is at 4200 metres, there are minor risks of High Altitude Sickness. However, I have observed no of people getting down with Altitude Sickness if they try to push themselves too hard or ascent too fast due to time constraints or personal reasons. It is a perfect starter to the multi day hiking adventure in the Himalayas. The teahouses are well equipped and you can expect creature comforts of hot showers, internet service, electricity, freshly brewed coffee, etc in this trek. By this account, it is still a challenging hike if you don't have a lot of experience hiking and somedays can be pretty demanding. Let's dwelve into the details of the hike starting with:

**Transportation**  
Our journey generally starts from Pokhara. One can hire a private jeep from Pokhara to get to Jhinu which is the last vehicle point of the trek. The cost of single jeep hire ranges from 50-60 USD and hence, if you are in a group of 2-4, this is an ideal way of getting to the trail head. Alternatively, you can also get a shared jeep from Harichowk of Pokhara or Baglung Bus Park, where you can expect to pay about 10-15 USD per person. Mind you, some shared jeeps/buses doesn't go exactly upto Jhinu and diverts mid way to go towards Ghandruk, so you have to essentially get off at the junction and hike for about an hour to get to Jhinu.

**Permits**  
If you are trekking independently, you can acquire FIT Permits from the Nepal Tourism Board Office at [Kathmandu ](https://g.co/kgs/J2nw2PQ)or [Pokhara](https://g.co/kgs/L31LPmz). You have to be present in person, fill up a form with your details, mention Nayapool as an Entry and End Point of the trek, submit the form along with the photocopy of your passport, 2 p.p. size photographs and NRs. 3000. The staffs at NTB would process your forms and hand you the ACAP Permits within 10-15mins. This Permit is all you need to traverse around the majestic Annapurna region and works as a single entry permit. You will be required to submit this permit at the checkpost at Birethanti (after Nayapul) and/or at Chomrong. You will also be required to present the permit during the exit and hence I suggest you to hold onto them till you are back at Pokhara. Alternatively, you can also acquire permits online via [epermit.ntnc.org.np](http://epermit.ntnc.org.np) The process is fairly straightforward, as you fill the form, upload a simple headshot of yours for the photograph, check out with your Credit Card and download/print the permits once its done. 

**Teahouses and Amenities**  
Annapurna Base Camp trek is laiden with decent teahouses with the creature comforts mentioned above. The food choices are abundant and unless you are going there in high season or peak tourist season, you don't have to worry about not finding Accommodations. Having said that, I have seen quite a no of independent trekkers who arrived in peak season and had to settle for Dining Halls due to lack of rooms. Also, unlike other trekking destinations, the teahouses in ABC route doesn't have firewood heater to keep the rooms warm. Hence, depending on the times of the year, it is advised to carry warm clothes to wear after your arrival at the teahouses.

All the teahouses have hot shower facilities and some even have laundry services. You can expect to pay about NRs. 200 for the Hot Gas Shower and as for the 6-7 days of trek, there would be minimal requirement of laundry services. However, you can avail laundry services at Chomrong, Dovan, Deurali, etc. 

**Hydration/Food**  
One of the most blaring questions is of hydration. There are no provisions of bottled water beyond Chomrong and hence, I suggest you to bring a Nalgene Bottle and use Steripen or Water Purification Tablets that you can purchase at Thamel. Alternatively, you can also buy Filtered/Boiled water from the teahouses. However, given your requirement of 3-4 litres daily and the cost of NRs. 150 per litre to NRs. 200 per litre, it can add up quite fast. Hence, I suggest you to bring your own water filtration such as Steripen, Sawyer Filter or Water Purification Tablets.

The food situation is quite good on the trails as there will be plenty of options. I haven't encountered anyone with cases of food poisoning so far. The meat products are not available beyond the place called 'Bamboo' for logistical and largely religious reasons. However, I would suggest you refraining from meat products when you are hiking altogether just to be on the safe side. You can always have your own sources of protien i.e. protein bars, snacks, protien powder, etc. 

**Connectivity and Electricity**  
Annapurna Base Camp is well connected with Internet Access all the way to the basecamp. The cellphone connectivity is until Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC) with 4G Connectivity. The internet comes from Fibre Optic connectivity. However, they would ask for additional NRs. 150 - NRs. 200 to use the Internet services, should you require once you reach higher elevations.

Each of the teahouses/camps have their own micro hydropower plant and hence, unless you are staying at the Annapurna Base Camp (ABC) or Machapuchre Base Camp (MBC), these two are the only places without electricity and rely on Solar Power.

**Itinerary and Add Ons**  
This is a rough guide to how I plan my treks to Annapurna Base Camp generally.

* Day 1 - Pokhara to Jhinu (By Jeep) and Hike to Chomrong
* Day 2 - Chomrong to Dovan
* Day 3 - Dovan to Deurali
* Day 4 - Deurali to Annapurna Base Camp
* Day 5 - Annapurna Base Camp to Bamboo
* Day 6 - Bamboo to Jhinu and Jeep back to Pokhara

Day 1 - We would start after our breakfast (8-9am) and get on the jeep heading towards Jhinu. The journey would take about 3 hours and we would show our permits at the checkpost in Birethanti. As we reach Jhinu, we would prepare ourselves for the hike, cross a long suspension bridge and begin a rather steep ascent to Chomrong. This would take another 2-3 hours in an average pace and can be completed under 2 hours for a moderately paced hiker. Since we would still be in lower elevations, the conditions are quite hot and humid during the hike, followed up by the chill/cold evening at Chomrong.

Day 2 - We start fairly early from **Chomrong**, depending on the time of the year between 7 am to am. We do so to avoid the ascend of **Upper Sinuwa** in the blaring afternoon sun. There is another checkposts at Chomrong where we enter our permits and off we go downhill for about an hour to be greeted with a suspension bridge. As we cross the beautiful suspension bridge, our steep ascent to **Upper Sinuwa** begins. It might take about 2 hours to reach Upper Sinuwa where we generally take a longer 15-20mins break, have some tea admiring the views. The trail becomes more easier and flatter after Upper Sinuwa and after another hike and a descent we reach **Bamboo**, where we will have our lunch. Generally, we aim to have our lunch between 12-1 pm for an early morning start of 7 am. After our lunch, the trail goes through a slight ascent finally we reach **Dovan** after about 1-1.5 hour of hike after Bamboo.

Day 3 - From **Dovan** to **Himalaya**, it is a pretty accessible trail until we reach a beautiful waterfall after the hike for about 1-1.5 hour. It is also home to 'Barahi Temple', which is a diety for local and natives of the region. From the waterfall, our ascent begins for another 1-1.5 hour till we reach the place called Himalaya. This is our lunch place for the day and please don't forget to have some Pizza on this place for which it is quite known for. After lunch, we begin a gradual ascent to Hinku Caves for about 2 hours and another 40 mins of hiking would bring us to **Deurali.**

Day 4 - Another early start to the day, the trails are failry accessible with moderate ascent until we reach **Machapuchre Base Camp(MBC)**. The valley opens up and you would be greeted with the awe-inspiring views of the entire Annapurna Himalayas. It takes about 2-3 hours for modertalely paced hikers to reach MBC where we would take a small tea break. Then another 2-3 hours of uphill ascent would bring us to the fabled **Annapurna Base Camp (ABC)**. Today we will have our lunch at Annapurna Base Camp spend time inside the teahouse awaiting the beautiful sunset at ABC. We wil have an early dinner likely 6-7pm and fall asleep to wake up early for one of the most wonderful sunrise at about 5:30am depending upon the time of the year.

Day 5 - After we soak in the scenery, we will have a rather early breakfast in about 6:30-7am and start our preparations to go back down. We bid farewell to the ABC and begin our rather long day to get back down all the way to **Bamboo**. On a good pace, we would have our lunch at Himalaya and reach Bamboo by 2-3 pm. However, for average pace, it might take 1-2 hours longer. I have had clients where they were exceptionally fast paced and we managed to get back down all the way to **Lower Sinuwa or Chomrong** at some instances. But, for regular hikers, this is a perfect place to call it a night and take on the journey next day.

Day 6 - As we begin our journey back to **Jhinu**, we would have our lunch at **Chomrong**. Today would also be a rather long day and suggest you to start early. It takes about 1.5 hour from Bamboo to Upper Sinuwa and another 2-3 hours from Upper Sinuwa to Chomrong. We will stamp our permits again at Chomrong. After lunch, we descend to Jhinu (1.5 hours) and get on the jeep to head over to Pokhara, again exiting the ACAP Checkpost at Birethati on the way.

This is the overall summary of the 6 days itinerary. Now, as far as the concerns for **Altitude Sickness** goes, you would have to be vigilant from **Deurali (3300metres).** Some decide to stay at **MBC (3700m)** and decide to take a early morning hike to **ABC (2hours).** However, I prefer to head over to ABC and fortunately, all of my clients have been fine and/or only presented mild symptoms of Altitude Sickness like Headache. However, pertaining to your conditions, you can make your own judgement on what fits you the best.

**Add Ons**  
Now onto the add ons for this itinerary, you can also continue to head towards Annapurna Sanctuary trek after returning back to Chomrong. Instead of continuing onto Jhinu, you can have an itinerary like this:

Day 6 - Bamboo to Chomrong  
Day 7 - Chomrong to Tadhapani  
Day 8 - Tadhapani to Ghorepani  
Day 9 - Early Morning hike to Poonhill (1.5 hours, back to Ghorepani (45mins) and hike to Banthati(3 hours) and Jeep to Pokhara (3 hours)

OR

Day 9 - Hike to Poonhill - Back to Ghorepani (Breakfast) and Hike to Tatopani (Shikha)  
Day 10 - Tatopani to Pokhara (By Bus or Jeep) - 4 hours

In my opinion, if you have the time I suggest you to hike down to Tatopani from Ghorepani. Technically, you will come across a small town called Pokharebagar from which you can take a taxi (NRs. 500) to Tatopani. It is famous for its natural hot springs and actually a perfect way to end your trek. However, if you dont have the time or doesn's suit you on the budget, you can end your hike at Day 9 and take the jeep back to Pokhara from Birethanti.

Please bear in mind that the jeep access to Birethanti or Jhinu might be blocked in monsoon seasons or periods of heavy rainfall and hence plan accordingly.

**Cost**  
The age old important question of how much this might cost you to do this trek. Apart from the obvious cost of permits, transportations, etc you can expect to spend about 30-50USD per day for your Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner and Accommodation along with some extras such as Hot Shower, Phone Charge or Internet services. There are trekkers who have done this trek in really small budget as well but it all depends on your dietary habits and preferenes.

Along with that, you can expect to pay about **30-50 USD** for an experienced trekking guide depending on his/her experience, qualifications, communication skills, group size, etc and about **15-20 USD per day for the Trek Assist (Porter Services).**

**Conclusion**  
Hopefully, this article was meaningful to assist you for the wonderful Annapurna Base Camp trek and left you with enough information to do it independently if you deem so. I haven't gone into full details of the landscape and the views as I would like you guys to be mesmerized upon your encounter to the beautiful himalayas. Annapurna Base Camp is definitely one of the 'The' treks that you should do if you are considering your hiking holiday to Nepal.",1,1766992559.0,hiking_Nepal,0,1.0,False
1pyfqo3,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1pyfqo3/ive_fallen_into_limerence_with_someone_i/,I've fallen into limerence with someone I reconnected with after 15 years. Not really sure how to deal with it.,"Some context for everyone. I (33 M) recently traveled to my home country for a vacation. I posted a story on instagram of my planned trip and a person I went to school with (33 F) but hadn't interacted with at all in 15 years reached out and told me she moved to the village I planned on visiting. So we made a plan to meet up for coffee.

What was supposed to only be a coffee catch up led to us hiring a 2-man kayak to go along the river. This then further led to us spending some time on the beach to watch the sunset. While no intimacy happened, and in hind sight I think I entirely missed the cue from her end lol, spending this whole day with her sparked something in me.

We met up again two days later for lunch and had a very good conversation. The time just flowed really quickly.

Unfortunately I had to leave town and the country to get back to work so couldn't spend more time with her. Ever since I have been thinking about her constantly non-stop. All I want to do is be speaking to her and be with her. 

In the two weeks after I last saw her, I was posting stories and she was interacting with them constantly, even asked about some of the stuff I posted. I asked her if she'd like a video call and she accepted. She did tell me that she doesn't usually do video calls so I felt like this was a sign that I could tell her that I liked her. Towards the end of the call, I did end up telling her I like her but her response was not what I had hoped for. Unfortunately she is just not emotionally available to me in that way despite us vibing so well on reconnection. It doesn't help either that I'm quite literally 9000km away from her and this was always going to be disastrous to begin with. Anyway after revealing to her that I liked her and would like to explore this even in a very light way, she pulled back quite hard. No more interactions with my stories, she wasn't even responding to some comments I made on her stories either. The only interaction since then was wishing each other a merry xmas and a few back and forths about some cookies she baked and posted which was yesterday.

But now I find myself in a situation where all I can do is think about her, fantasize about futures with her. Hell I have even considered quitting my job as soon as I've reached my financial goals later this year just to move to her village so that I can try salvage _something_ with her. It's been giving me great anxiety, I've been stalking her instagram page constantly to see what she's up to. I've been craving **any** kind of interaction from her, even if she just likes my story I post. I made a video I didn't post talking about the heart break I'm feeling without directly mentioning her, just a video about my experience.

This whole thing is really hard on me. I skipped work last Friday because upon waking up I had the worst anxiety from opening instagram and seeing her live her best life while I'm in this other country without any friends or social life. I just really miss the connection we instantly had after reconnecting and it sucks hard that she doesn't feel the same way. 

But yet here I am going up and down with my emotions, idealizing a future with her that will most likely never happen and it just never ends. It is physically painful and emotionally debilitating to the point that I even struggle to get myself out of bed on the bad days. 

What I initially thought was just a crush, I've had many, has honestly led to this uncontrolled obsession which is affecting me in my daily life. I just don't know what to do.",2,1766992533.0,limerence,1,1.0,False

Hyatt Place Denver Airport - I think I’d choose the House instead

Hyatt Centric Downtown Denver - Do not stay here if you want to sleep at all

Hyatt Place STL/Chesterfield - Good shades, stays dark

Hyatt Regency Jacksonville Riverfront - This place forgets to charge me 50% of the time lol

Hyatt Place Orlando / I-Drive - AC was broke, trash sleep

Andaz Miami Beach - Cool hotel, AC was broke tho

Hyatt Regency San Francisco - Sweet view, ideal location

Hyatt Vacation Club Carmel - Too dated, sleeper town. No AC so the fog made the room a sauna. Wasn’t our vibe

Dawn Ranch - The restaurant here is really really good. Incredible meal. The bartender can’t make drinks tho. No problems at hotel but the town (Guerneville) itself is a little odd. If going for the redwoods, go to the real redwoods forest instead. Will run out of things to do here and the local grocery store food is just not good at all. It’s like not a thing in the town progressed past 1970, I don’t know how to explain it. gives u the heebeegeebeez

Dream Hollywood - There is a club on the roof that bumps music late, was not aware of this. Surprisingly still better sleep than the Denver centric

Hyatt Centric Delfina Santa Monica - Slippery as fuck shower

Hyatt Regency Atlanta - Definitely the best one around downtown, would stay here over airport ones too

Hyatt Regency Aurora Conference - Don’t remember, probably alright

Hyatt Regency STL - Room stays dark, pleasant experience

Hyatt Regency Savannah - Not a lot of parking but the spaces next to it didn’t tow. Good room

Hyatt Regency Miami - Cool view, convenient location

Hyatt Place Jacksonville Airport - Don’t remember

Hyatt Place Pena Station - Good sleep

EPISODE DAAN - The gh was full so tried here, they’ve got a Texas Roadhouse as the breakfast. Kindve a trip all the way in Taiwan. Great rooms though, didn’t have any issues

Hyatt House Vanderbilt - I never like the parking garage attached places when u gotta carry ur stuff in down to lobby but really nice rooms I slept great here. Remembered this one

Hyatt House Lakewood at Belmar - Walking from the parking into the front desk is cold as shit bc the back door u need a key card for. I sleep good here tho

Hyatt Regency SLC - This place is a maze lowkey, parking is far also

Grand Hyatt Fukuoka - Cool hotel, I like southern Japan a lot

El Silencio Lodge & Spa - Costa Rica gem, wanted to tuck and leave it off. Blows Nayara out of the water. I spent a pretty penny at Nayara and they laughed at me during checkout when I told them they should actually put liquor in the drinks. I’m not sure if it was our age (we are 24) and a liability thing, who knows. Food was mids too. I’ve experienced similar at all inclusive places in central america/Caribbean and now refuse to stay at them. El Silencio is one of my favorite stays all time though, the food is amazing, service, things to do, lack of other people there. Everything is just top notch

# Chapter 1: The Call

I had been living as someone that was unneeded and unwanted for years because of my chubby figure, but the marriage with my billionaire husband and my adorable daughter tricked me into feeling like I was worth something, even though I was the wife that was hidden away. But the truth is, when I was kidnapped, my husband left me to die, burning in the fire.

 

When I survived and came back as a beautiful, charming woman, he looked at me with full desire.

 

*Please don’t marry him, I am better than him.*

 

He begged for me when I married another man, but it was ridiculous that he didn’t even know who I truly was.

 

This time, it was my turn to play the game.

 

**Chapter 1: The Call**

 

***Rachel’s POV***

 

The smell of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air when my phone buzzed against the counter. I wiped my hands on my apron before picking it up, half expecting it to be Amber’s teacher again about another art project.

 

But when I saw the name on the screen, my stomach fluttered.

 

Adrian.

 

My husband. The man who almost never called.

 

In the five years we had been married, I could count our phone calls on one hand, each one short, polite, and painfully formal. He was the CEO of The Grand Regal Hotel, a man made of schedules and control, not spontaneity. If he was calling now, something was wrong.

 

“Adrian?” I answered, trying to sound calm. “What happened?”

 

“The pastry chef cut his hand,” he said without preamble. His voice was crisp and efficient, the tone he used when delegating work, not speaking to his wife. “We need someone to finish the custom cake for tonight’s movie party.”

 

I blinked. “You mean—?”

 

“I need you to handle it.”

 

For a moment the world stilled. It had been years since I had stepped foot in that kitchen, his kitchen now, but something inside me lifted. The thought of returning to the place where I once poured my heart into flour and sugar filled me with a strange, bittersweet excitement.

 

“I’ll be there right away,” I said quickly.

 

“Don’t mention we’re married,” he interrupted, and my brief warmth froze. “You’re just a former employee helping out.”

 

There it was, the reminder. The invisible line drawn between us. I wasn’t his wife in the public eye, not even a rumor. Our marriage was a contract between two families, signed out of obligation, buried in secrecy.

 

“I know,” I murmured.

 

“Good.” He hung up.

 

No goodbye. No pause. Just silence.

 

I stood there for a moment, my fingers tightening around the phone until my knuckles went white. The air felt thick, heavy with things I never said aloud.

 

No, he was gentle sometimes, but his gentleness was reserved for *that woman.*

 

Just thinking of her filled my heart with bitterness. 

 

Shaking myself out of it, I changed quickly. I slipped into a dark tracksuit, something loose and comfortable. I had put on weight over the years. Every extra curve felt like a reminder of everything I had lost, control, confidence, maybe even him.

 

Still, work was work. I tied my hair back, took one last look in the mirror, and whispered to my reflection, “Just focus on the cake.”

 

By the time I reached The Grand Regal Hotel, my pulse had steadied. The building loomed ahead, sleek glass and marble reflecting the city’s skyline. I had helped build its reputation back when I was head pastry chef, back when my name meant something here.

 

The familiar scent of roasted coffee and vanilla greeted me the moment I stepped inside. My heels clicked softly across the polished floor as I passed old colleagues. Some smiled in surprise; others barely recognized me.

 

And then I saw him.

 

Adrian stood by the kitchen pass, giving orders to the staff. His silver-gray suit fit him perfectly, the crisp line of his shoulders sharp against the soft lighting. His dark blonde hair was combed back neatly, not a single strand out of place. When he turned and saw me, his expression didn’t change.

 

“You’re here,” he said simply, voice even, eyes unreadable. “The cake needs finishing. You have an hour and a half.”

 

“Yes, Mr Parker,” I replied automatically, the words tasting bitter.

 

His gaze lingered for a heartbeat, assessing, distant, all business. Then he turned on his heel and walked away, leaving behind the faint scent of his cologne, cedarwood and distance.

 

When he was gone, the kitchen relaxed.

 

“Rachel! You actually came!” my old sous-chef Greg exclaimed. “We thought tonight was doomed.”

 

“Nice to see you too,” I said, managing a small smile.

 

I slipped into a uniform and moved to the workstation. The half-finished cake sat before me, elegant layers of sponge and cream, delicate sugar roses waiting to bloom.

 

For the next hour, I lost myself in the rhythm of it. My hands moved automatically, smoothing, piping, sculpting, each motion muscle memory. The noise of the kitchen faded until it was just me, sugar, and silence.

 

When the last petal fell into place, Greg let out a low whistle. “You’ve still got it.”

 

Adrian came back just as I was setting down the piping bag. He examined the cake in silence, his eyes scanning every detail. After what felt like forever, he nodded once.

 

“Well done,” he said.

 

Two simple words, but my heart surged. At home he rarely noticed the small things. But here, as his employee, my work still meant something.

 

I forced a steady smile. “Thank you, sir.”

 

He turned away. “Help me move it to the banquet hall.”

 

We pushed the cake cart together through the gilded corridors. The hum of conversation grew louder as we neared the lobby. The film company’s party was already in full swing, laughter, glasses clinking, the faint sound of jazz echoing through marble halls.

 

I tried to keep my head down. My palms were sweaty against the handle of the cart. Then I heard Adrian’s breath catch. His attention fixed ahead, and when I followed his gaze, my stomach dropped.

 

A woman in a crimson silk dress stood by the bar, her golden curls catching the light. Even from across the room, I recognized her instantly.

 

*Marissa.*

 

She was arguing with a man whose hand rested far too low on her back. Before I could blink, Adrian was gone, striding across the floor like a storm.

 

“Let her go!” His voice boomed over the music.

 

The man stumbled back, startled. Adrian caught Marissa’s wrist and pulled her close, shielding her as though she were something fragile.

 

And that was when his shoulder hit the cake cart.

 

Time slowed. The three-tiered cake tilted forward in dreadful slow motion. I lunged, trying to steady it, but the weight overpowered me. The whole thing crashed onto the marble floor, icing, fruit, cream, everything exploding like a grotesque snowstorm.

 

The cart tipped, and I stumbled with it, landing face-first in what used to be a masterpiece.

 

For a second, there was only silence. Then laughter rippled through the crowd. Someone gasped. Someone else raised their phone.

 

I could feel frosting dripping from my hair down to my chin. My hands trembled.

 

Adrian finally turned, and the look in his eyes wasn’t concern. It was disgust.

 

I waited for him to come help me, to say something, anything.

 

But instead, he tightened his grip around Marissa’s shoulders, whispered something to her, and walked away.

 

He didn’t even look back.

 

I stood there, sticky and humiliated under the chandelier’s glow, surrounded by laughter and pity.

 

In that moment the truth was clear, painfully, irreversibly clear. Whenever Marissa needs Adrian, he will always pick her.

 

Not me.

 

I swallowed the lump in my throat and whispered to myself, so quietly no one could hear,

 

“Give up, Rachel. Just give up.” 

 

Yet even as the words left my lips, I still can escape that stubborn, hopeless longing which wells up every time I see his back.

 

*Adrian… please don’t go.*",1,1766991973.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

Adrian came back just as I was setting down the piping bag. He examined the cake in silence, his eyes scanning every detail. After what felt like forever, he nodded once.

 

“Well done,” he said.

 

Two simple words, but my heart surged. At home he rarely noticed the small things. But here, as his employee, my work still meant something.

 

I forced a steady smile. “Thank you, sir.”

 

He turned away. “Help me move it to the banquet hall.”

 

We pushed the cake cart together through the gilded corridors. The hum of conversation grew louder as we neared the lobby. The film company’s party was already in full swing, laughter, glasses clinking, the faint sound of jazz echoing through marble halls.

 

I tried to keep my head down. My palms were sweaty against the handle of the cart. Then I heard Adrian’s breath catch. His attention fixed ahead, and when I followed his gaze, my stomach dropped.

 

A woman in a crimson silk dress stood by the bar, her golden curls catching the light. Even from across the room, I recognized her instantly.

 

*Marissa.*

 

She was arguing with a man whose hand rested far too low on her back. Before I could blink, Adrian was gone, striding across the floor like a storm.

 

“Let her go!” His voice boomed over the music.

 

The man stumbled back, startled. Adrian caught Marissa’s wrist and pulled her close, shielding her as though she were something fragile.

 

And that was when his shoulder hit the cake cart.

 

Time slowed. The three-tiered cake tilted forward in dreadful slow motion. I lunged, trying to steady it, but the weight overpowered me. The whole thing crashed onto the marble floor, icing, fruit, cream, everything exploding like a grotesque snowstorm.

 

The cart tipped, and I stumbled with it, landing face-first in what used to be a masterpiece.

 

For a second, there was only silence. Then laughter rippled through the crowd. Someone gasped. Someone else raised their phone.

 

I could feel frosting dripping from my hair down to my chin. My hands trembled.

 

Adrian finally turned, and the look in his eyes wasn’t concern. It was disgust.

 

I waited for him to come help me, to say something, anything.

 

But instead, he tightened his grip around Marissa’s shoulders, whispered something to her, and walked away.

 

He didn’t even look back.

 

I stood there, sticky and humiliated under the chandelier’s glow, surrounded by laughter and pity.

 

In that moment the truth was clear, painfully, irreversibly clear. Whenever Marissa needs Adrian, he will always pick her.

 

Not me.

 

I swallowed the lump in my throat and whispered to myself, so quietly no one could hear,

 

“Give up, Rachel. Just give up.” 

 

Yet even as the words left my lips, I still can escape that stubborn, hopeless longing which wells up every time I see his back.

# Chapter 1: The Call

I had been living as someone that was unneeded and unwanted for years because of my chubby figure, but the marriage with my billionaire husband and my adorable daughter tricked me into feeling like I was worth something, even though I was the wife that was hidden away. But the truth is, when I was kidnapped, my husband left me to die, burning in the fire.

 

When I survived and came back as a beautiful, charming woman, he looked at me with full desire.

 

*Please don’t marry him, I am better than him.*

 

He begged for me when I married another man, but it was ridiculous that he didn’t even know who I truly was.

 

This time, it was my turn to play the game.

 

**Chapter 1: The Call**

 

***Rachel’s POV***

 

The smell of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air when my phone buzzed against the counter. I wiped my hands on my apron before picking it up, half expecting it to be Amber’s teacher again about another art project.

 

But when I saw the name on the screen, my stomach fluttered.

 

Adrian.

 

My husband. The man who almost never called.

 

In the five years we had been married, I could count our phone calls on one hand, each one short, polite, and painfully formal. He was the CEO of The Grand Regal Hotel, a man made of schedules and control, not spontaneity. If he was calling now, something was wrong.

 

“Adrian?” I answered, trying to sound calm. “What happened?”

 

“The pastry chef cut his hand,” he said without preamble. His voice was crisp and efficient, the tone he used when delegating work, not speaking to his wife. “We need someone to finish the custom cake for tonight’s movie party.”

 

I blinked. “You mean—?”

 

“I need you to handle it.”

 

For a moment the world stilled. It had been years since I had stepped foot in that kitchen, his kitchen now, but something inside me lifted. The thought of returning to the place where I once poured my heart into flour and sugar filled me with a strange, bittersweet excitement.

 

“I’ll be there right away,” I said quickly.

 

“Don’t mention we’re married,” he interrupted, and my brief warmth froze. “You’re just a former employee helping out.”

 

There it was, the reminder. The invisible line drawn between us. I wasn’t his wife in the public eye, not even a rumor. Our marriage was a contract between two families, signed out of obligation, buried in secrecy.

 

“I know,” I murmured.

 

“Good.” He hung up.

 

No goodbye. No pause. Just silence.

 

I stood there for a moment, my fingers tightening around the phone until my knuckles went white. The air felt thick, heavy with things I never said aloud.

 

No, he was gentle sometimes, but his gentleness was reserved for *that woman.*

 

Just thinking of her filled my heart with bitterness. 

 

Shaking myself out of it, I changed quickly. I slipped into a dark tracksuit, something loose and comfortable. I had put on weight over the years. Every extra curve felt like a reminder of everything I had lost, control, confidence, maybe even him.

 

Still, work was work. I tied my hair back, took one last look in the mirror, and whispered to my reflection, “Just focus on the cake.”

 

By the time I reached The Grand Regal Hotel, my pulse had steadied. The building loomed ahead, sleek glass and marble reflecting the city’s skyline. I had helped build its reputation back when I was head pastry chef, back when my name meant something here.

 

The familiar scent of roasted coffee and vanilla greeted me the moment I stepped inside. My heels clicked softly across the polished floor as I passed old colleagues. Some smiled in surprise; others barely recognized me.

 

And then I saw him.

 

Adrian stood by the kitchen pass, giving orders to the staff. His silver-gray suit fit him perfectly, the crisp line of his shoulders sharp against the soft lighting. His dark blonde hair was combed back neatly, not a single strand out of place. When he turned and saw me, his expression didn’t change.

 

“You’re here,” he said simply, voice even, eyes unreadable. “The cake needs finishing. You have an hour and a half.”

 

“Yes, Mr Parker,” I replied automatically, the words tasting bitter.

 

His gaze lingered for a heartbeat, assessing, distant, all business. Then he turned on his heel and walked away, leaving behind the faint scent of his cologne, cedarwood and distance.

 

When he was gone, the kitchen relaxed.

 

“Rachel! You actually came!” my old sous-chef Greg exclaimed. “We thought tonight was doomed.”

 

“Nice to see you too,” I said, managing a small smile.

 

I slipped into a uniform and moved to the workstation. The half-finished cake sat before me, elegant layers of sponge and cream, delicate sugar roses waiting to bloom.

 

For the next hour, I lost myself in the rhythm of it. My hands moved automatically, smoothing, piping, sculpting, each motion muscle memory. The noise of the kitchen faded until it was just me, sugar, and silence.

 

When the last petal fell into place, Greg let out a low whistle. “You’ve still got it.”

Pots from brands 1, 2, and 3 were made of aluminum and that from brand 4 was made of stainless steel (SST).  The brand 1 is Bialetti Al and brand 4 is Bialetti SST.  So basically, well-sensoning Al moka pots don't show significantly Al leaching concentration in your coffee regardless of brands.  However, after the fifth brew the pots were washed in a dishwasher, then the Al leaching concentration is skyrocket high.  So never ever put your Al moka pots in the dishwasher that can completely ruin your moka pots. Of course, you can still sensoning your moka pot again if you accidently put it in a dishwasher.  One thing to be emphasized is that Stainless Steel Moka pot has Ni and Cr leaching, though it is safe;  but not for Al moka pot.  In short, either Al or SST moka pot is good and safe. However, if you have good despline to clean your moka pot right after use, Al moka pot is fine. Otherwise, you'd better choose SST moka pot. 

  
I own 3 Al and 1 SST moka.  Personanlly, I prefer Al to SST because Al has better heating efficiency.

The cart tipped, and I stumbled with it, landing face-first in what used to be a masterpiece.

 

For a second, there was only silence. Then laughter rippled through the crowd. Someone gasped. Someone else raised their phone.

 

I could feel frosting dripping from my hair down to my chin. My hands trembled.

 

Adrian finally turned, and the look in his eyes wasn’t concern. It was disgust.

 

I waited for him to come help me, to say something, anything.

 

But instead, he tightened his grip around Marissa’s shoulders, whispered something to her, and walked away.

 

He didn’t even look back.

 

I stood there, sticky and humiliated under the chandelier’s glow, surrounded by laughter and pity.

 

In that moment the truth was clear, painfully, irreversibly clear. Whenever Marissa needs Adrian, he will always pick her.

 

Not me.

 

I swallowed the lump in my throat and whispered to myself, so quietly no one could hear,

 

“Give up, Rachel. Just give up.” 

 

Yet even as the words left my lips, I still can escape that stubborn, hopeless longing which wells up every time I see his back.

I (30M) have been with my wife (30F) 11 years, 5 years married. We went to high school together, college together, and now live together. During our college years, which were stressful as we both worked and attended school full-time, she would command and berate me, and she had a lot of freedom in how the relationship went, as I was trying to avoid getting fired or failing school, but there were a lot of fun adventures we would go on too, and things weren't always terrible. So I just went with the flow. I always thought it was just her stress, and it'll be ok, she just needs a safe place, and this will all go away when she's finished with school. Well, now married, I've realized, no, she acts just like her mother, who commands and berates her father, and she is now mirroring her to a T. I am consistently criticized over everything, minor or major, as if there is no difference between the two. I will be greeted with a morning wake-up of her yelling at me for petty things that are not even that major. For example. I was woken up this morning to her yelling at me because when I threw away a dust pan of debris, part of a dust bunny didn't make it in. (The trash is hidden under the counter and can't be seen.) This yelling went on for more than 30 minutes, all before I even had coffee, about how I lack the impetus to do things correctly, attention to detail, and make the home a more stressful area. All while I'm the only one who cooks, sweeps, dishes, laundry, and repairs. And when I say I am the only one who does that, I mean she doesn't even know where the soap and sponges, nor skillets, are.  She consistently tells me I'm fat, unhealthy, and overweight. I have a 22 BMI and work out daily. (all because her 'male friend' has a 10% body fat and abs). I've been doing a bathroom remodel, and I woke up to her yesterday yelling at me because she doesn't like the way the tiles are laid, and that I have to rip everything out that minute before the mortar dries (24-hour setting mortar). When we moved into the house, she yelled at me directly after getting off work because I opened boxes and it ""stressed her out"" like our house wasn't even settled into yet. Our only communication this last year has been her criticizing some form of my work, body, style, or thoughts. I've completely closed down at this point, don't even feel like engaging anymore. She refuses to see a therapist, counselor, etc. I feel happiest when im home alone (I work virtually). Is it normal to feel numb, depleted, and drained in a marriage, or was my view of marriage as being happy and being able to open up to a partner not realistic? 

  
tl;dr: wife consistently criticizes, says I can never do anything to 'standard', Im apparently overweight, and snaps at small triggers. I don't know if I can keep living in this type of environment.  Is it normal to feel numb, depleted, and drained in a marriage, or was my view of marriage as being happy and being able to open up to a partner not realistic?

# Chapter 1: The Call

I had been living as someone that was unneeded and unwanted for years because of my chubby figure, but the marriage with my billionaire husband and my adorable daughter tricked me into feeling like I was worth something, even though I was the wife that was hidden away. But the truth is, when I was kidnapped, my husband left me to die, burning in the fire.

 

When I survived and came back as a beautiful, charming woman, he looked at me with full desire.

 

*Please don’t marry him, I am better than him.*

 

He begged for me when I married another man, but it was ridiculous that he didn’t even know who I truly was.

 

This time, it was my turn to play the game.

 

**Chapter 1: The Call**

 

***Rachel’s POV***

 

The smell of vanilla and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air when my phone buzzed against the counter. I wiped my hands on my apron before picking it up, half expecting it to be Amber’s teacher again about another art project.

 

But when I saw the name on the screen, my stomach fluttered.

 

Adrian.

 

My husband. The man who almost never called.

 

In the five years we had been married, I could count our phone calls on one hand, each one short, polite, and painfully formal. He was the CEO of The Grand Regal Hotel, a man made of schedules and control, not spontaneity. If he was calling now, something was wrong.

 

“Adrian?” I answered, trying to sound calm. “What happened?”

 

“The pastry chef cut his hand,” he said without preamble. His voice was crisp and efficient, the tone he used when delegating work, not speaking to his wife. “We need someone to finish the custom cake for tonight’s movie party.”

 

I blinked. “You mean—?”

 

“I need you to handle it.”

 

For a moment the world stilled. It had been years since I had stepped foot in that kitchen, his kitchen now, but something inside me lifted. The thought of returning to the place where I once poured my heart into flour and sugar filled me with a strange, bittersweet excitement.

 

“I’ll be there right away,” I said quickly.

 

“Don’t mention we’re married,” he interrupted, and my brief warmth froze. “You’re just a former employee helping out.”

 

There it was, the reminder. The invisible line drawn between us. I wasn’t his wife in the public eye, not even a rumor. Our marriage was a contract between two families, signed out of obligation, buried in secrecy.

 

“I know,” I murmured.

 

“Good.” He hung up.

 

No goodbye. No pause. Just silence.

 

I stood there for a moment, my fingers tightening around the phone until my knuckles went white. The air felt thick, heavy with things I never said aloud.

 

No, he was gentle sometimes, but his gentleness was reserved for *that woman.*

 

Just thinking of her filled my heart with bitterness. 

 

Shaking myself out of it, I changed quickly. I slipped into a dark tracksuit, something loose and comfortable. I had put on weight over the years. Every extra curve felt like a reminder of everything I had lost, control, confidence, maybe even him.

 

Still, work was work. I tied my hair back, took one last look in the mirror, and whispered to my reflection, “Just focus on the cake.”

 

By the time I reached The Grand Regal Hotel, my pulse had steadied. The building loomed ahead, sleek glass and marble reflecting the city’s skyline. I had helped build its reputation back when I was head pastry chef, back when my name meant something here.

 

The familiar scent of roasted coffee and vanilla greeted me the moment I stepped inside. My heels clicked softly across the polished floor as I passed old colleagues. Some smiled in surprise; others barely recognized me.

 

And then I saw him.

 

Adrian stood by the kitchen pass, giving orders to the staff. His silver-gray suit fit him perfectly, the crisp line of his shoulders sharp against the soft lighting. His dark blonde hair was combed back neatly, not a single strand out of place. When he turned and saw me, his expression didn’t change.

 

“You’re here,” he said simply, voice even, eyes unreadable. “The cake needs finishing. You have an hour and a half.”

 

“Yes, Mr Parker,” I replied automatically, the words tasting bitter.

 

His gaze lingered for a heartbeat, assessing, distant, all business. Then he turned on his heel and walked away, leaving behind the faint scent of his cologne, cedarwood and distance.

 

When he was gone, the kitchen relaxed.

 

“Rachel! You actually came!” my old sous-chef Greg exclaimed. “We thought tonight was doomed.”

 

“Nice to see you too,” I said, managing a small smile.

 

I slipped into a uniform and moved to the workstation. The half-finished cake sat before me, elegant layers of sponge and cream, delicate sugar roses waiting to bloom.

 

For the next hour, I lost myself in the rhythm of it. My hands moved automatically, smoothing, piping, sculpting, each motion muscle memory. The noise of the kitchen faded until it was just me, sugar, and silence.

 

When the last petal fell into place, Greg let out a low whistle. “You’ve still got it.”

 

Adrian came back just as I was setting down the piping bag. He examined the cake in silence, his eyes scanning every detail. After what felt like forever, he nodded once.

 

“Well done,” he said.

 

Two simple words, but my heart surged. At home he rarely noticed the small things. But here, as his employee, my work still meant something.

 

I forced a steady smile. “Thank you, sir.”

 

He turned away. “Help me move it to the banquet hall.”

 

We pushed the cake cart together through the gilded corridors. The hum of conversation grew louder as we neared the lobby. The film company’s party was already in full swing, laughter, glasses clinking, the faint sound of jazz echoing through marble halls.

 

I tried to keep my head down. My palms were sweaty against the handle of the cart. Then I heard Adrian’s breath catch. His attention fixed ahead, and when I followed his gaze, my stomach dropped.

 

A woman in a crimson silk dress stood by the bar, her golden curls catching the light. Even from across the room, I recognized her instantly.

 

*Marissa.*

 

She was arguing with a man whose hand rested far too low on her back. Before I could blink, Adrian was gone, striding across the floor like a storm.

 

“Let her go!” His voice boomed over the music.

 

The man stumbled back, startled. Adrian caught Marissa’s wrist and pulled her close, shielding her as though she were something fragile.

 

And that was when his shoulder hit the cake cart.

 

Time slowed. The three-tiered cake tilted forward in dreadful slow motion. I lunged, trying to steady it, but the weight overpowered me. The whole thing crashed onto the marble floor, icing, fruit, cream, everything exploding like a grotesque snowstorm.

Silly me thought it would be an awesome idea to install windows before having my moring coffee. I had just made a super backup for all my files in an NVME ssd and carefully spent 2 weeks organizing them for my new pc. During windows install I hit delete on the wrong partition, immediately recognized it and quit. 

I didn't write anything in it, read it from another windows pc trough an USB adapter and tried using testdisk, recuva, ufs explorer and DMDE - but the only files I could find that dated before the whoopsie where IndexerVolumeGuid, tracking.log and WPsettings.

For some reason, diskmanagement shows it as a healthy primary partition, not unnalocated space.
I don’t know if this is something that the win 10 installer does or it was bc there was another partition in it when I did the whoopsie.

I am not going to send it to a pro recovery since I have all the data in other places (man, it is a lot of places) but wanted to give a shot to save the herculean work that was organizing this drive, at least getting the folder and filenames would be exceptional.

Any tips that I should try? Maybe plugging it on the m.2 port instead of the usb? Or TRIM basically completely screwed 2TB of data just like that?

**EXCERPT FROM: MY LIFE AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT** by Amina Noor Baloch, Published by Moon River Publisher, Collection: Heroes of Our Times Date: c. 211X

It did not take me three days. Honestly? It barely took five hours. Five hours of this total adrenaline-dump tour where my brain was basically vibrating in my skull. Every single lab I walked into felt like stepping into a dream where the laws of physics were just... suggestions. Everything was filled with this crazy sense of wonder, and the people there were actually super chill. They were doing their absolute best to explain the literal magic they were working with in a way that didn't make me feel like a total idiot.

I think they were used to talking to geniuses, not a girl who still remembers the smell of the goat market. There were these two guys, probably not much older than me, and this one woman with really cool glowing tech-implants who kept hitting on me—gently, you know? Like, testing the waters. I’ve lived enough life to know how to play the 'clueless' card perfectly without making things awkward or insulting anyone. I just kept my eyes on the tech and my heart in my throat. By the time the tour was over, I didn't need any more time. I was already home.

I lay in my bed that night, staring up at the ceiling and pretending to actually weigh the pros and cons, but it was just a performance for an audience of one. The choice had been made in my gut five hours ago, probably the second I saw the holographic schematics for the heavy-lift drives. I was going to the Far Side. I was going to the Shipyard.

People back on the ground—the ones with their grey suits and their endless, soul-crushing spreadsheets—they talk about the Moon like it’s just a rock. They use words like ‘logistics’ and ‘feasibility’ and ‘budgetary constraints.’ To them, it’s all just numbers on a screen, a way to say ‘no’ to anything that doesn't fit in a box. That’s their weapon: incredulity. They can’t imagine a chariot of Ra because they’re too busy calculating the cost of the gold leaf. They think the void is a problem to be solved, not a kingdom to be claimed.

But out there, in the shadow of the craters where the Earth can't see us, we will be building something that’s going to make the sun look like a candle. We will take on Apophis—that great serpent of the old world’s chaos and its boring, stagnant doubt. I want to be the one holding the torch. I want to be the one who turns the 'impossible' into a flight plan. The Far Side isn't just a place; it's the only place where the spreadsheets finally stop making noise and the stars start to talk back.

The following morning, the breakfast was already waiting outside my door—something that smelled like real cinnamon and expensive coffee, way too fancy for a girl who used to be happy with a handful of dates. But I didn't even look at the tray. I walked straight to the wall terminal, my palm itching. The second I put my hand on the sensor plate, it felt warm, like the building itself was checking my pulse to see if I was lying.

“Amina Noor Baloch, did you make your choice?”

The words on the screen were small, but they felt like they were screaming. I didn't whisper. I didn't mumble. I stood up straight and said it like I was already standing on the Lunar regolith: “I choose the shipyard. I'm going to the Moon.”

The screen blinked once, turned a deep, satisfied blue, and then went dark. A second later, my pad on the nightstand started vibrating like it was trying to burrow through the wood. I grabbed it, my fingers shaking just a little.

***Amina Noor Baloch, you have been provisionally assigned to the Moon Project Excalibur.*** I blinked at the word “provisional assignment.”

Then the rest appears:

***Confirmation upon obtaining a Deep Space Working Certificate.***

That one was new.

1. ***Radiation protection treatment—in the medical department of this facility***
2. ***Zero-G movements, work, and sex certification—a two-week course in the orbital training center***
3. ***Initiation to Zero-G craft piloting—same facility as above—objective: discouraging any impulse of manual piloting in space.***

I yelled at the pad, “No way I’m having sex in public in a classroom! Or ever!”

The pad had no mic, but the wall terminal must have picked it up:

***Zero-G sex training consists of watching a mandatory video. Engaging in such activity with a chosen partner is totally optional. Most students find that activity the best part of the certification.***

You bet! So, let’s go to Number One. I’d heard that everybody was given an injection before going up there to protect against the nasty effects of space radiation above the Van Allen belt, which shields Earth from the solar wind. I finished my breakfast as fast as I could, only to find the same LEDs waiting for me, guiding me back to that underground elevator. This time, we didn't just go to the bottom; we went through the bottom. For a split second, I saw what looked like a subterranean harbor—a massive, echoing vault with a submarine so gigantic it looked like a sleeping whale made of steel. Then I landed in a hospital.

The LEDs led me into an examination room that looked more like a VIP lounge than a doctor’s office. It had this super plush armchair, a holographic communicator, and a strange-looking transparent coffin sitting in the corner that gave me the chills.

Suddenly, the communicator flickered to life, and a representation of a Sibil appeared.

“Hi Amina, I’m Esculape Sibil, Chief Doctor of the SLAM Corporation. How are you today? I heard that you are an adult who has made her first real choice in life?”

Even though I knew 'he' was probably talking to hundreds of people at the same time while monitoring thousands of life parameters, I actually liked him. He sounded sympathetic and buoyant, like he was genuinely happy I was there.

“I’m great,” I said, trying to look way more confident than I actually felt. I didn't want him seeing the part of me that was still a terrified kid from the street. “But seriously, why do I need the Chief Doctor for a simple shot? Did I accidentally sign up for a heart transplant or something?”

He gave me this dramatic wink, leaning into the whole 'old-timey movie star' vibe he had going on. “My, my, not inducted into the holiest procedure of the corporation yet, are you?” He chuckled, and it sounded like real, warm human laughter. “Injections are for the workers, Amina. They have to get poked every three months. But you? You’re special. You’re getting the upgrade. A tiny device—consisting of a long-life power cell and a nanoparticle generator. You’ll be shielded for the next century.”

My brain did a literal record-scratch. “Whoa, hold on. No way. I am not having a mini Helios generator shoved inside me. I’m not trying to end up like a piece of fried chicken, cooked from the inside out!”

Esculape let out a light laugh. “Nothing that dramatic, I promise. It’s just a tiny nuclear battery.”

“A WHAT?!)” I practically jumped out of the chair.

He just smirked. “Relax, kid. I’m joking. But the nanoparticle generator? That’s the mandatory part. Reid has one, Clarissa and Brenda have them, so don’t even bother fighting it. It’s just the cost of doing business in the stars.”

He leaned in closer to me, his expression getting a little more serious. “However, there are two optional upgrades I strongly recommend you take. One is an integrated safeguard in case of... well, let’s call it a major biological failure. Say a micro-meteorite decides to turn your heart and lungs into Swiss cheese. This little beauty keeps your brain fed and oxygenated, even after your body has technically checked out, so we have enough time to bring you to a repair shop and fix you properly.”

The air in the room suddenly felt like it was made of lead. My stomach did a slow, nauseating roll. “That... that’s what happened to Reid, isn't it? In the submarine?”

Esculape nodded slowly. “Exactly. We had three months to rebuild his body from the ground up before the final reboot.”

*Reboot.* The word echoed in my head, cold and metallic. My heart was thumping against my ribs. *Reboot.* Like he’s a fucking laptop. Just hit 'Control-Alt-Delete' and hope the OS isn't corrupted. God, these people are absolutely insane. These people? My people.

I could feel my hands starting to shake a little in my lap. I tried to steady my voice. ""And the other one? The second 'upgrade'?""

Esculape waved a hand like he was swatting a fly. ""Oh, that? Barely worth mentioning, really. Just a direct link between your grey matter and the Sibil network. High-speed, brain-to-WiFi interface. Don't worry, it’s got a firewall like a fortress—nothing gets in or out unless you explicitly ask for it. No random thoughts leaking into the cloud. But it’s a total game-changer. You can request calculations, simulations, order equipment… Also, it’ll open doors, call elevators, and let you pilot a ship just by *thinking* about it. Standard stuff, really.""

I gripped the arms of that plush chair so hard my knuckles turned white. *Now* I get why the chair is so soft. It’s to catch you before you hit the floor. One more 'standard' insane detail and I’m going to need that fucking death-safeguard just to survive this conversation.

""Okay, just for kicks,"" I said, trying to make my voice sound steady even though my pulse was doing a drum solo in my neck. ""How many people have actually gone through with this? How many are ‘safeguarded and integrated’?""

Esculape didn't even have to look it up. ""Out of our million-plus employees? Exactly one thousand four hundred and fifty-three. And before you start worrying about your schedule, you won’t spend more than forty-eight hours in this medical bay.""

Fourteen hundred. Out of a freaking million. That’s a tiny-ass number. It’s the kind of statistic that tells you you’re either joining the gods or the most expensive suicide cult in history. It’s the kind of decision that makes your stomach do backflips, the kind you shouldn't think about for more than a second or you'll never do it.

""Fine,"" I said, standing up. ""But if this fails and I wake up as some digital vegetable, I am going to haunt you for all eternity. I'm talking serious poltergeist shit. Where do I sign?""

The transparent coffin—the 'bay'—slid open with a soft, clinical hiss. I looked back at the screen to see if Esculape was impressed by my bravado, but the communicator was dark. He was already gone.

I woke up in my own bed, upstairs. Another breakfast was already waiting, the same as usual. It felt like I’d spent my entire life on this strange island just eating breakfast and talking to ghosts. I looked around for my pad—nothing. I must have left it down in that creepy medical basement. I dragged myself over to the wall terminal, but before I could even touch the sensor, a line of text just... appeared. Not on the wall. Not on a screen. It was just floating there in the air, right in front of my face like a ghost.

***Sub-vocalize: 'get directions'.***

My heart skipped a beat. I didn't even open my mouth; I just thought the words, moving my throat muscles like I was whispering a secret to myself. *Get directions.*

Immediately, a tiny, glowing line of text popped up in the corner of my eye, tracking with my vision: ***Take pod to STO-Slam Training Orbital. Send acknowledgement.***

“ACK,” I whispered, or thought, or whatever the hell I was doing with my brain-wi-fi.

***Use the same procedure for whatever you need.***

1pyf4qp,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pyf4qp/update_to_i_21ftm_have_to_choose_between_cutting/,"Update to ""I (21FTM) have to choose between cutting off my mother or my fiance (24 NB) and idk what to do""","It has been a long and yet short 2 days. There hasn't been some huge crazy update but this is where I am at with it all rn and could use some extra advice that is outside of my friends who know my fiance and I.

So later the night before we were expecting my mother to show up in the morning after a bit of space and crying my fiance game back to whereI was in the livingroom and we talked back and forth about how I had pushed a boundary but they were sorry for giving me an ultimatum. Eventually we got to the round about spot of them saying we could either ignore her if she showed up in the morning or tell her we would meet her for coffee across from where we live at Tim Hortons and point out the house from outside, she just couldn't come in. By this point I was so burnt out and tired that I said I would like to do the 2nd option. It was 5 am at this point, I sent a text to my mom letting her know the plan for the morning, and went to go to bed with my fiance. My fiance asked a few more questions along the lines of if given the chance would I leave to go to the college I was looking to transfer to in the spring instead of taking my gap year, etc. I couldnt give them an answer, because yes I would but only if they were coming too. After a few minutes they asked quietly if I could go to the couch for the night and I said okay.

The next morning my alarm woke me up and a bit before the meeting I went into the bedroom to see if my fiance was up, and they were. They said to tell my mom they weren't feeling well, but after seeing how red my eyes still were from the evening prior decided to come with me. We were quiet when walking over to the coffee shop, and quieter while waiting, I was trying to find a way to break the ice. Eventually my mom and younger brother arrived and we got up to get our orders placed. My fiance made theirs first, and usually they would turn and ask what I wanted but this time they said nothing and paid. My mom and brother placed their orders, getting a couple things as they had never gotten timmy's before as we're from the states. I then placed my order with my mom and brother's and my mom leaned over to my fiance and asked if they got something already, to which they said they had.

I was barely able to eat any of what I got (same for the day prior) because I was so nauseous from anxiety at this time. I didnt want another big fight like at Christmas dinner or for my mother to accuse my fiance of being abusive again. But to my surprise it all went really smoothly. I mean all 4 of us were laughing, talking about things from when I was growing up, my mom and fiance were sharing pictures of things like me, pets, etc. It was jarring but gave me hope things could go back to usual. Time came where my mom and brother had to get back on the road so my fiance pointed out our house and I hugged my mom goodbye and they left. On our walk back home while we didnt say much my fiance still treated me more normally like they do when we're walking places (I can get a bit spacey so sometimes they'll help lmk whats going on, or catch me to pull be away from smth I wasnt aware I was about to crash into, etc).

But as soon as we got back into the house they went dull again, took off their coat, gloves, scarf, and boots without a word and went to the bedroom. I took this as them wanting space from me so I gave it, I went back to the couch and went back to sleep. When I woke up it was probably around 5 pm ish and after a few I guess my fiance heard me moving about and knew I was awake. So round 2 of the argument commenced.. 

They didnt come and face me head on with the beginning part as it was clear they were angry and know how I startle and freeze when voices get raised, so instead they texted me how they couldn't feel safe with me in the house after I broke a boundary like that, and that they wanted me to get out. I took it as them wanting to be done with me and to leave so I asked if I could pack my stuff first. Then it went into how they just wanted me to show them thag they could trust me again and and show I was sorry (I had said I was sorry numerous times over the past few days because of all this mess). Then said that if I could face them on and look them in the eyes that I wouldn't do smth like this again then we could go from that. I walked into the room and told them I dont want to do it again and where I am in the moment with my fear of my mother that I cant trust myself not to but I want to get better so I dont cross boundaries like this again. 

I dont fully remember the things we said at this point but I do remember saying how I know who I am and it isnt fair to them that I have the possibility of caving to my mother more or doing something else to screw things up. Which ironically is what I had said I was sure would happen at the beginning of our relationship, that I would be the one to ruin it. But in the end my anxiety rules me like im a dog and I know that I need help, but getting it terrifies me (ive been off and on with therapists and medications that's barely done anything, it just all gets so overwhelming for me). While it isnt huge jumps I have gotten to a place where I can mildly stand up for myself, it just takes me a little bit to get the courage to speak up, and honestly I owe that to my fiance's constant support. There was a point where they offered me their medication (an ssri for their depression and anxiety thats a low dose) to see if that helped me but I declined it.

But anyways I didnt want to keep potentially hurting them with how I am so I said I would pack my stuff and go back to my family for a little bit so I was in a familiar environment to ground myself and get help. To which my fiance panicked and started begging for me not to (I too had been crying this whole time because I love them so much it hurts). When I started packing my clothes they asked me to stop and I didnt, saying it was for the best, but that I didnt want to leave them, just take a bit of space to get better. But they said if I was leaving then we would be done. During the peak of all this they walked out of the bedroom and came back with my car keys saying that now I couldn't leave and I would have to try and steal theirs if I wanted to. Which immediately made me panic and terrified.

They have never ever been the kind of person to do something like litteraly trap me. They have never raised a hand to me, never yelled at me, always been the best they could, and work on themself to do better in small moments that they slipped up and I pointed it out. But growing up in an unstable house myself where multiple of the men my mother dated were controlling and abusive like that it terrified me and I froze. 

After a minute they faltered in what they were doing, tossed me my car keys gently, and immediately started apologizing for it. They asked me to not leave them and to at least think about it as I was most likely acting out of my fight or flight panic. I gave them a hug during this time as they had started hyperventilating and I didnt know what else to do, it seems like whatever im doing its hurting the person I love the most.. they gripped my forearm pretty tight during this and while that never would have been an issue for me with them in the past, I was still triggered from them taking my car keys and had to pull my arm away. They clearly seemed to note me pulling back to sit across from them, we talked for a little longer and there were moments where they went to touch my knee as they usually would to comfort me but pulled back to respect my space. Eventually I just told them I was going back to the couch for the night, and they said they would give me space.

I stayed there for the evening (luckily our couch is honestly pretty comfortable compared to our bed, so I dont mind having to sleep there) there was a small moment when I left the bedroom where my fiance asked if I wanted my heating pad or anything, but I said I was fine. Before I went to sleep I texted 2 friends for some input but neither really gave me something to work with as they both said it is my choice for if I should stay or go with it all. Both did agree the key thing is a red flag but also out of character for them. In the end I went to sleep.

I woke up sometime around 5 am being so incredibly nauseous from my lack of food, I had to crawl over to the bathroom and just layed on the floor for hours incase I threw up. At some point they came to check on me since the bathroom light had been on so long they got worried I was doing something. When they found out it was just me feeling sick form not eating for basically the past 2 days they went and got me smth to eat, and asked if I wanted a pillow or smth too, I said no thank you (ive always found just being on the floor on a towel comforting when I felt sick like this rather than a pillow or smth soft). They left me to be and I managed to eat a little, enough to feel better at least and passed out for a bit on the floor. I woke back up sometime around 8 am and felt good enough to make my food and go back to where I was on the couch.

For the whole day we pretty much stayed in our 2 spaces, me in the livingroom, and my fiance in the bedroom as they were giving me space for it all. I was and honestly still am a bit spooked about the whole ordeal from the night before, I had never felt scared of them a day in my life until that moment.. 

Sometime in the evening they ended up going out for a few hours to give me space, so I was able to take a shower and cook peacefully and relax a little. We both did make sure the other ate and stuff briefly while they were gone, and they checked to see if I needed anything from the store. We haven't really properly had a conversation when they got back about what's going on with us, but they did text me to say that if I do leave for me to please do it while theyre at work because they wont want to do smth irrational again.

At this point I dont know if I should leave or.stay. I love them so much, but lastnight scared me so much, I havent been able to settle down really since. One of my friends (who is the closest to where we are, being a 6 hour drive from here) did offer me their couch if I do need it. Another friend suggested I leave for a couple days for space and then come back to work things out, but im worried about leaving my things behind now. Where do I go from here?

1pyf0cv,https://www.reddit.com/r/privatehealthcoveruk/comments/1pyf0cv/are_health_apps_and_wearables_covered_by_pmi/,Are Health Apps and Wearables Covered by PMI,"Hi all,

I've been looking into how PMI providers are integrating tech like health apps and wearables into their policies and thought a summary of the key points might be useful for the community. It seems the industry is shifting from a passive safety net to a more proactive approach.

The core idea is what some call a ""shared value"" model. Insurers are incentivising members to engage in healthier behaviours with the goal of reducing future claims. In theory, this is a win-win: members get tangible rewards and tools to support their health, and insurers see lower claims costs, which can help keep premiums more competitive over time.

This is primarily done through optional health and wellness rewards programmes. You can choose to connect a wearable device (like a Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple Watch) or your smartphone's health app to the insurer's platform. The platform then tracks your activity and converts it into points.

Common ways to earn points include:
- Physical activity like hitting daily step counts, tracking a run, or visiting a partner gym.
- Completing online health checks or assessments.
- Engaging with mental wellbeing apps like Headspace or Calm.
- Some insurers are also beginning to incorporate sleep tracking.

As you accumulate points, you typically move up status levels (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold), which unlocks better rewards. These can range from a free weekly coffee or cinema tickets to significant discounts on your policy renewal. Vitality is probably the most well-known provider with a model built entirely around this concept, but others are integrating similar features.

Full disclosure: these insights are from a guide I work on.

I'm curious to hear from the community on this. For those with a wellness programme included in your policy, do you find the rewards are a genuine motivator for you, or are they more of a 'nice-to-have' perk? And for those without, is this something you'd actively look for when choosing a provider?

It’s a day of total neural chaos. Welcome to *Keeping Up with the Cranium*.

Scene 1: The Amygdala’s Meltdown

**Khloe** (The **Amygdala**) is currently pacing the marble kitchen, clutching her phone like a weapon. She has just seen a blurry paparazzi photo of her ex at a club. She isn't just upset; she is a ""limbic system"" category five hurricane.

""I am literally **shaking**! I want to throw this juice at the wall! I want to scream!"" Khloe shrieks. Her face is flushed, her heart is racing, and she is oscillating between pure **aggression** and paralyzing **fear** that her life is over. She is the family’s raw emotion center. When there’s a threat—real or perceived—Khloe is the first to fire an action potential of pure drama.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Amygdala is the brain's ""aggression center,"" responsible for producing feelings of anger, violence, fear, and anxiety.**

Scene 2: The Prefrontal Cortex Intervenes

In walks **Kris** (The **Prefrontal Cortex**), wearing a power suit and holding a clipboard. She doesn't scream. She doesn't cry. She looks at Khloe with the cold, analytical gaze of a woman who knows how to edit a storyline.

""Khloe, honey, you're making a scene in front of the help,"" Kris says, her voice a calm, low hum of **executive function**. ""Take a breath. We aren't throwing juice. We are going to **plan** a response. We are going to **decide** on a narrative. We are going to **regulate** these emotions so we don't look like a mess on E!.""

Kris is the matriarch for a reason. She sits at the very front of the house (the brain), and her job is to **inhibit** the wild impulses of the younger girls. She handles the **problem-solving** and makes sure the family’s **social behavior** stays ""on brand"".

**MCAT Takeaway: The Prefrontal Cortex is responsible for higher-order functions like planning, decision-making, and regulating social behavior by inhibiting the impulses of the limbic system.**

Scene 3: The Thalamus Filters the Noise

At the front door stands **Corey Gamble** (The **Thalamus**). He is the ultimate gatekeeper. A frantic delivery man is trying to bring in a box of ""urgent"" fan mail, a stylist is shouting about a missing zipper, and the doorbell is ringing incessantly.

Corey doesn't let everyone in. He stands there, calm and stoic, acting as the **sensory relay station**. He hears the noise, sees the chaos, and tastes the tension in the air. He directs the stylist to the wardrobe room (the **visual cortex**) and sends the mail to Kris’s office (the **frontal cortex**). However, when a waft of expensive ""Kim Kardashian Eau de Parfum"" drifts through the room, he doesn't even have to process it—it goes straight to the sisters’ rooms.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Thalamus acts as a relay station for all sensory information—vision, hearing, and taste—directing it to the appropriate cortical areas, though smell is the only sense that bypasses it.**

Scene 4: The Hippocampus Keeps the Receipts

**Kim** (The **Hippocampus**) is sitting in her ""glam room,"" but she’s not looking in the mirror. She’s scrolling through a digital vault of every text message sent since 2012.

""I remember exactly what was said,"" Kim whispers. ""I have the receipts. I am forming a **long-term record** of this betrayal.""

Kim’s entire career is built on her ability to take a short-term moment and **convert it into a permanent memory** that can be referenced for seasons to come. If you destroy Kim, the family loses its history. They would live in a perpetual ""now,"" unable to form new storylines or remember who they are currently feuding with.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Hippocampus is essential for memory formation, specifically the conversion of short-term memories into long-term memories.**

Scene 5: The Hypothalamus and the Boundaries

**Kourtney** (The **Hypothalamus**) is currently lying on a silk chaise lounge, refusing to join the drama. She is holding a thermometer and a bottle of alkaline water.

""My **homeostasis** is off,"" Kourtney moans. ""The vibes in this house are affecting my **body temperature**. My **hormones** are literally spiraling because of the stress. I need to regulate my **internal environment**.""

While the others are worried about the press, Kourtney is worried about her **pituitary gland**. She is the ""wellness"" center, constantly checking if the house is too hot or too cold, and making sure everyone’s **thirst** and **hunger** are satisfied—but only with gluten-free, organic options. She is the bridge between the drama and the physical body.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Hypothalamus maintains homeostasis by regulating the autonomic nervous system, controlling body temperature, hunger, and thirst, and governing the endocrine system via the pituitary gland.**

Scene 6: The Cerebellum’s Runway Walk

Suddenly, **Kendall** (The **Cerebellum**) struts through the hallway. She is carrying three iced coffees, her phone, and a small dog, all while wearing six-inch stilettos on a freshly waxed floor. She doesn't stumble. She doesn't wobble. Her **motor coordination** is hauntingly perfect.

""How do you do that?"" Khloe asks, still shaking from her Amygdala-firestorm.

""It’s called **balance**, Khloe,"" Kendall says, executing a flawless pivot. She’s not thinking about the steps; her brain is automatically calculating the **position of her limbs** in space and correcting her **posture** in real-time. She takes the ""motor plan"" from Kris and turns it into a graceful, coordinated reality.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Cerebellum is responsible for coordinating voluntary movement, maintaining balance and posture, and smoothing out motor activities.**

Scene 7: The Brainstem—The ""Quiet"" Foundation

Down in the basement (the very base of the house), the **Brainstem** is working silently. This is the **foundation** that keeps the lights on, the water running, and the air circulating.

While the sisters argue about ""who’s the least interesting to look at,"" the Brainstem ensures their **breathing** doesn't stop and their **heart rates** don't flatline from the shock of a bad tweet. Within this foundation lives a small, alert security team—the **Reticular Formation**—who determines if the sisters are **awake** and **alert** enough to film, or if it’s time to go into a deep sleep. Without this base, the Kardashians wouldn't just be ""canceled""—they’d be biologically offline.

**MCAT Takeaway: The Brainstem connects the brain to the spinal cord and controls vital autonomic functions like respiration and heart rate; it also houses the reticular formation, which regulates arousal and alertness.**

The Finale: The ""Hippo Wearing a HAT""

As the episode wraps, the family gathers for a ""confessional."" They realize they are all connected in one big, messy, emotional loop. They call it the **Limbic System**.

Kris (PFC) tries to manage them, but she knows that as long as they have their **Hippo wearing a HAT** (**Hippo**campus, **H**ypothalamus, **A**mygdala, **T**halamus), there will always be memories to exploit, internal balances to maintain, anger to fire off, and sensory drama to relay.

""The drama is biological,"" Kris says, looking directly into the camera. ""And the ratings? They’re purely psychological.""",0,1766989436.0,Mcat,1,0.5,False

1pyesi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1pyesi6/after_20_years_idk_if_i_can_be_in_the_same_room/,"After 20 years, idk if I can be in the same room as my moms bf anymore","Throw away acct 

I’m in my mid-twenties, and my biological dad was never around. I’ve made peace with that. That’s not why I dislike my mom’s boyfriend. In fact, I genuinely want my mom to find a man who treats her well and is worth keeping.

My mom has been dating this man, who I’ll call Doug, for almost 20 years, and their relationship has never been stable. He has cheated on her dozens of times, had four children with four different women while they were together, and even pulled her into a throuple situation where he pitted her against another woman and then emotionally strung that woman along for years. He openly calls women “gardening tool”. That is just scratching the surface.

One of my earliest core memories of him says a lot. We were at his house playing Monopoly, and when I was about to win, he flipped the board over and said game over.

My mom believes he has changed. She says he has been working hard in therapy and is a different person now. I want that to be true for her. But from where I stand, it is hard to trust that anything is truly different. To me, he still feels controlling and manipulative, like he is wearing a mask long enough to get her to move in and take on a caretaker role for his kids.

I have tried to give him a fair chance. Last year he took me out for coffee to apologize for never building a relationship with me and for how he treated my mom. The apology did not feel sincere. It felt like something he was told to do. He actually admitted this when he said the therapist said he has no chance with my mom if he doesn’t reconcile the relationship between him and I. Since then, there has been no effort to actually show up or build anything.

In nearly 20 years, he has never bought me a birthday or Christmas present. At the same time, my mom has consistently shown up for his kids financially, emotionally, and without hesitation, like they were her own.

Recently, we had a family Christmas Eve dinner at a nice restaurant where he shows up 25 minutes late (mind you, my family has just now began to be willing to try again and include him on things) because he had to work (mind you again, he is self employed). 
Afterwards I let him come to my boyfriend’s family Christmas Eve party. While there, he commented that the patterned tights my mom was wearing were what the hoochies wore back in the day. That comment has stayed with me.

What hurts the most is watching my mom continue to accept so little after giving so much. I do not hate him because I want to. I hate that I do not feel safe trusting him, and that despite my efforts, the pattern has not changed.
I’m just not sure if I’ll ever be able to truly accept him
