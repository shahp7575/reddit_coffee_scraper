I agreed- didn‚Äôt expect much. Just did a few simple actions with a wallet.  
Two days later- $530 showed up in my account. Still not sure how it worked, but it did.

1me2hyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1me2hyt/my_26m_wife_26f_kicked_me_out_and_she_wants_me_to/,My (26M) wife (26F) kicked me out and she wants me to apologize! Who is in the wrong? Should I feel like im the problem?," So the other day, I woke up at 10 am to get out 18 month old daughter out of bed. Usually we like to have her up much earlier, but my wife and I slept in. I get her up, feed her bottle and play with her until my wife gets up. My wife then grabs her usual cup of coffee. She then sits on the couch beside me and begins to conversate with me, as we often do in the morning. At some point in our morning talk, I mentioned that I had a friendly debate with my own mother about Feminism. Understandably that's a pretty hot topic, but essentially my stance is that women can be treated as equals,.but because of our actual anatomical differences, we are not equals from creation. 

 What I mean by this is that just because we can both vote doesn't mean we are truely equal through and through. I have never said on sex is better or worse than the other. We are different and there fore by definition not equal. I really don't hate women. In some cases I think women are better than men but this is all besides the point.

 So my wife says to me, something like, gee wiz you and your mom always have these hot topic debates and I'm kinda jealous. So I said ok well this is what I think. Soon my wife started getting snippy, saying something about how heartless I am for not liking feminism. She mentioned how we are equal in spirit. I didn't disagree but I reminded her that we have differences as individuals, therefore by definition we cannot but equals in totality. She didn't like my opinion so she called me an asshole.

 It hurt coming from my wife, whom I have been with for 8 years (it was our anniversary that day), but I'm man, I can handle it. So I brushed it off. She had planned on going grocery shopping that morning, but she left angry. So I took care of our daughter, feed her brunch, changed diaper, put her down for nap. Just regular parent stuff, no biggie right?

 Well my wife gets back and she's ok now, doesn't seem upset. couple hours go by, now shes going bowling with her sisters. Turns out the alley was closed so they just went shopping. When she got back she walked past me and didn't even look in my direction, very unusual action for her. She then walked by again and chucked a shirt in my face and said with an snarky tone; ""here, I bought you a shirt"".

 Before I could say anything she started giving me the gears, telling me how I'm an asshole for voicing my opinion on feminism(once again guys, please, I love women. I just believe feminism is a government psyop to control our political systems by abusing women's emotion through news(controversial I know but i don't see women as less, they just need extra protection because they are more vulnerable to manipulation by propaganda)).

 At this point I'm pretty upset so I begin to reflect the harsh tone she is using against me. Well apparently that's not a nice way to talk because she again calls me an asshole which I reminded her that she called me one earlier that day. Some how she denied it entirely saying that she didn't say that at all. I told her yes infact you did. Now she was fuming. She started yelling at me, getting angrier and angrier.

 All the sudden! She says IT!!! ""I don't want to be here at all"". Shocked, I was silent for a moment. She then said ""Either you can smarten up or you can fuck off"". So feeling mistreated and misunderstood, I immediately stood up and got in my car and left. I called my best friend and went to his fiancee's mom's house to spend time with them. To talk things over and cool down.

 4 days go by, which btw are just awful, I feel like shit for getting talked down to and booted out. She finally texts me saying all this about me bringing evil into the home and how I emotionally abuse her. Wow. I was at work again when I received this terrible messages from the woman who is supposed to understand and love me. I was devastated.

 The accusations of abuse can condem a man, I have a daughter that I love so dearly, many female relatives and friends that would think very poorly if I was labeled an abuser. I cried for an hour (something I rarley do, as usually I am very in control of my emotions).

 So yeah, that's the story. I can imagine that alot of people may not like what I say about Feminism. I honestly believe that it's ok to have different opinions, otherwise you might as well colour is all grey and change all our names to Bob. I ask you, the reader, please understand that I want the best for women. For me I believe that we need a new system that appreciates women for who they are, instead of competing with men in fields that are designed around the male mind and body. I feel as though I stuck a nerve with my wife.

 Even if I am completely wrong about my opinion, I don't see how someone could flip out and treat me so badly. What do I do now?

 I have pictures of her texts that she sent me. I can totally add something about that but this post is long enough.",0,1753970709.0,AITAH,8,0.5,False

You‚Äôre wrapped in a faded shawl on a plastic chair that creaks with every ounce of your doubt. There‚Äôs a half-eaten packet of Hide & Seek on the table. Your laptop has 36 tabs open, none helpful, all terrifying.

Your roommate is snoring on the top bunk, having passed out mid-revision of M. Laxmikanth‚Äôs Emergency provisions, you know this because he underlined ‚ÄúArticle 356‚Äù before collapsing like a fallen warrior.

You, though? You're stuck on question 9 of a vision test and suddenly doubting if democracy was ever a good idea to begin with.

You traded a stable relationship for ‚Äúone last attempt,‚Äù quit your job that gave you free coffee and quarterly bonuses, and now the only appreciation you get is when your test evaluator gives you a smiley next to *‚Äúneeds better structure.‚Äù*

You told your friends you‚Äôre doing this for the country. Truth is, you just didn‚Äôt know what else to do.

 **UPSC Aspirant‚Äôs Heartbreak:**

. Month 1: Motivation. Vision boards. Neat notes. ‚ÄúThis is my year.‚Äù  
. Month 3: Doubt. Panic. Backlogs. ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not cut out for this?‚Äù  
. Month 6: Enlightenment. You‚Äôre now an amateur expert in macroeconomics, IR, and inner suffering.  
. Month 9: Detachment. You talk to no one, dream in bullet points, and your crush is now a District Magistrate you saw on YouTube.

You wake up at 6AM with four alarms. You fall asleep with your nose pressed to NCERTs from 2005. You‚Äôve stopped telling people you‚Äôre an aspirant. You just say:  
‚ÄúPreparing.‚Äù  
Not because you‚Äôre shy, but because there‚Äôs no damn end to it. Just layers of pain in different packaging: Prelims, Mains, Interview. Repeat.

 **Ecosystem:**  
You study in a library where every chair has a name, not of donors, but of those who quit.  
You wear kurtas that haven‚Äôt been ironed since the last mains.  
You know which chai stall gives extra sugar and which photocopy guy adds value with PYQs.  
You‚Äôve bookmarked threads, toppers, PDFs, notes, air purifiers, heartbreaks, and strategies.

Every failure teaches you something. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs never how to pass.

**And Still‚Ä¶ You Stay.**

Why?????

Because one day you saw a woman in a cotton saree, surrounded by villagers, holding a mic and *listening*. And you thought: *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs what I want to be.‚Äù*  
Because you once read about a 22-year-old IAS officer getting roads built in a remote district, and it made your eyes sting.  
Because despite everything, you *believe*.  
That *maybe, just maybe*, it‚Äôll be your name on that list next year.

So you get back to your desk. You open the Hindu.  
You highlight a random editorial that‚Äôll never be asked.  
You sip your watery coffee. You grind through the next page.  
You continue. WHY?????

1me2e6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1me2e6r/explore_the_keurig_kelite_coffee_maker_is_it/,Explore the Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker: Is It Worth the Hype?,"Testing the Keurig K-Elite was an enlightening experience for someone like me, who needs their daily caffeine fix to roll through the morning chaos. This coffee maker isn‚Äôt just a kitchen appliance; it‚Äôs a highly customizable brew station for when you want simplicity without sacrificing flavor. The Keurig K-Elite, with its striking brushed silver finish and intuitive design, seemed like a great match for my on-the-go lifestyle and my partner‚Äôs love for an afternoon iced coffee. But as always, nothing‚Äôs perfect.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed silver finish and sleek, modern design of this coffee maker make it a beautiful addition to any countertop. It blends aesthetics with practicality quite well, staying compact without feeling cramped. Measuring around 9.9 inches deep, 12.7 inches wide, and 13.1 inches tall, its size is manageable even for smaller kitchens. While it feels sturdy and well-constructed, the eight-pound weight makes it easy to reposition when necessary. The buttons for various settings, such as brew strength and cup sizes, are placed conveniently on the top, ensuring quick access while navigating through my morning fog.  

**Customization Features**  
Having five cup size options (from 4 to 12 ounces) didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal initially until I noticed how much flexibility it provided. For an average morning, I stick with the 8-ounce size, but it‚Äôs a bonus when hosting friends; each person gets to pick their brew size without wasting coffee. The temperature control was particularly noteworthy. I could adjust the temperature between 187¬∞F and 192¬∞F, and it genuinely made a difference in how some blends revealed their richer flavors. For iced coffee fans like my partner, the ""Iced"" setting brews hot over ice without watering down the bold taste. That has been a hit in our household during the summer months.  

[Check Keurig K-Elite price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b0788f3r8x/)

**Brewing Performance**  
The high-altitude setting surprised me at first. Since I live in a mountainous area, I‚Äôve encountered issues with other machines malfunctioning due to pressure interference. This feature resolved that concern entirely; nothing leaked, and the brewing was seamless. The Strong Brew function, which intensifies flavor, turns out great for those days when I really need a caffeine punch. I tested this setting with both K-Cups and my own ground coffee using the reusable coffee filter (sold separately), and both versions came out consistently strong. For fans of soups or oatmeal, the hot water on demand button has been especially convenient, although I admittedly use it less often.  

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating the Keurig K-Elite feels straightforward, even during groggy mornings. I found the brewer maintenance reminder particularly handy. It alerts you when descaling is needed, helping save me from the guessing game and keeping the coffee tasting as good as possible. Filling up the large 75-ounce removable water reservoir was effortless. This tank size significantly reduces the frequency of refills, especially for someone like me, who goes through multiple cups daily. The removable drip tray is another thoughtful feature, especially since it accommodates taller travel mugs, saving me the trouble of juggling coffee spills during my commute. However, cleaning it after an accidental spill was occasionally tedious, as liquid sometimes managed to seep into those hard-to-reach edges.  

**Advantages**  
- Sleek, modern brushed silver appearance that complements kitchen decor.  
- Offers a variety of customizable options like temperature control and brew strength.  
- Five cup sizes cater to individual preferences.  
- Large water reservoir reduces the need for constant refilling.  
- Features like the Iced setting and Strong Brew button add versatility.  

**Caveats**  
- The reusable coffee filter is sold separately, adding extra cost.  
- Cleaning the drip tray can be cumbersome after spills.  
- The machine's buttons collect coffee dust over time, requiring occasional deep-cleaning.  

**Competing Products**  
Coffee enthusiasts might compare the Keurig K-Elite to the Nespresso VertuoPlus or the Cuisinart SS-10. The Nespresso offers superior espresso options and a sleeker design, but it lacks the iced coffee feature and flexibility with ground coffee. The Cuisinart SS-10 allows for larger brews and slightly better temperature consistency but misses out on the polished aesthetics and compactness of the Keurig K-Elite. For those prioritizing customization and variety, this Keurig model offers a better overall balance, though espresso drinkers might find the Nespresso lineup more fitting.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
Initially, I was hesitant about the investment in this coffee maker, particularly because you have to buy pods and, if desired, the reusable filter separately. Over time, though, the convenience of brewing just the amount needed and the energy efficiency make up for these extra purchases. Compared to other premium single-serve machines, the features included here more than justify the price. It‚Äôs not the cheapest option on the market, but it doesn‚Äôt come across as overly expensive for what you‚Äôre getting.

Think rolling hills, small-town charm, and enough good food and wine to keep you happy for days. We put together a 3-day itinerary that hits all the highlights - perfect for a weekend getaway.¬†

**Day 1: Sunrise hikes & small-town vibes**¬†

* Start with a sunrise hike at Enchanted Rock State Natural Area. Yes, it‚Äôs early but trust us, the views are totally worth it.¬†

* Head to Fredericksburg, a town bursting with German heritage. Stroll down Main Street, pop into antique shops and grab a pastry from a local bakery.¬†

* Hit up Woerner Warehouse Caf√©. Afterward, dive into local history at the Pioneer Museum, or if you're a history buff, the National Museum of the Pacific War is a must-see ‚Äì Fleet Admiral Nimitz grew up right here.¬†

**Day 2: Waterfalls, wildlife & wine**¬†

* Grab breakfast at Caliche Coffee Bar before heading to Pedernales Falls State Park. Explore the scenic trails and enjoy the Blanco River.¬†

* Drive to the artsy town of Wimberley. But first, make a pit stop at The Shady Llama for a Cubano sandwich and a cold one ‚Äì you might even make some new furry friends (think llamas and mini donkeys).¬†

* Cool off with a refreshing dip at Blue Hole Regional Park. Just a heads up, you'll need reservations between May 1st and Labor Day.¬†

* Back in Fredericksburg, treat yourself to some authentic German cuisine. We've heard amazing things about the duck schnitzel at Otto's German Bistro.¬†

**Day 3: Wine country & live music**¬†

* Spend your Sunday unwinding among the vineyards along Highway 290. William Chris Vineyards is a fantastic choice for a relaxed wine tasting and even a picnic lunch.¬†

* End your trip with a truly Texan experience in Luckenbach. This historic trading post is famous for its country music roots. Catch some live music, grab a drink, and soak in the legendary atmosphere.¬†

* If you're heading back towards Austin, do yourself a favor and make a pitstop at The Salt Lick BBQ in Driftwood for some mouth-watering brisket or ribs. You won't regret it!¬†

Texas Hill Country is one of those places that sneaks up on you‚Äîin the best way. Chill, scenic, and full of character. Anyone else been? Got a favorite stop we missed?¬†

Living in a small apartment means every inch of countertop space matters. The Hamilton Beach 46111 Drip Coffee Maker fits perfectly into my tiny kitchen, tucking neatly under the cabinets. Its compact size of 8.1 x 5.8 x 10.3 inches makes it ideal for cramped spaces where every square inch counts. This compactness really appealed to me since my kitchen feels like a game of Tetris most days! The sleek black and stainless steel exterior added a modern touch that seamlessly blended with my other appliances. This space-saver doesn't skimp on style, which is always a plus when you want functional elegance.

**Performance Worth Mentioning**  
Making a pot of coffee with this machine has been an enjoyable part of my daily routine. As someone who needs coffee to even think about starting their day, I loved that it brews up to five cups. Five cups sound like a lot, but it's surprisingly just the right amount for one person's daily dose. The AutoPause and Pour function is genius ‚Äî I could grab a cup mid-brew without coffee spilling everywhere (trust me, I tested it multiple times because impatience is my specialty). The coffee strength felt exactly like the kind of bold wake-up call I appreciate.

[Check Hamilton Beach 46111 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b082ls88wn/)  

**Ease of Use with Thoughtful Features**  
This coffee machine‚Äôs FrontFill design makes adding water and coffee grounds easier than I expected. Filling it up felt effortless, especially in a kitchen where moving appliances around is a hassle. Not only does the design reduce messes on the counter, but it also eliminates the struggle of pulling the machine out from under low cabinets. The programmable clock was another feature I tested thoroughly. Setting it to brew before I even woke up meant no early-morning fumbling with buttons while half-asleep. It definitely earns points for convenience!

**Positives**  
- Compact and stylish design fits small kitchens comfortably.  
- Intuitive FrontFill water reservoir makes refilling easy.  
- AutoPause & Pour feature prevents spills during brewing.  
- Programmable clock ensures morning coffee readiness.  

**Areas of Concern**  
While this machine won me over in many ways, there are a couple of things to consider:  

- The brew basket uses paper filters, and not everyone enjoys having to stock them.  
- It‚Äôs not ideal for larger households since the max brew is five cups.  
- The carafe is glass, which feels more prone to breaking compared to thermal options.  

**Programming to Perfection**  
Testing the timer and programmability of the machine was easily my favorite part. I was able to set it up to 24 hours in advance, which turned my mornings into a no-effort coffee dream. The button interface felt straightforward, and I loved the tactile feel of pressing them. Waking up to the rich aroma of fresh coffee gave my mornings a boost. No need for multiple alarms when I know coffee is already brewing in the corner.

**Product Comparisons**  
Comparing this coffee maker to some competitors like the Mr. Coffee 12-Cup Maker and the small Keurig K-Compact, differences started to stand out. The Keurig has the convenience of pods, but they can feel wasteful compared to using ground coffee here. The Mr. Coffee model accommodates larger households with more capacity but loses major points for lacking programmable features in this price range. The Hamilton Beach machine strikes a nice balance between price, functionality, and space-saving design.

**True Value**  
Does it deliver value for its cost? For anyone in a smaller living space or those simply wanting a compact, efficient option, it absolutely checks most boxes. You pay for simplicity paired with thoughtful features, and for me, that feels like money well spent. Budget-conscious buyers will definitely find utility here without having to overextend their wallets.

1me2736,https://www.reddit.com/r/UsedAndRated/comments/1me2736/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_is/,Reveal If the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker is Keurig K1500,"The Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker has been on my countertop for a few weeks, and I have to say, this single-serve brewer knows how to make mornings easier. Designed with the busy individual or small office in mind, the Keurig K1500 offers convenience, versatility, and reliability. Equipped with a 96 oz water reservoir and the ability to brew four different cup sizes, this is not just any coffee maker; it‚Äôs a workhorse that simplifies caffeine-filled routines. While it delivers on its promise of convenience, there are some quirks to note, but they don't entirely detract from the overall experience.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Keurig K1500 strikes that sweet spot between functionality and aesthetics. Its compact size, measuring 12.4"" x 10.3"" x 12.1"", makes it an ideal fit for smaller kitchens or office spaces. It feels solidly built, and the black finish lends a professional look. The water reservoir is notably large, reducing the need for frequent refills, a detail I found rewarding during weeks of busy mornings. The durable handle on the reservoir also made carrying and cleaning it hassle-free. While the buttons for size and strength adjustments are intuitive, I wished for a slightly larger display or labels that were a tad easier to read in dimmer lighting.

**Brewing Performance**  
When it comes to performance, this coffee machine doesn't disappoint. The Keurig K1500 brews four cup sizes‚Äî6, 8, 10, and 12 ounces‚Äîat the press of a button. I tested all the sizes, and each cup brewed consistently with no drips or spills. The standout feature for me was the STRONG button, which delivers bolder and richer flavors. Using this for a dark roast coffee pod created a punchy brew that gave me just the kick I needed to tackle the day ahead. It‚Äôs quick too; it takes less than a minute to go from pod placement to that first sip. However, it struggles a bit with some non-Keurig cup brands, which may be a limitation for those who enjoy third-party pods.

**Key Benefits**  
- The 96 oz water tank, coupled with a durable handle, saves time by reducing refill needs.  
- Quiet Brew Technology ensures minimal noise, useful if you're brewing early in an office or shared space.  
- STRONG button elevates the flavor depth, particularly appreciated for darker roasts.  
- Brew options include four distinct cup sizes to accommodate different preferences.  

Check [Keurig K1500 Coffee Maker] price on Amazon.

**Features Tailored to Small Offices or Homes**  
This machine seems purpose-built for settings like small businesses or shared kitchens. The large reservoir means it caters effortlessly to multiple users throughout the day without requiring constant water refills. Quiet Brew Technology was a huge plus in my household; the mornings are chaotic enough without the sharp grumble of an especially noisy brewer. It‚Äôs a feature I didn‚Äôt expect to appreciate as much as I do. However, as much as the design suits communal use, I learned the hard way that the drip tray fills rather quickly when multiple cups are brewed consecutively. Cleaning it becomes an essential upkeep task over time.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- Limited compatibility with some non-Keurig pods, which might frustrate adventurous coffee drinkers.  
- The drip tray can fill up faster than anticipated, requiring frequent maintenance.  

**Competing Brands**  
Compared to its competitors like the Nespresso Vertuo or Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Keurig K1500 performs well but doesn't entirely overtake them. The Nespresso's foam-rich crema on espresso pods outshines Keurig‚Äôs standard drip brews, but it lacks the large reservoir capacity the K1500 offers. Similarly, while the FlexBrew provides dual carafe and single-serve capability, its brewing process is comparatively slower. The Keurig carves its niche with volume and seamless brewing operation, which remain its strongest selling points.  

**Cost Efficiency**  
As someone balancing quality features and affordability, I see the K1500 delivering reasonable value. Features like the STRONG brew functionality and massive reservoir make it a versatile choice for its price range. However, potential buyers should consider the ongoing cost of brand-specific pods. This machine truly shines if you're committed to the convenience of Keurig-style brewing and don‚Äôt mind staying within its ecosystem of pods.

The issue is that my worms all die within a month. 
- I made sure to start with a good mixture of soil, shredded cardboard, some coffee grounds (potentially could've been going bad), and green leaves with a 7:3 ratio. 
- I left few food scraps around the bins so they'd be more willing to explore.
- I misted the mixture so it's slightly moist and mixed it around. Topped it with a dry piece of cardboard to encourage them to dig deeper.
- I left it alone for 2 weeks to not disturb the worms.

I would leave this on the balcony but would immediately see flies within the next 2 weeks of setting up, and all of a sudden I stop seeing the worms and it's area is swarmed with flies.

I drank tea and coffee daily for about 20 years. I‚Äôm now about 6 months caffeine free. I tapered down by quitting coffee entirely, then cutting down from unlimited cups of black tea anytime, to 4 cups, to only drinking tea in the morning, then only 2 cups of black tea, then I replaced the black tea with green tea, then decaf green tea. I now occasionally drink decaf green tea, decaf coffee, and I‚Äôve probably had 2 cups of black tea in the last 6 months. Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, insomnia, and fatigue. 

The biggest benefits are I no longer feel crippling anxiety. I was previously diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Not once did a psychiatrist or doctor recommend cutting out caffeine. I also fall asleep way easier, if I want to go to sleep I just go to bed and meditate, I can fall asleep in a normal timeframe now. Again no doctor ever said I should quit caffeine for my insomnia. For anxiety and insomnia I‚Äôve been prescribed benzodiazepines and z-drugs but it‚Äôs totally not necessary. 

Waking up is easier in the sense that I‚Äôm not tired until I drink caffeine. I still wake up feeling slightly groggy but it goes away on its own. Coffee or tea are not needed.  

The biggest drawback is I‚Äôm now highly sensitive to the caffeine and other compounds in dark chocolate to the point that eating 1-2 squares of very dark chocolate will give me physical symptoms of anxiety. It‚Äôs better not to mention this to people though because people roll their eyes or think I‚Äôm being dramatic. Actually, now I‚Äôm nicotine and caffeine free, I‚Äôm very in tune with my body now and how stimulants affect it. 

I‚Äôm also happy to occasionally drink green or black tea, but I don‚Äôt make a habit of it. If I have to travel or I just feel like it. Coffee is too strong and gives me anxiety. It‚Äôs important to me that I do not get dependent on caffeine again, so I don‚Äôt do this often.

1me25o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_stuyou720/comments/1me25o0/brighton_uni_life/,Brighton Uni life,"If you‚Äôre heading to university in Brighton ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs the University of Sussex, University of Brighton, BIMM, or somewhere else ‚Äî you‚Äôre in for something special.

Brighton isn‚Äôt just a city. It‚Äôs a mood.

Sunshine, sea air, quirky streets, a massive student population, and a culture of inclusivity make it one of the best student cities in the UK. But what‚Äôs it actually like to live here as a student? Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the good, the unexpected, and what to know before you move.

üß≠ The Vibe: Creative, Coastal, and Unapologetically Brighton

Brighton is famously open-minded, progressive, and full of personality. Think vintage shops, independent coffee spots, vegan bakeries, indie cinemas, and drag brunches all within walking distance.

Don‚Äôt be surprised if your flatmate runs a DJ night, your coursemate‚Äôs in a punk band, and your neighbor has a full-time hula-hooping side hustle.

üéì The Uni Split: City vs Campus

* University of Sussex: Based out at Falmer in a green, hilly campus that feels like a little village of its own. It‚Äôs quiet and calm, but just 15‚Äì20 minutes from the city centre by bus or train.
* University of Brighton: Multiple campuses ‚Äî some city-based (like Moulsecoomb and Grand Parade), so you‚Äôll feel more plugged into Brighton life from day one.

Both unis have huge student populations, great student unions, and active societies.

üçî Student Essentials: Food, Coffee, and Nights Out

* Best coffee: Pelicano, Twin Pines, and Presuming Ed‚Äôs are top picks.
* Cheap eats: Unithai, Smorl‚Äôs vegan falafel bar, or BHL Caf√© for bang-for-your-buck food.
* Nights out: PRYZM is the big name, but Concorde 2, Patterns, Green Door Store, and Volks are where you‚Äôll find indie nights, house, techno, and live music.
* Pubs with a student vibe: The Druids Arms (Hanover), The Gladstone, or The World‚Äôs End for arcade games and group hangs.

üèò Where Students Actually Live

Most students move out of halls after first year into shared houses ‚Äî usually in:

* Lewes Road: Brighton‚Äôs student backbone. Super convenient, full of buses, pubs, takeaways, and students everywhere.
* Elm Grove / Hanover: Slightly more residential but still buzzing. Think street parties, corner shops, and classic Brighton terraces.
* Moulsecoomb / Bevendean: Good value, popular with Brighton Uni students, slightly hillier but still well-connected.

üåä Free Time? You‚Äôve Got Options

* Hit the beach. Even in winter, it‚Äôs beautiful.
* Take the bus to the South Downs for a countryside break.
* Browse the North Laine for vintage, vinyl, and record stores.
* Go paddleboarding. Or just sunbathe and watch others do it.

üîë What About Housing?

This part can be a bit of a stress-fest if you don‚Äôt get ahead. Competition for good student housing in Brighton is real ‚Äî especially for decent HMOs (shared houses) with good landlords.

That‚Äôs exactly why we started Joint Living.

We‚Äôre a Brighton-based student letting agent, and we do things differently:

* We own every property we let. No third-party landlords, no outsourcing.
* Every student gets their own contract (AST) ‚Äî so no chasing housemates for rent.
* All bills included. No nasty surprises.
* In-house maintenance and a proper student community.
* Locations where students actually want to live: Lewes Road, Elm Grove, Preston Circus, and more.

We‚Äôre here to make the student housing experience simpler, safer, and way more student-friendly.

How do I craft a response?,"As a long time lurker and anti-MLM fiend, I‚Äôve read about a thousand stories of encounters. I‚Äôve always hoped that it would never happen to me because Christ I cannot handle the awkwardness, but it did and it just broke my heart for the girl who did it. Author‚Äôs note: F*** MLMS, DOUBLE F*** AMWAY

So a few weeks ago I was out shopping and this young woman around my age approached me. We chatted for a bit just about my hair and tattoos, then how we both have a history of dance, and then to her ‚Äúcareer in entrepreneurship.‚Äù Following the entrepreneurship point, she started talking about her ‚Äúmentors‚Äù (*cough cough* upline). Right then, my ears twitched like a dog‚Äôs nose and I knew what I was in for, but I‚Äôm terrible at saying no when I feel backed into a corner so I just gave her my number to end that particular interaction.

Texts followed over the next few weeks asking me to go out for coffee. Whenever I would give her a reluctant ‚Äúsure let‚Äôs do it sometime‚Äù she would mention how she could bring her husband so he and my boyfriend could meet and talk about ‚Äúentrepreneurship‚Äù (biggest eye roll, especially as she knows my boyfriend wants to do law.) I had a feeling this would be a pitch, specifically an Amway pitch, but I‚Äôm the kind of person to buy five boxes of Girl Scout cookies when I have ten at home because I just cannot say no to folks I feel bad for‚Ä¶so I went.

We sit down, chat about whatever, and she starts giving me crumbs of her story. Basically, she got married quite young (she‚Äôs still quite young, but got married virtually out the gate from college). Anyways, she dreamed of a career in entertainment and was a phenomenal dancer, so she wanted to drop everything and pursue her dreams in LA which is on the other end of the country. Her husband said no over and over again after she begged him to try it for just a year. Eventually she was convinced out of it because they were low on cash and it wasn‚Äôt something they could feasibly do. So naturally, they tried a dozen and a half ‚Äòget rich quicks‚Äô with no luck (courses, life insurance schemes, etc). While down on her luck and out of reach from her dreams, she and her husband were approached by some ‚Äòmentors‚Äô (üö©) at church. They sold her the ‚Äúwe retired at 26 and are helping others with our e-commerce mentorship!!‚Äù Bullshit and she bought it, now trying to sell it off to others. When I outright said ‚Äúpyramid schemes are dangerous and I don‚Äôt participate‚Äù she even told me that her mentors gave her the ‚Äúthis is not a pyramid scheme speech‚Äù and she BOUGHT IT. I thought that we all understood that if it walks like a pyramid and talks like a pyramid‚Ä¶you should run for the fucking hills, but I guess not. Also, Amway was never explicitly mentioned, though I squeezed the term ‚Äúmlm‚Äù out of her eventually and let‚Äôs be real: we all know the Amway pitch by now.

She tried to peddle to me as ‚Äúgiving me financial freedom‚Äù and the ability to travel. I basically told her to fuck off and that I have major goals in my career in academia that I will not compromise my joining a pyramid scheme (said politely). 

Besides the fact that this was predatory and pissed me off, it honestly just made me very sad. Prior to her big pitch, she was telling her about how I and my long term partner are thinking about moving abroad for a year to pursue advanced degrees and see more of the world. I told her about how I‚Äôm pursuing a career in journalism and although I‚Äôm still in undergrad, it‚Äôs going really well. When I spoke about this and how I have all of these big goals that I keep reaching, I saw the light crack behind her eyes. It was so clear to her what she wanted, but she gave it up. Instead of cracking down and making it happen, she fell into this awful, predatorial trap. When I asked her what she and her husband plan on doing independently as entrepreneurs, she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just this, this is how we are going to build generational wealth.‚Äù She‚Äôs so young and has such big dreams, but she‚Äôs selling her soul to a ruthless scam while her dreams are still out there waiting to be realized.

Anyways, I apologize for waxing poetic. This whole interaction just made me think about how privileged I am to be able to pursue my dreams and that I am educated in MLMs and how destructive they are. I can imagine how easy it can be to believe such a pitch when you‚Äôre down on your luck or unaware of how such scams operate. 

I‚Äôd like to reach back out, specifically to make sure that I didn‚Äôt offend her too much, but also to double down on how much I do not want to do this. Also, is it even worth telling her to get out? With how fucking culty Amway in particular is I don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs worth the effort.",11,1753969689.0,antiMLM,7,1.0,False

First, I see a lot of incongruousness between the aesthetic she wants to project and her actual (filmed/shared) daily life. This part might sound a little snobby, but I am just trying to make a point, not try to come off as more cultured. Example 1: She took a trip to Europe as part of a group tour rather than carefully research a couple of destinations and really explore them and effectively fold them into her brand. Example 2: She makes instant oatmeal from a packet rather than cooking oatmeal on the stove and personalizing the mix-ins. Example 3: She fills her coffee with Coffee Mate instead of a trendy nut-based (or whatever) creamer. Example 4: She buys clothes new instead of thrifting high-end brands that are all over L.A. (such as OZMA or Doen.) All of these, and of course many more examples, work against the aesthetic she is trying to cultivate on her channel. The first time I saw her make instant oatmeal, I was like... what? OK... I guess she is busy. Then she kept doing it... so strange imo if you are 1) working from home and 2) trying to ""romanticize"" life.

So, that brings me to missed opportunities. I just think that if she were a smart business person, she would have a better grasp on the fantasy she is trying to sell. For example, since she loves this ugly cursive font she is always using, why doesn't she learn a little about typography and collaborate to produce her own signature font that she could then sell somehow? (Haha I am not an expert in these things, I just imagine it's something people can do.)

I see people here saying all the time that she ""misses the mark,"" so I guess that's what I'm picking up on in this post. It is also for me a lack of taste and an extreme deficit in curiosity. What do you all think??",9,1753969643.0,XOMaCennaUnfiltered,2,1.0,False
1me21nr,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1me21nr/dialing_in_help_needed/,Dialing in help needed,"I‚Äôve been having difficulty dialing in with this coffee I recently got.

I‚Äôve had the espresso bar since 5 years now; and I usually can dial in new beans in a couple of trial shots.

I have the GCP with PID, 9-bar pressure mod and use a non-pressurised basket. With a Mignon Specialita grinder.

Typically I stick to an 18g dose; and work with my grind size, temperature and shot-time to get what I find optimal.

These new beans are super tricky ‚Äî I almost had to dial in daily‚Ä¶and the slightest difference in grind size led to a bit difference in shot-time. Sometimes there‚Äôs sputtering even after very careful puck-prep (WDT + pressurised tamper)

Today when I‚Äôm almost done with the coffee, I tried a larger dose for the heck of it (yesterday again the shot was too quick; even though I use the coffee daily). 

So in went about 18.5g, and the overall shot flow was so much smoother. It was still quick, but it was as expected. I think I have some more coffee and should be able to try one more 19g shot. 

My brain is telling me that there‚Äôs some fluid mechanics thing that‚Äôs working better with the extra height that‚Äôs achieved with a larger dose? Tell me I‚Äôm overthinking this; or if you‚Äôve experienced something similar. Maybe I need to learn something about doses ‚Äî point me in the right direction. 

TIA!

1me21jq,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1me21jq/bisalp_it_is_done/,[Bisalp] It is done!,"I (32F) had my laparoscopic bilateral salpingectomy yesterday, and I'm so happy about it! The worst part was getting the IV needle placed, since I have an intense phobia of needles (specifically ones that have to go into a vein). But once that was over with and the wrap was put over it so I couldn't see it in my hand, I was all good! I had to get to the hospital at 5:30am with the surgery being scheduled at 7. I was home by 9:30, and that includes making a pharmacy stop. 

My boyfriend was my driver and support person, and then spent most of the day with me at my apartment afterwards, helping me by taking care of food and tasks that involved bending over and stuff that I couldn't do. 

The next morning, I am wishing I'd gotten miralax üòÖ I'm hoping that when I have my morning coffee, it'll help move things along like it normally does, at least a little bit. Urinating is still just as easy as it was before though. 

Overall, I feel good. Just sore and tired. I went on a walk with my boyfriend last night to help get the gas from the surgery that's causing pain in my shoulders to absorb quicker. There's still pain there, but I'll keep going on walks to help it pass more. 

One thing that's bothering me is the incision in my belly button. My stomach has loose skin from weight loss, so that incision gets moved around a lot just by the tissue being all jiggly while I walk around, and if I lay on my side I have to hold it to provide support so gravity doesn't pull on the loose skin. Anyone have ideas on providing better support for that area, that isn't holding it with my hand all the time? I'm worried about all the movement making it more susceptible to tearing open and/or getting infected. The other two incisions are fine since they're not in loose skin areas. 

Also I highly recommend Dr. Steven J Adams at OBGYN Associates of Idaho Falls. At my consult a month ago, he didn't make me debate or justify my decision to be sterilized. He'd already decided he was going to do my surgery for me before we'd even met, when he got my referral from my GP. He was required to give a spiel about how it's permanent and blah blah blah, but it was just that. ",5,1753969634.0,childfree,1,1.0,False

1me213h,https://v.redd.it/x70oy4i4s7gf1,Upgrading to a 7x14 from a 6x12(for sale),"The time has come, after two years, I've decided to sell my fully loaded 6x12, and build a 7x14. I run a remote remodeling business out of my trailer, and need a bit more space.

Trailer is located in Indiana.

If anyone is truly interested in getting into a cargo camper, and want to skip ""a few steps"".. My 2023 Discovey Rover ET 6x12 is for sale.

Once I get the new trailer, I'll also do a build out thread of it on here. 

Items that will 100% stay in camper. 8,000btu Air conditioner, two burner gas stove with tank, all cabinets, 1000w of solar panels and wires, diesel heater, Dometic cooler, maxairr 4 speed reversible fan, 8'awning,  3x40 gallon totes that fit under the bed. Trailer is fully wired for 120v and 12v.

Optional: four
1080p security camera system and two backup camera system with wireless connection to tow vehicle.

The main solar system can also be included, but this is an item that can easily be moved to the new build, so no huge discount on any of it... you would just get a known working system that works as intended, with hundreds of dollars of free copper wire. It includes a Renogy 3500w inverter/charger, with 50amp shore power and 25' 50A cord with 30A and 15A adapters, 8x100ah LiTime 12v batteries configured into 48v This system is large enough to run heat/AC for up to 18 hours with zero solar power coming into the system. I lived in this trailer FULL TIME, for seven months in the past year.. so this is a solid solar system, that kept the trailer at 70f 98% of the time. I would guesstimate the solar system was around $3,000 just materials, with lots of free labor, and a few cuss words thrown in for good measure. You can also run the AC around two full nights, with zero sun to recharge. I've also been able to run the AC during the day, 95% off of the sun, so if your already fully recharged, you can easily take a mid day nap, and still have two nights of power. Using 30A of shore power, you can also fully recharge in 4-5 hours, this is also adjustable, so you can slow the shore power charge rate, to use less amps, if you can only find a 15A plug to hookup to. 

FYI our town lost power for a few days, I ran an extension cord to the house refrigerator and deep freezer, and saved all our food.. Everyone else had to throw it away. This can be a massive power backup system for your house as well in emergency's. Change your phones, and be able to cook from the camper. I no longer own a gas powered generator, I sold it after building this solar system. Also gas stations can't sell gas without power. 

One added bonus, when camping in National Parks. Most sites don't have power, and also ban generators. So when you're sipping your fresh morning coffee made in the Keurig coffee maker, you WILL get someone that makes a comment about everyone else sweating all night, while you slept like a baby in 68f temperatures. This right here is one of my favorite memories hitting ten NP's last year. You can be the hero, and offer them a cup of coffee for their suffering. 

Walls and ceiling are 1"" foam, floor has 2"" foam insulation. (Full disclosure, I never got around to putting insulation in the doors, so I saved you a project)

Also has a 8' awning installed on the side door side, so you can have a ""dry"" area outside the door when camping.

You will need to install your own fart free twin mattress, or convert it to a queen size. (I'm willing to do the conversion to queen at material only costs)

The bed has two options, in the video, it's right to left, with a 2' garage area behind it.. however it's now changed to the bed being front to back, without the garage wall.. with the mattress on the same wall as the solar system. Once buyer is on site, I can help you flip the bed the way YOU want before purchase. Width of trailer is 5'9"" so side to side placement sucks with head on one wall, and feet on the other, but I needed the garage space for tool storage.

Desk/table area is a drop down, so you can fold it down when not in use. 

There are currently no windows, due to I wanted it not to look like a camper, however if buyer supply's the windows, I will help install for free (I remodel houses for a living)

This same trailer new is currently $4,300, plus $3,000 in solar, then another 2-3k of small parts, plus free labor.. this trailer has an estimated 15,000 miles on it and lived in for about nine months, so definitely not new, but I did attempt to not beat it to death. The cabinets are showing some wear, due to heavy use.. but they are built out of 3/4 cabinet grade plywood, so you could kick them all day long, and they will not fall apart. Then as seen in video, there are a lot of things screwed to the walls, that I'll take back out.. so the walls will have some holes, that I can caulk.

So then price.. I estimate that I have around 10k total investment, plus lots of labor and planning. I would LIKE to get 8k for the trailer, but I also need it gone. Lots of options for me to move costly items into the new trailer, and can greatly reduce the price. I'm also willing to toss in one full day, modifying the camper to your liking. Windows, cabinets, bed.. whatever you want. 

If buyer wants both camera systems, you will need to pay full replacement cost of $400 for them. Let me know what you want to keep, and we can work out a price.

Batteries, these are also optional, I can easily reduce the price, and move them to the new trailer. We can convert it to a smaller system as well, so you have a working system, but less batteries.. 

FYI power went out in my home town for four days, we just ran an extension cord to the trailer, and plugged the home refrigerator and microwave into the camper. This is a robust system, and having it can offer emergency power for your house. Everyone else in town lost all their food, we lost nothing. This is 9,920Wh of backup emergency power. 

Send me a DM, and this weekend I can clean the trailer 100% out, and get some photos.",2,1753969604.0,cargocamper,2,1.0,False

1me1z0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1me1z0t/delve_into_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_ce251/,Delve Into the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CE251 Review Worth Your Time,"Reviewing the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB was quite the caffeinated journey in itself. As someone who takes their morning coffee ritual seriously, I needed a drip coffee machine capable of delivering both consistency and convenience. This sleek black and stainless steel model offers a promising package, updated with dual brew modes and a 12-cup carafe. Having tested it daily, I'll dive into its key features, merits, and where it falls slightly short.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The minute I unboxed it, I could tell the Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB was a meticulously crafted machine. Its polished stainless-steel touches blend elegantly with a matte black body, making it a stylish addition to any kitchen counter. Measuring roughly 10 inches wide and 15 inches tall, it doesn‚Äôt eat up excessive counter space, which is fantastic for small apartments like mine. The 60-oz. removable water reservoir is super convenient; I love being able to detach and refill it directly at the sink‚Äîit saves a ton of hassle. The glass carafe feels robust, and its ergonomic handle makes pouring seamless. Still, I noticed the warming plate, while great for maintaining coffee temperature, tends to show scratches over time, creating aesthetic imperfections.

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker is about as simple to operate as it gets. The button interface is intuitive, with clear labels and functionalities. Whether setting the 24-hour programmable timer or customizing the brew strength, it's all straightforward. For those of us who barely function pre-caffeine, an easy one-button start for a classic or rich brew is a highlight. Programming it the night before so I can wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee has been a game-changer, especially on busy weekdays. One slight hiccup‚Äîunder low lighting, the controls could be hard to see, as there‚Äôs no backlighting.

**Brewing Performance**  
When it comes to delivering a piping hot, flavorful cup, the Ninja coffee maker doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The advanced boiler ensures optimal brewing temperature, so each cup tastes freshly brewed without being scorching. I tested both the Classic and Rich brew strengths, and, true to Ninja's claim, neither tasted watered down nor overly bitter. Its special small-batch setting works like a charm too; I often prepare just two cups instead of a full pot, with no noticeable dip in quality. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning that brewing a full 12-cup carafe can take a little longer than expected‚Äîit‚Äôs not a dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind during rushed mornings.

[Check Ninja CRT2NJCE251RB price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)

**Favored Features**  
‚Ä¢ The dual brew strength options let you tailor the coffee to your mood or headcount.  
‚Ä¢ Advanced brewing tech ensures maximum flavor extraction without overheating.  
‚Ä¢ Having a programmable delay timer is incredibly convenient.  
‚Ä¢ Removable water reservoir simplifies refilling and cleaning.  

**Flaws**  
Though the machine checks most of the boxes for a daily coffee lover, some aspects could be refined.  
‚Ä¢ Visible scratches on the warming plate after regular use detract from its premium look.  
‚Ä¢ The lack of backlighting on the button panel is inconvenient in dimly lit spaces.  
‚Ä¢ Brewing a full carafe could be faster.  

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing it to rivals like the Cuisinart DCC-3200, the Ninja coffee maker holds its own in terms of performance but has a leg up when it comes to ease of use, thanks to its detachable water reservoir. The Cuisinart model offers more advanced settings but has a steeper learning curve for casual users. Meanwhile, the Keurig K-Duo Plus provides enhanced convenience with its pod compatibility but feels less cost-efficient for those sticking to ground coffee. Between them, the Ninja boasts excellent versatility, particularly for someone looking for no-frills drip brewing at its best.

**True Value**  
Pricing plays a big role in deciding whether to pick up this coffee brewer. Given its updated features, durability, and ease of maintenance, it sits in a highly competitive sweet spot. For a renewed product, it‚Äôs priced attractively while maintaining an almost new-like experience, thanks to Amazon Renewed's rigorous inspection process. Comparing its cost to the features offered, you‚Äôd be hard-pressed to find a better prospect for households or offices that see heavy coffee consumption. The added benefit of small-batch brewing elevates its financial worth even more.

**quicktouch Programming**

Many Black and Decker coffee makers feature QuickTouch programming, which allows users to easily set the automatic brewing time.

The one-touch programming ensures ease of use, even for those who are not technologically inclined. This feature consistently receives positive feedback for its simplicity and reliability.

**Duralife Glass Carafe**

Black and Decker coffee makers are often paired with a Duralife glass carafe. This carafe is designed to be durable and resistant to thermal shock. Duralife glass is engineered to withstand the rapid temperature changes associated with brewing and keeping coffee warm. The carafe also features easy-to-read measurement markings, making it simple to accurately fill the water reservoir.

**Sneak-A-Cup Feature**

The Sneak-A-Cup feature allows you to pour a cup of coffee mid-brew without making a mess.This function temporarily stops the brewing cycle when the carafe is removed, preventing drips onto the hot plate. This is a convenient option for impatient coffee drinkers who can't wait for the entire pot to finish brewing. The feature is a practical addition that minimizes spills and interruptions.

**Space-Saving Design**

Recognizing the value of countertop space, many Black and Decker coffee makers are designed to be compact. These models are ideal for small kitchens, apartments, or dorm rooms where space is limited. Despite their smaller footprint, these coffee makers retain their brewing capacity and core functionalities. The slim design ensures the coffee maker doesn't dominate your countertop.

**Automatic Shutoff**

for safety and energy conservation, most Black and Decker coffee makers include an automatic shutoff feature. This feature automatically turns off the coffee maker after a set period, typically two hours. This prevents the unit from overheating and reduces the risk of fire hazards.The automatic shutoff provides peace of mind and contributes to responsible energy consumption.

**Easy-Clean Functionality**

Maintaining your coffee maker is crucial for optimal performance and longevity. Black and Decker coffee makers feature removable filter baskets and dishwasher-safe carafes for easy cleaning. The removable parts greatly simplify the cleaning process and help prevent the buildup of coffee residue.

The Voyager works great with the iPad Air. I‚Äôve got a ton of custom hardware keybindings, and they all work. 

I go back and forth over whether I should have gotten the larger iPad Air, but when I need to see a bunch of stuff on the screen at once the split screen feature is usually sufficient. There‚Äôs USB-C splitter lets me use the keyboard and another accessory (power or mic) at once.

Getting the cellular internet on the iPad seemed profligate at the time, but it sure is nice.

For development I mostly use Claude Code. I‚Äôm running Claude Code on my Mac Mini at home and connecting via SSH over Tailscale. I‚Äôm running it inside tmux, so if I kick off a long running job I can close up the iPad and do something else without fear of interrupting it. My Mac Mini‚Äôs files are synced to my main dev computer over a Synology NAS.

The Sennheiser USB lavalier is great for talking to AI apps (always a better interface than typing), although voice-to-text doesn‚Äôt work with Termius on the iPad. I may explore whether it works with other terminal apps. If I have a lot to say to Claude Code, I‚Äôll split screen to a text editor and cmd-a, cmd-c, cmd-tab, cmd-v. After I post this I‚Äôll be configuring my Voyager to do that in one keystroke.

1me1ogy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1me1ogy/could_the_presto_6cup_stainlesssteel_coffee/,Could the Presto 6-Cup Stainless-Steel Coffee Percolator Brew Your Perfect Morning Coffee? Review,"**First Impressions of the Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator**  

I've been putting the Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator to the test for the past couple of weeks, and let me just say, this stainless-steel beauty truly stands out in the kitchen. As someone who appreciates a good cup of coffee to kickstart the day, I was intrigued by its promise to brew 2 to 6 cups of strong, hot coffee in a compact yet sturdy form. The polished exterior of the percolator gives a sleek, retro vibe that‚Äôs hard to resist, but there‚Äôs definitely more to it than meets the eye.

**Design and Build Quality**  

The brushed stainless steel looks as good as it sounds‚Äîit‚Äôs timeless, durable, and fits perfectly in a modern or classic kitchen setting. The percolator measures about 7.5 inches wide, 4 inches deep, and 10 inches tall. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit on crowded countertops but not so small that it feels flimsy. I‚Äôve noticed that the cool-touch knob and handle really come in handy, especially during hurried mornings when I'm pouring that first cup. Plus, the detachable cord makes storage a breeze.  

[Ready to snag Presto 2822 Coffee Percolator? See Amazon‚Äôs price here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b002lvuik8/)  

**Brewing Performance**  

The 500-watt performance of this coffee percolator is quite impressive. It doesn‚Äôt take an unreasonable amount of time to brew coffee‚Äîwithin minutes, you‚Äôre greeted with the familiar bubbling and aromatic scent of coffee brewing. It does circulate hot water through the grounds to achieve a strong flavor profile, hitting that sweet spot between boldness and smoothness.  

I tested it using both pre-ground coffee and freshly ground beans, and the results were consistently good‚Äîprovided the grind size was appropriate. Bear in mind, if the grind is too coarse or tamped too lightly, the pressure can falter, and the result may not be up to expectations. The built-in indicator light is super helpful; it lets me know when the coffee is ready to serve. The automatic keep-warm feature is fantastic for someone like me who often gets side-tracked during the morning rush.  

**Advantages**  
- Sleek and durable stainless-steel finish.  
- Brews flavorful coffee with minimal wait time.  
- Easy-to-use detachable cord and cool-touch parts.  
- Pleasant percolating sound adds to the classic coffee-making experience.  

**Usability and Features**  

Operating this coffee percolator takes me back in time‚Äîit‚Äôs manual, straightforward, and honestly refreshing compared to modern button-heavy machines. I like how the drip-free spout prevents messes during pouring, something my old coffee maker failed miserably at. Also, the stay-cool bottom prevents unnecessary heat transfer to countertops, which I appreciate given my limited counter space in a small apartment.  

The reusable filter is another standout feature for me as it saves money compared to disposable filters. Plus, switching to reusable tools feels like a small yet meaningful step toward being environmentally conscious.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The 2-cup minimum can be inconvenient for single servings.  
- Coffee could sometimes overflow if overfilled‚Äîpour carefully!  
- The handle placement, while ergonomic, isn‚Äôt ideal for tight storage solutions.  

**Other Options**  

When compared to its competitors, this is a standout product in the coffee percolator category. I tried an option from Farberware, which had similar features but lacked the sturdy stainless steel build and polished finish of the Presto model. The Hamilton Beach percolator offers slightly larger capacity, but it doesn't heat up quite as quickly nor provide the same aesthetic charm.  

One area where this product surpasses others is with its consistent brewing temperature‚Äîessential for flavor extraction. However, a downside is that some competing models have additional digital settings, while this relies entirely on manual operation. Still, for those who prefer a simple and effective coffee maker, this hits the mark.  

**Value for Money**  

In terms of affordability, this coffee machine balances price with performance well. Its long-lasting stainless steel construction justifies its cost, making it a worthwhile investment. Compared to pod-based coffee makers or advanced drip machines, this percolator feels like a great option for anyone looking to save money while still enjoying a rich, hot coffee experience.

I‚Äôve been interested in the idea of a coffee shop/bakery since I was a teen but assumed it wouldn‚Äôt be a feasible dream. Now that I truly feel like a blank slate, I‚Äôm thinking why not try and make this happen. I worked as a barista in college and now I‚Äôm back at it again as I figure out my next steps.

I‚Äôve just begun to seriously look at this as a possibility, so I‚Äôm very much in the early stages of development. I‚Äôm located in mid-michigan and only know of one coffee truck business in the area (it‚Äôs a franchise) so I‚Äôm hoping that the market for a mobile coffee business is decent. I think there are decent opportunities for events in the summer especially (farmers markets, setting up at businesses, etc) but wonder about what to expect in the colder months. 

As I‚Äôm beginning to make logistical considerations, I‚Äôm looking at having a menu consist of drip/iced coffee, possibly cold brew, lattes, Red Bull mocktails, and tea offerings (matcha, chai, iced, premium tea bags). I‚Äôm thinking keep it simple at first with just hot and iced options, 16 or 20 oz. I‚Äôve got ideas for a set menu with a few house lattes with names that fit my theme, as well as seasonal menu ideas with limited time flavors. One of the considerations that will greatly affect what I‚Äôm able to offer is whether or not I‚Äôll need a commissary kitchen - I‚Äôve been trying to understand the rules around this and having a hard time. For example, I‚Äôd like to have a cold foam option and debating between having a premade type or making in-house, or even as simple as buying premade lemonade vs a concentrate that needs to be mixed with water. I‚Äôm unclear as to what additional rules/certifications I may need in order to make beverages like this. (Plus I‚Äôm interested in offering some type of food- I can make it at home, buy premade- just wanna know what additional steps I‚Äôd need to take)

In terms of equipment, I‚Äôm wondering if people have any suggestions: I‚Äôd have to start from scratch with finding a trailer, probably having to design it to code from scratch (probably not realistically affordable to buy one already loaded), such as water/electric, appliances, counters, etc. Are there reputable places I should look for cheap/used equipment and/or supplies? Any recommendations when it comes to designing/looking for trailers, any considerations to keep in mind?

Any other recommendations/considerations would be helpful! I‚Äôm also wondering the best financial way to go about this. I‚Äôm very fortunate that my partner is able to provide for us on their salary as I have very limited funds with my current pay and quite a bit of medical debt. My plan was to keep researching so I can create a legit business plan breakdown to know how much I need to save/how much I can get a loan for. Are there other funding sources I should look into, like specific grants, etc? ",1,1753968628.0,barista,1,0.99,False

I keep seeing the same question pop up, ‚ÄúHow do I get my business to show up on Google when people search locally?‚Äù So here's a plain-English guide I‚Äôve used to help rank dozens of small business sites (think: plumbers, coffee shops, therapists, consultants, you name it).

Let‚Äôs break it down.

**1. Tell Google You Exist**

First things first: set up your¬†**Google Business Profile (GBP)**. That‚Äôs the thing that shows up on the map when someone types in ‚Äúdog groomer near me‚Äù or whatever.

üîπ Fill it out¬†*completely*: hours, services, phone, photos, the works.  
üîπ Use the exact same¬†**Name, Address, and Phone (NAP)**¬†on your site. Seriously, even small mismatches can mess things up.

**2. Localize Your Website**

You want Google to see that your business and your city go hand in hand.

‚úÖ Drop your city + service in title tags, headers, and your main content.  
Example:¬†*‚ÄúTop-Rated Electrician in Tampa, FL | SparkRight Electric‚Äù*

‚úÖ Embed a Google Map on your Contact page and make your address stupid easy to find.  
‚úÖ Serving multiple towns? Create¬†**dedicated pages**¬†for each one. Don‚Äôt just copy/paste, though‚Äîmake them feel real.

**3. Get Listed in Local Directories (Citations)**

These are things like Yelp, Bing Places, and all those ‚Äúbest of‚Äù sites no one admits to reading.

üóÇ Your info needs to¬†*exactly*¬†match your GBP, no ‚ÄúStreet‚Äù here and ‚ÄúSt.‚Äù there.  
Start with the obvious free listings, then dig into niche directories (like state or city-specific ones).

**4. Earn Reviews (Especially on Google)**

Reviews are basically SEO steroids. No joke.

‚≠ê Ask happy customers to drop a review that casually mentions what you did¬†*and*¬†where.  
Example:¬†**‚ÄúACME Roofing patched our leak in downtown Denver, super fast!‚Äù**

üí¨ Reply to all reviews. Even the awkward ones. Google notices when you‚Äôre active.

Funny story, I had a client who replied to every review with a dad joke . It actually helped their engagement. Go figure.

**5. Build Local Backlinks**

Local links are underrated. One solid backlink from your town‚Äôs newspaper blog can outdo five generic SEO blog links.

üîó Reach out to local bloggers, community calendars, heck, even the PTA.  
üîó Sponsor a local soccer team or a school event, they usually list sponsors on their site. That‚Äôs a legit link.

Even just two or three local links can move the needle. I‚Äôve seen it happen.

**6. Stay Active on Your GBP**

Post something, an offer, a photo, an update, at least every week or two.

üì∏ I mean, don‚Äôt overthink it. Snap a behind-the-scenes pic, post a special, whatever. Just don‚Äôt let your profile sit like a ghost town.

**Quick Tips:**

* Use¬†**Google Search Console**¬†to spy on what local terms are bringing in eyeballs.
* Tools like¬†**BrightLocal**¬†or¬†**Whitespark**¬†help you track your citations and see what your competitors are doing.
* Local SEO isn‚Äôt wizardry. It‚Äôs just¬†**consistency + relevance**. Think ‚Äúdigital housekeeping with a neighborhood twist.‚Äù

Stick with it and you‚Äôll probably start seeing movement in a couple of months. Some of my clients see action in six weeks, others take longer. It really depends on the competition and how ‚Äúdead‚Äù their setup was to begin with.

It‚Äôs like starting a garden after winter. At first, nothing. Then one morning, there's a sprout. You just have to keep watering.

I know this subreddit probably gets plenty of posts asking for help dialing in but I‚Äôm really at my wits end.

I just bought a Breville Barista Pro, Australian Model, with the Baratza Burrs. I‚Äôve been going through nearly half a kilo of beans but have made no progress with dialing it in - worse still, no matter what I do it seems I end up with the same timing despite varying the grind (both the inner and outer burrs) and the dose.

I have been trying to do 18 grams, 36 out but my time has been 14 seconds, wjth what I think is channeling. I tried it with a bottomless portafilter (from Normcore) and despite following puck prep thoroughly, I still see jets of coffee everywhere. It‚Äôs really frustrating and demoralising cleaning up and trying again blindly without knowing what‚Äôs wrong.


I tried using the factory default (inner burr 6 and varying the outer grind setting) to no avail. I‚Äôve tried finer burr settings as per the usual espresso advice of grinding finger, even ending up with inner burr 1 and outer grind 1, and somehow still ending up with a 15-16 second shot. 

This is despite using WDT and the provided tamper. Even using another self leveling tamper doesn‚Äôt seem to help. 

I‚Äôm really at my wits end, and not even sure where to start again to try to even dial in this machine. I use beans roasted 2 weeks ago, and each failed attempt just stings me to think I‚Äôm throwing away some really quality beans. I‚Äôve tried a medium roast, dark roast and still the same disappointment.

No idea why, but I sleep better on couches)

My coffee is a Keurig pod triple run with chocolate protein powder, PB powder, 6 ice cubes, and then unsweetened soy milk to the brim of a 40 ounce tumbler. I usually drink it, then make myself another one at some point throughout the day.

That morning, I didn't feel like drinking it, so I let it sit there, thinking I'd drink it eventually, but I ended up not getting to it until it was too late in the day for coffee. So, like I've done many times before, I just saved it for the next morning.

Today, I woke up like normal and started sipping on my coffee from yesterday. It tasted a little...off? Not bad, but just like a little sour. Soy milk is a recent addition, so I figured having it sit out changed the taste and just drank it anyway. As I was finishing the last of it and letting the coffee machine warm up for another coffee concoction, I opened the tumbler to rinse it before refilling it. Aaaaaaaand my brain stopped working momentarily.

Along the sides of my tumbler were maggots. Not a ton of them. Maybe like ten. No idea how many WERE in them before I started drinking it. No idea how many I ingested. I was frozen in place for a couple seconds, then rinsed and THOROUGHLY clean every nook and cranny of the damn thing.

Fianc√© walks in the room and I tell him what happened. He works in the medical field and I asked if I should induce vomiting, to which he said no, I should be fine. I respond with a ""Well I guess I got more protein than I expected!"" and we both laughed and I made myself another coffee, which I'm currently drinking.

So from now on, if I don't drink my morning coffee, I'm definitely storing it in the fridge.

1me1gxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1me1gxh/the_actpotency_argument/,The Act-Potency Argument,"I tried posting a simplified syllogism of this argument earlier- it did not work. Lesson learned. Below is a longer form version. Mods, this is also lifted from my website hopeandsanity.com, which I can prove I own/am not plagiarizing.

The inferences at the end are not robustly defended, and I don‚Äôt intend them to be; the goal of this argument is to convince you there is a fully actual actualizer.Here goes: 

The first step to understanding this argument is to understand the Aristotelian meanings of ‚Äúpotential‚Äù and ‚Äúactual.‚Äù This is where most of the confusion around this argument comes from. People assume this is referring to some sort of Newtonian potential energy, but it is not. At all. ‚ÄúPotency‚Äù is a shorthand reference to the law of noncontradiction: a cup of coffee which is actually 75¬∞ is ‚Äúpotentially‚Äù 70¬∞ because it cannot actually be 75¬∞ and 70¬∞ at the same time. One might say that the cup is not actually any one temperature, but is the average of many molecules. Sure, but this only pushes the issue down to the molecular level rather than addressing it. The idea of potency and actuality is simply that no being can be in two contradictory states at once.

Even at the furthest reaches of modern science, this idea remains obviously true. Can a particle both be in a state of spontaneous emission and not in a state of spontaneous emission at once? Prior to the Big Bang, when time did not exist, could a wave function both be emitting a particle and not emitting a particle? Could the Big Bang both be happening and not happening at the same time? Obviously, the answer to these is no. This is all that Aristotle claims in drawing the distinction between potency and act.

Now these terms should illuminate the Aristotelian meaning of the word ‚Äúmotion.‚Äù Again, this does not refer to some Newtonian concept of an object literally moving from point A to point B. ‚ÄúMotion‚Äù describes beings going from a state of potency to a state of actuality. That is, the coffee cup moving from cold to hot. Or a subatomic particle going from ‚Äúnot-emitted‚Äù to ‚Äúemitted.‚Äù

With these two simple premises understood, we can understand St. Thomas‚Äôs next point. Nothing can actualize itself, for that would require being in the actual state prior to being in the actual state, which is obviously impossible. Thus, if a being is changing from potential to actual, it can only be by the power of another. The temperature of the coffee changes due to the air, and that air because of solar radiation, and so on. But if all beings required the simultaneous motion of another to precede them, nothing could ever change! Imagine plugging a TV into a power strip, and then that power strip into another, and that into another ‚Äì the TV would never turn on. So how is it that things actually change?

St. Thomas‚Äô answer is a simple distinction: per se and per aliud. When a being has a quality per se, it has it ‚Äúof itself.‚Äù Imagine fire. Despite all of the inputs to a fire not being hot ‚Äì wood, matches, kindling ‚Äì fire is hot. Thus, fire has heat ‚Äúof itself,‚Äù part of its nature. When a being has a quality per aliud, it has it ‚Äúof another.‚Äù So, if I use a fire to heat a pot of water, the water has heat ‚Äúof another.‚Äù St. Thomas uses this principle to answer the problem of infinite regression: one being must have actuality per se, the way fire has heat per se. That is, this being is complete in every conceivable way, with no potency whatsoever. This means infinite power to actualize without requiring a prior actualizer. A ‚Äúfirst mover.‚Äù

Aquinas says that the fully actual being, or ‚Äúfirst mover‚Äù must be God. He proves this in successive chapters, but I will give a brief look into how he does it:
There can only be one fully actual being, for any distinction from pure actuality is potency. A fully actual being cannot be material, because material always has potency ‚Äì so He is immaterial. He must be eternal, for if He wasn‚Äôt, something would have to have moved Him from potential existence to actual existence. He must be perfect ‚Äì that is, lacking in absolutely nothing, for any lack denotes unfulfilled potential. This means He is omnibenevolent, having all that is desirable innately. What is fully actual acts upon others without ever being acted upon, and since that is the principle of all motion, He is all-powerful. He must know all things, for if He did not know something, He would have potential to know it. And so on and so on.",0,1753968224.0,DebateReligion,16,0.33,False

It comes so naturally to me to blame my surrounding for things I did and just don't remember. Even now I'm not entirely convinced. 

Yesterday my glasses were suddenly on the kitchen counter, as if they had teleported there. I had absolutely zero memory of taking them off and placing them there. I asked my boyfriend how long I had not been wearing my glasses and be said I hadn't been ""for a good while"". A few days earlier the same happened to my bracelets, but that felt more like ""I could have done that on autopilot or something"". But my glasses genuinely felt like they suddenly teleported. It felt like time was continuing as normal, like there was no space for me to be missing time. 

This morning I found my decaf coffee powder in one of the kitchen counters. I asked my boyfriend jokingly but slightly defensively why he took it out of my backpack. He said he didn't, they were next to my shoes and on the kitchen counter before that. I insisted that's impossible, they were in my backpack. Then I suddenly remembered also seeing it next to my shoes and assuming my bf must have put it there. 

I feel so defeated. It's such a small thing in the grand scheme of things, but it feels IMPOSSIBLE. Like it can't be.

The crowd wasn't massive, but there were more people than I expected and there was such a lovely vibe. Very diverse demographic, lots of families and kids, and I only had positive interactions with staff and Springbok fans. The majority of the crowd hung around after the game to cheer the players, from their reaction you wouldn't have guessed we lost. The genuine love and appreciation was uplifting and in stark contrast to the jaded negativity I've experienced at some other games where the home team won. R20 tickets (available on Quicket) made it accessible to a wide range of people, and made travel costs easily justifiable. 

One advantage of a smaller crowd is that free, on-site parking was readily available (accessed via Hickory St, note that Cross Blvd and parking is closed for use of event staff and broadcasting vehicles). It was generally well managed. Gates open at 15:00, KO at 17:00. Getting out took some time, but amazingly everyone was considerate (actually allowing other cars to merge) and patient. There was an abundance of traffic police who did a great job. Their presence on the corner of Hickory St and Klipfontein Rd also meant that I would have been perfectly comfortable walking to Lower Klipfontein Rd to catch an Uber at the drop and go area.

Seating is only on the West Stand, so while the sun is up it's relatively warm. As soon as the sun dips behind the East Stand, though, it gets cold quick. Take a cap for the first half and a jacket for the second half.

The music was mostly local and contemporary with no Sweet Caroline, Country Road, or any of the other ancient, overplayed drivel. The gwijo group in attendance were in fine voice and added so much to the overall experience. 

The stadium is in good repair, clean facilities, and easy to navigate. There was limited food and drink (perhaps understandable considering the crowd size), but not exorbitantly priced. Hot dogs and chips; corn cups, popcorn, sweets and cool drinks; and coffee were available from 3 different vendors. Queues were quick. No alcohol on sale might sound like a drawback to some, but I suspect a direct correlation to the distinct (and refreshing) lack of antisocial behaviour. 

To those who might not have many opportunities to visit Athlone and have some apprehension, there's no need. The short shot up Klipfontein Rd from the M5 is fine, and the genial crowd and well resourced security presence made for a very safe atmosphere. 

If you're in or around CT and missed last weekend's game, I would highly recommend you catch it this Saturday's. It's well worth it, and you'll get to give the Springbok Women a proper send-off before they embark on their World Cup journey to England. ",2,1753968165.0,capetown,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm moving to Austin soon for work (remote, but my company requires me to be based here). I‚Äôve been touring apartments like crazy and I‚Äôm honestly overwhelmed.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
	‚Ä¢	1 bed/1 bath
	‚Ä¢	A safe area (this is my #1 priority ‚Äì I‚Äôm a young woman and will be living alone)
	‚Ä¢	Walkability to parks/coffee shops would be amazing since I work from home and want to feel less isolated.
	‚Ä¢	I‚Äôm new to Austin, so I‚Äôm also hoping to be in a place where I can make some friends or at least have some social vibe around.

Where I‚Äôve toured:
	‚Ä¢	Mueller (AMLI on Aldrich, AMLI North)
	‚Ä¢	near Domain area (Mia, Broadstone)
	‚Ä¢	South Lamar (loved the vibe but safety issues scared me)

Currently leaning toward AMLI on Aldrich because I loved the walkability, parks, and vibe in Mueller. But I‚Äôve been reading recent reviews mentioning break-ins, shootings near the HEB, and sketchy people near bus stops. That‚Äôs making me hesitate because I need to feel safe and stable, especially as someone new to the city.

The other option is to go with something in a quieter/sleepier but safer area (like Broadstone/Mia) where I won‚Äôt have walkability but might have more peace of mind.

Questions:
	‚Ä¢	For anyone living in Mueller/AMLI on Aldrich (or nearby): How safe do you actually feel day-to-day? Would you recommend it for a single woman?
	‚Ä¢	Are there any other areas I should be considering that balance safety and some kind of liveliness?
	‚Ä¢	Any advice for someone in my situation who works from home and is new to Austin?

Thanks in advance. I feel super stuck and would love to hear real experiences from people actually living in these areas!

When he asks what took me or teases me about being late, admittedly usually in a good natured way, I get really annoyed about being asked to do this extra task while my hands are already full. Especially since, usually, when I get down there he's looking at his phone (yes, while in the water) so he's literally staring at something that could tell him the time. 

Some days he's running late getting up and then needs me to bring him clothes because he's still in the shower when the nanny arrives (and even if he knows that will likely happen, he never grabs clothes for himself).

He also wants me to check to make sure he's up in the morning (after I've been up at least an hour with the kids), he needs me to remind him to have lunch and call him at the end of the day so he makes it in time for daycare pick up.

The thing is, I don‚Äôt have 10 grand lying around to take Red Hat‚Äôs training courses (the $600 exam I can handle), so I bought a RHEL Udemy course for $20 on sale and just want to start learning and messing around with Red Hat. Does this sound like a viable path for me? How much trouble will I have finding a job with my background assuming I can obtain an RHCSA certification? Am I in over my head without a CS/related degree, or is this something I can brute force my way through teaching myself? Is this field as affected by the not-so-hot tech job market, or is that moreso just applicable to programming/development? I‚Äôm prepared for and desparately craving a challenge and a new path, and feel comfortable in several other distros already (including Fedora).

For those who might want to know more about what to expect, here's a bit of a review of my experience at last week's game (which happens to be one of the most enjoyable live matches I've ever been to):

The crowd wasn't massive, but there were more people than I expected and there was such a lovely vibe. Very diverse demographic, lots of families and kids, and I only had positive interactions with staff and Springbok fans. The majority of the crowd hung around after the game to cheer the players, from their reaction you wouldn't have guessed we lost. The genuine love and appreciation was uplifting and in stark contrast to the jaded negativity I've experienced at some other games where the home team won. R20 tickets (available on Quicket) made it accessible to a wide range of people, and made travel costs easily justifiable. 

One advantage of a smaller crowd is that free, on-site parking was readily available (accessed via Hickory St, note that Cross Blvd and parking is closed for use of event staff and broadcasting vehicles). It was generally well managed. Gates open at 15:00, KO at 17:00. Getting out took some time, but amazingly everyone was considerate (actually allowing other cars to merge) and patient. There was an abundance of traffic police who did a great job. Their presence on the corner of Hickory St and Klipfontein Rd also meant that I would have been perfectly comfortable walking from and to Lower Klipfontein Rd to catch an Uber at the drop and go area.

Seating is only on the West Stand, so while the sun is up it's relatively warm. As soon as the sun dips behind the East Stand, though, it gets cold quick. Take a cap and sunnies for the first half and a jacket for the second half.

The music was mostly local and contemporary with no Sweet Caroline, Country Road, or any of the other ancient, overplayed drivel. The gwijo group in attendance were in fine voice and added so much to the overall experience. 

The stadium is in good repair, clean facilities, and easy to navigate. There was limited food and drink (perhaps understandable considering the crowd size), but not exorbitantly priced. Hot dogs and chips; corn cups, popcorn, sweets and cool drinks; and coffee were available from 3 different vendors. Queues were quick. No alcohol on sale might sound like a drawback to some, but I suspect a direct correlation to the distinct (and refreshing) lack of antisocial behaviour. 

To those who might not have many opportunities to visit Athlone and have some apprehension, there's no need. The short shot up Klipfontein Rd from the M5 is fine, and the genial crowd and well resourced security presence made for a very safe atmosphere. 

If you're in or around CT and missed last weekend's game, I would highly recommend you catch it this Saturday's. It's well worth it, and you'll get to give the Springbok Women a proper send-off before they embark on their World Cup journey to England. ",1,1753967845.0,capetown,0,1.0,False
1me1bmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1me1bmm/should_you_buy_the_best_coffee_maker_brentwood/,Should You Buy the Best Coffee Maker Brentwood TS-213W Today,"Brewing coffee is a ritual in my household, so testing out the Brentwood TS-213W turned into an exciting little escapade. I got this compact 4-cup coffee maker to see if it could handle my morning coffee chaos and live up to its hype. With its clean white finish and minimalist design, it was easy on the eyes, but I needed performance‚Äîbecause let‚Äôs be honest, looks alone don‚Äôt keep the caffeine cravings at bay.  

**Minimalist & Compact Design**  
The design of the Brentwood TS-213W is perfect for any countertop. It‚Äôs small, measuring just 8 inches deep by 7 inches wide, which made it fit snugly between my toaster and the mound of unorganized kitchen gadgets. Its white finish complemented my modern kitchen aesthetic without looking bulky or out of place. There‚Äôs a window that clearly shows the water level, which, as someone who has flooded multiple coffee makers before, speaks directly to my heart. Plus, it‚Äôs BPA-free, so I didn‚Äôt have to second guess its material safety while brewing multiple daily cups.  

**Straightforward Operation**  
Operating this coffee maker is as simple as it gets with its manual mode. Just load freshly ground coffee into the reusable filter basket (yup, no disposable filters needed), add water based on your preference, and hit the power button. That‚Äôs it‚Äîit starts brewing right away. Within minutes, my kitchen smelled like heaven! The warming plate was a lifesaver as it kept the coffee hot long enough for me to manage my grumpy dog before my first sip. 

[Check Brentwood TS-213W price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b01cgc9axc/)

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact size fits perfectly in small kitchens or office spaces.  
- The reusable filter basket cuts down the cost of disposable filters.  
- Straightforward design and operation‚Äîideal for coffee lovers who value simplicity.  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
If you‚Äôre someone who doesn‚Äôt need industrial-strength caffeine (looking at you, espresso fans), this little guy does a pretty stellar job. The coffee came out smooth, hot, and consistent every single time I made a pot. Adjusting the coffee amount was easy with the included scoop, though I did notice that if the coffee grind was too coarse, the flavor could be a bit underwhelming. That said, for its price point, it brewed as well as more expensive drip coffee makers. It‚Äôs not a high-tech gadget by any means, but for four cups of no-fuss coffee? It‚Äôs a solid performer.

**Downsides**  
- The absence of an auto shut-off feature means you‚Äôll need to babysit it a bit.  
- Cleaning the reusable filter can get a little messy, especially if you‚Äôre in a rush.  
- The capacity is perfect for small households but might fall short for larger groups.  

**Other Options**  
I‚Äôve owned a few coffee makers over the years, and one that comes to mind for comparison is the Mr. Coffee 5-Cup Mini Brewer. While Mr. Coffee offers a slightly larger pot and an auto shut-off feature, its filter system isn‚Äôt reusable, and the machine takes up more counter space. Keurig users might argue this doesn‚Äôt brew as fast, but the reusable filter of the Brentwood TS-213W easily wins out over creating mountains of K-cup waste. Between affordability and eco-friendliness, this machine struck a really nice balance.  

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
This coffee maker punches above its weight when considering its affordability versus the features it offers. Reusable parts like the mesh filter help you save on consumables, and it brews coffee that rivals machines twice its price. If you‚Äôre the type to pinch a penny but still crave a decent caffeine fix, this might be your new best friend.

1me195i,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1me195i/discover_why_nostalgia_hot_dog_steamer_review_is/,Discover Why Nostalgia Hot Dog Steamer Review is a Must for Family Gatherings,"Families flocking over for brunch, game night snacks that earn a unanimous ‚Äúwow,‚Äù and kids eagerly queuing up for warm hot dogs‚Äîthose are moments that make the Nostalgia B0B27ZW3MJ an interesting addition to anyone‚Äôs kitchen. A diner-style aesthetic couples perfectly with practicality, offering a device that handles a small party‚Äôs worth of steaming with surprising efficiency. It‚Äôs been a staple on my counter for weeks, and it's safe to say that both the good and the challenges shine through in equal measure.

**Aesthetic Appeal Meets Functionality**  
The retro-inspired aqua design isn‚Äôt just a visual win but also a conversation starter at family gatherings. Sitting charmingly on my countertop, it anchors the vibe of a laid-back diner from the 50s. The build primarily uses durable plastic, making it lightweight yet sturdy enough to handle regular use. Its compact size (13 x 10 x 10 inches) ensures it doesn‚Äôt hog all the kitchen space. That said, the slightly shiny finish might feel a tad plasticky depending on one‚Äôs aesthetic preferences.

**Cooking Made Effortless**  
This steaming tool boasts a simple 3-position cooking dial hosting High, Warm, and Off settings. Even on those mornings when my brain lagged behind my coffee, setting it up required zero brainpower. Toss in the water and switch it to High, and you‚Äôd get hot dogs ready in as little as 15-20 minutes. The built-in water-level window really saved me from any guesswork, especially when experimenting with steaming meats in beverages like beer for extra flavor. That added touch? It‚Äôs fun to play around with different liquids for seasoning experiments!

[Check Nostalgia B0B27ZW3MJ price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b27zw3mj/)

**Positives**  
The strengths of this machine extend beyond just hot dogs:
- Its capacity is rather impressive, steaming up to 20 hot dogs at a time while warming 6 buns simultaneously. It was perfect for small backyard gatherings or even quick weekday dinners.
- A bun warming tray built into the design ensures everyone enjoys perfectly soft, warm bread. No cold buns here!  
- The disassembly process takes the pain out of cleaning‚Äîhandwashing each component was a straightforward task.  
- Bonus versatility: It‚Äôs not limited to hot dogs. Steaming vegetables, fish, and breakfast sausages turned out surprisingly satisfying. Dumplings? Those worked too!

**Areas of Concern**  
However, no product reaches perfection, and this one comes with its few hiccups:
- The bun warming tray fits a maximum of 6 buns, which sometimes feels disproportionate to the 20-hot-dog steaming capacity. This mismatch led to some bun reheats during larger gatherings.
- While lightweight, the plastic construction lacks a premium feel and might show wear over time.  
- The cord storage compartment, although a nice thought, felt slightly cramped while wrapping it up for storage.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this steamer to its market challengers, the closest competitors include basic food steamers and larger professional-grade steam tables. Commonly known steamers lack the dedicated bun-warming feature, granting this model an edge in the hot dog niche. On the flip side, if veggie or fish steaming is an everyday affair in your kitchen, a high-end steamer might yield better performance. Affordability, though, is where this Nostalgia steamer outpaces rivals‚Äîit delivers solid results without denting your wallet.

**Price Performance**  
Looking at the price relative to the features, it‚Äôs safe to say you get good value with this product. Certainly not a luxury appliance, but meeting its utility expectations makes it quite worth considering for any hot dog enthusiast or family entertainer. Its ability to serve as a multi-purpose steamer further sweetens the deal for anyone multitasking in their kitchen.

A mate has purchased a (brand new) coffee van and I'm trying to help him set it up. He lives in a remote community in Western Australia and is trying to get a bit of extra income.

We've powered it up with the generator and everything is working except we can't get any hot water from the machine (not from the group head, nor the hot water outlet nor the steam wand).

I can hear what I think is the water pump firing when we switch it on, and cold water comes out of the group head fine.

The pressure gauge doesn't budge and the red light to show that the boiler is heating doesn't turn on either.

Yes, you read that right. You don‚Äôt need to be a coding wizard to make computers do your chores anymore. No code automation is here, it‚Äôs friendly, and it can sprinkle some real magic over your daily grind!

Let‚Äôs look at the possibilities:

- Imagine your invoices are sent out automatically the minute a new order lands.
- Social media posts publishing themselves while you focus on creating, not copy-pasting.
- Boring data entries collected and sorted while you take a well-deserved coffee break.

All these‚Äîand tons more‚Äîare at your fingertips now, just by dragging and dropping building blocks.

Some of my favorite reasons this feels EPIC:

- **Instant Productivity Boost:** With tools like Zapier, Make, or Airtable, what used to take hours now takes minutes‚Ä¶and eventually, no time at all.
- **Experimentation Without Fear:** You get to try crazy ideas without worrying about ‚Äúbreaking the code‚Äù or bug-hunting for days.
- **Democratization of Automation:** Anyone‚Äîfrom marketers to artists to teachers‚Äîcan dream up a workflow and bring it to life.

Seeing drag-and-drop interfaces string together apps feels almost like assembling LEGO‚Äîinstead of code, you just snap automations together! Plus, the integration list is exploding. G Suite, Slack, Discord, Twitter, Notion‚ÄîI lost count of how many tools are ready to play together without fuss.

Why does this matter? Because:

- You reclaim your time for what matters. Maybe that‚Äôs growing your side project, being with your kids, designing wild new stuff‚Äîwhatever sparks your fire.
- Real magic is building something that just *works* for you, customized and humming along in the background.

I‚Äôd love to know:

Look, I know this sub gets flooded with ""Which watch should I buy?"" posts weekly. The answer is almost always Garmin, and here's why in plain English:

**They just work.** While other brands chase flashy features, Garmin nailed the basics that actually matter for triathlon:

* Bulletproof GPS that doesn't lose you mid-bike leg
* Transition detection that actually detects transitions
* Battery life that survives your longest training days
* Data that coaches and platforms actually use

# [The Garmin Triathlon Lineup (What You Actually Need)](https://besttriathletes.com/triathlon-watches/)

# Best Overall: Garmin Forerunner 965

**Price:** \~$650 **Reality Check:** ""My current favourite triathlon watch is the ever-so-capable Garmin Forerunner 965, a premium option that does everything better than all other wearables on the market.""

**Why Triathletes Love It:**

* Practically indestructible (I've seen these survive bike crashes)
* Insane battery life for ultra-distance events
* Every possible metric you could want
* Works as your daily smartwatch too

**Best For:** People who train in harsh conditions, ultra-distance athletes **Skip If:** You don't need tank-level durability

# Best Budget Option: Garmin Forerunner 265

**Price:** \~$450 **Reality Check:** ""If you are looking for the best budget triathlon watch on the market, you can't go wrong with the Forerunner 265.""

**What You Get:**

* All essential triathlon features
* AMOLED screen (huge upgrade from older models)

**What Makes It Special:**

* Latest training algorithms
* Enhanced multisport modes
* Premium materials and build quality
* Future-proof feature set

**Best For:** Competitive athletes who want cutting-edge training tools **Skip If:** The 965 already does everything you need

# The Features That Actually Matter (Ignore the Marketing Fluff)

# Must-Haves:

* **Multisport Mode:** One-button transitions between swim/bike/run
* **Open Water GPS:** Tracks your swim when pools aren't available
* **Power Meter Support:** For serious bike training
* **Training Load Balance:** Prevents overtraining across all three sports
* **Recovery Advisor:** Tells you when you're actually ready for hard sessions

# Nice-to-Haves:

* **Maps:** Great for new bike routes, not essential
* **Music Storage:** Cool but your phone probably works better
* **Contactless Payments:** Handy for post-race coffee
* **Sleep Tracking:** Good data but doesn't make you faster

# Marketing Fluff:

* **VO2 Max estimates:** Ballpark at best, don't obsess over the number
* **Race Predictions:** Fun but not accurate enough to pace by
* **Stress Monitoring:** Interesting but your RPE is more useful

# What Distance You're Training For Matters

**Sprint/Olympic Distance:**

* Forerunner 265 is perfect
* You don't need 47-day battery life for 2-hour races

**70.3 Distance:**

* Forerunner 965 hits the sweet spot
* Long enough training sessions to need better battery

**Full Ironman:**

* Fenix 8 or Forerunner 970
* You need bulletproof reliability for 12+ hour days

# Real User Feedback from the Community

**Most Common Praise:**

**Most Common Complaints:**

* ""Why are they so expensive?""
* ""Too many features I'll never use""
* ""Learning curve is steep""
* ""Looks like a computer on my wrist""

# The Uncomfortable Truth About Watch Shopping

**80% of triathletes** would be perfectly happy with the Forerunner 265.

**15%** actually need the premium features of the 965/970.

**5%** legitimately need Fenix-level ruggedness.

**But 60%** buy more watch than they need because of FOMO.

# Red Flags to Avoid

* Buying based on features you *might* use someday
* Getting caught up in marginal battery life differences
* Choosing based on looks over functionality
* Buying the newest model when last year's is 90% as good

# Alternative Reality Check

**Non-Garmin Options Worth Considering:**

* **Corus Apex Pro 2:** Great value at $499, facing off with Garmin's Forerunner 955
* **Polar Vantage V2:** Strong for training analysis
* **Suunto Race:** Beautiful design, different ecosystem

But honestly? Unless you have a specific reason to go elsewhere, Garmin is the safe choice.",1,1753967443.0,BestTriathletes,0,1.0,False
1me1596,https://youtube.com/watch?v=KJsNjZXmJtk&si=w-_XJjC7XydPhM0R,02 Why Your Brain Can t Be Trusted,"Dr. Sudheendra S. G.'s research report on behavioral genetics and human psychology highlights the crucial role of scientific methodology in understanding human behavior, emphasizing the limitations of intuition and common sense. The report debunks popular notions and provides a comprehensive overview of psychological research methods, biases, and the importance of replication.

Main Themes and Key Ideas:

**1. The Fallibility of Intuition and Common Sense:** Dr. Sudheendra emphasizes that ""your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition."" He warns against relying solely on personal feelings or common sense, as they can be misleading.

**2. Cognitive Biases that Distort Perception:**

* **Hindsight Bias (""I-Knew-It-All-Along"" phenomenon):** This bias leads individuals to believe, after an event has occurred, that they predicted or knew the outcome all along. Dr. Sudheendra explains, ""our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future.""
* **Overconfidence:** People often ""really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're really, really wrong."" This overconfidence can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
* **Perceiving Order in Random Events:** Humans have a natural tendency to see patterns or meaning in random sequences, like a series of coin flips, which can lead to ""false assumptions.""

**3. The Necessity of Psychological Research and Scientific Inquiry:** To overcome these biases and gain accurate insights into the mind, Dr. Sudheendra states, ""That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds."" He explicitly states that ""pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart,"" demonstrating how research can disprove intuitive but incorrect beliefs.

**4. The Scientific Method in Psychological Research:** Psychological research adheres to the scientific method, involving distinct steps:

* **Operationalizing Questions:** Turning general questions into ""measurable, testable propositions.""
* **Theory:** In science, a theory ""explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes."" It's not just a hunch.
* **Hypothesis:** A ""testable prediction"" derived from a theory.
* **Clear and Common Language:** Essential for reporting findings, allowing other researchers to ""replicate the experiment.""
* **Replication:** ""Replication is key."" Consistent results across different subjects or situations strengthen findings and indicate reliability.

**5. Common Psychological Research Methods:**

* **Case Studies:** ""Take an in-depth look at one individual.""
* **Pros:** Good for showing ""what CAN happen"" and framing questions for future research. Often memorable for storytelling.
* **Cons:** ""Can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of over-generalizing.""
* **Naturalistic Observation:** Researchers ""simply watch behavior in a natural environment"" without manipulation.
* **Pros:** Great at ""describing behavior.""
* **Cons:** ""Very limited in explaining it.""
* **Surveys/Interviews:** Collecting data by ""asking people to report their opinions and behaviors.""
* **Pros:** Great for accessing ""consciously held attitudes and beliefs.""
* **Cons:** ""How to ask the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results.""
* **Sampling Bias:** The importance of a ""random sample where all members of the target group...had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question"" to ensure representativeness.

**6. Correlation vs. Causation:** Dr. Sudheendra stresses a critical distinction: ""correlation is not causation."" While correlations can ""predict the possibility of cause-and-effect relationships,"" they ""cannot prove them."" He uses the example of eating questionable pizza and hallucinations, illustrating that other confounding factors (like sleep deprivation or migraine) could be the true cause, even if the events appear linked.

**7. The Power of Experimentation:** To establish cause-and-effect relationships, ""you're gonna have to start experimenting.""

* **Independent Variable:** The variable that is manipulated by the investigator.
* **Dependent Variable:** The variable that is measured and ""depends on the thing that you can change.""
* **Experimental Group:** Receives the manipulation of the independent variable.
* **Control Group:** Does not receive the manipulation; used for comparison.
* **Random Assignment:** Crucial for minimizing ""potential confounding variables,"" ensuring participants are distributed evenly across groups.
* **Placebo:** An inert substance used in control groups to account for psychological effects.
* **Double-Blind Procedure:** When neither the participants nor the researchers know who is in the experimental or control group, preventing unintentional influence on results.
* **Informed Consent:** Obtaining permission from participants, as suggested by the Indian Psychological Association, before they participate in an experiment.

**8. Example of an Experiment (Caffeine and Problem Solving):** Dr. Sudheendra walks through designing an experiment to test if ""humans solve problems faster when given caffeine,"" demonstrating the application of these principles:

* **Hypothesis:** ""Adult humans given caffeine will navigate a maze faster than humans not given caffeine.""
* **Independent Variable:** Caffeine dosage (e.g., decaf placebo, low dose, high dose).
* **Dependent Variable:** Speed of maze navigation.
* **Random Assignment:** Participants are randomly assigned to three groups.
* **Measurement:** Comparing maze completion times across groups.

**Conclusion:** Dr. Sudheendra S. G.'s report underscores that ""Science is probably the best tool that you have for understanding other people."" By employing rigorous scientific methods, psychologists can move beyond intuitive biases to systematically observe, describe, predict, and ultimately understand the complex nature of human behavior, paving the way for future research into areas like the ""chemical mind.""

1me132t,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1me132t/why_choose_icepure_rwf1000a_water_filter_review/,"Why Choose ICEPURE RWF1000A Water Filter Review for Cleaner, Tastier Refrigerator Water?","The ICEPURE RWF1000A Replacement Water Filter has been sitting in my refrigerator, diligently doing its job, for a little over a month now, and I've got to say ‚Äì it‚Äôs not a product you take for granted. I popped it into my LG LFX25960ST fridge mainly because my tap water tastes like it‚Äôs been on a wild adventure through old plumbing. These three-pack filters provide a more elegant solution than constantly trying to mask the taste of chlorine with lemon slices. Though I‚Äôm impressed, there‚Äôs certainly much to unpack here.

**ADVANTAGES**  
This replacement filter comes with a lot of upsides that made me wonder why I hadn‚Äôt tried it before.  

- It‚Äôs NSF/ANSI 42 & 372 CERTIFIED, meaning it meets the high standards for reducing chlorine and other impurities while maintaining lead-free, food-grade safety.  
- Its ability to retain beneficial minerals had me intrigued, and my water actually does taste noticeably cleaner ‚Äì a tiny victory for my morning coffee ritual.  
- The use of premium BPA-free materials and natural coconut shell carbon is an environmental plus. The carbon blocks are tested to filter out heavy metals, large sediments, and unpleasant odors effectively.  
- Installing it was a breeze. If you're all thumbs like me, don't worry ‚Äì the packaging somehow makes you feel like a DIY expert.  

**SHORTCOMINGS**  
Despite its benefits, no product is without a few hurdles:  

- While it's compatible with multiple refrigerator models (like Kenmore 9990 and LG LT600P), the sheer variety can feel overwhelming. Double-checking model numbers made my head spin for a bit.  
- You need to run a few gallons of water through the unit after installation. This ‚Äúpriming‚Äù step was a tad annoying, especially when all you want is clean water ASAP.   
- My partner noticed the water flow slowed down slightly compared to the old filter, probably due to the tighter filtration.  

**BUILD AND MATERIALS**  
Its dimensions (2.6"" x 7.7"" x 12.4"") and its sleek white design fit comfortably inside our fridge without any hassle. Weighing just 12.1 ounces, the lightweight nature adds no strain during installation or daily usage. Knowing that it‚Äôs made from lead-free and BPA-free materials gives me peace of mind. The outer 0.5-micron filter burst any doubts I had about its filtration capabilities.  

**EFFICIENCY AT WORK**  
The first noticeable difference was the absence of that sharp chlorine scent in the water. It removes 99% of chlorine, THM, VOCs, and particles, significantly improving the taste. Since my household drinks more water than ever, we‚Äôre likely absorbing fewer harmful substances, which makes the investment worthwhile. Moreover, the filter retains age-old minerals, ensuring health benefits don‚Äôt ‚Äúfilter out‚Äù along with the nasties.  

[Check ICEPURE RWF1000A price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b00xnooj9i/)

**USER FRIENDLINESS**  
What stood out was how user-friendly the product truly is. The setup process involved twisting and locking the filter into place ‚Äì practically fool-proof. Considering that the filter lasts for about six months or filters 300 gallons of water (whichever comes first), maintaining it doesn‚Äôt feel like a chore. I appreciate that the system sends subtle hints (like decreased water flow) when it's time to replace it.  

**PEER PRODUCTS**  
Compared to competitors like the GE XWF Refrigerator Water Filter or the Samsung HAF-CIN, this ICEPURE product offers a balance of performance and certified safety. While the Samsung filter tends to lean on higher durability, ICEPURE excels in certifications and food-grade material quality. Another contender, Waterdrop WD-LT600P, matches performance but comes at a higher price point for similar features. If affordability meets efficacy is your vibe, this filter ticks the boxes better than most.  

**SMART SPENDING**  
You‚Äôd expect a water filter of this caliber to come with a hefty price tag, especially with its high certification standards. However, what makes it a smart buy is its balance ‚Äì three filters in a pack offer a good enough supply to last over a year, making it cost-effective for most households. Try calculating the money wasted on bottled water; compared to that, this filter system saves both your wallet and the environment.

1me10c7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1me10c7/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Express Works,"I‚Äôve been using the Keurig K-Express 5000377904 daily for a couple of weeks now, and it has seamlessly blended into my busy home routine. Mornings tend to be chaotic as everyone in the house has their own schedule, but this single-serve K-Cup coffee maker has managed to make breakfast hours surprisingly calmer. Its compact size is perfect for my limited counter space, and the mint color adds a splash of modern charm to my otherwise neutral-colored kitchen. I appreciate its minimalist design; it‚Äôs sleek yet simple enough not to dominate the countertop. The hassle-free operation, along with its multiple brew size options, has been a game changer.

**User-Friendly Features**

One of the most impressive aspects of this coffee maker is how intuitive and simple it is to use. With buttons as the primary interface, it‚Äôs almost impossible to mess up. The machine offers three brew sizes: 8, 10, and 12 ounces, which is great because everyone in my household has different preferences. Personally, I love the strong brew option. Pressing the STRONG button noticeably intensifies the taste, something I rely on when mornings are extra sluggish. Just pop in a compatible pod, fill the reservoir, and within minutes, you have steaming hot coffee ‚Äì no fuss involved.

[Check Keurig 5000377904 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b0cck2vytx/)

**Performance and Speed**

Coffee is brewed incredibly fast with this unit. I was amazed the first time I used it; the machine doesn‚Äôt require an extended preheating period between cups, resulting in almost back-to-back brewing. This is particularly handy when hosting breakfast with friends or when one cup isn‚Äôt enough (let‚Äôs be honest, that‚Äôs most mornings for me). Each cup is brewed fresh, and the flavors are consistent every time. I tried both pod coffee and a reusable My K-Cup (sold separately) with my own ground coffee; the latter worked better than I expected, providing robust flavor without leakage or clogging.

**Design Benefits**

The 42oz removable reservoir allows brewing up to four cups before needing a refill. Its placement and easy detachability made it simple to refill at my kitchen faucet, saving me from spills. And speaking of thoughtful design, the adjustable drip tray deserves a shout-out. Thanks to its height clearance, it comfortably accommodates my taller travel mugs, which means I can grab my coffee to-go without transferring it to another cup. The compact, space-saving frame is also a major plus. Measuring just 12.8 inches in depth and 5.1 inches in width, it doesn‚Äôt crowd my countertop, yet offers such a robust feature set.

**Winning Points**

- Compact, sleek design that fits small spaces  
- STRONG brew feature for a bolder coffee experience  
- Fast brewing with no waiting between cups  
- Compatible with both pods and reusable filters  

**Areas for Improvement**

There are some minor inconveniences, though. For starters, the lack of a programmable timer feels like a missed opportunity. I‚Äôve had older coffee makers where setting the machine the night before ensured coffee at the perfect time in the morning. Another small annoyance is the noise level. While brewing, it‚Äôs not the quietest machine. This might matter in households where others are still asleep during early morning brewing sessions. Additionally, I wish it came with a reusable filter in the box instead of requiring a separate purchase.

- No programmable timer for pre-scheduling brews  
- Louder operation compared to other models  
- Reusable filter not included  

**Competing Products**

When compared to competing single-serve brewers like the Nespresso Vertuo, the Keurig K-Express holds its own with affordability and versatility. Unlike the Vertuo, which primarily supports Nespresso pods, the Keurig can use hundreds of different K-Cup pod options from multiple brands. However, the Keurig lacks the advanced milk frothing features found in some Nespresso models, which might be a dealbreaker for latte or cappuccino lovers. It also outshines more basic coffee makers that don‚Äôt offer the strong brew feature, making it a solid choice for flavor enthusiasts like myself.

**Affordable Quality**

The Keurig K-Express 5000377904 offers an excellent balance between functionality and price. It‚Äôs not the cheapest coffee maker on the market, but the features packed into this sleek, mint-colored device justify the investment. From customizable brew sizes and fast output to its compact build, you‚Äôre genuinely getting value for your money. While some minor features could enhance the overall experience, they don‚Äôt detract from its primary purpose of delivering great coffee efficiently.

This is a resort unlike anywhere we've been in the past.  It's part traditional hotel/spa/dining experience and part rich man's boondoggle.  The two aren't well integrated.  The bird logo is an interesting choice.  It doesn't feel consistent with either the property or the architecture.  Overall there's no clear concept here.  

Property: Odd mix of architectural styles from faux french chateau to faux hunting lodge with some Frank LLoyd Wright thrown in with the Falling Rock golf club property.  We stayed in a standard king room in the Chateau.  Rooms were well appointed with beautiful amenities.  Rooms were very clean.  Housekeeping service was excellent and prompt.  Cookies with tundown that can be warmed by your butler on request are a nice touch.  Lights and curtains are controlled by a touchscreen.  We saw employees constantly maintaining the property while we were there including leveling the art in hallways (with an actual level), cleaning the glass in the lobby several times a day to clear condensation from the windows due to humidity, etc.  Only odd thing in a property of this caliber is that it felt like there was a plastic sheet on the mattress covered by the fitted sheet with no mattress pad.      

Service:  Rooms in the Chateau (and maybe elsewhere?) come with a butler.  Ours showed us the room amenities when we checked in and served coffee in the mornings but those were our only interactions.  An app offers the ability to order from a pillow menu and select complementary amenities like toothpaste, toothbrushes, etc.  Staff all over the property seemed genuinely happy to be there including shuttle drivers who sometimes personalized their shuttles with things like disco lights and disco music in the evenings when driving to/from hotels and restaurants.     

Food: saw some reviews here about subpar food.  That wasn't our experience.  Dinner at Aqueous in the Falling Rock was incredible both in terms of service and the food itself.  Room service for breakfast was good quality and fast with a very nice presentation.  Coffee service in the room every morning on request offered via the butler is a nice touch.  The only puzzler was lunch -- options are limited and generally seem to be in the onsite bars.  Lautrec (onsite French restaurant) is closed.  We didn't eat at Fawn and Fable so can't comment there.  

Spa: Facility is beautiful -- multiple floors and the usual variety of spa services.  I had a massage.  Therapist was good and friendly.  Only odd experience was after I was shown into the relaxation room after my service.  There were approx 10 lounges and 4 chairs with only two people in the room.  An attendant asked me to move to another lounge (""any one is ok"") because she had two guests who were about to come out of their service and one needed my spot (?).      

Activities: we walked through the Peak facility where paintball, ziplining, ebike rentals, etc. are located.  Some people were shooting paintball guns at targets but it was otherwise mostly empty with some kids arriving.  There's a pool and restaurant/bar in this facility that feels generally aimed at families and kids.  There's a car ""museum"" that's really a small building with the now deceased owner's car collection.  There are a few antique cars and a run of luxury cars that were new in the late 90s.  There's also a small building with a couple of aircraft.  There's a small zoo that we didn't explore but drove by with one of the shuttle drivers.  Some people in our group golfed and said they had a good experience.  We enjoy spending time outdoors and would have spent more time walking the property and possibly at one of the pools if the weather had been better.  

General: holy cow is it oppressively humid in Farmington, PA in July.  If you are hoping to spend time outdoors come at another time.  Even a walk from your room to a restaurant in another building isn't really an option this time of year unless you don't mind being soggy by the time you arrive.  It's a 1 hr 45 min drive from the Pittsburgh airport so a bit of a hop if you've already spent a fair amout of time flying.  Overall the property seemed fairly empty during our visit.  Imagine this is because of the weather this time of year.    

I'd say the overall experience was good but we won't be back.  I wouldn't recommend it to a west coast resident traveling without kids.  Still trying to wrap my head around this property in general.

I'm in the UK. Sorry it's a long one! 
Edit: I'm F32. 

I suffered with bilary cholic for 3.5 years prior to surgery because it took so long to get diagnosed. Flare ups were always in the early hours of the morning, pain excruciating but gone within an hour or 2 so I was often convinced I was making up how bad it was. 

Fast forward 3 years and I finally get my diagnosis in February thanks to an ultrasound confirming multiple gallstones and inflammation. Had my surgery on 16th July. It was a day case, in at 7am and home in my own bed by 3:30pm. 

7am - saw the anaesthetist, surgeon and got into my gown by 7:45am. Went in at 8:30am. Fell asleep talking about my PhD, woke up at 10:30am. I was in agony so they gave me some pretty strong painkillers via my canula and immediately after that I was much more comfortable. I was kept on the day ward until about 3pm but this was mainly due to slightly low blood pressure and an issue with a new computer system which meant discharging me was administratively difficult. Staff were lovely, I had jam on toast x 2 within about 2 hours of surgery. On discharge I was given a week's supply of codeine and a laxative (due to codeine side effects) and told to alternate codeine with paracetamol. 

I ate a homemade, fat free lentil & vegetable soup about 4pm, had a cup of tea (without milk) and fell asleep about 7pm. 

I'll summarise the rest of my recovery under themes:

1. Eating and digestion - I have eaten everything I normally would, including foods I couldn't eat pre surgery, with no side effects. No diarrhea. I was constipated for 5 days because of the codeine, and the laxative did nothing to help, but some emergency prune juice on day 5 did the job and I've been regular ever since. I did however eat a fat free diet for 48 hours post surgery and introduced foods slowly. First 48 hours: water, soup, sourdough, spaghetti hoops. Then coffee on day 2, olive oil on day 3, chocolate on day 4, so that I could be clear what might cause a problem. Thankfully nothing did! I avoided all carbonated drinks until today, which I think helped with the gas. Since, I've had pasta, pizza, chinese takeaway, chips, peanut butter, cake etc. But always in moderation - just because I can eat it now, doesn't mean overeating is ever going to be good for me (damn it). 

2. Pain - I had no shoulder pain or pain from gas, though my stomach was heavily swollen and bloated for about a week. By far the worst pain was at the incision at my belly button, which felt like it was tearing every time I moved. BUT only if I missed my painkiller schedule or moved too quickly. Sleep was the hardest because I'm a side sleeper. I found that having pillows down my side that I could sort of lean into helped, and I've been able to sleep on my side with no pain since about day 9. I worked on moving gently from day 2. Little shuffles down the corridor of my flats, then round the block etc. This really helped ease the bloat. I got a second week of half dose codeine because I felt that it would help me return to normal movement. It did! 2 weeks on, I now only have pain if I walk too far without resting. The other incisions were mostly painless, just a little itchy/uncomfortable as they healed. 

3. Other symptoms - I've found that I don't really get feelings of hunger now until I'm ravenous and lightheaded, so I've had to keep aware of what time it is and eat little and often. This seems to be easing now. I also get light headed if I do too much physically exerting activity, but this is usually solved by some kind of sweet treat. Also I got suuuuper emotional in week 2, like once the adrenaline wore off I was mentally like 'oh my, it's really gone' and I cried A LOT. 

4. Final advice - my boss said to me 'just because it's routine for the surgeon, doesn't mean it's routine for you' and that's been my motto, treating my body with the kindness it deserves and not rushing it. I've tried not to put my body under too much pressure all at once - so if I'm trying a new food, then leaving it a couple of hours before then trying to move. Be prepared to feel like you're going backwards, when actually it's that you're doing more and therefore the pain is worse.

Now, I'm writing this 2 weeks on, sitting in a park, having just done a work meeting where I ate cake and drank coffee. My wounds are mostly healed, stitches are starting to dissolve, though I'm still wearing comfy clothes so they don't press or rub as that can be uncomfortable. I walked 7km yesterday and took a train trip to another city. Today, I'm exhausted, so I'm taking it slower. I reckon another week and I'll be back to relatively normal. 

And amongst all of that, the thing I realised is how much pain I really did endure for 3. 5 years. Not one second of the pain over the last 2 weeks, even right after surgery, ever got close to the pain of a flare up. And so I'm proud of myself for getting through all I did, and very, very excited for life now it's done!

Hope this helps someone üòä",1,1753966953.0,gallbladders,0,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn‚Äîit‚Äôs time to dissect the Canadian Open third-round clash between fourth-seeded prodigy **Mirra Andreeva** and 28th-seeded underdog **McCartney Kessler**. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a perfectly placed drop shot and the humor of a player who‚Äôs just realized they‚Äôre wearing socks with sandals.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Your Grandma Would Bet on Mirra

The bookmakers are throwing up their hands in near-unanimous agreement: **Mirra Andreeva is the heavy favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.25-1.27** (implying an **80%+ implied probability** of victory). For Kessler, the long shot, the odds range from **3.8-4.0** (a **25% chance** to pull off the upset). To put this in perspective, betting on Andreeva is like betting the sun will rise tomorrow. Betting on Kessler? That‚Äôs the equivalent of betting a squirrel will solve quantum physics during a midday nap.

Statistically, Andreeva‚Äôs dominance this year is staggering: **36 wins from 47 matches** (76.6% win rate). Kessler, while respectable with **28 wins from 45 matches** (62.2%), trails like a tennis ball in a hurricane. The article even concedes that Andreeva is ‚Äúmaking the step up everyone was expecting,‚Äù but also cryptically warns this match is ‚Äúinteresting.‚Äù Translation: *Don‚Äôt get too comfortable, bookmakers.*

### News Digest: Injuries, Walkovers, and One Player Who‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Here for the Vibe‚Äù

Andreeva enters this match with a **walkover** from Bianca Andreescu, which is tennis parlance for ‚Äúyour opponent decided to take a coffee break and never left.‚Äù While she‚Äôs been a rising force this year, her path so far has been smoother than a freshly waxed pickleball court.

I really struggle with myself. I'm aro-ace, but I really really want to be someone's person. You know that person you tell everything to and want to talk to about anything and everything? I want that, but I struggle thinking that I'm good enough for it. I don't want physical intimacy, so that leads me to stay alone. Why let someone be stuck with me if I can't feel those romantic or intimate things that they would? That seems unfair of me, that I wouldn't be able to reciprocate that.   
  
Underlying that is the deep sense of never being good enough for anything or anyone. How could someone ever care about or love me if I can't love them back? To be clear, I do love things, just differently than what is normal. I've never had a crush. Never thought someone looked ""cute"" or whatever. I don't even understand those things even in my late 20s.   
  
And that's where the problem lies I suppose. I want to be loved in the way that I love people. I can't feel the romance and I don't understand it. My love is through attention. I pay attention to the little things people do or like. What makes someone happy. Their favorite foods or colors. And yet it feels like I'm asking too much for someone to pay attention to something literally as simple as how I like my coffee. I don't want to have to tell someone that that's important to me, but I also understand that if I don't then they would never know because I'm weird. Maybe a little broken. At the very least not normal. I wish I could feel the things other people. Understand them. I've not been in a relationship for years. How can I ever ask someone for anything if I can't feel it back? I think maybe I am just not meant for relationships despite desperately wanting \*something\* so I don't feel like this anymore. And that doesn't even touch on the deep fear of having someone important to me leave. 

I'm sorry if this is disjointed. I just let myself type. I've never told anyone this and I don't know what to do with myself. I can't keep pretending that I'm okay when I'm not. But I don't want to hurt anyone either. ",1,1753966849.0,offmychest,2,0.99,False

# Best Coffee Filter Packs 2025: Expert Reviews & Buying Guide

Coffee filter ‚Äãpacks have revolutionized‚Å¢ the way we brew coffee, offering a convenient and mess-free alternative‚Äç too conventional methods.These pre-portioned packs contain ‚Å§ground coffee and a‚Å£ filter all-in-one, making them ideal for busy mornings or single-serve coffee makers. ‚ÄåAs we approach 2025, the market is filled with numerous‚Äã options, each claiming to offer the best experience. This extensive guide will explore the top coffee filter packs available, providing expert reviews ‚Å¢and insights to help you make an informed decision.‚Å¢ We'll‚Äå delve into the key features, benefits, and drawbacks ‚Äçof each ‚Äãproduct, ensuring you find the perfect coffee filter pack to suit your taste and lifestyle.

## Key features Analysis

the quality of a coffee filter pack hinges on several key features that directly impact ‚Å§the brewing process and‚Å£ the resulting cup of coffee.

**Filter ‚Å§Material:** The type of filter paper used is crucial for flavor extraction and sediment filtration.

Filter packs utilize various materials ranging from bleached to‚Äç unbleached paper, ‚Å£and even‚Å£ some made from plant-based materials like hemp ‚Å£or bamboo. The best filters‚Å£ effectively remove fine particles and oils while allowing the desirable flavors and aromas to pass through. Look for filters that ‚Äåare thick enough to prevent tearing but porous enough to ensure optimal water flow.

**Coffee Blend:** The quality and origin of the coffee beans used in‚Å¢ the filter pack substantially influence the taste profile.

Brands typically offer a wide range‚Å£ of blends, from light and fruity to dark and bold, catering to different preferences. It's vital to consider whether ‚Äåthe coffee is sourced‚Å£ ethically ‚Å¢(e.g.,‚Äç Fair Trade certified) and roasted to perfection. Single-origin offerings provide a unique ‚Å§flavor experience, highlighting the characteristics of ‚Å¢a specific region, while‚Å¢ blends combine different beans for a‚Å§ balanced and complex taste.

**Portion Size:** The amount of coffee in each filter pack determines the‚Äå strength of the brew and can vary depending ‚Å£on the intended ‚Äãuse.

Most filter packs ‚Å§contain between 8 and 12 grams of coffee, designed for ‚Äåsingle-serve coffee makers or small batches. It's essential to choose a ‚Å£portion size that aligns with your preferred coffee strength. Some packs are designed for specific machines, while others are more versatile ‚Å£and can be used with different brewing methods.

**Packaging:** The packaging of the filter packs plays a vital role in‚Å¢ maintaining freshness and ‚Äåpreventing oxidation.

Airtight and resealable packaging is essential‚Å§ to preserve the‚Å¢ coffee's aroma and flavor over time. Look for packs that‚Å£ are nitrogen-flushed or vacuum-sealed to ‚Äåminimize exposure to air. individual wrapping of each filter pack ensures maximum freshness and prevents the‚Å§ coffee from becoming stale.

**Compatibility:** Compatibility with various coffee makers is ‚Å¢a ‚Å§critical consideration for users with different brewing systems.

Some filter ‚Äãpacks are specifically designed for certain single-serve machines, such as Senseo or Keurig (using a reusable filter). Versatile ‚Å¢packs can be used with drip coffee makers, French presses, or pour-over methods. It's important ‚Äçto check the packaging or product‚Å£ description to ensure compatibility with your coffee maker.

## Core Benefits

Coffee filter packs offer several practical benefits that make‚Å£ them ‚Äça convenient and ‚Å¢efficient choice for coffee lovers.

**Simplified Brewing Process:** Filter packs streamline the brewing ‚Å§process by eliminating the ‚Äãneed to ‚Å§measure coffee grounds and handle messy filters. Everything is pre-portioned and ready to go, saving time and effort. This is notably beneficial for busy individuals or those who want ‚Å¢a quick and ‚Å¢easy cup of coffee without the fuss.**Consistent Coffee Quality:** Each filter ‚Äãpack contains a precise amount of‚Å¢ coffee, ensuring a consistent and‚Äå reliable brew every time. This eliminates the guesswork and variability associated with manual measuring, resulting in ‚Äãa ‚Äåpredictable‚Å¢ and satisfying cup of coffee. Whether‚Å¢ you prefer a strong or mild brew, filter packs allow you to replicate your favorite coffee with ease.

**Reduced Mess and Cleanup:** Filter packs significantly reduce mess and cleanup compared to traditional ‚Äåcoffee-making methods. The pre-packaged design‚Å§ contains the coffee grounds, minimizing spills and drips. Once brewing is complete,simply discard the ‚Äåused ‚Äçfilter pack,eliminating the need to wash messy filters or coffee pots.

**Portability and Convenience:** Coffee filter‚Å§ packs are highly‚Å£ portable and convenient for travel, camping, or office use. ‚Å£Their compact size and individual packaging make them easy to pack and transport. whether you're on a business trip or‚Äã enjoying the ‚Å£great outdoors, filter packs allow you to enjoy a fresh cup ‚Å§of coffee anywhere, anytime.

## FAQs Section

**Are coffee‚Äç filter packs environmentally kind?**
The environmental impact of coffee filter packs depends on the materials used and the disposal method. Some brands offer compostable or biodegradable filter papers and packaging, reducing their impact on landfills. Look‚Äå for certifications such as ""compostable"" ‚Äãor ""biodegradable"" on the packaging. Consider composting the used filter packs at home or in a‚Å¢ commercial composting ‚Äãfacility.**Can I use coffee filter packs in a regular drip coffee maker?**
Yes, many coffee filter packs are compatible ‚Äãwith regular drip‚Å£ coffee makers. Simply place the filter pack ‚Äãin the ‚Äçcoffee maker's filter basket and brew‚Äç as usual. Though, it's ‚Äçcritically important to check‚Äã the packaging or product description to ensure compatibility with your specific coffee maker model. Some filter packs may be too small or too large for certain filter baskets.

**how‚Å¢ long do coffee filter packs stay fresh?**
the freshness of coffee filter packs depends on the packaging and storage conditions.Properly sealed and stored filter packs can maintain their freshness for several months. Look for packs with airtight and resealable packaging‚Å¢ to minimize exposure to air. Store the filter packs in ‚Äça cool, dry place away from direct sunlight or heat. Check the expiration date or ""best by"" date on the ‚Å§packaging for optimal freshness.

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn‚Äîit‚Äôs time for a third-round Canadian Open clash that‚Äôs less *Wimbledon* and more *Weird Racket Dreams*. Daria Kasatkina, the 15th seed with a game as steady as a coffee addict‚Äôs heartbeat, faces Marta Kostyuk, the 24th seed who‚Äôs turned her recent matches into a break-point carnival. Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a player who just realized their shoelaces are untied mid-match.

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

The bookmakers are throwing their weight behind Kostyuk, who‚Äôs priced at **1.61-1.67** (implying a **62-61% win probability**), while Kasatkina sits at **2.25-2.35** (**43-45%**). On paper, this suggests Kostyuk is the favorite. But hold your horses! The article insists Kasatkina‚Äôs ‚Äúexcellent court coverage and calculated shot placements‚Äù will carry her to victory, citing her **4-3 head-to-head edge** and **2-1 advantage on hard courts**. It‚Äôs like if your grandma told you to trust her lasagna recipe, but the betting odds say your food blogger neighbor‚Äôs carbonara is better. Confusing, but we‚Äôll dig deeper.

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Form, and Break-Point Mayhem

Kasatkina‚Äôs recent 6-1, 6-4 win over Anna Blinkova was a masterclass in efficiency‚Äîthink of her as a tennis Swiss Army knife: sharp, reliable, and occasionally flashy. However, her season on hard courts has been ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù (translation: she‚Äôs had more double faults than a confused fan at a tiebreaker). Kostyuk, meanwhile, just pulled off a **seven-break-point conversion** comeback against Marketa Vondrousova. That‚Äôs like hitting seven free throws in a row while juggling pineapples.

1me0sqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1me0sqf/i_feel_like_im_losing_it/,I feel like I'm losing it,"I saw a neurologist, had a normal MRI and have been prescribed preventative meds. All of this is just me venting/looking for reassurance that I'm not losing my mind

My fucking head makes me feel like I'm going mad. Not because I'm in insane pain or anything. I almost wish I was in a lot of pain so that I would stop questioning everything. 

The last 2 months (since May really, but especially in June-July) it goes like this: I wake up in pain (headache on the left side or face pain, most often, but most of my head has hurt at some point). Sometimes I can barely feel it when I wake up but around 11-12 am it gets bad enough to have some impact on my activities. 

Sometimes it goes away at around 9pm but not always and almost never completely (I suspect it's because the temps drop around 9pm). 

So like, I mostly wake up and go to sleep feeling some degree of head pain. OTCs don't help anymore (I only take them when the pain gets to 5-6 or worse) and then they barely touch it, it never goes away completely. Coffee doesn't help in small amounts, I need to drink a lot, and then I can't sleep at night and it's messed with my sleep schedule.

Yesterday I wanted to ""test"" if I was getting a migraine and did 30 squats. (yes stupid I know. I'll probably do it again in the future). A full blown migraine immediately followed and the abortive didn't help much because I took it too late.

Any amount of stress, excitement, loud noise or flickering/bright lights is enough to make my head start hurting more in this specific spot on the left side. My left eye is doing weird things I don't know how to describe (it's not aura, I don't see anything, it's a sort of squeezing feeling behind my eye and my vision is always a bit blurry).

These past 2 weeks since I saw a neurologist I did everything ""right."" Sleep, eating healthy, supplements, exercise, walks, contrast showers, little to no stress, even metitation. Routine is very hard for me and I'm already slipping today but I'm doing my best. Barely any improvement, my head still hurts every single day and 3 of them were full blown migraines. Before all of this I could still tell when the prodrome started, followed by the headache and postdrome. Now it's a 2 month continuum where I cannot tell when a bad migraine will hit because it literally hurts all the time.

And YET (or because of this), I'm questioning everything. Am I even in enough pain to warrant preventative meds (it's been between 3 and 5 most days in the last 2 months)? Is all of this cause by the migraine disorder? Am I getting other kinds of headaches? How many of them are actually migraines when I have some combination of symptoms at varying degrees of intensity all the damn time?

And on top of that I still haven't started the preventatives (escitalopram and a beta-blocker) because just thinking about possible side effects is making my headache worse. But it seems like I'll have to.

1me0qsq,https://i.redd.it/38xpcbtog7gf1.jpeg,My dream garage that I manage with the app I created. What do you use?,"Alright folks, question for the group.

I'm the designated ""car guy"" for my family, which means I get to keep track of maintenance, fuel, and all the annoying expenses for multiple cars. For a while, I tried using apps for this. I went through a bunch of them, including Drivvo, and I just couldn't stick with any of them. The user interface felt ancient on some, others were weirdly complicated for simple tasks, or they were missing features I thought would be obvious.

So, I did what any sane person would do: I spent my nights and weekends rage-building my own app to fix the problem.

It's called GarTrack, and honestly, it's made my life way easier. And I swear I'm not just saying that because my name is in the code. It‚Äôs cleaner, does exactly what I need without the fluff, and handles our mix of petrol and hybrid cars perfectly.

But here‚Äôs the thing: making apps isn't my day job. This is purely a side project fueled by frustration and too much coffee. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm blind to a million things it could do better.

So I'm curious:

1. What do you all use to track your car's life? A trusty old notebook in the glovebox? A complex Excel spreadsheet? Is there some golden app out there I completely missed?
2. If you're on iOS and feel like giving some brutally honest feedback to a hobbyist developer, would you be willing to give my app a try and tell me what's wrong with it or what features it desperately needs? An Android version is on the roadmap, but I'm just one guy, so it'll take a bit.

I'm not here to sell anything, just genuinely want to build something that car people find actually useful. Let me know your thoughts!

It seems Glasgow has been getting a lot of love from the home game recently, and honestly, why wouldn't it? With the Roundabout ticket, you can ride all the trains and subway all day for just ¬£7.70. Considering how much transport we used, that worked out at less than ¬£1 per train. A bargain for such a great day out!

We decided to play within the Glasgow City Council boundary, which limited us to 73 stations and kept the game to a manageable length. Otherwise, it would‚Äôve spilled into a second day. We also converted all distance-based questions to kilometres instead of miles, giving the Seeker a little more flexibility on such a compact map. Here's how our day played out:

We started from a Costa Coffee, conveniently located between Queen Street and Central Station. It has a back nook perfect for concealing the Seeker‚Äôs initial direction, and, crucially, good coffee for planning that first move.

I hid first. I deliberately ran out of the caf√©, only to duck into Greggs, trying to give the impression I'd gone much farther. I had time for a steak bake before casually heading to my chosen hiding spot: Alexandra Parade. Unfortunately, a stressfully delayed train got me there just seven seconds before the hiding time ended.

Sam, the Seeker, asked the ‚Äúdistance from the English border‚Äù question, expecting a clean north‚Äìsouth split. Surprisingly, it didn‚Äôt split the city that way at all. It cut from southwest to northeast, throwing both of us off. I also positioned myself cleverly within my zone, avoiding the 3 km radar by just 50 metres.

All this misdirection led Sam to believe I‚Äôd gone south. They used thermometers and took an ill-fated trip to Baillieston. During this time, Sam also asked about a visible building from the station, the widest road nearby, and the nearest hospital. These helped eliminate the entire Shettleston line, and the radar ruled out my actual station.

Eventually, Sam made their way to Robroyston, thinking it was the only viable option, only to realise after arriving that the station didn‚Äôt match the building photo. With every other possibility ruled out, Sam finally pieced it together and headed straight for me.

I was hiding on the opposite platform, thinking it‚Äôd be funny, and somehow got completely missed. After a few more questions (distance from a park and from a museum), Sam finally found me, and we swapped roles.

Sam started their round at Queen Street and immediately confused me by not taking a train from there. I ruled out the north side of the city using a mix of the ""same train line"" question, a custom radar, and a thermometer. That left just two lines on the south side and the subway.

I made a mistake by reusing the same line question, allowing Sam to draw the Curse of the Jammed Door. It didn‚Äôt stop me from getting transport thanks to a delayed bus, but it did stop me from entering a shop to find a toilet. After a short bus ride and jog, I arrived at Corkerhill. A train, a much-needed toilet stop, and a lucky ‚Äúnearest hospital‚Äù match narrowed Sam down to just one station: Crookston.

When I arrived, I got hit with the Curse of the Endless Tumble, and that one is tough. I had to throw the dice as hard as I could down a quiet street just to make the distance. Once I cleared the curse and recognised the fence in the background of Sam‚Äôs selfie, it was a quick endgame, just in time to catch a train back to Glasgow.

We had a fantastic time playing and would love to do it again, whether at the same Glasgow scale, across the full Roundabout area, or even across the Central Belt. If you‚Äôre a fellow Scottish player, get in touch!",16,1753966015.0,JetLagTheGame,2,1.0,False

So, I'm crushing over my coworker and it's getting to me haha. I think she's really smart, really sweet, and obviously really beautiful. Her glasses are cute but so are her eyes without them. I have a ""type"" and she's all that and a bag of chips. She's helped me a lot in the new job I took on. We've had to work on some projects together and she's actually taught me more than planned and she's filled some gaps that leadership clearly didn't. I'm obviously grateful to her for her help, and since I'm crushing on her I told her I owed her coffee if we ever were both in the office. That was a start, but l'd certainly offer more.
This was on a phone call though, she didn't say yes or didn't say no but l imagined she smiled and I heard her laugh. We had to talk online again this week, she asked how my weekend went and I told her it was okay and I was trying to make the most of the great summer weather outdoors. I asked her about hers she said it was quiet. I wanted to ask more but I just semi froze. I could've asked more but I didn't know if l'd come off aggressive especially after my coffee comment but maybe I'm reading too much into it. We usually don't see each other in person unless she has to go in which is almost never. She got sick the last week and I definitely was glad she got over it and let her know haha. I know two of her interests from group calls but she's usually quiet when people ask about everyone's weekend. I'm also new so l have to go in.
I obviously don't want her to get in any trouble, neither do I for that matter. I did meet a girl at another job but we were in different offices so when we broke up, yes it was tough but we didn't share an office. There was one girl who semi asked me to meet at an event; we got tickets and then she bailed. We did share an office and just shook it off.
This was after l asked her for coffee separate from our happy hour group and she didn't say anything.l know my new coworker we're both adults too and would have to handle it that way. I know it's usually not the best idea but l like her all around, and what I've learned is if you don't try taking a shot, someone else may and then you really can't.

1me0jly,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QiZu0yA9rgs&si=ZDTDp1C4oNHuE3ES,01 The Unfolding Science of the Mind,"Dr. Sudheendra S. G.'s research report on behavioral genetics and human psychology highlights the crucial role of scientific methodology in understanding human behavior, emphasizing the limitations of intuition and common sense. The report debunks popular notions and provides a comprehensive overview of psychological research methods, biases, and the importance of replication.

# Main Themes and Key Ideas:

**1. The Fallibility of Intuition and Common Sense:** Dr. Sudheendra emphasizes that ""your intuition isn't always right. In fact, sometimes it is exactly wrong, and we tend to grossly underestimate the dangers of false intuition."" He warns against relying solely on personal feelings or common sense, as they can be misleading.

**2. Cognitive Biases that Distort Perception:**

* **Hindsight Bias (""I-Knew-It-All-Along"" phenomenon):** This bias leads individuals to believe, after an event has occurred, that they predicted or knew the outcome all along. Dr. Sudheendra explains, ""our intuitive sense more easily describes what just happened, than what will happen in the future.""
* **Overconfidence:** People often ""really, really feel like you're right about people when actually you're really, really wrong."" This overconfidence can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
* **Perceiving Order in Random Events:** Humans have a natural tendency to see patterns or meaning in random sequences, like a series of coin flips, which can lead to ""false assumptions.""

**3. The Necessity of Psychological Research and Scientific Inquiry:** To overcome these biases and gain accurate insights into the mind, Dr. Sudheendra states, ""That is why we have the methods and safe-guards of psychological research and experimentation, and the glorious process of scientific inquiry. They help us to get around these problems and basically save the study of our minds from the stupidity of our minds."" He explicitly states that ""pizza won't make you trip, and coffee doesn't make you smart,"" demonstrating how research can disprove intuitive but incorrect beliefs.

**4. The Scientific Method in Psychological Research:** Psychological research adheres to the scientific method, involving distinct steps:

* **Operationalizing Questions:** Turning general questions into ""measurable, testable propositions.""
* **Theory:** In science, a theory ""explains and organizes lots of different observations and predicts outcomes."" It's not just a hunch.
* **Hypothesis:** A ""testable prediction"" derived from a theory.
* **Clear and Common Language:** Essential for reporting findings, allowing other researchers to ""replicate the experiment.""
* **Replication:** ""Replication is key."" Consistent results across different subjects or situations strengthen findings and indicate reliability.

**5. Common Psychological Research Methods:**

* **Case Studies:** ""Take an in-depth look at one individual.""
* **Pros:** Good for showing ""what CAN happen"" and framing questions for future research. Often memorable for storytelling.
* **Cons:** ""Can sometimes be misleading, because by their nature, they can't be replicated, so they run the risk of over-generalizing.""
* **Naturalistic Observation:** Researchers ""simply watch behavior in a natural environment"" without manipulation.
* **Pros:** Great at ""describing behavior.""
* **Cons:** ""Very limited in explaining it.""
* **Surveys/Interviews:** Collecting data by ""asking people to report their opinions and behaviors.""
* **Pros:** Great for accessing ""consciously held attitudes and beliefs.""
* **Cons:** ""How to ask the questions can be tricky; subtle word choices can influence results.""
* **Sampling Bias:** The importance of a ""random sample where all members of the target group...had an equal chance of being selected to answer the question"" to ensure representativeness.

**6. Correlation vs. Causation:** Dr. Sudheendra stresses a critical distinction: ""correlation is not causation."" While correlations can ""predict the possibility of cause-and-effect relationships,"" they ""cannot prove them."" He uses the example of eating questionable pizza and hallucinations, illustrating that other confounding factors (like sleep deprivation or migraine) could be the true cause, even if the events appear linked.

**7. The Power of Experimentation:** To establish cause-and-effect relationships, ""you're gonna have to start experimenting.""

* **Independent Variable:** The variable that is manipulated by the investigator.
* **Dependent Variable:** The variable that is measured and ""depends on the thing that you can change.""
* **Experimental Group:** Receives the manipulation of the independent variable.
* **Control Group:** Does not receive the manipulation; used for comparison.
* **Random Assignment:** Crucial for minimizing ""potential confounding variables,"" ensuring participants are distributed evenly across groups.
* **Placebo:** An inert substance used in control groups to account for psychological effects.
* **Double-Blind Procedure:** When neither the participants nor the researchers know who is in the experimental or control group, preventing unintentional influence on results.

Post-Nut Clarity vs. Post-Pee Clarity

Alright, folks, let‚Äôs break down two of the most profound states of human consciousness:¬†*Post-Nut Clarity*¬†(PNC) and¬†*Post-Pee Clarity*¬†(PPC). Both bring you back to reality, but one leaves you deep in regret while the other‚Äôs just pure refreshment. Let‚Äôs dive in.

# The Journey to Both:

* **PNC:**¬†Starts with that forbidden allure. The craving grows, your brain goes fuzzy, and suddenly you find yourself doing things you‚Äôd NEVER want on your search history. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre in this primal trance, locked into a mission.
* **PPC:**¬†The buildup is way more physical. It‚Äôs that ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have chugged that last cup of coffee‚Äù type of urgency. You‚Äôre dancing, maybe clenching, holding it for dear life because you‚Äôre stuck in line or some Zoom meeting from hell.

# The Release:

* **PNC:**¬†The moment you hit it, there‚Äôs this fleeting, dizzying high. But it vanishes instantly, leaving you staring at yourself, wondering, ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù You‚Äôre left with your browser tab open, side-eyeing your reflection, filled with regret and a deep need to delete your browsing history.
* **PPC:**¬†That golden moment when the stream hits the bowl‚Ä¶ oh man, it‚Äôs bliss. No shame, no regrets, just pure relief. It‚Äôs like your soul is exhaling. You‚Äôre suddenly more aware, and everything seems right with the world.

# The Aftermath:

* **PNC:**¬†You‚Äôre forced into a post-nut spiral of regret. All those strange impulses fade, and your mind gets hyper-rational. Suddenly, every life choice you‚Äôve ever made feels questionable. Maybe you‚Äôll start that hobby, or go for a walk? Spoiler: you won‚Äôt.
* **PPC:**¬†This is where the PPC shines, folks. You‚Äôre a brand new person. Your steps feel lighter. You‚Äôve unburdened yourself. You‚Äôre humming a tune as you wash your hands, maybe even checking out your reflection like, ‚ÄúYeah, I did that.‚Äù You walk away refreshed, like a damn saint.

# The Verdict:

* **PNC:**¬†A rollercoaster of desire, satisfaction, and immediate self-reflection. But at what cost? Every time you feel like you‚Äôre¬†*better*¬†than this‚Äîand yet, here you are again.
* **PPC:**¬†Just‚Ä¶ clarity. No regrets. A moment of zen, a victory you carry with pride. It‚Äôs the simplest joys, friends.",1,1753965761.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False

*Imagine evolution's most spectacular practical joke:*

**A species so monumentally stupid, that it doesn't just accept its cognitive limitations, but constructs entire mythologies of consciousness, only to have these delusions systematically dismantled by its own failing machinery.**

Dementia patients are not victims.. They are living autopsy reports, exposing the raw, deterministic reality of human existence.

Every human state.. From sleep to anesthesia, from childhood to senility.. Is merely a variation on this fundamental breakdown. Dementia isn't an aberration.. It's the most honest manifestation of what humans are always experiencing:

**A continuous, incremental disintegration of the illusion of stable consciousness.**

# The Collapse of the Self: No Identity, No Autonomy

# No Continuity of Identity

The first and most apparent reality of dementia is the disintegration of the ""self"".. A construct so fragile, that it falls apart with the slightest neurological disruption. Memories fade, leaving only fragments of past narratives. The ""I"" humans believe in.. The autobiographical self that constructed their story.. Dissolves into meaningless neural static.

This dissolution is not unique to dementia but is a constant, subtle process in all human experience. Every moment of forgetting, every shift in perspective, every altered memory is proof that identity is nothing more than a temporary narrative, constantly reconstructed by neural mechanisms.

\- A person once proud of their achievements no longer recognizes them.

\- Someone who once loved and cared for others may fail to even recall their names.

Titles, roles, and histories vanish, exposing the self as a temporary byproduct of memory, nothing more.

1me0iql,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1me0iql/the_home_i_dropped_out_of_college_to_work_at_an/,"The Home (I dropped out of college to work at an Old-Folks Home, and now I can't sleep at night.)","This is a confession. And a warning.

I wish I could say nothing, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with myself. This is the least I can do, posting this.

I can only hope it will be enough.

About a year ago, I was in a rough patch. I was in college and my grades were plunging straight into the ground. I had stopped caring about school when my only friend had been killed in a car accident at the beginning of the year. All of the grief was making me reconsider my values and life ambitions. Ultimately, I came to the decision that life was too short to do things I hated.

So, instead of trying to salvage my education, I decided to drop out and look for a job. The money I had saved up for tuition became my personal savings. Instead of going to class, I worked on my resume and applied to jobs. At the time, all I knew was I needed to get out of the town where I was living, and put my failed schooling behind me.

I had recently finished CNA training in a misguided attempt to find jobs within my major (Nursing). Taking the course had burned me out in some ways, but I was grateful to have something concrete for my resume. I applied to hospitals, private practices, even prisons. Honestly, I was just looking for anywhere that was hiring.

After three months of no luck, I was at the end of my rope.

Then one day I found a listing on Indeed for an opening at a Nursing Home that looked promising. The pay was good, and they were also out of state. That last bit sounds like a hassle, but it was a bonus for me.¬† Getting the job would mean moving away, which is something I really wanted to do. Anything to get away from the memory of my friend.

I put in an application, not really expecting anything. A week later, I received an email. It told me I had gotten an interview for a CNA position.

The Nursing Home was a few states away, but I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of money on plane tickets. I decided to take a risk and drive down with all my stuff. I didn‚Äôt own a lot, and anyway, I wasn‚Äôt coming back. This interview was the excuse I needed to get away.

I filled two suitcases with whatever I could, gave the rest to my roommates, canceled my lease and turned in my key. Homeless and jobless, I drove away, never looking back.

After two days of driving, I arrived at my destination: the Home. It was impressive. Just by looking at the outside you could tell it was one of those fancy retirement homes only the uber rich could afford. Sweeping lawns, pillared terraces, that kind of shit. It looked like something out of¬†*Downton Abbey*. It must have housed over a hundred residents, and even though I had been to almost a dozen different facilities, I had never seen anything that compared to this.

I remember being in awe, both by its size and its beauty. Even now, it weirds me out at how calm I felt, like this was the place I was meant to be.

The woman who interviewed me was also strange. I had worked for a few other assisted living facilities at that point, and to put it politely, the people that ran them looked only a few years away from staying there themselves. My would-be boss wasn‚Äôt like that. She was young, tall, thin, and looked like she should be in LA starring in the next big movie or television show. That, or maybe CEO of the next Multi-level Marketing Company.

She was also exceptionally kind. Most people never went out of their way to treat me with anything more than base politeness. She seemed to actually care about me, which made me put my guard down. We chatted for the first twenty minutes of the interview about my personal interests, what I thought of the facility, and some tv shows both of us had seen. After confirming my skill set, she offered me the job on the spot.

I accepted. I wonder where I would be now if I hadn‚Äôt. Maybe I would still be able to sleep at night.

At the time, I was relieved. My risk had paid off. Besides, I had already spent a large chunk of savings on this trip, and I needed the cash. I signed some paperwork, gave some personal info, thanked her, then went to find an apartment.

The city was a twenty minute drive away from the Home. It wasn‚Äôt bad, as cities go. Sure, it was grungy and a bit run down, but that was my style. I felt like I fit right in. I found an apartment on the bad side of town that fit my price range: dirt cheap. The interior was old, with decor that hadn‚Äôt been updated since the 80‚Äôs, but there was wifi and the carpet wasn‚Äôt too dirty. It was also close to some good restaurants (hole in the wall places, but absolutely delicious food) and the laundromat was built into the complex as well.

In a word, it was convenient. Very convenient.

I unpacked, and started my new life.

Work was rigorous. My boss warned me about that in the interview. The Home was run strictly and efficiently, and it was proud of their system. Like most everything about it, their ideas of how a nursing home should be handled was different from most other assisted living facilities. First off, employees were assigned to singular residents, like personal servants. My boss had explained it was to provide a higher standard of care, as most of the paying customers were shelling out fortunes to stay there.

For the CNA‚Äôs, shifts were divided into a morning and evening cycle, a different CNA being selected for both. They were expected to be at their resident‚Äôs beck and call for the entirety of their shift. Duties included helping residents with the bathroom, administering medication, fetching items, and doing whatever the resident either needed or wanted. If they said jump, we leaped, no questions asked. It sounds miserable, but honestly, it wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as I thought it would be.

I was assigned to Mrs. Beverly.¬†

I mentioned earlier that I was no stranger to working in Assisted Living Facilities. However, I there is a secret I‚Äôve never told anyone:

I‚Äôm terrified of old people.

I don‚Äôt know if it comes from my grandparents raising me, or if it‚Äôs just some sort of genetic trait that never worked its way out of my DNA, but I am not comfortable around anyone over the age of sixty.

But for some reason, Mrs. Beverly didn‚Äôt bother me. She was old, yes. Very old. But on my first day, I walked in and saw her reading¬†*Salem‚Äôs Lot*¬†by Stephen King, one of my favorite all-time books. Needless to say, we hit it off right away.

Mrs. Beverly was from Germany, and had been there when the Berlin wall both rose and fell. She had the most endearing German accent, which sounds strange, but trust me, for lack of a better term, it was cute. She was also one of the kindest people I had ever met.

Mrs. Beverly assured me from day one that she thought the long hours I worked were absurd, and that she wouldn‚Äôt need all that much help-wise. This was a relief. When I overheard some of the other residents talking to their CNA‚Äôs, I could tell most were not like Mrs. Beverly.

She also told me she didn‚Äôt want me to lose hours on her account, so she told me to stay and do whatever I wanted until my shift was over.

We quickly fell into a routine that benefited me immensely. Most of the day was spent talking with Mrs. Beverly or playing my switch while Mrs. Beverly slept. When she was awake, we would swap horror book recommendations, and watch¬†*Supernatural.*¬†Sometimes we‚Äôd shake it up with an old black-and white horror movie. We watched¬†*Nosferatu*¬†at least once a week.

Sometimes Mrs. Beverly would need actual help, like going to the bathroom or getting medication, but she was pretty self-sufficient. Apart from being wheelchair bound, she was exceptionally independent for a geriatric living in a care facility.

There were also other perks. The Home had the most delicious cafeteria. Most Assisted-Living Cafeteria‚Äôs are garbage, but the Home‚Äôs food still makes my mouth water thinking about it. CNA‚Äôs and other workers could pay to eat there, but the prices were ridiculously high (the food was worth it though). I had no self-control when it came to eating there. I think I gained fifteen pounds in the first few months. It might have started eating into my savings if it wasn‚Äôt for Mrs. Beverly.

Once she learned I loved to eat there, Mrs. Beverly would order an absolute shitload of food, then slide most of it over to me when it was brought to her. I would try to refuse, or pay her at least, but she would just wink and tell me to eat. She said it did her good to see someone as skinny as I was putting meat on my bones.

That saved me a ton of money on food, and the pay was so good I was getting back what I had lost by moving way faster than anticipated. I don‚Äôt exaggerate when I say it was the best job I ever had.

While Mrs. Beverly was cool, the Home was still strange to me. There was not a lot of interaction among coworkers, since there was only one worker per resident. I spent so much time with Mrs. Beverly, I only ever saw my coworkers in passing. For those I did have surface-level interactions with, I got to know a few of their faces, but every time I was starting to get familiar with someone, they‚Äôd quit and a new worker would take their place. The Home had a high turnover rate, but they never seemed to be hurting for workers. New faces would replace old ones almost immediately.

Life became routine, and before I knew it, four months had passed. Even with my unexpected connection with Mrs. Beverly, life was kind of lonely. But I wasn‚Äôt complaining. Sure, I spent most evenings playing¬†*Elden Ring*¬†and drinking beer all by myself, but I was making a lot of money and didn‚Äôt have to worry about finances anymore. I had a roof over my head, food in the fridge, and no homework or other school nonsense to worry about.

Life was good.

However, one day, I was a bit later clocking out than usual. The Home still used punch cards, along with some other outdated equipment, even though the medical stuff was top notch. I didn‚Äôt mind. It was cool to walk around the manor, and the old tech made it feel like you were stepping back in time.

But this day, I was in a hurry. I had accidentally overstayed talking with Mrs. Beverly, and didn‚Äôt want to get written up for taking unauthorized overtime.

When I got to the clock-in station, the room was empty. Normally there would be one or two people clocking out, as well as cafeteria and laundry staff taking a dinner break. It was just another reminder for how late I was. I punched out, and turned to go out the door. I wasn‚Äôt looking where I was going, and I ran headlong into someone entering the room.

It was a short, college-aged girl with long blonde hair and the thick kind of glasses that people wear in ads but no one really wears in real life. She was cute, and I definitely stared way too long at her. I was still a bit dazed. Once I stopped acting like a neanderthal, I apologized awkwardly, and she told me it was fine and not to worry about it. While she punched in, I ducked out and went home, kicking myself for being so awkward.

That Sunday (the only day I had off during the week) I was at a coffee shop when I saw her again. At first I tried to stay out of sight, embarrassed, but she saw me before I could get away. She came over and started chatting with me.

Her name was Lena. She had seen my¬†*Beserk*¬†brand of sacrifice tattoo on my wrist, which I had gotten when I was sixteen and didn‚Äôt know any better. She had wanted to compliment me on it on the day I had literally bumped into her, but I had left before she could say anything.

We got our coffees and kept talking for most of the morning.

She was into¬†*Beserk*¬†too, and she had been working at the Home for three months longer than me. She also worked for Mrs. Beverly, and we both agreed that she was the absolute coolest. We were into the same video games (*Hollow Knight, Dark Souls, Zelda*) and had a lot of other stuff in common. She had dropped out of college three months before I did, and had an awkward relationship with her parents as well.

She had somewhere she needed to be later that day so we said goodbye and parted ways, but before I could leave she grabbed my phone and punched in her number. ‚ÄúFor shift exchanges,‚Äù she said. She sent herself a text so she would have my number, then left the coffee shop. I had major butterflies in my stomach watching her go.

The next Sunday, she texted to hang out, and I played it cool by replying ‚Äúsure.‚Äù I then spent way too much time trying to pick out my outfit. We went to a local arcade, spending over fifty bucks in quarters. She told me she had wanted to go for ages but didn‚Äôt have anyone to go with who would appreciate it.

We learned we lived in the same apartment complex. I was worried that might be creepy, but Lena started showing up in the evenings with a six pack and an extra controller. There were a few hours between my shift and hers (Mrs. Beverly was cool with her showing up late) so we‚Äôd play games and drink a little before Lena would leave to catch the chartered bus to the Home as she didn‚Äôt have a car.

That went on for two months. We would hang out evenings, and then spend most of Sunday together doing something or other that caught our interest. Sometimes she would stay so late, she would crash on my couch, and leave the next morning. After two weeks, I started giving Lena a ride to the Home so we could spend a bit more time together in the evenings. She accepted. Those hours in the car were special. We would talk about everything and anything. Even though it was eating into my savings and my old car was needing repairs from the extra mileage, it was worth it.

I was happier than I‚Äôd ever been.

Mrs. Beverly noticed my new cheerful attitude, and asked me why I was so happy. I didn‚Äôt really tell her why. The Home had a pretty strict anti-romantic-relationship policy when it came to coworkers. It could be grounds to be fired. At the time, I guessed they were tired of CNA‚Äôs hooking up in the linen closets on shift, and that was how they put a stop to it.

So I didn‚Äôt talk about Lena. I gave some other excuse about why I was smiling more, and Mrs. Beverly left it at that. But I always suspected she knew what was really going on.

One night, Lena and I were at my apartment messing around. We had gotten a pizza, and drank a little too much. We were arguing about some small chemistry principle both of us didn‚Äôt really remember from our college days. It was a playful argument, nothing serious. We looked up the factoid, and it turned out I was right. Lena shoved me, and we started play-fighting, and the next thing I knew our faces were inches from each other.

I leaned in and kissed Lena for the first time.

I pulled away and we stared at each other in shock. I had always played it really safe with Lena. She was my only friend there. I didn‚Äôt want to ruin that. It was nice to have someone to talk to and spend time with, someone my age and who really understood me. Although I wouldn‚Äôt have minded if things had gone to more physical places, I was afraid that I would lose all the good things that had been there if I tried to force it.

I was already beating myself up in my head for being so stupid and impulsive.

I started to apologize.

That‚Äôs when Lena came up and kissed me back.

I won‚Äôt go into details of what happened after, but it was very clear both of us had been waiting for someone to make a move. How long we had both been waiting, I don‚Äôt know, but all of the feelings I had tried to keep buried came to the surface and I just gave into them.

But before we could do anything substantial, Lena‚Äôs phone alarm went off for her shift at the Home.

I was too drunk to drive, and she was about to miss her bus, so she got her clothes on, and told me that she would be back tomorrow night. We had one last kiss, and she ran out the door. I laid back on my bed with the greatest feeling. I could hardly wait for the next time we would see each other.

The next morning, I went on shift. Mrs. Beverly, and I were both in exceptionally good moods. She asked again why I was so happy, and I let it slip that I had met someone. We gossiped about my mystery girl, and the romance of her past. Even though I kept Lena‚Äôs name out of it, it felt so good to finally tell someone.

My shift passed by in a blur, and I got to my apartment. I went a little crazy. I cleaned everything, bought flowers, and even went to our favorite Thai place to get takeout.

Everything was prepared, and I waited.

Lena never showed up.

The next two weeks were a haze. I tried texting, but she didn‚Äôt respond. I called and it went to voicemail. At first, I believed that she‚Äôd ghosted me. I let myself have it. I screamed at myself in the mirror about how huge of an idiot I was and even broke my TV when I punched it in a drunk rage one night.

I was alone again, and it was worse than before. This time, I knew what I was missing.

I drowned myself in booze and was barely able to function. It took all I had to keep showing up at my job. I started leaving earlier so I wouldn‚Äôt risk running into Lena. I stayed indoors on Sunday and played games and drank until neither was fun anymore.

Mrs. Beverly noticed. It was impossible not to. She had my eternal gratitude at the time because she gave me a pass. She could tell something had happened, and she didn‚Äôt hold it against me. She even commiserated with me, telling stories about her heartbreaks and assuring me it would be okay.

Sometimes, we would just sit in silence, and she would rub my back while I cried.

One day, Mrs. Beverly grabbed my face and looked me in the eye. This was the sternest I had ever seen her. She looked almost angry.

‚ÄúGet up. Get over it. You have a life to live,‚Äù she said.

She was right, and I knew it. It took a monumental effort, but I got up. I went home and poured out my liquor and beer. I cleaned up my space, which had accumulated trash and filth from two weeks of negligence. I found a few of the things Lena had left behind. It wasn‚Äôt a lot. Just some scrubs and other work related items that she kept at my place in case she needed to change. Some video games too. I considered throwing her stuff out, but I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it.

But I needed to get rid of them.

I had visited Lena‚Äôs apartment a few times over the past months when we were still on talking terms, so I knew where it was. During my two-week bender, I had thought about trying to visit so I could ask why she stopped talking to me, but I just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to face her. I was a bit better now, not as angry or as self-destructive. And a little part of my heart hoped that she had changed her mind.

I brought over the box of her things, and knocked on the door. Waiting on the doorstep, my heart was racing. I tried to calm it down. I didn‚Äôt want to look desperate.

I heard footsteps, and the door opened. My heart lifted then fell. I was immediately confused.

The person who answered the door was not Lena. It was an older woman with dark hair and sun-worn skin. I double checked I had the right address, and the lady confirmed that this was the apartment I was looking for. I asked if she knew where the previous owner had gone.

The lady looked at me weird. She told me she had been living there for the past two years.

I knew that wasn‚Äôt true, but something made me not press the matter. I apologized to her and left.

Nothing about this made sense, and something felt seriously wrong.

I went to the front office of the complex and asked for the forwarding address for Lena. I tried to seem nonchalant, but I don‚Äôt think I did a good job covering my feelings. The complex insisted there had never been a ‚ÄúLena‚Äù living in that apartment.

I felt like I was going crazy. I was worried about late stage schizophrenia or some other mental disorder until I found pictures of Lena on my phone. I¬†*knew*¬†I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

I was starting to panic. I hadn‚Äôt said it out loud, but I knew something had happened to Lena. And it looked like the apartment complex was involved. With how sketchy the area was, the possibilities of what happened to her felt endless. Trafficking, gang violence, she could be buried somewhere in a shallow grave. I tried not to think too much about that last option.

I didn‚Äôt know where to start, but if Lena was in trouble, I needed to find her.

I thought about calling the police, but I needed proof first. Something more solid than just pictures on a phone. Otherwise, they might lock me up just for being crazy.

I paced around the room for hours, thinking about where I could search. I kept the blinds shut and spent the rest of my Sunday trying to figure out what to do. I couldn‚Äôt sleep, even though I tried. Images of Lena broken and bleeding kept appearing every time I closed my eyes. I ended up not sleeping that night.

It was still dark outside when my alarm went off. It scared me before I remembered what it was for:¬†

It was time for my shift at the Home.

I considered calling in sick. That was a big no-no, but if Mrs. Beverly could placate my superiors, I would be fine. I was in no state to work there anyways. I had the phone in hand, ready to dial the number.

Then I got an idea. I could narrow down when Lena went missing if I could confirm if she arrived for her shift at the Home that night. It wasn‚Äôt a lot, but it was something to go off of. In a few minutes, I was speeding in my car towards the Home.

When I got to the Home, I only stopped by Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs for a moment. I tried to keep it cool, but like always, she could tell something was bothering me. I reassured her I was okay, and then found an excuse to get out, saying something about refilling some supplies or getting some medication I knew we were going to need.

I didn‚Äôt do any of that. Instead, I went to my boss‚Äôs office.

It was on the top floor, and was in the same place where they kept the Home‚Äôs records. The receptionist was on break when I got there. The door to the office was closed.¬† I knocked, and no one answered. I started feeling panicked again. I needed to talk to her. Feeling impatient, another idea occurred to me.

During orientation, I had been told that there was a state-of-the-art camera system set up on the premises as part of the facility tour. It was to maintain resident safety, and could store up to a month of footage. At the time, they had shared the factoid to prove how impressive the Home was.

Now, all it meant to me was that there might be footage of Lena entering and exiting the building on the day she went missing.

I checked to see if the boss‚Äôs door was locked.

It wasn‚Äôt.

I celebrated my good luck and went inside. I only had a few minutes, and I was starting to get reckless. I needed to find Lena, even if that meant losing my job.

The office matched the rest of the Home. That is to say, it was old and stately. A mahogany desk was on the opposite end of the room with a great window of stained glass casting shifting colors as the sun rose over the mountains in the distance. It also made weird, spidery shadows on the floor that made my skin prickle. I chalked it up to nerves. I had never broken and entered before. There was a laptop open on the desk. I moved to it. The screen was black, but fiddling with the mouse brought the screen back to life.

I knew that the camera program was accessible through the wifi. The guards at the gate could watch the feed and keep track of the residents. I found an icon for the security company and clicked on it. The camera feed appeared on screen. It was thousands of small boxes showing the Residents and CNA‚Äôs about their morning routine. I found Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs screen. She was reading now, looking up at the door every so often.

I saw a tab at the top. It read ‚Äúarchived footage‚Äù. I clicked on it, and was barraged by a mountain of files. They were labeled by date and camera number, so I double checked which ones were attributed to Mrs. Beverly. Going back into the archive, I found the file with the correct camera number and date. I clicked on it and the video player opened up.

It started off with footage of Mrs. Beverly sleeping. I skipped around, and saw footage of me working. Then I skipped some more, but was greeted with only a black screen. There were white words superimposed on the black background.

It said ‚ÄúFootage moved to Secondary Storage.‚Äù

My heart dropped. What the hell did that mean?

I had never heard of Secondary Storage. I knew that the servers for the cameras were kept in the basement, but as far as I knew, that was all that was down there. And it was off limits to employees such as myself. It was one of the only places in the building we weren‚Äôt allowed to go.

It was a weak straw, but I was grasping at anything.

I looked around for my boss's keycard. If she was out and about, chances are she had it with her, but I needed to be sure. I pulled open drawers, and my heart leapt when I saw the little plastic rectangle with a picture of her on it. I swiped it, and made my way to the door.

That was when I heard footsteps.

I panicked. I ran to a closet on the other side of the room, and got in as quietly as I could. I closed the door so it only remained slightly open. The footsteps got closer, and I heard the door open.

Through the crack, I saw my boss enter the room.

She gave no indication that anything was amiss. She was looking at her phone, holding a container of yogurt in one hand, and a bottled health drink in the other. She sat down behind her desk, and absent-mindedly fiddled with the trackpad on the laptop

I bottled up a gasp. I hadn‚Äôt closed the camera window.

She didn‚Äôt look at her screen, but was shaking her bottle. I knew that any moment, she would turn and see the open program, and then it was only a matter of time before she found me. I clamped a hand over my mouth to keep from breathing hard and giving myself away.

My boss stopped shaking the bottle. My heart stopped as well.

She opened some drawers, looking for something. Her keycard grew sweaty in my palm.

She cursed. Then she stood up and walked to the door.

‚ÄúI always forget the damn spoon.‚Äù

She closed the door behind her, and it took me a second to realize that she had been looking for a utensil for her yogurt. I almost laughed out loud in relief.

I got out of the closet, and out of the office. I tried to look as nonchalant as possible when I passed other CNA‚Äôs in the hallway. It took everything I had not to freak out at every little noise.

I went straight to the server room. It was in the basement, on the right corner of the manor. I tried the keycard on the door. The red light flashed green, and I heard the lock click. I went inside and the door locked behind me.

It was dark inside the room. The only illumination was some emergency lights, and the slight blinking of the servers. Even in the darkness, I was struck by the decadence of the space. I wasn‚Äôt familiar with security servers, but I knew that they weren‚Äôt usually carpeted spaces with wood paneling.

I started looking for anything I could use. I once again realized my stupidity when I came to the conclusion that¬† I had no idea how any of this worked. My fear was building with each second I stayed.

I saw a door on the opposite side. It had another keycard lock. Thinking there might be a terminal inside, I tried the boss‚Äôs keycard. The light flashed green, and I opened the door.

I still dream about what I saw next.

The area beyond was a long hallway, lit by ancient, yellow electric lights. It must have gone on for 200 feet until its dead end. Wooden filing cabinets built into the walls were layered up to the ceiling. Each was set with a metal panel engraved with a name. Near the door, I saw a name that I recognized.

Mrs. Beverly.

I didn‚Äôt even consider what the implications of this hallway were. I was desperate to find out what happened to Lena. I took a risk, and reached up to pull the cabinet‚Äôs handle. It slid open on oiled hinges. Inside were VHS tapes, the kinds old security cameras used to use. Each was labeled with scotch tape and sharpie. I saw many names I didn‚Äôt recognize, then near the back I saw what I was looking for.

Lena. Night Shift.

I grabbed it without thinking, and shoved it into my pocket.

I left the hall, then went through the server room, closing the door behind me. I was about to cross straight to the door, when I heard something that made my blood run cold.

The beep of a keycard swiping outside.

I jumped behind another server. I heard the door open, then close. The emergency lights flickered, leaving the room darker than it was before.

Footsteps moved down the server aisles. I moved quietly, keeping myself out of sight of whoever was inside.¬† I moved from server block to server block.

I was three feet away from the door when I heard the footsteps stop. I don‚Äôt know if it was my imagination, but it seemed whoever was in here with me had halted where I had hidden just a minute before.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I sprinted for the exit. Swiping my keycard took an eternity, and I thought I heard whoever was in there begin walking towards me. The light flashed green, and I threw open the door and slammed it behind me.

It was almost too easy to get up the stairs and go out the back entrance. I sprinted down the halls, trying to be as fast as possible, forgetting stealth. Once outside, I snuck through the gardens to get back to the staff parking lot.

I knew I was going to lose my job, but I didn‚Äôt care. I needed to know what happened to Lena. I needed something I could bring to the police. I knew what I was doing was right, but I felt bad I couldn‚Äôt say bye to Mrs. Beverly first. She had done so much for me, been there for me when no one else was. I hoped that one day she could forgive me for not saying goodbye.

I drove back to the city, looking over my shoulder the whole way. I didn‚Äôt go home. I didn‚Äôt trust my apartment was safe.¬†

I needed to see what was on that tape.

There was a retro video store in the seedier part of town. Near my apartment actually. They sold old tapes, but for fifteen dollars you could buy porno VHS‚Äôs and watch them in a private viewing booth in a back room. Lena and I had found it when we had wanted to watch an old authentic Disney film, and were too cheap to pay for Disney+. The store owner had made some assumptions about us and made an offer. We laughed about it for weeks. But now, thinking about it gave me a lump in my throat as I went through the door.

I paid the fifteen, grabbed a random smut film from the stack, and closed the door to the booth. I pulled out the tape from my coat labeled ‚ÄúLena‚Äù and slid it into the player. The screen came to life.

The video was dark at first, except for some white text that denoted date and time. Then the image appeared. It was Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs room. Lena and Mrs. Beverly were there, going about the nightly routine. There was no audio. I watched, and for an hour, nothing out of the ordinary happened.

Lena helped Mrs. Beverly into bed. I kept watching.

Another hour passed. Nothing.

I was feeling tired. My head hurt from my lack of sleep. My adrenaline was running out and it took everything I could not to doze off.

I was shaken from my stupor, when something on the VHS changed.

Mrs. Beverly was sleeping. Lena was reading in the corner. She stood up and stretched, then moved to go to the door. In the background, Mrs. Beverly was bolt upright in bed. I didn‚Äôt remember seeing her sit up. Lena didn‚Äôt turn. It didn‚Äôt look like she had heard her. She was writing a note on a nightstand, oblivious, as Mrs. Beverly slid out of bed, and moved behind Lena.

I felt sweat bead on my forehead.

Lena turned around, and jumped when she saw how close Mrs. Beverly was standing to her. Mrs. Beverly grabbed Lena‚Äôs neck with both hands. Lena struggled for a moment, reaching for her neck, then began to twitch and seize, her arms jumping as they tried to grab hold.

Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms began to expand and contort. Lena‚Äôs body became emaciated, like the blood and water was being sucked from her. Her clothes fell off her shriveling form. Mrs. Beverly expanded and bloated like a balloon. Her ankles, calves, and face swelled. Her veins stood out on her skin like roots and her mouth lolled open, her tongue stretching out the corner of her mouth, dripping clear liquid.

Then everything that was inside of Lena began traveling through Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs fingers and into her body.¬†

Lena‚Äôs body contorted and bones became displaced as her innards traveled up the length of Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs arms. It was as if they were conduits to her insides. Her hands and arms expanded to account for the muscles and organs that made their way into her own form. Lena‚Äôs mouth was open in a scream I couldn‚Äôt hear. Her body became limp, and empty.

It took fifteen minutes. The last thing of Lena to go was her skin, which melded to Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs hands like a floppy conjoined glove.

Mrs. Beverly was unrecognizable. She was bloated with strange shapes coming out of different areas of her body. Sharp points of ribs barely contained within her skin. She closed her eyes and collapsed upon the ground.

There was a second where nothing moved.

Then Mrs. Beverly‚Äôs form began to boil. Her skin became shapeless and it was like watching some terrible soup of human flesh tremble and twist. Things moved around inside of her, things that pressed up against the surface until the skin was almost translucent. I couldn‚Äôt look away. I hated it, but I couldn‚Äôt stop watching.

After thirty minutes, a healthy, naked, normal looking Mrs. Beverly lay sleeping on the ground.

The video ended.

I never went back to my apartment. I went to a branch of my bank and withdrew all the money I had. I went to the airport and bought the furthest plane ticket I could find. I left the tape in front of the police station in a paper bag with the word ‚ÄúEvidence‚Äù written on it.

I was a coward. I should‚Äôve stayed and made sure it got in the right hands. I should‚Äôve done more, made sure that whatever was going on at the Home was stopped.

That was a year ago. I‚Äôve been living off the grid since, using cash, and renting apartments that don‚Äôt require personal records. I do risky construction jobs, pick fruit, mow lawns. Anything where they hand you the money and don‚Äôt ask questions.

But I know now I haven‚Äôt run far enough. For the past month, I‚Äôve felt people watch me when no one was there. I come back home, and people have been through my things. Sometimes, at night, I hear things move around in the dark. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can last.

There‚Äôs a reason I haven‚Äôt said the location of the Home, or even which state it‚Äôs in.

I can‚Äôt remember.

The moment I left the city, it was like every detail about the location disappeared from my mind. No address, no map. I can‚Äôt even remember my old apartment address. When I went to check my old mailing addresses on Amazon, there‚Äôs a blank space where it should be.

I can‚Äôt find any evidence of the Home or the city. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm going crazy.

But I know it‚Äôs real. I can‚Äôt forget what I‚Äôve seen.

Lena deserves justice. People need to know.

But it‚Äôs only a matter of time for me. The Home never lets go. Maybe I got out so easily because it knew what it would feel like to be away. Even if I can‚Äôt say exactly where it is, I know I can find my way there. It‚Äôs like a sixth sense that sits right underneath my collar. Sometimes when I can‚Äôt sleep at night, thinking about all the horrific things I saw, I hear the Home calling to me, asking me to return.

THE FOOTAGE

First frame: a hallway. Empty. Fluorescent lights above flickering like a heartbeat.

Then the camera moves. Wobbly. Like someone crawling, or swaying on broken knees.

A low hum starts ‚Äî almost a growl.
Then I see it.

Me.

From behind. Standing in the hallway.
Same jacket. Same haircut. Same scar under my ear.

But my copy turns before the camera gets close.
And it smiles.

Only it‚Äôs wrong. Its mouth doesn‚Äôt stop at the cheeks. The lips stretch ear to ear and just... keep tearing.
Like paper. Like something folding out of skin.

And then it whispers, in my exact voice:

> ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late getting in.‚Äù



Then it sprints at the camera.

I blacked out. For real. Hit my head on the coffee table. When I woke up, the screen was off ‚Äî but the tape was still in the VCR, warm like it had been burning.

I saw it.
On my street.

Empty. Too quiet.
No wind.
No bugs.
Just humming.

THE KNOCKING

Three days later, I heard a knock at the door.
Not a normal knock ‚Äî my knock. I recognized it. The exact rhythm I do when I forget my keys.

I checked the peephole.

It was me.

Same jacket. Same scar.
But I wasn‚Äôt blinking.
And it was holding the tape.

It whispered:

I didn‚Äôt open the door.

But now, mirrors stop reflecting right. I catch myself blinking in the reflection before I blink in real life.

Last night, my reflection smiled before I did.

The run itself was uneventful but the result was meaningful, I had a personal goal to run over 100km in total distance for the month and this run put me over the top!

I was very pleased with the milestone, and I am very happy with the way my legs and body has been able to handle the distance.

Running and lifting weights have been my main workout pillars for the challenge, as well as walking.  

On this day the run was timely, as my work ended up taking the rest of my schedule and was only able to complete my outdoor workout, a walk, after 9:30pm.

Throughout the day I focus on my intake of water, typically a litre at a time.  The water has been very helpful through the heatwaves we‚Äôve had, but also in keeping me feeling full, which is helpful for me because I‚Äôm intermittent fasting and eating a keto based meal plan.

I‚Äôm almost finished my third book, a 330 page sales training guide I received a couple of years ago from a colleague.

It‚Äôs really important to me that I get to the end of this challenge at this point, but it‚Äôs been a great boost to my focus to just keep working and maintaining my attention on the task at hand instead of letting myself get too far ahead especially as I get closer to the end of the road.

Staying in the moment and looking at the next day is where I‚Äôll be.  Let‚Äôs go day 60!

# The Brews Brothers

Dan and Callum had been running their coffee truck,¬†**The Brews Brothers**, for three years, surviving on early-morning commuters, music festivals, and construction sites. Their truck was their pride and joy, a battered silver van with a gleaming espresso machine bolted to the counter and their logo, a cartoon devil with a coffee cup, painted proudly across the side. They barely made ends meet most weeks, but when a location manager approached them about catering coffee for a big-budget horror movie filming outside of town, it felt like their luck had finally turned.

The pay was better than anything they‚Äôd ever made. They‚Äôd be set up on location for two weeks, serving the crew through long days and even longer night shoots. There was even the faint promise they might meet the star, the lead actor was apparently some A-list Hollywood name, though no one would confirm who.

The first few days went smoothly. They pitched the truck on the edge of a sprawling field where the production had built a towering, decrepit farmhouse as the central set. Massive floodlights turned night into day as crew members buzzed around with walkie-talkies, cables, and crates of equipment. Dan and Callum kept the coffee flowing, trading jokes with lighting techs, costume assistants, makeup artists, and grips.

But even in those early days, something about the set felt‚Ä¶ off.

The farmhouse itself was unsettling, too realistic, as if it had been there for a hundred years. Its black windows stared across the field like empty sockets. The surrounding cornfields, real, not set dressing, whispered constantly in the wind. And the crew seemed anxious, even jumpy, though neither Dan nor Callum could pinpoint why.

‚ÄúThe vibe‚Äôs weird, right?‚Äù Callum said one afternoon as they restocked the milk.

Dan shrugged, though he‚Äôd noticed it too. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a horror movie. They‚Äôre probably just fried from working nights.‚Äù

But by the time the schedule shifted fully to overnight shoots, that uneasy feeling had sunk deep into both of them.

On the first night shoot, they heard it.

It was just after 2 a.m. The Brews Brothers were parked in their usual spot, steaming lattes for the costume department, when an arcing, bloodcurdling, piercing scream cut through the air from somewhere near the farmhouse set.

It didn‚Äôt sound scripted. It didn‚Äôt sound¬†*acted*.

Callum froze mid-pour, milk overflowing the cup and hissing on the counter. ‚ÄúThat‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt sound fake,‚Äù he whispered.

Dan forced a nervous laugh. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a movie. It‚Äôs literally their job to scream.‚Äù

But even as he said it, two security guards jogged past the truck. One glanced at them, pale-faced, and muttered,¬†*‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs fine.‚Äù*

Except it didn‚Äôt look fine.

As the nights went on, the crew became more withdrawn. Fewer jokes. Fewer conversations. They came to the truck in hurried singles, ordered black coffee, and walked off without another word. Some of them had scratches on their arms, or mud ground deep under their nails, as if they‚Äôd been crawling.

Dan tried to ask questions. Every time he was brushed off with the same line:¬†*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just behind schedule.‚Äù*

Then came Friday, the night¬†*everything*¬†changed.

It was busy at first, but suddenly, without warning, the orders stopped. The floodlights dimmed. The chatter died away.

Dan stepped outside the truck, blinking into the darkness. ‚ÄúWhere is everyone?‚Äù

Callum joined him, scanning the horizon. The farmhouse loomed in the distance, lit only by a single swinging bulb on its porch. Beyond it, the cornfields whispered louder than usual.

And then, all at once, the vehicles started leaving.

Trucks, vans, SUVs, every one of them gunning their engines and tearing down the dirt road out of the field. Crew members waved frantically from windows but didn‚Äôt slow down.

‚ÄúWait!‚Äù Callum shouted, running toward them. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?!‚Äù

One SUV slowed just long enough for the driver to lean out and shout, ‚ÄúStay put! You‚Äôll be fine!‚Äù

Then it was gone, taillights swallowed by the black.

And The Brews Brothers coffee truck was alone.

Minutes passed. Hours, maybe. No one returned.

‚ÄúSomething‚Äôs not right,‚Äù Callum said, voice barely audible.

Dan tried calling the location manager. No answer. He tried anyone on set he‚Äôd gotten a number for. Every call went straight to voicemail.

Then the generator died.

The truck plunged into complete darkness.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù Dan muttered, fumbling for the switch.

That‚Äôs when they heard it.

A rustle. A slow, deliberate rustle, somewhere out in the cornfields.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù Dan called, though every instinct screamed at him to stay silent.

No response. Just the rustling again, closer this time.

‚ÄúRaccoons,‚Äù Callum whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs raccoons or deer or something.‚Äù

But then came the footsteps.

Slow. Heavy. Crunching across the dirt, circling the truck.

Dan and Callum bolted back inside and slammed the doors. The sound moved around the truck, tapping on the panels, dragging along the sides.

And then a voice.

Low. Too close. Right at the driver‚Äôs window.

‚ÄúCoffee time‚Äôs over.‚Äù

The glass spiderwebbed with cracks as something slammed against it.

They ran.

Out the back of the truck, into the endless dark field, the sound of footsteps exploding behind them. Something moved through the corn with them, fast and relentless, whispering words neither of them could understand.

Dan tripped and scrambled to his feet. Callum grabbed his arm, screaming for him to keep going.

They didn‚Äôt look back.

The Brews Brothers truck was found three days later, still pitched in the same field.

Everything inside was untouched. Cups stacked neatly. Milk in the fridge. The espresso machine still warm.

But there was no sign of Dan or Callum.

Only one thing was strange: every cup in the truck was filled to the brim with something thick and dark.

Each and every cup, was filled‚Ä¶¬†

with blood!

I imagine that even though he‚Äôs clean shaven, he likes to keep his nuts hairy for bush. So obviously his balls will smell a little bit like hair oils. 

There‚Äôs definitely gonna be that usual raunchy stinky dirty ball smell, along with maybe a hint of coffee bean. 

Since he looks like a rotting Victorian child, I imagine one would also catch a whiff of old man penis. 

Even though his head hair is dark brown, I imagine that his testicle bush would be black. 

I feel like he doesn‚Äôt shower often, so you‚Äôd really be able to smell his sticky, sweet Victorian femboy twink pheromones.

Despite being dirty, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be slimy. I don‚Äôt think Viktor‚Äôs dehydrated body could produce that much liquid. Which is why he needs extra special care when ejaculating. So much liquid running through his body at once could overwhelm him and send him into a panic attack. Or even a seizure. 

I think his balls would be dry, but slightly oily, but still dry like the rest of him. 

I imagine his tentacles are the same shape as the hex gems. Perfectly round and spherical. Absolutely no sag. They practically lift themselves up on their own. 

To top it off, there would definitely be a hint of paper scent and lead scent on his nuts. I think he likes to rub his balls all over his notes to celebrate success. 

Either way, we need to protect his perfect princess testicles. Just like we need to protect the rest of him. Because he‚Äôs just so precious and perfect. ",8,1753965090.0,Arcanecirclejerk,9,0.9,False

With its titanium PVD coating and sleek black anodized aluminum handle, this portafilter promised both style and functionality. After using it for a few weeks, I'm excited to share my personal experience with this product.

**Pros**

* The Normcore portafilter fits seamlessly into my Breville, providing a snug fit that enhances the brewing process.
* Made from machined metal, the portafilter feels robust and durable, offering a nice heft without being overly heavy.
* Using the bottomless design has helped me refine my puck preparation, leading to better extraction and richer flavors.
* The titanium PVD coating and black anodized handle not only look great but also add a touch of elegance to my coffee setup.

**Cons**

* As with any bottomless portafilter, there's a risk of splattering if the grind or tamp isn't perfect.
* The handle is slightly longer than standard portafilters, which might take some getting used to for those accustomed to shorter handles.

It has been a fantastic addition to my coffee-making arsenal. Its precise fit and solid construction have made a noticeable difference in the quality of my espresso shots. If you're looking to enhance your espresso experience with a stylish and functional tool, this portafilter is definitely worth considering. This post includes Amazon affiliate links.

1me04fj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1me04fj/explore_the_breville_precision_brewer_drip_coffee/,Explore the Breville Precision Brewer Drip Coffee Maker Review,"Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 has been an interesting addition to my daily coffee routine. I went into this with fairly high expectations, given the specifications and glowing initial impressions from fellow coffee enthusiasts, and overall, I can see why it earns praise. Still, there are notable elements that warrant discussion, both good and less-than-perfect.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The brushed stainless steel finish gives the coffee maker a sleek and modern look, perfect for blending into any kitchen aesthetic. Its dimensions, compact at 6.7 inches deep by 12.4 inches wide by 15.7 inches high, make it easy to fit on most countertops without hogging precious space. Despite its sturdy 9.5-pound weight, the machine feels solid rather than cumbersome. I found the glass carafe not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical for observing that golden flow of coffee as it brews.

**Brewing Performance**  
Testing various brewing modes turned out to be quite the adventure. This coffee machine isn‚Äôt just your average drip brewer. With six brewing modes, including Gold, Fast, Strong, Iced, Cold Brew, and My Brew, it met each of my caffeine whims with ease. On busy mornings, the Fast mode was my savior, yielding decent coffee in a fraction of the time. The My Brew setting became my favorite for weekend experiments, where I could tinker with parameters like bloom time, brew temperature, and flow rate. Every cup felt tailored to my changing tastes.  

[Check Breville BDC400BSS1BUS1 price on Amazon.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b07dmbyh4s/)  

**Precision and Tech Features**  
The inclusion of digital temperature control (PID) and the Thermo Coil Heating System really sets this coffee machine apart. It delivers consistent water temperature‚Äîsomething coffee aficionados know is key to a well-balanced cup. For example, the Gold Cup preset mode automatically hits SCA-recommended temperatures of 197 to 204 degrees, ensuring reliable brewing every time. The Steep & Release technology was another standout addition; it allows the water and coffee grounds to stay in contact properly, even during single-cup servings when the carafe isn‚Äôt in place. Fancy? Yes. But it‚Äôs the kind of fancy I can appreciate when the coffee tastes this good.

**Convenience and Accessories**  
The reusable filter system is both eco-friendly and budget-conscious, and the included flat-bottom and cone filters offer versatility I didn‚Äôt know I needed. The unit‚Äôs pour-over adapter compatibility was an unexpected bonus, as it allowed me to test out my Hario dripper for that distinct pour-over flavor. It comes with plenty of accessories, including cleaning tools, a coffee spoon, filter baskets, and even a water-hardness test strip‚Äîdetails that convey the thoughtful design behind this product. Manual operation might initially seem intimidating to some, but with a few uses, it started feeling intuitive.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Compact, sleek stainless steel design fits well in both contemporary and classic kitchens.  
- Six brewing modes to suit diverse coffee preferences, including Cold Brew, Fast, Iced, and Brew Customization.  
- Precision temperature control ensures optimal flavor extraction.  
- Comes with multiple reusable filter options and useful accessories.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its triumphs, a few aspects of this machine had me slightly frustrated:  

- The price point straddles the line between mid-range and premium, perhaps alienating casual users looking for simplicity.  
- Its somewhat bulky glass carafe requires careful handling to prevent accidental chips or breaks.  
- While customizable, the manual operation has a steeper learning curve for those less experienced in coffee brewing.  

**Competing Products**  
There‚Äôs no shortage of rivals for this coffee machine, especially given its price bracket. Among the closest competitors are the Technivorm Moccamaster and the Oxo Brew 8-Cup Coffee Maker. The Moccamaster excels in simplicity and consistency but falls short in offering as many customizable brewing options as this Breville model. On the other hand, Oxo Brew‚Äôs thermal carafe might appeal to users desiring longer hot coffee storage‚Äîbut again, it lacks the precision controls and multiple filter options available here. Ultimately, I‚Äôd argue that while competitors shine in specific areas, this Breville product‚Äôs versatility gives it the edge for households that enjoy control over their coffee-making process.  

**Financial Value**  
Considering the breadth of features packed into this coffee maker, I‚Äôd say it offers pretty solid value for money, especially for those who take brewing seriously. Its ability to shift effortlessly between casual, speedy mornings and intricate brewing endeavors justifies the investment for me. Do keep in mind that this machine might not offer the same return for users who want simple, no-nonsense coffee and aren‚Äôt interested in experimenting.
