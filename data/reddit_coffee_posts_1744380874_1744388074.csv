1jwto8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jwto8w/time_looped_chapter_91/,Time Looped (Chapter 91),"A dozen Wills ran out of the coffee shop, charging at the man en masse. Several of them threw knives at their target while just as many leaped over the crashed cars in front, striking at him with various weapons.

 

**DEATH SPIRAL**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Slash wound inflicted**

 

One circular slash with the spear was enough to shatter all the mirror copies along with the knives they had thrown. The man hardly put any effort into it, following up his action with a dash forward. His target wasn’t Will, though, but Helen.

“Hel!” Will shouted as he rushed to intercept the attacker. 

Having seen the reach of the enemy’s spear, Will drew the knight’s sword from his inventory; it was just as long and a lot more deadly. One good bash was all he needed to put the man on the defensive.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

 

The weapons clashed, yet the force of the attack wasn’t enough to push the man back even a step. Will was just about to leap away and have another go when the spear suddenly spun around. It was a lot faster than he had seen to the point that his body wasn’t able to react.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

Will was back in front of the school. The last thing he remembered was the spiral impaling him midair. Driven by instinct, he gripped his stomach, still feeling echoes of the pain. It was strange and also embarrassing, judging by the reaction of the people in the nearby vicinity.

“Nice moves, weirdo,” Jess said with a healthy dose of sarcasm.

“Just ignore him,” Ely added, pulling her friend forward.

Breathing heavily, Will’s only response was to look at his hands to check whether there wasn’t blood on them. Thankfully, everything seemed fine.

*Get it together!* He told himself. 

Getting killed so easily was terrifying, but it had happened in the previous loop. This was a fresh start and—

A spear split the air, pinning Will to the entrance of his school.

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

“What the heck?!” Will looked round in panic.

His mind was in shock, unable to register what had happened. The boy could remember being killed by the man in the spear two loops ago, but what had occurred after that? There was no way he could have been attacked again so fast, was there? It had been less than five seconds since the start of the loop. Not even Alex could cross the distance so fast.

Will’s phone pinged. The boy took it out and saw he had received a message from Helen. All it said was **Run!**

 

**Restarting eternity.**

 

A fresh bout of pain swept through Will as he was brought to the start of a new loop. This time, the confusion lasted a lot less. A second after realizing he was in a new loop, Will rushed towards the school entrance. Part of him expected for a spear to pin him in the back as he ran. To his relief that didn’t happen.

“A reminder to all students,” an announcement echoed through the hall. “We remind you to take care of your physical and mental health. There is no shame in seeking help. The school counselor’s door is open at all times. With midterms approaching—“

“Helen!” Will shouted as he ran.

She was further in, so there was a good chance she was safe. That said, it couldn’t be for much longer. The spearman had openly attacked the school, so everyone from Will’s party was at risk.

Passing through the boy’s bathroom, Will tapped his class mirror, then rushed out again.

“Stone!” the coach yelled. “What do you think you’re—“

A strong whack on the head made him stop mid-sentence. 

“Come on!” Helen said, holding a fire extinguisher. “Nurse’s office.” She tossed it onto the floor.

All around, dozens of people had taken out their phones, recording what just had happened in horror and amusement. It wasn’t every day that the coach got hit on the head by an extinguisher, and by a girl, no less.

Everyone quickly moved to the sides, letting Will and Helen rush by. None of them wanted to get involved, and most were curious what chaos would follow.

“What’s going on?” Will asked as they ran towards the nurse’s office.

“You missed a lot,” Helen replied. “We wrecked half the street after you were killed. Five police cars showed up.”

Definitely quite a fight. Will wasn’t sure what he regretted more: not being able to see it, or getting killed in such a pathetic way in front of her.

“My loop ended before I could do anything,” she continued. “Then he showed up here.”

“What does he want? Is this some challenge?”

“I’ve no idea. Maybe—“

A spear flew down the school hallway, aimed at the pair. With their levels being so low, there was nothing stopping it from piercing through the two of them. That was until a shadow sprung to life, leaping from a doorway corner and grabbing the shaft with its teeth again.

The spear changed trajectory, sliding along a wall, safely away from Will and Helen.

Spotting that, Helen punched the closest classroom door.

 

**KNIGHT’s BASH**

**Damage increased by 500%**

**Door shattered**

 

The door flew in, as screams and yells came from the entrance. No doubt the spearman had entered the school and wasn’t shy about killing anyone in his path.

“In here!” Helen turned into the classroom. Will immediately followed.

“He’s quick.” Will remained close to the former doorway, ready to react should the need arise. Fortunately, with it being still early, there was no one else in the classroom, eliminating the need for explanations.

“Let’s hope Jace stays where he is this time,” Helen said as she typed on her phone. “Seen Alex?”

“No. He’s been quiet for a while.” Will drew his poison dagger from his mirror fragment. “What about our allies?”

“I sent the acrobat a message last loop. She still hasn't answered.” The girl put the phone away. “What’s that shadow skill you got? It stopped the spear at the coffee shop, too.”

“Shadow wolf,” Will replied. “I got it by completing the wolf challenge.”

“On your own?” Helen sounded impressed. “I tried a few times but couldn’t get past wave seven.”

*It only works if you have multiple skills,* Will thought. This was a good time to tell her about his copycat skill as well. She had seen him use mirror copies, so there was no denying it.

The boy checked the time. Eight minutes remained until the end of the standard loop. The way things were going, he wasn’t sure they’d last that long.

“How fast is he?” he asked.

“That’s not the problem. He has some skill that lets him fight from a distance. It’s not as bad as the archer, but I don’t think we could escape. I tried that last loop and he still got me.”

Running was out of the question, and so was fighting, it seemed.

Still, the question that kept bothering Will was why would someone target them to such an extent. This wasn’t the contest phase, so it didn’t matter how many times they got killed. The loop would just restart and everything would continue as normal. It wasn’t even plausible that the spearman had been tasked to prevent them from starting a particular challenge. All the easy ones had been completed for some time; at this point, Will and the others were only going after leftovers.

“It must be because of the alliance,” Will said. “There’s no other reason.”

“If that were true, our allies would have swooped in to help. They didn’t make an offer just to ignore us. It defeats the purpose.”

“Why’s he after us, then?”

The moment Will asked the question, a possible answer popped up in his mind. There was someone who wanted something from them—or rather from Will, specifically. Placing them in a predicament that required his help was just the sort of thing he’d do.

*Danny, you piece of shit,* Will thought to himself.

It was just the ex-rogue’s style to sick someone after Will’s entire party just to prove a point; it couldn’t be a coincidence that the spearman had gone on a rampage so soon after their latest conversation. The message was clear: either Will would agree to Danny’s demands or he won’t be able to do anything in eternity ever again, or at least for a substantial period of time.

“I don’t hear him,” Will said. “Move away from the windows.”

“That won’t keep us safe,” Helen said, but did as Will suggested. “We need a plan.”

If Jace was with them, maybe they could come up with something. As things stood, Will didn’t like their chances. He had proved to be at a disadvantage as far as the spearman went. If Helen was to be believed, she had also failed to kill him, although had survived a lot longer.

“I think we should restart,” Will said.

“A new loop?”

“Go directly for Jace. I’ll get my class and try to gain a few levels in town.”

“He can’t be distracted that easily.” The girl frowned.

“I know. I just want to see who his target is. If he goes after me, it means I am. If he goes after you…”

“What if he’s after both of us?”

“Then we force him to make a choice and work on that.” Will took a deep breath. “Ready?”

Helen nodded.

Counting to three, Will jumped out into the corridor. His expectation was to instantly see a spear flying his way, and he was right.

The weapon seemed to let out a faint sound as it flew in the direction of the boy’s head. Behind it, the man was already drawing another weapon from his mirror fragment.

An inch before the spear hit his nose, the entire wall burst, blocking the view between the two. The weapon was thrust away before it could cause any harm. Instead, Will felt someone grab him by the arm.

“Don’t be reckless!” A familiar voice ordered, as the boy was pulled out of the corridor and back into the room he had jumped out from.

“Spenser?” Will managed to ask.

There could be no doubt. The man wore the exact same business suit he had during the goblin adventure. Given the properties of eternity, everyone was cursed, being stuck with the clothes they had at the moment of joining.

Seeing someone new appear, Helen pointed her sword in his direction. Glares were exchanged.

“It’s alright,” the man said, paying more attention to the corridor than to either of the children. “I’m from the alliance.”

Helen’s resolve remained for a few moments more, after which she moved the tip of her weapon in the direction of the hole where the classroom door used to be.

“And him?” she asked.

“Obviously not,” he said. “I doubt he’ll keep this up now that I’m here, but you never know. How much left till the end of your loops?”

Will checked the time.

“Six minutes,” he said.

“Shit. Can you extend it?”

“I don’t know.” Will glanced at Helen.

Technically, he could extend it if he got into a fight with her or Spenser. The same wasn’t true for the girl, though. While it was true that he didn’t know all the ways she had to extend her loop, he couldn’t think of anything knightly in the present circumstances.

“Yes, but not here,” she replied. “I need to be outside.”

“Alright.” Spenser let go of Will, then performed a punch in the direction of the windows.

 

**DEVASTATING STRIKE**

**Damage increased 1000%**

**Wall shattered**

 

The wall all but exploded, opening a view of the city outside. The chaos and panic that had started with the spearman going into a killing spree now doubled. Already, sirens could be heard approaching from the distance.

“Go!” Spenser shouted.

“What about the others?” Will asked.

“We’d be lucky if they sent more to deal with you.” The businessman grunted. “The main thing now is to extend your loop. Everything else can wait.”

So, Bbno$ finally revealed the winner of the ""Meant to Be"" art cover contest on 4/6/25 and changed the cover on streaming platforms. Honestly, it feels a bit off for him. The old cover was just a photo of him leaning by a window sipping coffee, and that felt way more like him. If you watch the music video, the old cover has a vibe that just fits better with his style.

The new cover doesn’t really match the vibe of his music; it feels more suited for a different song. I respect the talent that went into the new artwork, but when I think of Bbno$, I expect something that really captures his unique energy.

#Boosted 2 Barista Prepared Drinks

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying). 

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a **free cake** on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

* Download the Caffè Nero app: **https://nero.app.link/8j07ZvbRhSb**
* **Register** an account.
* **Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying**.
* **Your free drink voucher should appear in the app**. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”. 
* To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to **scan the voucher QR code**.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once **9 stamps** have been awarded you will automatically receive a **voucher** for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I will try my best to be concise. Also, sorry if formatting is weird I'm on mobile.

Okay, so some backstory, my brother (35M), is the favorite child. My mother (55F) always took more photos of him, always went to his games/plays/events/etc but never any others. If he got in trouble for anything, for example fighting at school and getting suspended, his punishments never lasted more than an hour. Meanwhile I, (31F) would be screamed at, cussed at, hit with shoes/belts/spoons if I so much as breathed the wrong way.

He has been married to his wife (35F) for 18 years. I love my SIL more than anything. She is sweet, funny, kind, and always the first to help when you're in need. Her biggest downside has always been that she isn't very money smart but my brother is and I thought they worked well together when it came to balancing each other. They bought a house, got a dog, and were trying to have a baby all while still saving a significant amount.

My brother says they started fighting a lot cause he wanted to save money and do IVF but my SIL really wanted a baby without all that. Admittedly, while they never struggled to get pregnant their babies were never healthy enough to survive after birth and their last 3 pregnancies ended with infant loss. Well, he got her pregnant again anyways and the baby is perfectly healthy. The day she told my brother she is pregnant he asked for a divorce and confessed he cheated with a co-worker (23F).

The biggest reason why I am so angry about this isn't because of how much love I have for my SIL but more so because my brother claims that he didn't know he even wanted a divorce until he cheated on his wife and realized he didn't feel guilty about it. But he also has confessed to our mother that he actively pursued a relationship with his co-worker. His co-worker is also very aware that he is married and has even met his wife. In fact, she regularly shops at the store that my sister-in-law works at and had made it a point to approach her at work prior to my SIL finding out about the affair.

Now on to what caused me cut off my family, I went to visit my SIL for the first time in a while. She was giving me a coffee table as her and my brother are selling their house (they are not divorcing, my brother will not file) and I decided I would also visit with her. Just to see how she was doing, check on her pregnancy and just all around, make sure that she is okay. Towards the end of my visit, my brother and my mother both started calling me excessively, texting me that I had to call them back right now and I hadn't even left her house yet. Once we got in the car and started driving away. My brother and mother started calling again. Several times back-to-back, and we finally answered And that's when they started getting angry at me.

Apparently my SIL told my brother she didn't want to go shopping after their 20 week appointment the next day and my brother thought it was my fault. My SIL does not know that my brother's mistress is pregnant and that they are only 4 weeks apart. He assumed I told her and when I responded that I had not told her anything he called me a liar and screamed and cursed at me. I ended up yelling back and told him to ""go f@!& himself"". My mother called immediately after and demanded to know what I told my SIL and when I told her the same thing I told my brother she too called me a liar and yelled at me.

I ended up blocking them both. My mother got so angry she couldn't get a hold of me she demanded I get my own insurance on my car (she bought it for me and is the only person on the title, it is still being financed by the dealership. I pay the car payment directly and send her money for the insurance), and that I add her back to Life360 so she knew where HER car was at all times. She also said my BF (30M) is not allowed to drive it (he doesn't unless I'm in the car with him). She texted my boyfriend all of that since she couldn't get to me. I ended up taking the car to her house and dropped it off with the keys and told her to do what she wants with it since she wanted to know where it was at all times.

She ended up texting my BF that we are both ""pieces of shit"" And to never contact her again. This was after I unblocked her long enough to text her that I would still make the payments but since she wanted to know where the car was she could just have it. I made a promise to pay it and I intended to keep that promise but now I don't think I should.

This whole time my mother has been hosting my brother's mistress at her house after my brother moved in with her and she keeps protecting him as much as she can. She even gaslights my SIL to make her think the divorce and affair are her fault. And she tries to blame me for my brother and SIL 'fighting'. I am so tempted to go nuclear.

With everything going on I could get my brother, mother, and the mistress fired from their jobs and could even get my parents evicted from their home since they live in a 55+ community and my brother is not on the lease. His staying there goes against their lease agreement and they could be evicted if the landlords/property management company finds out. I won't get them evicted or my mother fired but I wonder if my brother and his mistress should suffer consequences especially since my brother is the mistresses direct supervisor.

I also wonder if IATAH for cutting everyone except my SIL off after all of this.

I'm not sure how long ago, but maybe 24 hours, I took a whole bunch of nortriptyline and celecoxib (because I know it increases the level of TCAs) trying to end my life. I woke up I think around six hours post ingestion feeling absolutely awful with my vision very blurry , and needed to go the toilet, so I tried to get out of bed, but my legs were so weak I just fell on the floor. I tried to stand up but kept just falling over, so I crawled to the toilet.

On the way back, I tried to stand up again, but staggered sideways and fell over backwards. On the way down, I hit the back of my head on the corner of a low wooden coffee table. I stayed lying where I landed for a bit and kind of just fell asleep again. I woke up some time later and crawled to bed. I don't know how long I slept for, but I woke up again about an hour ago. I can stand but not walk very well. 

Here is the part I need advice about. I saw myself in the mirror and I had really dark bruising under both eyes. I looked again just now, and the bruising had worsened rapidly.

My heart is also racing uncomfortably and have what feels like a fever.

I'm going to go ahead and assume that it was a failed attempt. 

I'm assuming that the bruising is related to the head knock rather than the overdose, but I'm worried that if I go to hospital for this I might be involuntary committed if I tell them the truth about what actually happened. I could lie though. I live rurally by myself, and i don't have anyone to take me right now.  It's also 3am, and I really just want to go back to sleep.

## Why Breville Descaling is non-Negotiable for Optimal Performance

Before we dive into the how-to, let's understand the *why*. Hard water, the culprit behind scale buildup, is a common issue in many households and businesses. As water heats up inside your Breville espresso descaling, minerals like calcium and magnesium precipitate out, forming a hard, chalky deposit called scale.

Here's why scale buildup is bad news for your beloved Breville:

*   **Reduced Heating Efficiency:** Scale acts as an insulator, forcing your machine to work harder and longer to reach the optimal brewing temperature.This leads to increased energy consumption and potentially shortens the lifespan of your heating element.
*   **Compromised Coffee Flavor:** Scale can impart a bitter, metallic taste to your coffee, masking the nuanced flavors you expect from your high-quality espresso.
*   **Clogged Components:** Over time, scale can clog the internal components of your machine, including the heating element, pump, and pipes. This can lead to reduced water flow, inconsistent brewing, and ultimately, complete machine failure.
*   **Increased Repair Costs:** Neglecting regular descaling can lead to costly repairs down the line. Preventing scale buildup is far more economical than dealing wiht the consequences of a neglected machine.

For businesses, the implications are even greater. Consistent coffee quality is paramount for customer satisfaction, and downtime due to scale buildup can negatively impact profitability. Regular professional descaling service is frequently enough essential for commercial Breville machines.

## Step-by-Step Breville Descaling Instructions: A Model-Specific Guide

The Breville descaling process varies slightly depending on your model. Always refer to your machine's user manual for specific instructions. However, here's a general guide:

**General Steps (applicable to most breville espresso machines):**

Remove the breville water filter as it will soak the descale solution if left in during the descaling process.4.  **Initiate the Descaling Cycle:** Turn on your Breville machine and enter the descaling mode. This usually involves pressing and holding specific buttons simultaneously (refer to your user manual for the correct sequence for your model; for example, tutorials are available online for the Barista Express).
5.  **Run the Descaling Cycle:** The machine will now run through a descaling cycle, which usually involves dispensing the descaling solution through the group head, steam wand, and hot water outlet. The Breville descaling cycle automated step will typically run for about 30 minutes.
6.  **Rinse Thoroughly:** After the descaling cycle is complete, empty and rinse the water tank thoroughly. Fill the tank with fresh water and run several rinse cycles to remove any remaining descaling solution. This is crucial to ensure no residue affects the taste of your coffee.
7. **Descale the steam and hot water components.** Manually turn the steam dial left towards the steam icon–wait about 13 seconds for the steam component to descale. this removes limescale build up from the steam wand.

*   **Breville Oracle Descaling:** The Oracle frequently enough has a more automated descaling process. Follow the on-screen prompts for guidance.
*   **Breville barista Pro Descaling:** Similar to the Barista Express, this model has a dedicated descaling program.
*   **Breville Bambino Descaling:** The Bambino is a more compact machine, but the descaling process is similar to other Breville models.
*   **Breville Infuser Descaling:** Follow the general descaling steps, consulting your user manual for the specific button sequence to initiate the descaling cycle.
*   **Breville dual Boiler Descaling:** This advanced machine may have a slightly different descaling process.Consult your user manual for detailed instructions. For example, ensure you appropriately manage the water levels in both boilers during the process.

**Troubleshooting:**

*   **Breville Descaling Light Stays On:** If the descaling light remains on after completing the descaling cycle, ensure you have thoroughly rinsed the machine and that the water tank is filled to the maximum level. If the problem persists, consult your user manual or contact breville customer support. Addressing the descale light on Breville is crucial to ensure the machine is operating correctly.
*   **Breville Descaling Error:** If you encounter a descaling error, refer to your user manual for troubleshooting steps. This could be due to low water levels, incorrect button sequence, or other issues. If you can't resolve the error, contacting Breville service center or a qualified repair technician is recommended.

Also- I started a 2nd pan in my tower sitting in the first one. I added shred, coffee grounds, and a few handfuls from the bottom pan. I put some dry worm food on top but I also took 2 old avocado- split them and just set them on top. I have a compulsion to check my worms bc I love them. I found a quick lift of one side of an avocado peel to see the crazy party that goes on under an avocado shell satisfies my need to see them and then I leave everything else alone. Just an fyi for the gals who like to say hi to the worms! Other than that I just lift everything off the white tray to save any stragglers that got through.

We have an interesting story: we met 3–4 years ago on a dating app, we got along good together. Have lot in common and same music taste. We created even a playlist together (this is important for later). She was one of the few people I‘ve met who showed real interest in the person I was, how i think and feel. At as it goes on, I thought at one point I was the only one putting in efforts to talk and I was young and naive, i had weird expectations of a relationship. I also came out of a fresh break up, so I wasnt emotionally available too. Even tho i like her alot I ended things by giving out random light reasons like we dont want the same thing sexually and we live too far away. She just agreed and i thought to myself „so she really wasn’t interested in me like Im in her“
On my 18th birthday (so 6–8 months with no contact) she reached out to me and wished me a happy bd. I was at this time in a toxic relationship and couldn’t reply to it fairly… and from that moment we keep on moving and lost contact.
But when life was bad or even big changes happen, i started listening to our playlist we started and that she added songs to it till 2022… from songs we enjoyed fading to heartbreaking songs. I started to wondering from time to time how she have been. Just wondering if she is doing fine.
But when I talk with one of my close friends about the topic regret at 3:00 the last month. I mention this story and we talk about her. Since then I couldn’t stop thinking about her. Admitting I kinda regret how i let things end like this and I start to realize after all this years that she may haven’t initiate conversation alot but she was deep down interested. With every song I listened I start to feel how she deeply she really felt… the songs just spoke for themselves.
I told myself I need to see her again. Only problem, I only had her spotify. No Social contact, No number , nothing. I came up one night created several accounts on spotify to follow her which build the sentence „please add me on instagram … hope you see this“ and luckily i got her snap in a block list and added her with an account on snap „look at your spotify followers“. Ik she would never add a randoms on snap that why.
On 25.3.25 she added me surprised back, and we started talking. It was… it felt just like back then. A little bit different since we changed also in the last few years. But the core felt the same for me. Shortly I ask if she is interested in grabbing a coffe and she agreed. She added a lil comment „after all this years“ even. Cause we agreed meeting up 3 years ago but cause of my immaturity we never did.
the date on 29.3 was just… I cant go on full details but we were walking around and just talked. And we had so much in comment even after all this years. From wanting a house with a nerdy chill room, same idea of marriage (she ask me about it), same values , similar believes and relationship to god. But even same music taste (95% spotify blend mix) , same interest in mangas and anime or just series in general. Same humor I would also say. The list could go on and it was just beyond what i ever could exspected. She holded my arm , we shared a bottle of water, she bullied me a lil too. We were in a cat coffee and like almost magic a cat jumped on our table and wanted to stay between us (we both like cats alot).The people around us were so jealous. I even let her drive my car (it was the first she drove a car in her life) and she was amazing at it ngl. Dont worry she only drive in a safe area , with enough space and no car or people around us. Just a lil adventure. We touched on some deep talks too but not as much since it was the first date.
it was 00:44 and she ask before she needed to go if I was okay with a kiss. I was shocked and needed to process it, cause it was just too much to handle and I told her that I want it too after an awkward moment to realize it. Unfortunately last second ,her friends arrive and she got shy too and we agreed to safe it for the next time.
She texted me after the date that she liked it alot and wanted to see me again. Beside some small things like wishing that i drive safe home and that i should text her when Im home.
without hesitation I agreed to a second date.
I notice she replied late and dry more over time but i thought its only because she got sick and needed rest. After a week of casually texting I receive a message out of nowhere from her. Telling me that after processing it , she dont want to keep getting to know me. And I asked why? And she only reply „its just a feeling and she couldn’t explain it either“.
Anyone can help me making sense of this?

But recently I’ve seen more skilled baristas deliberately pouring around the edge, apparently to rinse down grounds that might be stuck to the walls and ensure even extraction.

From what I can tell, it seems like this “filter flavor” concern might be more myth than fact, and that edge-pouring could actually help with consistency - as long as you’re not bypassing the coffee bed.

Curious what others do and why. ",1,1744386783.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

A barista and pour-over/filter/cafe service in general can be likened to being a battle-tested, military field surgeon who is trained to attend to and save multiple people at once in the greatest efficiency of time, with only the tools at hand, under any conditions, repeatably, day or night. 

A “home barista” making a single pour-over can be likened to a specialized hospital surgeon who is operating on a single patient for as much time as needed, with every single-use-case tool that they require carefully laid out in a tightly choreographed and controlled environment all designed to produce the best possible result for that specific person. 

My hot take: 

I don’t want someone who gets their kicks from perfecting butterfly stitches tasked with saving my life when I’m the fifth trauma case in line on a cot under a tent somewhere with minutes left to live. 

Conversely, a specialized surgeon will see my stitches after the field surgeon has saved my life and think to themselves, “I could’ve done better than that.”

What do we think about this — 

Should coffee shop filter coffee always be as good or superior to anything we can make at home? 

If we can make better coffee than our local coffee shop does that mean anything? 

Is it even fair to compare the two?",0,1744386754.0,pourover,6,0.5,False

1jwt29a,https://www.reddit.com/r/NaturesTemper/comments/1jwt29a/i_was_an_english_teacher_in_vietnam_i_will_never/,I Was an English Teacher in Vietnam... I Will Never Step Foot Inside a Jungle Again - Part 1 of 2,"My name is Sarah Branch. A few years ago, when I was 24 years old, I had left my home state of Utah and moved abroad to work as an English language teacher in Vietnam. Having just graduated BYU and earning my degree in teaching, I suddenly realized I needed so much more from my life. I always wanted to travel, embrace other cultures, and most of all, have memorable and life-changing experiences.  

Feeling trapped in my normal, everyday life outside of Salt Lake City, where winters are cold and summers always far away, I decided I was no longer going to live the life that others had chosen for me, and instead choose my own path in life – a life of fulfilment and little regrets. Already attaining my degree in teaching, I realized if I gained a further ESL Certification (teaching English as a second language), I could finally achieve my lifelong dream of travelling the world to far-away and exotic places – all the while working for a reasonable income. 

There were so many places I dreamed of going – maybe somewhere in South America or far east Asia. As long as the weather was warm and there were beautiful beaches for me to soak up the sun, I honestly did not mind. Scanning my finger over a map of the world, rotating from one hemisphere to the other, I eventually put my finger down on a narrow, little country called Vietnam. This was by no means a random choice. I had always wanted to travel to Vietnam because... I’m actually one-quarter Vietnamese. Not that you can tell or anything - my hair is brown and my skin is rather fair. But I figured, if I wanted to go where the sun was always shining, and there was an endless supply of tropical beaches, Vietnam would be the perfect destination! Furthermore, I’d finally get the chance to explore my heritage. 

Fortunately enough for me, it turned out Vietnam had a huge demand for English language teachers. They did prefer it if you were teaching in the country already - but after a few online interviews and some Visa complications later, I packed up my things in Utah and moved across the world to the Land of the Blue Dragon.  

I was relocated to a beautiful beach town in Central Vietnam, right along the coast of the South China Sea. English teachers don’t really get to choose where in the country they end up, but if I did have that option, I could not have picked a more perfect place... Because of the horrific turn this story will take, I can’t say where exactly it was in Central Vietnam I lived, or even the name of the beach town I resided in - just because I don’t want anyone to get the wrong idea. This part of Vietnam is a truly beautiful place and I don’t want to discourage anyone from going there. So, for the continuation of this story, I’m just going to refer to where I was as Central Vietnam – and as for the beach town where I made my living, I’m going to give it the pseudonym “Biển Hứa Hẹn” - which in Vietnamese, roughly, but rather fittingly translates to “Sea of Promise.”   

Biển Hứa Hẹn truly was the most perfect destination! It was a modest sized coastal town, nestled inside of a tropical bay, with the whitest sands and clearest blue waters you could possibly dream of. The town itself is also spectacular. Most of the houses and buildings are painted a vibrant sunny yellow, not only to look more inviting to tourists, but so to reflect the sun during the hottest months. For this reason, I originally wanted to give the town the nickname “Trấn Màu Vàng” (Yellow Town), but I quickly realized how insensitive that pseudonym would have been – so “Sea of Promise” it is!  

Alongside its bright, sunny buildings, Biển Hứa Hẹn has the most stunning oriental and French Colonial architecture – interspersed with many quality restaurants and coffee shops. The local cuisine is to die for! Not only is it healthy and delicious, but it's also surprisingly cheap – like we’re only talking 90 cents! You wouldn’t believe how many different flavours of Coffee Vietnam has. I mean, I went a whole 24 years without even trying coffee, and since I’ve been here, I must have tried around two-dozen flavours. Another whimsy little aspect of this town is the many multi-coloured, little plastic chairs that are dispersed everywhere. So whether it was dining on the local cuisine or trying my twenty-second flavour of coffee, I would always find one of these chairs – a different colour every time, sit down in the shade and just watch the world go by. 

I haven’t even mentioned how much I loved my teaching job. My classes were the most adorable 7 and 8 year-olds, and my colleagues were so nice and welcoming. They never called me by my first name. Instead my colleagues would always say “Chào em” or “Chào em gái”, which basically means “Hello little sister.”  

When I wasn’t teaching or grading papers, I spent most of my leisure time by the town’s beach - and being the boring, vanilla person I am, I didn’t really do much. Feeling the sun upon my skin while I observed the breath-taking scenery was more than enough – either that or I was curled up in a good book... I was never the only foreigner on this beach. Biển Hứa Hẹn is a popular tourist destination – mostly Western backpackers and surfers. So, if I wasn’t turning pink beneath the sun or memorizing every little detail of the bay’s geography, I would enviously spectate fellow travellers ride the waves. 

As much as I love Vietnam - as much as I love Biển Hứa Hẹn, what really spoils this place from being the perfect paradise is all the garbage pollution. I mean, it’s just everywhere. There is garbage in the town, on the beach and even in the ocean – and if it isn’t the garbage that spoils everything, it certainly is all the rats, cockroaches and other vermin brought with it. Biển Hứa Hẹn is such a unique place and it honestly makes me so mad that no one does anything about it... Nevertheless, I still love it here. It will always be a paradise to me – and if America was the Promised Land for Lehi and his descendants, then this was going to be my Promised Land.  

I had now been living in Biển Hứa Hẹn for 4 months, and although I had only 3 months left in my teaching contract, I still planned on staying in Vietnam - even if that meant leaving this region I’d fallen in love with and relocating to another part of the country. Since I was going to stay, I decided I really needed to learn Vietnamese – as you’d be surprised how few people there are in Vietnam who can speak any to no English. Although most English teachers in South-East Asia use their leisure time to travel, I rather boringly decided to spend most of my days at the same beach, sat amongst the sand while I studied and practised what would hopefully become my second language. 

On one of those days, I must have been completely occupied in my own world, because when I look up, I suddenly see someone standing over, talking down to me. I take off my headphones, and shading the sun from my eyes, I see a tall, late-twenty-something tourist - wearing only swim shorts and cradling a surfboard beneath his arm. Having come in from the surf, he thought I said something to him as he passed by, where I then told him I was speaking Vietnamese to myself, and didn’t realize anyone could hear me. We both had a good laugh about it and the guy introduces himself as Tyler. Like me, Tyler was American, and unsurprisingly, he was from California. He came to Vietnam for no other reason than to surf. Like I said, Tyler was this tall, very tanned guy – like he was the tannest guy I had ever seen. He had all these different tattoos he acquired from his travels, and long brown hair, which he regularly wore in a man-bun. When I first saw him standing there, I was taken back a little, because I almost mistook him as Jesus Christ – that's what he looked like. Tyler asks what I’m doing in Vietnam and later in the conversation, he invites me to have a drink with him and his surfer buddies at the beach town bar. I was a little hesitant to say yes, only because I don’t really drink alcohol, but Tyler seemed like a nice guy and so I agreed.  

Later that day, I meet Tyler at the bar and he introduces me to his three surfer friends. The first of Tyler’s friends was Chris, who he knew from back home. Chris was kinda loud and a little obnoxious, but I suppose he was also funny. The other two friends were Brodie and Hayley - a couple from New Zealand. Tyler and Chris met them while surfing in Australia – and ever since, the four of them have been travelling, or more accurately, surfing the world together. Over a few drinks, we all get to know each other a little better and I told them what it’s like to teach English in Vietnam. Curious as to how they’re able to travel so much, I ask them what they all do for a living. Tyler says they work as vloggers, bloggers and general content creators, all the while travelling to a different country every other month. You wouldn’t believe the number of places they’ve been to: Hawaii, Costa Rica, Sri Lanka, Bali – everywhere! They didn’t see the value of staying in just one place and working a menial job, when they could be living their best lives, all the while being their own bosses. It did make a lot of sense to me, and was not that unsimilar to my reasoning for being in Vietnam.  

The four of them were only going to be in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple more days, but when I told them I hadn’t yet explored the rest of the country, they insisted that I tag along with them. I did come to Vietnam to travel, not just stay in one place – the only problem was I didn’t have anyone to do it with... But I guess now I did. They even invited me to go surfing with them the next day. Having never surfed a day in my life, I very nearly declined the offer, but coming all this way from cold and boring Utah, I knew I had to embrace new and exciting opportunities whenever they arrived. 

By early next morning, and pushing through my first hangover, I had officially surfed my first ever wave. I was a little afraid I’d embarrass myself – especially in front of Tyler, but after a few trials and errors, I thankfully gained the hang of it. Even though I was a newbie at surfing, I could not have been that bad, because as soon as I surf my first successful wave, Chris would not stop calling me “Johnny Utah” - not that I knew what that meant. If I wasn’t embarrassing myself on a board, I definitely was in my ignorance of the guys’ casual movie quotes. For instance, whenever someone yelled out “Charlie Don’t Surf!” all I could think was, “Who the heck is Charlie?” 

By that afternoon, we were all back at the bar and I got to spend some girl time with Hayley. She was so kind to me and seemed to take a genuine interest in my life - or maybe she was just grateful not to be the only girl in the group anymore. She did tell me she thought Chris was extremely annoying, no matter where they were in the world - and even though Brodie was the quiet, sensible type for the most part, she hated how he acted when he was around the guys. Five beers later and Brodie was suddenly on his feet, doing some kind of native New Zealand war dance while Chris or Tyler vlogged. 

Although I was having such a wonderful time with the four of them, anticipating all the places in Vietnam Hayley said we were going, in the corner of my eye, I kept seeing the same strange man staring over at us. I thought maybe we were being too loud and he wanted to say something, but the man was instead looking at all of us with intrigue. Well, 10 minutes later, this very same man comes up to us with three strangers behind him. Very casually, he asks if we’re all having a good time. We kind of awkwardly oblige the man. A fellow traveller like us, who although was probably in his early thirties, looked more like a middle-aged dad on vacation - in an overly large Hawaiian shirt, as though to hide his stomach, and looking down at us through a pair of brainiac glasses. The strangers behind him were two other men and a young woman. One of the men was extremely hairy, with a beard almost as long as his own hair – while the other was very cleanly presented, short in height and holding a notepad. The young woman with them, who was not much older than myself, had a cool combination of dyed maroon hair and sleeve tattoos – although rather oddly, she was wearing way too much clothing for this climate. After some brief pleasantries, the man in the Hawaiian shirt then says, ‘I’m sorry to bother you folks, but I was wondering if we could ask you a few questions?’ 

Introducing himself as Aaron, the man tells us that he and his friends are documentary filmmakers, and were wanting to know what we knew of the local disappearances. Clueless as to what he was talking about, Aaron then sits down, without invitation at our rather small table, and starts explaining to us that for the past thirty years, tourists in the area have been mysteriously going missing without a trace. First time they were hearing of this, Tyler tells Aaron they have only been in Biển Hứa Hẹn for a couple of days. Since I was the one who lived and worked in the town, Hayley asks me if I knew anything of the missing tourists - and when she does, Aaron turns his full attention on me. Answering his many questions, I told Aaron I only heard in passing that tourists have allegedly gone missing, but wasn’t sure what to make of it. But while I’m telling him this, I notice the short guy behind him is writing everything I say down, word for word – before Aaron then asks me, with desperation in his voice, ‘Well, have you at least heard of the local legends?’  

Suddenly gaining an interest in what Aaron’s telling us, Tyler, Chris and Brodie drunkenly inquire, ‘Legends? What local legends?’ 

Taking another sip from his light beer, Aaron tells us that according to these legends, there are creatures lurking deep within the jungles and cave-systems of the region, and for centuries, local farmers or fishermen have only seen glimpses of them... Feeling as though we’re being told a scary bedtime story, Chris rather excitedly asks, ‘Well, what do these creatures look like?’ Aaron says the legends abbreviate and there are many claims to their appearance, but that they’re always described as being humanoid.   

Whatever these creatures were, paranormal communities and investigators have linked these legends to the disappearances of the tourists. All five of us realized just how silly this all sounded, which Brodie highlighted by saying, ‘You don’t actually believe that shite, do you?’ 

Without saying either yes or no, Aaron smirks at us, before revealing there are actually similar legends and sightings all around Central Vietnam – even by American soldiers as far back as the Vietnam War.  

‘You really don’t know about the cryptids of the Vietnam War?’ Aaron asks us, as though surprised we didn’t.  

Further educating us on this whole mystery, Aaron claims that during the war, several platoons and individual soldiers who were deployed in the jungles, came in contact with more than one type of creature.  

‘You never heard of the Rock Apes? The Devil Creatures of Quang Binh? The Big Yellows?’ 

If you were like us, and never heard of these creatures either, apparently what the American soldiers encountered in the jungles was a group of small Bigfoot-like creatures, that liked to throw rocks, and some sort of Lizard People, that glowed a luminous yellow and lived deep within the cave systems. 

Feeling somewhat ridiculous just listening to this, Tyler rather mockingly comments, ‘So, you’re saying you believe the reason for all the tourists going missing is because of Vietnamese Bigfoot and Lizard People?’ 

Aaron and his friends must have received this ridicule a lot, because rather than being insulted, they looked somewhat amused.  

‘Well, that’s why we’re here’ he says. ‘We’re paranormal investigators and filmmakers – and as far as we know, no one has tried to solve the mystery of the Vietnam Triangle. We’re in Biển Hứa Hẹn to interview locals on what they know of the disappearances, and we’ll follow any leads from there.’ 

Although I thought this all to be a little kooky, I tried to show a little respect and interest in what these guys did for a living – but not Tyler, Chris or Brodie. They were clearly trying to have fun at Aaron’s expense.  

‘So, what did the locals say? Is there a Vietnamese Loch Ness Monster we haven’t heard of?’  

Like I said, Aaron was well acquainted with this kind of ridicule, because rather spontaneously he replies, ‘Glad you asked!’ before gulping down the rest of his low-carb beer. ‘According to a group of fishermen we interviewed yesterday, there’s an unmapped trail that runs through the nearby jungles. Apparently, no one knows where this trail leads to - not even the locals do. And anyone who tries to find out for themselves... are never seen or heard from again.’ 

As amusing as we found these legends of ape-creatures and lizard-men, hearing there was a secret trail somewhere in the nearby jungles, where tourists are said to vanish - even if this was just a local legend... it was enough to unsettle all of us. Maybe there weren’t creatures abducting tourists in the jungles, but on an unmarked wilderness trail, anyone not familiar with the terrain could easily lose their way. Neither Tyler, Chris, Brodie or Hayley had a comment for this - after all, they were fellow travellers. As fun as their lifestyle was, they knew the dangers of venturing the more untamed corners of the world. The five of us just sat there, silently, not really knowing what to say, as Aaron very contentedly mused over us. 

‘We’re actually heading out tomorrow in search of the trail – we have directions and everything.’ Aaron then pauses on us... before he says, ‘If you guys don’t have any plans, why don’t you come along? After all, what’s the point of travelling if there ain’t a little danger involved?’  

Expecting someone in the group to tell him we already had plans, Tyler, Chris and Brodie share a look to one another - and to mine and Hayley’s surprise... they then agreed... Hayley obviously protested. She didn’t want to go gallivanting around the jungle where tourists supposedly vanished.  

‘Oh, come on Hayl’. It’ll be fun... Sarah? You’ll come, won’t you?’ 

‘Yeah. Johnny Utah wants to come, right?’  

Hayley stared at me, clearly desperate for me to take her side. I then glanced around the table to see so too was everyone else. Neither wanting to take sides or accept the invitation, all I could say was that I didn’t know what I wanted to do. 

Although Hayley and the guys were divided on whether or not to accompany Aaron’s expedition, it was ultimately left to a majority vote – and being too sheepish to protest, it now appeared our plans of travelling the country had changed to exploring the jungles of Central Vietnam... Even though I really didn’t want to go on this expedition – it could have been dangerous after all, I then reminded myself why I came to Vietnam in the first place... To have memorable and life changing experiences – and I wasn’t going to have any of that if I just said no when the opportunity arrived. Besides, tourists may well have gone missing in the region, but the supposed legends of jungle-dwelling creatures were probably nothing more than just stories. I spent my whole life believing in stories that turned out not to be true and I wasn’t going to let that continue now. 

Later that night, while Brodie and Hayley spent some alone time, and Chris was with Aaron’s friends (smoking you know what), Tyler invited me for a walk on the beach under the moonlight. Strolling barefoot along the beach, trying not to step on any garbage, Tyler asks me if I’m really ok with tomorrow’s plans – and that I shouldn’t feel peer-pressured into doing anything I didn’t really wanna do. I told him I was ok with it and that it should be fun.  

‘Don’t worry’ he said, ‘I’ll keep an eye on you.’ 

I’m a little embarrassed to admit this... but I kinda had a crush on Tyler. He was tall, handsome and adventurous. If anything, he was the sort of person I wanted to be: travelling the world and meeting all kinds of people from all kinds of places. I was a little worried he’d find me boring - a small city girl whose only other travel story was a premature mission to Florida. Well soon enough, I was going to have a whole new travel story... This travel story. 

We get up early the next morning, and meeting Aaron with his documentary crew, we each take separate taxis out of Biển Hứa Hẹn. Following the cab in front of us, we weren’t even sure where we were going exactly. Curving along a highway which cuts through a dense valley, Aaron’s taxi suddenly pulls up on the curve, where he and his team jump out to the beeping of angry motorcycle drivers. Flagging our taxi down, Aaron tells us that according to his directions, we have to cut through the valley here and head into the jungle. 

Although we didn’t really know what was going to happen on this trip – we were just along for the ride after all, Aaron’s plan was to hike through the jungle to find the mysterious trail, document whatever they could, and then move onto a group of cave-systems where these “creatures” were supposed to lurk. Reaching our way down the slope of the valley, we follow along a narrow stream which acted as our temporary trail. Although this was Aaron’s expedition, as soon as we start our hike through the jungle, Chris rather mockingly calls out, ‘Alright everyone. Keep a lookout for Lizard People, Bigfoot and Charlie’ where again, I thought to myself, “Who the heck is Charlie?”

I'm (22F) living in a small two bedroom apartment with a roommate also (22F)  I've known since college. We get along fine, have pretty different schedules, and generally just do our own thing, I'm super comfortable at home, I'll wear shorts, crop tops tank tops sometimes even just a big T-shirt and underwear when I'm in my room or going to the kitchen real quick.

Recently, my roommate's Girlfriend (23F) has been spending a lot more time over. Like she's here basically every day, and sometimes even when my roommate not. I don't mind, but I'm starting to feel like I have tiptoe around my own place.

The other day I walked into the kitchen in a big sleep shirt and no bra (nothing showing  just comfy), and she was there making herself coffee. Later that night, my roommate confronted me and said I need to start being more mindful of what I wear when she's around. She said I was making her uncomfortable and it's ""not appropriate"" to walk around like that when we have guests.

I told her I wasn't doing anything weird I was just existing in my home. And if she's uncomfortable, maybe she shouldn't be over so much? She said I was being defensive and acting like I want her attention, which honestly pissed me off. (And I'm okay with gay people but I'm not soo...)

It's my apartment too. I pay rent just like she does. Do I really need to change how I dress in my own space because her girlfriend has eyes?

So... AITA?",20,1744386245.0,AITAH,36,0.76,False

He hosted a party at some point and the main character went with the main girl, they end up hitting it off and since the main guy was best friends with the host he new the code to the hot tub room so main guy and main girl go in there and start making out, until the host's dad catches them. He has a little talk with the main guy. At one point the ex-bsf of the main guy and him have a PHYSICAL fight in main guy's room over idk what. Oh and I think at the end the main guy tries to take a piece of jewelry from the ex-bsf's mom (i forgot why) and he thinks he got away with it but when he tries to escape and enter the code to get out it's wrong so the house intruder alarm goes off, he gets caught and arrested for like idk maybe a day?

1jwsuux,https://www.reddit.com/r/JewishDating/comments/1jwsuux/looking_for_my_jewish_husband/,looking for my jewish husband!!,"I'm a 24F from South Florida who feels lost looking for my soulmate. I'd like to consider myself wife-like. I'm fairly religious. I have a casual Shabbat dinner with my family every Friday and go to temple about 1-2 times a month. I celebrate all the holidays and went to religious school for 9 years. I'm hoping to find a man who enjoys carrying on the traditions and memories from camp and hebrew school, while remaining relaxed and eating bacon cheese burgers. 

My career takes up a good amount of my time and then I spend my free time between friends, gym, and social groups for young Jews and Israeli activism. I would like to find a gentleman that would be interested in doing these things with me. 

I feel out of luck to find single Jewish men that will pursue me. I'm on hinge and while it's flooded with potential men, they don't really maintain the casualty of meeting up for a coffee. It's either tears of insecurity, can't engage in a conversation that isn't regarding themselves, or immediately asking to go on a date (which tells me i'm not special). 

Do other Jewish women/men feel the same about the dating pool?

1jwstg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1jwstg3/entitled_start_up/,Entitled Start Up,"I was recently reached out to by one of my recruiters for this analytics role at this finance start up in my industry. I’m hesitant because I can’t tell what their firm is trying to do in a crowded space but I like the recruiter and so I take the call with the CTO. 

The CTO wants me then to take an hour and a half train ride to meet in person for a first round interview. I tell him no but we can do zoom (I recently had another role where they wanted a first round interview in person and said yes and walked in and they immediately were like oh we misread the resume we don’t need to do this interview but that’s another story). So I get him to agree to do Zoom. 

The entire time he is clearly not listening and he keeps asking the same questions because he’s forgetting what he asked. He waves somebody in his office has a 5 minute chat while I’m sat there on zoom then he leaves for 10 minutes and he comes back and is like well let’s have coffee by you for round two - I still haven’t gotten to ask any question and don’t know what their firm does. I tell him sure get off the call, call the recruiter and tell him I’m not moving forward with the process. 

Two weeks later the recruiter calls me on vacation telling me the CTO has been hounding him to get me back in the room and that he knows he was unprofessional. I agree then to meet with the right hand man tomorrow to restart the process - mainly because I’m still curious in what they’re trying to build. 

Next day I lay in the sun I’m relaxing on vacation comes to 8 pm I join the call - immediately he asks for me to open Python to do a surprise technical. I’ve never been so off put by a company and immediately called my recruiter to tell him to tell them they can go to hell.

And I still don’t know what the hell they do there.",2,1744385794.0,recruitinghell,1,1.0,False

The title is a little harsh but bear with me
I have been plus sized my whole life and have been bullied for it so it has always been a sore subject for me

I have slowly gotten comfortable at the gym and fixed my relationship with food in general 

With that explained i want to get into the real story; this happened a couple days ago at my place of work, i work at a coffee shop attached to a bookstore so all kinds of people come in and out.

I had just clocked in and this group of 5 kids walk up to the register to order, one kid (14? 15?) looked at me and said “ look its gorlock!!” Now i know who is referring to and I do a fake little annoyed laugh. I thought that would have been the end of it.

I then walk to help another customer and i walk from behind the counter and the kid looks at me “ daaaamn” i will not lie and say i kept a stone face and didnt respond i did, i responded back “ big talk for someone who looks like steve from Minecraft “ his friend tease him about it and i go back to working, he then whistles at me like a dog to get my attention.

I tell my manager in the cafe area so he is now aware, the kids finally walk off and i am shaking upset…

But that was just act one in this story

i have to go out back to take out our trash, it was a busy Saturday so i dont think anything of it

The way the trash cans are set up there is a small back ally area where the dumpsters are and there is a big grassy fence that separates the dumpster are and the road

My manager and i hear “ HEY GORLOCK!!!”
The kid was on the other side of the fence yelling this phrase at me over and over again.

We were both kinda shocked at first but my manager says “ get a life dude” and once again, from my pain i yell “ hows your parents divorce going? Oh? It hasnt happened yet, wait” which i know i should not have given him a reaction but i was hurt and i was desperately trying to defend myself and scare the kid away

The kid them proceeded to oink at me, over and over again, i was immediately thrown back to my mind in highschool and i started to cry, my manager sees and takes me inside to calm me down 

“ YEAH PIGGY GO BACK INSIDE”

That was the last thing i heard him say before my manager shut the door

I know i am in the wrong for arguing back with a child but yeah, i felt like typing it out would help

I can and will update if need be

Love yall, please be kind to eachother

""The Duchess of Sussex is trying to prove she's still got it. But did she ever have it to begin with?""

Whatever successes Narkle had / has is not the result of _her_ hard work, but the result of swinging a leg over a man.

Some snippets:

> But as is Meghan’s customary behavior, alongside her previous podcast, her philanthropic endeavors, her lifestyle brand and her Netflix series, she’s determined to do it whether she’s talented at it or not.

🤣 I'm sure many people have tried to tell Narkle that she's terrible at pretty much everything she's ever attempted and to take a f*cking seat, but it seems the gal suffers from a chronic condition of selective hearing. 

> Meghan’s fortunate enough to have the heavy hitters in her corner—the CEOs, the journalists, the actors, the tech entrepreneurs. But instead of serving her audience something meaningful and original, she’s serving herself. 

How embarrassing for Narkle, to have access to the best people and resources, and yet her yawn-fest still sucks. 

> But that’s also because there’s no substance. Where there should be depth and honesty, there’s insincerity and a heavily contrived appearance. Where there should be practical guidance about success, how to organize your days as a working mom, how to manage a start-up or even bring one to life, how to find investors, there’s excessive praise and a fawning conversation that could’ve happened in line at a coffee shop as opposed to a podcast platform.

Depth and honesty. Well, there's Narkle's problem right there. How could the vacuous narcissist, with her tenuous relationship with reality and _many_ varying recollections, deliver anything but drivel?

> We’re not given directions on how to prioritize family in a fast-paced lifestyle, or how to approach discussing your professional goals with your spouse. Instead, there’s a conversation about which packing material Meghan should use for the artisanal jam her lifestyle brand supplies. It’s this kind of absurdity that taints the conversation with an air of contrived superiority, and not the honesty that women who seek success need to hear.

Aww, give the talentless grifter a break. People talk about what they know. Narkle knows packing materials. How to build and run a successful business? Not so much. 

> In Meghan Markle’s case, instead of breaking down the barrier on what it really means to work and to create while building a family, she’s turning around and selling a beige brand of hustle culture to her audience, with her own trademarked logo stamped on it.

Is Whatever trademarked? Whatevs, the logo is boring and cheap, just like it's founder.

> Confessions of a Female Founder isn’t a character study of success and ambition, but one of mediocrity and even narcissism. What’s worse is that there are genuinely women out there looking for role models, for guidance, for girl-to-girl advice on how to make it and become a founder themselves. But if the first episode is anything to go by, you won’t find that with the Duchess of Sussex.

But good news for all you women out there who want guidance on how to be a mediocre, flopping narcissist -- Narkle is your sherpa!",62,1744385578.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,5,1.0,False

1jwskac,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1jwskac/5_night_stay_at_finest_playa_mujeres/,5 Night Stay at Finest Playa Mujeres,"We did a last-minute booking and stayed 5 nights in a Junior Suite with our 9-year-old son. We've previously stayed at Paradisus, Hard Rock, Fairmont, Excellence, Palladium, Playacar resorts - Ask me anything.   
  
Couple tips and comments.   
\- When we arrived we asked if there were any rooms to upgrade to. They said only junior suites left but can upgrade to club experience for a room with a better view. They also said they were 80% full.   
\- Booking directly through the resort included free private transportation in a black SUV, which was a really nice perk to start the trip off stress-free.   
\- It took us 70 minutes from parking at the gate to arriving at the resort - we arrived at 1:20pm and had carry-on luggage only. Quickly and seamlessly found our transportation and were on our way.   
\- Tourist Tax - wasn't aware and had no issue arriving or departing. 

**Cleanliness: 5/5** The entire resort was spotless. Rooms, beach, common areas—everything was always clean, with staff working constantly to maintain it.

**Pool & Beach: 4/5**  
There were multiple pools and lots of loungers available. Only the pool bar area was tricky to grab a seat at, and even then, servers were everywhere, so not sitting right at the bar didn’t matter much. We didn’t upgrade to the Excellence or Finest Club and didn’t feel like we missed out. Those clubs get access to a private lounge, a specific beach area, and an adults-only restaurant, but we were perfectly happy without the upgrade.

**Kids Club: 4/5**  
This was a highlight! There were multiple sections based on age, two small water parks, and a big bouncy ball pool that kids loved. Perfect setup for families.

**Food: 4/5**  
It's an all-inclusive resort, so we came in with reasonable expectations—but honestly, this was the best food we've had at an AI resort. The shrimp dishes at Duke’s were a standout, and service was consistently great. The buffet had fresh, tasty options for breakfast and lunch. Dinner at Brass was enjoyable, though our steaks were undercooked twice, but the staff handled it quickly and professionally.

There are so many restaurants on the property that it’s honestly hard to get to them all in just five nights. Highly recommend booking the **teppanyaki dinner**—it was a fun experience and the food was great, but you do need a reservation for it, so plan ahead!

They also had some awesome extras:

* A food truck open from noon to midnight serving tacos, burgers, and nachos
* A bakery and coffee shop open all day
* A juice bar with fresh coconuts from 12–2pm
* Two self-serve soft serve ice cream machines (huge hit for the kids—and us!)

**Service: 5/5**  
Everyone was kind, attentive, and welcoming. We never felt like we were a bother when asking questions or ordering drinks.

**Spa:**  
We didn’t get a massage, but we were hoping to use the sauna or steam room. Those were $30 without a treatment, which felt a little overpriced.

**Entertainment & Extras: 4/5**  
The nightly entertainment was fantastic. Each evening had a different show—from live music and an acrobat performance to a pirate-themed show and a fun Michael Jackson tribute. There was even a **kids-only magic show**, which was a big hit with our son. We also spent some relaxing time at Legends Bar, which was a great place to watch sports or play games.",5,1744385134.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

1jwsj33,https://www.reddit.com/r/manifestingSP/comments/1jwsj33/manifest_ex_back_two_success_story/,Manifest EX Back Two Success Story,"Here, I have two success stories, each person did it in different ways. It’s interesting to note, however, that although each person here manifested using different techniques, in both cases they ultimately ‘felt’ the same way.

**Em’s Ex Back Story in a Nutshell**  
Em is a friend of mine. We hadn’t seen each other for some time when we met up by accident a couple of years ago. She had split from her partner and was not in the best place, although she was in a state of natural acceptance. He was living with someone else at this point. Now, rightly or wrongly, I told her what I was doing these days…. specific person manifestation is all well and good, but when you are speaking to someone who is moving through the break-up process and who you know will get there at some point, is it wise to give them this information? Want Real Manifestaion Practices then [ManifestationRealRule](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestaionREALRule/)

First of all, I thought NO. I should not have told her it was indeed possible to manifest him back into her life. Why? Because it set her back a good few months. The healing process stalled and she became obsessed with the whole idea of it. She became a manic manifestor! She forgot that the healing process is vital in order to move on or to have the relationship back.

I’m going to cut a very long story short, as I have told this story on numerous occasions (if you want to see the full story you can do so by becoming a member here).

**Stop Manifesting Your Ex Back EM!**  
After a few months of nothing, Em decided enough was enough. I told her to stop! Cease and desist and start living her life once more. I told her to set a firm intention to be with him again. She isn’t really a resentful person and she was easily able to forgive, as she could see that she was partly to blame. With no contrary feelings, a short while later she bumped into him, literally   
Bear in mind she hadn’t seen him for many months. They chatted, they grabbed a coffee and chatted some more. His relationship was over. It had ended pretty much at the point that Em had stopped manifesting him.

They had been in a new relationship for over a year. A few weeks ago they split up again. This time, however, Em ended it. It was all very amicable and they remain friends, but she feels she has changed and he has not. That’s not to say he isn’t more considerate and actually a very decent BF, but she wants different things now. She puts this down to an interest in reality creation and more of a focus on what she actually wants in life.

So manifesting your person does not mean it’s a permanent arrangement. It doesn’t have to be your last chance at love. They might well be the one, but they might not. Try not to look at the manifestation of them as the be-all and end-all. See it as an opportunity to give it a go.

**My Thoughts on Em’s Specific Person Manifestation**  
As soon as Em decided enough was enough and really felt it, she opened up the reality she wanted to experience. Her obsessive manifesting was holding her back. It was holding her in the same 3D. She was having the experience she was feeling and she was feeling stuck.  
She still wanted him, but she instinctively knew that this was not the way. When you’ve been at something for a long time with no results, it’s time to try something new — and ‘doing nothing’ is often the new you need.  
She let it go. Not the idea of being with him, but the notion that she could force it. You cannot force manifestation. It’s not a try-hard process. It’s a *trust in something you don’t understand* process. That can be your own subconscious mind, your higher self, God, the Universe…. for me it’s the subconscious. It’s simple, it works for me. It’s there for me any time I need it and it will do as I ask.

**Claire’s Specific Person Success Story**  
Claire had become attached to a guy she works with. They had become great friends and the more they spent time together, the more she fell for him. He was in a relationship, however. Personally, I am not a coach that teaches people to scrub out the third party, get rid of them in some way. Why don’t I like that particular model of manifestation? It’s negative, it’s giving attention to what we don’t like, it’s messing with the middle. Reality will sort this one way or another with no need for intervention from us.

Claire and Guy (not his actual name) spent a night together. They were on a course at work and staying away. They were drunk, her more so than him, and it just happened. Her words, not mine. Nothing *just* happens. It happened because she was manifesting him.

**Claire’s Manifesting Technique**  
Affirmations, persistent and consistent.  
‘Guy is in love with me’  
‘Guy wants me’  
‘Guy can’t stop thinking about me’  
– hmmmm. What’s the problem with these affirmations? You might ask. Do you see how they relate to his feelings and nothing else? So what if he is crazy about her, if he can’t stop thinking about her? He was those things, but he decided not to take things any further after that night. He had indeed fallen for her, but apart from those feelings, he felt freaked out. She sensed it and she went full on — both in action and internally. The more she pushed for something from him, the more he pulled away, until they were reduced to polite conversation at work and nothing outside of work. He avoided her at all costs.

She came to me with exhaustion. She was worn out, frustrated, angry — both at herself and him. She was confused too.  
‘I thought this was how conscious manifestation worked,’ she said.  
‘No, it isn’t. This is how conscious manifestation backfires!’

**Why Hadn’t Her SP-Based Affirmations Worked?**  
They had. Guy did feel those things. But in the end, he pulled away and avoided her. He felt he had made a huge mistake and he told her it wouldn’t work between them.  
Affirmations are merely a placebo when it comes to manifesting. Everything is. A far better affirmation would be this:  
‘I am able to create relationships easily and with whoever I want’ or  
‘I can be happy no matter who is in my life’ or  
‘Relationships with people I am attracted to come easy to me’  
– The list is endless. If you put the focus of your affirmations on that specific person, you will inevitably run into resistance at some point. You will feel disappointment when you don’t hear the exact words you have been affirming for, and this little disappointment will lead to more of the same. That vibration is contagious. It grows and grows over a very short time until reality is nothing like you’ve been affirming.

**What Did I Advise Claire to Do Next**  
I know Claire is a doer. She likes to take action in all areas of her life, so me telling her to set a clear intention and be done with it would not have worked for her. It would have caused her more resistance. It’s important that we work with what we know about ourselves.

I told Claire to ditch the idea of being with him right now. To indeed set a clear and concise intention, and to hold the idea of that in her heart. Then I told her to say ‘whatever’ each and every time she started to feel anxious about it not happening or about making a fool of herself. I told her to be polite when she saw him at work but not to make idle chit-chat as she had been attempting to do. I also told her to stop posting on her Instagram account as she had gone into overdrive in the hope that he would suddenly realise what he was missing. That almost never happens. When we post for attention, all we do is show them that we are available, we are desperate for them to reach out, and we are clearly trying to get their attention. You get attention on social media by NOT posting, not showing what you are doing at all times. You create an air of mystery by keeping quiet.

**Social Media and Your Specific Person**  
I stopped posting anything on social media a couple of years ago and I can’t even bring myself to post a birthday pic now! Remember, it’s not real. It’s a snapshot into someone's life in that moment but it doesn’t mean anything. There are guys (and women) that have numerous affairs and post loved-up pics with their partners all the time like they have the perfect relationship. She knows about most of them and he continues to behave in the same manner. Nothing perfect about that relationship, but it looks like a fairytale. If you see shots of them looking super-happy, dismiss it as of no consequence. In fact, better not to look at all. If you know that seeing something you don’t like will send you into a spiral, avoid at all costs. What we can’t see can’t hurt us.

**Claire’s New Affirmations**  
‘I get what I want without trying’  
‘I can let that shit go’  
‘I choose to let reality move for me and bring me a great relationship’

When you can say with conviction ‘Them or someone better’ you are starting to detach.

Fast forward four months. Yes, four months! That’s not so long really. Claire got a text:  
‘Hey, how’s things?’  
‘Great,’ she replied. She did tell me that she was desperate to say more but as I had told her repeatedly, less IS more.  
‘Fancy catching up sometime? It’s been ages.’  
‘Can do’ – She remembered me telling her about that phrase and me. Whenever anyone uses it when I ask them to do something, I immediately feel like they aren’t that bothered. It’s because my brother uses it a lot and I know when he doesn’t really want to do something so I have transferred it to others! I should know better. Anyway, Claire remembered it in the moment and smiled to herself as she used it!  
‘Do you want to?’ Came his response.  
‘Sure’

So, to cut another really long story short, they met for lunch. He told her his relationship was going nowhere, that lately he kept thinking of her, that she was the most interesting person he’d ever met, that she was gorgeous…. he went on.

**What did Claire do next?**  
She stayed strong even though she wanted to drag him to the bathroom and rip his clothes off.  
‘That’s really nice. I like you a lot too but I can’t see you while you’re in a relationship.’  
‘Okay, I understand. Can we still meet up like this though?’  
‘I don’t think that will be good for me.’  
‘Oh, right. No, I suppose not. Sorry. I don’t know what to do. We’ve been together for ten years now.’  
‘If you find yourself single, drop me a line.’

This was the end of the conversation. I have to say that Claire was devastated. She cried and told me that nothing had worked out how she wanted it to. She was missing what HAD happened. She had gone from completely dismissed by him to being chased. After a couple of days with nothing from her, she emailed me.  
You are right! I was so stuck on the specifics that I lost sight of the positives. Actually, before he texted me I wasn’t all that bothered. I had started to go ages without even thinking about him. Why am I so bothered? He sort of suggested an affair didn’t he? I don’t want that and what does that say about him? No, it’s all or nothing and that’s that. I’m going to Ibiza next week so he can do one!!

Claire went to Ibiza. She had a fling with a guy from the States, she had a great time with her mates and said she barely thought of Guy at all. When she got home, she realised he had followed her stories (I have no idea how you do that or what that even means). He posted something about relationships ending and she assumed he was referring to her. No, he was referring to his ten-year relationship.

Phew, I said these were going to be shortened versions didn’t I!? Well, six weeks in and he’s cooked her dinner twice, they went to watch Indiana Jones, she’s moved offices (which she says is for the best), he texts her every few days, mostly memes and other pointless things (in my opinion) but hey, he’s a man. They don’t do communication like we do. Best to accept that and stop making a big deal of the weekly text count. Claire says she likes him a lot, she fancies him a lot, but she is no longer obsessed. She has the odd worry that he will go back to his ex but as I told her, ‘Enjoy it for what it is right now. Don’t worry about what might happen or what it could be.’ – She’ll be fine whatever happens.

**How did Claire do it?**  
She stopped caring so much. She started to live her life in the knowledge that it was possible to be with him but it wasn’t everything to her anymore. She started to see her own worth again and she stopped berating herself for how she had behaved. Let’s face it, most of us have chased after a person at some point in our lives. Yes, you feel like an idiot when it goes south but I guarantee you that it will bother you more than it bothers the other person. Whilst you’ll concern yourself about it, they’ll have moved past it and probably never think about it again.

So you see, in both cases, detachment to a point had come into it. Each put themselves above the other person finally and took hyper-focus away from the situation. They were no longer observing the 3D and considering it to be sub-standard. They let it be and found a way to dilute those feelings of attachment.

She had split from her partner and was not in the best place, although she was in a state of natural acceptance. He was living with someone else at this point. Now, rightly or wrongly, I told her what I was doing these days…. specific person manifestation is all well and good, but when you are speaking to someone who is moving through the break-up process and who you know will get there at some point, is it wise to give them this information? Want Real Manifestaion Practices then [ManifestationRealRule](https://www.reddit.com/r/ManifestaionREALRule/)

First of all, I thought NO. I should not have told her it was indeed possible to manifest him back into her life. Why? Because it set her back a good few months. The healing process stalled and she became obsessed with the whole idea of it. She became a manic manifestor! She forgot that the healing process is vital in order to move on or to have the relationship back.

I’m going to cut a very long story short, as I have told this story on numerous occasions (if you want to see the full story you can do so by becoming a member here).

**Stop Manifesting Your Ex Back EM!**  
After a few months of nothing, Em decided enough was enough. I told her to stop! Cease and desist and start living her life once more. I told her to set a firm intention to be with him again. She isn’t really a resentful person and she was easily able to forgive, as she could see that she was partly to blame. With no contrary feelings, a short while later she bumped into him, literally 🙂  
Bear in mind she hadn’t seen him for many months. They chatted, they grabbed a coffee and chatted some more. His relationship was over. It had ended pretty much at the point that Em had stopped manifesting him.

They had been in a new relationship for over a year. A few weeks ago they split up again. This time, however, Em ended it. It was all very amicable and they remain friends, but she feels she has changed and he has not. That’s not to say he isn’t more considerate and actually a very decent BF, but she wants different things now. She puts this down to an interest in reality creation and more of a focus on what she actually wants in life.

So manifesting your person does not mean it’s a permanent arrangement. It doesn’t have to be your last chance at love. They might well be the one, but they might not. Try not to look at the manifestation of them as the be-all and end-all. See it as an opportunity to give it a go.

**My Thoughts on Em’s Specific Person Manifestation**  
As soon as Em decided enough was enough and really felt it, she opened up the reality she wanted to experience. Her obsessive manifesting was holding her back. It was holding her in the same 3D. She was having the experience she was feeling and she was feeling stuck.  
She still wanted him, but she instinctively knew that this was not the way. When you’ve been at something for a long time with no results, it’s time to try something new — and ‘doing nothing’ is often the new you need.  
She let it go. Not the idea of being with him, but the notion that she could force it. You cannot force manifestation. It’s not a try-hard process. It’s a *trust in something you don’t understand* process. That can be your own subconscious mind, your higher self, God, the Universe…. for me it’s the subconscious. It’s simple, it works for me. It’s there for me any time I need it and it will do as I ask.

**Claire’s Specific Person Success Story**  
Claire had become attached to a guy she works with. They had become great friends and the more they spent time together, the more she fell for him. He was in a relationship, however. Personally, I am not a coach that teaches people to scrub out the third party, get rid of them in some way. Why don’t I like that particular model of manifestation? It’s negative, it’s giving attention to what we don’t like, it’s messing with the middle. Reality will sort this one way or another with no need for intervention from us.

Claire and Guy (not his actual name) spent a night together. They were on a course at work and staying away. They were drunk, her more so than him, and it just happened. Her words, not mine. Nothing *just* happens. It happened because she was manifesting him.

**Claire’s Manifesting Technique**  
Affirmations, persistent and consistent.  
‘Guy is in love with me’  
‘Guy wants me’  
‘Guy can’t stop thinking about me’  
– hmmmm. What’s the problem with these affirmations? You might ask. Do you see how they relate to his feelings and nothing else? So what if he is crazy about her, if he can’t stop thinking about her? He was those things, but he decided not to take things any further after that night. He had indeed fallen for her, but apart from those feelings, he felt freaked out. She sensed it and she went full on — both in action and internally. The more she pushed for something from him, the more he pulled away, until they were reduced to polite conversation at work and nothing outside of work. He avoided her at all costs.

She came to me with exhaustion. She was worn out, frustrated, angry — both at herself and him. She was confused too.  
‘I thought this was how conscious manifestation worked,’ she said.  
‘No, it isn’t. This is how conscious manifestation backfires!’

**Why Hadn’t Her SP-Based Affirmations Worked?**  
They had. Guy did feel those things. But in the end, he pulled away and avoided her. He felt he had made a huge mistake and he told her it wouldn’t work between them.  
Affirmations are merely a placebo when it comes to manifesting. Everything is. A far better affirmation would be this:  
‘I am able to create relationships easily and with whoever I want’ or  
‘I can be happy no matter who is in my life’ or  
‘Relationships with people I am attracted to come easy to me’  
– The list is endless. If you put the focus of your affirmations on that specific person, you will inevitably run into resistance at some point. You will feel disappointment when you don’t hear the exact words you have been affirming for, and this little disappointment will lead to more of the same. That vibration is contagious. It grows and grows over a very short time until reality is nothing like you’ve been affirming.

**What Did I Advise Claire to Do Next**  
I know Claire is a doer. She likes to take action in all areas of her life, so me telling her to set a clear intention and be done with it would not have worked for her. It would have caused her more resistance. It’s important that we work with what we know about ourselves.

I told Claire to ditch the idea of being with him right now. To indeed set a clear and concise intention, and to hold the idea of that in her heart. Then I told her to say ‘whatever’ each and every time she started to feel anxious about it not happening or about making a fool of herself. I told her to be polite when she saw him at work but not to make idle chit-chat as she had been attempting to do. I also told her to stop posting on her Instagram account as she had gone into overdrive in the hope that he would suddenly realise what he was missing. That almost never happens. When we post for attention, all we do is show them that we are available, we are desperate for them to reach out, and we are clearly trying to get their attention. You get attention on social media by NOT posting, not showing what you are doing at all times. You create an air of mystery by keeping quiet.

**Social Media and Your Specific Person**  
I stopped posting anything on social media a couple of years ago and I can’t even bring myself to post a birthday pic now! Remember, it’s not real. It’s a snapshot into someone's life in that moment but it doesn’t mean anything. There are guys (and women) that have numerous affairs and post loved-up pics with their partners all the time like they have the perfect relationship. She knows about most of them and he continues to behave in the same manner. Nothing perfect about that relationship, but it looks like a fairytale. If you see shots of them looking super-happy, dismiss it as of no consequence. In fact, better not to look at all. If you know that seeing something you don’t like will send you into a spiral, avoid at all costs. What we can’t see can’t hurt us.

**Claire’s New Affirmations**  
‘I get what I want without trying’  
‘I can let that shit go’  
‘I choose to let reality move for me and bring me a great relationship’

When you can say with conviction ‘Them or someone better’ you are starting to detach.

Fast forward four months. Yes, four months! That’s not so long really. Claire got a text:  
‘Hey, how’s things?’  
‘Great,’ she replied. She did tell me that she was desperate to say more but as I had told her repeatedly, less IS more.  
‘Fancy catching up sometime? It’s been ages.’  
‘Can do’ – She remembered me telling her about that phrase and me. Whenever anyone uses it when I ask them to do something, I immediately feel like they aren’t that bothered. It’s because my brother uses it a lot and I know when he doesn’t really want to do something so I have transferred it to others! I should know better. Anyway, Claire remembered it in the moment and smiled to herself as she used it!  
‘Do you want to?’ Came his response.  
‘Sure’

So, to cut another really long story short, they met for lunch. He told her his relationship was going nowhere, that lately he kept thinking of her, that she was the most interesting person he’d ever met, that she was gorgeous…. he went on.

**What did Claire do next?**  
She stayed strong even though she wanted to drag him to the bathroom and rip his clothes off.  
‘That’s really nice. I like you a lot too but I can’t see you while you’re in a relationship.’  
‘Okay, I understand. Can we still meet up like this though?’  
‘I don’t think that will be good for me.’  
‘Oh, right. No, I suppose not. Sorry. I don’t know what to do. We’ve been together for ten years now.’  
‘If you find yourself single, drop me a line.’

This was the end of the conversation. I have to say that Claire was devastated. She cried and told me that nothing had worked out how she wanted it to. She was missing what HAD happened. She had gone from completely dismissed by him to being chased. After a couple of days with nothing from her, she emailed me.  
You are right! I was so stuck on the specifics that I lost sight of the positives. Actually, before he texted me I wasn’t all that bothered. I had started to go ages without even thinking about him. Why am I so bothered? He sort of suggested an affair didn’t he? I don’t want that and what does that say about him? No, it’s all or nothing and that’s that. I’m going to Ibiza next week so he can do one!!

Claire went to Ibiza. She had a fling with a guy from the States, she had a great time with her mates and said she barely thought of Guy at all. When she got home, she realised he had followed her stories (I have no idea how you do that or what that even means). He posted something about relationships ending and she assumed he was referring to her. No, he was referring to his ten-year relationship.

Phew, I said these were going to be shortened versions didn’t I!? Well, six weeks in and he’s cooked her dinner twice, they went to watch Indiana Jones, she’s moved offices (which she says is for the best), he texts her every few days, mostly memes and other pointless things (in my opinion) but hey, he’s a man. They don’t do communication like we do. Best to accept that and stop making a big deal of the weekly text count. Claire says she likes him a lot, she fancies him a lot, but she is no longer obsessed. She has the odd worry that he will go back to his ex but as I told her, ‘Enjoy it for what it is right now. Don’t worry about what might happen or what it could be.’ – She’ll be fine whatever happens.

**How did Claire do it?**  
She stopped caring so much. She started to live her life in the knowledge that it was possible to be with him but it wasn’t everything to her anymore. She started to see her own worth again and she stopped berating herself for how she had behaved. Let’s face it, most of us have chased after a person at some point in our lives. Yes, you feel like an idiot when it goes south but I guarantee you that it will bother you more than it bothers the other person. Whilst you’ll concern yourself about it, they’ll have moved past it and probably never think about it again.

So you see, in both cases, detachment to a point had come into it. Each put themselves above the other person finally and took hyper-focus away from the situation. They were no longer observing the 3D and considering it to be sub-standard. They let it be and found a way to dilute those feelings of attachment.

I totally respect experimentation and pushing the bounds of coffee. Sometimes that’s going to result in extremes that don’t work for everyone. I used to be a beer geek before becoming a coffee nerd and I imagine the craft beer community followed similar trends. That is, some brewers went nuts with crazy styles and adjuncts, while others just want to brew the classics right.

I probably fall somewhere in the middle in terms of tastes - still love a South American washed, but am enjoying the funky naturals as well. This world of weird ferments is pretty new to me though.

You took your first, long-awaited step into the dining hall. Nano was slightly ahead of you, leading the charge. There were so many new vampires to meet and possibly greet but the first thing you were greeted by was an array of wonderful smells. The aroma struck you in the nose and in your eyes like a match struck in the dark. Where would your spongy eyes even start? Well. You were like a Pup Named Scooby-Doo, soaking the whole thing up. It was a very large room. Basically, what you’d expect if you stepped inside of the banquet hall of a luxury hotel. Just imagine the look of shock in the eyes of a friend or loved one if you grabbed them and kind of shoved them through the door and into this showy room without warning. That’s the look and feeling that gripped you.

The room’s rich and royal red, gold, and white color pallet was a total feast for the eyes. There were various treasures on display, ranging from pricy purchases made at private auctions, to lethal ninja gear gained from conquest during past guild missions. It was all carefully strewn about the room by a master interior decorator. For starters, there was an antique grandfather clock on the front wall, behind the steam table with all the fresh food. The hefty clock was given to Marie’s mother as a wedding gift by one of their subservient houses.

There were several Victorian style cabinets placed in various spots along the walls. The gleam from a mirror with a solid gold frame caught your eye. It rested atop the marble mantle of the fireplace, which was built into the center of the wall on the west end. Also, atop the shelf, were two antique automaton wind-up dolls that must have cost a fortune, and here they were laying around, begging to be intentionally stolen by Lenda or unintentionally played with by Little Mary. In the back corner, along the wall that separated the kitchen from the dining hall, was a full set of Legate armor encased behind glass. To state that the suit-of-arms was fearsome would be an understatement. It was a wonder anyone... or anything could fit inside without being eviscerated.   

Nero and Lenda rushed to the front of the line. Luckily there was no one ahead of them, or he would’ve probably knocked them out of the way. Nothing could stand before a brute and a plate of warm food. The serving area was a buffet arrangement that was separated into three sections. The first section held a steam table that served both entrées and sides. The second was a display stand that held individual pastries, along with a table that held whole desserts, that had to be cut, such as pies, cobblers, or whatever planned panned sweet dishes the chefs had baked. The last area was a small salad and fruit bar. There was a table off to the side, so I suppose it was more like three and a half stations. It held all the utensils and condiments, as well as tea and coffee, along with an assortment of fresh drinks and a small wine selection.

All the red curtains had been pulled back to let in the evening darkness. It was always busy in the dining hall, but the evening repast was the busiest of them all. Chelsa and Eliza rushed in and out of the kitchen, using a door that connected the two rooms somewhere along the back wall. They were the tweenies for tonight and usually all the other nights. The two seemed to rather enjoy the experience, as well as the perks that came with working in the kitchen.

Tapestries hung from the wall, near all the windows. You could tell by the intricate patterns that they were probably more handwoven imports from a faraway place you probably had never even heard of. There were several one-tier chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. A grand multi-tiered one hung from the center and really maximized the lighting in the room without sacrificing style. The carpeted areas hid a bit too much of the wonderful roman mosaics. Behind the serving area, on the center of the front wall, hung a newly finished royal painting of the future count and countess. It was a very large canvas that showed them dressed in full regalia. Marie was holding a scepter and wearing a padded Hungarian crown, while Sensei was holding the bejeweled hilt of the sheathed ceremonial Sword of Blood while wearing the Crown of Undead.

You squirmed in a symbolic move, away from the portentous portrait, and pushed it along with all the other dark symbolisms out of your mind. Why Sensei was even wearing a crown made out of bones was one of the many questions to be asked during the end times. Right now, you were eager to see who was here and consume narration as if it were a delicious last meal. It was loud with chatter and laughter inside. Several vampires were sitting at an elongated table that sat up to twenty-four souls, while others sat with their friends at one of several tables for four.  

A blueblood noblewoman stood at the front of the steam table, and a blueblood maidservant, who looked like an older version of Little Mary, was waiting right next to it. They were there to chat and serve all the souls desiring an entrée or side dish. It was another one of those old vampire customs, where an aristocrat served the main courses to the “final meal.” It was an easy way to gain a rapport with the staff while also sneakily digging away at the fact that this robust meal had been provided to them for free by their generous patron.

For the maid or manservant tasked with serving alongside them, well, let’s just say the dig wasn’t as easy to miss. It was hard grave digging that pretty much threw dirt in their face and forced them to be humble in the knowledge that they were a retainer serving side dishes next to an aristocrat, who had the privilege of serving the main dishes.

Their act of charity was a labor dictated by New Faith doctrine. And trust me, the last thing any retainer wanted to do was not suck it up and draw the short straw when dealing with the rigid NWO power structure. Far easier to just get it over with and do the wicked work on the wrathful church’s “to-do list” than to not do it. Not only was it a headache for their patron, who had to explain to the local warlock why they harbored recusants, but it was also just a really bad idea to ~~cross~~ the anti-church. It was one of the fastest ways to get noticed by the Dark Order, their feared military wing, for all the wrong reasons. Doctrine stated that retainers in the custody of a royal household must take turns serving the “Last Meal.”

Self-sacrifice was a great way to gain something the dark clergy referred to as “unholy virtue.” Legend has it, Dracula was the first vampire to do so when he served bread to Lyrael and the other ten vampire lords at the supposed Undead Supper. A sort of “Last Meal” that was more covenant than supper, that is believed to have happened way back when vampires were just getting their bearings as a race and society. The Devil brought all eleven of the original families together and laid down the rules to their new demonic vampiric feudal order, that was destined to rule the world from the shadows (the Illuminati).

You were greeted at the door by the head maid and the butler. Their job was to welcome anyone who walked through the door warmly. It was also their role to sort of stand, off to the side, and assist with the final meal wherever needed. Vampires in administrative or supervisory positions were a step up on the social rung from retainers and considered “lesser gentry.” It was very important for one of the “lessers” to be there to fill in at the main serving station on the occasion when their betters, blueblood aristocrats, were unavailable.

You watched Nero hold up the line with his gluttonous antics, asking for more and more, until he had a stack of food that could rival any all-you-can-eat plate stacker’s food-mountain work of art. Oh and Lenda, she wasn’t any better. All she did was laugh in ravenous amusement while egging him on as if they were partners in crime. When it was her turn to be served, she begged them off. Telling the lady in the business attire that her plate was reserved for sweets.

That same lady, who Lenda had just rebuffed, greeted you with a friendly smile and a firm handshake. “Hi. I’m Elizabeth Carnot. Controller for the Báthory Estate. Nice to meet you.” After shaking your hand, she realized her mistake. She had skipped over Nano. This made her nervous, considering only a select few even knew what to make of him. Was he even an “him”? She pondered while wiggling a dinner plate around in her hands until she finally introduced herself to this killing machine, “Um. Hello… W-what’s your name, again? Hope I’m not stepping on your toes by asking. If I am sorry in advance.”

“Greetings, vampire named Elizabeth Carnot. No, you are not stepping on my toes. Considering the fact that you are standing at a safe distance would make doing so physically impossible—unless you are a level five threat on my combat module, which is something my initial readings do not suggest. \[Pause\] \[Loading...\] Vampire-human greeting: I am... *Exterminator:* XX-07-01-097XT. Annihilator Model \[XNT\],” he said with flashing eyes.

Elizabeth paused for a second to take a breath. Then she told him, “Thank you.” You could tell she was screaming on the inside while trying to play it cool on the outside. She looked over at you and kinda huffed out, “Would you like something to eat? Poor thing... can’t even talk. Tell you what I’ll do. I’ll give you a little bit of everything. That way you can eat whatever you want.”

“I do not require sustenance,” Nano said before she could ask.

She gave him the plate she was holding and said, “Just in case.”

“Thank you. I accept your symbolic gesture,” he told her.

“Please, call me, Lizzy, both of you. It’s what everyone else says—when they’re not trying to get me to make a new purchase,” she smirked while grabbing you a fresh plate. Then she motioned towards the food. The smell of the two entrees alone was enough to ward away modesty. “Looks pretty good right? Okay, well, let me tell you what we got...”   

The first entrée was a pan of smoked salmon that had been freshly seared and then glazed in honey sauce. Next was the “plat principal,” or main dish. It was the big-ticket item offered to staff and visitors as a thing of prestige. The higher the quality of the dish the more bragging rights a noble had during their own private dinner parties amongst peers, called (royal) gatherings. The main dish for today was roast beef marinated in blood. The dish came with Yorkshire pudding, which were these small puffs made from flour and milk that were cooked in a pan, underneath the roast. This allowed the savory juices from the meat, that had been lathered in blood, to fall onto the tasty popovers. Vampires loved them, especially the children.   

The Báthory house had made something of a name for itself amongst aristocratic circles for always serving a red meat that had been “dipped in blood” for supper. At the last gathering, Marie named the new custom as the blood relevé, since everyone kept asking, since it was now synonymous with her and had spread to all the other clans who could afford the hefty price tag that came with serving high quality cuts soaked in human blood.

The aroma was arguably the greatest thing to a vampire, and probably the strangest thing to a human. As macabre as it sounds, humans who wanted to “fit in,” or fancied themselves as future converts, found these bizarre blood dishes rather flavorful. Would you be one of their followers? Or would you turn your nose at the dish? It was a choice between angels and devils. An offer as stygian as it was enlightening. Like lightning you could hear and fear... like a child startled awake by a violent thunderstorm in the middle of a particularly caliginous night.  

Lizzy’s hand shook as if the dinner plate was made from steel. She kept stealing glances at Nano, clearly unnerved by his uncanny-valley appearance. She gave you a portion of salmon and told you that she would have someone bring you over a portion of the roast beef on a separate saucer. She thanked you and Nano before sending you off to the maidservant.

“Good evening. Mr. Nano and Neutral Observer. I’m Daiomi. I was told to give you a small portion of nearly everything,” she said with a tired smile. Exasperated or not, her expression was still cheery and welcoming. Her earrings, necklace, and bracelet stood out. Retainers received a monthly pittance for their services at the beginning of every month. Certainly not enough to afford lavish jewels. Oh, and she was most certainly Little Mary’s mother. The resemblance was uncanny. Speaking of Little Mary... where was she? And who was her father? Before you could riddle yourself to death, Nano’s voice startled you like a short circuit.

“Hello, vampire name Daiomi Oasis. It is an *inevitability* to meet you.”

“Thank you,” she said with a sympathetic smile.

“I believe we met your aggregate child code?”

“Oh dear,” Daiomi said in exasperation once more, “Unblessed souls. I told that wicked vampling to leave you be. I swear. I can’t take my eyes off the girl for a second without, huh, speaking of the devil...” the intonation in her voice turned into a worried gander. Her shoulders relaxed when she saw her coloring quietly like a good little child over at one of the tables in the back. She was with Ralphie, who was another child of naughty disposition, and the resident dark priest, who was a decent vampire, if not a little pushy when it came to pushing dark doctrine.

""Let them drink lukewarm tap,"" says Acting Efficiency Czar Musk.

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In a bold move that stunned sleepy bureaucrats across the capital, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) issued an internal directive early Friday ordering the immediate disposal of all coffee, creamer, and adjacent morale-boosting beverages from federal buildings.

“We’ve run the numbers,” said DOGE Acting Czar Trent Halberd, speaking into a cold mug of what used to be coffee. “Americans are tired of inefficiency. Tired of waste. Tired of jittery government employees spending 11 minutes stirring oat milk. This ends now.”

Witnesses describe widespread panic in agencies ranging from the USDA to NASA as security guards wheeled out kegs of Maxwell House and confiscated mini-fridges stocked with Coffee Mate hazelnut.

“First they took our standing desks, now this?” said one IRS analyst while hoarding a secret stash of freeze-dried espresso powder. “If DOGE really wants efficiency, maybe don’t take away the one thing that prevents me from crying on Form 8949.”

President Trump responded to criticism of the caffeine crackdown, tweeting: “Coffee is for closers. Feds aren’t closers. DOGE knows what it’s doing. Bigly savings coming soon!”

Sources say the move is part of a larger initiative dubbed “Operation Sober Patriot,” which also seeks to replace office snacks with dehydrated carrot sticks and ban all mugs that say “Don’t talk to me until I’ve had my coffee.”

I normally mix 1 tablespoon of cacao powder, currently Navitas, with hot water and sometimes coffee made in a moka pot. Occasionally, I'll use instant NesCafe. I find the cacao + coffee has nice synergy.

I mixed a packet of the CocoaVia with hot water and some moka pot coffee and drank it before breakfast. After about an hour, i definitely felt more alert and awake.

The effects were more noticeable than just mixing plain cacao with coffee.

1jwsc5q,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1jwsc5q/is_having_a_conversation_the_best_activity_for_a/,"Is ""having a conversation"" the best activity for a first date?","Most first dates are going for coffee, a walk, maybe getting a cocktail. I like this. It seems reasonable and leaves plenty of time for getting to know each other, and is neither expensive nor time-consuming. By ""get to know each other"" I mean have a mutual conversation about your backgrounds, your travels, your jobs, your musical preferences, a few amusing anectodes about each of you, etc. But maybe that is my bias, and dudes don't view conversation as the point of a date at all.

I've noticed that a nonzero number of first dates proposed by men feel less like dates to me, and more like tandem play requests. It is only a ""date"" insofar as the woman is free to join them in what they'd already be doing anyway. Like, a man will say, ""Let's go hiking"" to a girl. He expects any conversation during the hike to be primarily about hiking, and that's the date. As far as he's concerned, knowing his hobbies \*is\* getting to know him. He's ""a guy who hikes"" and he's looking for ""a girl who hikes.""

Again, maybe this is my bias, but I tend to view the hobbies as a side note. They can be fun, sure, but they aren't \*who I am\* by a long shot. For example, I play a certain game competitively, at the tournament level. But it would never even occur to me to limit a prospective dating field to ONLY men who also play that game. On the contrary, I'd much rather have a relationship with someone who has no connection to that world at all, but does have connections to other ones. That broadens both our horizons.

It gets a little worse when men get irritable about it, like when their preferred activity isn't interesting to the girl, especially if this happens more than once with different girls. He will start complaining about how girls never agree to join them on hikes alone through the woods, despite him being a hiking guy, or alone at his apartment for a first date where he will definitely impress her with his cooking skills. These guys aren't homicidial maniacs, but they might not really be interested in the girl, either. They might want to just show someone they are good at something? Or one guy asked me to accompany him to a big annual beer festival in our city. It was at the wicked hot peak of summer, and between the manure smell, the flies, the crushing crowd, nowhere to sit down, sweaty pits and the mud all over my shoes and socks from a recent heavy rain on unpaved paths, I couldn't even enjoy the beer, let alone the prospect of romance. The ultimate point was that he wanted to do the activity so very much. He treasured it every year. He enjoyed it. So why shouldn't I?

What is that? Is that solipsism? Myopia? Autism? I don't know. I'm just not sure if we can build a whole relationship based only on the hobbies we enjoy. I feel like getting to know somebody requires an understanding of the two people's respective thoughts, feelings, relationships with family, intelligence, hopes and dreams for the future and tons of other more nuanced elements, which requires lots of talking, not simply exhibiting how you choose to spend free time. Does that make sense? Do you agree?",1,1744384562.0,dating,1,0.67,False

We’ve been living together three years and while I didn’t really understand the breakup there had been significant tension and a big issue communicating with each other. As rent is extremely expensive in my area it has been taking some time to get  the money for an apartment while still paying bills where I am. 

We went over a month without any interaction whatsoever. As time as gone on everything has softened and in the past two weeks it has become clear that she regrets breaking up. I love her very much but this the point where it gets complicated. 

I met someone and we ended up sleeping together. While I though this would make me feel better or help me move on it has very much been the opposite. I feel disgusted with myself for having unprotected sex with a stranger. We’ve remained in communication somewhat and while I am being tested there is no reason to believe any stds are an issue and she is on birth control. 


 Since this happened my ex has suddenly regained her interest in me and is now wanting to spend time together( having dinner after work, watching tv, drinking coffee in the morning). I can see each time that I look at her I can see very clearly that she still loves me and it seems that she is trying to foster a connection to rebuild our relationship. Since sleeping with this other person I have been absolutely overcome with guilt. I cannot shake the feeling that I’ve done something very wrong. I feel as though I’ve cheated even though we are not together, we have not discussed being together, we have had absolutely no physical contact. I find myself wishing that I’d not done this.

And mind you these both are literally 90% identical to me. 
Firstly, I don't smell coffee, vanilla in both, to my notes it's more about jasmine, florals and green woody notes. 
Surprisingly I smell 'sounf' type smell in the YSL  one. Lmk if you guys also smell it ? Paris corner does not have that sounf smell or very very light. 
Other than that these too are very identical. 
It's fresh jasmine & orange blossom dominant. I can smell some woodyness as well that might be due to licorice and cedarwood. 
I think it will work so nice for summer nights as there's no sweetness or anything cloying. 
Idk why but paris corner is better lasting than the og. 
There's no depth or that intenseness I expected in it. So kinda disappointed here after spending huge price 😭 
But if you're going for corporate dinner, or some official event this will suit perfectly for that occasion. You can pull it off for date nights too but there are still better options. 
If anyone is blind buying the OG or planning I would suggest please don't buy, else get the paris corner only if you want this type of smell. 

Rating - 5/10 for both

1jws90f,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1jws90f/does_coffee_improve_energy_levels_and_mental/,Does coffee improve energy levels and mental alertness?,"Yes, **coffee does improve energy levels and mental alertness**—and there's a good amount of science to back that up. Let’s break it down in a detailed and simple way to help you understand how it works and why it happens.

 

# ☕ What’s in Coffee That Boosts Energy?

The primary active ingredient in coffee responsible for its energizing effects is **caffeine**. It’s a natural stimulant found not only in coffee but also in tea, chocolate, and some soft drinks or medications. Coffee contains a **moderate to high amount of caffeine**, which affects your brain and nervous system.

 

# ��How Caffeine Works in Your Brain

Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how caffeine boosts your energy and mental alertness:

# 1. Blocks Adenosine

 

Your brain naturally produces a chemical called **adenosine** that promotes relaxation and sleepiness.

As the day progresses, adenosine levels build up, making you feel tired.

**Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors**, which stops the sleepy signal from reaching your brain.

This makes you feel **more awake and alert**.

 

# 2. Stimulates the Central Nervous System

 

Caffeine triggers the release of neurotransmitters like **dopamine**, **norepinephrine**, and **serotonin**.

These chemicals improve your mood, increase alertness, and make you feel more energetic.

 

# 3. Enhances Brain Function (Cognition)

 

Studies show that caffeine can **enhance various aspects of brain function**, including:

 

**Memory**

**Reaction time**

**Focus**

**Attention span**

**Mental clarity**

 

 

# ��Scientific Evidence

Here are some scientific findings that support coffee’s role in boosting energy and alertness:

 

**A study published in “Psychopharmacology”** found that caffeine significantly improved attention, alertness, and reaction time in sleep-deprived individuals.

**Harvard Health Publishing** notes that caffeine improves short-term brain function, especially in people who are tired or mentally fatigued.

The **FDA** states that up to 400 mg of caffeine per day (about 4–5 cups of coffee) is generally safe for healthy adults and effective for increasing wakefulness.

 

 

# ��How Fast Does Coffee Work?

 

Caffeine begins to work **within 15 to 45 minutes** after consumption.

Peak effects are usually felt within **30 to 60 minutes**.

 

The stimulating effects can last **3 to 5 hours**, depending on your metabolism, age, and overall health.

 

# ⚖️ Does Everyone Respond the Same?

Not exactly. How caffeine affects you depends on factors like:

**Your body size and metabolism**

 

**How much caffeine you regularly consume**

**Genetics** (some people metabolize caffeine faster than others)

**Sleep habits and stress levels**

 

Some people might feel jittery, anxious, or have trouble sleeping if they consume too much.

 

# ☕ How Much Coffee is Ideal for Mental Alertness?

A moderate amount of coffee is generally enough to boost mental alertness without side effects. This means:

**1 to 2 cups (95–200 mg of caffeine)** for a mild boost

**3 to 4 cups (200–400 mg of caffeine)** for stronger effects (safe for most adults)

 

 

# ��When Coffee Might Not Help

While coffee helps most people stay alert, there are times when it might not be as effective:

**Chronic sleep deprivation**: If you’re extremely tired, caffeine might offer only short-term help.

**Overuse**: Drinking too much coffee can lead to **caffeine tolerance**, reducing its energizing effects.

**Dependency**: Some people become reliant on caffeine to function normally, which can be unhealthy.

 

# ✅ Benefits Beyond Energy and Alertness

Coffee not only keeps you awake—it can also support:

**Improved exercise performance**

**Mood enhancement**

**Reduced risk of cognitive decline** (long-term benefits)

**Increased productivity**

 

 

# ��Summary: Yes, Coffee Improves Energy and Mental Alertness

||
||
|**Effect**|**How Coffee Helps**|
|Reduces tiredness|Blocks adenosine receptors|
|Increases focus|Boosts dopamine and norepinephrine|
|Improves memory & reaction|Stimulates brain activity|
|Enhances mood|Releases feel-good neurotransmitters|
|Speeds up response time|Activates central nervous system|

 

# ��‍♀️ FAQs About Coffee and Mental Alertness

# Q1: How long does the energy boost from coffee last?

**A:** Typically 3 to 5 hours, depending on your body and how much you drank.

# Q2: Can decaf coffee improve alertness?

**A:** Not really. Decaf contains very little caffeine, so it doesn’t have the same stimulating effect.

# Q3: Is caffeine better in coffee than in energy drinks?

**A:** Yes. Coffee provides caffeine without excessive sugar or artificial ingredients often found in energy drinks.

# Q4: What’s the best time to drink coffee for energy?

**A:** Between 9:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m., when your cortisol levels start to dip.

# Q5: Can drinking coffee daily reduce its effectiveness?

**A:** Yes. Your body can develop a tolerance, so it might take more coffee to get the same effect over time.",1,1744384341.0,coffee_kitchen,0,1.0,False

We met for a coffee, it went fun, light and casual. Since then we have been talking on and off, including 2-3 long phone calls ( 2-2.5 hours long). Our conversations started with mainly gossiping about common friends and slowly it's going deep, about us and the breakup. Although I am acting like I've moved past the phase but I still want him.Yesterday he also mentioned that, he had missed me during the nc, but he added that it's very normal to miss someone with whom you used to talk regularly and then suddenly going to nc. 

Now the problem is all the 3 calls were initiated by me. While he engages himself  pretty well during the call and initiates many things and elongates the calls, also says that he was thinking about calling me but has been busy with work etc but never calls himself. I can't figure out what does he want. He's playing it very cool, with no urgency. It's making me confused that if he really wants something or he's just being polite/ wanting a friendship kind of a thing. 

P.s- we broke up after dating for 7 months because he was not currently thinking about the long term because of his unstable career condition, whereas I was getting attached and wasn't happy with the 'short term' commitment.

Someone who likes to laugh is key – and let's be honest, **a great smile definitely brightens up a conversation!** If we click and conversations flow well, maybe grabbing a coffee sometime could be cool, but definitely no pressure – just looking for a chat buddy first and foremost.

1jws8cd,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiveBeforeYouDie/comments/1jws8cd/dollywood_in_pigeon_forge_tennessee_hello_dolly/,"Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee!   Hello Dolly!","**The town of Pigeon Forge, Tennessee is a bit like Branson, Missouri but with a catchier name.  Within the city limits of this fine community there is just a regular slew of fun filled, family-oriented stuff to do!  Such a slew consists of live music shows, dinner theaters, and the place is an absolute Mecca of miniature golf.  I pretty much spotted one of the sacred courses in every direction I looked.  Pigeon Forge is also on the edge of the Smoky Mountain National Park which delighted me even more!  With great anticipation, I had hopes that Margo and I could find a nice campsite and have our tent pitched within the hour.  Well, this would remain a mere notion because that wasn’t going to happen.  My wife Margo had other plans a brewing.**

**You see, Pigeon Forge is also the home of Dollywood.  In Margo’s mind, we may never come this way again, so we’d better take advantage of such a, once in a lifetime, experience.  Although I was bit miffed about putting off my encounter with the Great Smokie Mountains, I was enamored by the fact that Margo was actually excited about going to an amusement park.  Normally, nothing short of an act of God would persuade the little woman to partake in a full day of overpriced food and spine jolting, stomach churning rides. This was indeed a once in a life time experience, so there was no way I was passing up on such.  So, after eighteen holes of miniature golf, a stop by Baskin Robbins, and a night at an economic, but decent motel we were off for our day at Dollywood!**

**Dollywood, nestled in the hills of eastern Tennessee, is similar to Six Flags Over Texas which is nestled in the Texas Rangers and Dallas Cowboys land of Arlington, Texas.  The main difference is that the food is better and Dollywood has a lot more trees and a lot more…well, a lot more Dolly!  It’s a one stop Dolly shop for all your Dolly Parton needs and/or desires.  There’s even a Dolly museum that is just loaded with all kinds of fascinating Dolly trivia, Dolly dresses, Dolly pictures, Dolly posters, Dolly’s awards, and Dolly, Dolly, Dolly!  Yes, reminders that Dolly Parton is one of the greatest music legends from Tennessee were posted everywhere!  Her movie career, her music career, and even her TV days back on the old Porter Wagoner show were on display.  Well, hello Dolly!**

**I got roped in by so much “Dolly” that I kept my eyes peeled for an exhibit that might display Dolly’s first training bra because we longtime fans know that the pretty lady is gifted with far more than just musical talent.  I thought it might be tucked in with her Grammy’s but no such luck.  I figured with the lady’s sense of humor such an exhibit might be a tough one to resist.  But the museum is pretty impressive and well worth the time, and it’s certainly something you won’t find at any Six Flags Park.  And even if Dolly decided to keep her juvenile undergarments to herself, there is a music show that displays the talents of her sisters, brothers, nieces, cousins, and any other out of work relative who might have shown up on her doorstep claiming to possess some kind of musical talent.  In all reality, it’s a pretty good show.  They all come out and sing and talk about Dolly while a giant video screen of Dolly plays behind them.  The video of Dolly watches them while giving a few nods and smiles as if she’s part of the conversation.  Not a bad idea actually.  I’m thinking of using this practice as well.  Instead of actually going to holiday, family gatherings, I’ll just send a video along.  Like Dolly, I’ll be on the TV screen and just nod and smile, which is about all I do anyway.  Good plan there, Dolly!**

**As I watched this musical show I was left with the question, “What do you do if you’re a Dolly relative and possess no musical talent?”  Come to think of it, the guy telling me where to park in the parking lot did have an uncanny resemblance to Dolly Parton.  So, here’s a thought to consider.  If you have a relative who is a huge, famous music star you might want to learn how to play guitar or something.  Indeed, something to think about.**

**Now this “Family of Dolly” show or “Dolly Kin” or whatever the heck it was called is not the only music show offered at Dollywood.  Oh, heavens no, for this is Tennessee, the home of country music which means the place is overpopulated with wannabe music stars who have traveled to Nashville to become the next Dolly Parton or Garth Brooks or Reba McEntire, or Clint Black or someone who’s a bit more current.  Roughly translated, there are tons of near homeless, young country singers whose self-respect has dissolved to the point where they consider being a performer at an amusement park as a step UP!  We found such a group of these singers at some theater that Margo had instructed me to locate while she shopped for tee shirts.  Low and behold, I did find the indoor theater, and after buying a bag of popcorn from some kid who looked a bit like Dolly Parton, I was ready for the show!** 

**Even for an old rocker like me, I found this country show to be pretty cool, and there was a lot of talent on that stage!  Indeed, all these promising country crooners lit up the stage with their big smiles and good hair while belting out a bunch of current country hits.  Of course, I’m only guessing these were current country hits because I had never heard of any of them.  After these youngsters did their thing, the assumed highlight of the show was some legendary, country artist who came out to sing his past and present greatest hits.  His name was…. well, I haven’t the foggiest idea.  I had never heard of him.  I’m guessing finding legendary country stars, who are actually legendary, to perform daily at Dollywood is probably a bit of a challenge.  I doubt if George Strait is returning their phone calls.  However, the show was certainly worth the time, and I’m sure the country hits that these attractive youngsters performed were actually hits, and the legendary country star might have even been a legitimate country music legend.  Or maybe he was just one of Dolly’s distant cousins that they couldn’t work into Dolly’s family show.**

**After looking through a few tourist shops that were being run by folks who looked a little like Dolly Parton (Nieces? Nephews? Seventh cousins?) we were off to another country show.  This show was a tribute to the country classics.  You know, the old stuff.  And this time, I knew every song they sang.  So, what’s that say about me?  Have I become a classic?  Scary, huh?  No, that wasn’t scary. The true terror for the day came about when I entered the small, outdoor theater and saw this lady in front of the stage dressed up as a Dollywood Mini Pearl playing a small banjo.  Not scary?  Well, it quickly became quite frightening when she called me up to the front of the theater.**

**“Don’t sit down,” she called out to me.  “You come right up here!”  When a woman dressed like Minnie Pearl and playing a toy banjo calls you up to the front of a theater at an amusement park, there’s usually nothing good coming from that ordeal.  The lady didn’t strike me as one who would take no for an answer, so I proceeded to fulfill her wishes.  “My, you’re a long, tall Texan,” she exclaimed when I told her that we had come from the Lone Star state.** 

**Then things got worse as she pulled out a rubber chicken hat which she wanted me to wear.  Like I said before, nothing good was coming out of this ordeal.  Oh, what the heck.  I was in front of an audience so I figured that I might as well make a good performance of it.  With this in mind, I bent down on one knee as if I was being knighted by the Queen of England and accepted the rubber chicken hat with a great since of nobility and dignity.  Then, of course, things got even worse.  She wanted me to dance as she sang.  Instead of resisting, I came to the realization, “Just how often does one get a chance to dance in public while wearing a rubber chicken on their head and not get arrested?”  With that in mind, my performance began.**

**With the high kicks of a New York chorus line, I dove into the act.  As the song progressed, I bent down and tried to carry out some traditional Russian kicks with deep knee bends, commonly known as Prisiadki!  However, that didn’t go so well.  Such a dance move can be most challenging while trying to keep a rubber chicken on your head.  Indeed, coming up with the right choreography for a dance that includes holding your hands in your arm pits and flapping them like chicken wings is quite difficult to pull off on the spur of the moment as well.  However, I was still able to carry out what I will consider my best dance routine with a banjo accompaniment while wearing a rubber chicken hat.  Such was a performance that left some members of the audience sitting in silent awe.** 

**Margo said that my performance would be, with little doubt, the greatest rubber hat chicken dance that would take place on that particular day at Dollywood.  I don’t get many compliments from my wife, so when the heavens open and one happens to rain down upon me, I hardly take it lightly.  I will forever regard this rubber chicken hat performance at Dollywood as one of my life’s greatest moments.  As for the banjo playing Mini Pearl, her name is Miss Lillian and is known in some circles as “The Chicken Lady.”  If anyone ever makes it out to Dollywood, be sure to look for her.  But here’s a warning.  Be prepared to perform.  I realize that I’ve set the bar pretty high for future rubber chicken hat dancers but do what you can!**

**One of the greatest attractions of Dollywood that sets it aside from most amusement parks is the food!  The place actually has real food!  Real food such as good old Southern cooking, complete with fried chicken, potatoes and gravy, corn on the cob, and green beans.  After a hardy chicken dance one does tend to work up an appetite.  The place that Margo and I chose to eat was a place called the Chicken Coop.  I came to this realization after noticing all the chicken wire surrounding the dining area.  At first, I found all the wire to be a bit strange, but then it dawned on me, “It’s a chicken coop!”  Other than the food and the wire, all I really remember about the place was the server who kept coming by our table and telling us how tired she was.  What was she complaining about?  I didn’t see her doing a highly, energetic chicken dance.  She did resemble Dolly a little though.  A distant cousin, perhaps.  Interestingly enough, she was dressed in authentic, early pioneer, Appalachian woman garb from the 1800’s, complete with a bonnet and long dress.  I noted that her costume must be a trifle bit warm to wear in the May heat.  To this comment she responded with, “What costume?”** 

**Other than all the Dolly stuff, country music shows, and an awesome rubber chicken hat dancer (limited engagement), Dollywood does have some pretty amazing rides.  The highlight for me was their main thrill, chill, jolt, and bolt ride, The Wild Eagle!  I’m not sure how it would compare to the Titan rollercoaster back home in Texas, but the Wild Eagle is a wild ride indeed!  It’s especially wild when you have an angry woman sitting next to you.  Apparently, I had forgotten to ensure that Margo was safely secured in her seat before I strapped myself in, and she was quite peeved that that I hadn’t performed a twelve-point safety check on her security.  Really peeved!  Once I had buckled myself in, I was stuck and couldn’t move.  Her safety was then left up to some high school kid who came by and did a quick check on all of us, but in Margo’s mind, it was MY DUTY AND MY DUTY ALONE to secure her safety for the Wild Eagle!  I guess I lost my code of chivalry after the chicken dance.**

**One last note concerning Dollywood.  Amongst all the Dolly stuff there was a remake of the house that Dolly Parton grew up in.  This is a sight which even the most casual of Dolly fans should not ignore.  The house only had two rooms, and Dolly was the fourth of the family’s twelve kids.  Okay, so does that mean all the kids and parents slept in the same room?  Such a notion makes one wonder about the conception of the later kids.  Yup, that just doesn’t sound right at all.**

**After a quick purchase of a Dollywood coffee cup, magnet, pin, and a lecture from the cashier regarding her admiration toward Alec Baldwin, we were done with Dollywood.  I was on to discover more excitement in Pigeon Forge!  Oh yes, we were off to check out the live theater, live music acts, live…oh forget it.  Margo wanted to play more miniature golf.** ",1,1744384295.0,LiveBeforeYouDie,0,1.0,False

I just got this sofa a few days ago (1st & 2nd pic), but I’m realizing I really miss having a chaise.

I can easily return it and swap it out for the same model ***with*** a reversible chaise.

Do you think the version with the chaise (2nd, 3rd & last pic) would look better or make more sense?

*Or*… is there such a thing as 20-inch high pouf ottomans that have that cozy bean bag feel? That could be a good option to keep the space more open!Also wondering:

* What kind of coffee table (and shape) would work best here? Or should I just keep the one I have?
* Should I consider changing the TV stand?

\--

I will be sharing my detailed experience of how my entire process at medical MEPS went, so that those who are interested or curious about this process may have a better idea of what to expect.

I completed the ASVAB approximately two weeks prior, so this time I was only going for the physical evaluation. For the test, I was taken the same day by my recruiter to the station, took the test, and was picked up afterward by the recruiter.

Please note that some people may have different experiences, especially when it comes to arriving at MEPS. Some drive themselves, a few are taken directly there by their recruiters, and others are taken to a hotel the day prior to then be bused the following morning. In my case, I was taken to a hotel the day before and then bused over the next morning.

# Day Zero: Hotel

**tl;dr** \- it’s always the same hotel as they are contracted with the DoD for quartering enlistees; hotel was nice, the room was nice and clean, the people were nice, the food was atrocious, bring your own food and water, a water bottle costs $5. Overall, boring as fuck.

I arrived at my recruiting station in the midafternoon, where my recruiter gave me more information on what to expect: no coffee, no sex or jerking off, and no drugs. Then I was taken to a Holiday Inn near Newark Airport. 

At check-in, they verify your information, inform you to check the room and report any issues—because if not, it’ll be considered your fault. They emphasize the rules, curfew, and the buddy system. Then you’re assigned a room and a keycard. 

I found that my roommate was already there, checking for any inconsistencies. He was a chill guy. We talked about random stuff and life.

At dinner, we went downstairs and found mediocre microwaved food and crappy rice. I took one bite and threw the food away—disgusting. Free soda, and interestingly, no water… (I’m convinced they conspire to make us buy their $5 water bottles). 

After that, we just chilled in the room, each in our own bed with Netflix and social media. 

# Day 1: Actual MEPS & Physical Evaluation

**tl;dr** \- a lot of standing around, sitting, queuing; everyone was nice, chipper, upbeat and chill; only one lady was snarky and acted like she was tough shit but was nothing more than a receptionist; one other guy was just kind of an asshole to feel cool but he was the guy that picked up your piss so I guess he was just being pissy... Overall, a little boring but everyone is cracking jokes, you're always moving about.

My roommate and I woke up around 3:45 AM, before the ""courtesy call,"" and got ready. We did a final sweep and inspection of the room, then headed downstairs. We queued up to return the keycard as we entered the breakfast hall. The food was okay—nothing special. 

At around 5:00 AM, we were organized onto the buses, which promptly departed straight to Fort Hamilton.  
Around 5:30 AM, we arrived and were instructed to offboard in the following order and queue up in front of the entrance accordingly: those shipping out, those signing or enlisting and swearing in, those doing the physical, and lastly, ASVAB test takers.

We were then escorted inside for a simple security check. You had to place *all* electronic devices inside your bag, which would almost immediately be placed in an organized storage room (**¡YOU WON’T HAVE ACCESS TO IT AFTERWARDS—TAKE YOUR I.D., SOCIAL SECURITY CARD, AND PERTINENT DOCUMENTS WITH YOU!**).

Afterward, you formally check in by providing your I.D. and Social Security Number. You’re given a sticker name tag and sent to the Medical Evaluation Area (at Fort Hamilton, it’s on the second floor). Once on the second floor, you check in again. This time, they print out multiple small stickers with a barcode and your SSN; you’re asked to verify that each SSN is correct. One of those barcode stickers is placed on your name tag, and then you’re directed to follow the hallway down.

Just a few steps down the hallway, there are several blood pressure machines and chairs. You’re instructed to take a seat when one becomes available, where someone will place the cuff on your arm and record the results in their computer.

Then, you go into the adjacent room and are given a presentation detailing the day’s activities, expectations, rules, and regulations. They thoroughly explain how the physical will go, what counts as disqualifying, and they emphasize SHARP (sexual misconduct) **heavily**.

Then the following happens and in this order (at Fort Hamilton):

1. Check In
2. Blood Pressure
3. Presentation/Welcome Chat
4. Breathalyzer: yes, you blow into a breathalyzer and the value is recorded in your electronic file.
5. Hearing Test:  you press the button when you hear ANY sound. My friends say I'm deaf, but I passed with 100%
6. Vision Test: a light is shown into your eyes so they can see your pupils' reaction (the black part of your eye); colorblind test, then you look into a machine that looks like a microscope that has a vision cart inside of it (the one with all the letters and numbers) and you read the letters/numbers out loud to determine your vision
7. Height & Weight: you stand on a scale without shoes, and your height is measured. They look at a chart and if you're overweight they take you to a private part of the room where they measure your neck, chest, abdomen, and waist. I did see that the obviously high BMI guys continued with their physical, but I don't know what happens if you fail height-weight standards...
8. Urine: You line up outside the bathroom and enter 8-persons at a time. There is a wall with 4 urinals on each side of that wall. You have to stand about 1-2 feet away from the urinal, whip the little guy out then piss in the cup. You can then place the piss-filled-cup on top of the urinal if you must continue voiding. Yes, you will see other people's junk, it's as uncomfortable for everyone as it is for you but whatever... it's only like 20 seconds, also the guy assigned to ""observe"" is cracking jokes and talking about his crazy war stories, very very chill guy. You then hand the urine sample through a small window connected to a lab.
9. Blood Sample: You line up to get your blood taken... I mean... pretty straight forward. Very nice nurses.
10. Physical Examination: The doctor was neither rude nor nice, more of ""I gotta be here today and do this so let's just get it done"" type vibes. He asked me: do I take any meds, any previous surgeries, broken bones, any mental/psych issues, have I ever been expelled from school. Then you undress down to your boxers or tighty-whiteys for the actual physical. -- Yes, you have to do the duck walk. My doctor simply said ""ok. now do the duck walk."" and I took like 3-4 steps before he told me to stop and stand up. He looked at my tattoo and analyzed it's meaning. You do a bunch of stretches. Then you SIT on the little bed, he listens to your heart and lungs, checks your ears and eyes. Then you LIE down; he palpates your belly, checks your inguinal area. As you're laying down, he asks you to lower your underwear where he'll check your penis quickly and rolls your dickskin back. Then you stand up, with underwear still down, he checks your manberries. And finally, the best part, what we've all been waiting for, what our tax dollars pay for: **he checks your butthole**. After all that he instructs you to wash your hands and dress up. Meanwhile he's telling you that everything is good, and you finished everything, to then go to the main desk where you'll be sent to the liaison's office.

\--

Normally you go to the liaison's office where you discuss and sign your contract and are given a departure date. In my case, I need to provide a medical report that my recruiter forgot to upload; the doctor explicitly told me ""You just need this document to be submitted. You are not disqualified. You just need to provide this report to be fully integrated and qualified. Once submitted you're in.""

Then my recruiter came and picked me up.

And I have come to believe that's what they deserve,"I went to my local coffee shop this morning and saw a group of retired people sitting around for their morning coffee circle. I've been going to this place for years, off and on, and seeing them made me think of a similar group that had been there when I first started going there and one if its members, we'll call him Todd

Todd was a retired Vietnam vet, car enthusiast, and hardcore conservative. This was not long after Obama got elected and conservatives, Todd included, lost their damn mind about it.

Todd and I talked a few times and he was generally a decent guy, right until he brought up politics. And he ALWAYS brought up politics. I would go to the shop most mornings to do some work. Occasionally I would see Todd and he'd say hello, but he invariably made some political comment like ""Did you see what *El Presidente* did yesterday?""or something like that. I usually had no idea what he was talking about generally, but from what I gathered it was whatever talking point Fox News told his kind to get mad about that day, which he inevitably did. I mostly just humored the guy as he seemed harmless and our interactions were always brief

Well one day I see Todd come in with a lady. They sat together, had coffee, then left. Then I saw it a few other times. I was happy for the guy. I knew he was a widower, that his daughter lived far away, and that he lived alone. I assumed they were dating and they looked like they got along

Eventually Todd came without his girlfriend and we chatted. I told him I saw him with a lady a few times and he said that was a gal he was dating but not anymore. I said I was sorry to hear that as she seemed nice. He says ""Well, me too. But she told me she voted for Hussein and I told her she had to go."" Then he pantomimed her crying and gave a half smirk and a laugh before the conversation turned elsewhere

A few months later I heard that Todd died at home. Apparently his corpse lay there for several days before anyone decided to check on him. One of the other members of the oldies group said that his funeral was nice ""but not too many people came.""

 I wish I could say I was surprised by any of it

The guy could have spent his final days with someone. Could have enjoyed the company of a woman who enjoyed being around him. They could have been together. Maybe not a historical love affair, but comfort. Companionship. Someone to be around. Something other than the angry TV telling you to be angry

But he didn't. In the end he chose anger. He chose to be a fairly horrible dude. Laughing at his ex's tears when they broke up, hating the people the TV told him to hate, and going to his death with..what? The solace of spite? The comfort of feeling right? 

I have no idea how Todd lived most of his life. I also don't care. I know how he went to his death. And from what I can tell, in the end he reaped what he sowed

Blurb-Waking up as a sentient magic crystal buried underground wasn’t on **Ethan’s** to-do list. One minute, he was an engineer—designing factory assembly lines, optimizing production, and grumbling about deadlines. The next? He’s a glowing rock with instincts screaming at him to spawn monsters and hoard treasure.

**System Booting…**  
**Warning: Dungeon Assistant Not Present.**  
**Compensating…**  
**Memories Restored. Bonus Ability Granted.**

Oh. Well, that explains why he suddenly remembers coffee, spreadsheets, and why OSHA violations are a terrible idea. Instead of following the traditional dungeon route—traps, monsters, and being yet another EXP farm for adventurers—Ethan has a better idea. **Industrialization.**

Why summon goblins when you can build an **automated ore refinery?** Why rely on bats and slimes when you can engineer a **self-sustaining magical factory?** Who needs gold when you can **mass-produce enchanted goods and sell them to the surface world?**

Unfortunately, the local adventurers aren’t thrilled about a dungeon that doesn’t want to be looted, the kingdom isn’t sure what to make of a dungeon that pays taxes, and rival dungeons? They just want to eat him.

Armed with a **questionable system, an army of quirky golems, and the sheer stubbornness of an overworked engineer,** Ethan is about to prove that progress isn’t just for the surface world.

**If dungeons are supposed to be deadly, then why not make death an industry?**

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a credit card holder phone hinges on several crucial design and functional elements.

**Material Composition:**

The materials used in the construction of a credit card holder phone play a significant role in its durability and the level of security provided. Options range from hard polycarbonate plastic to flexible TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) and even premium leather. Models utilizing polycarbonate offer robust protection against impacts and scratches, safeguarding both the phone and the stored cards. TPU provides a more pliable and shock-absorbent choice, while leather options deliver a touch of elegance and sophistication. The choice ultimately depends on the user's preference for aesthetics, protection, and feel.

**Card Capacity and Security:**

The capacity of the credit card holder directly impacts the number of cards that can be conveniently carried, while security features are paramount in protecting sensitive financial facts. Some designs accommodate only one or two cards, prioritizing a slim profile, while others can securely hold up to five or six. Secure mechanisms, such as RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) blocking technology, are essential for preventing unauthorized scanning of credit card data. Mechanisms such as spring-loaded flaps,magnetic closures,or tight-fitting sleeves will prevent unintentional card slippage.

**Attachment Method:**

The method of attaching the credit card holder to the phone significantly affects its bulkiness and ease of use. Options include adhesive backing, which provides a seamless and low-profile integration even though they are frequently enough permanent. Others offer snap-on cases that integrate the card holder, offering a more secure and integrated design. Some models feature a worldwide elastic strap design that accommodates various phone sizes, but these may not offer the slimmest profile. Consider how seamlessly the attachment integrates with your phone's design and your need for easy removal or adjustment.

**Ease of Access:**

Swift and easy access to your credit cards is a primary benefit of using a credit card holder phone. Designs vary, with some featuring a simple slot for easy card insertion and removal, while others incorporate more elaborate mechanisms like sliding compartments or hinged doors. Models that allow users to quickly fan out their cards for easy selection are frequently enough preferable. The design should balance security with convenience, ensuring cards are held firmly in place while remaining readily accessible when needed.

**Overall design and Aesthetics:**

Aesthetics plays a crucial role in the appeal of a credit card holder phone, as it should complement the phone's design and reflect the user's personal style. Manufacturers offer a wide array of colors, materials, and finishes to suit different tastes. Some designs are minimalistic and understated, blending seamlessly with the phone, while others make a bolder statement with vibrant colors or textured surfaces. Consider how the card holder integrates with the overall look and feel of your phone.

## Core Benefits

A well-designed credit card holder phone can significantly enhance your daily life.

**Streamlined Convenience:** Eliminating the need to carry a separate wallet simplifies errands and reduces clutter.Instead of fumbling through a bulky wallet,you can quickly access your essential cards directly from your phone. Imagine effortlessly paying for your morning coffee or groceries with a simple tap of your phone, streamlining your checkout experience and freeing up your hands.

**Enhanced Security:** Manny credit card holder phones incorporate RFID blocking technology, protecting your cards from electronic theft.

## FAQs Section

**Are credit card holder phones bulky?**
The thickness of a credit card holder phone varies depending on the design and card capacity. Some models are designed to be as slim as possible, adding only a few millimeters of bulk, while others are more substantial. Consider your personal preference for size and ensure that the added bulk does not make the phone uncomfortable to hold or carry.

**Will the magnets in some credit card holder phones damage my credit cards?**
While older credit cards with magnetic stripes could be affected by strong magnets, most modern credit cards use EMV chips, which are not susceptible to magnetic damage. However, it's always a good practice to avoid exposing your credit cards to strong magnetic fields for extended periods. Many modern card holders use magnets for the flap to maintain a slim profile, and they are not strong enough to cause damage.

**Can I wirelessly charge my phone with a credit card holder case on it?**
Wireless charging compatibility depends on the design of the credit card holder case and the proximity of the cards to the charging coil. Some cases are specifically designed to allow wireless charging, while others require you to remove the cards or the entire case. Verify that the case is compatible with wireless charging before purchasing if this feature is critically important to you.

Well, the first Mass I went to, I brought my toddler with me. She is a little over a month away from turning 2, and for some reason ""Dress well for Church/Sunday Best"" always stuck with me when I myself was a child. Think I heard this in a movie? Regardless, this meant I had my daughter in a big red (\*cough\* Christmas-y) dress with her hair done all pretty. Previously when staking out Anglican/Baptist/Protestant churches, I have always taken one of my children with me. The way my children would be regarded is very important to me. This day was the first time entering a Catholic parish, as I got too curious about the ""other side"" of Christianity.

We sat in the second-front bench, and my daughter sat next to me for a time. Then she did what children do.. she made some noises, she stood on the chair and smiled at whoever was sitting behind us, and she started walking up and down the chairs. It was then time for Children's Liturgy (15-20 minutes of a 60 minute Mass), which she thoroughly enjoyed (like a woman at a tea party being told news by the gossiper. ""A girl was to be stoned \*gasp!\*.. because she was very bad \*OOOHHH!\*"").

Back to Mass, she rushed up to Father with the colouring in she did and yelled HERE YA GO!! after all the other children had their work looked at and prayed for. Then back to climbing all over the seats and into the front seats and so on.

I was nervous after that I might receive comments during the tea and coffee after. As that always happens. Nope! First I am approached by the receptionist of the parish who was utterly delighted by my daughter. Next was an older scottish bloke from Glasgow area (judging by accent) who said he felt nostalgic while watching my daughter over when his own were that old, and from when he used to assist with nursery liturgy during a mass at one of the parishes he attended back in Scotland. And from there I kept getting smiles, their own stories of kids during mass who would play, and how everyone loves it.

This is a large reason I am choosing to become Catholic. I never saw this acceptance and love for children when I attempted to attend other churches. If anything, they were sent off as soon as possible so the adults could sit and hear the preaches. Something which never fully sat well with me. Though I loved it as a kid, but to be completely honest the services at those churches were always a bit of a snore. Another thing which isn't an issue when I visit a Parish, at this time.

Daughter and I were one of the last ones to leave that day (She had a total of 4 glasses of apple juice and 5 biscuits, because they loved feeding her). It was an instant nod when I asked if she wished to return with me next week.",25,1744383315.0,Catholicism,9,1.0,False
1jwrtu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/fasting/comments/1jwrtu5/some_health_wins_for_those_fasting_for_health/,Some Health Wins for Those Fasting for Health,"Not sure if this post will go through because my previous ones have all disappeared, but I wanted to post some small wins. I've been doing 20:4 IF M-F since October mainly to help with various ""mysterious"" chronic illnesses (subclinical POTS, CFS/ME, fibromyalgia, adrenal insufficiency, EDS, longterm mycotoxin illness). I've always naturally done kind of a 16:8 fast because I'm never hungry in the morning (I do put a nominal amount of grass fed half'n'half in my coffee) so 20:4 has been easy for me (except the week before my period, I go easy on myself then). I noticed when I first did a 20:4 fast back in October that my energy stays steady throughout the day and much higher than normal, plus I find I'm just at the point of hungry healthy foods taste amazing and I don't go overboard stuffing myself with nuts and avocado or something. I've done a few extended dirty water fasts also, but I don't think my body in its current state (specifically the adrenal weakness) can handle more than a 40ish hour fast as I become lethargic, extra brain foggy, muscle achey despite lots of electrolytes + epsom salt baths, shaky and hot on day 4 every time, etc (it's not blood sugar). 

ANYWAY I have been seeing improvements all this time just doing 20:4 so I wanted to share:   
  
\-I am now able to exercise about 30 extra minutes a day in addition to a 30-45 minute walk  
\-My menstrual cycle has always been wildly unpredictable, but it's steadied out to a regular 32-36 day cycle with very little PMS symptoms  
\-I have been able to cut back on my hydrocortisone almost to nothing (was at 30 mg/day, I'm now at 5mg)  
\-Have been able to drop lots of supplements from my routine  
\-And the best part, I had bloodwork done at the beginning of April and I am finally back in the green for triglycerides AND my cholesterol ratio! I have been borderline hyperlipidemia for years because of all the stress my body has been under (my diet has been excellent my whole life, I grew up with mother who is a doctor of holistic nutrition) and this week my doctor was so excited to see my bloodwork.   
\-My fasting glucose also improved, but she hadn't started to worry about that yet  
  
(Also, I have lost about 14 lbs, which was not the goal but is a lovely bonus considering how much weight I gained being unable to exercise + being on steroids)

I am experimenting with ADF dirty fasting at the moment (not eating from around 8pm the night before, through the next day, until 4pm the next day, so around 44 hours, 3x/week) but allowing a couple cups of Swanson's Chicken bone broth + some good olives on the full fasting days in addition to the half'n'half in my coffee. I know the protein (about 8g/cup) dials down the autophagy, but I still think I'm going to get decent autophagy benefits over the course of 44 ish hours. My energy has been incredible this week, and I am thinking I might be able to start some resistance exercises soon (PEM is traumatic so I am not rushing it).

So, not saying I've found a cure, but not *not* saying it either. Crossing my fingers for continued health improvement.",1,1744383274.0,fasting,1,1.0,False
1jwrtgo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jwrtgo,MCM Nightstand - My First Design,"Last weekend I completed my first piece of furniture that I built without following any plans. Up to this point I have built the projects in the Weekend Woodworker course and I felt I had learned enough to create a piece without following anyone else’s plans.

I want to make some MCM pieces for my house (armoire, coffee table, entryway table, and credenza) so this felt like a good step to build to those projects.

This was my first time doing a panel glue up (which made me aware I needed more large clamps), half lap joints (for the legs), and building a mitered box.

I chose poplar for this project and stained it with a gel walnut stain.

I made one of the legs and the crossmembers from the scrap ends of the panel glue up which I quickly learned was a mistake because of the grain direction when ripped into the widths I needed for the cross members and one of the four legs. The cross members broke at the half lap joint so I needed to glue them back together.

I also wish I had added a small taper to the legs.

Something I forgot to consider was wood movement because everything ive built so far has been made of plywood.

Did I make a mistake screwing the cross members to the box? If so, what would have been a better way to make the attachment or is there a different design I should have used to attach the legs to the box?",6,1744383248.0,woodworking,2,1.0,False

Anyway. I’ve spent the last couple hours with bowls of coffee grounds on the counters, I’ve microwaved a bowl of vinegar, wiped the inside of the microwave with said warm vinegar, washed down the cabinets above the microwave (where the microwave vents out) with dawn dish soap, and washed the trash can lid where my daughter put the burnt plate.

“Can we actually make money using the free challenge?”

If you search through this group, you’ll see plenty of examples of those that have.

Just like this…

https://preview.redd.it/yu6t3js9t7ue1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=881fe2904c6fe2485ed52ff2d3bd528496defd5b

Ben’s not in ROYA

He’s not an experienced agency owner.

In fact, when I spoke to him last month, he’d just quit his 9-5 to force himself to go all in on AI.

Armed with just the free challenge, the book and the free bonuses…

He’s now got FOUR AI deals in play that are worth $25,000 to him.

Full disclosure… Two of those are still in the initial testing stages.

The other two are already paying Ben for the work he’s doing.

So what’s the difference between those who can take a [$14.40 book](https://honeysyed.com/aiagency) \+ free resources and get a result like Ben…

…and those who struggle to get a foot past the start line?

Well, I think it comes back to a quote from the great Jim Rohn:

“If you really want to do something you'll find a way. If you don't, you'll find an excuse.”

I’ve sat in front of super smart people, that have run businesses before, worked with clients and have a ton of resources behind them…

… that have struggled to book a single coffee date with a client.

And in the same breath, I’ve sat in front of people that are “greener than green”, with next to no resources and zero network…

…that have knocked it out of the park and landed client after client, using my free stuff alone.

Logically, that shouldn’t happen.

Given the exact same resources to work from, you’d think the person with more experience with clients and in business, would trump a newbie 100% of the time.

But, here’s why it doesn’t always work that way…

If the newbie knows what they want to do, believe they can get there AND will do what it takes to make it happen - they’ll get results.

If the experienced guy/gal knows what they want to do, but doubts they can actually get there…

They’ll find all the reasons why this WON’T WORK and then think there’s no point in trying - hence zero results.

This is the sneakiest form of self-sabotage.

It’s sneaky because we don’t even feel like we ruined “the thing” with our unwillingness to try because our brain told us we were never going to succeed in the first place.

So, when it comes to the question of “Can we actually make money using the free challenge?”

Yes, you can, and the easiest way to get started is:

**Step 1:**

Go through your phone or account package and pull together a list of all the business owners you know,

**Step 2:**

Send them this email/message:

Hi \[name\],

Long time no speak.

Do you have any old leads we can turn into sales using AI and SMS, on a performance basis?

**Step 3:**

When they reply, send this:

Great. Have you got 5 minutes free now to see a demo of how it works?

Do this first for some quick wins BEFORE you move on to cold outreach.

1jwrmxq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jwrmxq/glitching_out/,Glitching Out,"I feel like this is a fairly common experience with ADHDers but I'm curious how frequently others experience it. I honestly have at least one glitch out more days than not. They're particularly frequent in the morning.

For example, on days I work from home I have multiple items that I take out of and have to put back into the fridge, freezer and pantry - coffee grounds, oat milk, peanut butter, frozen fruit, etc. - while I'm making and cleaning up breakfast.

Sometimes I end up putting the wrong things back in the wrong places, but most mornings I end up glitching out for several seconds while trying to put stuff away. 

Like, I'll grab something off the counter to put away and suddenly my brain cannot figure out what item I'm holding or where it goes and I'll just sort of stand with my feet frozen to the ground while bouncing like a Sim. And it feels like I'm trying to move but I'm physically stuck?? 

And then as quickly as it hit me, it'll stop and I can move again. Whether or not I've actually figured out what I'm doing yet doesn't seem to be of great import. At this point I'll realize what just happened, shake my head really fast and then actively think through what I'm trying to do.

My partner has caught me glitching before and says I literally do look like a Sim when it happens lol Thankfully, he's a kind and supportive partner so his mild ribbing isn't hurtful and it actually feels nice to be able to laugh and make fun of myself for it. 

I'm very sensitive about my other executive dysfunction issues like poor memory and ADHD paralysis, so it's honestly kind of nice to have a symptom that's just a bit silly and easy to laugh about. Does that make sense?? 

Outside of my frequent morning glitches, other common ones are getting up to do something or being in the middle of doing something and suddenly forgetting what it was, or having two different things competing for my attention or two different directions I need to go and getting physically stuck in between.

After hearing so much about AI and writers being accused of using things such as ChatGPT to write, I decided to take a look and gave it a very short prompt just to see how it actually appeared.

Yep, I'm screwed, in all manners of the word. The way ChatGPT writes is almost identical to how I write. Short sentences, breaks - dashes. You may even be able to see just here how I've developed my style of writing.

I didn't give it any examples of my own writing. Just a small prompt, ""give me an example of this"" outside of my genre.

Hello everyone, I'm not sure if this is the sort of post that is allowed so apologies if so. Originally I was going to post in the print and play sub but that seems to get way less traffic, and this sub has led me to some fantastic games.

Anyway, I have recently treated myself by 'upgrading' some of my favourite solo print and play games, by supporting the creator as directly as I can by buying physical versions from The Game Crafter (I know), Button Shy or direct from the creator.

However, it seems a real shame to just throw these PnP versions out, especially since I spent so much time putting them together. I don't know anyone in my personal life that would be too interested, so I would like to donate them to anyone willing to pay postage (UK only). Either for personal use, or for communal use at an appropriate organisation. I know it's difficult to get hold of some of these games officially, especially in the UK, and printing is time consuming and costly in its own way, so this is my attempt to give back to the community in some way. The quality is very much homemade, so don't expect a professional finish, but I did my best!

Info on the specific games and how they are constructed:

**ROVE** \- one of my favourites. Inkjet Printed on paper, sleeved with a playing card between front and back. Includes instructions. PnP originally bought from PNParcarde.

**Paperbag Dungeons** \- one of the first I made and is not the best (in terms of crafting, the game is great). Printed onto red card (not great for low light tbh). Also an attempt was made at the box. Includes instructions. Excellent and unique game from Dustin Porta.

**Cairn** \- Printed as an A5 booklet (both sides). Includes a cardboard cover, saddle stapled (don't know what the correct term is, but the staples go through the spine/fold). I wanted the illustrated beastiary so just went and bought that and this from Lulu (as linked by creator).

**Isaludo** \- Printed as an A5 booklet (double-sided). Offered for free by Wil Su on boardgamegeek. [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2587399/isaludo-ten-new-solo-card-games-playable-with-a-st](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2587399/isaludo-ten-new-solo-card-games-playable-with-a-st)

1jwrhal,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1jwrhal/first_time_meds/,First Time Meds,"Hi all!! 

(I scoured this forum for this question/similar posts but I couldn’t find the feedback for my experience!)

I just got officially diagnosed with ADHD and I’m turning 30 in a couple months — it’s been wildly validating and honestly, kind of emotional. Like, so many things from my life suddenly make sense. I was always the “overly sensitive, anxious, sensory sensitive” human.

Anyway, I just started meds for the first time and I have some questions about how I’m responding to them, because… it’s weird?

My current med setup:
	•	10mg Adderall XR (extended release) in the morning
	•	5mg Adderall IR (immediate release) to take after ~8 hours if needed
	•	I’m also on 60mg Cymbalta for anxiety/depression, which has actually been great for me overall

Here’s what’s going on:
	•	When I take the XR in the morning, I feel incredibly groggy. Like, I literally wanted to nap the entire first day.
	•	I haven’t been drinking caffeine to give my body a chance to adjust (coming off 3–4 cups of coffee a day), so maybe that’s part of it?
	•	That said, one good thing is that my brain isn’t doing its usual 5,000-streams-of-consciousness thing — it feels like there’s finally just one steady stream. Super helpful.
	•	BUT… when I took the 5mg IR at around 4pm yesterday (had one more therapy session for the day), I was suddenly so sleepy — like falling-asleep-sitting-up kind of tired.

Other things I’ve noticed:
	•	Some body tingling / kind of buzzy feeling, like I’m an engine that’s ready to rev
	•	Still super tired though?? Like my brain is calmer but my body’s like… in shutdown mode?

So my questions for you all:
	1.	Did anyone else feel groggy or super tired when first starting Adderall?
	2.	Could Cymbalta be interacting in some weird way and making the grogginess worse?
	3.	Did you adjust eventually? How long did it take for the grogginess to fade (if it did)?
	4.	Did caffeine help/hurt when you were first starting out on stimulants?
	5.	Is the engine/buzz/tingling feeling just… part of it?
	6.	How did you know if a med or dosage was the right fit for you?

I know everyone reacts differently, but I’d love to hear your experiences. This has been such an eye-opening process and I’m just trying to get a handle on what’s “normal” vs what might need tweaking. Thank you all and this forum has been life changing and so validating!!!

1jwrgmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1jwrgmr/an_insight_into_helicobacter_pylori_and/,An insight into helicobacter pylori and intestinal metaplasia,"I have been thinking about the cause of metaplasia for a year. I actually knew that the issue was ""junk-like"" eating, and that’s why I decided to completely change my diet. However, banning everything upset my psychology. Since I also know that stress is harmful to the body, I felt stuck. For a year, I read hundreds of articles, and I think I am starting to understand the reasons behind everything. I am not a doctor; what I am going to write is based on the results of scientific articles.

You may have heard about the relationship between stomach cancer and Helicobacter pylori. Yes, this relationship is correct, but while many people have Helicobacter pylori, why do not all of them test positive or experience the same damage from the bacteria?

I first noticed the answer to this in a documentary I watched, which talked about intestinal bacteria, but I thought the same logic applies to H. pylori.

In the past, the human body used to get 50 grams of fiber, but now it can barely digest even 30 grams of fiber. For our digestive system to function regularly, we need to nourish our microbiome, and we should do this with fiber-rich foods. However, our bodies, which now struggle to digest 30 grams of fiber, begin to experience indigestion and bloating even when they receive 25 grams of fiber. Most people give up on eating fibrous foods upon seeing these symptoms. However, getting the body accustomed to fiber should be a process that spreads over 6 to 9 months, and the amount should gradually increase. Instead of experiencing this process, we try to change our diet all at once and eat fiber, we encounter problems, and we stop. This time, bacteria in our body struggle to find something to feed on. Helicobacter pylori is one of them. When it cannot find food, it starts to eat the stomach wall, initiating a process of inflammation.

Let’s set the fiber topic aside for now. We have reached the most important point. Please type ""Helicobacter pylori and salt consumption"" into a search engine. Consuming salt (especially dried smoked meat, pickled foods, canned goods) causes the proliferation and strengthening of Helicobacter. Salt also has the ability to irritate the stomach wall, which we will revisit at the end.

We consumed salty foods, and Helicobacter became stronger while we didn’t take in the fiber to feed it. Now, that area is its territory. As it can’t find food, it will start to attack the stomach wall, and this will lead to inflammation, i.e., the formation of gastritis. If this becomes chronic, it will turn into atrophic inflammation (loss of glandular properties). Cells that are constantly exposed to inflammation and attack will have to transform into resistant cells, known as intestinal metaplasia.

Why does the body have to undergo atrophy and metaplasia? Because it faces an invader it struggles to fight off. Why doesn’t every person experience the same thing? Because if a person eats a vitamin-rich diet, it prevents the process of metaplasia and allows for the reversal of metaplasia.

Now, I want you to search “articles on the relationship between intestinal metaplasia and vitamin C” on a search engine, and I also want you to do the same search for B12, folic acid, vitamin A, and vitamin E. You will get similar results in all cases. Vitamins are essential for cell renewal. When Helicobacter pylori colonizes, it eliminates iron and B12.

Let’s return to the topic of Helicobacter pylori. A study compared Helicobacter pylori positive and negative individuals and found a significant difference in vitamin C intake between the two groups. So, vitamins are important.

Let’s talk about stomach cancer in general, not just bacteria-related gastric cancer. I read an article about the relationship between coffee consumption and stomach cancer. I noticed that the places with the highest cancer rates in Europe are areas with a dense Slavic culture. I would expect it to be France, where people are fed with high saturated fat cheeses and butter (I love you, French people), but it wasn’t. Instead, the results appeared to be higher in countries with high consumption of pickled vegetables and salt.

Or let’s look at the rates around the world. Mongolia, China, Japan, Korea. In societies where salt consumption reaches up to 16 grams per day, stomach cancer is significantly higher than normal (salt consumption should normally be 5 grams). It is clear that salt is the enemy of the stomach. It’s not only involved in strengthening Helicobacter pylori but is also one of the causes of intestinal metaplasia. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28341758/)

If you search “vegetable consumption by country,” Asian countries will come up at the top. This seems a bit confusing, but if you delve deeper into the research, you will see that the vegetable consumption in those regions consists primarily of pickled vegetables. Yes, vegetables and fruits have high vitamins and fiber, but because these societies mostly consume them as pickles rather than fresh, they experience more harm than benefit.

In summary:

It’s very likely to catch the bacteria because we live in a society, and this bacteria spreads easily. To avoid it, we should wash our hands before meals and avoid eating anything that hasn’t been heated to 90 degrees outside. If we have caught it, we pay attention to fiber intake and salt consumption to prevent colonization. We are the owners of that environment; it has coexisted with us since humanity first emerged, but we don’t leave the environment to it. We pay attention to our vitamin intake. The Mediterranean diet is protective for the stomach, yes, but not everyone can do this. Even if you can’t, please pay attention to salt, fiber, and vitamin consumption.

Some medications also harm the stomach; everyone knows those medications. I’ll mention a lesser-known one: iron supplements. Yes, it has been proven that iron tablets can harm the stomach. However, liquid iron supplements do not cause the same damage.

Finally, humanity has been living with Helicobacter pylori for a long time. This bacterium was discovered 40 years ago, but it has been with us for much longer than that, to my knowledge. While research continues, there are also studies suggesting that this bacterium can be beneficial. I’m not saying this to praise the bad guy, but the idea that the bacterium protects against reflux and esophageal cancer is being researched. Perhaps the important thing is simply to maintain balance. It should be there without colonizing and protect us. We should also eat and live as we should. That should be the balance between us.

Thank you for reading; I used a translation program because I don't have sufficient proficiency in English. I apologize for any mistakes in my language.

I’m attaching an article about foods that counteract Helicobacter pylori below.

My name is Odette (23F) and my wedding to my amazing fiancé Benjamin (24M) is set in just a few months! Benjamin and I met at Harvard, when I was freshman and he was sophomore. He was like my Logan Huntsberger, caring, handsome, but also incredibly reckless and adventurous. He proposed to me at my graduation party, and I immediately said yes. There's a few things you should know about us, though.

We both live in a town not unlike Hartford (sorry, making a lot of Gilmore Girls references), where the expectation is to go to Harvard, Princeton or Yale, then get married and have one, maybe two children. The male is expected to work in Insurance, at his father's company, and the female can either be a housewife, or have a successful job in a career such as journalism, performing arts, or some kind of not completely stable career, so you still have time for parties with the women's club. We both have no problem following this - infact I am extremely grateful that I don't have to work if I don't want to, and I know that many people don't have that choice.

Our families know each other well, but we only really got to know each other at Harvard. His sister Danielle is like my own sister, and I can't be more excited to be her sister in law. My future mother in law, though, well she is very controlling over us.

She has told me countless times that now we are merging families and fulfilling our duties, we cannot ruin our reputation, which is why I am writing this post. You see, I'm best friends with our resident Lorelai (Gilmore Girls reference again, sorry!), also known as Kacey. Kacey now runs a small but successful bakery, where I go to have cups of coffee with some of the younger members of the women's club who actually like Kacey.

The elder members, for example, my mother in law, think of Kacey as a failure, and someone who will ruin our reputation, which is why she demands I cut ties with her. I've spoken to my mother, my future sister in law and Benjamin about this, but I don't know what to do. MIL tells me that I must ""fulfill family duties"" but can I do that if it means saying goodbye to my best friend?

I decided no, and I told MIL this, and she went livid. She told me she no longer gives her blessing, and that I have no sense of respect, and that I should go to hell. My future FIL is siding with me though, so I didn't think her threats were real. I thought they were empty, nothing to worry about. But that's when I got a call that the flower arrangements were going to be cancelled, and that my paperwork was trying to be changed in someone else's name. It was when I looked at the suggested changes that I saw that it had been changed by my MIL to make the venue, the wedding, everything for my cousin in law, Serina, who has hated me since day one. Her wedding was supposed to be next year, but MIL was trying to get into the paperwork and change it to our name.

I want nothing to do with that sick woman, but I want to marry my soul mate. Even if Serina and MIL try and ruin it all for me.

I, myself, don't have a lot of friends. We used to have a large group of friends, then one night, I went to a party without my husband and I was attacked at said party. We no longer hang out with those friends. My husband worries a lot about my safety now and does not like me going places alone. I have two friends from college who I still talk to now and again but we've grown apart and I don't like hanging out with them. I am trying to make new friends but it's slow going.

That said, I need a break. Badly. I expect my husband does, too, but our ideas of a break are very different. He wants to be with me, away from the kids, doing a lot of fun activities. I want peace and quiet, rest, and to commune with nature. 

What I really want is to rent a cabin in the woods by myself for a weekend. I want to go swimming, make a campfire, watch the stars, have coffee by the lake, lay in the sun, sleep, and read books. 

It's not that I need a break from him specifically, he's my best friend. I just need a break from \*everything\*. If he went with me, he would be bored and he would want to chat the whole time or go do things. 

I don't think my husband is worried that I would be stepping out on him or anything, I think he is just worried about my safety. He wants me to bring a friend but I don't have any friends I could have a peaceful, relaxing weekend with. For what it's worth, I grew up hiking, hunting, camping, and fishing.

I used to live in Dryden and Ithaca for 15 years, and worked in Ithaca for all of those years. I used to live right behind Cascadilla Creek, and found a way to walk basically anywhere in the city within 20 minutes. Since leaving, I’ve traveled across the world, often partaking in walking food tours when possible. I thought it would be fun to create an unofficial one for Ithaca, for future visitors to try one of the best things about Ithaca – the food!

I am writing this from a perspective of doing a food tour with 4 people – you may need to adjust depending on the size of your group, or just try on different days! Also, these are merely my recommendations, if you feel strongly that you want something different, go for it!

Bear in mind, I am trying to write this from the perspective of if you did a walking food tour, so some great places may have been left out, simply on the basis of location. Also bear in mind, I’m not really focused on the “tour’ part as much as the food part – I really have no idea what spots would be a point of interest in the downtown area – almost all the cool spots are the various waterfalls and gorges, which are a healthy walk away from the Commons or further.

1. Starting Point: Ithaca Ale House 301 E State St Suite 1, Ithaca, NY 14850. What to get: Crispy Spring Rolls (Buffalo Chicken Spring Rolls) -$14 ($3.50/person)Optional: Any of the fine beers on tap – but I recommend Waschussen Blueberry.
2. Viva Taqueria - 215 E State St, Ithaca, NY 14850. What to get: Any variety of single taco, 1 per person. - $18 ($4.50/person)Optional: Ithaca Root Beer or Ithaca Ginger Beer
3. Lou’s Street Food - 171 E State St, Ithaca, NY 14850. What to Get: 1 Hoffman’s Hot Dog per person, red or white, with toppings (I recommend white with sauerkraut and mustard). - $12.00 ($3/person).
4. Tibetan Momo Bar - 171 E State St, Ithaca, NY 14850. What to get: 10-piece Steamed Dumpling (various meats or veggie, I recommend pork) - $10 ($2.50/person)
5. Collegetown Bagels - 301 E State St, Ithaca, NY 14850. What to get: 2 Mexican Bagels, split in half - $14 ($3.50/person) Optional: Various coffee beverages.

Total: $68 ($17/person, excluding options items).  Other notable eats that you should try:

1. Pizza Aroma (Pollo Guisado)
2. Purity Ice Cream (2-Scoop cone with Banana and Sea Salt Caramel)
3. Ithaca Beer Company (Root Beer Float)
4. Gimme Coffee
5. Sal's Pizza
6. Shortstop Deli (Meatball Sub)

1jwr6kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1jwr6kc/does_anyone_ever_feel_like_the_nfh_after_so_many/,Does anyone ever feel like the NFH after so many complaints to the landlord?,"I’ve got a long one, but it gets WACKY, so hopefully you guys will get a few laughs out of it. 

- at first the apartment above me was pretty stompy and blasting East Indian music. I could honestly tolerate that. (I love heavy metal music and I’m a pretty laid back guy) stuff like that is normal apartment living. Whatever.
- sooner or later the slamming doors and stomping slowly became physically running back and forth in their own apartment with boots on and doing circuits in the stairwell next to my place at 6AM waiting for their ride to work. The music started to bleed into the late night around 11pm-2AM at some point as well. 
- at a certain point a few months in it was getting a bit “over the top” for me, so one morning I went out into the stairwell with my pajamas and toothbrush hanging out of my mouth since I was woken up anyways. He was shocked, but completely ignored me as he was pacing up and down the stairwell in those workboots until I asked him why he was being so loud, which he replied “it’s the girl I live with, not me” (???). So I just rolled my eyes and went back inside.
- I started recording and sending a lot of this to the land lord. She talked to him but nothing really stopped.
- fast forward a month more of this and one day I hear someone come down from that apartment (it’s not hard to miss as they slam their front door which shakes my kitchen shelves) and whoever it was started playing with my apartment door immediately, which was locked. I stood at the door and they must’ve been standing there for five minutes as they jiggled the lock and handle until they went back up. 
- I texted the landlord and already felt guilty as I had made noise complaints about them before, she said she would “talk to them” again. It’s a big reach and a bad excuse on their behalf but I thought maybe a friend of theirs got lost in the apartment or forgot which door was theirs or something.
- the next day it happened again, but this time I had put scratch and sniff piggy stickers on my door from the dollar store lolol. There was no mistake something shitty was going on, so I slammed the door with my fist as they were messing with the lock and I straight up told the landlord someone was purposefully trying to get into my apartment from upstairs this time 
- another guy was living with them, and when she “kicked him out” he threatened her physically in the parking lot as he stormed away.
- they’re still living above me and meanwhile they bought a TV which literally sits on the floor at full volume. Last night at 2AM I got to hear four episodes of family guy with them sitting on the floor clattering utensils on the hardwood, laughing hard
- usually I go up, knock on their door, they turn it off for 30 minutes, turn it back on, I go up, knock- repeat four or five times until they understand. At one point he ended up giving me his phone number to text him if I had complaints instead of going to the landlord (to his benefit) 
- always lies to me anyways despite this. None of us wake up until 8”: text message sent at 6AM.. or “we were in bed by 11” as I’m completely exhausted holding onto my first coffee for dear life because of the Punjabi bass I was assaulted with until 3AM
- on my way out one day I run into him in the parking lot and ask how family guy was last night in which he replies “oh, what is family guy? Is that some kind of tv show?” I roll my eyes. Ignore him as he feigns ignorance once again. 
- later that day he comes to my door and tells me anything I might hear is his wife or “the other girl in the spare bedroom”, despite me literally hearing him above my head. I say “I do not care who is doing it. Just stop it.” Starting to get angry at this point for the abrasive gaslighting. Getting harder to control my temper because of how polite I’ve tried being over years of this. I also have no idea how many people come and go or live up there now.
- meanwhile the whole time I stop texting the landlord with my complaints (about 12) because it’s a lot, I’m starting to feel like a bad tenant and she hasn’t replied to the last complaint I had. I realize there’s nothing she will do. At one point she said “I will not be renewing their lease”, but nothing ever happened yet.
- one morning on a rainy day I wake up and go to our SUV, parked in a stall beside their new vehicle which I guess had some sort of traditional new car ceremony with a Hindu swastika painted on the hood. But ours was caught in the celebratory crossfire with wet sticky rice thrown all over our windshield. No words. 😂😂
- the angriest I think I ever was in the last few months was the time they were blasting their TV at night so loud that i stuck my electric guitar amp to the roof and played raining blood at FULL volume with as many whammy bar squeals as I could do. It was LOUD. After the solo I took the amp down and they were literally still enamoured with their television. No reaction. Nothing changed. Zero realization. Just chuckles at Peter griffin sitting on the floor where my amp was literally blasting beneath them. I’m lucky I don’t have anyone living beneath me or across from me, as I would’ve gotten in a lot of shit.
- at that point I realized there was just no winning and  I was stuck with genuine baby brained idiots until they left or died. I honestly just can’t be mad anymore, at this point I am just a clown in the circus hahaha

I’m still here. Maybe I’ll give updates at some point. Hopefully this was at least entertaining to some of you.

1jwr49c,https://i.redd.it/ljno0weet7ue1.jpeg,The only three you need,"I decided to completely simplify my collection, and these are the only three I need: Hawas Ice, Lattafa the Kingdom, and Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa. They are all extremely mass appealing, easy reaches, and never miss. I give them all 9/10s. I will note that I, obviously, tend to enjoy sweeter fragrances.
All boast a longevity of 10+ hours and good to great performance, although in my experience Qahwa become a skin scent within 2-3 hours, whereas the Kingdom and Hawas project for 3-4. Hawas has monster projection for the first two hours, and will choke out people around you if you aren’t careful.

Qahwa covers the colder months, making you smell like a delicious, gourmand pie covered in coffee. It is my favorite scent out of the three.

The Kingdom is the most versatile because of its more aromatic and lighter nature when compared to the LME. It can be used any time of year (other than super hot days), and will have you smelling like a sweet vanilla, lavender, and a little bit of herbal spice at the top.

Hawas Ice is my least used fragrance so far because even in April the sun refuses to come out, but I love this scent profile. It is fruity and light, with a touch of mint on the top that rounds out the fragrance so well. This is the best performer of the three, filling my room with just two sprays. And its wayyyy cheaper than it used to be (I got it for $23).

If you want a simple collection around $75 that will last all year, imo you can’t go wrong with these three. Happy sniffing :)

Please DM if we have some things in common and you are looking for the same things. Looking for ladies 25+ years. No minors 

I’m looking for an F penpal to get to know and maybe make a genuine friendship. I’m also open to voice calls or meet ups if we live close by, once we get to know each other well after some time ofcourse). I’m from Texas so Howdy :)

My interests-

Coffee enthusiast- Its never not coffee o clock , Films - I’ve watched tons of movies of all genres. Currently want to check out more foreign films. Movie buddies?,
Horror- Love me some horror films and podcasts, 
History- Talk/teach me about anything History im always interested and love to learn more, 
Anime- I am getting into anime. Started with studio ghibi and wanting to check out 80s/90s films and series, 
Games- I am getting into casual cozy gaming. I am new to gaming world ,

Lately I’ve been interested in simple living and practicing gratitude. I like to appreciate the little things in life and find humor in the bad times. I sometimes deal with depression so if you are the same, maybe we can support each other and make each other’s day. 🌸

Messaging frequency- Some days I am super busy at work so I might not get to you as fast. I will typically reply a couple times a day. But some days only in evening. I’m looking for more of a penpal rather than texting buddy (if that makes sense) like quality, maybe lower quantity, longer messages  more than short/ high quantity.

Thanks for reading my really long essay! - E :))))

1jwr38w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1jwr38w/ashes_of_the_sun/,Ashes of the Sun,"# Ashes of the Sun

We lived about halfway between Huntsville and Nashville.  
A quiet patch of land tucked into the rolling foothills of the Appalachians, just north of the Alabama line.  
We were far enough from the city to see stars at night, but close enough to feel its hum.  
Ellie always said it was perfect: the kind of place where the crickets outnumber the people and Sunday morning still smells like biscuits and pine sap.

Before the war, my days were filled with routine. Commutes to Redstone Arsenal. Deadlines. Dinners.  
I worked with satellite systems—small pieces of a big machine no one understood completely.  
I told Ellie the job was boring. She always said I was lying.

We raised our kids in a valley not far from Pulaski, Tennessee.  
There was a creek that cut through the land, a sliver of silver in the morning light.  
Summers were humid enough to make your bones sweat, and the fall colors would spill down the mountains like spilled paint—gold, rust, fire-orange.

Sarah and Jacob loved that creek.  
Every spring, the frogs would come. Hundreds of them. Tiny, green, and loud as hell.  
They'd wade in barefoot, chasing minnows, building dams out of stones and fallen branches.  
It was paradise. Ours.

When the sirens wailed, we were eating dinner.  
Chicken and dumplings. Cornbread. Sweet tea in mason jars.  
It should’ve been a normal night.

But Huntsville—Rocket City—was always more than it looked.  
NASA. Defense contractors. Missile research.  
We’d joked about it once: “If things ever go bad, we’ll be the first ones lit up like a Christmas tree.”

We weren’t wrong.  
But we were lucky.

Our basement wasn’t anything special.  
Concrete slab, cinder block walls, old carpet, and that faint smell of mildew, no matter how many dehumidifiers I ran.  
But it saved us.

The blast came late—somewhere around midnight.  
Far enough that we didn’t see the light directly, but close enough that the pressure wave rolled over the hills like thunder, knocking pictures from the walls and cracking the windows upstairs.

Ellie clutched the kids, and I just sat by the radio, trying to catch anything but static.  
Somewhere out there, the world was dying.  
And we were alive.

We didn’t emerge for three days.  
By then, the wind had shifted.

Huntsville was gone. Not just damaged—*gone*.  
Nashville, too.  
Satellite photos—before the signals died—showed rings of fire, spreading like oil on water.

Everything south of us was blackened.  
The ash started falling by the fifth day.

It came slowly at first, like dust from a gravel road. Then heavier. Constant.  
It clung to everything. Got in our lungs, our food, our dreams.

We rationed. We filtered rainwater through old coffee filters, boiled it, and prayed.  
I told the kids it was a game. Like camping, but longer.  
But the air burned your throat, and the birds stopped singing.

Sarah was first.  
Her laugh used to echo off the hills like wind chimes. She’d sing made-up songs to the squirrels and scold the creek for being “too cold.”

But then came the cough.  
Then the fever.  
Then the silence.

We buried her at the base of a red oak on the ridge. The same one she used to climb when she wanted to see “the whole world.”

I carved her name into the bark with my pocketknife.  
It felt small.  
Not enough.

Jacob didn’t cry when he died.  
He was always the quiet one.  
He just stared at the sky, eyes squinting like he was trying to see past the ash.

He asked me if the stars were still there.

I told him they were.  
I lied again.

Ellie held on longer, but her spirit was already fractured.  
She talked to Sarah in her sleep. She sat in the empty bedrooms with old toys in her lap.  
One day, she didn’t come in for breakfast.

Her heart, I think. Or maybe just a quiet surrender.

I didn’t bury her.  
I laid her on the old porch swing, wrapped in quilts, and sat beside her until the sun went down.  
I held her hand like I used to, when we were young and invincible.

The stars never came out.

Now it's just me and the hills.

The ash covers everything.  
The creek stopped flowing. Turned thick. Gray.  
The trees are skeletal—just limbs and shadows.

The roads are cracked.  
No cars.  
No voices.

Just wind and ruin.

I write these words from the cellar.  
This notebook is all I have left.  
No one will read it.  
But I write anyway.

Because someone should say their names.

Sarah. Jacob. Ellie.  
They were here.  
They mattered.

They loved and laughed and danced barefoot in the rain.  
They caught fireflies.  
They made me promise we’d go to the beach next summer.

They believed there would be a next summer.

The radiation is in everything now.  
The food.  
The soil.  
Me.

I don’t eat much anymore.  
I drink when I can melt the ash into water.  
It tastes like pennies and regret.

I sleep with a blanket over my face, not because it helps, but because the illusion of safety still soothes something in me.

I don’t have much time.  
My teeth are loose.  
My skin peels like bark.  
Sometimes I forget where I am.

But I remember them.

This valley was once beautiful.  
The foothills cradled us like old hands.  
Now, they’re tombstones.

I’ve left this notebook in the root cellar, wrapped in a freezer bag, sealed in a Tupperware tub.  
It won’t last long. Nothing does anymore.

But if some distant mind—machine or man ever uncovers this place…

Know that there was life here.  
Real life.  
Messy and beautiful.

And know that when it ended, it didn’t end with rage or fire.  
It ended quietly.

A whisper in the leaves.  
A final breath.  
And a father, alone, beneath a sky that no longer cared.",1,1744381353.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

I have heard stories about Ascaso having quality issues, with some even going as far as to say the internals are not built well. 

I mainly drink milk based drinks, hence the need for a dual boiler/thermoblock, and most probably won't be pulling many consecutive shots at a time (just 2 for my wife and I). I also dont drink coffee at a set time (eg morning), whenever I feel like it, which is why I value fast heat up as well so I can just turn it on and pull a shot without waiting for long.

I am slightly leaning towards the SPX, but please feel free to share your opinions on both machines.",1,1744381256.0,espresso,9,1.0,False

In the White family home sat a beautiful and innocent-looking woman by the name of Jennifer Young.  
  
Dressed in an exquisite gown, Jennifer fiddled with a tea set on the coffee table. She grabbed a teacup and thrust it clumsily at the person seated opposite her. “H-Have some t-tea.”  
  
While she stuttered, saliva trickled out of the corner of her mouth.  
  
Yet perhaps the most eye-catching thing about her was the set of intersecting scars on her face.  
  
“He's having me marry a fool so that he can express his gratitude?” Mitchell White ignored the childish woman before him as he flipped through a report on Jennifer Young.  
  
Then, he tossed the report aside while his mood turned sour.  
  
His expression hardened further as he recalled her IQ results. *IQ = 50.*  
  
Mitchell could not deny that her looks were utterly incomparable. Still, the sight of her trickling saliva was a turn-off.  
  
The butler, James Ward, explained, “Old Mr. White said that Ms. Jennifer saved his life. So—” However, he trailed off mid-sentence.  
  
A month earlier, Mitchell's grandfather, Montgomery, had gone missing in the mountains during an ancestral pilgrimage",1,1744381246.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1jwr1ez,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorontoHangoutFriends/comments/1jwr1ez/would_anyone_be_up_for_a_onetime_platonic_friend/,"Would Anyone Be Up for a One-Time, Platonic Friend Date?","This is my (29F) first time ever posting on Reddit. I know that dating apps exist, but I feel like I have a specific inquiry that doesn't really meet the niche of a dating app—to go on a platonic “date” with a guy—just for fun, no strings, no flirting, no expectations beyond having a nice time.

I found out after 5 years of marriage that I was/am being cheated on. I have only ever been with the husband and an ex (long term rel’p and this person also cheated on me lol) so I have no experience of actually going on dates with people. I also got married young so I literally don’t have any clue what dating is like, nor do I have any interest in starting a new romantic or sexual relationship. I am still working through healing through the infidelity, working on myself, and I also have kids involved in the marriage so there’s a lot of factors for why I don’t want to commit to anything.

I want to be super clear:
1.	This is strictly platonic—no sex, no flirting, no expectations of anything romantic or physical.
2.	It’s a one-time thing. If we vibe and want to be friends after, cool—but no pressure either way.
3.	I’ll pay for myself. This isn’t a “real” date in the traditional sense. Just two people grabbing coffee, food, a walk, etc., and chatting like humans.

I have wonderful friends and a great support system and I’m getting professional therapy, so this isn’t about unloading emotional baggage. I wouldn’t talk about my situation or my children on the platonic date. I think getting myself out there in a pseudo-dating environment would really help me get over him and show me that the world didn’t end by doing something harmless like getting out, talking to someone new and having fun.

I was told that nobody would actually do this, but I’m shooting my shot here and wondering if anybody actually would be willing to hang out for a couple of hours with a stranger knowing that there’s no interest on my end to pursue a further more serious relationship?? I guess you would be doing charity work to help a millennial girl get over heartbreak in the most rom-com way possible (minus the romance)? No pressure, no follow-up, just a few hours of being human together. 

If you’re genuinely chill, open-minded, and respectful with the boundaries above, feel free to reach out.

I’m also free to hang for an hour tonight around the Sheppard-Yonge area at 10pm.",8,1744381220.0,TorontoHangoutFriends,9,0.83,False
