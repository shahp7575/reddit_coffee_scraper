1ppli7i,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ppli7i/fn_the_wandering_elf/,[FN] The Wandering Elf,"Smile. Smile—that is what my existence speaks. Every lip that curves into a faint smile excites me, only to become my sudden paralysis.

That’s what I thought as my fingers wrapped around the present I had been asked to deliver. I adjusted my grip and headed to the machine to place it inside. Ginger was leaning against it, a coffee in his hand.

“Frost… you seem down. You’ve been gloomy lately,” he said.

I let out a soft chuckle. “Just the load, Ginger. It’s that time of year to make smiles—at least, that’s what Santa tells us.”

I pulled the machine’s tray out and laid the present on it carefully. “There.”

He tapped my back as he headed out, pressing his cup into my hand. “Here—drink this and walk with me.”

“Where are we going, Ginger?” I asked as he kept walking.

“Catch a deer.”

I hurried to catch up, nearly dropping the cup in my hand. “What do you need me for?”

He opened the door and glanced back at me. “An extra hand wouldn’t hurt, would it, Frost?”

We stepped outside, the snow pelting us like raindrops.

“Frost… remember the time we caught our first deer with Santa, in weather like this?”

My cheeks glistened as I looked upward. “Those were pretty neat times.”

I lingered in the moment, letting my eyes close, before Ginger nudged me.

""Alright, enough nostalgia. Drop that cup—we’ve got people to make smile,” he said as we climbed onto a nearby wagon.

He pulled a pair of binoculars from his satchel and handed them to me. “Let’s see if Santa’s little elf can spot a deer.”

I took them and raised them to my eyes. “Very funny, Ginger.”

He urged the horses forward, and I glanced back at him. “Hey… Ginger, can I ask you something?”

He looked at me, brow lifting. “Yes, Frost?”

I let out a slow breath. “I-is making people smile… all we do?”

He gave me a confused look. “Is that all we do? What kind of question is this, Frost?”

I leaned back, my palm brushing my face. “I-I mean… aren’t you ti—”

He shouted, “Deer! Turn the binoculars that way!”

I turned the binoculars to where he pointed. “I see it. Get me a little closer.”

We approached, and I climbed onto the wagon’s wooden side. “How do I even catch this thing, Ginger?”

“Take this.” He handed me a lasso. “Now hurry—catch it.”

“All right, geez.” I readied the rope. “Come here!” I threw the lasso toward the deer—and caught it. “I got it!”

Then—the deer dragged me off the wagon. “Ah! Ginger!” I landed flat on my face, the deer still hogtied.

Ginger hurried over, hand resting on his knee, laughing as he held his belly. “Pretty tough, huh?”

I couldn’t help but laugh too as I dusted myself off and led the deer. “Next time, you’re the one catching this thing.”

“Been a while since I’ve seen you laugh like that,” he said, pointing toward a river. “Come on, let’s go have a drink there before we head back to the factory.”

We walked to it, sitting by the riverside, and he handed me a drink, ""your favorite."" I took it from him and opened it.

Leaning back against the sand, he asked, “So… what did you want to tell me?”

I placed my drink on the sand and stared upward. “It’s just… I don’t know, Ginger. Can’t we do anything else besides make others smile?”

“Like another role?” he asked as I nodded. Letting out a smile, he looked at me. “You’re a pretty odd elf, you know that? I’ve never really thought about that.”

He reached into his satchel. “Well, you’re in luck—I wanted to give you this since you’ve been looking so gloomy.”

My gaze followed him as he placed a map beside me. “A map?” I asked, lifting myself. “Where does this lead?”

“The big guy—Santa,” he said, gesturing broadly. “Maybe you could ask him for a new role. Who knows?”

I couldn’t gather my words before he hurried forward and hugged me. “Don’t worry—I’ll cover for you at the factory. I just want you to be happy again.”

His hands felt so warm before he stood and led the deer away. “You better hurry, Frost, before Santa goes to deliver those presents.”

He waved goodbye as I got to my feet and grabbed the map. “Thank you!” I called out, tears glistening on my cheeks.

I studied the map. “The first place is pretty close.” Then I looked ahead, hand resting on my head. “That should do it.”

I hurried toward the shed beyond, my feet dragging snow in my wake.

When I reached it, my feet sore from the cold, I knocked on the door. “H-hello?” No answer. I whispered, “Anyone here?”

I glanced at the map. This should be it.

Before I could knock, the door opened, and an old lady appeared.

“S-sorry, this map led me to you,” I stammered.

She just smiled and stepped aside. “Come in. You should get some rest—your feet look sore.”

I held the map close to my chest. “It’s alright. Just tell me what you need.”

She insisted, “Come in. At dawn, I’ll tell you everything.”

I stepped into the house, slipping off my shoes and placing them neatly in a corner. “Thank you.”

I sank back against a nearby mattress. “Ah…”

“Feels good, huh?” she asked, smiling as she handed me a cup of coffee.

I took the cup from her and sipped. “So… what do you want me to do?”

She handed me a blanket and tucked me in. “I’ll tell you when it’s dawn.”

I had more questions, but my eyes grew heavy. “W-w…” My words trailed off as sleep claimed me.

The night settled around the shed. I could hear raindrops tapping outside, while inside it felt warm and quiet.

Dawn came, and I woke, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Sitting up, I noticed a pair of fresh clothes laid neatly beside the bed.

I changed into them and slipped on my shoes, my feet finally feeling warm.

The door creaked open, and the old lady motioned for me to step outside. “Come—help me catch this herd of chickens.”

I followed her out, watching the flock scatter around the yard.

“Help me with this,” she said calmly, “and I’ll give you what you need.”

“Thank you… for the clothes,” I murmured as I stepped down, my gaze fixed on a chicken darting nearby.

I lunged for it. “Got you!”—but it darted away, and my face ended up buried in a pile of mud.

I spent the entire afternoon chasing chickens, my hands smeared with dirt and chicken droppings, until I finally caught every last one of them.

After gathering them all, I locked the cage. She approached, a gem glinting in her hand, a smile on her face. “Here—this is for your help, elf.”

I looked at her, taking the gem as I stepped forward. “It’s alright… just doing my job.”

She stopped me and handed me a boiled egg. “Keep this in your satchel. It’ll help with the snow golem.”

I tucked it into my satchel and waved goodbye to her. *Pretty nice lady*.

Studying my map and the terrain ahead, I muttered, “Next stop… and last stop—the inner North Pole.” I shook my head. “Pretty far, better get going.”

I traveled through the harsh terrain, making stops along the way to clean up and enjoy some hearty meals.

Finally… I reached it: the inner North Pole.

There it was—Santa’s home, all red and green, with a massive snow golem standing guard. I edged closer, my gaze fixed on the towering figure.

“What does an elf want with Santa?” it bellowed. I kept my distance, raising my hands. “I-I have questions.”

The golem leaned in. “Got any goodies?”

I stumbled back, fumbling for my satchel, and pulled out the boiled egg the old lady had given me. “H-here,” I stammered.

The golem snatched the egg from my fingers and swallowed it whole, then boomed, “You may pass.” I stepped closer to Santa’s door.

I twisted the handle and opened it. Inside, Santa sat in a chair, biscuit crumbs on his beard and a glass of milk in his hand.

“An elf? Frost?” Santa said, setting the glass of milk down. “C-come in.”

I stepped inside and sank onto the couch beside him.

He handed me a glass of milk, his beard as white as ever. “It’s been a while, Frost. What brings you here?”

I finally voiced the question that had been racing in my mind. “Santa… can I change my role?”

He looked at me, slightly puzzled, then nodded. “Alright… what do you want?”

I froze. “What do I want? I—I don’t know.”

Santa chuckled. “So you came all this way without even knowing what you want, Frost?”

He rose and walked toward the door. “Well, come along, Frost. Let’s go deliver some presents. You didn’t come all this way to do nothing, did you?”

I got to my feet and followed him, the door creaking as I shut it behind me. “I missed you, Santa,” I said as I climbed onto the sleigh.

“Me too, Frost,” he replied softly. “Our roles kept us apart, didn’t they?”

We flew across towns as he handed me presents, and I tossed them out, watching the children’s smiles light up each street.

“Frost,” he called. I turned toward him. “Yes, Santa?”

“I don’t even know why I have this role,” he said, “but seeing their faces so bright… it makes even the cold feel tender. Don’t you agree?”

I gazed over the sleigh, a smile spreading across my face. “Yes, Santa. The cold… it really does feel tender.”",1,1766045435.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

1pplh9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1pplh9q/bangalore_traders_coffee_meetup_on_5th_january/,Bangalore Traders - Coffee Meetup on 5th January,"WHEN & WHERE:
Date: 5th January 2025
Time: 9:30 AM onwards
Venue: Buddies Cafe, Koramangala
Address: 4th Floor, 614, 80 Feet Road, next to Glen Bake House, 6th Block, Koramangala, Bangalore 560095
Fee: Rs. 399 (includes coffee)

So I've been trading for about two years now, mostly alone, staring at screens all day. Made some money, lost more than I'd like to admit. The worst part? Nobody around me gets it.
That's why I'm putting together this meetup.
Look, I'm not some guru. I don't have a magic strategy. But I've learned that trading alone messes with your head. You make emotional decisions, chase losses, have nobody to call you out when you're being stupid.

Here's what I want to talk about:
Why we all make the same emotional mistakes when trading solo
How having other traders around actually helps with discipline
Real conversations about losses (because let's be honest, we all have them)
Psychology, risk management, and staying consistent
Learning from each other's screw-ups, not some telegram signal

Who's this for?
If you're new and overwhelmed, come. If you've been losing money and don't know why, come. If you're doing okay but feel stuck, come. Basically, if you trade Indian markets (stocks, F&O, whatever on NSE/BSE) and want to be around people who get it, you should probably come.
We're NOT doing forex or crypto. Just Indian market stuff.

This isn't going to be some seminar where someone lectures you. No tips, no signals, no courses to sell. Just traders sitting down, having real conversations, maybe learning something useful.
I'm keeping it small so it actually feels like a community, not an auditorium.
If this sounds like something you need, drop a comment or DM me.

1pplg3k,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1pplg3k/after_so_many_toxic_relationships_you_finally/,"after so many toxic relationships you finally find a nice sweet person, but my gut feeling is back ? Nb-24 & NB-25","Hello, this is in regards to me (NB25) and my partner (NB24) I wanted to ask about how everyone felt about my current situation. I tried looking up similar post but ofc nobody has my exact situation so im choosing to share. 
I've made the poor decision of having dated multiple people who were either physically, sexually, or mentally abusive. Like literally almost everyone ive dated (you look for home in the places that broke u cause it's familiar) story of my life. But after so many poor relationships I finally found a partner that goes above and beyond for me (I think?) and has never been sexually or physically abusive. We are now going onto a year and 3 months of dating, about to move to oregon together ... and I don't know if it's because im kind of scared of committing to moving in with someone im dating and maybe trying to find a problem but lately I have this horrible gut feeling that ive had before in relationships. When we first met up until now their attitude in the way they speak to me has always been a topic of discussion. Its mean. Like raising voice (never calling me names) but very irritated, mean. I have told them before I don't appreciate that and will not accept it. I visited their parents and could see this is how their mom talks to them, so for a while I think I let it slide. A week ago we went grocery shopping and there was no need to be annoyed, except they're pressuring me to decide what I want and we can just go. Mind you whenever I plan grocery shopping and they're the passenger it's very chill, because I'm super chill. Anyways, we leave and they ask where I want to go for coffee. Its a shop right across the grocery store, and I point at it. We're driving there and they yell ""where is it"" and I didnt say anything because I was immediately upset and would not support that attitude. So then they yell again ""where is it!"" And I was so triggered from bad past relationships I screamed back ""do not talk to me like that"" after I said we should just go home. The ride back was silent from us both.for the first time, I ended up saying I needed time to myself and I took myself to get coffee and food. When I got back later we didnt talk about it but we both were kind of trying to just make the energy calm. After a nap they asked me to kiss them and I did, but they started saying I don't love them and didnt kiss them how they wanted. I HATED screaming at them, it made me feel exactly like arguing with my exs trying stand my ground and demand being treated nice, this being a really giving and kind relationship ive been working on communicating. I told them right after I didnt appreciate their lack of consideration. I was upset and triggered this morning and now im the bad guy because you expect me to baby you. They seemed to understand, they teared up a bit, and they apologized.
I will cook good real food for the both of us, and anytime I don't cook we lowkey are both just hungry. Or they offer to cook chicken sausage, just that. If they're feeling fancy it's either with rice or squash. But it's such a plain meal I don't even want it😭 they've said they want to take care of me and love me because of how much I care for them, that ""they don't even realize they're hungry until I ask if they've ate, and they say they aren't hungry and it's been a while since their last meal, I cook something really good to feed them anyways"" like omg what about me LOL, im not in the mood all the time either and do not want sausage ... 
ugh anyways moving on, Today I wanted to hangout with my fri3nd and sleep over, especially because im moving out of state. I also moved an hour away from them all to live with my gf so I also am lucky if I see them once a month. When I brought up wanting to sleep over I fear I recognized a pattern I had ignored. Two months after moving i took an unexpected sleep over trip to go see all my friends without my partner, and that night my gf was so upset and texting me that they needed space from me to think? I felt so guilty I drove home at 6 am. Everytime ive visited after that, they've came with me (they have 1 friend and my friends and my gf do enjoy having eachother around). Yesterday I took them with me as well. I was hanging out with everyone and my gf and said multiple times how sad it was making me hanging with everyone having a good time because I move at the end of this month. I've been friends with them all for like 3 years. But my same friends messaged me tonight to sleep over again, my gf has work early so I said only id be going. And my gf starts saying I don't love them bc im leaving them, and I hate them. To go on my gfs day off so they can come. Being very short and just giving me these eyes that they're clearly bothered. I get fomo but after me saying how sad i was, it just felt like common sense to hear i wanted to go and say ""okay, have a good time babe"". I have dealt with toxic behavior for so long I didnt even give any attention to it after, but I did say I don't hate you and you can come next time. They ended up not trying to make any conversation and just fell asleep. My friends ended up canceling but I have the feeling that I know if I ended up going they would've been mad at me. Or been weird and had some sort of animosity, idk. Again, I knowwww what toxic relationships are like and I have such a bad gut feeling that this could grow into that or something. I don't even know if im paranoid either. Like those can't be the worst things in the world but I clearly feel some way and need insight on what anyone else may think.

But I'm a relatively talkative person, I yap a lot about my interests, and my interests have been pretty much the same ones for 10 years. All I talk about are books, movies, coffee, TV shows. My room says a lot about me. Posters and decors. But apparently, they're having a hard time getting gifts for me! I don't know why it's so hard! I pride myself a good gift giver. I used to make handmade gifts, I have a page in my journal dedicated to my friends' likes and interests as a guide for gift giving. 

I appreciate small things. Even just a cute and thoughtful keychain is getting treasured or displayed! So I don't understand why it's so hard for people to give gifts. I understand that not everyone has the time or inclination for gift giving and I don't expect them to put the same effort as I do! But then again it feels so lonely and that they don't really know Me at all...

He comes close and whispers, “Please, you gotta help me. These people think all I need is prep time, but I’m so out of my league here.”","“Ah, now there’s a sight for my beautiful eyes. Stand Tall, in the flesh. What an honor. To think you would come and greet me in person. I must have made an impression.” Jack All laughed, dusting off a pink shoulder pad stitched into his yellow-and-pink suit. While the suit made him look like a bee that had been covered in small clumps of pink gum, Jack All found the look too unique to pass up.

In contrast, Stand Tall wore a simple business suit. Not even a nice suit. One whose tie was carelessly tucked into his coffee-stained white dress shirt. Jack All at least expected the hero to have a jacket to go with the suit, and surprisingly he didn’t. Without a jacket, the shirt left his hairy lanky arms dangling from his loose sleeves, giving him less the look of a man wearing a suit, and more the look of a baboon who had stolen a suit during a day of hijinks.

“What? Got nothing to say to a former villain? You can’t hurt me. I’m a good guy now. I’ve changed. I did therapy and yoga with Blizzard. That means I’m a good guy now.” He sang out, trying to act calm and collected even while his knees wobbled, not expecting the hero to stay so silent. “You heard me… didn’t you?”

There was a small grunt from Stand Tall, whose footsteps didn’t slow. Now, the entire room of heroes was watching them. No one daring to utter a single word, worried this would be the death of their newest recruit. Soon Jack All’s right knee shot upwards, trying to shield his body. “S…stay back.”

Jack All had heard all the stories about Stand Tall — how the hero had never lost a fight and had crushed even the strongest of villains. That’s what made him such an icon. He never seemed to do anything special, yet all the villains around him simply gave up or died. It reminded him of a character he once saw in a show about a bald hero named after a city or town somewhere. That character bluffed his way through the ranks, thanks to his incredible luck and the help of the main character.

But, Stand Tall was no bluffer. He was the real deal. A man Jack All thankfully had never encountered during his days as a villain. Soon the hero’s powerful hand was holding Jack All’s pink shoulder pad, pulling the former villain close. While Stand Tall hadn’t used much force in his pull, the villain instinctively leant forward. In the same way a person would rather go with a rip tide than swim against it. He just felt in his heart that moving with him was the safest option.

“Jack All.” He uttered in a voice so tired and worn that it sounded like it was creeping out the decayed throat of a haunted corpse.

“Yeep. Yees. Yespers.” He said, merging the two answers together.

Stand Tall lowered his body, his bloodshot eyes meeting Jack All’s gaze. Jack All remained frozen stiff, seeing the frail white hairs atop the hero’s head, and the five-o’clock shadow that decorated his flat chin. “I need your help. These people are fucking insane. I’m meant to be working admin. I used to answer the emails here. I’m not cut out to be a hero.”

“Huh?” Jack All blinked, tilting his head, expecting to see the other heroes smiling as they revealed this was all a prank. Yet, they still looked terrified, as if they all believed Stand Tall would genuinely rip Jack All’s head off.

“They think I’m a genius. I’m not… I just got lucky once. I saw something in my emails about how a Level 5 villain was on the verge of death after battling Spartan Rage. Only problem was, Spartan Rage had been knocked out during the battle, leaving the villain on their last legs. So, I thought. Now’s my chance to become a hero. I could deliver the kill shot and take all the credit! Long story short, I drove over to where the battle was, kicked the villain in the head, and some stupid reporter snapped a photo. Then, bam! I became the greatest hero alive. You have to help me!” Stand Tall shook the villain, who found himself questioning their story.

“What? Why did you keep being a hero then after you defeated Death’s Call? Why did you keep lying about your strength?” He said before squinting his eyes. “If you're even telling the truth.”

“The money was too good. I was getting $16 an hour here when I was doing admin. As a top hero, I got $100 an hour. Can you imagine how hard it is to turn down $100 an hour? Plus, most top heroes just sit around until there’s a major threat. How many major threats are there a year?”

“Three.” Jack All answered, knowing the estimated rate of major threats by heart. Major threats were a villain’s equivalent of a holiday, since all the other heroes were occupied with the threat, giving them a chance to loot and do whatever they pleased. “See. I thought I would just retire before the next threat happened. Then. Well… I accidentally killed the next villain.” He said, not exactly proud of his victory.

“The next one? Marvila Demonia? HOW DOES ONE-MMMPTH.” Jack All tried to speak, only for Stand Talls hand to cover his lips.

“Not so loud.” When Stand Tall removed his hand, Jack All spoke.

“How does one accidentally defeat someone as strong as her?”

“I hit her with my car. It was an accident, I swear. I was watching a really funny meme while driving and -- Oh, do you know what memes are?” He said with an earnestness that made Jack All feel like he was either talking to a toddler or a boomer.

“Yes… I know what memes are.”

“Ok. So, there’s this monster. And its driving after a beer. Then it’s like. Hey that bump is shaped like a… oh, what’s the word?”

“I get the reference. Please stop trying to explain it. So, you accidentally ran over a woman who, mind you, was part demon, and that killed her? What type of car are you driving?” Jack All asked in utter disbelief that he was even having this conversation. He couldn’t believe he was even entertaining this madness, yet for some reason, he couldn’t bring himself not to believe the man.

“A 2006 Toyota Corolla.”

“Unbelievable. An icon of the villain world, killed by a Toyota Corolla. Ok. Let’s say I believe what you’re telling me. What do you expect me to do here?” Jack All whispered, surprised no one had come to help him yet.

“You need to pretend you stole my powers. You can steal powers, can’t you?”

“If I touch someone, I can freeze their powers for around five minutes. It’s not a permanent thing, and I wouldn’t consider it stealing. Sealing, perhaps? But not stealing.” He explained.

“We’ll say it’s a new version of your abilities then. That you’ve evolved them.” He said hopefully. “Touch me wherever you want. I’m ready.” He released his grip on Jack All before spreading his arms.

“Oooh. Look, he’s telling Jack All to hit him. He’s probably putting that former villain in his place.” A person watching whispered to their colleague.

“I’m not touching you. I’m pretty sure that’s an HR violation. While I would love to be the guy that pulled the curtains on Stand Tall, I’m also not a villain anymore. I’ll be killed if I do that to you.” Jack All argued.

“Isn’t being evil more fun? Do it. Being evil is cool.”

“What are you? My friend telling me to jump over a river on my bike? Stop trying to peer pressure me.”

“Hm… I thought you were cool.” He said with a shrug of his shoulders. That almost made the villain act out, and that annoyed Jack All. The villain, unable to believe a childish taunt had him seething.

“Enough. Think think.” Jack All tapped his head before getting an idea. “If we are going to do this. We will do it my way. Got it?”

“Sure.”

The next week, there was a threat worthy of the legendary hero. So, Stand Tall rushed onto the scene fifty minutes after the battle started, followed by Jack All. Standing beside the already defeated villain was the bloodied hero Jumpstart. The hero, barely able to stand, was being held up by a reporter. When Stand Tall arrived, the crowd of people all turned and clapped in an act that reminded Jack All of those hero movies he had reluctantly watched when he was a teenager. All it needed was some dramatic music and panning cameras, and it would have been nearly identical. Well, perhaps not nearly identical since most movie heroes didn’t show up after the battle.

Jumpstart pushed the reporter away, trying to stand tall for his favorite hero. “Stand Tall. It’s an honor, sir. I did my best to take down the threat.” He said, giving Stand Tall a salute. Somehow, Jumpstart had willed himself into standing on his own two feet, even with his left leg being twisted in the opposite direction.

“You did better than your best. I would say you did super duper best.” He stated, earning a cheer from the crowd.

“Super duper best? That’s the best you could come up with? You had a whole car trip to think of something.” Jack All muttered before gasping, remembering his line. “DID THAT HORRIBLE UGLY CREATURE TWITCH?” He squealed, always loving a chance to be dramatic.

Everyone turned, seeing the defeated horned ghoul twitch. Its pale limbs brushed against the ground, having some strange dream while it was knocked out. That twitch was enough to set their plan into motion. “Good eye, my super duper sidekick.”

“FUCKING SIDEKICK? I NEVER- whatever.” He said, continuing the script. “Oh no, it’s going to blow up the city with its self-destruct ability. Whatever will we do? I could use my new ability, but that would only delay the inevitable. If only I had a strong power source I could use to dull the ghouls’ powers. If I stole the powers of a powerful hero, I could use that to seal the explosion.” He said, really wishing he had put more thought into his explanation.

“I see. There comes a day when every hero must make a sacrifice. Today. I will do that.” Stand Tall crouched before the ghoul, touching its wrinkly head.

“Wait, let me do it. Please,” Jumpstart said, his goggles filled with tears. “I’m sorry. I should have been more careful.”

“No. You did good, Jumpstart. I’m glad this city has someone like you. You can take my place. NOW DO IT.”

“Bzzz. Wooosh.” Jack All tapped the hero’s back, adding some special effect noises with his lips, in the hopes it gave his fake ability some credibility. After a minute, he pulled his hand away. “It’s done.”

“My powers. I can feel them fading. This marks the end of Stand Tall. Now I ask you all to Stand Tall for me.” He said, crossing his arms before the camera, while Jack All sighed, heading back to the car, needing a lift home.

A week passed, and things had changed drastically. Stand Tall was back at his office job, except this time he had a hero’s salary instead of the average desk workers one. Unfortunately for Jack All, he was suspended from his hero duties for a year, since some people blamed him for what had happened to Stand Tall, even if he had only been following the heroes’ orders. So, for his safety, they gave him a desk job, promising him he could return to the field when everything had blown over. Which meant he now sat at a desk beside the former hero.

Jack All typed up an email, only to feel a set of eyes peering at him. He sighed and pushed his keyboard away. “What?” He asked, looking at the grinning Stand Tall, whose suit was now in pristine condition, no longer that messy thing he had worn through all his battles.

“Check your emails.” Stand Tall snickered.

“Why?”

“Just check.”

Jack All dragged his current email into the draft pile before opening Stand Tall’s email. The subject reading. ‘FOUND THAT DEER VIDOE. REALLY FUNNY. MUST WATCH.’ Jack All had a few questions about that email. The first being, was the doe part a pun or was he just bad at typing? Second, why did he type like a YouTuber trying to hype up a lame video? “You’re giving me half your salary this year, aren’t you?” Stand Tall asked, that being the only thing keeping him from pulling his keyboard out and bashing the annoying former hero with it.

“Yeah. That seems fair since they aren’t paying you a hero’s salary.”

“Fine, I’ll watch it during my break, even if I’ve already seen it.” He said, returning to his other email.",2,1766044682.0,Sadnesslaughs,0,1.0,False

A submariner and an oyster perpetual. Nothing outrageous. Just simple starter pieces that are nicer than the basic pieces that he was wearing beforehand. But with that said, he’s always been very interested in watches and I know he loves reading about them. He wants to slowly collect them over time. 

As we are grown and in our forties now, gift giving isn’t so easy. We’ve also always been the type to just buy for ourselves the things we like.  And our relationship has been less about the material things for that very reason. But I periodically want to find a nice, thoughtful gift to give him. I just don’t know enough about watches to know if such a coffee table book exists. I was hoping to find some suggestions/guidance here by other watch enthusiasts. 

Any suggestion is better than the blank slate I have on my mind right now! hahahaa

1pplahd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pplahd,my ex friends filed a false claim about me to cps,"I needed to get this off my chest here bc i can’t exactly do it anywhere else without adding more fuel to the fire, so here is a story time about my ex friends trying to get my son taken from me for all the wrong reasons.

I (24f) had been friends with this girl, we’ll call her Katie (20f) and her boyfriend, we’ll call him Joshua (19m) for almost two years. For context, since last year continuing into this year, they have given me plenty of things as gifts. And in my state, ND, a gift completed over a month ago is yours to keep and cannot be revoked. 

Katie and Joshua made new friends and immediately dropped me and my boyfriend, who, we’ll call Charles (28m) the next day after making said friends. Right at this time, I became super close with this girl my age, who we will call Aria. We instantly became best friends because, well, we just clicked and she helped me through getting dropped by my ex friends, and she made me feel better. 

Now, I like to make relatable TikToks because, I mean, who doesn’t? But as relatable as my TikToks are, they’re never directly about anyone unless I’m making a post about Charles, Aria, or my son (4m) I’ll call him Jacob for this post. On Sunday night into Monday morning, Katie and Joshua were stalking my TikTok profile on Katie’s burner account (if you don’t know yet what that means, basically just an account specifically made to stalk people) and, of course, I get a call shortly after.

Joshua immediately starts going off saying I’m “talking shit” and that my post were about Katie, when in reality I just made TikToks because I had makeup on and was dressed cute. They also brought up how it was “fucked up” that I already made a new best friend, even though they dropped me once making new friends. I explained it wasn’t about them and that Aria basically picked me up when they knocked me down, but they seemed dead set on it being about them anyways and said “if you wanna start shit we can start shit.” They never brought up Jacob, but I knew that’s what they meant, because they’ve threatened to call cps on me once before for setting boundaries on how they speak to me and treat me (i am a people pleaser and honestly i wish i would’ve grown a backbone sooner and just walked tf away, but lesson learned i guess). 

I responded back, simply trying to explain myself. He blocked me so I sent it to Katie, as you can see in the photos, that conversation went about as well as you’d expect. They wanted their black table that they left at our apartment back, and I put it outside. They then proceeded to ask for basically everything they gifted me, such as my couch, coffee table, and perfumes. I explained the ND law I explained earlier, and even sent a screenshot and explained its been well over a month since receiving the gifts, as they were gifted to me around the beginning of the year. 

Now, I have ring camera footage, but of course I cannot put that here without their real names being exposed so if I figure out a way around that, I’ll re-add it later. They just lingered outside my apartment for like 20 almost 30 minutes, insisting they would “bang on my door” if i didn’t give them what they wanted. Charles was asleep because it was midnight crossing into 1 am, and I told them I was going to wake him up if they didn’t leave. I also said i’d call the cops (which I should’ve honestly just done from the start) and their response to that was “just give us our shit back and this shit will all be over.” They still hadn’t left, so I warned that I woke Charles up, still wouldn’t leave. I said if they didn’t leave Charles would make them leave (not like in a physical fight kind of way, more like a “hey get off my property you can’t be here” kind of way). They said if he touched them they’d call the cops, I proceeded to say he wouldn’t. 

(I should probably note i was listening to what they’d say on the ring camera and answer whatever they said through text, i didn’t wanna go out there and have something worse happen. So if the texts seem weird, that is why). Finally, they gave up and left, but before leaving they said “we’ll come back with Katie’s mom, and we can bring more people if that’s how you wanna play it.” Shortly after leaving, Joshua called me, saying “We’ll just keep showing up until you give us our shit back.” And at this point, I lost it. I screamed at the top of my lungs repeatedly saying “if you come back here i’m calling the fucking cops!” as he kept trying to talk over me, and eventually went silent because I wouldn’t stop yelling these words. He then called me a “fucking bitch” and hung up on me. I blocked both of them and anyone I thought would message me on their behalf. (My landlord/boss also gave me the okay to call the cops if they ever come back again).

Fast forward to today, I’m picking Jacob up from headstart, and his teacher tells me “So it appears someone made a claim about you to cps, someone showed up today asking questions. I insisted he is clean and happy and healthy, they might give you a call.” Instantly I knew who had done it, because two days after this incident could not be a coincidence. So i go home and deep clean my apartment (it honestly wasn’t even that bad but panic set in at this point). I met with a social worker at 3, and she let me know what the allegations were, and that’s when my suspicions of them making the claims were confirmed. The allegations they claimed were:

- “She doesn’t bathe him or change his dirty pull-ups” (he literally tells me when he needs a change or has to go potty, and I bathe him every other night).
- “Her and Charles lock him in his room all day and night and don’t pay any attention to him” (Jacob always has my attention and I never once have locked him in his room nor would I ever).
- “She just yells at him all the time” (this one I found soo fucking ironic because Joshua used to yell at Jacob for just standing up to give me a hug or ask for water or juice and say “Sit the f*ck down! Why don’t you fucking listen?!” And i’d always snap back at Joshua for saying that.)
-“She buys 🥃 for minors” (They’d always ask and I’d always say no).
-“Her and Charles drink all day and get 🥴 to the point they can’t take care of him” (I barely drink as it is, and when I do Jacob is fast asleep. Even then, I can still function, I don’t get 🥴).
- “Charles drinks and 🚘 with Jacob in the car” (He doesn’t drive if he’s been drinking, and he especially wouldn’t if we’re with him).
- “They don’t have a carseat for him” (I actually just got a brand stinkin new one for him)
- “He still sits in a high chair” (A month ago I got him his own little table to sit at for mealtime, and they knew about this by the way).

In ND, i was fairly certain making false claims is illegal, but turns out that’s a gray area. The social worker informed me I could try but they wouldn’t be able to do much as it’s a gray area and it’s only been proven once here. She saw how panicked I was that I might get Jacob taken, so she let me know “I’m not going to take him from you, so don’t think about that. If that were the case, it would’ve happened already.” And she let me know this case would most likely be dismissed because they wouldn’t find anything, although she doesn’t make the final decisions but she’s fairly certain that’s the route this will go. 

I won’t find out anything else until the new year in January due to the holidays and her going on vacation. I find it so unfair that Joshua and Katie get to do this to me and my family with ZERO repercussions and just get to get away with it. I pray Karma finds them and bites them in the ass, because unfortunately, there’s not much I could do without getting in legal trouble and getting assault charges on my name (as much as I’d love to whoop their ass for bringing my son into this, I need to be here for him). If there’s any update, I’ll update this post. Until then, that’s my story time, and hopefully they get their come-uppens. ",1,1766044584.0,RantAndVentPH,1,1.0,False

1ppl9jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreMeetups/comments/1ppl9jk/bangalore_traders_coffee_meetup_on_5th_january/,Bangalore Traders - Coffee Meetup on 5th January,"WHEN & WHERE:
Date: 5th January 2025
Time: 9:30 AM onwards
Venue: Buddies Cafe, Koramangala
Address: 4th Floor, 614, 80 Feet Road, next to Glen Bake House, 6th Block, Koramangala, Bangalore 560095
Fee: Rs. 399 (includes coffee)


So I've been trading for about two years now, mostly alone, staring at screens all day. Made some money, lost more than I'd like to admit. The worst part? Nobody around me gets it.
That's why I'm putting together this meetup.
Look, I'm not some guru. I don't have a magic strategy. But I've learned that trading alone messes with your head. You make emotional decisions, chase losses, have nobody to call you out when you're being stupid.

Here's what I want to talk about:
Why we all make the same emotional mistakes when trading solo
How having other traders around actually helps with discipline
Real conversations about losses (because let's be honest, we all have them)
Psychology, risk management, and staying consistent
Learning from each other's screw-ups, not some telegram signal

Who's this for?
If you're new and overwhelmed, come. If you've been losing money and don't know why, come. If you're doing okay but feel stuck, come. Basically, if you trade Indian markets (stocks, F&O, whatever on NSE/BSE) and want to be around people who get it, you should probably come.
We're NOT doing forex or crypto. Just Indian market stuff.

This isn't going to be some seminar where someone lectures you. No tips, no signals, no courses to sell. Just traders sitting down, having real conversations, maybe learning something useful.
I'm keeping it small so it actually feels like a community, not an auditorium.
If this sounds like something you need, drop a comment or DM me.

1ppl8qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1ppl8qt/hypothetically_how_would_you_use_ternary_and/,"Hypothetically, how would you use ternary and quaternary units on otherwise normal chips?","Let's assume that magically,  small units using ternary and quaternary logic existed, and the microcode running them was decently advanced, maybe like coffee lake strength compared to nova lake.

There would be 6x 81 trit wide registers, with 81 the full width, then 27, 9, and 3. 

There would be 8x 256 quat/quad units, with 256 the full width, then  64, 16, and 4. 

The weird number of registers is to decrease register pressure.

Given the astronomical differences in potential values between binary, trinary, and quaternary, imagine an instruction set that would allow for easy interoperability. For example, trit/quad registers can magically overflow into binary GPRs/SIMDs, `movqq rax/rcx/rdx/rsi/rdi/rbp/r11/r12, 4rax` `vmovdqqa ymm0, ymm1, ymm2, ymm3, 4rax` or go in the other direction (binary -> ternary or quaternary). If you have other instruction ideas, it would be neat to see.

Imagine if they were 100% accurate, or if they were less than 100% accurate and things like temp or fluctuations in power could mess with them.

Also imagine if they could either be general purpose registers or SIMD registers.

My hand froze halfway to the door. Practice? Nerd. Was my long crush Tyler, the hockey star in the school talking about me?

""No way. You actually got the bookworm in bed?"" His friend full of disbelief and amusement.

""Bathroom, technically,"" Tyler corrected with a laugh that made my blood turn to ice. ""But yeah, mission accomplished.""

""And now I can use it to get to the queen bee Madison?""

“You have no idea how thirsty that little nerd is,” Tyler bragged, loud enough for the whole locker room to hear.

“I barely brushed my hand against her, and she was already shaking like she was about to beg me to keep going.”

He snorted. “If I just say her name? Bet she’d soak through her panties before she even realized it.”

The guys exploded with laughter.

My face went so hot I thought my skin might actually melt off.

“She’s that desperate, huh? So what about the queen bee? You heading over to show her how your little test subject performed?”

""Already texted her this morning,"" Tyler replied smugly. ""Told her I was finally ready to date someone on my level. ""

My legs nearly gave out. The hallway spun around me as his words hit like physical blows.

‘Practice. Someone on his level.’

\--

The bass thrummed through the walls of the Delta Phi house, vibrating against my ribs as I pressed myself closer to the bathroom door.

My heart hammered so hard I was sure Tyler, the hockey star in our school could feel it through my thin dress when he pulled me inside, his hockey-roughened hands sliding up my arms with an urgency that made my breath catch.

""God, Hailey,"" he whispered against my ear, his voice thick with something I'd never heard before. ""You have no idea how long I've wanted this.""

The words sent electric shocks through my system. Twenty years of friendship, of secret glances and hidden feelings, and now Tyler Matthews—’the’ Tyler Matthews—was pressing me against the marble countertop like I was something precious he couldn't bear to let go.

His mouth found mine, hungry and desperate, and I melted into him completely. Every rational thought scattered as his hands tangled in my hair, as he kissed me like he was drowning and I was air. The party outside might as well have been on another planet.

""Tyler,"" I breathed when he trailed kisses down my neck, and the sound of his name on my lips made him groan.

""Say it again,"" he demanded, his blue eyes dark with want as he lifted me onto the counter.

I couldn't think, couldn't breathe, could only feel the heat of his body against mine as he worshipped me with his mouth and hands.

When he dropped to his knees, looking up at me with that devastating smirk that had haunted my dreams since middle school, I thought I might actually die from the intensity.

“Hello,” Someone knocked the door. “Hello?”

“Someone’s coming.” My hand slid into his hair, trying to push him away. If anyone saw us like this, I would honestly die of embarrassment.

But Tyler only gripped my hips tighter. “Doesn’t that make it even hotter?”

His tongue dipped deeper between my folds, sending a shiver tearing through me.

“I want to taste you right here, right now,” he murmured against me, “even if we get caught any second.”

“And I don’t care. He\*l, I’d be proud.”

His low, sinful voice sent shivers straight through my core. When his tongue pushed deeper, exploring me with slow, devastating strokes, I almost screamed.

The sounds I made should have embarrassed me, but Tyler seemed to drink them in like they were music.

Even when footsteps echoed in the hallway outside, even when voices drifted past the door, he didn't stop. If anything, the danger made him more reckless, more desperate.

When he pulled me down from the counter and spun me around, I was already trembling from everything he'd done. But then he was inside me, and the world exploded into sensation so overwhelming I had to bite my lip to keep from crying out when someone knocked on the door.

“Hello?” There came the knock again.

""Occupied!"" Tyler called out, his voice strained, and I felt him smile against my shoulder as he moved deeper.

Afterward, as we tried to catch our breath, he picked up my underwear from where it had fallen. Instead of handing it to me, he brought the lace to his nose, inhaling deeply with that same smirk that made my knees weak.

""Tyler!"" I gasped, mortified and thrilled all at once.

""Souvenir,"" he said simply, tucking the fabric into his pocket like it was the most natural thing in the world.

I floated through the rest of the party in a daze, Tyler's arm around my waist like I belonged there. Like I'd always belonged there. When he walked me home, kissing me goodnight under the porch light, I fell asleep believing my entire world had finally clicked into place.

\--

The next morning, I practically skipped to campus. Everything looked different—brighter, more beautiful. Even the autumn leaves seemed to shimmer with possibility as I made my way to the athletic complex, hoping to catch Tyler after practice.

The locker room door was slightly ajar, and I could hear the familiar sounds of the team winding down from their morning skate. I was about to knock when Tyler's voice drifted out, clear and unmistakable.

""Dude, I'm telling you, it was perfect practice with that nerd.""

My hand froze halfway to the door. Practice? Nerd. Was he talking about me?

""No way, Matthews. You actually got the bookworm in bed?"" Jake Morrison's voice, full of disbelief and amusement.

""Bathroom, technically,"" Tyler corrected with a laugh that made my blood turn to ice. ""But yeah, mission accomplished.""

The world tilted sideways. I pressed myself against the wall, invisible and forgotten, as my perfect night crumbled into something ugly.

""So what was she like?"" Another voice—Danny James from the second line. ""I mean, we all know she's been panting after you since forever.""

""Exactly what you'd expect,"" Tyler said, and I could hear the smirk in his voice. ""Grateful. ‘Really’ grateful. Made all these cute little sounds when I—""

""Spare us the details, man,"" Jake interrupted, but he was laughing. ""So you're really going to use this to get to Madison?""

Madison, the queen bee of the school, who was also the team leader of the cheerleaders. So, she’s the one Tyler always wanted?!

“You have no idea how thirsty that little nerd is,” Tyler bragged, loud enough for the whole locker room to hear.

“I barely brushed my hand against her, and she was already shaking like she was about to beg me to keep going.”

He snorted. “He\*l, if I just say her name? Bet she’d soak through her panties before she even realized it.”

The guys exploded with laughter. My face went so hot I thought my skin might actually melt off. I wanted to vanish—crawl under a bench, disappear into a crack in the floor, anything.

“Damn,” Danny whistled, grinning like the jerk he was, “she’s that desperate, huh? So what about the queen bee? You heading over to show her how your little test subject performed?”

""Already texted her this morning,"" Tyler replied smugly. ""Told her I was finally ready to date someone on my level. She's meeting me for lunch.""

My legs nearly gave out. The hallway spun around me as his words hit like physical blows.

‘Practice. Someone on his level.’

""Genius move,"" Danny said admiringly. ""Get the desperate girl out of your system so you don't seem too eager with the queen bee.""

""That's the plan."" Tyler's voice was getting closer to the door. ""Madison Reed doesn't date guys who can't control themselves around women. But now I've got my urges handled, and I can focus on what really matters.""

""What if the bookworm gets clingy?"" Jake asked.

""She won't be a problem,"" Tyler said dismissively. ""Girls like Hailey know their place. She'll take whatever scraps I throw her way and be grateful for them.""

I stumbled backward, my vision blurring with unshed tears. Twenty years of friendship, of thinking I knew him, and this was what he really thought of me. ‘Scraps.’ ‘Practice.’

The locker room door swung open, and Tyler stepped out, his hair still damp from his post-practice shower. When he saw me standing there, frozen in the hallway, his face didn't show even a flicker of shame or surprise.

Instead, he smiled. That same devastating smile that had melted my defenses last night.

""Hey, Hails,"" he said casually, like he hadn't just shattered my heart into a million pieces. ""What brings you by?""

I stared at him, this stranger wearing my best friend's face, and felt something cold and final settle in my chest.

""Nothing,"" I whispered, backing away. ""Nothing at all.""

As I turned and ran, Tyler's laughter followed me down the hall.

\--

The morning sun feels like mockery against my skin as I walk across campus, my steps mechanical and hollow.

Every face I pass seems to know—their eyes lingering a second too long, whispers following in my wake like poison. The memory of Tyler's crude laughter echoes in my head, mixing with the phantom sensation of his hands on my body just two nights ago.

I clutch my physics textbook tighter, using it like armor against the stares. The same hands that traced my skin with such reverence now feel dirty, tainted by the knowledge of what he really thought of me.

'Just practicing on the bookworm.'

The words slice through me again, fresh as an open wound.

I'm so lost in my spiral of shame that I almost miss him—Tyler, leaning against the brick wall outside the science building like he owns it. His hockey jacket hangs perfectly on his broad shoulders, that same devastating smile playing on his lips that made me melt just days ago.

Now it makes me sick.

""Hey, Hails."" His voice carries that casual warmth that once made my heart race. ""Perfect timing.""

I freeze, my grip on my textbook turning white-knuckled. ""Tyler.""

He pushes off the wall with that fluid athlete grace, closing the distance between us like nothing has changed. Like he didn't just destroy me yesterday.

""I need a favor.""

The audacity steals my breath. ""A favor?""

""Yeah."" He reaches into his backpack, pulling out a thick packet of papers. ""Calculus assignment. Due tomorrow, and you know how these things go during hockey season.""

My stomach drops as he holds out the assignment, that same confident smirk on his face. The same expression he wore when he bragged about me to his teammates.

""You want me to do your homework?"" The words come out strangled.

""Come on, you're brilliant at this stuff."" His tone is so casual, so entitled, like I should be grateful for the opportunity.

""Besides, you owe me for the good time the other night.""

The world tilts. Heat floods my cheeks as his words hit me like a physical blow. He leans closer, his breath hot against my ear, and I catch that familiar scent of his cologne mixed with morning coffee.

""Don't act shy now,"" he whispers, his voice dropping to that intimate tone that once made me shiver with want. Now it makes my skin crawl.

""We both know how much you enjoyed it.""

I jerk back like he's burned me, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""Tyler, I—""

""Hailey!"" A sickeningly sweet voice cuts through the air. ""There you are!""

Madison Reed glides toward us like she's walking a runway, her glossy black hair catching the morning light. She's dressed in a fitted designer dress that probably costs more than my textbooks, her green eyes sparkling with malicious delight.

She slides her arm through Tyler's with practiced ease, pressing close to his side. ""I was just looking for you, babe.""

Babe. The word hits me like ice water.

Tyler's entire demeanor shifts, his attention snapping to Madison like she's the sun and he's been lost in darkness. The casual cruelty in his expression melts into something warm and adoring.

""Madison."" His voice carries a reverence that he never used with me. ""You look incredible.""

She preens under his attention, shooting me a triumphant glance. ""Thank you, darling. I always do.""

I stand there frozen, watching Tyler transform into someone completely different. Someone who looks at Madison like she hung the stars while I'm invisible beside them.

""So what were you two talking about?"" Madison's voice drips with false sweetness as her eyes narrow on me.

""Just asking Hailey to help with some coursework,"" Tyler says smoothly, not even glancing my way. ""You know how good she is with numbers.""

The dismissal in his tone cuts deep. I'm not a person to him—I'm a service. A tool to be used when convenient.

""How sweet,"" Madison coos, but her smile is razor-sharp. ""It's so nice when people know their place, don't you think?""

The insult lands perfectly, and I see the satisfaction in her eyes. Tyler doesn't defend me. Doesn't even seem to notice the cruelty in her words. He's too busy staring at her like she's a goddess.

""I should go,"" I manage, my voice barely above a whisper.

""Don't forget,"" Tyler calls after me, finally looking my way. He waves the calculus assignment in the air.

""Tomorrow morning. You're a lifesaver, Hails.""

The casual nickname that once made me flutter now feels like another slap. I turn away before they can see the tears burning in my eyes.

\--

By lunch, the whispers have grown into a roar.

I sit alone in the corner of the dining hall, picking at a sandwich I have no appetite for. The usual buzz of conversation seems different today—sharper, more pointed. Every laugh feels directed at me.

""Isn't that the girl who—""

""I heard Tyler Matthews—""

""So desperate, honestly.""

The fragments of conversation drift over like poison, each one making me shrink further into myself. I keep my eyes fixed on my untouched food, trying to disappear.

""Well, well. Look what we have here.""

I look up to find Madison standing over my table, flanked by her usual entourage—three perfectly dressed girls who hang on her every word like disciples. Their smiles are predatory.

""Eating alone again, Hailey?"" Madison's voice carries across the dining hall, drawing attention. ""How sad.""

""I'm fine,"" I mumble, not trusting my voice to stay steady.

""Are you though?"" One of her followers, a blonde named Brittany, tilts her head with mock concern. ""You look a little... disheveled.""

""Maybe she's still recovering from her weekend activities,"" another girl adds with a giggle.

My cheeks burn as more heads turn our way. The dining hall seems to quiet, sensing drama.

""Now, now,"" Madison says, her voice dripping false sympathy. ""We shouldn't gossip. Though I have to say, throwing yourself at Tyler like that... it's rather embarrassing, don't you think?""

The words hit like physical blows. ""I didn't—""

""Oh honey,"" Madison cuts me off with a laugh that sounds like breaking glass. ""Everyone knows. The whole campus is talking about how desperate you were. Following him around like a lost puppy.""

""That's not what happened,"" I whisper, but my voice is lost in the growing crowd of onlookers.

""Isn't it?"" Brittany chimes in. ""Because from where I'm standing, it looks like you threw yourself at a guy who was clearly out of your league.""

The dining hall has gone completely silent now, all eyes on our table. I can feel the weight of their stares, the judgment in their expressions.

""I mean, really,"" Madison continues, her voice carrying to every corner of the room. ""Did you honestly think Tyler Matthews would want anything serious with... this?"" She gestures at me dismissively.

The cruelty in her tone makes me flinch. Around us, phones are coming out, probably recording every humiliating second.

""Oops!""

The exclamation comes from Brittany, but there's nothing accidental about the way her lunch tray tips forward, sending her salad and soup cascading over my head and shoulders.

The cold liquid hits me like a shock, soaking through my sweater and dripping down my face. Lettuce and croutons scatter across the table and floor around me.

The dining hall erupts.

Laughter. Cruel, delighted laughter that seems to come from every direction. Phones flash as people capture my humiliation, immortalizing this moment forever.

I sit there dripping, too stunned to move, as Madison and her friends dissolve into giggles.

""Oh my God, I'm so sorry!"" Brittany says, her voice high with fake concern. ""How clumsy of me!""

""Don't worry,"" Madison adds sweetly. ""I'm sure Tyler will still let you do his homework. That's all you're good for anyway, right?""

Through the crowd of laughing faces, I spot him. Tyler, sitting three tables away with his hockey teammates.

Our eyes meet across the chaos, and for a moment, I think—hope—that he'll stand up. That he'll defend me.

Instead, he looks away.

Worse than that, as Madison saunters over to his table, he pulls out the chair beside him. She settles in with a satisfied smile, and Tyler wraps his arm around her shoulders, pulling her close.

The message is crystal clear: I don't matter.

I stand on shaking legs, soup still dripping from my hair, and walk toward the exit. The laughter follows me every step of the way, echoing off the walls like a nightmare I can't wake up from.

\--

That night, I'm finally starting to feel human again after a long, scalding shower when I hear it.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

The sound comes from my window, soft but insistent. My blood turns to ice as I recognize the pattern—the same rhythm Tyler used when we were kids, sneaking into each other's rooms for late-night adventures.

I peek through the blinds and there he is, standing on the fire escape outside my second-floor window. His hair is mussed from the climb, and he's wearing that same cocky smile that once made my heart skip.

Now it makes me want to vomit.

He gestures for me to open the window, his expression expectant. Like he has every right to be here. Like today never happened.

I shake my head and step back, but he taps again, more insistently.

""Come on, Hails,"" he calls softly, his voice muffled by the glass. ""Open up.""

The audacity is breathtaking. After everything—the locker room bragging, the cruel dismissal, letting Madison humiliate me—he thinks he can just show up and I'll welcome him with open arms?

I grab the window lock and twist it firmly shut.

His confident expression falters. He taps again, harder this time.

""Hailey, don't be like this,"" he says, louder now. ""We had fun the other night. I thought maybe we could... practice some more.""

Practice. The word hits me like a physical blow, bringing back every cruel detail of his locker room confession.

I step closer to the window, close enough that he can see my face clearly in the lamplight. Close enough that there's no mistaking my expression when I mouth a single word:

""No.""

His face goes through a series of emotions—surprise, confusion, then anger.

""Seriously?"" he hisses, pressing his palm against the glass. ""After everything I've done for you? After I gave you the best night of your life?""

The entitlement in his voice makes my vision blur with rage. He actually believes he did me a favor. That I should be grateful for the privilege of being his practice dummy.

I raise my hand and slam it against the window, the sound sharp and final.

Tyler jerks back, his expression shifting to something ugly. ""Fine,"" he spits. ""Be a frigid bitch. There are plenty of girls who would kill for what I'm offering.""

""Then go find them,"" I whisper, knowing he can't hear me but needing to say the words anyway.

He stares at me for a long moment, his face twisted with wounded pride and anger. Then he turns and climbs down the fire escape, disappearing into the darkness.

I sink onto my bed, my whole body shaking with adrenaline and relief.

For the first time since that night in the bathroom, I feel like I can breathe.

But as I lie there in the darkness, one thought keeps echoing in my head: if Tyler thinks this is over, he's about to learn just how wrong he is.",1,1766044077.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

The dating landscape in 2025 has reached a critical inflection point. According to [Forbes Health's July 2025 survey](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-statistics/), **91% of men and 94% of women** report that dating feels harder than ever before. Meanwhile, [over 350 million people worldwide](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) are swiping, matching, and messaging on dating apps—creating unprecedented competition for attention and meaningful connections.

The traditional solution—hiring a dating coach—remains financially out of reach for most singles. Professional dating coaches charge [**$75-$300+ per hour**](https://www.sharethestruggle.org/blog/dating-coach-cost) for consultations, with comprehensive packages running [**$3,000-$15,000**](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/dating-coach-paid-right-man_n_65da592ce4b0e4346d528c13) for multi-month programs. For someone already spending the average [**$213 per month**](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-statistics/) on active dating, these costs are simply unsustainable.

# The 2025 Dating Crisis: Why Singles Need Strategic Support

The statistics paint a sobering picture of modern dating challenges.

# 📉 Dating App Burnout Has Reached Epidemic Levels

According to [Forbes Health's July 2025 survey](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-app-fatigue/), **78% of Gen Z report dating app burnout**—the highest rate of any age group. The [New School Free Press](https://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2025/12/12/why-is-gen-z-leaving-dating-apps/) reports that more than half of Gen Z feels burned out ""often"" or ""always"" while using dating apps.

The consequences are significant:

# 💰 Professional Dating Coaching Remains Prohibitively Expensive

The cost barrier for expert dating guidance is substantial. According to [Share the Struggle's 2025 analysis](https://www.sharethestruggle.org/blog/dating-coach-cost):

|Service Type|Cost Range|
|:-|:-|
|Per-session coaching|$75-$150|
|Premium coaching sessions|$150-$300+|
|Multi-month packages|$3,000-$5,000|
|Comprehensive programs|$10,000-$15,000|

For someone already spending **$213 per month** on active dating (with serious daters spending over **$300 monthly**), adding coaching costs is simply not feasible.

# 🎯 The Profile Optimization Mystery

Most users approach profile creation haphazardly—uploading whatever photos are convenient, writing generic bios, and wondering why matches don't materialize. Yet research reveals specific strategies that dramatically improve results:

[Research from UC Berkeley](https://newsroom.haas.berkeley.edu/research/research-reveals-the-key-to-an-irresistible-online-dating-profile/) reveals a counterintuitive truth: profiles emphasizing wanting to *know* the other person are significantly more attractive than those emphasizing wanting to *be known*.

# 💬 The Conversation Skills Gap

What works in person often fails spectacularly over text. According to [OkCupid's research](https://theblog.okcupid.com/exactly-what-to-say-in-a-first-message-2bf680806c72):

The challenge extends beyond opening messages. Most users struggle with conversation pacing, escalation timing, and recognizing when to move on from dead conversations.

# 🤖 AI Is Transforming Dating—But Not How You'd Expect

According to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/03/technology/ai-dating-apps.html), AI is fundamentally transforming the dating app industry. Major platforms like Hinge, Tinder, and Bumble are introducing AI-powered features for profile optimization and conversation prompts.

However, [Fortune reports](https://fortune.com/2025/07/17/dating-apps-ai-gen-z-bloomberg-study/) that Gen Z remains skeptical:

It remembers your past conversations, tracks your progress over time, and iterates your strategy based on actual results. The AI also stays current with 2025 dating trends and platform algorithm changes.

# Can the AI help with specific dating app conversations in real-time?

Yes. You can share conversation screenshots or describe specific situations, and [the AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) will provide message drafts, timing advice, and strategic guidance for that particular interaction. It can help with openers, mid-conversation escalation, handling flakes, post-date follow-up, and navigating difficult conversations.

# Does it work on mobile?

Yes. You can access [Free AI for Dating App Advisor](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) through the Jenova mobile app, making it easy to get real-time advice while you're actively using dating apps or even during dates when you need quick guidance. The mobile experience is optimized for quick consultations and message drafting.

# How honest is the feedback?

[The AI](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) provides direct, constructive feedback without sugarcoating. If your photos are unflattering, your bio has red flags, or your conversation approach is failing, it will tell you clearly and explain why—along with specific recommendations for improvement. This honest approach, combined with actionable guidance, is what drives real results.

# Can the AI help with multiple dating apps simultaneously?

Yes. [Free AI for Dating App Advisor](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) can provide platform-specific optimization for Tinder, Hinge, Bumble, and other dating apps, since each platform has different algorithms, user demographics, and best practices. It can also help you decide which platforms are best suited for your goals and target demographic.

# Why This Matters: Democratizing Expert Dating Guidance

The dating guidance gap has long favored those with financial resources. While **91% of singles** report that dating feels harder than ever, the traditional solution—professional coaching at **$100-$300+ per hour**—remains out of reach for most people.

According to [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/02/02/key-findings-about-online-dating-in-the-u-s/), **30% of U.S. adults** have used online dating, with **1 in 10 partnered adults** meeting their current significant other through a dating site or app. Among partnered adults under 30, that number rises to **1 in 5**. Dating apps work—but success requires strategic knowledge that most users lack.

[**Free AI for Dating App Advisor**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) directly addresses this inequality by making sophisticated dating coaching accessible to everyone. For people who can't afford $150+ per session for human coaching, for those experiencing dating app burnout without knowing how to improve, and for anyone who needs guidance at 11 PM before a first date—this accessibility is transformative.

# Transform Your Dating Success Today

Dating app success in 2025 requires more than good looks or luck—it demands strategic thinking, platform knowledge, and continuous optimization. [**Free AI for Dating App Advisor**](https://www.jenova.ai/a/dating-app-advisor) provides the expert guidance, honest feedback, and personalized coaching you need to transform your dating outcomes.

With [**over 350 million people worldwide**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/) using dating apps and [**91% of users**](https://www.forbes.com/health/dating/dating-statistics/) reporting that dating feels harder than ever, standing out requires a systematic approach. By focusing on:

* Data-driven profile optimization with 4-6 high-quality photos
* Compelling bios that express genuine interest in others
* Platform-specific strategies for algorithm success
* Conversation skills that convert matches to dates
* Continuous improvement based on your actual results

You position yourself for meaningful success in the competitive 2025 dating landscape.

My dad has no respect for hygiene and has really poor habits that disgust me. 

He’s constantly fiddling with his nose - pulling out hairs, twisting them, picking etc. If it’s not his nose, it’s his ears, and same thing - pulling hairs, twisting, digging for ear wax. He’s always rubbing his feet and his feet stink. One time I saw him clipping his toe nails, scratch his face with the same hands he was using to dig into his toes, and then he blew his nose into the same tissue with his toe clippings. He doesn’t brush his teeth, only occasionally uses mouthwash. He sneezes, sometimes into his hand, and then proceeds to rub it into his face or continue around the kitchen. I’ve seen him blow his nose into the ground (thankfully outside but still in the back yard) like a spit from his nostrils - by blocking one side and giving a big blow - no tissue, and just carry on. 

Besides this, there’s other practises that give me the absolute ick. His diet is horrendous, where to even begin... He doesn’t cook, just boiled potato, egg, bread and garlic. Sometimes instant noodles as a bonus. He doesn’t put this away in the fridge… he leaves it out overnight for days and still eats the same thing off the stove for days, even if I put in the fridge he puts it back out. 6 heaped teaspoons of sugar in instant coffee several times a day. He’s learnt ‘sugar is bad’ after his doctor told him he’s looking diabetic, so now it’s honey or syrup in everything because in his mind that curbs the issue… also cake isn’t sugar because he can’t see the granules. He puts honey and syrup in his potato and egg, alongside his sickly sweet coffee. He doesn’t shower as frequently as he should and often smells. His laundry smells awful even after a wash because he doesn’t use detergent properly. His gut is mess… it’s diarrhoea all the time. Of course it is…

Because of all this, he’s dumb and foggy-brained all the time. He laughs things off or goes away for a sook. It’s reached a point where I can barely see any of his positive qualities anymore. He’s only getting older and I’m disgusted more every day. 

Looking at all this together, I think he just likes being gross… it started as playful ‘eww dad!’ laughing and playing when we were little, to more gentle confrontations, and as we’ve gotten older and the disrespect for hygiene become louder there’s bitter resentment, horror, and ostracism and he just ignores it all as if we’re the problem. He has other infantile behaviour that exacerbates all of this but that’s another can of worms. 

Is anyone able to explain why he’s like this, and whether this is a mental illness, and if so what it is?",1,1766043343.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

my friend has been unemployed for over a year and started job hunting in september and got two interviews within a week of applying, got a job, quit, applied to another place, got the job and it pays more than minimum wage.  my friend only had two months of retail experience while i had two years of barista and server experience and they accomplished more than i have in four months than i have in ten

another friend got offered, not interviewed, OFFERED two jobs at places i want to work at (rejected both) and they dont have retail experience either (well tbf they volunteered at a hospital for a few months)

im pretty sure my friends were able to land these jobs because they have more relevant experience and they have more connections than i do and im really happy for them but it stings realizing i wasted my time at that coffee shop instead of some store and working as a barista again is probably my only option atp

im also just frustrated because i finished my exams early so i have one month to do absolutely nothing ",1,1766042194.0,Vent,1,1.0,False
1ppkole,https://i.redd.it/xv4idh4oww7g1.jpeg,GE Refrigerator periodically gets into state where compressor runs for excessive period of time,"GE fridge model PSHS6PGZBESS, circa 2005.

A bit of history.

Fridge has had no problems for the 2.5 years since we bought this house. About 3 weeks ago, I tried to get water from the front dispenser and nothing came out. Opened the freezer and found that ice in the ice maker was melting and frozen items were starting to thaw. But things in the fridge were far colder than they should have been. I had a bluetooth temp sensor in the fridge, but not the freezer. I believe the fridge was about 30 degrees. Moved everything out of the freezer to another freezer to give myself a chance to troubleshoot.

Got into the diag menu and everything I tried testing worked. Turning on the defrost heater, I could see (and feel) the heater getting very warm. Fan test cycled through all of the fans. Removed the duct in top of the fridge and could see the damper move when running the damper test. And the temperatures displayed on the front panel of the fridge were consistent with the fridge and freezer temps. After some time of putzing around with no answers,  I put things back together and let it sit and the temps both stabilized back to normal.

I put a second bluetooth temp sensor in the freezer so that I could monitor it and set up alerts if either the fridge or freezer temps went out of bounds.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday. At 5:30AM, my alert woke me up that the fridge had dropped below my alert value. Checking my graphs, I immediately noticed 2 things:
1. The fridge and freezer temps had both been dropping continuously since the night before
2. Based on the power monitor that I have on this circuit in the breaker panel, the compressor had been running continuously during that period (yeah, duh, or else it wouldn't have been getting colder).

I tried a couple things at first: 1) Turned off the breaker, then back on after about 5 seconds, and b) test the defroster again. Power cycle didn't change anything - compressor was still running continuously. Defroster came on when tested.

Temp on the front panel of the fridge about this time was 0 for the freezer and 36 for the fridge (setpoints are 0 and 37). It seems like the temp thermistors are working, which is consistent with what I saw the first time.

I let it go for a little bit, curious if it would show the same pattern as last time: overly cold fridge and freezer no longer freezing. Sure enough, a while later, sure enough, the freezer temp starting climbing rapidly.

I then did the ""Refrigerator Reset"" option (opt 15) in the diag menu. This is approximately at the time of the green vertical line in the graphs. I was hopeful because fairly soon, the temp slopes started to change, but curiously the compressor was still apparently running. But eventually it all evened out and the compressor stopped and everything went back to normal.

Now today, I get an alert that the freezer is colder than expected. Looks like the same pattern again. Compressor has been running longer than normal. Freezer temp has dropped significantly and fridge risen slightly. Fairly sure the damper will flip soon and the fridge temp will start dropping.

One thing to note on the graphs -- the highest spikes that you see are the coffee maker, which is on the same breaker as the fridge.

All I can really fathom is that perhaps sometimes the contactor for the compressor is occasionally getting stuck in the closed position? Not sure why else the compressor would continuously run like this. Note that my BT temp sensors are not calibrated to the fridge temp sensors. I may do that as a next step to try to further rule out the temp sensors, but from what I've seen, the thermistors think it's cold enough in there while the compressor is still pumping away.",1,1766042159.0,Appliances,2,1.0,False

apps like Calm? they annoy the hell out of me.  
meditation? my head wont shut up for a second.

nothing worked because no one was hitting the root cause:  
its not your sleep thats broken. its the anxiety that sees ""bedtime"" as a threat.

after years obsessing over this, reading way too much research... i put together a short protocol that disarms that trigger before you even lie down.  
its not meditation. not deep breathing. not ""just relax.""

before: hours tossing in bed, days wrecked.  
now: i fall asleep in 15-45 minutes most nights. about 60-70%. not perfect, but shit... it changed everything.

honestly idk if this works for everyone. some nights it still sucks tbh

but if nothing else is working… give this a try.

We picked up a 2022 OAH on Friday. The car had 11,000 km since it was used for test drives, so we got a great price. It is fully loaded with features I had never even heard of. We were blown away.

Three days later, I started the car and noticed it would not go into electric mode. It stayed in hybrid mode and showed the message Electric Mode Temporarily Unavailable. After about 30 minutes of driving, the message disappeared and electric mode came back.

Four days later, the car would not auto lock or unlock, which felt odd. The electric mode issue happened again.

On the fifth day, I went to the car and saw the charging port LEDs blinking like crazy. That already felt wrong. I got into the car, pressed start, and everything went wild. Warnings everywhere. Engine error, brake error, traction system malfunction, stop the car or it will explode, and so on. It was terrifying. But it made no sense that all systems could fail at once.

I searched online and the first result pointed to the 12V battery, or maybe 14V, not even sure anymore, it was early and I had no coffee. I called Opel and they said they needed to take the car in and that it could take weeks. I insisted it was the 12V battery, but customer support claimed it was likely a bigger issue.

Since we were about to leave for the mountains with the whole family, I called a local service technician. He came out, pressed a few buttons, and within 15 minutes confirmed the 12V battery was basically dead. He explained the car had probably not been used for months and the battery slowly died. He cleared all the errors and started the car.

I drove to the nearest service center and 30 minutes later drove out with a new 12V battery installed.

So if your car suddenly goes crazy, stay calm and call your local service technician. I would not call Opel again. It felt like they had no idea what was going on.",1,1766042045.0,opel,1,1.0,False

1ppke2a,https://i.redd.it/1g1p4oduuw7g1.png,Guilt,"Hey everyone, I left this man in August and have maintained no contact since then. He tried to reach out in September via new number and was a little hostile in his messages. Tried to say he didn't understand my logic, that I left him when he was trying to become a better person. I left him while he was in rehab. I didn't reply and blocked. 

He then sent a mutual friend to message me in October and said he was moving soon and he wanted to apologize in person before leaving. I didn't respond to this either. My hope was that he moved and it was just done with. I wondered if he found a new victim who agreed to house him, that hurt but I wasn't shocked if it had happened. This text kind of proves that he lied about moving or changed his plans. He probably used it as a tactic to try and make me feel he would be gone forever if I don't respond.

I was getting used to the idea of maybe never seeing him again. I have been less stressed and happier. He was an alcoholic with housing instability. Cheater, porn/sex addict. He posted sex ads, smeared me to friends (I do know that he has been talking shit and lying about me very recently). When we met I was an active addict as well, I will be 3 years sober on the 29th. He sulked when I made it to a year sober. 

So our lifestyles changed and I found his cheating, emotional games, stonewalling, and triangulation with my own friends unbearable in my new state of clarity. I gave so many chances. He always dismissed my feelings, would go silent if I expressed pain, and generally treated me like a sex toy, ATM, and therapist with zero reciprocity. He doesn't know my fucking birthday. Everyone else was treated better than me, no exceptions. 

So why do I see this block bypass and feel an urge to respond? The thing is, I haven't responded because when I think of what I would say, I got nothing!! I wrote a brutally honest response in my notes app but I know it would feed him. I know he wouldn't even read the shit much less acknowledge it. He won't name his crimes or show empathy for what I was put through. How can I feel like I am doing the right thing? Cognitively I know it but my insides are squirming with guilt and sadness.

1ppkdwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/comments/1ppkdwe/neighbors/,Neighbors,"Here is a story that will blow any suburban housewife—or gay stay-at-home dad—away. We have this new neighbor; I’ll call her Koo-Koo for the time being. She is what most would describe as a pill-popping, alcoholic, wannabe Facebook influencer who hides her insecurities behind her bullshit “peace and love, no hater” Facebook posts. In reality, she is what I would call a “PLASTIC”—if you get my Mean Girls reference. With her two or three baby daddies and four children, one of whom she doesn’t really see, one has to wonder: could it be that the father doesn’t want the child around her pill-popping, alcoholic tendencies? I’m not really sure. She now has a new husband, which allows her to sit around her $500k house counting that money, baby. Her only worry is that our Starbucks closed—because unfortunately, we all live in a small town where not everyone can afford an $8.00 coffee twice a day. Let me just tell you: she did her influencer duties and voiced her grievances, complaining about Rural King and how it should close. Meanwhile, the rest of the town relies on a store like that! Newsflash, KOOKOO—nobody gives a flying fuck that it wasn’t convenient for you. She then proceeds to drag this out all over social media, with a shitty attempt to pose in front of one of our local coffee shops in an effort to get back into the town’s good graces. If you were to ask me my thoughts and opinions on her, only a few things come to mind: attention seeker, gold digger, personality disorder, as well as paranoia (I’ll elaborate on that one in a few sentences). You see, I once liked this neighbor—until she decided to hide behind a screen across the street, calling a friend of mine “community trash” because my friend wasn’t a fan of her lawn ornaments. It wasn’t her style, which is perfectly okay. You don’t have to like the way everyone decorates. My friend did not go around telling everyone or take her grievances to a public forum to voice her opinions on lawn ornaments—unlike KOOKOO.

KOOKOO couldn’t handle the fact that she wasn’t the shining fucking star she likes to think she is. In fact, she’s just like everyone else: someone who is insecure and maybe can’t handle the fact that not everyone is going to love what she loves. And once again, that’s okay. My friend did voice some of the things she loved, but she knew she didn’t have to hurt KOOKOO’s feelings by voicing things that weren’t necessarily her favorite—because sometimes, you don’t have to be that kind of asshole. My friend even went as far as backing her when the Ice Queen down the street didn’t let her into her old-money clique. And honestly, I’ll give the Ice Queen credit—she saw through KOOKOO’s cheap, money-grabbing, wannabe Chanel bag and ran for the old-money hills. Especially after KOOKOO blasted her so badly on Facebook that she had to unfriend her because she was tired of seeing the hate. All this from someone who loves to preach her “peace and love” bullshit. In reality, she uses her “influencer” status to bully those around her and seek validation from total internet strangers. My thoughts? She doesn’t get enough attention from her new husband once the multiple credit-card bills come out.

Oh, I almost forgot to mention: KOOKOO went as far as posting a Facebook story accusing my friend and her family of breaking her ugly black-and-white checkered $1,000 deer that she flaunted all over Facebook—calling them, once again, “trash.” Only to later realize it had broken once before and her husband had merely stuck the antlers back on—the same week we had 30-mph winds. What does that sound like? Oh, I’m so glad you asked: P-A-R-A-N-O-I-A. Because my friend—with a broken back—is definitely going to walk over at 3 a.m. and break a deer nobody gives a shit about.

These are the complaints of a lonely, insecure, money-counting housewife. I only wish the rest of this impoverished town had to worry about buying a second or third $1,000 black-and-white checkered ugly-ass deer. But wait—there’s more. Let’s get into CRAZY C. Could the “C” stand for cunt? Hmmm… I don’t know, but that’s definitely a possibility. CRAZY C lives down the street. My friend happened to introduce KOOKOO and CRAZY C—now known as the second plastic—because she wanted KOOKOO to feel like she had allies in the neighborhood after the Ice Queen iced her out. I guess it’s true what they say: a snake in the grass will always come back to bite you in the ass—especially when one has a face longer than a horse’s ass that’s tighter than Simon Cowell’s face after Botox, and the other looks like a bus ran it over.

You’re probably thinking, Wow, this writer sounds pretty cunty herself. To that I say: thank you. Because I’m angry. I’m angry after having to sit by and watch this. I’m angry after CRAZY C decided it was okay to tell KOOKOO private things about my friend and her family—for drama, and because she was bored with her own shitty life. Did my friend air out CRAZY C’s private business? No. But I guess I will—where to start, I wonder? Pregnant at 14? No, because I know teen mothers who actually took care of their babies—unlike her—who didn’t take them to crack houses four years later with cracked-out boyfriends, resulting in the death of an innocent child in a car wreck that was completely her fault because she was under the influence. Or how about her affair with her now-husband? Even better—her lesbian sister-in-law who served ten years in prison for attempting to poison her lover’s husband. I won’t go into detail, unlike her—but I guess we all have some form of dirty laundry.

At least she’s found her true friend now—another pill-popping, alcoholic housewife. They can both be lonely, alcoholic, pill-popping cunts together. Who knows—maybe CRAZY C will follow in KOOKOO’s footsteps and become an influencer with bullshit “peace and love” advice. I know it hurts my friend, especially because they were friends for four years—while CRAZY C and KOOKOO have only been friends since Halloween night. My friend, who is a healthcare professional, would go to CRAZY C’s house to help her now-deceased in-laws who had dementia and needed assistance with basic care like bathing or being picked up when they fell—even though it worsened her broken back and hip.

CRAZY C allowed her in-laws to live in absolute squalor. I know this because I went to help a few times. They lived in the basement apartment of CRAZY C’s home, where the smell of piss was so overwhelming I had to go outside and vomit—while she lived upstairs in her clean, fresh-linen-smelling Febreze palace. The number of times my friend saved them from having to call 911—because they were dangerously close to being taken to court for elder abuse—is sickening.

You see, you can do all the kind things in the world, try to do the right thing, and expect nothing in return—and still encounter foes along the way. People you once thought were close friends, until you uncover the truth of deception, pettiness, and downright disgusting human behavior. Yet my friend is labeled “community trash” because some of KOOKOO’s lawn décor wasn’t her favorite. So there you have it, folks—the real story of the Plastics.

I felt like I had been so productive all day, plus I got a lot done on my Monday coworking call so I didn’t feel motivated to do anything. So I just kept enjoying the convo with my friend even though I knew I was procrastinating by hyper focusing but I couldn’t stop, even though I still had work to do. 

At the same time, this morning it hit me just how much I had to do. Everything made sense because the meds help make things clear. But I still got overwhelmed I think because I’m not used to that level of seeing things clearly ahead of time. Usually I’m relying on the anxiety of being last minute about everything to get stuff done.

I guess I was just confused because I thought my meds were supposed to help me…but it’s still on me to prioritize my focus I guess 😂

I also had a cup of coffee in the afternoon which is typically fine with my dose but maybe it was too strong today? Idk!

Would appreciate any advice on how to proactively make the best of the medication’s benefits because I understand it’s not a magic pill and there’s still work I need to put in lol.",1,1766040945.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

New to this subreddit (and glad this one exists). Just want to share my grandmas story and if you feel inclined, any input would be appreciated. I just don't know what to think right now. 

My grandma is 70 years old and went in for hip replacement yesterday morning. She was so so excited to get this done because she was in a lot of pain when she walked. She was making plans already for trips she wanted to take after she was healed from this surgery...going back to Ireland, NYC, and Japan are on her list. 

She got out of surgery yesterday around 2pm, the surgeon said everything went great, zero issues, all according to plan. My grandma was taking back to her room after recovery and was awake and talking. I wasn't there for this, but my mom was. She was talking with my mom for about 15 minutes, then the PT workers came in and got my grandma up and had her try and walk around s and do their PT. She wanted to sit on the cushioned recliner in her room, so she did and the PT left. 

My mom said she dozed off in the chair 10 min later, and my mom went out to the hospitals cafe to get a coffee. All of a sudden she heard ""code blue, room 123"" on the louspeaker, and she realized it was Grandma's room. She ran up to see 5 people in her room, doing CPR. Security explained that she went into cardiac arrest. 

The staff got her heart started again, and they took her to ICU immediately. She went into a coma after this happened. They did a CT, MRI, EKG and EEG on her over the next 10 hours, and came to the conclusion she had a fat embolism which stopped her heart, and then was oxygen deprived for about 5-7 minutes. Apparently she can't breathe on her own, and ""will be in a vegetative state"" from now on. 

I'm just devastated. The last thing I told her was ""can't wait to see you when you get home, I know it's going to go great"". Literally like being hit across my head with a baseball bat is how I feel, confused to hell and lost. Why wouldn't they have her hooked up to heart monitors in her room? This likely would have saved her. Why was she up and talking, then shortly after PT she went into cardiac arrest? Was it the movement during PT that triggered this fat embolism? So many questions, and I don't think any answers will make sense to me.

Do you like coffee? But hate people. And now I have to make a choice of whether or not it's worth it due to a long line of people that want that pumpkin spice.

Are You a vampire trying to get his fix, but almost joked 12 × today, because turtlenecks are making a comeback. D***, YOU VELMA COSPLAYERS!!

Did your parent decide teach you the valuable lessons of responsibility by making you rank the leaves during a 24/7 marathon of POKÉMON!!

For this story my sisters name Is Alice and my step mom’s name is Janice. 

My father has been gone for 10 years now, my dad and Janice have a kid who’s 10. 

Before i begin I would like to list what has happened since he passed, I wasn’t allowed any property of my fathers until I got my own place (which I do now) I wasn’t allowed to know where he was buried (I snooped and found out after 7 yrs after his passing) , and I wasn’t allowed to have anything even non valued items. 

Last year Janice invited me to my father’s grave just to later disinvite me, I was so distraught. That was so rude. So I turned to my sister and vented to her thinking she would understand and keep my rant confidential. Alice told Janice and withheld that information from me for months. 
My exact words were “tell Janice she’s being a f—-ing bi—ch. “ after that I let everything be, dropped it and pushed it behind me. Instead it gets worse. On my birthday, not only did I support my sister, through Janice was saying we are  harassing her and both me and Alice can’t contact her again, but I was blamed for calmly explaining to Janice.  Which the day before my birthday I wrote a heartfelt message to Janice on why I’m angry and why I’m sorry for calling her a rude name. Which to Janice said we could meet for coffee and talk, just to later find out she contacted police and claimed I’m harassing her. She twisted my words and played the victim, my sister blamed me and said I’m making it all worse. 

A piece of what I said was “I’m not appreciating how you are giving empty promises with saying I’ll get my father’s belongings when I have never gotten them.  I need actions.” Apparently I was too hostile and everyone agrees. Today I was on FaceTime with my sister and she accidentally admitted Everytime I would vent about Janice (which Alice would agree to everything I said) it would all be taken and fed back to Janice. 

Now I may never get my father’s things and it’s affecting me really deeply, so I’m wondering if anyone has been through the same thing and what should I do? ",1,1766040607.0,u_cassie-sage,0,1.0,False

1ppk5fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ppk5fz/rf_once_before_christmas/,"[RF] Once, Before Christmas","Max woke to an insistent knock at the door. He opened his eyes and checked his iPhone. Five a.m.
Carefully, he slipped out of bed, trying not to wake Lena, pulled on his dressing gown, and went to the door.

“Your time is over. Will you extend it?” asked a man in a tracksuit, a dragon tattoo curling up his neck. It was Lena’s new pimp, Sergei. The old one had been arrested last week for carrying a weapon.

Max shook his head.

“Then tell her I’m waiting in the car,” Sergei said, already heading down the stairs.

Max closed the door, relieved by the silence, and went into the kitchen to make toast and coffee. Half an hour later, the apartment smelled of fresh coffee and buttered toast.

***

Katya walked along the main street, studying shop windows. Christmas was coming, and she still had gifts to buy — for her relatives, and for Max. Last Christmas, she had given him a luxurious shaving kit. This year, the gift had to be just as good, if not better.

“Real watches for real men,” read a sign in a shop window.

“That’s it,” she thought, stepping inside.

She chose a Vacheron Constantin Patrimony — not because it was expensive, but because it was elegant. The watch was impossibly thin, smooth beneath her fingers, its polished case catching the light without demanding attention. The dial was calm and perfectly balanced, marked only by slender gold indices and hands that moved with quiet confidence. It was the kind of watch a man wouldn’t show off, but would wear every day, until it became part of his gestures, his habits, his life.

She imagined it on his wrist and smiled. Some gifts speak loudly. This one simply stayed.

Beaming, she left the shop, thinking she should go see Max.

***

Lena was ready to leave when someone knocked at the door.

“It must be Sergei. He was here this morning,” Max called from the shower.

Lena opened the door and saw a well-dressed young woman.

“Hello. What do you want?” Lena asked.

“I want to see Max,” the woman said.

“Come in. He’s in the shower. He’ll be out in five minutes,” Lena replied, stepping aside.
“By the way, I’m Lena. What’s your name?”

“Katya,” the woman said.

She stepped carefully over a pair of men’s jeans, glanced at the unmade bed, and walked toward the bathroom.

“Katya!” Max exclaimed. “What are you doing here?”

Instead of answering, Katya slapped him across the face and walked out, slamming the door.

Lena locked the door and went into the bathroom.

“What was that?” she asked.

“That was my girlfriend,” Max said. “My ex, apparently.”

“So, will you be alone on Christmas?” Lena asked after a pause. “If you want, I can keep you company. It’s easier not to be alone that night.”

“Deal,” he said, touching his cheek and feeling a small warmth he didn’t expect.

***

Time passed slowly. Sergei sat in his car, killing time with a crossword. Then everything happened at once.

The entrance door slammed. A young woman slipped on the ice-covered sidewalk and went down hard.

Sergei jumped out of the car and ran toward her.

“Are you okay?” he asked.

The woman moaned and tried to get up.

“Do you need an ambulance?” he asked.

“I’m fine,” she said. “Just a few bruises. Please help me up.”

Sergei helped her to her feet and led her to a nearby bench.

“I’m really tired of this blasted cold,” the woman complained.

“Yeah,” Sergei said. “Yesterday my neighbor slipped too and broke his foot. He’s in the hospital now.”

She sat down and sighed. “Thank you for your help.”

“My pleasure,” Sergei replied.

The woman rummaged through her bag. Suddenly her face went pale.

“My watch,” she said. “It’s broken.”

“Let me see,” Sergei said. “I used to be a watchmaker.”

He examined it carefully.

“Nothing serious,” he said. “The glass is cracked, that’s all. I can fix it — but only if you promise to have dinner with me.”

The woman smiled and nodded.

“Deal,” she said.

“My name is Sergei,” he said, handing the watch back.

“Katya,” she replied, thinking: maybe this Christmas won’t be as broken as her heart. Who knows.●",1,1766040203.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Some must try on our list:

Best sisig place (of course!) or maybe a place serving multiple superb local cuisines
Best Coffee shops
Somewhat special dining during the night where we can have a good dinner for our anniversary
Some 24 hour places we could stay in case we arrive early

Any recommendations would do!
It would be helpful for us to know if there would be parking at the place or if it would be better for us to book a grab going to the place!

1ppjzme,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeopleAdvice/comments/1ppjzme/older_men_messing_with_a_fan/,Older men messing with a fan,"two famous people did some odd things to me about 8 years ago. these two people were kirk and james of metallica and it involves witchcraft. It's a long story but I was supposedly supposed to meet Kirk hammett and lose my virginity to him years ago but he and james hetfield did some kind of bizarre things to me and they kept our interactions through this strange method. It was really wrong of them to do this and they acted as if I was so lucky to be getting their attention since they were 'metallica', but it was the strangest, weirdest most f\*cked up situation to exist. I was just a fan at their show and literally got victimized by them in the strangest way possible. They make their victims feel like they're lucky to get their attention in any way because they are 'metallica' and it's the dumbest thing to exist. Kirk also said they wanted a 'connection' to me for some reason no clue why.

i was also supposed to meet them but they had little interest in meeting me, and were just playing games. one even talked about marrying me. well james hetfield is dating some female named adriana and he even divorced his wife possibly because of the situation that was happening with us- it's a long drawn out story that involves weird paranormal stuff. It's not that i was anyone important to them and i reallly don't care but it pisses me off what they put me through and what I had to go through and in the end they just date their wives and girlfriends and used me as some side project to do weird sh\*t to. Kirk and james are both fakes and losers who do bad things to women and fans and they are capable of who knows what and this involves the things they do to fans secretly. They even invited me to go on tour years ago but didn't try to make it happen, it was like a fake invitation. Kirk said metallica would be my 'sex slaves' or some bullsh\*t and it was all fake and lies. Not that I care.

Kirk invited me to go witness his 'salem exhibit' in 2017 and I didn't trust he'd meet me so I didn't go. They even said they just wanted me in the audience chasing them or some nonsense and I had no interest in doing that. Kirk used to think that what they were doing to me was fascinating and interesting and wanted me posting it everywhere on social media to get attention but no one cared or believed it. I found one of their real groupies online once accidentally and kirk threatened me to never talk to her.

It pisses me off that adriana and their wives didn't have to go through weird bizarre sh\*t and have been treated nicely by these creeps. Basically, had I just met them at their first or second concert I went to this wouldn't have happened but because I didn't think they'd like me and didn't go up to the stage to meet them, then they invaded my life in some odd way and took advantage of me in the dumbest way possible for some form of control it seems. yeah they 'liked' me supposedly at their first show and wanted to meet me secretly and I had no idea and just took off. Had I known them in person this wouldn't have happened. Also I was supposedly supposed to marry james hetfield or they lead me on about it in some form but apparently that's not the case because after his divorce he was dating some other woman.

They're awful and not normal or nice people and it's a messed up situation. They do still think about me and i know this because of things I can't get into but really I'm not on the top of their list anymore. if it wasn't for some other weird sh\*t that happened to me Kirk hammett was trying to get me to meet them or just go and witness them at metallica night. I'm not even a fan but a part of me is still kind of bitter about all of this I can't get into all the different reasons why. James is just a betraying jerk and they are fake people who enjoy leading people on and doing bad weird crap to them. I'm not sure how to feel abotu this anymore

for instance- metallica cancelled their australian tour because of something that happened to me and they 'finally' played in australia finally after years.

they played in abu dhabi in december because my birthday is in december and its a long story

they came to daytona florida rockville and began playing in festivals because of me and now play in festivals regularly and started a skateboard and coffee company too because of this- this was years ago.

they did a lot of things pertaining to 'metallica' because of this game that was going on between us.

Kirk will never update his twitter because of what happened between us and the last thing he posted was of a black mercedes and it has to do with all of this.

If I post on metallica's twitter- james will post something odd secretly regarding something that happened between us years ago or he will ban me sometimes it's part of their game.

I told Kirk I like science so he and lars went to CERN and did a video on science and kirk made me watch it. Kirk used to make me watch videos to determine whether I would be attracted to him or not or just for fun who knows.

Now james is just some punk who has a girlfriend and doesn't care- what a prick. a part of me is just semi-bitter and i cant' get into why. James even did things with metallica's art concerning this situation and it involves a lot I can't get into. kirk said to me many years ago that 'metallica is nothing without me"" not sure why. anyway this is a very weird situation. I'm not sure how to feel about it and should probably just forget about it all..",0,1766039630.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,2,0.14,False

For context, I (F 23) and my Fiancé (M 25) had to move into my mother's (F 60) house due to financial struggles and our previous housing arrangement being pulled out from under us (whole other long ass story). We moved here at the start of September 2025, three and a half months ago, and due to past issues I had with my mother (which was the reason I moved out at 19 in the first place) I felt I had to sweeten the deal in order to be allowed back. I told her that we would cook and clean for her, as she has chronic pain and finds it hard to take care of herself and her house. It seemed like a win win situation so she allowed us both to move in with her. Before we even could move in, we had to gut out my old room that she was using as a hoarder's closet. When I say it was filled to the brim with garbage, recycling bags, Christmas decorations, random shit she just had no place for, cleaning supplies she never used, etc. I mean there wasn't a single inch of floor exposed and you could barely open the door. It took us two full days to gut and clean the room and we ended up leaving a pile of her garbage in the middle of the living room. It is still there. This will be relevant later in the story.

Due to us having to relocate, we both lost our jobs and in the current job market we looked for a good few months before finding even a minimum wage part-time job. I got a job at a fast food restaurant because it was the only interview I got out of 50+ applications. She is a registered nurse, currently off work due to pain/disability. She was getting \~$4600 a month on disability and $1200 a month from the tenant downstairs. A total of \~$5800 a month. I had personally gone through her finances for her and with all her bills (even the mortgage she had refinanced about three times over the past decade and had wracked up a hefty monthly bill), she could still afford all the groceries and essentials for the house while we both looked for jobs. Except she is a chronic gambler and goes through her monthly budget in less than a week. So I had to get a job in order to feed us all.

Once I finally started my job, my entire pay would go to my personal bills and then the rest would all go to groceries as I was the sole person who would meal plan, make a grocery list, and actually budget to make sure none of us starved/lived off Mr. Noodles. The job was physically and mentally draining (anyone in the service industry knows, especially if you are neurodivergent, you are constantly taken advantage of) so I would come home and immediately lay down and doom scroll to avoid the mental toll this was all taking on me. On my few days I had off I would clean up the kitchen and around the house, just small stuff I could handle all in one day each week.

What gets me is that every single day, no matter if I just cleaned the kitchen eight hours ago, the counters were always full of dishes (that could be easily rinsed off and put in the dishwasher), recyclables (while the recycling bags were five steps away), and random food items that are meant to be kept in the pantry. Her daily routine would be wake up at 2:00 PM, have a bagel and peanut butter with a coffee, leave all her crap out, play online poker on the couch, sleep, repeat. Yes she would take me to and from work as my fiancé and I don't have our own car yet, but that was simply because I couldn't afford Ubers and groceries. So rides to work=free personal chef and maid services.

None of that was good enough apparently. Eight (8) EIGHT hours into my holiday break she complains to me at 12:00 AM that the house is a mess and starts asking when it will all get done before Christmas. Ma'am it is December 18th. That pile of garbage is still there since she can't seem to wake up before the dump closes, and I have tried multiple times in the past few months to plan a day so she would actually get up on time and go through it with us to see what she wants to keep or toss. The bathroom was last cleaned a month ago, same with the porch and kitchen, and I haven't even touched the living room since she has random papers scattered around plus the pile of shit sitting there since September. My fiancé and I have planned a lot of days with our friends to celebrate the holidays so before Christmas we will be busy 4 out of 6 days. So she expects me to clean the whole house, help move my sister back in to her old room, prep and cook for Christmas eve/Christmas day, all in two days.

I am very sick of living situations where we have several adults in the house and I'm the sole one responsible for/expected to clean and maintain the household. Please tell me if I'm being unreasonable or if I'm actually valid in wanting a break. To me, yes I understand she is in chronic pain, but she is severely overweight (which I am to believe and her doctor believes is the main source of her pain and daily struggles) and refuses to do anything about it. She neglects to clean up after herself and expects me to do it all while juggling a job and soon University. I am mentally and physically drained, and just wanted a couple of weeks to relax and prepare for the months I will be busy 24/7. Am I the asshole or is she expecting too much out of me in the next week before Christmas?

Edit: Guys my Fiancé isn't a lazy bum, he's currently in trade school and literally does everything I ask him to. We are both fed up with my mom's BS",2,1766039298.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

Why do people dump their coffee/tea in the sink the moment it's like, slightly cold? Like sometimes it would mention that the character haven't even drank a sip yet they dump it in anyways.

Like I like the vibe it gives in the scene but it happens way too often to the point I'm like, ""Maybe this is something people deadass do...?"" It just seems like a waste TT idk about tea but coffee I actually like mixed with cold water so it would be warm and not scalding hot. Even my parents who doesn't like cold coffee always finish their mug so I know it's not something done by people who want hot coffee...
