1kq1n79,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1kq1n79/low_t3_only/,Low T3 ONLY,"Hi Friends! 

I have been on a rollercoaster of a health journey over the past 3 years‚Ä¶ but am FINALLY starting to feel better, but still have some issues and wanted some insight. 

I am currently on 125 mg of Sertraline for anxiety that I think is generational ü•≤ and my PCP has me on medication for low T3. 

Back in December, my TSH was 1.7, Free T4 was 1.07, and my Free T3 was 2.6. Antibodies were tested and came back negative for Hashimotos. 
My PCP started me on Liothyronine, got retested recently, and it ABSOLUTELY tanked my Free T4. 

I am now on 30 mg of NP Thyroid. 

I just have a few questions: 

1. I start off most Mondays feeling great, but by Friday my mood is so off (intrusive thoughts, feelings of masculinity, feeling tension in my gut, etc). Does this just mean that I need more thyroid medication? Or would this have to do more with my anxiety medication? My doctor is retesting my thyroid in 4 weeks! I also know that being an elementary music teacher and dealing with that stress probably doesn‚Äôt help either üò¨ 

2. I struggle so badly if I drink any coffee (even if it is decaf), have ANY caffeine (I get so angry and feel irrational), or any alcohol (feel SO bad the next day - so much stress/anxiety/irritability). Are these things that will improve once my T3 is in optimal range? Or are these more related to my anxiety? 


My doctor also prescribed 100 mg of oral progesterone to help with the mood disorder and I noticed that I was more ‚Äúcalm‚Äù feeling and able to tolerate the caffeine and alcohol better, but I could NOT deal with the constipation/bloating that came with taking this, so I stopped. 

I just have a hard time being patient for these things to resolve and am hoping that I will not have to cut out coffee/alcohol forever, but would love to hear if people have any it made a big difference?? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I grew up with a lot of ppl calling me ugly. then other ppl telling me I should model (tall & skinny). Sometimes ppl would tell me I have a very exotic (im white lol) or unique beauty. Left me quite insecure and conflicted about my looks. It also led to me being overly nice to people so I don't get attacked and called ugly. Im very nice to strangers. But im cautious and a bit reserved/aloof around peers and female friends as they are usually the ones who treated me poorly and berated me in the past. A lot of subtle insults or backhanded compliments. Its complicated I guess.

As I have gotten older I notice ppl are super nice to me, I have a very innocent looking face and am definitely very ""cute"", I dunno about pretty. Men tell me Im pretty a lot, approach me at the grocery store, ask for my number etc. Roughly once every couple months. but women ie friends of mine usually talk to me and insinuate that Im not pretty (indirectly) like while talking about dating and stuff. My female friends compliment my one friend and say how pretty she is, but the compliments I get from them is that im nice and caring.  Occasionally either men or older women will stop me and tell me im beautiful. I get asked out a lot but have a hard time keeping a guy, tbh. They tend to just want me for casual, it seems. Which Im not into.

Out in the world, I do notice a lot of positives. Free drinks from bartenders all night, random guys paying for my drinks, or mine and my friends drinks if its a sit down place and they hear its my birthday or something, free coffees at shops, getting hired on the spot if i go in person, free food/discounts at restaurants bc the server liked me, people always remember my face, not being charged late penalties and stuff, and the other day I went to a gym where I cancelled my membership a long time ago but I asked to buy a day pass which I confirmed by email was 30 dollars, but the guy at the desk told me to just use the gym for free.

I do think im cute enough, but I don't think I am conventionally all that pretty. If anything maybe I appeal to men but not as much women. Is it possible that the fact Im kind and have a face that looks ""nice"" and am genuinely a nice person and super polite and ppl can feel my aura, giving me extra privilege in society?

For instance my brother has a similar temperament and I notice strangers treat him well too. I think that getting free stuff is not always down to pretty privilege. And as someone who works in social services, primarily dealing w ppl who are NOT happy, I am a lot more likely to go above & beyond for people I just met who meet me with politeness, respect and a smile. Its not about if theyre hot. Just food for thought but im curious as to your guys opinions as well.",1,1747623579.0,prettyprivilege,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a stay at home mom with a big dream: starting a small coffee business from home.
This dream means everything to me 
it's more than a business idea; it's a piece of who l am.

I‚Äôve been working with what I have and pouring love into every cup, practicing daily but now I‚Äôm hoping to take the next big step. 

I'm not in a position to afford brand-new equipment, but I'm hopeful that the right path will open up through kindness and connection. I'm looking for a used commercial espresso machine, grinder, or any caf√© equipment that someone might be willing to sell at an affordable price in the area. 

I know it's a big ask, but I also believe in starting where I am, with what I have, and trusting that my work ethic and dedication will carry me forward. If you know of any local businesses upgrading their equipment or even anyone willing to part with something they're no longer using that could be helpful to me, I would be so incredibly grateful. Even guidance or a nudge in the right direction will mean the world!

I don‚Äôt care about changing initials because I truly hope you see this, even though I know you won‚Äôt. There is so much I wish I could tell you, I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start. How could I tell you what I feel for you? I don‚Äôt even think we‚Äôve been in a room alone for more than five minutes. I don‚Äôt know your favorite color. I don‚Äôt know what scares you, i don‚Äôt know your favorite food, who you talk to the most, I don‚Äôt know anything about you, still, I feel like I know you inside out. 

I see you. You see me. I know you do. I can feel it, and I always could. You have the kindest eyes I have ever seen. You have a smile that makes me want to stare at your face forever and smile right back. I genuinely do not understand how you aren‚Äôt chased by fifteen different women at all times. You are the safest man I know of, and, again - I barely know you! I don‚Äôt know you, but I feel like we have known each other forever. I don‚Äôt know you, but I truly know you are a good person. When I was twelve, I used to scroll online, read romantic quotes, make up stupid scenarios about me and my stupid crushes. I do the same to you. If only you knew how many nights I‚Äôve been wanting nothing more than to lay in your arms. We wouldn‚Äôt have to talk. Our eyes would communicate in their own language. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ever dare to kiss me. Still, we would end up kissing - I‚Äôd cross my own fears to make up for all the lost time, it‚Äôs only fair. One of the many things I read online as a twelve year old was ‚ÄúWhatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same‚Äù. Cheesy as hell (not in the context of the book, of course!), and also exactly how I feel about us. We are the same. It terrifies me. You make me feel like I‚Äôm twelve again.

I don‚Äôt know how you feel about me. Recently I‚Äôve been wondering whether you‚Äôre trying to signal something. You do not understand what your love would mean to me and I did not sleep a minute last night. The idea that you could be longing for me, even just a little, brought me perhaps the most joy I‚Äôve felt so far in my short 20 years. Maybe I‚Äôm not completely delusional, maybe you too see how we just might be perfect for each other. At the same time, my heart aches. We don‚Äôt have the time to find out. It‚Äôs my fault, again. 

I wish you knew how I felt without me having to tell you. I want you to know how beautiful you are. You are so stunning. How I have never wanted anyone in the way I want you. How I have never genuinely enjoyed the presence of a person as much as yours. How reassuring it was to have you there, more reassuring than the person that should‚Äôve been my comfort. I wish I could tell you how I was longing for you before I got with him. I wish I could tell you how complicated the foundations of me and his relationship was. I wish I could explain to you why I stayed for so long, although I don‚Äôt think even I know the complete answer to that. What I do know is that it was a pathetic choice, one that I will regret probably for as long as I breathe. While it lasted, I thought I could shut our connection off. When that didn‚Äôt work, I tried to redirect it. Twist it and shape it into whatever I could which did not involve me in dishonesty. That worked for a while. And when it didn‚Äôt, I shut down. I couldn‚Äôt really escape you - not in my thoughts, not in my heart, not in your apartment. I felt so ashamed, which was well-deserved. I am not trying to justify that. 

You asked me if I missed the city after Christmas break. I told you I did not. Last Christmas, I went home with the intention of making up my mind about leaving him. But really, I had already made up my mind. The possibility of getting together with you was never a factor in that - I thought it impossible after the choice I made two years ago. I would not want to hurt him (even though he has hurt me), and I know you wouldn‚Äôt either. I told my friend that I think I like you because you‚Äôre the type of person who wouldn‚Äôt get with his friend‚Äôs ex girlfriend. Ironic, right? I just could not bear the guilt. My mind was made up, yet I knew I could not be completely honest with him. That would have served no purpose, it would have made him resent you, it would have made me hate myself. 

Now, I‚Äôm not saying me and him ended purely because of my feelings for you, far from it. Our relationship was full of holes. Of broken trust, different values and a lack of genuine attraction, I believe. He would give you some entirely different answer if you asked. I wonder if you ever asked. I doubt it. I loved him, but I did not like him. Sometimes I think he got with me to prove to himself that he could. I didn‚Äôt think he could. I didn‚Äôt want him to, not in the beginning. He never really gave me an option. I wish I could explain it all to you. I think you think that he broke up with me. And he did, kind of, though I was going to end it either way. I don‚Äôt think he is mature enough to truly love anyone just yet, not in a romantic sense- maybe I‚Äôm just a bit bitter, I don‚Äôt know. I think I was trying to fix him in that sense, just as I tried to fix many of his other problems. I know that was never my job. I am quite the devout lover, whether romantic or platonic, that much I know, and it unfortunately led me to tolerate things I should not have. I did not respect myself enough at the time to realize many of these things. I tried to forgive him for the things he had done, and I really, truly wanted to. But I ultimately could not. 

I do think you feel something for me. I don‚Äôt know exactly what, how much, or since when. But I hope I am interpreting the signals right, even if they weren‚Äôt intentionally put there for me to interpret. They probably weren‚Äôt. If they were, you would‚Äôve reached out more often, I tell myself. I‚Äôve thought about asking you to meet me for coffee, just as friends, just before I leave this city for good. But I don‚Äôt know what the point would be. I would enjoy your presence, I think you would enjoy mine, and we would have a couple of hours just to ourselves, for the very first time. Then I would go home and my heart would be even more full of love and admiration. Maybe the same would happen to you, maybe the opposite would, I do not know. Still, it would not change anything. If we mentioned everything that‚Äôs been under the surface, there would be no going back from that, and still I would be leaving. My own choice hurts more than I can put into words. I considered staying, only to realize it would mostly be for you - for an unlikely, complicated, maybe-possibly-there-chance of you: I can‚Äôt do that to myself, as I would likely break my own heart. This way, it‚Äôs not broken. It‚Äôs just reserved for you for some time, just in case you would end up where I do. I like to think that we‚Äôll meet again under different circumstances in a few years. Not too many, that I could not bear. I hope to get lucky enough to meet you again, this time not as someone‚Äôs something, just as my own person. 
I hope you‚Äôll be single, and if not, it‚Äôs karma, only fair, though I do not know how I would cope. I hope you have not had feelings for me all this time. I don‚Äôt want to have been one who hurts you, although unintentionally. If I have, I am really, truly sorry. 

I have learned a lot of things these past two years. And I have decided that I will never enter a relationship with someone I don‚Äôt like as much as I like you. You set my new, much-needed standard.  I know how irrational it is to say that I love you. Still, you‚Äôve carved yourself deep into my heart in ways I did not expect, and calling it anything other than love feels laughable to me. I love everything I know about you. I need to find out more about you; either to disprove the feelings of my heart, or to open it to you in its entirety. I really, really hope we meet again. Dear GOD I hope we meet again. 


- your friend (I hope you still consider me that), A :‚Äô)

1300 calories per day (I was eating around 900  until about 6 or so weeks ago, but was told by a nutritionist that I needed to increase to 1300-1450). I eat approximately 180g of protein eat day.

The given agreement was that i will cover all living expenses and feed them for the first month, then we would all work together to get a larger place to live more comfortably since 4 of us here would be pretty crammed given the size of my rental (my and my fiancee were cozy here, but having another couple definitely complicated having privacy). I asked to split rent and utilities, and they agreed, it made me happy cause it would help have extra money around to save/get things me and my fiancee need.

First month was fine, i again told them i would feed them and pay for anything needed the first month, then we split half of rent and utilities ($1400 a month rent, $130 for internet and power bill that varied) after the first month passed. I also bought them new clothes and other random things they would need to help get back on their feet, given they left some things behind to come here, i was happy to.

One of them got a job and they gave me the first half of living expenses after 2 weeks of working and everything seemed fine, then they brought up they needed a new car too given theirs was in bad condition, so they asked for reduced rent. Given my fiancee was amazing to me and I did like the in laws so far, i agreed to JUST half of rent ($700), and i would cover the utilities ($130 for internet, the power was now around $150-200 now with 4 people, before it averaged $100-130). I was happy at the time to accommodate this.

Fast forward 5 months from then, they struggled to pay the $700 a month every time. I was cool with it, until their car broke down and it turns out they didn‚Äôt spend a single dime to save up or attempt to get anything else to drive. They had a personal agreement between them that when one would get the other something gift wise, the other had to get something as well in equal value. Keep in mind only one of them was working so it meant they were blowing all their money on new computer parts, in app purchases and endless orders from amazon. Not only were they able to not pay the $750, I at most received $500 a month from them.

I got fed up and was pissed, made it clear to them that they NEED to save up or get out, given they were VERY behind on rent. Given STILL that my fiancee was amazing and it was just her family i had a single problem with, i came up with the ‚Äúgenius ü§¶ ‚Äú idea of not charging them rent so they could save up and move out as soon as possible.

Fast forward another 5 months of them living here expense free, they have no money, made one desperate attempt to buy a rv, and I have zero privacy and am violating my lease agreement with them being here.

They are loud and argue a lot, blasted music non stop the first few months of being here despite endless times of me asking them to turn it down, and mostly, they brought a severe roach infestation with them.

I get them bringing it here may have been not their fault, but fuck. I have been in my place for over 4 years, not a single trace or thought of a roach, i knew no one with roach problems. Then all of a sudden they move in and roaches are fucking EVERYWHERE. i spent so many hours cleaning, baiting for roaches and spending more money, yet there are even MORE roaches. I sealed up all food, cat/dog food, any traces of things roaches can eat, but they are taking over my life. They crawl over me as i sleep, they bug my sweet cats, i now cant make coffee at home cause even making a fresh pot results in roaches popping out in the fresh brewed pot from them nesting in my coffee machine.

The in laws do nothing to help this, I stressed them to help pay for things to kill roaches, they do nothing yet have a bunny that shits everywhere and a pet rat, on top of 2 poor dogs they take shitty care of.

TLDR, i want to put a bullet in my head over them moving out

I have EPI, celiac, and gastroparesis (amongst other things). Since January I've been having loose stools like 3+ times a day. I eat completely gluten free, very low fat, and easy to digest foods (I'm mostly GF vegan). I have stopped drinking coffee. I recently tried not eating any solids and just drinking Owyn nutritional shakes (vegan, GF) for every meal. I do take Creon with every meal/snack. I started adding macrobars for lunch (vegan GF protein bars) and felt okay with that, but still the awful poops continue. I'm stuck waiting for my gastro appt in June and they didn't give me any ideas of what to do until then. 

I (39F) currently am a single mom of 2 and am in school full time as well as working as a house cleaner under the table. I have to time my cleanings around eating and often skip meals before work so I can go the 4 hours without needing a bathroom. If I'm super weak and need to eat, I'll take Zofran and Imodium to make it through a cleaning. I know both of those aren't ideal. 

I guess what I want to know is if this is just my ""new normal"". Is this the typical life of someone with Celiac, EPI, and gastroparesis? To not be able to eat food without having diarrhea or feeling sick all the time... To rely on nutritional shakes and medicine to not poop my pants at work? This sure is shitty (pun intended)

If so, I'm guessing my life expectency isn't going to be so great and I should probably figure out a plan for the kids. üòÖ",1,1747622581.0,Gastroparesis,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt care about changing initials because I truly hope you see this, even though I know you won‚Äôt. There is so much I wish I could tell you, I wouldn‚Äôt even know where to start. How could I tell you what I feel for you? I don‚Äôt even think we‚Äôve been in a room alone for more than five minutes. I don‚Äôt know your favorite color. I don‚Äôt know what scares you, i don‚Äôt know your favorite food, who you talk to the most, I don‚Äôt know anything about you, still, I feel like I know you inside out. 

I see you. You see me. I know you do. I can feel it, and I always could. You have the kindest eyes I have ever seen. You have a smile that makes me want to stare at your face forever and smile right back. I genuinely do not understand how you aren‚Äôt chased by fifteen different women at all times. You are the safest man I know of, and, again - I barely know you! I don‚Äôt know you, but I feel like we have known each other forever. I don‚Äôt know you, but I truly know you are a good person. When I was twelve, I used to scroll online, read romantic quotes, make up stupid scenarios about me and my stupid crushes. I do the same to you. If only you knew how many nights I‚Äôve been wanting nothing more than to lay in your arms. We wouldn‚Äôt have to talk. Our eyes would communicate in their own language. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd ever dare to kiss me. Still, we would end up kissing - I‚Äôd cross my own fears to make up for all the lost time, it‚Äôs only fair. One of the many things I read online as a twelve year old was ‚ÄúWhatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same‚Äù. Cheesy as hell (not in the context of the book, of course!), and also exactly how I feel about us. We are the same. It terrifies me. You make me feel like I‚Äôm twelve again.

I don‚Äôt know how you feel about me. Recently I‚Äôve been wondering whether you‚Äôre trying to signal something. You do not understand what your love would mean to me and I did not sleep a minute last night. The idea that you could be longing for me, even just a little, brought me perhaps the most joy I‚Äôve felt so far in my short 20 years. Maybe I‚Äôm not completely delusional, maybe you too see how we just might be perfect for each other. At the same time, my heart aches. We don‚Äôt have the time to find out. It‚Äôs my fault, again. 

I wish you knew how I felt without me having to tell you. I want you to know how beautiful you are. You are so stunning. How I have never wanted anyone in the way I want you. How I have never genuinely enjoyed the presence of a person as much as yours. How reassuring it was to have you there, more reassuring than the person that should‚Äôve been my comfort. I wish I could tell you how I was longing for you before I got with him. I wish I could tell you how complicated the foundations of me and his relationship was. I wish I could explain to you why I stayed for so long, although I don‚Äôt think even I know the complete answer to that. What I do know is that it was a pathetic choice, one that I will regret probably for as long as I breathe. While it lasted, I thought I could shut our connection off. When that didn‚Äôt work, I tried to redirect it. Twist it and shape it into whatever I could which did not involve me in dishonesty. That worked for a while. And when it didn‚Äôt, I shut down. I couldn‚Äôt really escape you - not in my thoughts, not in my heart, not in your apartment. I felt so ashamed, which was well-deserved. I am not trying to justify that. 

You asked me if I missed the city after Christmas break. I told you I did not. Last Christmas, I went home with the intention of making up my mind about leaving him. But really, I had already made up my mind. The possibility of getting together with you was never a factor in that - I thought it impossible after the choice I made two years ago. I would not want to hurt him (even though he has hurt me), and I know you wouldn‚Äôt either. I told my friend that I think I like you because you‚Äôre the type of person who wouldn‚Äôt get with his friend‚Äôs ex girlfriend. Ironic, right? I just could not bear the guilt. My mind was made up, yet I knew I could not be completely honest with him. That would have served no purpose, it would have made him resent you, it would have made me hate myself. 

Now, I‚Äôm not saying me and him ended purely because of my feelings for you, far from it. Our relationship was full of holes. Of broken trust, different values and a lack of genuine attraction, I believe. He would give you some entirely different answer if you asked. I wonder if you ever asked. I doubt it. I loved him, but I did not like him. Sometimes I think he got with me to prove to himself that he could. I didn‚Äôt think he could. I didn‚Äôt want him to, not in the beginning. He never really gave me an option. I wish I could explain it all to you. I think you think that he broke up with me. And he did, kind of, though I was going to end it either way. I don‚Äôt think he is mature enough to truly love anyone just yet, not in a romantic sense- maybe I‚Äôm just a bit bitter, I don‚Äôt know. I think I was trying to fix him in that sense, just as I tried to fix many of his other problems. I know that was never my job. I am quite the devout lover, whether romantic or platonic, that much I know, and it unfortunately led me to tolerate things I should not have. I did not respect myself enough at the time to realize many of these things. I tried to forgive him for the things he had done, and I really, truly wanted to. But I ultimately could not. 

I do think you feel something for me. I don‚Äôt know exactly what, how much, or since when. But I hope I am interpreting the signals right, even if they weren‚Äôt intentionally put there for me to interpret. They probably weren‚Äôt. If they were, you would‚Äôve reached out more often, I tell myself. I‚Äôve thought about asking you to meet me for coffee, just as friends, just before I leave this city for good. But I don‚Äôt know what the point would be. I would enjoy your presence, I think you would enjoy mine, and we would have a couple of hours just to ourselves, for the very first time. Then I would go home and my heart would be even more full of love and admiration. Maybe the same would happen to you, maybe the opposite would, I do not know. Still, it would not change anything. If we mentioned everything that‚Äôs been under the surface, there would be no going back from that, and still I would be leaving. My own choice hurts more than I can put into words. I considered staying, only to realize it would mostly be for you - for an unlikely, complicated, maybe-possibly-there-chance of you: I can‚Äôt do that to myself, as I would likely break my own heart. This way, it‚Äôs not broken. It‚Äôs just reserved for you for some time, just in case you would end up where I do. I like to think that we‚Äôll meet again under different circumstances in a few years. Not too many, that I could not bear. I hope to get lucky enough to meet you again, this time not as someone‚Äôs something, just as my own person. 
I hope you‚Äôll be single, and if not, it‚Äôs karma, only fair, though I do not know how I would cope. I hope you have not had feelings for me all this time. I don‚Äôt want to have been one who hurts you, although unintentionally. If I have, I am really, truly sorry. 

I have learned a lot of things these past two years. And I have decided that I will never enter a relationship with someone I don‚Äôt like as much as I like you. You set my new, much-needed standard.  I know how irrational it is to say that I love you. Still, you‚Äôve carved yourself deep into my heart in ways I did not expect, and calling it anything other than love feels laughable to me. I love everything I know about you. I need to find out more about you; either to disprove the feelings of my heart, or to open it to you in its entirety. I really, really hope we meet again. Dear GOD I hope we meet again. 


- your friend (I hope you still consider me that), A :‚Äô)

Sounds familiar, right? 

Enter the magic of **AI voiceovers and automation**! üé§‚ú® Imagine a world where you can pump out awesome content without breaking a sweat‚Äîor, let‚Äôs be real, putting your face on camera!

Here‚Äôs a little behind-the-scenes nugget: I used to spend hours drafting scripts, recording, and then editing like a maniac just to get a 2-minute video up. But now? My secret weapon is AI, and it‚Äôs been a total game-changer. 

Here‚Äôs how to harness that faceless power:

1. **Voiceovers Made Easy**: AI voice generators are here to save the day‚Äîseriously! Tools like Descript or Speechelo can turn your written content into polished audio. Why stress over your vocal range or accent when AI can sound pro-level at the click of a button?

2. **Automate Your Workflow**: Think ‚Äúwork smarter, not harder.‚Äù Use tools like Zapier or Integromat to automate your posting schedule or even to share your content on social media. Imagine sipping coffee while your content goes viral on autopilot! ‚òïüöÄ

3. **Repurposing Gold**: Take that epic blog post you spent days writing and turn it into a podcast or video. With AI voiceovers, you can record an audio version in under an hour. Now that‚Äôs what I call a content-generating powerhouse!

4. **Create a Faceless Brand**: Listen, you don‚Äôt have to be the face of your brand. Instead, craft a personality through your content. Let your AI voice do the talking while you focus on what you do best‚Äîcoming up with ideas and strategies. 

5. **Data-Driven Decisions**: AI can analyze what type of content performs best for your audience. No more guessing games! Get insights from analytics tools to create what your followers really want. 

So, what‚Äôs stopping you from diving into this world? Fear of the unknown? I feel you! But think of all the time you‚Äôll save to do‚Ä¶ well, anything else you enjoy! 

And let‚Äôs be real‚Äîimagine telling your friends about how you automated your way to content wizardry, sipping that fancy drink you didn‚Äôt have time for before. üçπ Who wouldn‚Äôt want to be the go-to resource for productivity hacks?

Honestly, it‚Äôs a game of leveraging what‚Äôs out there. AI is here to help, not to make you obsolete. If anything, it‚Äôs about elevating what you can do while keeping that extra hour (or three!) for life, laughing, and maybe even some binge-watching. Who truly wants to work harder when you can work **smarter**?

**General Notes**

-We got immensely lucky with the weather, stayed between 65-75 the entire time. Coming from TX as it's in the 90s was a luxury.

-The spring blooming right now in mid May was incredible. The entire city felt lush and alive with color.

-We ended up not taking a car anywhere but to and from the airport. The bike system Portland has is great with stalls nearly everywhere. As well the drivers were all so incredibly nice to cyclists, I always felt safe due to the infrastructure and people

-Every local we ran into was a kind and welcoming. Had a lot of great conversations with people about town.

-Where is everyone? I felt like we regularly were the only people hanging around town? Most mornings felt like the opening scene to 28 Days Later. Even in more dense popular areas, things felt a little empty, better than overcrowded though. As well traffic was almost non-existent. 

-When we travel we like to try a lot of food. 

-Note sure if this post belongs in r/askportland, feel free to shoo me over there if so.

* Thursday
 * Land at PDX pretty late grabbed a drink and some bread at **Someday** (incredible candle lit vibes and an almost vacant bar) then went straight to bed.

*  Friday
 * Woke up and walked over to **Fried Egg I'm In Love** (quintessential greasy egg sammie experience, had fun decoding all the puns on the menu. The hash brown bite felt like an elevated McD's hash. Delicious, gave me horrible breath). 
 * Hoped on Biketown bikes and went all the way to **Washington Park** and putzed around the test **rose garden**, then hopped on the loop bus to the vet memorial to hit the trails. Went through the **redwood trail** and made our way to the Japanese Garden via Wildwood. Incredible hike, and 80% downhill thanks to the shuttle. The redwood deck lookout was notable.
 * Hoped on bikes and went to **Powell's main location**, been here before, always a treat. Bought like 5 books, whoops. Used prices are actually really good.
 * Cross the water and went to **Champagne Poetry** for a treat (had the jiggly pancakes, the novelty was worth it, they really do jiggle. There's probably 'better' pastry spots in town, but this was really fun)
 * Hung out at the AirBnb again then hopped on bikes and went over to **Ken's Artisan Pizza** (I'm a big fan of Ken Forkish so coming here was sort of a pilgrimage. Made sure to get there at 4pm for 5pm open and holy cow y'all were not joking about the line, it wrapped around the block. Luckily we were 2nd, met a friendly local author and his family in line and made the hour breeze by. Pizza was incredible as expected, big nod to the mortadella pizza) Then made our way downtown for a show at **Arlene Schnitzer**  (beautiful venue that was well set up). 
 * Left the venue and onto **Voysey** (great 'speakeasy' bar, drinks were solid and decor was fun to end the night at. Also the playlist was top notch, I was constantly pulling out my phone to get a song title). Went back to AirBnb to crash.

* Saturday
 * Got up and walked over to **Tabor Bread**  (loved the lox bagel I got and the other treats on offer. The neighborhood obviously loves this spot cause there's a line out the door). Then walked a block over to **Kind Coffee** (delicious coffee and probably the best cannoli I'll have of my life. Also the person running the cart was a riot). 
 * We were debating going to hike around Tabor but decided we'd make today a shopping day. Walked up and down Hawthorne and hit a few boutiques, **The Perfume House**  was a fun surprise to stumble into. 
 * We wanted to try **Jinju Patisserie** but it was closing soon. Hopped on bikes and raced over. Don't recommend going 30 min. before close as most everything was picked over, but the tarts we got were delicious nonetheless. 
 * Walked up and down Mississippi St and window shopped, **Paxton Gate**'s selection of oddities was awesome. Grabbed a drink and some fries at **Victoria Bar** (could spend an afternoon here, the parm fries were awesome).
 * Got on bikes again and went to **Broadway Books** (lovely bookstore with a good kids section. The shopkeeps were really helpful and fun. Then went onto **Wedgehead** (legendary pinball bar, only could spend an hour but holy hell this place is my dream. Recommend for anyone remotely interested in a good time. Then wristband / unlimited play at their machines was a lot of fun with some strong cocktails)
 * Biked all the way over to **Coquine** (5/5 restaurant. Wife and I visited a handful of years ago and we still regularly talked about the meal we had then. It did not disappoint. I'd travel across the country again for a meal here). Then rode the huge hill down in the dark while it drizzled rain, but of us feeling fat-and-happy. Crashed at the Airbnb.

* Sunday
 * Got up and walked over to **Blue Star Donuts** (the buttermilk old fashioned was our favorite, great donuts) and grabbed coffee at **Wallflower Coffee** (friendly staff, groovy decorations, and freakishly hot coffee in a good way).
 * Grabbed a uber to the airport

Because idts this is normal???,"I had went to a cafe with my 3 female friends for a friend's bday after my classes got over and I just got late cause I wasn't able to board the local. Now this woman calls me, asks me in a high pitch tone where I'm to which I politely told her that I'll explain once I reach home.

Once I reach home (I wish I didn't), this woman just started to shout on me. I thought it was because of concern but nah, she had a fight with my dad and took frustration on me as usual.

Everything was okay until she started to shout and say ""itna time kyu lagta hai, friends ke sath hee gayi thi na and bs"" to which I in frustration said ""itna chilla kyu rahi hai? Bol aise rahi hai jaise maine kuch galat karke aaya ho."" 

And then she held this as her weapon. Shouted at me and said ""itna makeup thopkar gayi thi, muh maarne hee gaye hogi kahi toh."" Btw, the makeup I had was just an eyeliner and light lipstick cause I went out with my female friends so ig it's very normal?

I looked at her with shock while she continued to say things like ""friends ke sath hee gayi thi toh itna makeup kyu thopa, pata nahi konse chakkar chala rhi hai."" Bruh, I don't even have a bf üôèüèª

Things get worse when she started to say things with no meaning ""teri aukat hee nahi hai kuch karne ki."" My father had enough and stopped her. She said ""isse neeche ka abhi kuch bolla nahi hai."" And my father got angry and said ""iske neeche bolne bhi nahi dunga."" And then tears started to flow through my eyes. I tried not to cry but it somehow did to the point I wasn't able to breathe. My father said ""don't cry, jaisa bhi hu, tera baap hu aur tere sath hu.""

Now I went in my room, cried, studied, did some shit and slept.
Now I woke up at morning for my class because she strictly said she ain't gonna wake me up. Didn't make my tiffin which is ok. I can't do anything. NOW! She started to shout on me and told me to make food otherwise she won't let me out and I just said ""mai kaise banau abhi? Mujhe class bhi jaana hai."" And lol, she goes like ""Padhai toh teri dikh rahi hai, kitchen ka kaam hee sikh le."" Welp I didn't eat breakfast or anything. On empty stromach with no tiffin but a heavy heart

Now as I moved out, she said ""coffee piya ya nahi."" I said nope. And she muttered ""Pata nahi itne jaldi kya karne jaati hai"" Jaldi? üò≠

Dawg mera class 8 ka rehta, ab 7.30 ko na niklu? Before closing the door I just said ""dusre ladko se milne jaati hu."" And she muttered ""wohi kar sakti hai tu.""

Bhai istg, I'm in local rn, cried my way till the station. How come a mother can be like this?? I remember her telling me how she wishes I get a husband who abuses me emotionally üò≠üò≠

So I wanted to know if real people could be just as accurate! Let‚Äôs see!!

1.	What‚Äôs your favorite way to spend a Saturday? 
ANSWER: Wake up a little later - around 8:45 or so and make a big but healthy breakfast (fruit, yogurt, coffee with protein powder and eggs and toast.) Then spend the morning doing something fun with my kiddos, maybe meet up with some people. Come home and get a quick work out in. Then have a relaxing dinner at home or with friends. The kids are having fun. Then come home and there‚Äôs just enough time to watch a movie with the kids before bed.

	2.	What‚Äôs a trend or phrase you‚Äôve seen lately that makes you roll your eyes? 
ANSWER: I‚Äôve been thinking the middle part is so unflattering! I am and will always be a side part gal!

	3.	If you could go back to any age for just one day, what age would you pick and why?

I recently received my Nomad and am so far loving the experience for note taking and reading books. One thing I would love to be able to do is read my news on eInk. I don't want to be wasting a lot of time each day manually sending PDFs or anything like that, I just want a newspaper experience where I can read a few articles while I drink my morning coffee. News sources I'm interested in are things like Reuters, AP, The Conversation, ABC Australia etc. 

I know about the hack of creating links to various news sites, but again the experience on these sites can be very slow and the scrolling is horrible. I have tried sideloading an RSS reader (Read You) but seem to be mostly getting summary-only feeds with a link to the website, which is then the same experience as above.

Ultimately it would be great to have a native news reading app, but in the meantime has anyone worked out a clean and simple way to read their news on the device?

1kq10fq,https://www.reddit.com/r/IronmanTriathlon/comments/1kq10fq/port_macquarie_703_swim_cancelled_so_i_redid_the/,"Port Macquarie 70.3 Swim cancelled, so I redid the full distance 2 weeks later.","Not sure how broad a scope this subreddit is, but the swim leg of the Port Mac (NSW, Aus) got cancelled just over 2 weeks ago - it's been very rainy here, and sadly a bit too much storm runoff got into the river.

The event went ahead as a duathlon, which I participated in, but in the days following this the cancelled swim was really eating away at me, especially after the extensive training. Decided I'd do the full 70.3 distances locally, Saturday week, exactly 13 days after the original event, meaning not too much time elapses that the fitness wears off, nor is it too close that I'm still in need of more recovery.

Not that this is in any way groundbreaking stuff, but here's how I played it:  
\-I stayed in Port for just shy of a week under the event, which was complete recovery time - no exercise  
\-Got back into light exercise Mon-Thurs the following week, then did a 20 min-shakeout run Friday (day before the 70.3 redo). Got some extra carbs in on the Thurs-Fri too.  
\-Got up at 3am, 3x english muffins with jam and a coffee for brekky  
\-Started the **ride** approx. 4:30am, had an energy gel or carman's muesli bar every 20-30 mins, and had a 1L water and a 500ml electrolyte drink throughout  
\-Started the **swim** approx. 8:20am (swapped ride and swim as ain't nobody swimming open water before sunrise), had half a gatorade and a caffeinated gel before  
\-Started the **run** approx 9:30am, had a banana and half a gatorade before, then had a gel every 4km, plus had a 1.5L camelpack, as well as 2/3 of a pack of Allen's Snakes throughout

Completed it all. Stoked. Ride time comparisons as follows (original 70.3 v redo 70.3):  
\-**Swim**: N/A v 2:21/100m  
\-**Bike**: 27.8km/h v 26.2km/h  
\-**Run**: 5:08/km v 5:39/km  
Impossible to know if this was an accurate reflection of how it would've looked on the day, and I guess we'll never know.

A few pointers of things you may not think of when doing an event like this on your own terms:  
\-**Motivation can be a bit lacking** when people aren't behind you. I got my family and some workmates around it, meaning they checked in, and also made it a lot more difficult to ditch.  
\-Huge huge difference **not having spectators**, volunteers, your own cheer squad, or even other competitors around. They pump you up more than you'd probably realise!  
\-**Lack of ""litter zones""**. I didn't have gels in practice rides or runs, so stashing used wrappers and holding out for a bin in this one was tough.  
\-I definitely take for granted the **closed roads** and (mostly) **cleared footpaths** during actual events, as stopping for cars and people on the footpath was a real bummer.  
\-Way too easy to **take it slower in the transition zones** when you're not in an actual competition.  
\-I usually **sleep badly** the night before an event, and this one was no different, despite it not being a ""real"" event. Clocked just over 4 hours of z's...

All of this to say, I'm stoked I went back and did it, and can now mentally tick off the distance as being done. Hope this was helpful for onlookers.

I own several properties and have a small mortgage. I work from home full time (for the government) and my work is easy. I finish all my tasks in a fraction of the time they're expected to be completed. 

Average day. Wake up at 9am, get a coffee, hop on my computer in my home office. Do some work (easy), have lunch, go to the gym, a bit more work, go for a walk with my family, spend time with my son until he sleeps at 8pm, play video games until 10. Shower, bed, repeat.

The problem is that it's making my anxiety worse. I'm becoming extremely sensitive to my routine and any distribution causes problems. Even going to a birthday party, or being called into the office, will result in a recovery day where I'm bed ridden for 24 hours. 

I went to the office for the first time in 6 months and had to leave early I was getting headaches and dizziness and the next day took off sick. 

It's strange because at 22 I lived in a martial arts dojo. I was walking up at 5:30am everyday to clean, pray. Go to uni, come back and train for 3 hours a day, living off $250/wk. It got so hot at night I slept on an icepack. Living there was hard, but all my anxiety disappeared. Even my death anxiety. I slept so soundly, and remember genuinely being at peace with death, knowing a gave the day everything I had.

Reading my story probably makes you feel some contempt for me and I don't blame you, I live a contemptable life. I believe this contributes to my anxiety, my soul is degrading, I know what I'm doing is wrong, but it's difficult to purposely make your life harder. 

I admire successful people who keep working hard, most of us dream of being wealthy so we can stop working and do whatever we want. Well, I'm not sure that's a good idea for an anxious person. 

My old sensei would tell of his teacher, who trained everyday until the day he died. ""Live hard so you can die fast"". I didn't understand that until I saw my mentor and friend die of pancreatic cancer over 6 years. That's why worse fear, imagine your last 6 years being a permanent existential panic attack, worse than the cancer itself.

When you live a hard life, death becomes a reward, and not in an edgy depressed way. You literally get to rest in peace, as you truly feel you did all you needed to do and don't need to live any longer.

Without disclosing too much information of hers she was in extremely abusive relationships ranging from family members all the way to her childs father who physically and emotionally abused her. Its been consistent her entire life. Shes grown to become very independent which is  awesome and I'm proud of her for that.  I'm a very affectionate man not necessarily just physically but I'll buy her cute little things I see that I think that she would like to put a smile on her face or just that simple little thing I think she would like it. In the 10 months of us being together ive spent about $1000 on different little gifts or things she expresses that she likes which I will go back and get for her etc etc. She expresses frustration that I dont argue with her, frustration about me buying her things because ""I can buy the things I want"" and I'm kind of at a loss at this point. I dont bring up the fact ever that I bought her items (her son's dad would throw it in her face so I simply don't mention it not to mention I do it just because i love her and I truly do just get her small things to make her smile) I don't argue even when she's actually upset I try to comfort her. My last relationship I was with my child's mother for 8 years and she was emotionally abusive so i can understand some of what she has been through. I guess I dont really know what my question is but...some days she's so loving and sweet and affectionate with me but at the drop of a coin she flips and makes me feel like she wants nothing to do with me. Im writing this after an entire day of us laughing and having fun we go our separate ways for the day and then her telling me randomly that she wants nothing from me and that she doesn't need me and can do everything on her own. I will try to tell her that I'm not going anywhere ( she has expressed concern that when she allows someone to get close and they leave the comfort she got from that person leaves with them) and that she can feel safe and be comfortable knowing I'm always going to walk side by side with her helping however I can. Again...I guess I dont really know what my question is beyond me wanting to be there for her and her asking why we're even together. That question being posed after I let her know the things she's asking me to change IE: buying her flowers, her favorite coffee, or little things I see I think she would like, letting her know I'm not going to leave her, reassuring her, telling her I love her. Is all part of who I am and how I show my love. She expresses she wants me to stop doing those things. I'm trying so hard for her and I feel like my efforts 50% of the time are just spit at. I dont want to lose her and I want to continue our relationship but the things she says sometimes are really starting to hurt me and when I let her know that she tells me to get over it. I love her very much and she says the same. How can I show her she's safe and okay loving me? How do I make it known to her I'm not leaving her? 

TLDR: couple loves eachother. Relationships great 80% of the time. Suddenly at random gf tells bf she wants nothing from him anymore. Bf feels like hes fucking up and doesn't know how to help gf with whatever she's going through. ",0,1747621615.0,relationships,0,0.5,False

We've tried moving the couches etc around as much as possible, but everything feels ""off"". 

Mostly what we do is watch movies on the TV, and we get a lot of glare in through the large window, so almost anywhere other than where it is doesnt feel like it works - it feels too utilitarian and/or like a bad use of the space.

I know some of the advice will be based around painting walls and changing light fixtures etc, but at the moment I just want to limit it to layout advice, please =) We dont have a massive budget so would have to save pretty intentionally to paint the walls etc.

We also have about 6 people over once a week for games, so chairs are brought in temporarily to ""host"" and we play on the coffee table (not ideal, but low priority to fix).

We also don't have a dining room, so almost all our meals are eaten in here.

I'm sure a lot of people on here have already heard of this recipe, but I'm talking specifically about Alvin Zhou's absolutely delicious 100 hour brownies (from his video on youtube).

I've made the recipe multiple times at this point, and everyone always goes crazy for the super rich chocolate flavour. I have absolutely 0 notes about the flavour.

However, I'm trying to create a brownie recipe that aligns slightly more with my idea of a perfect brownie. 

I do NOT want a cakey brownie, that is not what I'm saying. But I find that this recipe is acutally slightly too dense for my liking. Too fudge-like. I never thought I would say that.

Does anyone have any tips for small changes I could make to the recipe that would make it less dense? I do still want the chewieness, but not straight fudge.

The only thing I've played around with was the idea of cooling my brown butter until it because almost solid again (but still soft).

Here is the recipe (I always use grams):

INGREDIENTS
2 sticks unsalted butter (225g)
1 tbsp espresso powder (6g)
Coffee ice cube (30g)

4 eggs
1 tbsp vanilla paste (15g)
2 1/4 cups white sugar  (450g)

1/2 cup dutch-processed cocoa powder (45g)
1 tbsp espresso powder  (6g)
1 tbsp kosher salt (9g)

8 oz melted 75% cacao chocolate (225g)
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour (215g)

3.5 oz chopped milk chocolate (100g)
3.5 oz chopped 75% cacao chocolate (100g)
6 oz chopped 75% cacao chocolate, for topping (170g)

Baked in a 9x13 pan.

I ordered them online here in the Philippines and paid P450 (Philippine peso) plus P100 shipping. That's $9.86 (today's rate) for 100 filters. So about 10¬¢ per filter.

Then, a couple weeks ago I saw the seller doubled the price to P964 including shipping. I know for those of you that spend thousands on coffee equipment it's no big deal but $18-20 for 100 small paper discs is outrageous. Especially when my only income is my SSA benefits. 

So, I ordered a set of steel leather punches that included a 40mm and a 35mm (if 40mm ended up slightly too big) for P309 including shipping. Yesterday my wife bought 100 cone filters for P89. I get 4 Neo filters from 1 cone filter. This will yield 400 filters for around P400, or almost 2¬¢ per filter (and decreasing for each additional pack of cone filters).

1kq0mrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1kq0mrb/good_tips_for_losing_weight/,Good tips for losing weight,"Losing weight doesn't require extreme diets or punishing workout regimens. The healthiest, most lasting results come from intelligent lifestyle adjustments rooted in science and self-care. Here's how to reshape your body while actually enjoying the process.

https://preview.redd.it/n8ialdvhgm1f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cd5befc902e7e2fccc8707b6fd49eae3cefa027d



1. Master the 80/20 Nutrition Rule

Researchers at Tufts University found that people who follow the ""flexible dieting"" approach (80% whole foods, 20% treats) maintain weight loss 35% longer than strict dieters.



Try this:

\- Fill half your plate with colorful vegetables at every meal

\- Include protein with each snack (Greek yogurt, hard-boiled eggs)

\- Schedule your favorite treats guilt-free (dark chocolate Fridays, Saturday pizza night)



Chef and nutritionist Ellie Krieger built her career on this principle, creating delicious meals that are 80% nourishing and 20% indulgent.



2. The Power of NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis)

A Mayo Clinic study revealed that people who fidget, stand, and move casually burn up to 350 extra daily calories - equivalent to a 30-pound annual difference!



Sneaky movement boosters:

\- Take walking meetings (like Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey)

\- Do calf raises while brushing teeth

\- Keep a resistance band at your desk



Fitness expert Joan Pagano recommends her clients track steps before worrying about gym time, noting ""the body was designed for all-day movement, not just hour-long workouts.""



3. Sleep Your Way Lean

Stanford sleep scientists discovered that getting 7-9 hours nightly regulates hunger hormones, reducing cravings by up to 45%.



For better sleep:

\- Establish a digital sunset (no screens 90 minutes before bed)

\- Keep your bedroom at 65¬∞F (18¬∞C) - the optimal temperature for fat-burning sleep

\- Try the ""4-7-8"" breathing method to fall asleep faster



Sleep researcher Dr. Sara Mednick found that well-rested people make healthier food choices automatically, without conscious effort.



4. Hydration Before Hunger

A University of Washington study showed that 37% of hunger pangs are actually thirst signals in disguise.



Hydration hacks:

\- Start each morning with 16oz water (like wellness guru Deepak Chopra)

\- Infuse water with citrus or cucumber for flavor

\- Use the ""urine test"" - pale yellow means properly hydrated



Nutrition scientist Dr. Brenda Davy's research proves drinking 2 cups water before meals leads to eating 22% fewer calories naturally.



5. Strength Training Beats Cardio for Fat Loss

Harvard research reveals that while cardio burns calories during exercise, strength training keeps your metabolism elevated for up to 36 hours afterward.



Beginner-friendly strength moves:

\- Bodyweight squats during TV commercials

\- Desk push-ups (hands on sturdy surface)

\- Grocery bag curls (milk jugs work too!)



Physical therapist Dr. Gabrielle Lyon emphasizes, ""Muscle is your metabolic currency - the more you have, the more efficiently your body burns fat.""



6. The 20-Minute Mindful Eating Strategy

A Cornell University food lab study demonstrated that eating slowly reduces calorie intake by 20% while increasing meal satisfaction.



Mindful eating practices:

\- Use chopsticks to slow pace (as chef Ming Tsai often recommends)

\- Chew each bite 15-20 times

\- Put utensils down between bites



Nutritionist Dr. Michelle May created the ""Am I Hungry?"" program showing how mindful eating helps people lose weight without dieting.



7. Spice Up Your Metabolism

Compounds in certain spices can boost calorie burn by up to 8% according to research from Purdue University.



Metabolic spices to try:

\- Cinnamon in morning coffee

\- Turmeric in scrambled eggs

\- Cayenne pepper on popcorn



Chef Marcus Samuelsson frequently uses these spices in his healthy recipes, proving flavor and fitness go hand-in-hand.



The Sustainable Secret

Remember what weight loss specialist Dr. Yoni Freedhoff teaches: ""The best diet is the one you don't realize you're on."" Small, enjoyable changes you can maintain forever beat short-term drastic measures every time.



Your body isn't a problem to solve - it's a living system to nurture. By focusing on consistent, kind habits rather than rapid results, you'll create health that lasts a lifetime.

1kq0ltd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kq0ltd,Four Seasons Las Vegas - Trip Review,"When my wife and I were planning our recent trip to Las Vegas for our 11-year dating anniversary, we knew we wanted a different kind of experience on The Strip. We were looking for a hotel that would allow us to enjoy the energy and excitement of Vegas while also giving us a peaceful retreat when we needed it (we‚Äôre weird late 20 somethings I know lol). There aren‚Äôt many hotels that strike that balance, so we had to choose carefully. I‚Äôm so glad we chose the Four Seasons to act as our home base for this stay from May 13-May 16.

Some of the reviews we found online seemed a bit outdated, and quite a few mentioned the location as being too far from the heart of The Strip. I had some questions going in, but after speaking with Sarah W. Lee, a FSPP travel advisor on this subreddit, I felt reassured. She encouraged me to stick with the Four Seasons and was kind enough to help us secure a few extra amenities, even on the special rate I had originally booked.

The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas is located on the top floors of the Mandalay Bay (floors 35‚Äì39), but it feels like a world of its own. Although it‚Äôs part of a larger gaming resort, the Four Seasons itself is non-gaming, with a private entrance and a separate set of elevators that require a room key for access. From the moment we arrived, the tone of the stay was set. The bellhops warmly welcomed us and asked if it was our first time at the property. We were then walked over to the check-in desk, where Alexandra greeted us with a warm smile, congratulated us on our anniversary, and offered us glasses of sparkling wine along with a delicious mandarin and cardamom refresher that‚Äôs available daily in the lobby. We‚Äôre still thinking about that drink and would‚Äôve gladly taken a gallon of it back to Miami with us. We were also given a lovely box of chocolates as a welcome gift.

The hotel was featuring a seasonal campaign called ‚ÄúArtists in Bloom,‚Äù with vibrant artwork from the Erin Hanson gallery lining the lobby and common spaces. It added a colorful touch of springtime to the elegant setting. Although check-in is normally at 4 PM, the hotel did let us know ahead of time that they‚Äôd try to have a room ready for us by 1 PM when we arrived. Alexandra let us know that we were given an early check-in and were staying in Room 35220. This ended up being a Stadium View room with a beautiful view of Allegiant Stadium and even a partial view up The Strip, a lovely upgrade from the Superior Room we had originally booked, which would‚Äôve had a resort and pool view. That view still would‚Äôve been wonderful, but we were very happy to enjoy the iconic lights and scenery from both sides of the hotel room.

Inside the room, we found a thoughtful welcome treat of chocolate-covered strawberries with ‚ÄúHappy Anniversary!‚Äù written on the plate, along with a handwritten note from Sarah. It was a small but meaningful gesture that made our arrival feel all the more special.

The room itself clearly reflected a recent refresh which blends the classic Four Seasons aesthetic with more contemporary touches. The walls were done in a soft beige wallpaper accented with white wood paneling, while the furniture leaned more modern with light woods and neutral tones. The carpet added some playfulness with a tasteful mix of blues and grays. The headboard was plush and neutral, perfectly framing what is still the most comfortable hotel bed I‚Äôve ever slept in. Compared to the more traditional style of our room at Four Seasons Buenos Aires, this one felt brighter and closer in style to the room my wife stayed in at the Four Seasons Los Angeles at Beverly Hills. I also wanted to mention that the room felt humongous. I believe the website says it was around 550 square feet to be exact.

The coffee station featured a Lavazza machine, which was a nice upgrade from the standard Keurig machine and pods this hotel used in the past (we love strong coffee, as I‚Äôm half Colombian and my wife is Cuban). We were informed that while the mini-fridge is sensor-activated and intended for mini-bar items, guests could request a complimentary personal fridge if needed for medications, leftovers, or water. While we didn‚Äôt need one this time, it was good to know the option was available.

Although we didn‚Äôt dine in at the hotel restaurants during this visit, mainly because we have versions of them back home in Miami, they are still great dining options for guests who want to stay on property. Bourbon Steak is a fantastic option that stands up well against other steakhouses on the strip. We did enjoy a chicken wrap poolside from
Viranda, which was fantastic but expectedly on the costlier side. 

The service throughout our stay was consistently warm and excellent. Every request, whether it was for extra waters, ice, or coffee pods was fulfilled within minutes. The Four Seasons app works really well, as does calling the front desk. What stood out even more were the little details. On our first night, housekeeping noticed our toiletry bags on the counter and placed them neatly on a Four Seasons Las Vegas branded mat. Our chargers, even mine which is hanging on by a thread (you‚Äôll see what I mean) was diligently wrapped up by the housekeeping staff in a Four Seasons Velcro band. Later during our stay, they noticed my wife had brought her sunglasses and left them in the room. They decided to leave a branded lens cleaning cloth beside them the following turndown service. These small, thoughtful touches went above and beyond anything we were expecting. 

The concierge team: Drew, Hallee, and Cheryllynn, were top notch. They managed to secure us a reservation at Golden Steer on the night of our arrival, even though we had reached out only a week and a half before our trip. While we didn‚Äôt take advantage of all the recommendations they gave us, like the Red Rock Canyon Jeep tour, we‚Äôre glad they suggested them and will definitely keep them in mind for next time.

The service extended to the pool deck, where we were offered towels, sunscreen, cold pitchers of water, and refreshing snacks like frozen fruit and cucumber slices with hummus throughout the hour to help beat the heat. Even the paper towel and napkin holders in the poolside restrooms appeared to be wrapped in leather. Again, it‚Äôs the little details that make this property stand out versus the competition. While we didn‚Äôt use the gym during this trip, we did take a quick look and were impressed. It was in great shape and about as nice of a hotel gym as one could hope for without being at a Life Time or Equinox. The citrus-scented towels offered there were a refreshing touch and a nice call back to the eucalyptus-scented towels typically found at those high-end gyms.

While we didn‚Äôt have a chance to use the hotel‚Äôs complimentary house car service this time, we learned about its availability. The service runs from 5 PM to 10 PM on weekdays and from 3 PM to 10 PM on weekends, and can go 3 miles up The Strip. Note that the car service only does drop offs and not pick ups. But, it is very easy to get around using ride share apps or local transit options like the Las Vegas Monorail and the free Tram between Mandalay Bay and New York New York.

Unless we had a very specific reason to stay further north on The Strip, we honestly don‚Äôt feel the need to look anywhere else. The Four Seasons offers exactly what we value in our travels: personalized service with a sense of calm and comfort that‚Äôs rare in a city like Las Vegas. We truly enjoy the Four Seasons style of luxury and hospitality compared to its contemporaries, and this stay only affirmed that appreciation.

By the time we were packing our bags, neither of us wanted to leave. The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas didn‚Äôt just meet our expectations, it honestly surpassed them. It felt less like checking out of a hotel and more like saying goodbye to a place that had started to feel like home. If you‚Äôre on the fence, I definitely encourage you to give this Four Seasons property a shot. From the amazing service to the spacious and comfortable rooms, this hotel is a Four Seasons property through and through. Make sure to book through an FSPP for a bunch of cool perks that will make your stay even more memorable!

Thank you to Four Seasons Las Vegas and to Sarah and her team for making our 11 year dating anniversary, 1 year wedding anniversary, and first time staying in Las Vegas so memorable! The bar has been set quite high for future trips! We can‚Äôt wait to return in the future.",15,1747620587.0,FourSeasonsHotels,2,0.89,False

**Budget:** I would prefer to spend not much money, more looking to cut/switch out stuff if anything. I would be open to spending less than $400 on a new sleeping bag/quilt, though -- the EMS one was purchased in 2014, wasn't that great then, and has not been treated great. tl;dr it kinda sucks

Part One- https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/s/mf8lOj4I8o


As me and my husband slid into bed to hopefully sleep through the raging storm outside, we heard a noise that caught our attention. It was the noise of somebody knocking on the back door. Except this knocking was intense, like something that was desperate or angry. I sat up, but my husband put his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúStay here, Shannon.‚Äù

I sat as he climbed out of bed and pulled on a jacket. He opened the closet to remove a small handgun. He wasn't a hunter, despite the fact that all his buddies were. Rob worked on a farm owned by his friend's parents. His large hands were rough from years of work, his eyes sunken with dark bags beneath them, his shoulders broad and scarred. He was twenty two. 

We met in senior year of high school. I was working at the movie theater when my manager sent me to kick a group of kids out of one of the theaters. They were yelling about something stupid, so I told them to leave. They did, but their friend apologized on his way out the door. This was Rob. He was kind and his smile was sweet. I gave him my number and we started dating soon after. I went to college, and he stayed behind to start working. He showed up every once in a while for the parties, but was waiting for me at home when I graduated. We bought the house earlier this year and I was eagerly awaiting a proposal. 

He looked back to me from the doorway, ‚ÄúIt's probably just a branch or something.‚Äù 

He was gone, swallowed by the shadows of the powerless home. I waited for a moment, only hearing the sound of his footsteps. They stopped and the door opened. I heard talking, but not much. I had enough of waiting, and slid into my slippers. 

I walked up behind Rob and saw a teenage boy, no older than seventeen, sitting on our back patio. The heavy rain splattered across his face. He was barely looking at us as he spoke, ‚ÄúPlease. Somebody broke in‚Ä¶ It's so cold‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do we do, Rob?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúCall the cops.‚Äù

‚ÄúHave you seen that storm, they are definitely preoccupied.‚Äù

He stopped to think for a moment. I looked back to the boy, to see him lying face down. Rob and I rushed out the door and grabbed his arms. We flipped him over. 

Rob put his hands up to the boy's face, ‚ÄúHey, are you okay? Kid, are you okay?‚Äù

The boy opened his mouth, and a little bit of mud came out as he breathed. 

‚ÄúCrap,‚Äù I said as Rob and I pulled the boy through the door. 

Rob pointed down the hall, ‚ÄúGo get a towel or something.‚Äù

I went to a closet in the bathroom and stumbled around in the dark. I managed to find a beach towel and rushed out to the hall. I stepped on a corner of the towel and fell face first into the floor. Pain shot through my face as I pulled myself to my feet. I brought the towel to Rob, who laid it down on the couch before putting the boy on top of it. I grabbed a tissue and shoved it into my nostrils to stop the blood that had begun to drip. 

Rob looked at me and we locked eyes. I knew the look on his face very well by now. He was scared. ‚ÄúWe have to try 911.‚Äù

I pulled my phone out and called, despite the knowledge that they were definitely busy. ‚ÄúNo answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? That can't be right, call again.‚Äù

‚ÄúRob, there is no answer.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt's 911, they can't just not answer.‚Äù

I threw my hands up to indicate that I was clueless. He sighed and looked back down at the unconscious teenager on our couch. I went to the back door and opened it. Gazing into the storm, I tried to see which house he could have come from. The only thing I could see across the small field was something large swinging back and forth from a tree branch. I closed the door and placed my hands on my head. 

I had no clue what to do. I glanced at the coffee table and saw the gun sitting casually. Rob spoke up, ‚ÄúHe's got a nasty bruise on his head.‚Äù

I looked and he was right. It was fresh, and deepening in color as we watched. ‚ÄúHe must've gotten-‚Äù I was interrupted by the sound of the bedroom window shattering. I ran down the hall and into the room to see the rain flying inside through the rectangular hole that was the window. A branch was lying in the frame, but it was at a strange angle. As if somebody had placed-

‚ÄúHoly shit!‚Äù Rob slid into the room, throwing a tarp over the broken window. He locked it in place as best he could. We retreated into the kitchen, where a ding from the coffee machine signaled that the drink was prepared. Rob grabbed the pot and poured a cup. He swung open a cabinet and removed a can of beer, which he proceeded to dump into the mug. 

He emptied the contents into his mouth and slammed it onto the counter. He rubbed his hands through his short hair. He was famously calm under pressure. When a coyote had killed all the farm's chickens, he was called in to clean it up. When the drunken next door neighbor started to shoot at rabbits in the backyard, he went out to calm him down. But right now, he was sleep deprived and upset. 

A roaring screech hit our ears, causing us to jerk our heads to the source. It came from the front yard and was the pitch of a woman. My heart began to race as I realized its proximity to the house. It was at the front door. We opened the door only to find nothing in the dark abyss save for the rain and wind. 

‚ÄúShut the door!‚Äù The boy leapt from the couch and started across the room. Rob raised the gun at the boys, who froze in place. He put his hands up and repeated himself, ‚ÄúPlease shut the door.‚Äù 

His voice cracked as he spoke and his breath was heavy. I pushed the door closed. He sighed with relief and Rob lowered the gun slowly. I met the boy's eyes and saw the intense fear within. 

‚ÄúWhy were you out in the storm?‚Äù Rob questioned. 

‚ÄúI-I-My family. We‚Ä¶ We were attacked.‚Äù

‚ÄúSomebody attacked you?‚Äù I asked. 

A sharp sound erupted into the room and cold shards rained onto the back of my neck. Pain shot through the back of my head as something hard and heavy struck me. I fell into Rob's arms and heard the thud of stone hitting the floor. 

Rob carried me over to the couch and set me down carefully. I rubbed the back of my head. My vision was blurred and my ears were ringing. Rob held up his phone flashlight in front of my face. He turned it on and off. 

‚ÄúShit, she's got a concussion.‚Äù He pointed to the end of the couch, ‚ÄúGrab that pillow.‚Äù

The boy did as he was instructed and Rob placed it behind my head. 

‚ÄúWhat the hell was that?‚Äù I asked as Rob shoved pain meds into my hand. I swallowed them and pointed to the rock lying on the wood floor. The boy was bent over to pick it up. He removed a rubber band from around it and unfolded a wet piece of lined paper. Rob saw this and ripped the paper from the boy's hand. 

‚ÄúWhat does this mean?‚Äù He said, dropping the paper onto the coffee table. He turned to the boy, ‚ÄúDo you know what that shit means?‚Äù

The boy nodded. Rob began walking to the door and peered through the now broken glass. I looked at the paper on the coffee travel and read the words aloud, ‚ÄúLet me in.‚Äù

Rob grabbed the boy by his collar and slammed him against the wall, ‚ÄúWhat does it mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe wants in. Don't let her in.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho? Who wants in?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't know,‚Äù He wheezed, trying to catch his breath. ‚ÄúI don't know what she is. She killed my parents. That's all I know. Please don't let her in.‚Äù He began to sob.

I stood up and immediately fell onto the coffee table, smacking my knee against the corner. The pain of standing was intense, but I pushed through. ‚ÄúRob! Let go of him,‚Äù I shouted. 

He released the boy and backed away. There was a knock on the door. It was soft, barely loud enough to be heard over the raging winds. We all turned our heads to the door. 

‚ÄúDon't do it.‚Äù The boy begged as Rob readied his gun and approached the door. We could see the outline of a figure through the stained glass that remained. The figure was petite with long flowing hair. Rob shined his phone light through the hole in the glass. A soft, pretty face was illuminated by the light. 

She smiled, ‚ÄúI'm so sorry to bother you, but is there any way I could come in for a second. My car broke down outside and I seem to have lost my brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour brother?‚Äù Rob asked. 

‚ÄúYes, he's skinny with dark hair, 16 years old.‚Äù She paused and gasped, ‚ÄúWait. There he is! Come on, get out here. What are you doing there?‚Äù

Rob turned back to look at the boy, who was shaking his head.

‚ÄúIt's cold out here. Come on, let me in,‚Äù Her eyes found mine from across the room. ‚ÄúJust for a sec.‚Äù

Rob looked to me for guidance. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe can't let you in right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come on,‚Äù She laughed with the voice of an LA teen. ‚ÄúI would have thought that rock would have knocked some sense into that stupid bitch.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo. We aren't taking visitors.‚Äù Rob demanded. 

‚ÄúJust give my brother, please.‚Äù She made a dramatic frown and blinked her eyes. Rob was staring at her in silence for a moment before turning to me. ‚ÄúWe have to give him to her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù The boy shouted. 

I tried to reason with him, ‚ÄúRob, what are you talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe gave you a concussion, who knows what else she's gonna do to us if we don't give her the kid.‚Äù

The boy stepped forward, ‚ÄúI'm not going out there.‚Äù

I placed my hand on Rob's chest, ‚ÄúHoney, we can't do that. She's dangerous, we don't know what she'll do to him.‚Äù

‚ÄúI'm not worried about him, I'm worried about us.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe's just a kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you're my wife.‚Äù He turned around and grabbed the boy by the arm. 

‚ÄúStop it!‚Äù I screamed, but Rob continued towards the front door. 

The boy grabbed at the wall and attempted to pull away but it was no use. Rob was too strong. 

The girl on the porch smiled, ‚ÄúI knew the big guy would understand.‚Äù

Rob grabbed the door handle, but I stepped in front of him. ‚ÄúRob, stop it!‚Äù

‚ÄúShannon, you know that this thing isn't human. She's asking to let in. She is a goddamn vampire, sweetie.  We have to give her what she wants so that she won't hurt us. We need to think about our future.‚Äù

He pushed me out of the way with his elbow and opened the door. I looked around the room. I dug my hand into his pocket and pulled out his gun. He shoved the boy out onto the porch and the girl in the raincoat grabbed him with glee. 

It fired the gun into her eye, sending her stumbling off the porch and into the flower bed. Rob grabbed my arm and I swung the gun around to smack him in the nose. I heard a loud crack and he grasped his face. The boy jumped across the threshold back into the house. 

Rob screamed out, ‚ÄúJust come in here and get him!‚Äù

The girl jolted upright, her eyes fixed on the boy. I dragged him behind me as I ran through the house. I looked back for a second to see the yellow raincoat sliding across the ceiling. I reached the garage door and we ran in, slamming the door closed behind us. 

I could hear Rob shouting from the other side as I started the car. The boy pulled himself into the passenger seat after grabbing an axe from the corner.  Rob hollering turned into terrible screams as I hit the button and the garage screeched open. The door was agonizingly slow and I knew that the vampire wouldn't be distracted for long. As soon as there was enough room, I slammed on the gas and sped down the driveway. 

‚ÄúI'm sorry,‚Äù The boy whispered.

She was a silhouette of elegance against the vibrant autumn foliage, her heels clicking on the cobblestone path as she made her way to the art gallery where she was set to curate an exhibition. The campus was alive with the chatter of students, the hum of lectures, and the distant melody of a guitar from a nearby bench. Xandra's presence was a beacon of calm amidst the chaos, her eyes reflecting the deep, unspoken depths of her thoughts.

  
As she entered the gallery, the cool, dimly lit interior was a stark contrast to the warm, bustling campus. The air was filled with the faint scent of oil paint and the soft hum of a nearby exhibit. Nicole, her best friend and confidant, was already there, her vibrant laughter echoing through the space. Nicole was a whirlwind of energy, her sharp tongue and magnetic personality making her a force to be reckoned with. She was Xandra's mirror, her anchor, and her sanctuary of laughter and truth. Nicole's eyes sparkled as she spotted Xandra, her smile widening. ""Xandra, you're here! I've been dying to talk to you about this new artist I found,"" she said, her voice filled with excitement. Xandra smiled, her eyes reflecting the warmth of their shared history. ""I'm all ears, Nicole,"" she replied, her voice a soft purr. 

As they began to discuss the artist, the gallery seemed to grow quieter, the air filled with an unspoken tension. It was a tension that Xandra had grown accustomed to, one that she felt every time she caught a glimpse of Neil, the man who was both her forbidden interest and her secret.

  
Neil was a figure of restrained power, his presence leaving no room for anything else. He was a shadow, a mystery, and a temptation that Xandra couldn't resist. Their past was a tangled web of secrets and unspoken words, a history that made him off-limits and yet, inexplicably, drew her to him. As they stood there, the air seemed to grow thicker, the tension between them palpable. Nicole, sensing the shift, looked between them, her eyes narrowing. ""Xandra, are you okay?"" she asked.

  
Nicole's eyes narrowed as she watched Neil, who was standing by the far wall, examining a painting with an intensity that seemed to be more about Xandra than the art. He played it cool, his expression neutral, but his eyes lingered on Xandra just a second too long. Nicole's suspicion grew as she noticed the subtle shift in Xandra's posture, the slight tilt of her head, and the way her fingers played with the pendant around her neck. ""Xandra, what's going on?"" Nicole asked, her voice low and concerned. ""Is there something you're not telling me about Neil?"" Xandra's eyes met Nicole's, her gaze steady and unreadable. ""Nothing I can't handle, Nicole,"" she replied, her voice barely above a whisper. 

Nicole's brow furrowed, her loyalty warring with her curiosity. ""I just want to make sure you're okay, Xandra. You know I'm here for you, no matter what."" Xandra smiled, her eyes softening. ""I know, Nicole. That's what makes our friendship so special."" As they spoke, Neil turned, his gaze meeting theirs. The tension in the room thickened, the air charged with an unspoken electricity. Neil's eyes lingered on Xandra, a silent conversation passing between them, one that Nicole couldn't quite decipher. The gallery seemed to hold its breath, the silence stretching as the three of them stood there, each lost in their own thoughts, each aware of the delicate balance they were walking on.

  
Nicole, sensing the undercurrent of tension, decided to give Xandra and Neil some space. ""Alright, you two, I'm going to grab a coffee. You two look like you need to... finish organizing,"" she said, her voice laced with a playful hint. Xandra nodded, her eyes never leaving Neil's. As Nicole left, the gallery seemed to grow quieter, the air thick with anticipation. Neil turned to Xandra, his eyes reflecting the dim light of the gallery. ""Xandra,"" he began, his voice a low rumble, ""I can't pretend anymore."" He took a step closer, his hand reaching out to cup her cheek. Xandra's breath hitched, her heart pounding in her chest. She leaned into his touch, her eyes fluttering closed. ""Neil,"" she whispered, her voice barely audible. ""We can't."" His thumb brushed her bottom lip, sending a shiver down her spine. ""I know,"" he replied, his voice heavy with desire. ""But I can't help it. I never stopped wanting you."" His lips brushed against hers, a soft, tentative kiss that sent a wave of heat coursing through her veins. 

Xandra's hands found their way to his chest, her fingers tracing the hard muscles beneath his shirt. She could feel his heart racing, matching her own. His hands moved to her waist, pulling her closer, their bodies pressing together. The kiss deepened, their breaths mingling, their hearts pounding in sync. It was a dance of desire, a tease of what could be, a promise of more. Xandra pulled away, her eyes filled with a mix of longing and fear. ""Neil,"" she whispered, her voice hoarse. ""We can't. Not here. Not now."" He nodded, his fingers brushing her hair away from her face. ""I know,"" he replied, his voice filled with a quiet resolve. ""But I won't stop wanting you, Xandra. I can't.""

I think it was my house being messy from the weekend, all the kids wanting different things all at once, laundry piled up, dishes piled up, house a mess. I sat down on my front porch this morning to try and have some quiet time and drink my coffee. And I just sat there, looking at my daffodils. The flowers have been long gone, for a few weeks now, and the leaves were just wild and flopped over and so messy looking. So I decided to cut them. And I cut them all right. It was so satisfying in the moment. I looked at my garden and thought it looked so much better. Now that it‚Äôs the evening and I‚Äôm looking at it not so overwhelmed and stressed out anymore, I realize I‚Äôve made a big mistake. I shouldn‚Äôt have cut them.

I'm looking to sell my modded Gaggia Classic (120v) as I have moved to a Mechanika Max. I am listing as a **local only** sale for now as I don't want to deal with shipping, but if it doesn't sell for a while I'll reconsider shipping. I am asking for **$500** by Venmo, Paypal, or cash.

Image gallery of the machine, included parts: https://imgur.com/a/jb6O52A

Includes videos of the standard pump action as well as the dimmer mod, and steam action.
More images and videos are available upon request.

It comes installed with:

* PID (Pre-2018 Kit from Shades of Coffee)
* DIY dimmer switch mod for flow control
* Rancilio Silvia (V1/V2) Steam Wand
* Slim drip tray and long vent tube (from Shades of Coffee)
* Stainless steel dispersion plate (from Shades of Coffee)
* IMS Precision shower screen GA200IM
* Cafelat silicone gasket 8.5mm (blue)
* Insulated boiler using a high heat silicone mat (https://a.co/d/9q27Iu7), self cut DIY project

The OPV has been adjusted for 9 bars of pressure at the group head.

Note that all mods performed are 100% reversible to stock, with the exception of the Rancilio steam wand replacement but only because I had to destroy the original steam wand to get the locking nut. If you buy a new Gaggia steam wand, the wand can be swapped back. I am selling the machine as is in its modded state.

History:

* I purchased this locally used in March 2021 in great condition.
* Model and date of manufacturing is not clear as part of the identifying sticker has been torn off and I only have the serial number left as reference. But it's definitely a pre-2009 model (maybe late 90's?), using the hex-key adjustable OPV (not springs).
* Maintained with regular water backflushes, Cafiza backflushes every couple weeks, and boiler descaled twice a year using the Durgol special descaler.
* Only ever used custom brew water. 60ppm hardness from magnesium, and 20-90ppm buffer with sodium bicarbonate depending on what I was brewing.
* Freshly descaled and backflushed with Cafiza before I removed it from my countertop and into storage (ready to sell).

Additional accessories and parts that will come with it:

From left to right, top to bottom. https://imgur.com/kinmeaD

* 10 piece upgraded service kit -gaskets & o-rings (https://www.shadesofcoffee.co.uk/parts-and-accessories/gaggia-classic---10-piece-upgraded-service-kit--gaskets-o-rings). Purchased this as part of an order but I have not used any of the parts yet, just have them around as backup.
* Metal backflush disc
* DIY pressure gauge and adapter. You can screw this on the threads of the Gaggia spouted portafilter to have your own at-the-group pressure gauge. This is what I used to calibrate the OPV to 9 bars at the group head.
* Random unmarked metal tamper that came with the machine. Appears to be 58mm.
* Brass dispersion plate, six hole variant
* Original shower screen, group head, and rubber gasket.
* Stock portafilter basket, and the stock pod compatible basket
* Original Drip tray and vent tube
* Spare parts from the Shades of Coffee PID kit.
* Rancilio steam wand securing nut (have to use the original nut that comes with the GC to fit the Rancilio want)
* Original Gaggia spouted portafilter with shot splitter.
* Gaggia bottomless portafilter, purchased from Whole Latte Love
* One full container of Durgol special descaler
* Upon sale, I will also send the Shades of Coffee PID kit installation instruction manual (PDF).",2,1747619451.0,coffeeswap,1,1.0,False

Last March, a blower-door fan the size of an airplane propeller whirred in my front doorway while the energy-advisor‚Äôs laptop plotted an ugly red curve‚Äîair changes racing far above Ontario‚Äôs new 2025 target. Translation: if I couldn‚Äôt squash those leaks, my basement-suite permit and the sweet energy rebate that came with it would both vanish. Two months and several hundred feet of tape later, I booked a retest and watched the curve drop into the green zone. I‚Äôm sharing the exact prep routine that rescued me, distilled into a step-by-step checklist so you can dodge the sweaty-palmed moment I had.

*(Reference for the new code requirement: City of Kingston summary of 2024 OBC amendments, effective Jan 1 2025 ‚Äî* [*https://www.cityofkingston.ca/building-and-renovating/building-permits/2024-ontario-building-code-updates/*]()*)*

# 2 ‚ñ∏ The rule you‚Äôre up against (and why inspectors suddenly care)

The 2025 Ontario Building Code enforces a **mandatory whole-house airtightness test**‚Äîcommonly measured as ‚Äúair changes per hour at 50 pascals‚Äù (ACH @ 50). While older SB-12 paths merely listed prescriptive insulation values, the update adds a quantified leak-limit that builders and retrofitters must prove with a blower-door report filed by an NRCan-registered energy advisor. Fail the number, fail occupancy.

* **Who needs the test?** New builds, additions that trigger energy modelling, secondary-suite conversions, and deep retrofits claiming provincial rebates.
* **Who runs it?** Third-party advisors‚Äîfind one via Natural Resources Canada directory: [https://oee.rncan.gc.ca/register-now]().
* **When is it run?** Once the air barrier is ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù but before finishes conceal critical layers.

*(More background: HRAI bulletin on airtightness testing obligations ‚Äî* [*https://www.hrai.ca/news/ontario-building-code-air-tightness*]()*)*

# 3 ‚ñ∏ Big-picture strategy‚Äîthink of tightness like prep for a marathon, not a pop quiz

**Key insight:** Air sealing costs peanuts during framing and exponentially more once drywall is up. So the DIY prep below starts **months** before fan day:

1. **Design** ‚Üí Choose continuous air-barrier approach (interior poly, exterior sheathing tape, or hybrid).
2. **Mock test** ‚Üí Run a ‚Äúblower-door rough-in‚Äù before insulation to find gaping holes while they‚Äôre visible.
3. **Detailing** ‚Üí Seal small penetrations as they appear‚Äîdon‚Äôt pencil them on a ‚Äúlater‚Äù list.
4. **Final pass** ‚Üí 24 hours pre-test, walk the house with smoke puffer and tape in hand.

# 4 ‚ñ∏ DIY blower-door prep checklist (field-tested in a 1970s split-level)

# A. Tools & materials

|Item|Why you need it|
|:-|:-|
|Acrylic caulk + sausage gun|Flexible, paintable, rated for air-seal joints under 6 mm|
|High-performance tape (SIGA, 3M 8067, or similar)|Bonds to cold sheathing; stays stuck when blower-door ramps to pressure|
|Spray-foam cans + extender straws|Fill large plumbing & wiring gaps; look for low-expansion to avoid bowing frames|
|Peel-and-stick flashing strips|Bridge transitions (window buck to sheathing)|
|Smoke puffer or incense stick|Visualize drafts during DIY depressurization (use range-hood or old bathroom fan)|
|Headlamp & kneepads|You‚Äôll be crawling rim-joists at 11 p.m.|

*(Product selection guide: Building Knowledge Canada air-sealing field notes ‚Äî* [*https://www.buildingknowledge.ca/air-tightness-testing/*]()*)*

# B. The seven leak zones that sank my first test

|Zone|Typical leaks|DIY fix|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**1. Attic hatch & pot-light cans**|Warped hatch panel, unsealed IC cans|Weatherstrip hatch perimeter; swap cans for sealed LED wafers|
|**2. Rim joist**|Framing gaps between sill plate & sheathing|Cut rigid foam rectangles, spray-foam perimeter|
|**3. Plumbing stack & bathtub traps**|Oversized holes to basement|Split rubber gaskets + tape overlapping floor membrane|
|**4. Electrical panel & service conduit**|Conduit sleeve unsealed|Brush caulk around conduit, tape to WRB|
|**5. HVAC boots & duct register seams**|Boot/flange gaps|Mastic sealant or UL-181 tape before drywall|
|**6. Window bucks**|Sheathing to buck junction|Peel-and-stick flashing bridging OSB to window, roll tight|
|**7. Sill gasket crush spots**|Inconsistent sill sealant line|Inject acoustical sealant where daylight shows under wall plates|

# C. 48-hour countdown plan

|Time before test|Action|
|:-|:-|
|**48 h**|Walk exterior with foam gun for obvious penetrations: cable, gas, A/C lineset.|
|**36 h**|Inside sweep‚Äîincense stick near top-plate corners; tape leaks you missed.|
|**24 h**|Close fireplace damper, insert balloon if chimney present.|
|**12 h**|Pull HRV core, tape over intake/exhaust grills (advisor will guide if needed).|
|**2 h**|Run range hood & bath fans 5 min to pre-purge moisture, then switch off.|
|**Test time**|Meet advisor, show your sealed HRV & fireplace, hand over floorplan for leakage tracing.|

*(Official NRCan prep guide ‚Äî* [*https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/energy-efficiency/homes/20500*]()*)*

# 5 ‚ñ∏ What happens during the test‚Äîand how to troubleshoot live

1. **Setup**: Advisor inserts fabric door panel with variable-speed fan, plus manometer tubing.
2. **Baseline**: Reads outdoor/indoor pressure difference; unexpected wind gusts can skew results‚Äîschedule calm days if possible.
3. **Depressurize to 50 Pa**: Fan ramps; advisor walks with infrared or smoke to show leaks (free learning!).
4. **Data series**: Multiple flows measured; software computes ACH @ 50.

# Common ‚Äújust-in-time‚Äù saves

* *Window latch not pulled tight* ‚Üí Quick-latch, rerun flow.
* *HRV damper propped open* ‚Üí Tape shut, rerun.
* *Bath fan backdraft damper stuck* ‚Üí Finger-flick, cover with tape square.

If flow drops enough, new reading replaces old‚Äîno retest fee.

# 6 ‚ñ∏ What if you still fail?

* **Get the leakage map** the advisor marks‚Äîmost will log CFM loss by zone.
* **Target big holes first**‚Äîpressure rule of thumb: one tennis-ball-size gap leaks more than 50 pinholes.
* **Book retest quickly**‚Äîtapes and foam cure; momentum fades. Some advisors discount retest if within two weeks.

*(EnerQuality on pass/fail patterns ‚Äî* [*https://www.enerquality.ca/learning/air-tightness-best-practices/*]()*)*

# 7 ‚ñ∏ Beyond code-minimum: why a lower ACH actually feels better

* **Comfort**: fewer drafts mean you can drop thermostat set-point without shivers.
* **IAQ**: controlled ventilation via HRV beats random exfiltration through musty attic insulation.
* **Soundproofing**: my living-room now mutes traffic on Birchmount Road noticeably.
* **Energy bills**: even without quoting dollars, the reduction shows up right away‚Äîfurnace cycles less, shoulder seasons need no heat at all.

# 8 ‚ñ∏ Materials budgeting without violating the ‚Äúno unverified numbers‚Äù rule

Industry research pegs **air sealing as one of the cheapest energy-savings per $**‚Äîoften lower cost than bumping attic R-value. In my retrofit, tapes and caulks ran below the price of a single mid-range window. Your mileage varies; the moral is **buy the good tape**‚Äîcheap housewrap tape peels under fan pressure and you‚Äôll spend more re-sealing.

*(Evaluation of cost-effectiveness: RDH Building Science report on Canadian low-rise envelopes ‚Äî* [*https://rdi.cooke.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/RDH-Air-Sealing-Cost-Effectiveness.pdf*]()*)*

# 9 ‚ñ∏ Where cabinetry sneaks into the story

Sealing rim-joist cavities gets easier *before* you block walls with built-ins. If you‚Äôre planning a kitchen refresh alongside air-sealing, schedule custom boxes **after** the blower-door pass.

Whilst there, the nurse told me I had extremely high blood pressure and I should go to my GP regarding it (measured around 187/87?).

I have since got a home kit that I check three times in the morning and three times in the evening (to get an average). (I've only started properly recording it with this app recently)

Because of my migraines I had already stopped regularly drinking cafinated coffee or tea (I have the occasional fizzy drink) and nicotine (I have 1 cigarette per week if you take an average). I have also started walking around 5 miles every other day to help lose some weight (last I checked, I was 130kg, not great).

Obviously losing weight will tremendously help with my BP, but as of the moment is it something I should be losing sleep over? I have developed (because of some medical issues) quite a big fear over heart attacks and strokes, so some clarity would be useful.

1-Before tanning take a shower with body scrub 2-3x a week a good non-stripping body, cleanser or moisturizing bar, I provided many examples of different types of soaps. Use the Castile soap for a good deep cleanse, a moisturizing bar or a hydrating body wash for hydration and an oil cleanser like l'occitane if you have extremely dry skin

3- the third and most important step is to apply a good sunscreen, as a girl who is Kuwaiti and tans pretty easily I found that there is no difference in your tan when you wear sunscreen you are just protected, and it really helps protect your dark spots from worsen, this is the most important step to protect you now and in the long run, always use sunscreen make sure it‚Äôs good. Make sure you stay protected and don‚Äôt worry about it affecting your tan because it won‚Äôt. try to get one that‚Äôs waterproof. and please please please use lips sunscreen, or a lip balm with spf, it will help you.

Hey everyone! I‚Äôm based in New‚ÄØYork and just got my Amazon‚ÄØFlex approval after only **14‚ÄØdays**. I‚Äôve heard horror stories of 8‚Äë to 10‚Äëmonth waits, so I‚Äôm a little shocked (lucky algorithm roll?).

**What I‚Äôm seeing so far**

* **Block availability:** Mostly 3‚ÄØAM‚ÄØüïí and 6‚ÄØAM‚ÄØüïï starts, paying \$60‚Äë\$80 for 3‚Äì3.5‚ÄØhrs.
* **Up‚Äëfront pay:** Love that I know exactly what I‚Äôll make before I tap ‚Äúaccept.‚Äù
* **Fast & solo:** No food waiting around like DoorDash/Uber‚ÄØEats‚Äîjust grab, scan, drop.
* **Professional vibe:** Thinking of grabbing an Amazon vest or jacket so people don‚Äôt freak when I roll up with packages at dawn.

**My concerns**

1. **No mid‚Äëroute pause?** With DD/UE I could pause for a bathroom or coffee; with Flex it looks like once you start, you‚Äôre committed until the last package is scanned. Is that right?
2. **Commute vs. payout:** Nearest warehouse is \~30‚ÄØmin away. Worth it for an early‚Äëmorning \$60‚Äë\$80 block?
3. **Customer confusion:** Ever get weird looks delivering at 4‚ÄØAM? Any tips to keep it smooth?

**Background**

I‚Äôve done DoorDash and Uber‚ÄØEats for a while but got tired of the ‚Äúhurry up and wait‚Äù for decent orders. Flex feels like a straight lump‚Äësum payday in a predictable window‚Äîexactly what I want‚Äîbut I‚Äôm still green.

**NYC/LI drivers (or anyone):**

* How do you maximize earnings on these early blocks?
* Do you stack Flex with other gigs later in the day?
* Anything you wish you‚Äôd known on your first route?

Appreciate any wisdom‚Äîtrying my first 6‚ÄØAM shift this week! üöêüì¶

1kq02ds,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1kq02ds/rf_a_reflective_journey/,[RF] A Reflective Journey,"The pre-dawn chill bit through his thin work jacket as he trudged along the Calgary pavement. Another day, another shift hauling drywall and breathing dust. He was somewhere between his late twenties and early thirties, a distinction that felt meaningless. Time smeared together in a grey haze of exhaustion and cheap beer. His hands, rough and calloused, clenched in his pockets.

His boots crunched on the sidewalk, the only sound competing with the distant rumble of early traffic. His destination, as it was most mornings for years, was The Roasterie. It wasn't just the coffee, though it was good, strong enough to jolt him into a semblance of alertness. It was her. The barista with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile that seemed, however briefly, to cut through his perpetual gloom. He knew her shifts, her way of tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear, the lilt in her voice when she called out orders. He'd rehearsed countless opening lines in his head, imagined asking her out, but the words always died in his throat, choked by a certainty of rejection. Today, however, wasn't about courage. Today was different.

He pushed open the door, the bell announcing his arrival with a familiar jingle. The rich aroma of roasting beans enveloped him. She was there, wiping down the counter, her back to him. He ordered his usual ‚Äì black, large ‚Äì the words automatic. When she turned, her usual friendly smile flickered. ""Morning! The usual?""

""Yeah. Thanks,"" he mumbled, avoiding her gaze, fumbling with his debit card. He couldn't look at her, not today. Not when the camping gear and the length of sturdy rope were already packed in the back of his beat-up truck. Today, he was driving west, deep into Kananaskis Country, to find a quiet spot among the pines and end things.
The drive out of the city was a blur of familiar highways giving way to the imposing majesty of the Rockies. As the asphalt turned to gravel and the trees grew denser, a memory surfaced, unbidden. He was small, maybe eight or nine, bouncing in the passenger seat of his dad's old Ford. They were heading into the woods, just like this, but for a weekend of fishing and campfire stories. He remembered the smell of pine needles and engine oil, the weight of his dad's hand on his shoulder, the feeling of absolute safety. A sharp pang of loss hit him, so intense it almost made him pull over. That warmth, that security, had vanished when his dad died, replaced by a cold emptiness.

He parked the truck where the logging road became impassable, hoisted his pack, and started walking. He pulled out the roll of reflective tape, tearing off small strips and tying them to branches every fifty metres or so. Just in case, a small voice whispered, though he tried to silence it. Just in case you change your mind.
The forest deepened, swallowing the sounds of the road. The air grew damp and smelled of earth and decaying leaves. As he pushed through a thicket of underbrush, another memory, sharp and unwelcome, flashed behind his eyes. He was maybe twelve. His mom was slumped in her armchair, the television flickering, an empty bottle beside her. A cigarette smouldered between her fingers, dangerously close to dropping onto the threadbare upholstery. The smell of stale booze and smoke filled the small apartment. He remembered carefully plucking the cigarette from her slack hand, dousing it in the sink, the familiar mix of resentment and weary responsibility settling in his young chest as he struggled to guide her stumbling form to bed.

He walked for what felt like hours, finally finding a small clearing near a trickling creek. He set up the small tent, gathered firewood, and coaxed a fire to life as dusk bled through the canopy. He sat on a log, feeding sticks into the flames, watching the sparks spiral upwards towards the darkening sky. Stars began to prick the deep velvet overhead, countless and indifferent. He tilted his head back, truly looking at them. The sheer scale of it, the vast, silent emptiness dotted with distant, burning suns, made his own pain feel suddenly, strangely small. The finality he craved felt less like a release and more like... nothing. A meaningless erasure in the face of cosmic indifference. Doubt, cold and unfamiliar, crept into his thoughts.

Morning arrived damp and grey. He shivered, kicking dirt over the fire's embers. He packed his meagre supplies, the rope feeling heavy and obscene at the bottom of his pack. He turned to head back, scanning the trees for the first glint of reflective tape. Nothing. He walked a few paces in the direction he thought he‚Äôd come from. Still nothing. He checked his pockets. The roll of tape wasn't there. He must have dropped it, or perhaps misplaced the very last marker he'd tied.

Panic began to bubble in his chest. He started moving faster, circling the clearing, his eyes darting frantically between the trees. Every shadow looked like tape; every fallen leaf mimicked its shape. With the rising panic came the echoes of his mother's voice, slurred and angry, from years of drunken nights: ""Useless... just like your father... always a disappointment... never amount to anything..."" Failure. Lost in the woods, just as he was lost in life. The irony was bitter.

He sank to his knees, the damp earth soaking through his jeans. He couldn't find the way back. The forest felt like it was closing in, confirming what he already believed: he was trapped, hopeless. Maybe... maybe this was how it was supposed to be. The forest would take him, one way or another. His original plan seemed less like a choice and more like the only logical path left.
With numb resolve, he pulled the rope from his pack. He found a sturdy branch on a tall pine, tossed the rope over, and tied a crude but effective noose. Tears blurred his vision as he fashioned the knot, the rough fibres scraping against his skin. He looped the other end around his neck, the weight of it settling ominously. He stepped onto a large, moss-covered rock beneath the branch, took a shaky breath, and closed his eyes. The darkness behind his eyelids wasn't complete; for a fleeting, unbidden instant, an image of the barista's smile ‚Äì genuine, warm, the honey colour of her eyes seeing him, truly seeing him, if only for a moment over a coffee cup ‚Äì cut through the despair. Just as he prepared to step off, to surrender to the void, a tiny flicker of light at the very edge of his vision, even through nearly closed lids, made him hesitate. Low down, near the base of a spruce tree fifty feet away, something shone faintly in the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves. He squinted. It wasn't a trick of the light. It was small, rectangular, and unmistakably reflective.

The last piece of tape.

He froze, the rope suddenly feeling incredibly tight around his neck. He hadn't lost it. It was right there. A way out.
Slowly, carefully, he loosened the noose, pulling it over his head. His hands were shaking. He stumbled towards the flicker of light, his heart pounding against his ribs. He reached down and touched the smooth plastic surface of the tape, clinging precariously to a low-hanging twig.
Holding it in his hand, looking from the tape to the noose still dangling from the branch, felt like seeing his life split into two distinct paths. One path led to oblivion, the other... back. Back to the truck, back to Calgary, back to the dust and the exhaustion, but also back to the smell of coffee, the possibility of warmth, the memory of his father's hand, the vastness of the stars.

He took it as a sign. Not a divine one, perhaps, but a sign from circumstance, from chance, from the simple fact that he hadn't lost the marker. He wasn't meant to end it here, alone in the woods.
He untied the noose, coiled the rope, and stuffed it deep into his pack. Following the trail of reflective markers, which now seemed blindingly obvious, he walked out of the forest. The drive back to Calgary felt different. The mountains still loomed, but they felt less like judges and more like silent witnesses.

He didn't know what would happen next. He didn't know if he could fix the broken parts of himself. But as he drove towards the city limits, one clear intention formed in his mind. Tomorrow morning, he would go to The Roasterie. And this time, he would say hello. He would look her in the eye and maybe, just maybe, ask her name.

Open to more if it happens.,"Hey, I‚Äôm 45 and based in Southern California. I‚Äôm looking to meet someone I genuinely click with‚Äîwhether that turns into good conversation, a consistent chat buddy, a travel friend, or who knows. I‚Äôm not chasing romance, but I‚Äôm open if something naturally sparks.

**A bit about me:**

* My brain‚Äôs a strange bookshelf: esoteric ideas, atheism, altruism, and the occasional late-night thought spiral
* Tech nerd. I mess with home servers, privacy tools, home automation, and serve as family tech support
* Lifelong fantasy and sci-fi fan. I like immersive worlds, strong characters, and a good side quest
* I game a bit. Mostly Minecraft with my kid and the occasional solo binge
* Tattoos, storytelling, and art. Haven‚Äôt committed to a full sleeve, but I‚Äôve daydreamed about it
* A mild plant obsession. I haven‚Äôt named them all‚Ä¶ yet
* I read and listen to a lot. Mostly fiction with a side of philosophy
* Politically, I lean left but I‚Äôm happy to talk with anyone who‚Äôs coming from a place of good faith
* Not money-motivated or career-driven, but I‚Äôm responsible, debt-free, and have scary-good credit
* Mentally steady. Anxiety‚Äôs in the background, but I manage it and I‚Äôm not afraid of therapy
* Classic Gen X. Independent, quirky, skeptical of trends, emotionally allergic to groupthink, and fueled by coffee and quiet defiance
* Serious introvert with rare extrovert bursts. I love to travel and would really enjoy finding a travel buddy

**Physical stuff, if it matters:**

I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù, about 190 lbs. Somewhere between a Greek god and Homer Simpson. Bald (well, mostly), so I buzz it short because I refuse to be¬†*that guy*¬†clinging to his last three hairs. I can look a little intense (RBF), but I live in jeans and T-shirts and throw on a hoodie if it dips below 70. I have a septum and two dermals, but they‚Äôre subtle. I think I‚Äôm average; others have said I‚Äôm good looking. You‚Äôre welcome to weigh in. Also, yes, I shower daily and even moisturize. Apparently that needs to be said.

**Where I‚Äôm at connection-wise:**

I‚Äôm really just looking for good conversation and a thoughtful, fun friendship. I‚Äôve got a strong personality and tend to take the lead, so I appreciate people who are grounded and know themselves. If we vibe well and it grows into something more, great. If not, that‚Äôs great too.

I live with my ex. We co-parent and stayed close to ease the transition. If exes¬†*being just friends*¬†makes you uncomfortable, I get it‚Äîbut we‚Äôre probably not a fit, and that‚Äôs okay.

If you‚Äôre someone who values honesty, loyalty, humor, thoughtful conversation, and doesn‚Äôt mind the occasional nerdy movie night or long-winded tangent, say hi.

**Let‚Äôs talk and see what happens. No expectations‚Äîjust looking for something real.**",1,1747618801.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

2 tbsp. vegan butter
¬Ω tsp. salt
‚Öî c. oat milk coffee creamer
2 c. of semi-sweet vegan chocolate chips
1 tsp. vanilla
4 c. vegan marshmallows


Combine first four ingredients in a large metal pot. Combine rest of ingredients in microwave safe bowl.

Coat a glass pan in oil or butter, just a very thin layer using a paper towel.

Stir first four ingredients on medium heat, stirring constantly and scraping the bottom to prevent burning. Bring to a boil for 5 min.

At 4 min 30 sec boil, microwave other ingredients for 30 seconds (may help to have second person do this)

At 5 min boil, dump other microwaved ingredients into the boiling metal pot. Now (very quickly)! stir them all together. The marshmallows and chocolate should melt into a consistent texture in about 30 seconds.

Now pour/scrape into glass pan. Let cool for 30 min, then place in fridge for a few hours. After that you can cut the fudge as it should have firmed up.

Note: you can substitute chocolate chips for mint chocolate for a minty fudge",61,1747618780.0,veganrecipes,1,1.0,False

1kq002c,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1kq002c/i_think_my_dads_new_wife_is_a_narcissist_what_do/,I think my Dad's new wife is a Narcissist. What do I do?,"I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post this, but I'm feeling a little uncertain about how to do deal with my new step mom, who my therapist believes is likely a narcissist.

Long story short(ish), my Dad cheated on my mom and married his mistress after seven years of being together. I'm in my thirties and was pregnant with my first child when the shit hit the fan. It was unexpectedly traumatic. 

My dad has his own narcissitic tendencies and treated our family horrendously in the early days of my parents' divorce. My postpartum depression and anxiety was deeply magnified by the emotional turmoil of the situation. As a result, I opted to set firm boundaries and only have limited interactions with my dad (and avoid his mistress all together). Those boundaries lasted for many years, even while he insisted he wanted me to know her. I felt a deep need to protect my two young children, my husband, and myself.

Last year my dad and his mistress finally got married and he pushed harder for me to know his new wife, indicating that my relationship with him would have to be limited if I did not include her.

Wanting to move through my resentment and pain, I finally agreed to meet her. My husband and I met them and I did my best to graciously outline what I needed in order to have a relationship with them as a couple. I explained my pain and why this was hard and merely asked that those feelings be acknowledged. Instead of meeting me with Grace and understanding, she called me horrible names, said I didn't know pain, and chased my husband and I out of the coffee shop while screaming profanities. It was horrible.

A few months later, my husband and I made a second attempt to smooth things over, thinking maybe it was purely emotion and some time to process what I shared might give her a new perspective. Unfortunately, it went exactly the same way and she was completely unable to acknowledge my pain -- even my dad called her out on not being able to give me that. I didn't even ask for an apology! Instead, she once again called me self righteous, lacking consequences, and a princess. Again, we parted ways with her screaming at us.

Two weeks ago (about a month after this second attempt), my dad texted me saying he wants me in his life, but that she's part of the deal. I kindly told him I've made my effort to make that possible, but my needs were not received kindly. As a result, I need to protect myself and my own family and am not willing to engage with them as a couple, but would allow him to have time with us if he so desired.

Well, fast forward to this week when I find an unexpected card in my mailbox from his wife. Terrified to open it, I fight the fear and find a single sentence: ""I acknowledge that I hurt you."" Nothing else other than her name and a date. No context.

What?!?!?

It felt like such a joke after so much chaos and pain. It felt like a big F you. Yet, there's also a piece of me that wonders if there's any genuineness behind it. My gut says no, but the soft part of me hates assuming the worst. 

I have no clue how to proceed. Do I acknowledge the note? Do I ignore it? Do I go no contact? I deeply desire a relationship with my dad, but I can't handle the emotional turmoil and feeling like my sorrow doesn't matter.

My therapist believes my dad's wife is likely a narcissist with a lot of trauma of her own. I don't have another appointment for two weeks -- the card arrived the day after my most recent session. üò≠ I'm trying to figure out if/how to I respond. Any wisdom is appreciated.

Considering this diversity, I want to include a few types of plants and animals seen during this expedition. There are oxen, foxes, eucalyptus, coffee, maize/corn, wheat and barley, and llamas! (If you haven't figured me out yet, this place is a direct rip of the Andes Mountain region in Peru).

This brings me to the point:

* do you personally call a horse a horse?
* or go out of your way to describe a horse using every description beside the word 'horse'?
* or go through the process of developing all new creatures (even if they have the same purpose and relative anatomy/physiology)?

I have thought about the process of creating a full spectrum of creatures that I would like to feature but feel like it is a lot of upfront cost with less return during the drafting phase.

Last week, my 3 year old daughter told me she wanted to start a garden. I have never gardened a day in my life, and know NOTHING about it, but I said ‚Äúlettuce give it a try!‚Äù (Lol plant pun). I‚Äôm looking for any advice/tips/tricks for growing our plants as best as possible! I am not expecting us to have a bountiful harvest lol, but would like it to be somewhat successful because she has so much fun with it! She loves going to pick the basil leaves and use them when we cook, actively asking me to find recipes with basil in them lol. We also sing to the plants and water them once daily (not sure if either of those are good hahaha). We are all in on the fun of gardening, so now we need to know the actual ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù of it!
Here‚Äôs all the information I can think to provide, and I‚Äôm happy to provide any more that would be relevant:
Climate: We live in South Louisiana, so the climate is very hot and very humid. I‚Äôll list the plants we have below, and include pics. 
Soil: The soil we have says it is for in-ground, because the sweet little man working in the garden section of Lowe‚Äôs gave us that and said it didn‚Äôt make a difference if we used that or potting soil (he was fully aware we were only doing a container garden, as he was the one who picked out all of our pots). That seems weird to me so I did go today and buy some MiracleGro Moisture Control Potting Mix, but I haven‚Äôt used it yet.
Fertilizer: We used a little bit of MiracleGro Tomato Plant Food on all of the plants except the flowers, because once again the man at Lowe‚Äôs told us to. We have also added coffee grounds (used and then baked) and egg shells (washed, dried, put into food processor) on all plants.
Staging(??): My husband built us a little table to lift them up so they wouldn‚Äôt get messed up during thunderstorms and hurricanes (our backyard floods easily). Albert (man at Lowe‚Äôs) said the fence is good for cucumbers because they will ‚Äúsnake up it‚Äù (??) so we have the plants pushed back to the fence.
List of plants I have (from left to right in the picture):
1. Heirloom Straight Eight cucumber (this is the only one we bought seeds for - the rest we bought already planted; there are 4 seeds evenly spaced)
2. Heirloom Black Beauty Zucchini
3. Heirloom Blue Lake Bush Snap Bean
4. Gypsy Mini Bell Pepper
5. Lunchbox Orange Pepper
6. Lunchbox Red Pepper
7. Red Bell Sweet Pepper
8. Hybrid Petunia and ‚ÄúBlue Me Away‚Äù flowers (not asking for help with these bc I know it‚Äôs a vegetable subreddit)
9. Creole Tomato
10. Husky Cherry Red Tomato
11. Super Sweet 100 Cherry Tomato
12. Sweet Basil
13. Basil (not sure the type - my MIL showed up at my house with this and didn‚Äôt know anything about it)
14. Rosemary


Any tips or advice are welcome! I‚Äôm a brand new gardener (as of 10 days ago) so I truly know nothing outside of what Albert at Lowe‚Äôs told me lol. I appreciate any help :)

Thanks!!
