1hzczrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/coworkerstories/comments/1hzczrh/overly_attached_coworker_or_am_being_mean/,Overly Attached Coworker or am being mean ? ,"I (25F) started at this company about two years where I met a coworker (37F) and we share half our clients together so we had to work together frequently. When we first met I was very friendly bc I had no reason not to be (and I knew we’d be working together a lot) and wanted to have a good relationship with her because she was very knowledgeable and helpful. She invited me out to lunch and wanted to get to know me. We shared a few things in common like interest in books, baking, and crafts. She very quickly started wanting to meet together often and work on all our projects together, although it wasn’t necessary. This kind of bothered me at first since she was very pushy about it and I preferred working alone. She started to invite me and other coworkers out to social events. the first time we hung out outside of work, she talked about not having many friends. At dinner she shared that she tried to end her life about 10 months ago, and that she was in an extremely unhappy  marriage. I was kinda surprised she was so open with everyone since we had really just met. I felt very sorry for her. As the night went on she shared more and more details to me about her unhappy marriage and her lack of friendships. After this she became very clingy to me. She wanted to hangout socially every chance she got, she wanted to go on trips with me, she wanted me to meet her kids and insisted I come over to her house to work all the time. I didn’t always say yes bc I’m the kind of person who takes a while to become close with someone. And when we did hangout all she talked about was her husband and his lack of any interest in their marriage. I have a very happy marriage with my husband and she always seemed jealous of it, and made me feel like I could never talk about it with her. She also made weird comments like she was the girl version of my husband. They have some similar interest but she is not like him at all btw. One time while hanging out at a bar I made a simple comment on how me and my husband agreed on the idea of in the future fostering children and she started to cry and said “when I grow up I want to have a relationship like you guys do” this made me really uncomfortable. She also started sending me reels on Instagram stating I’m the most important person in her life and she doesn’t know what she’d do without me. As I got to know her more I realized the more and more we really don’t have in common. We are very different types of people. I didn’t know what to do since she depended on me so much. She shared very very deep and dark secrets with me randomly and I didn’t know what to say. She does see a therapist and I told her to talk to her about these things and she did and her therapist would tell her similar things I did. She also started coming to my house and bringing her kids while we were supposed to be working, which annoyed me bc then I spent the time basically catering to her kids. She would buy me gifts all the time and go extremely out of her way for me, which I felt bad about. There have been a lot of incidents of her doing things like this throughout my time working with her. I honestly felt like she would start stalking me or something. I personally never felt that close to her and felt like she didn’t know me as a person at all. Our difference in age felt very noticeable and I felt like she couldn’t really relate to me and never felt like I could talk about my life bc she’d become upset with her life. I am also not someone who needs to be with my friends all the time like her. I like staying home with my husband bc we are great friends. I recently left this job because of her and she said she spent weeks crying after I told her I was leaving. She said we’d have to meet weekly for coffee dates, mind you I don’t even do this with my closest friends or family! She also said she was terrified of never seeing me again. I feel bad about that because since I quit I haven’t seen her. Am I in the wrong for not wanting to be her friend and feeling uncomfortable? I don’t know how to move forward bc she continues to text me, I don’t always reply and I feel bad about it. Am I terrible for not wanting to be her friend?

Mom (gently): Riley…	Riley…	Riley, time for school

Riley (moaning): Ughhhhhh

*Riley woke up with a boiling head. She wakes up uncharacteristically slow and paced. Mom is used to seeing Riley waking up full of energy.*

Mom: Honey, are you alright? 

Riley (moaning): Ughhhhhh

*Mom places her hand on Riley’s forehead, feeling the heat on her forehead*

Mom: You’re burning up! I’ll get the thermometer

*Mom walks down the hall. Zoom into Mom’s mind*

Mom’s Fear: This can’t be chicken pox!? She’s only 6!

Mom’s Joy: She caught it when she was 3. It only happens once.

Mom’s Disgust: Are we staying or is Bill gonna deal with her?! 

Mom’s Anger: I’ll tell you one thing that’s for sure: I am NOT cleaning up more snot. If she’s gonna make a mess, SHE’S gonna clean it.

Mom’s Sadness: Now where did we put the thermometer?!

*Mom reaches the right bin*

Mom’s Disgust: No! NO! NO! It was in the left bin! 

Mom’s Anger: NO the other left! NEXT to the peptobismol and cough syrup.

*Mom hears Riley cough. She finds the Infrared thermometer and the cough infers her to get the cough syrup, too. Mom rushes back to Riley’s room.*

Mom: Honey?

As Riley sneezes and the pain washes over her, the camera zooms into Headquarters. Inside, everything is in chaos—lights flashing red, the temperature gauge on the wall spiking into the ""Too Hot"" zone.

**Disgust**: (fanning herself dramatically) *WHY?!?? IS??? IT… SO… HOT… IN HERE???*

**Joy**: (wiping her forehead, trying to stay cheerful) Oh, come on. It can’t be that hoo… (pauses as she suddenly feels the heat) Oh boy. Yep. You’re right.

**Disgust**: (sarcastic, gesturing at her dress) What are we going to do, Joy? This dress is *not* made to sweat in. Do you know how long it takes to steam wrinkles out of this?

**Fear**: (panicking as he checks the dials) Oh no, oh no, oh no! We’re completely fried! What if we stay like this forever?!

**Anger**: (marching over to the control panel) Forget it! I’ll FIX the temperature with my *bare hands*! (slams a fist on the console, causing a small spark) There! Problem solved! ... Wait. WHAT THE? Why isn’t it working?!

**Joy**: (stepping in front of Anger, waving her arms) Okay, okay, everyone CALM DOWN! We just need to work together and figure this out.

**Sadness**: (sighing, holding a tissue) What’s the point? Riley feels awful. (sniffles) We should just sit here and let her cry.

**Joy**: (spinning around, exasperated) Sadness! No crying! That’ll only make her feel worse. Remember what happened last time? (points to a memory orb of Riley sobbing after scraping her knee)

**Fear**: (eyes wide) She couldn’t breathe for, like, *five minutes*! We can’t handle that again!

**Disgust**: (rolling her eyes, crossing her arms) Ugh, great, so we’re overheating *and* we have to keep it together? This day just keeps getting better. 

**Joy**: (turning back to the group with a determined smile) Look I know this is new, but we’ve been through worse. Remember her first day of school? (she points to a glowing memory orb of Riley smiling at her desk) We can do this!

**Sadness**: (looking at the orb, perking up slightly) Yeah… I mean, it wasn’t so bad once she made it through lunch.

**Anger**: (grumbling) I still don’t see how eating carrot sticks counts as a victory.

**Disgust**: (shrugs) Well, at least it wasn’t the cafeteria mystery meat.

**Joy**: (clapping her hands, rallying the group) See? We’ve got this! Riley’s sick, but Mom’s here to take care of her. We just have to keep her calm and comfy. Agreed?

(The group exchanges reluctant glances before nodding. Joy steps up to the controls with a small smile, but she hesitates, glancing over her shoulder.)

**Joy**: (nervously) ...Does anyone know how to make being sick fun?

**Sadness**: (gently placing a hand on Joy’s shoulder) Maybe it’s not about making it fun. Maybe we just need to help her get through it.

**Joy**: Alrighty! 

***Zoom out to Riley and Mom.***

*Mom crouches next to Riley, brushing a stray hair from her face.*

***Mom****: Riley, where are you feeling pain?****Riley****: (sniffling heavily) My tummy hurts and my head hurts and… and… Mr. Nose is… (sniffles loudly) soooo stuffy!*

*Mom tries to stifle a chuckle at the nickname “Mr. Nose” and gently presses a tissue into Riley’s hand.*

***Mom****: (calmly) Do you think you’re well enough to go to school? Or maybe… you should just stay home today?*

*Riley’s face lights up faintly, despite her flushed cheeks. Her body sags into the couch in a way that screams “please let me stay.”*

***Zoom into Riley’s mind:***

*Joy bursts into action, bouncing from one end of Headquarters to the other like a firework. She’s holding confetti in her hands, which she throws into the air, spinning and cheering.*

***Joy****: NO SCHOOL!!!!!!!!!! No school! No school! No school! No school! No school!*

*She flips across the room like a gymnast, grabbing the microphone on the console and shouting:*

***Joy****: What do we do first?! I’ve got it! We’ll start by watching TV… then play on Dad’s computer… and THEN… (gasps dramatically) play with Bing Bong in the garden!*

*She pauses for a moment, tapping her chin thoughtfully.*

***Joy****: SCRATCH THAT! Ohhh, even better idea! POOL PARTY WITH BING BONG AND MERMAID UNICORN!!!*

*Disgust looks up from the corner where she’s been halfheartedly flipping through a magazine, raising one eyebrow.*

***Disgust****: (dryly) Because nothing says “being sick” like cannonballing into a pool while coughing up your lungs. Classy, Joy.*

*Fear, meanwhile, is pacing frantically in a circle, clutching his clipboard.*

***Fear****: Wait, wait, wait—what if Dad doesn’t let us do any of that? What if he makes us stay in bed all day with no TV?!*

*Joy skids to a halt in front of Fear, placing her hands on his trembling shoulders.*

***Joy****: (reassuring) Relax, Fear. It’s Dad. He always lets us bend the rules when Mom’s not home. Remember the time we had waffles for dinner?*

*Fear stops pacing, momentarily distracted by the memory.*

***Fear****: (tilting his head) That… was pretty awesome.*

***Anger****: (pounding his fist on the console) And we can FINALLY get rid of the monster! I’m telling you, he’s been creeping out of that closet every night like he owns the place.*

***Disgust****: (wrinkling her nose) Ugh, and he smells like dirty socks dipped in old milk. Someone has to do something about that.*

***Joy****: (brightly) Okay, okay, let’s add that to the list: TV, pool party, waffles, and monster vanquishing. Sound good?*

*The emotions exchange nods, rallying behind Joy’s plan.*

***Zoom back out to Riley’s parents:***

*Mom stands near the door, pulling on her coat as she glances back at Dad, who’s holding a mug of coffee and looking way too relaxed about the day ahead.*

***Mom****: (pointing a finger at him) Okay, I’ve just called the school to let them know Riley’s absent. You sure you can handle her on your own today?*

*Dad flashes a confident grin, leaning against the kitchen counter.*

***Dad****: (casually) We’ll be fine, honey.*

*Mom narrows her eyes slightly, unconvinced, but then checks her watch and sighs.*

***Mom****: (grabbing her bag) Oh, gotta run. LOVE YOU!*

*She blows a kiss and heads out the door, leaving Dad alone with Riley.*

***Zoom into Dad’s mind:***

***Dad’s Joy****: (stretching lazily) Alright, team, looks like we’ve got this under control. One sick kid, one day at home… no problem.*

*Dad’s Disgust groans, setting down his donut.*

***Dad’s Disgust****: Thanks for the image, Fear.* 

***Dad’s Sadness****: (frowning) Poor kid… I hate seeing her like this. Remember when she had that bad dream about the clown? She looked so scared…*

*The room goes quiet for a moment, the emotions all reflecting on Riley as a little girl. Finally, Dad’s Joy sits up and claps his hands together.*

***Dad’s Joy****: Alright, let’s not overthink this. Step one: Keep Riley comfy. Step two: Keep Riley entertained. Step three: Avoid a meltdown. Easy peasy.*

*He leans back again with a self-satisfied grin as Dad takes a long sip of coffee in the real world.*

***Zoom out to Riley and Dad:***

*Dad steps into the living room, where Riley is curled up on the couch with her favorite blanket.*

***Dad****: Alright, kiddo. What do you want to do first? TV? Board games?*

*Riley sniffles, her big eyes peeking over the edge of the blanket.*

***Riley****: Can we… have waffles?*

Well I should’ve known it wasn’t gonna be that easy. I realized that the water line from the bottom of the fridge to the ice maker on top that I tapped into is not under constant water pressure so I can’t pull the water even after installed the hoses.

Returning player here. Returned to the game in the Christmas week. Managed to get some levels (192 to 370) and some gear. However I'm not sure what I should do or get now to improve the character, especially on the gold bullion vendor. I run a unarmed/autoaxe build, and my gear is the following:

Usual stuff: shock gauntlet with Vamp/SS/STR/Fencer

Bosses: Poison auto axe with Vamp/PA/STR/Viper. Not using pounder yet cause it's expensive.

Armors: complete thorn armor set, all with overeater/STR/Arms Keeper/Bruiser.

Character def is around 500-700 with perks, can't remember now. Not focusing on rad resistance because I'll become a ghoul when it comes and I have a crapton of radaway to places where rad is high.

Legendary perks: STR, agi, luk. 
Will max legendary int/taking one for the team as soon as I reach 150 on the score board. Last legendary slot is with legendary endurance for the lack of better options.

Things I bought with gold bullion already are:
Thorn armor set
Gauntlet
Weight bench
Chemist backpack mod
Radstag food farm camp item
Company tea
Coffee machine (atom shop actually)


With the exception of raids and nuke bosses, all content in the game can be done solo.

What should i aim for now? I was thinking about the cryo freezer but it doesn't seem that useful because of the thru hiker and good with Sault perks, makes food weight nothing and almost never spoil. Is there a very good item for gold bullion that I'm missing currently?

1hzcsbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1hzcsbm/experiances_with_exemptions_for_rto/,Experiances with exemptions for RTO? ,"Throwaway because I know my coworkers are on here and trying to give enough detail to add context to my questions. 

Company I'm at (Tech/Engineering) announced RTO 5 days starting in June ""with exemptions being case by case"" and that ""granting remote exceptions will be rare"". 

Prior to the announcement my manager pulled me into a huddle with my 2nd line and told me it was coming but my performance is good and I could continue hybrid. Had a unrelated call with my third line after the announcement and he reiterated that I was exempt, just keep doing what I'm doing. I've heard a few other what I'd consider ""good"" employees mention they had similar chats with their 1st lines -- making me think they're trying to reduce headcount but by giving these exceptions so the key people stay. 

Our CEO is openly very anti WFH and reluctantly let it happen for covid because it was that or no work. After covid he only allowed hybrid because the rest of the industry was and it became a huge recruiting tool, productivity went up, our stock took off. Super easy for management to track who is working and performing based on job type and output (engineering on remote servers with user activity logging built in). Now that a couple big players in our industry (mainly AWS) are pushing RTO he's all about it again and apparently drawing a line in the sand. Prior to covid my group was an acquisition for the company and had been doing hybrid since around 2010 or so and when we were acquired no one said anything about continuing it or not and no one forced us to do 5 days a week even though the parent company did. We have multiple sites and people WFH when they or their kids are sick so even with 5 days RTO zoom hybrid meetings will still be needed to function. 

CEO briefly mentioned in his last few calls frustration with non-compliance for current hybrid policy of three days in but stopped short of demanding it -- just they've been looking at badging and it's been very low for all sites. Most people (including managers) at my site do what we did prior to covid: 2 days in office for group work, team lunches and meetings and leave the other three for primarily focused individual execution and small project meetings. Some people coffee badge and a few people have gone full remote but neither of those are very common. Our stock has been going bananas last couple years (and still is) because we've been crushing customer execution targets so lower and mid management has been letting what works for people go as long as the work gets done and the numbers stay up.  Sounds like that's coming to an end for most of us even though 2024 was by far the best year we've ever had and a decent LTR forecast going into 2025.

So I have a verbal exemption to keep doing what works for me now but because the CEO is so opposed to WFH and hybrid I'm skeptical of how sanctioned my exception is although I know my 1st, 2nd and 3rd lines are ok with it (CEO is my 4th line) as long as the work stays consistent. The wording of his announcement seemed to highlight full remote more than hybrid. I've also heard of a bunch of people getting exemptions so I'm not sure if that's ""rare"" enough for our CEO. 

Just got a performance bonus for working above and beyond to help a customer out, have been told numbers look good likely getting a promotion this cycle. I really like my job, they seemingly like me in return, and my 1st and 2nd lines are the best managers I've ever had. In an ideal world I'd stay put. However, given the opposition to WFH at the top I'm wondering if I'm putting too much stock in past performance value to the company and if I'd be foolish to waste this next 5 months assuming my exemption is going to hold up or I should start putting irons in the fire now. 

Mid career specialized engineer so hard but not impossible to replace me but also harder for me to quickly find a comparable job especially with the tightening of remote positions industry wide. Engineering jobs have been fleeing my state so not a lot of options left up here so a move to a new company and hybrid would likely involve uprooting and moving. 

Reality is I can't go to 5 days and core hours with a 1-2hr commute each way and make daycare pickup time and can't gamble on getting fired for insubordination because I'm the primary breadwinner and I've got mouths to feed at home and a home I'd like to keep. Took this job a decade ago for the flexibility. Get to actually see my kids  during the week and took a lot of evening stress off my wife having me there vs me commuting full time and walking in at or after dinner most nights. 

Has anyone had experience with performance based exemptions to RTO like this and how did it go 6mo to a year or two in? 

Did you get anything in writing? 

Was it pushed from the top or were your immediate/middle managers pushing for it? 

Did high performers get to stay remote or eventually called in? 

Did those that had to go in start to resent you and start cutting you out of key conversations or did it become highlighted  in employee surveys or similar and put pressure for everyone to be back? 

I've seen on the news tech companies forcing RTO but wondering how many have exemptions like this in place and how well it's held up or if all the CEOs are just waiting to see what the others do.  ",1,1736649496.0,remotework,0,1.0,False

When I turned 40, I experienced my first ocular migraine, which was scary AF but kinda trippy. 

In December, I woke up with a headache (I do have OSA and wear a CPAP religiously). I went to work that day, and the headache continued to progressively worsen. I had not had caffeine that morning, so I chalked it up to caffeine withdrawal. By that afternoon, the pain and pressure were almost unbearable, so I got a coffee, thinking that would relieve it. Within 15 minutes, I was vomiting and I was having the worst headache of my life. 

Last night, the same thing happened. I was at work and developed a severe headache; after a few hours, I was violently ill. I had to call in to work today because I was still vomiting this morning. I still have the headache—it has varied in its intensity, but it has not gone away. I tried Excedrin Migraine, but it hasn’t helped much. I can feel the pressure building up in my head, and I’m afraid I’m going to start vomiting again. 

What’s worse is that I’ve had to call in for sick days, and I am on the path to disciplinary action due to calling in; even leaving work early due to illness is a strike against me. I’m thinking about contacting my PCP about FMLA or getting prescription medication if these are truly migraines. ",2,1736649385.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

Smart thermometers, for instance, allow for precise temperature monitoring via smartphone apps, ensuring that meats are cooked to perfection without the guesswork. Automated coffee makers and smart ovens also provide convenience by allowing users to control them remotely, providing the ultimate in culinary innovation.

- **Blenders:** Essential for smoothies and sauces, high-powered blenders can crush ice and blend even the toughest ingredients with ease.
- **Spiralizers:** These handy tools transform vegetables like zucchini into healthy ""noodles,"" perfect for low-carb dishes.
- **Mandolines:** For evenly sliced fruits and vegetables, a mandoline is a must-have, offering precision and speed in the kitchen.
- **Food Processors:** Ideal for chopping, slicing, and mixing, a good food processor can significantly cut down preparation time.

Investing in quality home kitchen gadgets not only enhances cooking efficiency but also inspires culinary creativity. With endless options available, these tools are a welcome addition to any kitchen, catering to novice cooks and experienced chefs alike.

1hzcj1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1hzcj1q/lessons_from_my_14_month_job_search/,Lessons from my 14 month job search ,"Background: I was made redundant in my last role back in mid 2022 (security engineering) and it took me 14 months of applying, interviewing, getting ghosted by recruiters and hiring managers, going through bouts of deep depression - really the full roller coaster of emotions, much of it tied to my self worth as career and work is so closely tied to identify for many of us. 

On the dramatic side of it (justified at the time, rejection after rejection) I asked myself most weeks, will I ever work in my field again. Not news here but it's a terrible terrible market and has been for years. On the lighter side I found myself whether delusional of not, telling family and friends when they enquired how I was going - that I'm just going through the motions and tackling one day at a time, rolling with the punches, as they were punches one after the next after the next. 

I wanted to post this as a reminder to those that are finding it really tough at the moment and to those that are losing and have lost faith to try and stay above water, the darkness and hopelessness will come to pass. 

These are my take aways from my own journey, much of it would have been posted before but I hope some of it helps / resonates and ultimately I want to say we feel the pain you do and hopelessness that you're going through. 

You aren't alone - this is a beautiful community and I have found much solace in reddit over the last year+ for providing light hearted perspectives as well as particularly this sub that the world is very fucked and from the sub perspective/s, there are many horror stories, some hilarious, others atrocious. 

Some of these lessons are obvious, some may need reminding:

1) this job market is truly fucked (it's not you, it's global, every market) you are not alone. 

2) if you spend all day every day thinking about how bad it is and your lack of role it will crush you, you have to take a break so you don't overwhelm yourself because it is very hard otherwise. I've gone through bouts of depression, it is normal but don't sit in it for too long. Get out and get some fresh air or sunshine (VD) or even see a mate, break up the darkness in any way you can so it's not constant. Being out among people, even sitting in a cafe or in a park does help. 

3) if you can, get a part time job, hospitality is a good and honest industry (I went back to making coffee). Whilst it's not related to my formal qualifications, it has given me some walking around money and you're around people - this was probably the single biggest thing that kept me above water mentally for my year of hell. Breaking up your corp applications (if applicable) with some other maybe non related work helps you take your mind of the endless self worth internal thought track and puts some space between the mental gymnastics of actually doing an application and working. 

   There are many people who think just because they went to university and got a degree in x means they never again have to drop back into a services industry or work that shit dead end job to make ends meet, should times get tough. Do what you need to do to get by and fuck anyone that looks down on you or judges you for this, I dealt with this bullshit from folks within my friendship group and community and I don't have time for those people anymore, kicking me when I'm down was brutal and it really fucking hurt, that speaks to their character, not mine. For me the industry I fell back to was hospitality, for you it could be something else. It was one of the first things I did at the start of my now 14 month search which  I complimented with attempted consistent applications (not always successful but I tried). 

   The people that think this approach is beneath them are the ones that fall the hardest should their turn ever come and they're down and out, no this was not ideal but if you have the ability to walk and carry things or even another skill in a seperate industry - use these skills. Many people just can't face up to it but I needed money and my family came first, so I put my ego aside. I realise securing this other job is not a given and I'm grateful that I couls, I take nothing for granted anymore. You have to fight for everything. 

   Through this job I developed a few really nice friendships and as someone in their thirties, the older you get the harder it is to make friends (reality). This was a nice silver lining for me, now I've got a few buddies I can have a beer with that I didn't have before, who know me well now, that in itself is a big deal for me. 

4) small goals of applications / cv tweaks or LI bio refreshes each week, every other week is good - whatever it is - small steps but consistent ones as is most practical, a few at a time do help. Don't try and do everything all at once, you'll see failure, you'll go into a hole and that isn't what will help.

5) recruiters are in my experience helpful sometimes but don't rely on someone else to drive finding you a role. Recruiters can help, but frequently they are full of shit and will ghost you - remember - it's not you, it's them, there is very little decency anymore, there should be some if there is an engagement between you and them but that's not the world we live in. When you do get ghosted, tell them to fuck off on your head, then move on. 

   I've spent far too much time being angry at other people for doing this, when if I think about it, I was nothing more than a possible fill to a position, one in a long line of candidates on their screen, just a number. I now think for recruiters as software, they serve an input output function, they are not my friend, they are not my emotional companion. If I view them as transactional which they are, their role is transactional, I don't get as angry when they treat me this way, it's just the nature of the beast and the. industry

6) do your own research, your own cross check of roles, is it on LI = yes, is it on the employers site = No - probably a fake add or them trying to harvest data or salary check the market for how low they can actually put the salary, there's been lots of discussion of this in the states and it's hard to deal with so be stringent, vet and if it looks suss, move on. 

7) if you find a role on LI, my opinion is don't apply on LinkedIn. Find the real job and apply on the company website, you'll get lost in the noise and your application won't be reviewed if you do it though LI. Given how many people throw applications at job ads I would be surprised if it was looked at by a human but a recruiter can comment further. 

   Tweak your cv before you submit, if it doesn't align to the role, try and make it align without straight up lying. If you lie on your cv, you will get caught out eventually, it's what the multi round interview process is partly about, not just what's on the paper but who is the person, do they know what they claim to, do they fit the role etc

8) apply widely (within reason). Not one job here, one job there. It won't work. It is a numbers game and you really do need to pump those numbers. It's the only way.

9) cover letters are contentious - I would say if you have a role that you're made for, you'll know if it's the one - write a cover letter, one page and tell them why you. That plus a cv (resume), I would hope helps elevate you in the pile of cvs. 

   This has been hit and miss, again one for recruiters. I will ask my HR rep if mine made a difference, I think it did but will confirm and update thread. 

10) key words - no one is looking at your cv just off you hitting submit unless the hiring manager gets it directly and maybe you have a connection to them / you've LI-mailed them / already have a thread with them. Your cv goes through internal scanning (keyword matching etc), which I'm told frequently doesn't work as it's intended, resulting in people getting binned or overlooked that are a good match. 

   Look at the job ad, then if you have cross over skills but they aren't mentioned on your cv pull some of those words into your cv. You don't need to be fancy about it. Just have a section of ""Key Skills"" then start writing those seperate by a comma or forward slash - that's it. Make it easier for the scanners. 

11) simplicity -  if a person were to read your cv and can't then at a bare minimum tell you what you do or have accomplished / achieved - how is a hiring manager supposed to know and apply it to their open role? I've spoken to many people about this and they all say the same thing. 

KISS will never get old: Keep It Simple Stupid

   Dont overestimate a hiring manager or recruiters ability to read your cv and know what you do - make it easy to understand. 

12) be kind to yourself, you're going through in many respects - a traumatic experience. Treat yourself with care and actually take care of yourself, eat right, get proper sleep, temper the use of bad social media (reddit isn't included BUT reddit can be bad as with too much of anything can be). 

13) turn off all LinkedIn notifications and unfollow people, this is a huge one - I personally could not handle all the self congratulatory, narcissistic, self ejaculation, masturbation horseshit aka the necessary hellscape that is LinkedIn over the last year. 

   It was eating my soul because I had to use it for role searching, so I tapped out of all of it 6 months or so ago. I had a rule of not looking at the LinkedIn feed AND ONLY using the job search / role search function / its power search to find hiring managers to connect and ping about applications I submitted. 

   I unfollowed pretty much my entire community - this was a self protection thing, I couldn't handle seeing other people's shit whether it was another person who landed or whatever, the platform sucked my motivation and self worth so I put a stop to it. I highly highly recommend if you're feeling like shit you do the same. I won't go back, there is no point just like all social media, it sucks enough of my time and for what gain, really? 

   Use it sparingly, if you can, then just get on with the job you eventually land and get the fuck off it (there are some roles where that isn't possible as your role is to live on LinkedIn. That isn't the case for me and I am glad, I just don't have the capacity for it and I know many feel the same way. 

**

These are some of my lessons learned and I hope they help you on your journey. This is the first real post I've done to reddit, if this should also go into another sub please let me know where to cross post if that's the right term? 

And most importantly, I would appreciate your feedback and input from your own experience, do you have crossover do these points resonate? Do you disagree, why? Are there things I've missed, no doubt!

So I have this friend I would like to get thoughts on...

Backstory:
We met around a year ago through a university project. Right off the bat we clicked super well, I had never felt so comfortable around a guy before, especially so fast. Didn't take long until we started spending long hours at school together almost on a daily basis. He would always initiate, drive me home, buy me coffee, always come to the gym when I said I would go, take me home again etc. Our connection grew quite deep - and then I found out he had a girl... of course. By that time I had managed to develop feelings, obviously, looking at the treatment he was giving me. Then my inner struggles began, doing everything in my power to overcome these immoral feelings I shouldn't have - multiple times I tried to cut contact but it always lead back to the same place, plus we had shared projects so it was almost impossible. From his side nothing changed either. 

Fast forward to this fall and I had managed to find peace in me, realizing I'm happy to have him as friend and all I want is for him to be happy, whomever with.

We still share a strong friendship and he is still acting the same way as before, even wanting to join the boxing club I'm going to... He also agreed to help me with bringing a new sofa to my place, which took 6hrs, a lot of driving, carrying and it was all at night lol.

I had a short period when I was dating this other guy, but (suprise suprise) it didn't work out as the emotional connection wasn't there.

This guy has never talked about his relationship with me, but a few days ago he learned I had broken things off with the guy I was dating. It was then when I learned he is really struggling in his relationship too. We haven't much hanged out outside of things related to school, but when I asked what's wrong he said it was so personal he would rather talk about it in real life so we are about to have a talk about it at a cafe now.

So probably you can sense the confusion I'm having here. He is a very outgoing person and I wonder if I'm overthinking the whole situation and if he is just being extremely friendly? Then again he is not having that kind of a friendship with anyone else I know.

It has been a messed up situation for way too long now and it is making me feel terrible as a person, but I really cannot put into words the way we care about each other. And booy have I tried to get over this thing. 

I know it raises judgement, and I guess the convo we're going to have when he's back in town might give some clarity, but I'm interested to hear other people's thoughts on this.

People around me are of course certain he has some kind of feelings, but could it be that it is truly just a strong friendship he sees in this?",1,1736648573.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

AGAIN, he stops talking to me after that and only responds the night before our arranged coffee. he simply says “would you like to go to ____ garden/park??” (not mentioning the name in case he’s reading this you prick). i kindly let him know that there’s currently construction in the area, and they’re closed. and again; throw the ball in his court to pick a place. he simply reacts to the message and doesn’t respond; ever. this was back in december. he still likes EVERYTHING on my social media, and views every story the minute i post, and has recently replied to one of them. i simply mirrored his behavior and reacted without responding. everything is screaming red flags, but it’s eating me alive. i don’t know whether to confront him and ask him for clarity/closure; a simple “hey im not feeling this connection anymore” would be MORE THAN ENOUGH, or to just block. or should i just hook up with him and move on (lol jk but not kidding!) pls help im begging i’ve done everything to stop thinking about him

(i forgot to mention this earlier, but in between the period when he stopped talking to me, he randomly asked me what i was up to one night, to which i replied that i had plans and that’s it. he said “that’s too bad, i was gonna ask you out for dinner or a movie if you’re down”. and i said no thank you; i have plans. he ignored me :))",1,1736648403.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

A large transparent dome space was created so that visitors can enjoy the waterfall while avoiding the cold and wind. About 100 people can enter at the same time.


In addition, a large Christmas tree and landscape lighting were installed to add to the holiday season atmosphere, and a photo zone was decorated with the 'Search' doll, the official mascot of Seodaemun-gu.

I’m sorry I don’t judge others for how they do things it’s not my problem, but obviously the party she is throwing is a gift grab, it’s neither kid nor adult centered—and WE had bought the birthday girl $100 outfit (dress, shoes and bow unicorn style) because it’s what my niece wanted and we do love her but it’s insane …btw the dad , my in laws , and my niece mom all work and make good money , it’s not like they are poor trust me although they are always crying misery. 

I have to note, my sons parties are not some extravagant ballroom type things but I always have kid centered activities—the last one we did at a water park, in which we paid all the kids entrance, bought chicken nuggets & Mac and cheese, pizza, cupcakes & connolis , juice boxes for the kids, soda for adults , water, cute decorations, gift bags with sunglasses, stickers & small toys, all in the same theme, coloring booklets with my sons name on it thanking them for coming. At least the kids were able to have FUN & EAT! I’m not comparing how much I can spend but honestly they can buy some pizza & maybe do the party at a public park, like I used to do it at this little park by  a beach it was FREE when my mom was single -it was very low cost & kids had FUN. The point is she is comparing my beautiful thoughtful parties to her non parties…in all of this I feel very bad for my niece of course but the mom & dad do not want to give effort in any aspect of her life, not just the ‘party’.

Anyway, so I’m realllllllyyyyy not looking forward to running after my son while he throws himself on their uncut grass in a backyard where the fence is broken and they live on the corner of a major highway 😭😭😭 because the inside of their home is completely hoarded with toys & clothes & all sorts of items..and it’s always dirty. Which is also why they do the ‘ party’ outside ..basically a table with a cover , happy birthday banner, the cake & people sitting g in chairs. 

She also mentioned to my grandma that it’s a ‘Cuban party’ like girl NO my grandma used to throw me Cuban parties which is lots and lots of homemade Cuban food, the entire family helping out decorating, kids were in the pool with water guns & water balloons, we had things to do ! And my family was pretty low income back then.

Ok so on to other reasons I think it’s a toy grab party— she invited my sister, my parents , my grandparents, my aunt—they allll give great gifts. I’m so so pissed because they are being used! We have all built our lives up from the ground! And these people just want to leech and I’m so so tired of it. They were never close to my family before my marriage to their son. 

So I’m really thinking I’m going to start getting a stomach ache the night before and pretend I ate bad & just skip it & tell my husband to pls go & say I’m sorry ✌️ that will save my mom also because my mom will stay to ‘take care of my son’ while I’m sick lol. But I’d feel bad my sister may be on the hook..idk what to do what do you think? I’m so tired of their BS!!! But there are innocents in the middle .

I'm a very picky eater (and drinker), so it might just be that, but I didn't feel a need to pick up the habit. Not to say I don't consume any caf, I like my sodas just as much as the next, but coffee's taste in particular is so bitter to me.

I have already taken my coffee machine to the coffee mechanic and they aparently fixed it - they didnt tell me what was wrong with it, or what they did to fix it, they just gave it back...

I made my first coffee yesterday, and it worked as expected reaching 9ish bars with a known bean grind size. However, today I try to make a coffee (same bean, grind size, all conditions remained the same) and it would go through 7 seconds of pre-infusion and then coudltn reach bar - no matter how fine i grind the bean.

I have confirmed (using a backflush) that the machine can reach full pressure... So then what is happening when I try pull a shot?

I have done quite a bit of testing this morning with varying grind sizes:

1. Varia Vs3 = 3
2. Varia Vs3 = 3.3+/-0.1 (This is my noraml gridn size for this particular bean)
3. Varia Vs3 = 3.6+/1

Does anyone have any suggestions? I feel like ive tried to self trouble shoot for long enough and not getting anywhere...

1hzc0oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HarioSwitch/comments/1hzc0oh/never_hot_enough/,Never hot enough,"This is just a little gripe of mine that stops me from using the Switch as much as I might otherwise, but the coffee it makes is never hot enough for my liking. 

I rinse the filter paper, I then fill it with boiling water and let it sit until the glass feels hot to the touch. I re-boil the kettle, I drain the Switch and fill it with ground coffee and freshly boiled water, then I pre-heat my mug while I wait 4 minutes for it to brew. When I finally drain the coffee into the mug and drink it it's never quite at the temperature I'd like. Whether I use a regular plastic V60, or a French Press, both produce a hotter result that's more preferable and it's frustrating. 

Anyone else find this to be an issue? (I should probably add that I am a heathen amongst speciality coffee enthusiasts because I do enjoy a splash of milk in my coffee and that undoubtedly contributes to a slight drop in temperature too.)",0,1736647014.0,HarioSwitch,1,0.5,False

She constantly makes comments about how none of her old clothes fit her and how she needs to get her steps in and how she eats this. I recently went to the mall with her for the first time in a while and she was looking at jeans and she was like this looks so big and asking me how big it looks. She also was really into sizing and how shes small. She asked me what i had for breakfast and i didnt want to answer but i did and when i did she gave a full rundown on how she just had egg whites and a chicken sausage. When it was lunch time she started saying how she needs a snack soon and insisted on sharing a meal. She also wanted a coffee and was telling me how her choice was healthy. I dont know what to do. Everything she said was so triggering. I dont like this and i dont want to go back to having an ed but all her comments and how she wears skin tight clothes to show off her figure is very triggering to me and makes me want to go back.

1hzbx9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1hzbx9z/greenes_horizon_a_post_apocalyptic_journal_is_a/,Greene's Horizon A Post Apocalyptic Journal is a little something I've been working on here and there in my free time. I have posted in another sub.,"Entry 1 Reminiscing 

 

You ever find yourself lookin' back, ponderin' how everything went to hell? Here in what's left of Longview, TX, it's hard not to reminisce about when it all began. People had their theories on what would bring the downfall. It wasn't zombies takin' charge, nor aliens. No catastrophic disease wiped us out. It was greed plain and simple. Greed that brought it all down. And who am I foolin'? I was as guilty as anyone. As long as I had my peace, didn't much care 'bout the world beyond. 

It all unfolded so gradual, sneakin' up on us. Things just kept gettin' worse. Folks takin' from folks, government squeezin' every dime, taxes creepin' up while wages stayed put. It all boiled over into an economic collapse, not enough to go 'round for everyone. People started pickin' sides based on their politics and soon enough, fists started flyin'. Government thought they could clamp down with martial law, but that only fueled the fire. Somewhere along the way, it turned into a full-blown Civil War. While we were busy tearin' each other apart, a few other nations saw their chance. They jumped in, one after another, and before we knew it, the whole damn world was at war. Alliances formed, and it was like the final straw breakin' the camel's back. As nations fought, their own people turned on each other. By the time the dust settled, there weren't many left, at least here in America. 

 

 

Entry 2 The Start 

 

Well, reckon I oughta start at the beginning. 'Bout eight years back, the whole world went to war, and that's when everything started unravellin'. Society just collapsed under the weight of it all. 'Round here in the states, ain’t much left but ruins and assholes. 

Folks got desperate real quick. Cities turned into battlegrounds, and the countryside weren't much better. Those of us left, we had to fend for ourselves. Scavengin' what we could, watchin' our backs every damn minute. It was survival of the fittest, and luckier than most, I reckon. 

It was downright horrific at first, but now it’s just plain sad. Seein' how low folks can stoop is heartbreakin'. At the start, it was easier to keep clear of the chaos. Didn’t have to go far to find someone lookin' to take from others. I stayed on the move, stickin' to them old farm roads and logging trails. Folks didn’t venture out that way 'til they'd picked the land clean of anything worth takin'. 

Them days, it was a sight easier to get 'round. Gasoline hadn’t gone sour yet. Could fill up the tank and drive for miles without worryin' 'bout runnin' dry. Now, you gotta scavenge for every drop, prayin' it won't clog your engine worse than it already is. Seems like every little thing's just a bit harder now. 

Ah, hell, I reckon I've rambled on enough in this journal. The only reason I'm putting pen to paper is to hold onto a semblance of sanity. I believe it's time for me to retire for the night. 

 

Entry 3 The Present 

 

Woke up this mornin’ to the sound of birds chirpin’. Funny how somethin’ so normal can feel like a luxury these days. Stepped out of my makeshift shelter and took a deep breath of the crisp morning air. The sun was just peekin’ over the horizon, casting long shadows over the broken buildings and tangled weeds of what used to be a bustling town. 

Had to remind myself to stay alert, even in moments of quiet. Danger’s always lurkin’, whether it’s other folks lookin’ to take what ain’t theirs or just the unforgiving nature of this new world. Made my way to the outskirts of town, hopin’ to find some supplies left behind. Been hearin’ rumors about a group settin’ up camp nearby. Don’t know if they’re friend or foe, but reckon it’s worth findin’ out. 

As I walked, memories of better times kept driftin’ back. Sunday barbecues, laughin’ with friends, the simple joy of a cold beer on a hot day. Hard to believe how much has changed. Sometimes feels like a whole different lifetime. But there ain’t no goin’ back, only forward. 

After searchin' around for a few hours, I managed to scrounge up some cans of veggies and a couple of batteries. Ain’t sure if they work yet. Still hopin' to find a handheld radio, maybe catch a signal, see if anyone’s out there. Don’t much fancy interactin' too much, but it's hard to keep a grip on reality when the only company you got is the trees.  

Won’t be too long 'fore I have to up and move again. Don’t wanna be found out by any groups. Thinkin' I’ll head on into the Angelina National Forest. Ain’t too far a trip from Longview. Pretty sure there's still some cabins out there, and the wildlife should be plentiful. Hopin' I can stay there a spell without too much worry. 

 

Entry 4 Others 

 

'Bout halfway to the Angelina National Forest, I came across a family broke down on the side of the road. A father, mother, and their kid. Must've given 'em quite a scare, but trust's a rare commodity these days. They were havin' car trouble, so I offered to help in exchange for some trade. They didn't have much to offer except information. Turns out, they were runnin' from that group settin' up near Longview. Guess they weren’t good people after all. 

Anyhow, these folks didn’t seem too bad. After takin' a good look under the hood, I figured out they'd thrown a rod. Ain’t no fixin' that, so I told 'em where I was headin' and offered to let 'em tag along till we find another ride. After loadin' them and their stuff up, we headed out. 

Some time passed in awkward silence, and I was getting’ tired of it, so I popped in an old CD and lit up a smoke. You should’ve seen their faces. I thought they were angry ‘bout me smokin’ with the kid in the truck, but nope—they just hadn’t heard music in a long while. 

After a bit more drivin', while they enjoyed the music, we happened upon Center, TX. Used to be a peaceful, small country town, but now... it’s just dilapidated. Figured this was as good a place as any to try and find them a ride of their own. 

We looked ‘round for a while and found some decent stuff. Managed to spot a car that'd fit them and their belongings. It ain’t runnin', but I reckon I can fix it. After some more scavenging, I found a local mechanic shop and gathered the parts I needed. It’d take a bit of time, but it should do the trick. 

Spent the last few hours of daylight workin’ on that car, getting’ my hands greasy and sweat drippin’ down my face. The family pitched in where they could, passin’ tools and keepin’ watch. The father—turns out his name’s Jim—was a real help, and his wife, Mary, kept their boy, Tommy, busy. Kid’s got a curious mind, kept askin’ questions ‘bout what I was doin’. 

As the sun dipped below the horizon, we decided to set up camp for the night. Found a safe spot and got a little fire goin’. The warmth and the crackle of the flames made it feel almost normal for a while. We finally made proper introductions. Jim’s a mechanic, which explained his knack for helpin' out with the car. Mary used to be a nurse, and little Tommy was just eight years old, full of questions and wide-eyed wonder despite everything. 

Over the fire, we shared what little food we had, and stories too. Jim and Mary talked about their life before things went to hell—Jim’s love for old cars and Mary’s passion for helping people. They’d been on the move for months, always lookin’ over their shoulders. 

I told ‘em a bit about myself, too. How I’d been wanderin’, tryin’ to stay clear of trouble, and how I ended up in Longview. There was a comfort in the simplicity of the conversation, a reminder of what it meant to be human. 

As the fire burned low, we all settled into a weary but peaceful silence. It wasn’t much, but it was a connection, and in these times, that was worth more than gold. Tomorrow, we’d see if the car would run, but for tonight, we had each other and a flicker of hope. 

As the sun peaked over the horizon, I rose and coaxed the fire back to life. Luck had been on my side—I'd managed to scavenge some coffee yesterday, so it was shaping up to be a mighty fine morning. After brewing myself a cup cowboy style, I returned to the car and put the finishing touches. With a quiet prayer, I turned the key and she started right up. The rumble of the engine must've startled Jim and Mary awake, prompting them to rush out to see what was happening. I couldn't help but grin as they came over, their faces a mix of surprise and relief. 

 

Entry 5 Separate Ways 

After a quick breakfast, I helped them load their things into the newly fixed car. As we worked, they asked if I had any plans for settling down somewhere. I shook my head and told them I didn’t feel safe settlin’ down anywhere for too long. This world had a way of turnin’ on you when you got too comfortable.  

They nodded, understanding my reasons, and we exchanged farewells. I watched them pull away, a small knot of worry forming in my chest as I saw them disappear down the road. I shook my head, trying to clear away the unease, and turned my focus back to the task at hand—scavengin' what I could. I needed to gather enough supplies to make it through the mild winter that was on its way. 

 

Entry 6 Unexpected Freeze 

You ever get that feelin' like you’ve got everything lined up just right, and then Mother Nature comes along and throws a damn wrench in the works? Yeah, well, seems this winter’s decidin' it ain’t gonna be mild after all. Temps are already droppin' below freezin'. Got me a bit agitated, I’ll admit, but at least I found myself an old log cabin with a wood-burnin' stove and a decent pile of seasoned firewood. Small victories, I rreckon. 

Here’s hopin’ I got enough food to stretch if I ration it right. Huntin’ ain’t gonna do me no good in this weather, and there sure as hell ain’t no wild fruits around either. Might have to make the trek into town, see if there’s any old cans left on the shelves, maybe even find me some books. One way or another, I gotta ride this out.  

Wouldn’t ya know it, while I was in town, it started snowin’. Snow! Can you believe that? I can’t recall the last time we saw snow in this part of Texas. Mother Nature sure has her mean streak, don’t she? Still, I managed to scrounge up a few more cans of food and even found some books I’m lookin’ forward to. Guess it ain’t all bad. 

Reckon it'll be a spell before I jot anything down in this old journal again. Figured I'd just sit back, read, and take it easy ‘til spring rolls around. Here's hopin' nothin' comes along to throw a wrench in that plan—knock on wood. 

 

Entry 7 Wrench in The Plans 

 

Damn it, damn it all to hell! I done jinxed it. Of course another group of survivors just had to be in the area, and of course they just had to see the damn smoke of my fire. How long they’ve been here; I’ve no damn clue, but now they’re asking me to house them in this cramped little cabin. There ain’t many of ‘em just five, but that five more then I wanted to see. There are two men ones older probably in his fifties, the other a bit younger, thirties maybe. Then the three women, looks like they range from maybe twenty to late forties. I really don’t wanna deal with them, but if they keep botherin me I might have to do something. 

 

Entry 8 Trouble 

 

Well, they went and made the damn choice for me. I stepped out for a bit, just to clear my head and shake off some of that cabin fever. When I came back, there they were—crowded 'round my place, hootin' and hollerin', makin' all sorts of demands. Talkin’ big ‘bout how I needed to share my food and shelter, as if I owed 'em somethin’. Far as I could tell, none of 'em had a gun, so I raised my rifle and let off a shot into the air, just to shut ‘em up. That got their attention real quick. They tried arguin’, throwin’ all kinds of reasons at me, but I weren’t havin’ none of it. I’d already made it crystal clear—I ain’t helpin’ ‘em. As I stood there, watchin' their faces shift from shock to anger, I knew I had a choice to make. These folks might not have guns, but desperation makes people do crazy things. We stood there, locked in a stare down, until one of 'em got bold. But a well-placed warning shot had him stoppin' dead in his tracks—funny how a bullet whizzin' past your head'll do that. I made it real clear the next one wouldn’t be a warnin', and they best be leavin’. Guess they finally caught on that I wasn’t messin' around. That night, I rigged up some simple alarm traps, just in case they came back. They didn’t. But now I reckon I’ll have to find another spot to ride out the winter ‘fore things really take a turn for the worse. 

 

Entry 9 The Search 

When the sun finally decided to peek back out, I stepped outside with a new mission—find somewhere even more secluded. As I wandered, my boots hittin' the 147 bridge, I stopped and glanced out over Sam Rayburn Lake. That’s when I saw ‘em—small islands scattered across the water, sittin’ there quiet as could be. Can’t rightly figure why I didn’t think of it sooner. Guess even I ain’t above a little foolishness now and then. 

With that idea stuck in my head, I set off to search every lake house I could find, intent on scroungin’ up a boat. If I could just get myself to one of those islands, I reckoned I’d be sittin’ real pretty. Trouble was, findin’ a boat wasn’t the problem—fixin’ one up was. Most of ‘em were rusted out or had seen better days, and even if I could get one runnin’, there weren’t no guarantees it’d hold up. Seemed to me the best bet was somethin’ simple, like a canoe or maybe a little rowboat. Just somethin’ I could load up my gear and paddle my way out to some peace and quiet. 

  

Entry 10 New Home 

  

After another restless night at the cabin, I figured there wouldn’t be a second chance to leave without trouble followin’. So I made my mind up—time to move on. I headed to that lake house where I’d spotted the best-condition john boat of the lot. The motor on it was shot, so I tore it clean off and set out huntin’ for a pair of paddles. Didn’t take me long to find some, and soon enough, they were tossed in the bed of my truck, along with everything worth takin’ from the cabin. Hell, I even wrestled that stubborn wood-burnin’ stove out of there. That fight nearly got the better of me, but I wasn’t about to leave behind somethin’ that could mean the difference between survivin’ and freezin’. 

Course, it’s a fool’s errand to think I’ll get all this across in one trip. That little boat’ll take some back-and-forth haulin’, no two ways about it. But I’ve already picked my destination—a small, lonely island sittin’ about forty-five minutes out from the nearest shoreline. Secluded, outta sight, and far enough from anyone wanderin’ too close for comfort. If I can make it there, maybe—just maybe—I’ll find myself some peace.  

Well, I’ll be damned—it’s like I done hit the jackpot. After rowing so hard I nearly threw my back clean out, I finally reached the island, and what do I find? A house already sittin’ there, like it’d been waitin’ on me all along. And not just any house, mind you. This place must’ve belonged to some rich son of a gun. It's massive, with those floor-to-ceiling windows like you’d see in one of them fancy magazines. Gonna have to board those up quick-like, though—they’re just askin’ for trouble. Strangest thing is, for all the time it’s been out here, it ain’t taken much of a beatin’ from the weather. Lucky me, I reckon. 

Got all my gear hauled over in just a couple of days and made sure to stash my truck good and out of sight. While I was snoopin’ around the place some more, I struck gold again—found a stash of fishing gear tucked away. Reckon I’ll be sittin’ pretty here for the rest of the winter. Hell, might even finally crack open those books I’ve been meanin’ to read, the ones I had to set aside when that cabin got all riled up. 

I can picture it now: sittin’ by a nice campfire, line in the water, just takin’ it all in. Lord knows I ain’t fished in years, but somethin’ about this feels right, almost like it’s a bit of normal pokin’ through all this mess. Could even see myself stickin’ around past winter. For the first time in a while, it feels like I might’ve found a place worth callin’ home. 

  

Entry 11 Spring 

Well, spring’s crept in, though it ain’t in no hurry to make itself known. The snow’s been gone for a spell—it never sticks ‘round long in these parts—but the chill’s still hangin’ on like it don’t know when to quit. Probably be a couple more weeks before it starts to feel like spring proper. These last few months, though, they’ve been peaceful enough. Got plenty of readin’ done, which was a nice change of pace, but I’ll tell you one thing—I’m downright sick of fish. If I don’t see another scaly bastard for a good long while, it’ll still be too soon. 

Still, this island’s been good to me, but I’m thinkin’ it’s about time to move on. Cabin fever’s settin’ in, and I need to see somethin’ other than these trees and this lake. First thing’s first, though—I’ll need to check on the truck and see if she’ll even start. 

  

Entry 12 Moving On 

Hours later, there I was, yelling and cussing at that damn truck like it owed me money, blood dripping from my knuckles where the wrench had slipped and sent ‘em crashing into the frame. It felt like the truck was winning this fight, and let me tell ya, I don’t take kindly to losing—not even to an old hunk of metal. I’d been wrestling with the fuel filter, and it was putting up one hell of a battle. 

Before that, I’d spent more time than I care to admit scrounging up a working battery and airing up the tires. You wouldn’t think finding something as simple as a damn battery would be so hard, but nothin’s easy these days. Anyway, by the time the sun started to set, I’d about hit my limit. I sighed, muttered a few choice words, and crawled into the back seat for what promised to be an uncomfortable night. 

The next morning, after choking down a light breakfast—no coffee, of course—I got back to it. That fuel filter wasn’t gonna beat me, not today. It took some elbow grease and a fair bit of stubbornness, but I finally got the godforsaken thing swapped out. Feeling a bit victorious, I climbed into the driver’s seat, ready to fire her up. And wouldn’t ya know it, nothin’ happened. 

I’ll admit, I threw a proper tantrum. Might’ve even invented a few new curse words in the process. Once I got all the anger outta my system, I popped the hood to figure out what went wrong, and I’ll be damned—I’d forgotten to hook the battery back up after changing it. Ain’t that just the way? 

I let out a sigh big enough to change the weather, tightened up the battery clamps, and climbed back in. She fired up—rough as hell, but she fired. I leaned back in the seat, breathing a little easier for the first time in days. With the truck rumbling along, I grabbed a bite to eat and pulled out a map to start planning my next move. Wherever I was headed, it was time to get goin’. ",1,1736646722.0,writers,1,1.0,False

This has been asked here in various ways over time, and I did find *some* answers but I thought I'd tap into your collective consciousness one more time for fresh updates!

I’m looking for a rather specific type of place that most likely only long-timers with deep insider insights would know about: cafes, coffee shops, libraries, etc. on high floors with nice Birds Eye views of Tokyo. Preferably where I could take my laptop/books and work/study for at least a couple of hours at a time. (Other than coworkers spaces like Tsutaya Share Lounges.)

1hzbwi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hzbwi7/one_night_at_the_society_of_liars/,One Night at the Society of Liars,"You know, in this day and age, everything has its own society, community, or forum—whether offline or online. Even the strange and nonsensical ones.

Have you ever heard about a bunch of kids taking pictures with DSLR lens caps? Yeah, very specific—the lens caps. That falls into the ""doesn't-make-sense"" category for me, and yet, it has its own societies and communities in different cities.

Welcome to millennial! Yay!

Now, if you think about it, it wouldn't be odd to find that almost everything else has its own society, community, or forum.

Take liars, for example.

Yeah, liars—people who tell lies. They have their own society too. I mean, why not? Especially when you're in the habit of lying, constantly telling lies, and want a safe space to do it without hurting your family or loved ones. It’s much easier to lie to a group of people who already know you’re lying than to deceive the people who truly matter to you.

I was once a part of this Society of Liars.

Once.

Like any other society, the Society of Liars I’m talking about had a name. It was called Liar’s Dinner, because it was held once a week at night, where we shared lies over dinner and snacks. Pretty much like any other gathering, except for one key rule: everything we said was a lie. Every single thing.

And all the members of the gathering must react and respond as if the story is real, no matter how badly the lies are told by other members.

There are many reasons why people tell lies.

The most common is to avoid trouble—truth gets you into trouble, so you lie. Others lie because they’re manipulators; they enjoy controlling situations and people. But the most fascinating liars, in my opinion, are the dreamers—the ones who wish they could do something they never could, so they lie about it. They lie about being great at something, just to feel the thrill of admiration. It gives them the same satisfaction as a successful person bragging about their achievements.

The difference is, it’s all a lie.

When people believe them, they feel like their worth skyrockets—like they’ve ascended to a higher level of respect or quality.

But in reality, they haven’t.

As seasoned liars, most of us could spot the difference between truth and lies, no matter how well-disguised. Some lies are obvious, even to a child.

Take Danny Allman, for example—a short, chubby, awkward guy and a terrible liar. His lies were so bad, they were almost entertaining. He’d spin the same stories over and over, about robbing banks or hooking up with supermodels. You didn’t need a Ph.D. in psychology to know he was lying.

Then there are lies that only experts can debunk. Like if someone claims to have robbed a bank but gets the details wrong, someone with experience would catch it immediately.

A lie is a lie—it didn’t happen. And if you’ve lived with lies long enough, you can always tell the difference.

But have I ever met someone who told a lie so convincing that it sounded like the truth? A story where every detail matched, down to the tiniest nuance?

Yes, I have.

Do I think they were lying or telling the truth?

Well, you tell me.

It was the 57th Liar’s Dinner gathering. Only seven out of 24 members showed up—it was a cold and rainy night.

One of the Society of Liars’ core rules was anonymity. No one knew anyone’s real identity. We all used fake names, and no personal details were shared when we joined. The only things we knew about each other were our faces, fake names, and the lies we told.

My name in the society was Lucas Dwell—Luke for short.

I ran from the parking lot to the building to avoid the rain, knocked on the door, and was greeted by Max.

“Yo, Luke! Our Liar of the Month is here!” Max exclaimed, grinning. “How’s your day, mate?”

“Terrible, as always. Everything went horribly wrong today,” I replied, stepping inside. In the Liar’s Dinner, the moment you entered the room, everything you said had to be a lie.

“Wow, that’s sad,” Max said with a chuckle, handing me a cup of warm coffee.

The others—Danny, Lionel, Neil, and Randall—were already there. Shortly after, Nicholas arrived, making it seven of us.

Max started the meeting, and we all took turns telling our lies. Danny kicked things off with his usual nonsense—crime sprees and supermodels. Predictable. Lionel tried something new, claiming he’d hooked up with a famous actress. Close, but the details didn’t quite add up. Neil and Randall teamed up, boasting about launching a startup that became wildly successful in just three months. Too good to be true.

Finally, it was Nicholas’ turn. Usually, he’d launch straight into tales of glamour and luxury. But that night was different.

He sat there, scanning the room, a strange smile on his face.

“Well,” he began, “this week, I experienced something I’ve never experienced before. Something extreme.”

He paused, letting the silence build.

“I murdered someone.”

The room fell silent, everyone staring at him in disbelief.

Throughout 57 meetups with 24 members, no one ever told a story—or a lie—about murdering someone. Some members did share stories about doing horrible things to people they hated, like their bosses or their bullies, but never a murder.

""Wow! This is new!"" Max exclaimed from the back, as excited as ever, clapping his hands slowly. ""Go on!""

""It actually happened three days ago,"" Nicky began his story. ""The day started out like every other day. I woke up in the morning, had breakfast, and kissed my wife goodbye before heading to work."" Unlike the way he had opened his session earlier, his voice softened as he started his story.

""So, I did my job as best as I could at the office, just like I always do. However, unlike every other day, it turned out to be the worst day ever. That morning, I had a meeting with a potential investor for the company I work for. I’ve never had a problem dealing with third parties before—whether they were future clients or investors—but this one guy I met that morning was really tough. He asked me questions, and I answered, but no matter what I said, he always had a counterargument. It was as if everything I said was wrong.

""You know, it wasn’t the first time I talked to potential investors. I’ve been doing this for years. Most of the questions they ask are predictable, and I know the answers by heart. So, I started to think that this guy was intentionally giving me a hard time.

""And I didn’t know why.

""Long story short, the deal fell through. It was a complete failure. My boss had warned me beforehand that this deal was huge, so if I failed, I’d be in trouble.

""And I was.

""When I got back to the office, I had to endure the full wrath of my boss. My day was officially ruined. And it didn’t stop there—it got worse. Just as my boss was done yelling at me, he reminded me of another meeting in the afternoon. That’s when I realized I’d forgotten to bring the files he needed for the meeting.

""I couldn’t afford more trouble, so I sneaked out of the office and drove home. My plan was simple: grab the files and get back before my boss noticed I was gone.

""But when I got home, I heard noises coming from my bedroom. It was my wife, moaning with pleasure. I walked toward the doorway. It wasn’t closed, so I could see everything clearly—my wife in the middle of having sex with another man.

""I didn’t know who he was because, from the doorway, I only saw his back.

""Of course, I did what any husband would do in that situation. I shoved the door open and yelled at them. I startled the guy because he quickly turned around.

""That’s when my rage boiled over.

""I finally saw the man’s face, and at first, I thought he was a stranger. But I was wrong. I had met him before—just that morning during the investor meeting.

""The man in bed with my wife was the same man who had sabotaged the deal earlier that day. The potential investor.

""'WHAT THE FUCK? WHY ARE YOU HERE, HUH?' I shouted at him as he scrambled to get off the bed. 'You ruined the deal this morning, got me in trouble with my boss, and now you’re screwing my wife? You son of a bitch!'

""'Soon-to-be-ex-wife!' he shot back. 'Stop acting like you're so great! You're good at nothing!'

""'You’re in my house, goddammit!' I screamed, enraged. 'Don’t act like you own the place!' I ran at him and swung my fist.

""Before I knew it, we were fighting. My wife just sat on the bed, frozen, unsure of what to do.

""During the fight, I managed to grab something from the desk—a metallic statue—and I swung it at him. BAM! I hit his head hard. Blood gushed out, and he collapsed. He wasn’t moving. My wife screamed in horror at the sight.

""My house is pretty big, and the distance between houses in my neighborhood is considerable, so no one would have heard us yelling. But my wife’s scream? That would definitely alert the neighbors. Before she could scream again, I turned around and hurled the metallic statue at her.

""I didn’t aim for her head, but that’s where it landed. She suffered the same fate as her lover—dead from massive blood loss.

""I knew I couldn’t afford to get caught, so I thought fast.

""First, I had to avoid arousing suspicion at work or among my neighbors. I locked the house and rushed back to the office.

""I wrapped up everything I needed to do at work and then returned home in the evening. Once home, I cleaned up the mess. I burned all the clothes and fabrics stained with blood. I scrubbed every trace of blood from the floor and walls. Then, I mutilated their bodies, packed them into a large bag, and waited until after midnight.

""When the neighborhood was silent, I loaded the bag into my car and drove to my late grandparents’ old house on the outskirts of town. Behind their house, there’s a pier that leads to a deep, murky lake. I found the biggest drum in their barn, stuffed the bodies inside, and sealed it with cement.

""Finally, I rolled the drum onto the pier and let it plunge into the lake’s depths.

""I returned home by 4 a.m., just before the neighborhood woke up. Exhausted, I collapsed onto my freshly cleaned bed and fell asleep almost immediately.""

Nicky paused, taking a deep breath, and looked around the room at each of us.

""Well, that’s all,"" he said, spreading his arms wide and smiling ear to ear.

No one reacted. The room was silent. We all sat there, staring at Nicky, each of us silently asking the same question.

This was Liars’ Dinner, a gathering where everyone shared lies. Nicky’s story, like everyone else’s, should have been a lie. But when I glanced at the other members, their faces told me they were thinking the same thing as I was.

Nicky’s story sounded too realistic. Way too realistic. Every detail seemed perfectly placed.

I’d known Nicky since the society's inception. I’d heard every lie he’d ever told, and there were always flaws—details that didn’t add up. But not this time.

I mean, this was a murder, man! A murder! You don’t just make something like that up without cracks in the story. It’s too big, too haunting to be flawless.

Before anyone could react, Nicky stood up, glanced at his watch, and said, ""I’m deeply sorry, guys. It’s been fun, but I have to go now."" He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

""What? Right now? Come on, Nicky, we're not done yet,"" Max tried to keep him in the room.

""Sorry, Max. There's a plane I need to catch,"" Nicky replied.

""A plane? Where are you going?"" Leo asked.

""Manila, Philippines,"" Nicky responded calmly. ""Business trip, for about two weeks. I won’t see you guys for two weeks. Gotta say, that's pretty sad."" Nicky giggled as he explained.

Nicky walked toward the door, with Max following behind.

""See ya, guys,"" he waved at us in the room without even looking back.

Max closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned his back against the door. Everyone in the room remained silent as Max stared at each of us.

""The story Nicky just told us,"" Max spoke slowly, his voice soft, ""was a lie..."" He paused for a moment before continuing with a question.

""...Right?""

Everyone in the room exchanged uneasy glances.

""Well, this is a Liars' society. Rule number one is that everything we say in the room should be a lie,"" Neil answered. But before he could finish, Max cut him off.

""I wasn't asking about the society or the rules,"" Max said. ""I was asking your opinion about Nicky's story.""

""I don’t know, Max. Seriously. I'm not a good liar,"" Randy said. ""But Nicky's story was too convincing. I felt like I was drawn to it.""

""Okay, this is breaking the rules we set for ourselves,"" Danny finally spoke. ""We’re not supposed to discuss whether the other members' stories are truth or lies.""

""Yeah, but we’ve never heard a lie this good in the society before. And it’s Nicky we’re talking about. Even I always noticed some details that were off in his stories,"" Randy commented. ""Also, we all agreed that there’s no such thing as a perfect liar.""

""Well, yeah. But rules are rules, Randy,"" Danny replied.

""Okay, okay. Danny’s right,"" Max said again. ""But one more question..."" He remained leaning on the door.

""Who else here thinks that Nicky isn’t actually coming back?""

No one raised their hand, but from the looks in their eyes, I was sure everyone had the same answer to that question. And for the next thirty minutes, we sat in silence, each lost in our thoughts, pondering the thing we weren’t supposed to discuss.

After the rain and wind stopped, one by one, everyone got up from their seats and walked toward the door. We left without saying a word, but we all had the same thoughts lingering in our minds.

Two days after the gathering, I stopped by a coffee shop near my house after work. Just as I was about to pull out a chair, I heard a familiar voice.

""Lucas Dwell,"" the voice said slowly, ""or whatever your real name is.""

I turned to see Maxwell Duncan—if that was even his real name—sitting at a table next to the one I was about to sit at. Max gestured for me to join him, so I sat across from him.

After a few moments of silence, I couldn’t hold back anymore.

""Okay. This isn’t the society’s room, so I can ask whatever I want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice low. ""Nicky's story was a lie, right?""

""I don’t know, but..."" Max replied immediately, ""what if we ask the question differently?""

""Say he actually killed his wife and her lover,"" Max began. ""Why would he tell us about it? All of us. Six people. We could be witnesses to his confession.""

Max had a point, and I was about to agree when another thought flashed through my mind.

""You know, if he wasn’t a serial killer and only killed them unintentionally, wouldn’t the murder haunt him? I read a few articles about that,"" I said.

""Yeah, I know. So?"" Max responded.

""So, the only way to ease the burden and haunting thoughts is by sharing the story with someone,"" I explained.

""Typically a friend or a psychiatrist, sure. But six people? That doesn’t make sense,"" Max said.

""Exactly. But think about this—have you seen any news about murders matching Nicky’s story?"" I asked. Max froze for a moment before responding.

""I haven’t,"" he admitted. ""I’ve been looking but found nothing.""

""Exactly. And don’t forget he shared the story in the Society of Liars, where everything is supposed to be a lie,"" I continued. ""That’s the rule, but who’s to say some parts weren’t true? Maybe he just added twists and changes to make it seem like a lie.""

""No one can prove if Nicky even has a wife or a job,"" Max added, his excitement growing.

""Or a house,"" I said.

""Maybe..."" I said, ""maybe he did murder someone. Or two. Or three. Who knows?"" I paused. ""But it’s clearly not his wife and her lover.""

""It’s possible he mutilated someone, packed them in a drum, but didn’t throw them into his grandparents’ lake,"" Max suggested. ""Maybe he dumped them in the sea. Or burned them.""

""That’s smart,"" Max said, leaning back in his chair. ""Even if we watched the news, we’d never figure it out.""

""Because we don’t know which parts were true and which were lies,"" I added.

""You think everyone else has figured this out too?"" Max asked.

""Even if they haven’t yet, they eventually will,"" I replied. ""If we can, so can they. And the six of us from that night can tell the story to others who weren’t there.""

""Will it impact the society?"" I asked.

Max stared at the ceiling for a moment before answering. ""Yes,"" he said. ""And the worst-case scenario..."" He paused. ""Everyone might find the game useful and start using it themselves.""

""You mean the other members might murder someone they hate and retell their stories to ease their burden too?"" I asked, not even surprised anymore.

""Yep. And that, Luke,"" Max said, pointing at himself, ""includes me...""

Then he pointed his finger at me.

(26M),"Hey Reddit, I'm (26M) and have never been in a relationship before. I'm currently interested in a woman (26F) who is friends with someone I used to have a crush on.

* **Background:** I had a crush on the other woman for about a year and was friendzoned about six months ago after confessing my feelings. We stopped being friends because it was too painful for me and I needed to move on. I've known my current crush casually for a while (mostly talking about gaming every few months), but we've gotten much closer over the past three weeks.
* **Dating:** We've been on three dates so far (two in a group setting with a mutual female friend) for the last 3 weeks. The more I get to know her, the more I like her. I've been trying to follow advice from friends and family to initiate dates and be more physically affectionate (aiming for hand-holding), but we've only gotten to light hand touches so far.

**Here's what's been bothering me after our recent outings last nights:**

* **Lego Cafe:** We touched hands a lot while searching for Lego pieces in a small box. I didn't sense any discomfort from her.
* **Birthday Dinner:** This was supposed to be a one-on-one date for her birthday, but she invited the same mutual friend. We still had fun, but I was a little disappointed. She insisted on paying for dinner, saying it was her treat because we had given her a present.
* **Coffee:** During this date, the topic of my old crush came up. Apparently, my old crush had discussed the friendzoning situation with my current crush. I reassured her that I have no lingering feelings for my old crush.

**My Questions:**

Because of my past experience with my old crush (a year of unrequited feelings and rejection), I'm worried I might be moving too fast or too slow with my current crush.

* Is one month/four dates enough time to tell her I like her and would like to be more than friends? Or should I continue dating her and try to reach certain ""benchmarks"" like hand-holding and hugging before telling her how I feel?
* Could my history with my old crush be making her hesitant to be with me?
* Are there ways to express my interest and increase our closeness without explicitly telling her I like her yet?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",1,1736646596.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Thanks for visiting my post and I hope I entertained you with my lame title 😀 

About me: I am Sam. 31. Vietnamese. I'm single, never married and I have no kids. I look for a long term relationship. 

I have been living in California for 12+ years and I work as a Nurse Practitioner specialized in Internal Medicine for couple years now. I love my job and I take my pride in what I do (most of the time 😁)

This is how I look: https://ibb.co/528g295   https://ibb.co/MkfpH0D

I like cooking and trying out new recipes. I just mastered how to make the healthy and delicious Céviche perfect for the coming summer. I love cocktails and mixology. Do you like a cold and refreshing Mojito made from fresh lime juice, mint, flavorful rum and sugar for the hot summer days? Or do you fancy a classic, sophisticated and well-balanced Old Fashion for your chill nights? Or do you prefer a modern Cosmopolitan? 

I also collect Vinyl Records. My most favorite activity is listening to my vinyls and enjoying my cocktails. I also like exploring new coffee shops and reading my favorite fantasy books on the weekends. 

I have traveled to several countries mostly in Asia. My next dream is to visit Europe! 

I have a stable career. I am supportive, easy-going, kind of reserved and introverted. I have a healthy lifestyle and I take care of my health and my body. It would be very awesome if we can be gym and motivational partner. I look for someone who is mature, responsible and supportive. 

I am a Catholic but I am not political or conservative. I look for a serious relationship that might lead to marriage. I am okay with doing LDR as long as you intent to meet in real life soon. I am not an expert in reading between the lines, so I really appreciate someone who values clear and open communication. If you decide that I am not the best fit for you, please tell me. If you decide to be MIA for couple days because of life, please tell me.

While we were still in the group, there was a book sale that families could participate in since homeschooling families are bound (heh) to have a lot of extra books they don’t need and could probably use some extra money. My mom didn’t want to sign up for it (it wasn’t mandatory by the way), but she did anyway and we got our books ready for the sale. 

The morning of the book sale, I find my mom in the computer room with her coffee and playing solitaire as usual, and she told me, “Oh, we can’t go to the book sale. I have a migraine.” She had chronic migraines, and it was up to me to know her triggers and be her backup brain if we had to go anywhere. But we weren’t go anywhere that day, so I just piddled around and did my schoolwork as usual. I’ll note that there was an opened box of chocolate glazed Krispy Kreme donuts on the counter. That’ll be important later.

THE moment the book sale was over, my mom found me (she’d been nursing her migraine all day as I remember) and said, “I have something to confess. I ate a donut so we wouldn’t have to go to the book sale.” Sounds pretty bad already, right? WELL. My mom was allergic to chocolate and was pre-diabetic, so the donut not only spiked her sugar to where it shouldn’t have been, but the chocolate also caused the migraine. Like I said, the sale wasn’t mandatory, so I don’t k ow why she didn’t just NOT sign up for it if she didn’t want to go. No. She made herself sick just to get out of it.

1hzbq5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hzbq5b/will_the_world_remember_me_will_they_even/,Will the world remember me? Will they even remember themselves?,"I am writing this in a hurry, please excuse my ramblings. I might not have any other chance. I took another MRI, a now standard monthly check up. Something was definitely wrong. I’d scrutinised the x-ray of my brain every month, so the slight change stood out like a crater in the middle of New York. I’d also x-rayed my family and anyone else I could find around town. I knew what the illness looked like and unfortunately where it led.


Before communication disappeared completely, the internet flooded with chat rooms and forums devoted to teaching ways to identify, manage and record changes in brain health. Most of it was bullshit or unhelpful, but I printed everything I could find. 


A wild storm leaked through our roof and drenched a few boxes holding the print outs before I could save the rest. I don't know what I lost, what I am now missing. There will always be that gap in my understanding now. Could the gap have been filled with a cure? That thought nearly sent me over the edge. My stupidity, dooming the world - all on my own.


I can't explain what it is, why it happened, or where it’s spread. What felt like only a few weeks, the world just - forgot. Alzheimer's, dementia, maybe amnesia - just snuffed out everyone's memories. Left alone and unaffected, I've kept as many alive as I can. I can see them, touch them - try to communicate, but there is no one here. 


I’ve read and watched every survival book or movie I can. But I'm under no threat, no real danger. They smile as I walk past, they might even wave. No roaming bandits to rob and kill me, no starved zombies trying to eat my brain. There are just people here, wind spinning turbines keep the shop lights on and the streets are clean. But I feel stranded, alone among my friends and family, slowly slipping into the darkness.


I have stopped trying to help them, to force them to remember or change. Early on, I would record the days, record everything and play it back to the group every morning. Who knew Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore would give me the most guidance at the end. Like a teacher, I walked and pointed at the screen, trying to force the memories back into their minds. Seeing if anything would ever take hold. 


After my family, and our neighbours, even out towards town, started getting sick I could never leave for any period of time. Leaving would be a disaster. A whole town, unable to communicate, feed and bathe themselves. Even for a day, there would be no one left.


The lost hours here and there have turned to days, a week at its worst. Spoon feeding my high-school English teacher, it felt like I was holding a block of lead. I saw I was shaking, trying to hold the spoon up. I started crying, I didn’t even realise until she started to cry too, a response mechanism, mirroring behaviour like a baby.


It has been almost a year now. There were days where I felt hope for sure. I found my mother one morning, at our old home’s front door. She was trying to get in. I nearly gave her a heart attack with my scream of joy. Jumping up and down I squeezed her so hard. That was it. I stopped to look at her. She had drifted away again.


Across my hands, so many small scars and scratches. It's only natural to lash out when scared, driven by confusion. I understand that. While feeding the town, I have been stabbed, punched and beaten by classmates, their parents, the church pastor, the elderly couple that lived behind our house in the dilapidated but homely cottage. I could kill them all so easily.


I think about the cities, filled with people. Collapsing in on themselves, starving, decaying. If it’s spread this far, they’re probably all gone by now. There might be hope left, in the cities or their hospitals. Maybe there’s still medicine or something that can buy them time. 


Or maybe the cities are doing fine, seeing our town as lost and not worth saving. Have I been alone, stuck in the desert while the rest of the country watches? Do they whisper about it over coffee on their way to work? Once reality sets in, they’ll say it’s just too much trouble to help.


Sometimes I think I am just as dangerous to these people. Their unwilling caretaker, forced to nurture the remains of humanity. If it really is still humanity. I sometimes see these people, my family and neighbours, as animals. I’m the last shepard, hoarding these sick sheep. There are no wolves. Why am I doing this?


There were - urges - I fought for years. Isolation and puberty, what came to feel like my own disease. I won’t say what I have done but just please know that I regret it all, but I can’t apologise. The anger, the frustration and outrage. I wasn't always able to keep it inside, I'm sorry. Please know that I truly never meant to hurt any of them. I think about the people who used to hit their dogs, that unassuming animal that doesn't understand what’s being done. Can I put them down, save them from a certain suffering and death?


I don’t know if I can leave them how I found them. Leaving them to fend for themselves, like a child, alone and confused. You don’t abandon a helpless animal. 


Is not ending it for them now the truly evil option?


But if I do, if I found a cure or worse, find out I was fine, what then? That my thrown together medical understanding has led me wrong and there is nothing to fear. If I end it for them to find out there was no reason to leave.


Will I have doomed them, and cursed myself? Not cursed to deteriorate physically, to have my mind waste away but internally, to fight with what I have done till I may as well have lost my mind, just like the rest of them. 
But if I don't? If I leave them as they are, just with the hope, the hope they do not have the ability to comprehend and I never return. The thoughts of my family, friends, the town I have grown up in, protected, kept alive all these years, to rot away in the dark.


But in the end, will they ever really know? This could just be a scream into nothing. There is no one truly left here and I’m just left to turn off the lights and lock up before leaving.


I’m writing this all down from the front seat of my family's Range Rover. I don’t know how many times I have written this note. I’ve put down a notebook too many times, unable to remember where. I can barely remember starting this note, unsure where these memories have come from. I don't know how long I've been sitting here, or if I will ever leave.

Recently Jay has express that he doesn't like our mutual friend, lets call him Gary (31M). We've known Gary for 4 years, we all meet at the same time during a convention, found out we live close by and have a weekly hangout with a bunch of other guys around our age. We are all good friends but the only ones that I am in contact with and hang out with outside of the group is Jay and Gary.  
My relationship with Jay is okay but rocky at times. We have the normal disagreements most relationships have about cleaning, cooking, boardgame rules etc. But we are good at calmly sitting down and discussing things out, speaking and listening. But some topics have become broken records (story for another post). A couple weeks ago I made plans with Gary to go to an arcade, I hadn't been able to tell Jay yet but knew he wouldn't be able to make it cause he had to work during the time we had planned to go. (If I'm being honest I didn't want him there cause we were having yet another disagreement about cleaning, so I already know I'm the asshole). The night before, during the monthly online gaming sessions Jay and Gary have, Gary mentioned the outing and asked if he was coming too. This interaction obviously hurt Jay's feeling and I feel bad about it to this day.  
When I got back from the outing and Jay got home from work, he was clearly upset. After a few minutes of gently asking him to express what was wrong he told me he actually really doesn't like Gary. He doesn't like his jokes, he doesn't like that Gary pokes fun at him and he hates that I went and spent time alone with him. He admitted he's jealous of Gary's job, and new car. Jay said that in the past he has changed things around last minute to try and make it so that Gary and I don't spend time together alone. He admitted that he know this is an insecurity, and he is both of our friend and that he knows he can't ask me not to spend time with him but he still hated it. Hated that I laughed at his jokes, hated that we hung out alone. He said it didn't help that when we all first started hanging out people thought Gary and I had started dating(Gary was in a long term relationship at the time). But he knows we have never dating and never expressed feeling beyond friendship. But ""he's a guy and guys can't be trusted"", plus Jay was cheated on in the past, so that doesn't help the situation.  
I get that he feels insecure but Gary has been a great friend, he brought me ice cream when my beloved pet passed, helped us move in together, helped my boyfriend build a gaming computer, helped with setting up shelving and other things. Gary and I also have the same kind of dark humor so I do think he is very funny and usually get a solid laugh from his antics. I have never gotten a bad vibe from Gary, sure some of his darker jokes are a bit off but he makes sure to state that he was joking after and even says he has regretted a joke in the moment or that it made him uncomfortable and he wont do that kind of joke again.  
Today, Gary came over for a cup of coffee as he was in the neighborhood and Jay was just about to leave for an appointment, I told Jay he was coming over and I saw him instantly freeze as he mumbled that it was too late to cancel his appointment. I remembered the conversation we had about Gary but was at a loss at what to do and said we should talk about it more when he got back.  
So now I need to know what to do going forward, I don't want to lose Gary as a friend but I don't like that hanging out with him makes my partner uncomfortable. I also don't want to tell Gary that Jay doesn't want us to hang out alone.

1hzbila,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1hzbila/my_husband_drinks_his_coffee_black/,My Husband Drinks His Coffee Black,"It started off just doing small things when we were dating. Honestly, it was a joke - but when I realized how easily he believed me, well, I just couldn't resist.

We were drinking together one night and having the best time. The next morning he woke up hungover. I jokingly said ""When's breakfast?"" He had a confused look on his face. 

""Oh, nevermind. You were drunk when you said you'd make me breakfast in bed."" His face changed, he was pretending to remember.

""I know! Just let me shower quickly."" He rolled out of bed and immediately got into the shower. As I heard the water running, a smile spread across my face.

Then I slowly began escalating over the years. It was honestly all in good fun, I promise. Asking him why he didn't do a chore that was usually mine. 'Reminding' him of certain things he said. He went along with it. Every single time. I was having too much fun. I finally took it a bit further - just to see when he'd finally catch on.

He came home from work one day, there was only about one glass of wine left in the bottle. It was gifted to us, nothing we'd buy ourselves. He asked ""Hunny, do you mind if I finish that wine? I'm sorry, I'll get you some of your usual tomorrow.""

I smiled warmly. ""Of course, go ahead!"" It was exactly how I thought it would go. He poured the glass, left the empty bottle on the counter, and retreated downstairs to his office where he plays video games.

About an hour went by. I knew he'd be coming upstairs for dinner soon. I took the empty wine bottle and hid it inside of grocery bag inside the cleaning closet, behind everything. As I did this, I retrieved the brand new bottle of the exact same wine and put it straight into the freezer so it would look chilled. I continued to cook dinner as usual. After about 20 minutes I pulled the bottle out of the freezer, it was the perfect temperature. I opened the cork as quietly as I could, even though I knew his headset was on. Now obviously I knew it couldn't just be right full - that would be too obvious. I began to chug the wine straight out of the bottle and I was definitely tipsy. Then I poured myself a glass of wine, and left the bottle with about half a glass of wine on the counter. Exactly where he left the empty bottle.

I finished plating dinner and heard him come up the stairs. I became giddy, I couldn't wait to see if he would finally catch on to me. He approached me and gave me a kiss. He looked down at the wine glass in my hand, absolutely puzzled. ""Did you get more wine?"" 

""No? You asked if you could have half of what was left and left the rest for me. I wanted to leave you a little bit though,"" I gestured to the almost completely empty wine bottle, ""I know you had a long day at work."" He was bewildered, I almost couldn't contain myself. 

""I swear I finished th..."" He trailed off still looking at the bottle.

""Hmmm?"" I said. He just shook his head and blinked a few times.

""Nothing, I guess I did have a long day. Thank you hunny."" He smiled and kissed me again. I smiled back. This is exactly what I wanted.

About a month passed, I couldn't do things too closely together. That might raise suspicion and I couldn't have that. It was early morning on Friday, he was going on a business trip today and would return home on Sunday. I make coffee for my husband every single morning, I always loved to do it for him. For as long as I've known him he drank his coffee black, always teasing me for putting sugar in mine.

I slowly dumped the vile I had hidden in my pocket into his cup of coffee and stirred it in. He came to the kitchen, grabbed the coffee from me and gave me a big kiss. ""Thanks hunny."" I smiled and turned back to the coffee maker. How stupid did he think I was? I knew exactly what this 'business trip' was. I found his dirty little messages with that woman a few months ago. 

He took a sip of his coffee and made a face. ""Did you put sugar in this?"" He asked.

""Yes.. sorry did I put too much?"" I asked innocently.

""I don't like sugar in my coffee."" 

""What are you talking about? You always take a teaspoon of sugar in your coffee."" I stated. ""I'm sorry, let me remake it for you."" I reached for the mug and he pulled it closer to himself. I did it, I think I finally drove him crazy enough to question every aspect of himself.

""No, I'm sorry."" He smiled, but it was fake. I smiled back as he drank the coffee. He grabbed his briefcase once he was finished. Kissed me on the cheek and said he'd see me in a couple days.

I know he doesn't like his coffee sweet - but that's not my concern anymore.

Hello!! First time poster here and apologies in advance, this one might be a bit long!

The TLDR version: I'm supposed to fly 18+ hours to Orlando next Saturday for a work trip but I'm so anxious and terrified that I'm considering cancelling. 

The trip to get there is 2 flights, the 1st is 15 hours and then 3 hours. I've done this trip twice before, but here is where my anxiety really kicks in - the first time I flew Aus to US (in 2022), I had a really terrifying situation. About 2 hours into the flight my pulse went up to 180 and I blacked out. I woke up pretty quickly, but for the rest of the flight my heart was pounding at 120, I felt so sick and was stuck in a panic attack for 12 hours. This was my first long haul flight experience and the carrier I fly with doesnt have WIFI on board! 

When I got back home after my trip, I got my heart checked and everything, and for the most part things came back normal. My doctor put it down to a combination of anxiety, stress and a reaction to the coffee i had before the flight (pretty silly of me but I had no idea it'd cause a reaction!).

Since then my heart has been relatively fine, however, every flight I've been on since my pulse has been moderately elevated between 85 - 115 bpm all flight. I have a few things in place to cope but my pulse never calms down below 85 - I avoid any stimulants in the lead up to flights, a beta blocker (which im yet to use), I have noise cancelling headphones, breathing / meditation tapes, and have done Cognitive behavioral therapy to help with this anxiety.

Aside from the heart anxiety, I really fear that particular route. I'm really claustrophobic, and hate being stuck in situations I can't escape and so the path being 15 hours over the ocean terrifies me. My brain goes to the worst possible scenario of ""what ifs"" and its worse thinking that there is no where to land in the case of an emergency. Then there's the fact that I've got to do it again on the way back - the trip is only a 6 days so a short turn around between those flights and the idea of 30 hours over the ocean in a plane is anxiety inducing. 

Then finally, I'm worried about the state the US is currently in - I'm supposed to be flying out of LAX and with all the tragic fires at the moment, I'm afraid of delays/ cancellations etc and being stuck there, unable to escape. 

I know all of these concerns are probably ridiculous but I'm really considering cancelling the work trip. I don't really feel like I need to be there, as its just a 2 day conference. but my whole team and the wider organisation are getting together for the trip so I don't know if it would look bad if I don't go. I just don't think I can get on that plane.",1,1736645384.0,fearofflying,2,1.0,False

When I do, it’s only to see nonjudgmental friends one-on-one. I avoid public places like coffee shops, bars, or events with young people (I’m F31). Although I used to do these things, even masked, I stopped 1–1.5 years ago because the harassment became constant.

Today, I took the bus to visit a friend and sat where I felt less visible. A group of about 10 men in their 20s came on. I avoided eye contact and focused on my phone, hoping to avoid trouble. They started saying, “Come on, ask her what’s wrong with her,” mocking me with, “Do you have corona, eh?” and sarcastically, “Poor you.” They kept pressing me to explain the mask. I finally said, “I don’t want to talk to you,” and switched seats, but the bus was crowded. They mocked my appearance and made remarks like, “Her mommy probably didn’t let her play outside,” which is absurd at 31. A lot of people on the bus saw and heard it, but no one stepped in. I know those are stupid, childish men, but since it happens almost everytime i leave the house it gets to me. Who know maybe next time harassment might not stop at words.

I’m shocked and traumatized this keeps happening. It’s regular and seems to be getting worse. Does this happen to you often? How do you handle it in the moment and emotionally? I feel like I need to toughen up, but this time was hard, especially since it was so public and I was alone. My boyfriend also wears a mask but rarely gets this reaction.

I met this woman 6 years younger than I am and who has been dating for a few years, 2.5 weeks ago.  We immediately connected and went out 3 times for coffee and a short hike.  She had guests from Christmas till New Years and she fell sick after they left.  I invited her over to my place so I could take care of her.  She accepted and I took care of her (cooked meals, tea, etc) while she was in my house in a separate bedroom.  Things were going well, or so I thought.

On Friday morning, I asked if she was free that evening and want to hang out.  She asks what I wanted to do.   Conversation/texts went like this.  
Me: I am up for anything.  If you are busy, that fine.  No pressure. 

Her: What would that anything be?.

Me: What do YOU want to do? 

Her: Give me some ideas to pick from.

Me: I don't specifically know what you like to do.  Why don't you give me some ideas and we can do that.

Her: I forgot that I am meeting a friend tonight. Let me check and get back. 

Her: Also, what you wanna do is nothing.. it is about creativity and the effort you put.  

  
I did not text her back and she did not either.   I get a feeling like she has high demands and I would never meet those in her eyes.  I was being nice and asked her what she wud like to do, maybe that was my mistake.  I got out a 17 yr marriage where I was expected to read my ex's mind to this woman who's expecting me to read her mind.  I understand some woman prefer men to take charge and make plans, but sending a ""list"" for her to pick from, that's a bit much I thought.

1hzbewh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/comments/1hzbewh/hiring_album_art_for_musical_about_norse/,[HIRING] Album Art for Musical about Norse Mythology. $500+ USD,"Hey everybody!

I have co-written a rock musical based on some of the sagas from Nordic mythology, titled ""In Odin's Name."" I am currently recording an album for the musical, and am approaching the final stages. That means I'll need some artwork!

Even though the main distribution will be via streaming and download services (which only requires a front cover) I do plan on doing a small limited physical release in my local area, which means I'm going to need designs and/or art for both the back cover and the inside gatefold as well. So that means the front cover has to work for streaming services like Spotify, as well as potentially blown up to fit on a full LP vinyl cover.

The front cover will feature a rendition of the main character, Odin, with the text ""In Odin's Name"" featured as well over a black background (so bonus points if you're into typography as well). The back cover and inside gatefold will have text with everything from track listing to musician credits to copyright notices, so the design and art of those must service the needs of that text, as well as stylistically aligning with the front cover - I'll love to hear what ideas you have for this, and minimalism is good too!

I am looking for a particular style in mind - I'm not sure this style has a name, but its kind of the flat-color Tarot card look. I am a huge fan of Abigail Larson - [like here!](https://gallerynucleus.com/artists/abigail_larson?category=prints) - as well as IrenHorror's work - like [this](https://www.deviantart.com/irenhorrors/art/Gullveig-852398285) and [this](https://www.deviantart.com/irenhorrors/art/Skadi-786334976) - so something in that vein. Also a fan of some of ChrissaBug's work and [Yliade's](https://www.deviantart.com/yliade/art/Asteria-Greek-Mythology-830454357). I want to avoid the anime look - I want to make that clear since most the art I see here is in that vein. I also want to have absolutely no relation to anything Marvel or MCU - ideally I want as original an interpretation as possible.

This is obviously a commercial request, since this artwork will be used on music that is to be sold, as well as to be featured on merch related to the musical, like posters, t-shirts, and hell, coffee mugs if there's a demand! I did say $500 USD in the title, but this is not a hard limit, and I'm willing to negotiate with the right artist.

**BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!** Budget depending, I want to make art for all the characters in the musical in the same style that Odin is depicted on the front cover. These would be featured in a small booklet that I'd like to include in the physical release for the album, as well as possible merch as well. And hey! Maybe you might want to include one of the other characters on the back cover, as a sort of ying to Odin's yang (like Njord or Loki or something). But anyway, I want to count these character depictions as a separate commission and it'll be something we'll want to talk about later, but definitely keep it in mind that there's the potential for more work.

I have a Gaggia Classic pro with a PID mod. The PID is installed by a Gaggia hobbyist. I never touched the temperature setting on the PID.

I changed to temp again to 96C on my PID which gave me an outcome temp of 76C. Another big difference. 
I've read that measuring the temp of the water outcome from the shower will  never give you a good real measurement because of the water flow. But is such a big difference normal? It 20C difference!?? ",1,1736645038.0,gaggiaclassic,1,1.0,False

1hzb7wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1hzb7wy/one_night_at_the_society_of_liars/,One Night at the Society of Liars,"You know, in this day and age, everything has its own society, community, or forum—whether offline or online. Even the strange and nonsensical ones.

Have you ever heard about a bunch of kids taking pictures with DSLR lens caps? Yeah, very specific—the lens caps. That falls into the ""doesn't-make-sense"" category for me, and yet, it has its own societies and communities in different cities.

Welcome to millennial! Yay!

Now, if you think about it, it wouldn't be odd to find that almost everything else has its own society, community, or forum.

Take liars, for example.

Yeah, liars—people who tell lies. They have their own society too. I mean, why not? Especially when you're in the habit of lying, constantly telling lies, and want a safe space to do it without hurting your family or loved ones. It’s much easier to lie to a group of people who already know you’re lying than to deceive the people who truly matter to you.

I was once a part of this Society of Liars.

Once.

Like any other society, the Society of Liars I’m talking about had a name. It was called Liar’s Dinner, because it was held once a week at night, where we shared lies over dinner and snacks. Pretty much like any other gathering, except for one key rule: everything we said was a lie. Every single thing.

And all the members of the gathering must react and respond as if the story is real, no matter how badly the lies are told by other members.

There are many reasons why people tell lies.

The most common is to avoid trouble—truth gets you into trouble, so you lie. Others lie because they’re manipulators; they enjoy controlling situations and people. But the most fascinating liars, in my opinion, are the dreamers—the ones who wish they could do something they never could, so they lie about it. They lie about being great at something, just to feel the thrill of admiration. It gives them the same satisfaction as a successful person bragging about their achievements.

The difference is, it’s all a lie.

When people believe them, they feel like their worth skyrockets—like they’ve ascended to a higher level of respect or quality.

But in reality, they haven’t.

As seasoned liars, most of us could spot the difference between truth and lies, no matter how well-disguised. Some lies are obvious, even to a child.

Take Danny Allman, for example—a short, chubby, awkward guy and a terrible liar. His lies were so bad, they were almost entertaining. He’d spin the same stories over and over, about robbing banks or hooking up with supermodels. You didn’t need a Ph.D. in psychology to know he was lying.

Then there are lies that only experts can debunk. Like if someone claims to have robbed a bank but gets the details wrong, someone with experience would catch it immediately.

A lie is a lie—it didn’t happen. And if you’ve lived with lies long enough, you can always tell the difference.

But have I ever met someone who told a lie so convincing that it sounded like the truth? A story where every detail matched, down to the tiniest nuance?

Yes, I have.

Do I think they were lying or telling the truth?

Well, you tell me.

It was the 57th Liar’s Dinner gathering. Only seven out of 24 members showed up—it was a cold and rainy night.

One of the Society of Liars’ core rules was anonymity. No one knew anyone’s real identity. We all used fake names, and no personal details were shared when we joined. The only things we knew about each other were our faces, fake names, and the lies we told.

My name in the society was Lucas Dwell—Luke for short.

I ran from the parking lot to the building to avoid the rain, knocked on the door, and was greeted by Max.

“Yo, Luke! Our Liar of the Month is here!” Max exclaimed, grinning. “How’s your day, mate?”

“Terrible, as always. Everything went horribly wrong today,” I replied, stepping inside. In the Liar’s Dinner, the moment you entered the room, everything you said had to be a lie.

“Wow, that’s sad,” Max said with a chuckle, handing me a cup of warm coffee.

The others—Danny, Lionel, Neil, and Randall—were already there. Shortly after, Nicholas arrived, making it seven of us.

Max started the meeting, and we all took turns telling our lies. Danny kicked things off with his usual nonsense—crime sprees and supermodels. Predictable. Lionel tried something new, claiming he’d hooked up with a famous actress. Close, but the details didn’t quite add up. Neil and Randall teamed up, boasting about launching a startup that became wildly successful in just three months. Too good to be true.

Finally, it was Nicholas’ turn. Usually, he’d launch straight into tales of glamour and luxury. But that night was different.

He sat there, scanning the room, a strange smile on his face.

“Well,” he began, “this week, I experienced something I’ve never experienced before. Something extreme.”

He paused, letting the silence build.

“I murdered someone.”

The room fell silent, everyone staring at him in disbelief.

Throughout 57 meetups with 24 members, no one ever told a story—or a lie—about murdering someone. Some members did share stories about doing horrible things to people they hated, like their bosses or their bullies, but never a murder.

""Wow! This is new!"" Max exclaimed from the back, as excited as ever, clapping his hands slowly. ""Go on!""

""It actually happened three days ago,"" Nicky began his story. ""The day started out like every other day. I woke up in the morning, had breakfast, and kissed my wife goodbye before heading to work."" Unlike the way he had opened his session earlier, his voice softened as he started his story.

""So, I did my job as best as I could at the office, just like I always do. However, unlike every other day, it turned out to be the worst day ever. That morning, I had a meeting with a potential investor for the company I work for. I’ve never had a problem dealing with third parties before—whether they were future clients or investors—but this one guy I met that morning was really tough. He asked me questions, and I answered, but no matter what I said, he always had a counterargument. It was as if everything I said was wrong.

""You know, it wasn’t the first time I talked to potential investors. I’ve been doing this for years. Most of the questions they ask are predictable, and I know the answers by heart. So, I started to think that this guy was intentionally giving me a hard time.

""And I didn’t know why.

""Long story short, the deal fell through. It was a complete failure. My boss had warned me beforehand that this deal was huge, so if I failed, I’d be in trouble.

""And I was.

""When I got back to the office, I had to endure the full wrath of my boss. My day was officially ruined. And it didn’t stop there—it got worse. Just as my boss was done yelling at me, he reminded me of another meeting in the afternoon. That’s when I realized I’d forgotten to bring the files he needed for the meeting.

""I couldn’t afford more trouble, so I sneaked out of the office and drove home. My plan was simple: grab the files and get back before my boss noticed I was gone.

""But when I got home, I heard noises coming from my bedroom. It was my wife, moaning with pleasure. I walked toward the doorway. It wasn’t closed, so I could see everything clearly—my wife in the middle of having sex with another man.

""I didn’t know who he was because, from the doorway, I only saw his back.

""Of course, I did what any husband would do in that situation. I shoved the door open and yelled at them. I startled the guy because he quickly turned around.

""That’s when my rage boiled over.

""I finally saw the man’s face, and at first, I thought he was a stranger. But I was wrong. I had met him before—just that morning during the investor meeting.

""The man in bed with my wife was the same man who had sabotaged the deal earlier that day. The potential investor.

""'WHAT THE FUCK? WHY ARE YOU HERE, HUH?' I shouted at him as he scrambled to get off the bed. 'You ruined the deal this morning, got me in trouble with my boss, and now you’re screwing my wife? You son of a bitch!'

""'Soon-to-be-ex-wife!' he shot back. 'Stop acting like you're so great! You're good at nothing!'

""'You’re in my house, goddammit!' I screamed, enraged. 'Don’t act like you own the place!' I ran at him and swung my fist.

""Before I knew it, we were fighting. My wife just sat on the bed, frozen, unsure of what to do.

""During the fight, I managed to grab something from the desk—a metallic statue—and I swung it at him. BAM! I hit his head hard. Blood gushed out, and he collapsed. He wasn’t moving. My wife screamed in horror at the sight.

""My house is pretty big, and the distance between houses in my neighborhood is considerable, so no one would have heard us yelling. But my wife’s scream? That would definitely alert the neighbors. Before she could scream again, I turned around and hurled the metallic statue at her.

""I didn’t aim for her head, but that’s where it landed. She suffered the same fate as her lover—dead from massive blood loss.

""I knew I couldn’t afford to get caught, so I thought fast.

""First, I had to avoid arousing suspicion at work or among my neighbors. I locked the house and rushed back to the office.

""I wrapped up everything I needed to do at work and then returned home in the evening. Once home, I cleaned up the mess. I burned all the clothes and fabrics stained with blood. I scrubbed every trace of blood from the floor and walls. Then, I mutilated their bodies, packed them into a large bag, and waited until after midnight.

""When the neighborhood was silent, I loaded the bag into my car and drove to my late grandparents’ old house on the outskirts of town. Behind their house, there’s a pier that leads to a deep, murky lake. I found the biggest drum in their barn, stuffed the bodies inside, and sealed it with cement.

""Finally, I rolled the drum onto the pier and let it plunge into the lake’s depths.

""I returned home by 4 a.m., just before the neighborhood woke up. Exhausted, I collapsed onto my freshly cleaned bed and fell asleep almost immediately.""

Nicky paused, taking a deep breath, and looked around the room at each of us.

""Well, that’s all,"" he said, spreading his arms wide and smiling ear to ear.

No one reacted. The room was silent. We all sat there, staring at Nicky, each of us silently asking the same question.

This was Liars’ Dinner, a gathering where everyone shared lies. Nicky’s story, like everyone else’s, should have been a lie. But when I glanced at the other members, their faces told me they were thinking the same thing as I was.

Nicky’s story sounded too realistic. Way too realistic. Every detail seemed perfectly placed.

I’d known Nicky since the society's inception. I’d heard every lie he’d ever told, and there were always flaws—details that didn’t add up. But not this time.

I mean, this was a murder, man! A murder! You don’t just make something like that up without cracks in the story. It’s too big, too haunting to be flawless.

Before anyone could react, Nicky stood up, glanced at his watch, and said, ""I’m deeply sorry, guys. It’s been fun, but I have to go now."" He grabbed his coat and headed for the door.

""What? Right now? Come on, Nicky, we're not done yet,"" Max tried to keep him in the room.

""Sorry, Max. There's a plane I need to catch,"" Nicky replied.

""A plane? Where are you going?"" Leo asked.

""Manila, Philippines,"" Nicky responded calmly. ""Business trip, for about two weeks. I won’t see you guys for two weeks. Gotta say, that's pretty sad."" Nicky giggled as he explained.

Nicky walked toward the door, with Max following behind.

""See ya, guys,"" he waved at us in the room without even looking back.

Max closed the door and locked it. He then turned around and leaned his back against the door. Everyone in the room remained silent as Max stared at each of us.

""The story Nicky just told us,"" Max spoke slowly, his voice soft, ""was a lie..."" He paused for a moment before continuing with a question.

""...Right?""

Everyone in the room exchanged uneasy glances.

""Well, this is a Liars' society. Rule number one is that everything we say in the room should be a lie,"" Neil answered. But before he could finish, Max cut him off.

""I wasn't asking about the society or the rules,"" Max said. ""I was asking your opinion about Nicky's story.""

""I don’t know, Max. Seriously. I'm not a good liar,"" Randy said. ""But Nicky's story was too convincing. I felt like I was drawn to it.""

""Okay, this is breaking the rules we set for ourselves,"" Danny finally spoke. ""We’re not supposed to discuss whether the other members' stories are truth or lies.""

""Yeah, but we’ve never heard a lie this good in the society before. And it’s Nicky we’re talking about. Even I always noticed some details that were off in his stories,"" Randy commented. ""Also, we all agreed that there’s no such thing as a perfect liar.""

""Well, yeah. But rules are rules, Randy,"" Danny replied.

""Okay, okay. Danny’s right,"" Max said again. ""But one more question..."" He remained leaning on the door.

""Who else here thinks that Nicky isn’t actually coming back?""

No one raised their hand, but from the looks in their eyes, I was sure everyone had the same answer to that question. And for the next thirty minutes, we sat in silence, each lost in our thoughts, pondering the thing we weren’t supposed to discuss.

After the rain and wind stopped, one by one, everyone got up from their seats and walked toward the door. We left without saying a word, but we all had the same thoughts lingering in our minds.

Two days after the gathering, I stopped by a coffee shop near my house after work. Just as I was about to pull out a chair, I heard a familiar voice.

""Lucas Dwell,"" the voice said slowly, ""or whatever your real name is.""

I turned to see Maxwell Duncan—if that was even his real name—sitting at a table next to the one I was about to sit at. Max gestured for me to join him, so I sat across from him.

After a few moments of silence, I couldn’t hold back anymore.

""Okay. This isn’t the society’s room, so I can ask whatever I want,"" I said, trying to keep my voice low. ""Nicky's story was a lie, right?""

""I don’t know, but..."" Max replied immediately, ""what if we ask the question differently?""

""Say he actually killed his wife and her lover,"" Max began. ""Why would he tell us about it? All of us. Six people. We could be witnesses to his confession.""

Max had a point, and I was about to agree when another thought flashed through my mind.

""You know, if he wasn’t a serial killer and only killed them unintentionally, wouldn’t the murder haunt him? I read a few articles about that,"" I said.

""Yeah, I know. So?"" Max responded.

""So, the only way to ease the burden and haunting thoughts is by sharing the story with someone,"" I explained.

""Typically a friend or a psychiatrist, sure. But six people? That doesn’t make sense,"" Max said.

""Exactly. But think about this—have you seen any news about murders matching Nicky’s story?"" I asked. Max froze for a moment before responding.

""I haven’t,"" he admitted. ""I’ve been looking but found nothing.""

""Exactly. And don’t forget he shared the story in the Society of Liars, where everything is supposed to be a lie,"" I continued. ""That’s the rule, but who’s to say some parts weren’t true? Maybe he just added twists and changes to make it seem like a lie.""

""No one can prove if Nicky even has a wife or a job,"" Max added, his excitement growing.

""Or a house,"" I said.

""Maybe..."" I said, ""maybe he did murder someone. Or two. Or three. Who knows?"" I paused. ""But it’s clearly not his wife and her lover.""

""It’s possible he mutilated someone, packed them in a drum, but didn’t throw them into his grandparents’ lake,"" Max suggested. ""Maybe he dumped them in the sea. Or burned them.""

""That’s smart,"" Max said, leaning back in his chair. ""Even if we watched the news, we’d never figure it out.""

""Because we don’t know which parts were true and which were lies,"" I added.

""You think everyone else has figured this out too?"" Max asked.

""Even if they haven’t yet, they eventually will,"" I replied. ""If we can, so can they. And the six of us from that night can tell the story to others who weren’t there.""

""Will it impact the society?"" I asked.

Max stared at the ceiling for a moment before answering. ""Yes,"" he said. ""And the worst-case scenario..."" He paused. ""Everyone might find the game useful and start using it themselves.""

""You mean the other members might murder someone they hate and retell their stories to ease their burden too?"" I asked, not even surprised anymore.

""Yep. And that, Luke,"" Max said, pointing at himself, ""includes me...""

Then he pointed his finger at me.

The case has been unsolved for now 36 years but police have always had Frederick down as a suspect. He was married to the victims best friend, and matched the build and psychological profile of the offender, but it wasn’t enough to pursue charges. Well after 36 years it seems there will finally be some closure.

Earlier this year police restarted the case against Frederick, questioning him about his whereabouts the night, and attaining DNA off a coffee cup. The DNA matched semen off a pair of underwear from the rape. On December 11th, Frederick was arrested, and indicted on December 20th by a jury for rape and lying and providing false documentation to law enforcement. Frederick is a licensed doctor at Hutchinson regional medical center, where he has been accused by 2 woman of sexual assault in the last 3 years. Both of Frederick’s ex wives have accused him of drugging and raping them during their marriages, it’s possible this gets further investigated with the upcoming trial. Frederick is being held in jail without bail, as police believe he has the money to flee before trial.

Cheers to another one solved.

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I’m not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I’m not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health

* [This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

1. I’ve never had to deal with the issue of unwanted male attention - I was out to my friends by middle school and most people could always tell (lol), I was never conventionally attractive, growing up I was dealing with a lot of untreated social anxiety and I was generally kinda weird, so I’m totally new to this situation and I desperately need an Elder Lesbian to tell me what the hell is going on because I’m scared I’m totally misreading the situation.

2. Most of the friendships throughout my life were with men (straight and gay). I’ve been really lucky that all of them have been wonderful friends that respect me and I’ve never had to deal with any weird behavior from them.

So, when this guy started chatting with me before class, sitting next to me, etc., I was acting like I always do. We have some interests in common and I appreciated the fact that he was one of the few people in that class that, like me, joined the discussions so I asked if he wanted to do the final project together. I think that was the moment he started acting weird. 

It’s nothing major but it’s stuff that’s starting to make me really uncomfortable in his presence and I feel like I’m reverting into an anxious version of myself and going into something akin to fawning? I’m usually pretty confident now and don’t have an issue with dealing with people, but I genuinely, genuinely don’t know if I’m reading this right. He keeps staring at me, he keeps getting into my personal space, one day he walked me to my car despite me already saying bye to him and went in for a hug (I just waved and got in). We met up at a cafe to work on the project and he wanted to pay for my coffee (I told him to pay for his own and I’ll pay for mine). Then he proceeded to talk at me for 2 hours, we got nothing done and I felt like Barbie in the campfire scene. Then he walked me to the bus stop despite me saying I can go myself and hugged me. I genuinely had to sit in my room in the dark after that situation to unwind. 

I have never given him any cues that I was interested in that way, I just acted like a normal human person trying to be nice to a classmate and maybe get a new casual friend, and I’m rather reserved with other people at first either way. Is what I think is happening really happening and what do I even do with that? I live in a rather conservative country so I’m not comfortable with telling him outright that I’m gay, especially that he’s mentioned he’s very involved in church during that last meeting.",11,1736643623.0,actuallesbians,6,0.92,False

1hzaubi,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1hzaubi/are_we_moving_too_fast/,Are we moving too fast? ,"TLDR: My mom thinks I’m moving too fast with the guy I’m dating. But the pace just feels natural. We aren’t rushing each other and just going with what feels easy and natural. Is my mom right or are we just lucky?

I (24f) met a guy (23m, let’s call him Craig) on Bumble and pretty much immediately he asked me out on a date. We went out for coffee last Sunday and talked for hours and hours. It was absolutely incredible. The conversation flowed effortlessly and he is everything that I’ve been looking for in a partner and there was an instant spark. We made plans to go out again this weekend. 

Over the past week we’ve been talking constantly over text and on the phone. We both were honest and agreed that we don’t want to see anyone else and we would like to be exclusive. He ended up asking me to be his girlfriend to which I said yes. However, a lot of my family and some friends think that it is moving too fast. They think that it’s just puppy love and it’ll fizzle out and they don’t see that it’s gonna go anywhere. 

Craig and I have had extensive conversations about what we want in our relationship. Very serious and in depth discussions about our expectations of the other person as well as ourselves. We’ve both opened up about our past and our trauma, and how we are trying to heal from it, and we both want to support each other on that journey, in whatever ways we can. He makes me feel safe and understood. Which is saying a lot for me. 

My mom was initially excited and even asked if I could invite him over to her house for dinner so she could meet him this Sunday (what would be our second date. It was fully her idea. We were supposed to do something else entirely) but Craig was excited to meet her and agreed to it. But I told a friend of mine that Craig had asked me to be his girlfriend and that we were exclusive and she somehow let it slip to my mom and now when I talk about him to my mom, she rolls her eyes and says I’m jumping in way too fast. She asks how can we possibly know what we want after only having one date. I kind of brushed it off but it got me worrying. 

I don’t know what to do because I really like Craig not only is he’s amazing and every thing I’ve ever wanted in a partner but he makes me feel safe. I can finally turn my overthinking brain off and simply be ME. I try to tell my mom that I know I want to be with him not just because of how amazing he is but because simply talking to him or being in his presence I feel worthy. I feel save and protected and supported. She says I don’t even know him and while yes we’re still learning about each other we do know a lot about each other. The conversations actually matter and we’ve been honest about any flaws we may have and are very accepting of the each other. We talk about superficial stuff like our day at work or what our favorite movies are (generic beginning of relationship topics) but also deep personal stuff like our traumas with our fathers and what we want in life etc. We’ve both been very open and honest about what we want and expect and we both agreed that we want to build a very strong relationship. And it’s not like we’re getting married tomorrow etc. We literally just communicated honestly about committing our time and energy exclusively to each other and want to see what the future holds.
