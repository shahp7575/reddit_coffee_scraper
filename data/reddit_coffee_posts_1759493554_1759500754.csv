I recently returned from Japan and I picked up a bit of an addiction while I was there: the Opera Cosmetics Glow Lip Tints. I got shades 310 (Tea Brown) and 304 (Mauve I think?) and oh my gosh, I have never used a lip tint that was simultaneously so comfortable on my lips but also actually leaves a nice tint for a long time. Seriously, the color has been lasting through my morning coffees and snacks at work better than many other lipsticks I've used. Tea Brown is also just such a nice color for fall!

I'm already dreading running out of them. Is there anywhere in the US that sells Opera Cosmetics, or if not, does anyone know of a lip tint that is this good?",0,1759500003.0,AsianBeauty,1,0.5,False

1nwzq2s,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1nwzq2s/tales_of_a_hotel_actech_part_two_the_dwarf/,Tales of a Hotel AC-Tech -Part two - The dwarf,"    After that night, I made two decisions. 
    First, never follow the Knocks when you‚Äôre in a hurry. That one was easy. 
    The second? Maybe less so. I told myself I‚Äôd start exploring. Lean into it. See where the tunnels go. Try to map this hidden world beneath the city. Looking back now‚Ä¶ those might not have been the smartest choices. But something had shifted. And honestly, part of me wanted to know why I kept ending up in places I didn‚Äôt recognize. Or worse, recognizing places I‚Äôd never been. 
    
    I don‚Äôt know if this happens to other people. Maybe it‚Äôs just me. Some undiagnosed brain quirk. A miswired filter. But in crowded spaces, my mind goes into overdrive, searching for signals meant for me. A familiar voice. My name. Just‚Ä¶ anything that stands out in the noise. Most of the time, it‚Äôs nothing. Just echoes of expectation. And when it‚Äôs totally silent? It‚Äôs like my brain fills in the blanks. A little hum in one ear turns into whispering. The wind between ducts starts shaping into words. I know it‚Äôs probably just mental noise. Probably. 
    
    One morning, I was outside the back entrance of one of our hotels. Barely awake. Hair a mess. Coffee in one hand, cigarette in the other. A paper cup and five hours of sleep holding me together. Then hotel security approached me. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed them calling out for me. Maybe I just assumed it was my imagination. I told them I was maintenance. They looked me over and said they‚Äôd thought I was a homeless guy trying to sneak into the underground garage. Apparently, two had already managed to that same night. I told them I‚Äôd keep an eye out while I checked the sub-levels. But all I could think was: who else is down there? Because not all the people in those tunnels are ghosts. Some of them still breathe. 
    
    So I finished my coffee started my shift. No squatters in sight, though the security guy passed me once on his way down and again on his way back up. Empty-handed both times. I overheard him muttering something under his breath, something like, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not even human at this point‚Ä¶ just parasites.‚Äù 
    
    That kind of misanthropy really gets under my skin. I‚Äôve always believed that no matter how far someone‚Äôs fallen, they still deserve compassion. Life can chew you up in a hundred ways, and for some people, there‚Äôs no safety net when it does. Still, I‚Äôll be honest, I understand where that bitterness comes from, even if I don‚Äôt agree with it. I‚Äôve heard the stories: junkies or drifters scaring off guests, trashing equipment, defiling HVAC rooms, sometimes even lashing out violently. It makes people afraid. And fear curdles fast into hate. I like to think I‚Äôd help if I could, but truthfully? I‚Äôm not exactly in the financial position to play savior. So most days, I just nod politely‚Ä¶ and pretend not to see. 
    
    That morning, though, none of it stopped me from making my usual offering to the Knockers. Just a protein bar this time, left on a stack of rusted ductwork near an unused junction box. Then, without much of a plan, I decided to explore. Behind that half-collapsed shelf, hidden like an afterthought, was a breakthrough, just a rough opening punched into the brickwork, leading into what had to be another hotel‚Äôs cellar. It wasn‚Äôt on any plan I‚Äôd seen, but it had clearly been there a while. Just inside, I found a ladder. Steel rungs rusted to the bone, bolted into the wall of a shaft that dropped into darkness deeper than my flashlight could reach. 
    
    And yeah, I climbed down. Not because I was looking to get lost again. Quite the opposite. I‚Äôve already been lost down here, stumbled through too many corridors I couldn‚Äôt retrace, and that‚Äôs not a feeling I ever want to repeat. The way I see it, the more routes I know, the more exits I‚Äôve seen, the more turns I can anticipate, the better chance I have if it ever happens again. It‚Äôs about familiarity. About turning the unknown into something navigable. So I went. One rung at a time, one more map in my head. 
    
    I decided to try the old labyrinth trick, always take right turns. It‚Äôs not foolproof, but in a place like this, it‚Äôs better than wandering blind. This area was clearly abandoned. No lights. Just my flashlight casting shaky shadows through dust thick enough to muffle footsteps. Cobwebs laced the corners. Pipes and conduit hung half-torn from walls like exposed tendons. The silence wasn‚Äôt peaceful, it pressed. Heavy. Like the air itself wanted me to turn around. 
    
    Then I saw something I‚Äôd missed at first. Footprints. Bare ones. Large. Pressed into the dust ahead of me, not where I was going, but where I had gone. I wasn‚Äôt following them‚Ä¶ but whoever left them seemed to have walked the same path I was taking. They vanished just as the corridor opened up into a crawl room, one intentionally half choked with insulation, dirt, and debris. Machinery lay half-buried and half-rotted. Getting to some of it would‚Äôve meant crawling through slush and shredded fiberglass on my belly. No thanks, not without a reason. In one dusty compartment just off the main room, I found a camp. Someone had wedged themselves into a dry-ish corner beside a cracked pipe trickling cold water. Between the mildew and trash, the stench was sour and grim. It wasn‚Äôt exactly a five-star setup, but I could see the logic. Shelter. Running water. Privacy. There was a moldy pillow. A trash bag. A candle melted into a stone. A couple torn snack wrappers scattered around like dead leaves. Someone had been here, and not long ago.
    
    And then, there were the noises. At first, the usual background hum: running water, far-off motors, air moving through broken ducts. But beneath that, something else. Something almost vocal. Like someone whispering in the static, right on the edge of comprehension. I couldn‚Äôt make out words. But I knew they were there. Somewhere between the echoes and the wires. 
    
    By now, I‚Äôd been down there for maybe an hour and a half, not that it felt like it. Walking those tunnels on my own terms, with no emergency clock ticking down, lulled me into this weird sense of control. Like I had a grip on it all. Like I was choosing the dark, rather than being swallowed by it. But when I turned to head back, trying to beat the end of my shift, I quickly realized that confidence doesn‚Äôt count for much when reality refuses to play along. I‚Äôd stuck to my plan: always take right turns. No distractions, no shortcuts. I had no reason to be disoriented, no locked doors, no closed-off exits, just empty corridors and decaying walls. Then I reached one particularly memorable crossing, one I‚Äôd come through earlier. 
    
    Only‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt a door anymore. It was a solid wall of ancient bricks. Weathered. Cracked. As if they'd been there for centuries. That‚Äôs when the edge of panic crept in. Nothing major yet, just that low, leaden weight in the chest, the chill that starts where your hands meet metal. And then,  The knocking. Familiar now. Rhythmic. Almost welcoming, in the worst way. I didn‚Äôt have a better plan, so I followed it. Threading through cramped corridors, ducking under low-hanging copper tubing, stepping gingerly around exposed wires and half-torn insulation. Someone had dumped an old wardrobe across a doorway, took me ten minutes to climb over. I marked everything as best I could. Wiring clusters. Pipe junctions. Water-stained ceiling tiles. 
    
    Eventually, I found the room. And just like every other time, the knocking stopped the moment I arrived. But this time‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt silent. There were voices. Two of them. One, dry and failing, rasping like old lungs under wet cloth. The other‚Ä¶ not human. Scratchy and rusted, like iron scraping against iron. A sound you feel more in your teeth than your ears. They were arguing. I couldn‚Äôt make out the words, but somehow, I knew neither of them knew I was there. Yet. 
    
    I tightened my grip on the heavy flathead screwdriver in my pocket, not to play hero, just to feel like I had something if things went south. From the hallway, I could see into the room. Dim light flickered overhead, barely enough to catch the shapes of two figures locked in a heated argument. One taller, the other stockier, more animated. I couldn‚Äôt make out their words, just the brittle energy in the air, the way one jabbed a finger at the other like punctuation. 
    
    Then, without warning, it turned violent. The smaller one lunged. No weapon, no dramatic windup, just sudden, brute force. A sickening thud echoed off the concrete as the taller man hit the ground. I stood frozen for a second too long. The stocky one grabbed the other by the ankles and started dragging him away, deeper into the tunnels. The man groaned, then shouted, raw, panicked, desperate. ‚ÄúHelp!‚Äù I ran. Sprinting over cables, slipping a little on the damp concrete. They were just ahead of me, still in sight as they passed through the doorway. But when I reached it‚Ä¶ there was no one. Nothing. 
    
    Just a blank corridor. No footsteps. No voices. No dragging marks continuing past the threshold. Only the floor behind me told the truth, thick, bloody smears where the man had tried to fight back. Deep scratch marks in the dust, as if he'd clawed the ground in a last attempt to escape. But beyond the door... nothing. It all just ended. His voice didn‚Äôt echo down the tunnels. Only in my head. Where it still hasn‚Äôt stopped.
    
    I was lost again. But before I doubled back or started testing new exits, I figured I might as well investigate the room. Maybe it was a distraction. Maybe I was trying to convince myself I was still in control. There was a camp tucked into the shadows, someone had laid out a bed of soaked, flattened cardboard, half-rotted. A shopping cart frame had been gutted and turned into a makeshift grill. And scattered across the floor, like a miser‚Äôs broken offering, were coins. All kinds. Some looked ancient, coppery, silver, even the glint of something gold. Mixed in with them were a few euro cents, but only the smallest denominations. The kind no one ever picks up. A few meters away, against the wall, was‚Ä¶ a shrine. That‚Äôs the only word I have for it. It was cobbled together from scrap metal, splintered wood, a few bent rebars like spines poking out of the top. Around it were bottles of schnapps, unopened, along with packets of tobacco, some still sealed. Etched into the damp wood were symbols. Jagged. Repetitive. I couldn‚Äôt make sense of them, but they made my skin itch just looking. Then I heard the knocking again. And whatever was, or wasn‚Äôt, behind the door I came through, that knock was my best bet at getting out. 
    
    So I followed. I passed through hallways scarred with scratches. Some on the walls. Some on the floor. One of the breaker boxes I passed looked like it had shorted out decades ago, wires burnt black and fused to the metal casing. But the one thing I haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about? A steel beam, T-profile, half blocking the corridor. At first I didn‚Äôt give it a second glance. Scrap metal is everywhere down there. But something bugged me. It wasn‚Äôt bent from weight or pressure. It was twisted sideways. Like it had been wrenched out of line by something that didn‚Äôt understand how metal is supposed to resist. Just as I passed it, a gust of hot air slammed into my back. I turned on instinct, nothing there. No vent. No door. No sound. But the knocking continued. So I kept going. And eventually, it led me to an exit. 
    
    A rusted metal hatch that opened right onto the edge of an active subway platform. Probably twenty meters from the nearest passengers. I walked out like I belonged, tools in hand, nodding like I‚Äôd just finished routine maintenance. No one questioned me. When I went back the next day, stupidly, stubbornly, the brick wall had become a doorway again. But I didn‚Äôt go in. Not that day. I‚Äôd had enough for one week. 
    
    I‚Äôve always liked energy drinks. They're sweet and sour, sharp enough to make your teeth ache, like drinking straight from a battery. There‚Äôs something about that artificial bite that wakes me up in a way nothing else does. Coffee, though? Bitter. Only palatable with enough milk and sugar to make it resemble cheap cocoa. Still, I drink it. All the time. It‚Äôs not even about the taste anymore. It‚Äôs part of the job, like carrying screwdrivers in your pockets or constantly checking your flashlight batteries. Everyone offers you coffee. You stop turning it down. After a while, you can‚Äôt work without it. Same goes for smoking. I know, I know, ‚ÄúJust take a five-minute breather instead.‚Äù That‚Äôs what people say. But then they give you that look the moment you actually do. Like rest is a privilege you haven‚Äôt earned. But a smoke? That‚Äôs a sanctioned excuse. No one questions it. If the job‚Äôs kicking your ass, it buys you a break. If you‚Äôre stuck waiting around for a boiler to cool down or a key you don‚Äôt have, it gives your hands something to do. I tell myself it‚Äôs just practical, but truth is, I‚Äôm hooked. And I‚Äôve smoked in places that should absolutely forbid it. Including the labyrinth as I have come to call it. Down there, as long as there‚Äôs no smoke detector and I‚Äôm alone, I‚Äôll light one. The glow of the cherry, the first burn of the inhale, it calms the noise in my head. For a moment, the maze doesn‚Äôt feel so close. The dark doesn‚Äôt feel so thick. Just me, the silence, and a curl of smoke that always seems to drift in the wrong direction. 
    
    I haven‚Äôt told anyone this part, not Gregor, not Thomas, not even my best friend Jim. But I encountered him again. The dwarf. That short, broad figure, the one who dragged a man into nothingness while I stood helplessly rooted to the floor. Just remembering it now leaves my hands cold. 
    
    It had been a long day. I was elbow-deep in a heat pump that had practically written its own HVAC horror story, refrigerant leak into the cooling loop, unit running in a vacuum, a gulp of water freezing inside the expansion nozzle, tripping a high-pressure alarm. Textbook catastrophe. Somewhere out there, this story is already being told over beers at a technician‚Äôs convention, everyone laughing until they remember they‚Äôve seen similar. But down there in the guts of the building, three floors underground, in a service room no guest or receptionist knows exists, I was focused. Just me, the machinery, and a cigarette quietly burning while I tried to work out what went wrong. No smoke detector. No noise. Just silence and compressor rattle and the sound of my lighter flicking to life. 
    
    And that‚Äôs when I felt him. Not heard, felt. Like a pressure shift in the air, like heat bending around the edges of my awareness. I didn‚Äôt turn immediately. My head was still in the machine. But something in the back of my brain, deep and survival-colored, whispered: He‚Äôs behind you.
    
    It smelled like copper, oil, antifreeze, and tobacco smoke. I couldn‚Äôt tell if that was just my own hands or if some of it clung to him. The cigarette was burning low in my fingers, the ember crawling faster than it should, like it wanted out of that room more than I did. Then his voice came, from just behind me. It didn‚Äôt belong in any place built by human hands. Like rust scraping on rust, like an old clock stuttering against itself, he spoke: 
    ‚ÄúYou look like a craftsman. Do you need a helping hand?‚Äù 
    My grip tightened on the tool I‚Äôd been using. It was the kind of offer that sounded perfect, if it hadn‚Äôt come from whatever dragged itself up through the cracks between concrete and dream. Sweat traced a slow line down my forehead, dripping onto the metal guts of the machine in front of me.
    
    ‚ÄúMaybe you need a pickaxe? No... you don‚Äôt dig. You‚Äôre like a smith‚Ä¶‚Äù
    There was a pause, and then the voice grew more eager, almost gleeful. 
    ‚ÄúA powerful hammer? Or more of a lucky charm?‚Äù 
    He was cycling through suggestions, each one tossed out like bait. 
    ‚ÄúOr like those other poor souls, a treasure? You only have to pay‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a bargain.‚Äù 
    
    Then, silence. Too long. Too still. I took a drag from the cigarette out of habit more than anything else, felt it singe my fingers, and dropped it with a hiss. ‚ÄúN-no, thank you. I‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said, trying to stitch some confidence into my voice. Behind me, bare feet padded softly across concrete. Toward the door. I turned just in time to see him, just for a heartbeat. Small. Stocky. Beard and hair like metal shavings, eyes gleaming copper-bright. That grin, sharp and hungry. And then the door slammed shut behind him. When I pulled it open, the corridor was empty. No sound. No footprints. No trace. Only the slow, smoky curl from my dropped cigarette, and the terrible certainty that whatever bargain he was offering‚Ä¶ he hadn't made it for the first time.

By the look of things on my phone, i'd be waiting much longer.  
I looked down the street from the hospital I was at. I remembered an old friend, Johnny Irons.  
Happy go lucky chap.¬†  
""wanna ride?"" Taxi cab cruising slowly window cracked open.  
""No I think i'm going to visit a friend.""

""Johnny are you home?"" Noone was there, I let myself in. A one story wooden house spacey and simple.  
Made a coffee and the sound of a v8 motor came bursting aggressively through the walls and windows.  
""What the fuck are you doing here?"" He gave me a confused hug not quite knowing the amount of affection to put into it.  
""I was up at the hospital"" I answered.  
""Oh I know how that goes, my Dad is there in the next room, his healths not great.""  
""Is he okay, I let myself in, you wanna check on him?""  
""No he will be up soon, last night he went on a bender.""  
""Can't be good for the old fella""  
""Lost his job and mum left him the same week.""

We looked down at our coffee.  
""Wanna help me paint?""  
""Yeah why not?"" I volunteered.  
His sister Mary walked in from the street ""Is Dad up yet?""  
""No he'll be sleeping in, Bender.""  
""We've got to find him a job or he's going to go mad.""

The deck in his back yard was well built.  
""Perfect for summer evenings"" I remarked.  
""Yep"" Johnny responded.  
""So how's work?""  
""Bro I need to come clean, I also lost my job. And I¬¥m totally hung over.""  
""Terrible news, do you want to come work at my farm?""  
He just looked at me as if offended.

""I just came back this morning from getting a new tattoo.""  
""what it is it?""¬†  
Johnny lifted his shirt from the waist to reveal a set of skulls hovering below his belly button.  
""Oh wow"" I pretended.  
""scored some primo hash, wanna smoke?""  
""Nah man left that stuff, it brings me down.""

Our paintbrushes slowly made their way through the entire coat.  
""what makes you make such shit decisions every single day of your God given life, man? You speak like your homeless your close to forty five, you still do drugs and get tattoos.""  
""Oh harsh bro, do you talk to all your friends like that?""  
""Only when I'm being real with them. You are getting old and it seems you just don't care. All your problems seem to stem from the fact that you just don't give a fuck about anything, you didn't even ask me why I was at the hospital."" I added.  
His father walked out onto the patio. ""What the fuck are you talking to my son like that for?""  
""Oh you must be the shitkicker father, did you not teach your son to be a man?""  
""Fuck you arsehole ""He picked up the whole can of paint and threw it at my face.  
""Ah, get your Dad under control."" I shouted.  
Johnny took a swing at me but missed.  
His father exchanged blows with me until we were both exhausted, he fell down on the dusty ground and opened his cigarette pack. I positioned myself to kick him in the head as hard as I could, but I stopped seeing just how sick he was. Instead I said.  
""You even gave up the fight so you could feed your smoking habit. And your dying!""¬†  
""Ill get my shotgun"" Johnny ran into the house¬†

I ran toward the back gate that connected onto another adjoining to the hospital. Tripped on the last step and hurt my shoulder.  
""Go get fucked losers, where do you think you are, this is not some fucking slum. you are not gangsters or clever hustlers, you are Shit kickers."" I screamed this until every internal organ stung.

As I walked into the street, my head bleeding. I looked right to where the road would take me home, and looked back up toward the hospital, maybe it was the paint fumes, but it seemed that the six story building(hospital) was grinning down at me.

On my way back to the hospital, the taxicab man passed by me.

We've been chatting somewhat playfully for 3-4 months now as I go to the coffee shop almost every day to order coffee and once or twice a week I'll have a brownie. I'll sometimes even say hi or goodbye to him in a flirty manner, to which he reacts enthusiastically albeit shy.

However, yesterday I noticed he was quite cold and distant. I sent him a follow request on Instagram last night. This morning, when I logged in to see if he'd accepted it my request was left pending and he updated his bio to ""JESUS IS KING"". Like that, in all caps locks.

Due to religious trauma from the whole ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" stuff I've heard throughout my life, I immediately cancelled the request and went on about my day kind of pissed. I mean, it's obviously okay if you don't want to befriend someone on social media but I can't help but feel like he updated the bio as a means to repel me.

What do you guys think? I'm potentially neurodivergent as well, so I don't know how to sometimes pick up on social cues.

Abridged essay.*

>‚ÄúWhat suburbia cries for are the means for people to gather easily, inexpensively, regularly, and pleasurably.‚Äù -**Ray Oldenburg**

My local caf√© used to be within walking distance. The couch sank too deep, the tables were messy, the chessboards missing pieces. But it felt like home.

When it closed, I didn‚Äôt expect it to hurt. Starbucks became my fallback. I don‚Äôt love their coffee, but the space worked for focus and deep work. Still, both places lacked something essential.

Then, a new caf√© opened right next to my home. It‚Äôs part of a regional chain, but it has what Ray Oldenburg called a third place: a space outside home or work where you can relax, belong, and connect.

Thanks for reading Curious Sardine! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.

Oldenburg put it best in¬†*The Great Good Place*:

‚Äú‚Ä¶when the good citizens of a community find places to spend pleasurable hours with one another for no specific or obvious purpose, there is purpose to such association.‚Äù

I‚Äôd always known about the third place, but it wasn‚Äôt until a few visits that I realized why this caf√© resonated more than my past experiences. Then the pieces clicked.

On my first visit, I met one of the owners, or maybe the operational lead, who was helping open the caf√©. We exchanged names and greeted each other every time I came back. Before long, I started running into neighbors and friends I hadn‚Äôt seen in months. On my last visit, a neighbor I didn‚Äôt recognize (though she probably knew me from the local Facebook group) walked right up and greeted me confidently. My wife, kids, and I sat with her, and a quick hello turned into a long, warm conversation.

**One common thread ran through these moments: community.**

This reminded me of a friend who owns several coffee shops in South Florida. Community has always been his focus. He hosts poetry nights, music sessions, and art showcases. He‚Äôs deeply embedded in each city he operates in. Everyone knows him, and he knows them. His shops succeed because they‚Äôre more than businesses. They‚Äôre community hubs.

Contrast that with Starbucks.

Recently,¬†[they announced closures of some stores](https://www.businessinsider.com/list-of-closing-starbucks-locations-2025-9). Perhaps that‚Äôs because they‚Äôve lost sight of community.

Even before those closures, its new CEO admitted¬†[it wanted to return to that neighborly caf√© experience](https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/starbucks-wants-to-be-your-neighborhood-coffee-shop-again/731699/).¬†**Because that‚Äôs what people want: another place to call home.**¬†A place where you aren‚Äôt alone but surrounded by familiar faces, and where every visit brings the chance to meet someone new.

True community spaces also become second nature, like an involuntary heartbeat. When there‚Äôs news or something worth talking about, everyone knows where to go. In Albert Camus‚Äô¬†*The Plague*, for example, it‚Äôs no surprise that when he wants to depict a sense of normalcy after a disease ravages a town, he writes how residents return to the caf√©:

‚ÄúCafes and picture-houses did as much business as before. But on a closer view you might notice that people looked less strained, and they occasionally smiled. And this brought home the fact that since the outbreak of plague no one had hitherto been seen to smile in public.‚Äù

These communities and spaces may grow organically over time, but they don‚Äôt happen by accident. Community spaces require intentionality.

My old caf√© proved that. People knew each other, but few went out of their way to connect. If I broke the silence and tried to start a conversation, the most I usually got was an AirPod removed, a request to repeat myself, and a half-sincere nod.

**Community has to be designed through the layout, the culture, and the location.**¬†Let‚Äôs explore these elements, because they don‚Äôt just apply to caf√©s. They apply to workplaces, neighborhoods, and even our daily lives.

# II. The anatomy of a community space

A community space is both physical and abstract. You can design for it, but you can‚Äôt force it. Communities grow organically, like seeds planted in the right soil. And with the right foundation, they can flourish.

# The layout

A welcoming space balances openness with intimacy. My neighborhood caf√© does this well. Two lounge areas with leather seats and low tables invite close conversations. A wide lobby gives space to linger and bump into new people. A row of tables lets solo workers focus. And long community tables encourage strangers to sit side by side, sparking introductions.

That mix of environments (quiet, social, and communal) makes it easy for different kinds of connections to form.

# The team culture

Community doesn‚Äôt take root without people modeling it. Staff (or leaders in any group) set the tone. If they‚Äôre closed off or dismissive, the atmosphere dies. But if they‚Äôre welcoming, forward, and genuinely interested, it signals to others that connection is safe.

This culture of hospitality is key to a community space. Community cannot grow without it, particularly the welcome of a guest. Homer describes this well in¬†*The Odyssey*:

‚ÄúHere in our house you‚Äôll find a royal welcome. Have supper first, then tell us what you need.‚Äù

The guest is greeted (Athena in disguise) by Odysseus‚Äôs son, Telemachus. Athena is welcomed, fed, and supported. These are the ingredients to a fruitful community culture.

What‚Äôs interesting is how passionate Telemachus was to make the guest feel welcome. This was not a passive approach but an active one with energy and purpose. Homer describes the scene when the prince sees the guest:

‚Äú‚Ä¶straight to the porch he went, mortified that a guest might still be standing at the doors‚Ä¶he clasped her right hand and relieving her at once of her long bronze spear, met her with winged words.‚Äù

Notice, the host disarmed the guest. This is critical because it demonstrates that the guest can feel safe and comfortable in Telemachus‚Äôs home and under his protection.¬†**This is called**¬†***xenia***, the ancient Greek practice of guest-friendship and a duty to hospitality, all tied to a sacred set of rules for hosts and guests.

When my new caf√© first opened, the staff‚Äôs warmth seemed to spread. People struck up conversations in line. They lingered next to each other instead of retreating into their own worlds. That culture made all the difference.

# The location

Where a space is built shapes who shows up and what kind of community forms. A caf√© in the heart of a city will attract entrepreneurs, software engineers, and freelancers. Try to replicate that in a suburb, and the vibe changes completely. Location filters the community.

In Atlanta, Paschal Brothers served as a meeting place during the Civil Rights Movement. Martin Luther King Jr. and his allies often gathered there. In 1966,¬†*Ebony*¬†magazine described the diner as ‚Äú[a large attractive building](https://books.google.com/books?id=71nrBoK-ilEC&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false)¬†with a soda fountain and booth in front and a large dining room in the rear.‚Äù Across the street stood La Carousel, also owned by the Paschals, which ‚Äúfeatures the finest jazz singers and musicians in the country.‚Äù These community spaces provided layered environments for many interests and arts, nurturing the African American community and empowering them to overcome adversity‚Äîall in a city already fostering this growing group.

# III. The importance of shared values

A community space is only possible if people are united in purpose. In¬†*The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock*, T.S. Eliot wrote:

‚ÄúIn the room the women come and go / Talking of Michelangelo.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a reminder that shared spaces are only meaningful when paired with shared ideas. People must agree to connect, whether around art, work, or simply local life.

In caf√©s, that agreement is often unspoken. People work quietly side by side, trade hellos, and chat about the neighborhood or industry. The shared value is simple: a desire for community in everyday life.

Without shared values, the space is just furniture. With values, it becomes alive.

# Types of community spaces

Caf√©s are just one model. Other spaces can play the same role:

* Libraries
* Colleges and student centers
* Hotel or office lobbies
* Bookstores
* Parks, plazas, and public squares
* Saunas and pools at gyms and wellness centers
* Churches
* Breweries

Each of these spaces invites people in, usually based on common values and purposes, and holds the potential to spark new relationships.

When a team or leader designs these spaces specifically for community-building, everything falls into place.

Whether you find a community space or create one, look for ways to cultivate engagement, authentic connections, and shared purpose. Third places give us more than a seat and a cup of coffee. They give us belonging. They become sources of new friendships, renewed inspiration, deeper productivity, and a stronger sense of community. And we need more of them.

Then I realized it‚Äôs actually built in the tiniest choices you make when no one is watching. Like walking into a coffee shop alone and ordering the weirdest drink on the menu without flinching, or sitting at a bar and actually talking to the bartender like you belong there. I started making eye contact with strangers on the street, laughing at my own jokes even if no one else did, and standing a little taller even when I felt like shrinking.

It‚Äôs insane how quickly people respond to tiny doses of self ownership. Suddenly coworkers started listening when I spoke, random people smiled back, and my friends started asking for advice. None of it was a big performance, none of it was pretending to be someone else, it was just me taking up space unapologetically.

The magnetic part? I didn‚Äôt plan it. I just stopped hiding. And that‚Äôs the thing: confidence isn‚Äôt loud or flashy. It‚Äôs the subtle decisions you make over and over again that quietly tell the world you matter. The best part is you can start today, alone, with the smallest step that feels stupid or awkward, and watch how people can‚Äôt help but notice.",5,1759498918.0,confidence,3,0.86,False

Whether I was chasing the latest US drama, a UK football match, Canadian news, or a late-night French documentary, I wanted something that could keep up with my unpredictable tastes. Here‚Äôs how my top five landed for 2025‚Äîa mix of old favorites and surprising newcomers.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (even less if you go for a longer [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/))
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (all the US/UK/CA/FR you could want, and then some)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (99% smooth, but the odd hiccup when everyone‚Äôs watching the same UK match)
    
*   **My experience:** I stumbled on IPTVMEZZY after seeing it mentioned by a French **iptv reseller** in a tech group. The range is wild‚Äîone minute I‚Äôm watching Canadian news, the next it‚Äôs French crime series, then a US basketball game. Their **best iptv trial** let me poke around before paying, and it played nicely with all my screens. It‚Äôs rare that I need to refresh a stream, even during big events.
    

* * *

### 2\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (discounted for longer subscriptions)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (excellent US, UK, CA, FR options)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (super steady, even when my whole house is streaming)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV came recommended by a UK friend who‚Äôs an [**iptv reseller**](https://xxiptv.top/). It‚Äôs become my go-to when I want to flip between Canadian hockey, US news, and the occasional French film. The interface is clean, and I like that I can set favorites. I barely ever see buffering, even during live US sports.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (especially strong for UK/FR, but US/CA are well covered)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (excellent for movies and series, minor lag during UK football finals)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming ended up as my ‚Äúunexpected winner‚Äù for British and French VOD. I lost a whole weekend to old French thrillers and British quiz shows. Most streams were smooth, but there was a bit of lag during live UK games when everyone jumped online.
    

* * *

### 4\. [MetroCast IPTV](https://aurorastreaming.online/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 22,000+ live, 62,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, a handful of FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for day-to-day, can slow down during big sports nights)
    
*   **My experience:** MetroCast IPTV is my ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù pick. It‚Äôs ideal for US talk shows, UK documentaries, and Canadian weather. French content is lighter, but the core stuff is there. Their signup for [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://aurorastreaming.online/) was quick, and the EPG is refreshingly simple.
    

* * *

### 5\. ZenithPlay TV

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 15,500+ live, 45,000+ VOD (mainly US/UK, some CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evenings get a little laggy, especially with live US or UK sports)
    
*   **My experience:** ZenithPlay TV is my fallback‚Äîgood for US sitcoms or UK news while making dinner. Don‚Äôt expect magic with live events, but it‚Äôs fine for casual watching. I peeked at their **iptv reseller** tools and it looked newbie-friendly, but I‚Äôm not ready for that adventure yet.

IPTV Life Lessons After a Year of Streaming
-------------------------------------------

*   **Always try the best iptv trial**‚Äîwhat works for one person might not work on your devices or in your region.
    
*   A huge channel count is cool, but I always drift back to my handful of favorites.
    
*   Even the [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) providers have the odd hiccup during major live events (especially US or UK sports nights).

1nwzbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayAppliance/comments/1nwzbpc/explore_the_best_singleserve_coffee_maker/,Explore the Best Single-Serve Coffee Maker Nespresso Vertuo,"**Compact Design Meets Functionality**  
Using the Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 for the past few weeks has genuinely elevated my coffee game. The sleek chrome finish fits perfectly in my minimalistic kitchen setup. Measuring 8 inches deep, 12 inches wide, and 12 inches tall, it doesn‚Äôt overwhelm the counter space. Its design feels like it‚Äôs been borrowed from a futuristic barista‚Äôs toolkit, and honestly, I‚Äôve caught myself admiring it while waiting for my coffee to brew. The removable 40-ounce water reservoir is as practical as it gets and surprisingly easy to snap in and out for refills. Those early mornings of fumbling with a machine are now behind me. If aesthetics matter to you, this product delivers not only functionality but also compliments to your kitchen‚Äôs decor.

**Versatility That Stands Out**  
This coffee maker‚Äôs versatility left me impressed. It brews five different cup sizes ‚Äì from a petite 1.35-ounce espresso shot to a satisfying 14-ounce cup of coffee. Whether I‚Äôm craving a bold espresso or a mellow iced coffee, this machine has me covered. The instructions, though detailed, were easy to follow. I also experimented with using it for iced lattes, and the results were nothing short of caf√©-worthy. With its one-button operation, it delivers consistent results that haven‚Äôt let me down.

[Check Nespresso BNV220CRO1BUC1 price on Amazon.](https://ikerz.com/p/b01n6tvx8h/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Quick 25-second heat-up time ensures your coffee routine is never delayed.  
- Fully automatic operation simplifies the brewing process.  
- Compact design suits small kitchens or limited counter space.  
- Versatile brewing options satisfy multiple tastes and coffee styles.

**Pitfalls**  
- Only compatible with Nespresso Vertuo capsules, limiting options for third-party pods.  
- Replacement pods can be expensive over time, especially for frequent users.  
- Capsule-specific brewing locks you into the Nespresso ecosystem.  

**Exceptional Brewing Technology**  
Centrifusion technology, a hallmark of this product, deserves applause. As skeptical as I was about a system that spins capsules at 7,000 rotations per minute, the crema it produces on coffee is genuinely rich and luxurious. The barcode reading system adjusts settings automatically, so every cup fits its intended profile. Whether you‚Äôre drinking an espresso or a gran lungo, the extraction is flawless. This is far beyond what my older coffee machine used to achieve.  

**Complimentary Capsule Range: A Nice Gesture**  
Getting this coffee maker felt slightly indulgent, but the complimentary capsule starter set sealed the deal for me. Each capsule brings distinct flavors, and the variety reminded me why I love experimenting with coffee so much. My sister, who visited for a week, eagerly sampled them all and even ordered her machine after being blown away by the taste diversity. It‚Äôs worth noting that capsule assortment may vary, but that element of surprise adds to the fun.

**Alternative Offerings**  
When compared to similar products such as Keurig K-Elite or De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica, the Nespresso Vertuo surpasses in terms of crema quality and overall user experience. While Keurig lovers appreciate their machine‚Äôs compatibility with generic pods, they often miss out on the richness that this coffee maker provides. De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica brings a traditional espresso-making charm, but the process is manual and less convenient for busy mornings. If you prioritize convenience and taste above all, this product edges out competitors by a fair margin.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For its features and cutting-edge technology, this machine feels well-priced. The initial investment might seem hefty at first glance, but its performance justifies the cost over time. Other coffee makers might have a lower upfront price, but they compromise on quality or convenience. Regular users might find themselves spending more on capsules, but considering the indulgence of caf√©-quality coffee at home, the expense starts to make sense.

So when my brother came out as trans, my parents instantly started on a lot of bull that is not my story to tell. But long story short I went to live with my brother and sister-in-law.

I also feel like I'm not allowed to be attracted to men. She herself is mostly into women, and I've sat through many rants about how evil men are. Yesterday I got asked out for coffee by a man, (it's not even a date yet). But she flew off the handle. Asking me if ""I didn't remember my boundaries"".

With its brushed stainless steel finish, it has this clean, polished look that fits beautifully in my kitchen without taking over the counter. As someone who relies on a good coffee machine to kickstart their mornings and, admittedly, to survive the occasional all-nighter, I was more than intrigued.

The dual boiler setup promised to brew espresso and steam milk simultaneously. This feature immediately caught my attention because the previous machines I‚Äôve used made me wait awkwardly between pulling shots and frothing milk. With this, I could actually make a latte without losing heat or ruining the texture by the time the milk was ready. It‚Äôs programmable too, so I customized the shot temperature to my liking. Honestly, who doesn‚Äôt want to feel like a scientist calibrating their coffee?

**Benefits**

Brewing my first few espressos with the machine showed me why it truly stands out. Here are some standout aspects I noticed:  

- The dual boiler function is a game-changer. Being able to pull espresso and steam milk at the same time genuinely felt like luxury in a home machine.  
- Customizable settings let me tweak everything, from shot temperature to pre-infusion timing. This level of control isn‚Äôt always offered in similar machines.  
- Included tools like the 58mm stainless steel tamper and Razor Dosing Tool made the process fuss-free, providing precision in every step. These little extras really made a big difference to the experience.

**Considerations for Daily Use**

Not everything is perfect with this fully automatic espresso machine, though it doesn't fall short by much. One aspect I struggled with is the weight. At nearly 28.4 pounds, moving it around the counter isn‚Äôt exactly a one-handed job. It's not something you‚Äôll want to tuck away in a cabinet after every use. Another point worth mentioning is that the learning curve was steeper than I‚Äôd expected. Yes, it‚Äôs programmable, but for a non-techie coffee enthusiast, diving into the manual was a necessity. Even after reading the instructions, the wide array of settings took a bit of trial and error to master.  

**Areas for Improvement**

Through my experience, here are a few aspects that could use some refining:  

- The water tank design could be more accessible. Refilling it, especially when the machine is under a cabinet, is slightly cumbersome.  
- The drip tray tends to fill up faster than expected, and emptying it can feel like a chore if you're making drinks back to back.  
- On occasion, I noticed the stand-by button being overly sensitive, which caused minor interruptions mid-prep.  

**Other Options**

Speaking of similar appliances, I‚Äôve also tried the Gaggia Classic Pro and the De'Longhi La Specialista. While the Gaggia offers a more straightforward interface, it lacks the programmable features this machine has. The De'Longhi, on the other hand, scores points for its auto-tamping feature, but it doesn‚Äôt have the dual boiler, which makes a night-and-day difference in speed. Compared to both, the Breville BES920XL feels like a step above in terms of professional-level features for at-home usage. However, if you‚Äôre someone who prefers simplicity, these alternatives might still have an edge for you.

**Price Performance**

While the asking price might feel a bit intimidating for casual coffee drinkers, I found its features and performance completely justifiable for aficionados who value precision and customization. Factor in the included tools and accessories, and it starts to sound more reasonable. The reusable filter and cleaning kit were thoughtful touches that ensured I wouldn't need to purchase extras right away. Anecdotally, my co-worker swapped out her daily $6 coffee house run with this machine, and to her, it‚Äôs paid for itself in just a few months.

My last relationship of 3 years ended last March, we lived together but we never dated in the traditional sense, we just hooked up one day and started spending time together until we were officially together.

Now I realise I have no idea how to actually date, I have had a few first dates in the past (not sure they even count as dates, I just asked girls out for a coffee) and they all ended up in getting friendzoned, which is not that bad I actually enjoy making friends.

Last week I matched with a girl on tinder who seemed like a good match for me, she said she is looking for a long term relationship and I said the same.

We chatted for a bit and then I asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee to which she said yes.

We met for coffee and talked for around 3 hours, during which I didn't make any attempt to be more touchy with her, except for the hug I gave her when I first saw her.

I'm starting to think maybe I should have initiated more physical touch actions ? Maybe hold her hand ?

All in all I would say it was a good interaction and we even made plans for a second date this weekend but when I talked about it with friends they asked if I kissed her ? Do people do that on first dates ?

Should I try to be more physical the next time I see her ? She seems interested at least, she initiates conversations over text and replies to my stories and overall seems invested in conversations.

I'm just scared I set the wrong tone by not being more touchy with her and maybe she will see me more as a friend ?

Well... no. Light wrote it into the Death Note. It was within the realm of possibility, why **it HAD to happen!**

The moment he wrote the events down, Light himself, as well as everyone else necessary, was under the influence of the Death Note. (kinda like the 'Final Destination' movies, were fate steers events...)

The book will change the world (subtly) so things happen the way as described, if possible!

If I write ""Bob the Builder is run over at 12PM by his own goggle-eyed steamroller"" - Bob will step in front of it at this time, sure, but the self-aware steamroller will also set himself in motion at THIS time!""

  
People seem to forget the guy didn't simply die.

\- the bus driver stopped at the right time, in the right place, after driving for a while around.

\- the guy got out and fell down

\- and A SPEEDING CAR (the only one nearby!!) ran the guy over! 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n\_aYCUa0D4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7n_aYCUa0D4)

What are the odds?

The car that came right behind the bus didn't slow down, and apparently drove in the middle of the road, didn't try to dodge, but only applied the brakes (too slow). The car didn't even have ABS Anti-lock braking system (its tyres screeched).

**If the car had come 3 seconds earlier or later, it wouldn't have worked.**

The car would have either moved past the bus or had time to see the guy and stop. = he survived.

**The Death Note, not Light's foresight, timed it.**

  
So yeah, I think its not fair to give Light credit for the timing, AT ALL.

The thing with the way he tricked the cop to expose himself, sure, that's on him. The rest, not.

\-------  
btw, something similar happens in 'Overlord' the Anime, Ainz the protagonist, seems to have absurd charisma and luck. It's an Iseka,i and the guy now lives as his video game character. His magician's charisma and luck stats were high, why he can now talk people easily into everything, and the world seems to work 'just right in his favour'. Charisma effect is somewhat highlighted, but the LUCK, is more of a 'big picture thing' that works in the background, changing the world in his favor without anyone aware of it (not even himself)...

The same thing is going on in Death Note.

If you write about ""a plane falling down"" some worker will forget to put in the right screw because - a cat knocked over his coffee or whatever... - details impossible to trace back.

**It's fair to say the Death Note robs you (and the world at large) to some degree of your own free will!**

If it is determined XY will happen and YOU are part of XY - you had no choice in the matter.

  
The robber had no chance in hell NOT to die at this point and in this manner. The only 'freedom' he had, once it was written, was everything THAT WASN'T written.

With this strategy, businesses are able to reach potential customers that are most likely to be interested in their products or services. And what better way to reach customers than by targeting those who are in close proximity to your business? In this article, we will discuss how you can target ads to people near your business and why it is important for the success of your marketing efforts.

To begin with, targeting ads to people near your business allows you to reach a highly relevant and engaged audience. By focusing on those who live or work near your business, you are more likely to attract potential customers who may be looking for a quick and convenient solution to their needs. For example, if you own a coffee shop, targeting ads to people who work nearby can help you increase foot traffic and ultimately sales.

Furthermore, targeting ads to people near your business can also save you money. With traditional forms of advertising such as television or print, businesses would have to spend a significant amount of money to reach a wide audience. However, with targeted advertising, you are able to focus your budget on a specific group of people who are more likely to convert into customers. This not only makes your advertising more effective but also more cost-efficient.

In addition, targeting ads to people near your business can help you improve your overall customer experience. By reaching out to those in close proximity, you can provide them with relevant and timely information about your business, such as promotions or new products. This not only helps increase customer loyalty but also builds a strong relationship with your community.

Seriously! Who needs a treadmill when you have an engine to rebuild? ü§£ Let‚Äôs break down why jumping into the world of classic car restoration might be the most fulfilling way to spend your golden years (and get fit while doing it!).

**1. Hands-on Exercise**
   - **Forget the weights:** Lifting those heavy tools or pushing that stubborn car door can give those biceps a real workout. 
   - **Cardio: It's a pit stop!** Ever have to sprint for that tool you just realized you left‚Ä¶ somewhere? Instant heart rate booster!

**2. Mental Gymnastics**
   - **Sharpen those problem-solving skills:** Every car has its quirks. Figuring out what‚Äôs wrong is like solving a fun puzzle! 
   - **Focus and flow:** Getting absorbed in the details of restoration can put you into a state of 'flow'‚Äîand let‚Äôs face it, that‚Äôs way better than counting reps. 

**3. Social Connections** 
   - **Meet like-minded folks:** Car clubs aren‚Äôt just for show-offs. They‚Äôre communities! You‚Äôll bond over rusty fenders and engine rebuilds. 
   - **Swap stories and tips:** Sharing your triumphs (and hiccups) over a cup of coffee can feel just as good as a solid gym session. 

**4. Creativity Unleashed**
   - **Design your dream ride:** Personalizing a project car is a creative outlet that keeps the mind sharp (and skips boring gym routines). 
   - **Art meets mechanics:** Each touch on that vehicle is like a brush on a canvas; who wouldn‚Äôt want to paint their masterpiece? 

So, the gym might sell you on treadmills, but the garage will offer you grit and rewarding satisfaction. Plus, there's something about working on a classic car that just feels... timeless, doesn‚Äôt it? 

And who knows, after a few months, you might realize you‚Äôve not only restored a car but also brought back a bit of that youthful spirit and strength!

1nwyt7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1nwyt7n/6_years_sober_from_alcohol_on_a_path_i_walked/,6 years sober from alcohol on a path I walked myself. Sharing what worked for this outsider.,"Hey everyone. I‚Äôve been lurking here a long time, and this community helped me more than I can say when I was in the thick of it. I hit six years sober from alcohol recently, and I feel like I should finally share my story. Especially for those of you who feel like you don‚Äôt fit the mold, or for whom the mainstream paths don‚Äôt seem to click. I also want to preface this with I don‚Äôt mean to disparage anybody else‚Äôs successful path. I just want to highlight alternative paths that result in the same goals.

I‚Äôm not here to tell you what to do. I‚Äôm just a guy with a high school diploma, a 9 ACE score, and a brain that doesn‚Äôt seem to work like everyone else‚Äôs. I couldn‚Äôt do things the way I was supposed to. AA felt like another box I was failing to fit into. I felt broken.

So, I had to find solutions to my own recovery. I stopped thinking about willpower and started thinking about my own internal mechanics. What was the function of the alcohol? For me, it was the only thing that could shut off a screaming alarm of anxiety in my nervous system.

My path wasn't pretty or linear. Here‚Äôs the honest sequence of how it worked for me:

I started with harm reduction, not perfection. The physical anxiety without alcohol was brutal. So, I immediately replaced booze with non-alcoholic beers and used cannabis. I need to be clear here, for me, cannabis wasn't a ""high"", it was a tool to activate my parasympathetic nervous system. It was like putting brake fluid in a car that had none. It mechanically forced my nervous system to calm down enough so I could actually think.
In that new quiet, I found real tools. Once the alarm wasn't blaring 24/7, I stumbled into mindfulness. Then meditation. Then yoga and long bike rides. I realized these weren't just good habits, they were active ways to recenter my body. The bike rides weren't just exercise, they were a way to burn off the trapped stress energy from poor coping mechanisms stemming from a traumatic childhood. I was finally giving my body what it had been desperately needing.
I gave my busy brain a mission. I started reading, voraciously, about things that fascinated me. I started working on a personal project. This gave my restless mind a positive problem to solve, so it stopped chewing on my own anxiety.

The cannabis wasn't the hero of the story. I was. The plant was just a key that unlocked a door. These days, it‚Äôs just another integrated part of my toolkit, like my morning coffee. I don't see it as something to phase out, any more than I'd phase out the reading glasses I need to see clearly, or insulin I also need to survive daily.

The point of all this isn't that you should use cannabis. The point is that you have the right to build your own path. Reject the dogma of the binary.  

Getting sober from alcohol didn't feel like jumping off a party barge to be lost at sea. It felt like I was finally building a raft to sail toward a shore I could see, a shore with peace that was always there, waiting for me. I landed. And you can too, in your own way. Find what helps you settle yourself first, so you can find the path that is uniquely yours to walk. 

I'm sharing this because I know what it's like to feel like an outsider in your own recovery. If this resonates with you, know that you're not broken, and you're not alone. There is a back door. You can find it.

1nwyt43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1nwyt43/is_caffeine_bad_for_overall_health/,Is caffeine bad for overall health?,"I was surprised to learn that the dont-die man doesn‚Äôt consume any caffeine

But what about yerba mate? It can provide over 1,000 mg more polyphenols than green tea, boost fat burning, and help lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. And coffee? It‚Äôs linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and is loaded with antioxidants

And it's not only him, lately I‚Äôve noticed more people cutting out all caffeine sources. I often see posts like ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had coffee for 30+ days and I feel great.‚Äù They usually say the first three days are the hardest, but then it gets easier. Still, I don‚Äôt fully understand why so many people choose to stop drinking coffee in the first place

What intrigues me most is that people interested in longevity avoid yerba mate. It's literally superfood, packed with antioxidants, vitamins, and benefits

That said, in the past five days, I had two nights where I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep: I went to bed before 10 p.m. but didn‚Äôt fall asleep until 3 a.m., then woke up at 5 a.m. (an hour before my alarm). Both times, I had consumed yerba mate earlier that day. I find it hard to imagine giving it up, since I'm aware of its benefits, but I also know how crucial consistent, sufficient sleep is for health and longevity

If caffeine can disrupt sleep even slightly, I‚Äôd be willing to give it up, even though I love coffee, yerba, tea, and matcha. I always stop consuming caffeine by noon, so in theory I shouldn‚Äôt have trouble falling asleep ten hours later..

So here‚Äôs my question: When it comes to longevity and overall health, is it better to keep drinking caffeine sources like yerba, matcha, and coffee for their countless benefits‚Äîor cut them out completely to protect sleep and recovery?",7,1759497234.0,Biohackers,22,1.0,False

My hands were constantly occupied with keyboards and screens  but never really producing anything real. 

Then my neighbor said he'd been crafting little wooden boxes in his garage. Something about being able to work with his hands he said. The aroma of sawdust. The feeling of creating something from the ground up.

I was doubtful. I'd never been the crafty kind of person. But over the weekend I found myself at the hardware store purchasing my first piece of pine wood and a simple hand saw .

What followed surprised me utterly.

The initial project was crude  just a plain wooden box that seemed to have come out the other end of a minor earthquake. But when I put down the sandpaper after finishing the last corner and put on the stain something snapped. For the first time in months my head was utterly silent. No frantic thoughts of deadlines or emails. Just me the wood and the soothing motion of crafting something tangible. 

The science supports this as well. Research indicates that handwork actually decreases cortisol levels and induces the same meditative response as mindfulness exercises. Who would have thought that therapy had a cedar scent to it?

Three months in I've constructed a coffee table several picture frames and even a tiny bookshelf. My apartment's coming along now and is filled with items that hold the satisfaction of having been built by my own hands.

The best part You don't have to have a fancy workshop and high-dollar tools to get started.

I started with only a folding table in my living room and simple hand tools. No power tools no workshop  just a desire to learn something new. Every little project teaches you something new and before you know it you're working through problems and making solutions with your own two hands. 

There's something deeply satisfying about transforming a raw piece of wood into something functional and beautiful. It's like meditation therapy and accomplishment all rolled into one sawdust covered package .

Anyone else discovered an unexpected hobby that completely changed their perspective? Sometimes the best things come from just trying something completely outside your comfort zone.",2,1759497200.0,Woodworkingplans,4,0.58,False

Beneath earth and bedrock

Must be more comfy than my sheets

And smell less of you

Situations I'll get myself into once I get up

And maybe the next time I see you

I'll break through the static

And next time I'll tell you something I really feel



Couldn't we just get 10 coffees or one beer

Enough to take the edge off the razor on my ear

But piercings are only cool

If you pay someone who has the tools

To put them to proper use on my head



I feel stupid and I must look stupider

I point and laugh at the man in the mirror

I haven't really spoken much to him

I should ask him how he's doing

But he'll just say, man I could really use some sleep right about now

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

‚ÄúSafe and happy, they sang ‚Äòding dong the witch is dead‚Äô when they heard about Xanadu. I would like John to take over that place when this is over. Make something good out of it. You heard of Halden?‚Äù

‚Äúshitt yeah. Jimmy lived there, damn it. Fuck, I‚Äôm going to kill those bastards. His daughter was almost finished with university. She studies here, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúJimmy?‚Äù

‚ÄúJimmy Harris, a retired teacher, I knew way back. He retired at Halden. Brightest smiled, and the worst BBQ you could ever imagine, but the best homebrewed beer to make up for it. Good damn it. He had three grown-up kids. The oldest lived down south, and his youngest was living with him.‚Äù She said, she smiled weakly, remembering the good times. Adam got up and got them two glasses of whiskey.

‚ÄúTo Jimmy and all the other lost souls of Halden. May‚Ä¶ may their souls pass gently into the night.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo Jimmy, may you reach the holy lands you dreamt of.‚Äù She replied, and they drank.

Adam sight, ‚ÄúHoly lands. All of this is because of the holy lands beyond the gate. I was made a caregiver, and the ugly heads of greed and corruption turned their heads to me. This feels like a damn mythological war. Good against evil.‚Äù He said, looking at the empty glass.

‚ÄúAt least it's clear who's good and who's evil. So what are you going to do?‚Äù

Adam thought for a moment, then an idea formed in his head. ‚Äúcheat‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to cheat.‚Äù

She looked at him, then smiled. ‚ÄúGood, if they don‚Äôt play fair, then there is no point in playing fair back right.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, go back to your quarters. I will let Evelyn know where you are, and hopefully I can solve this stupid war quickly and get John Mo back home safely.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen I want to kill them, they took John and my kids, Adam. You think I will let that pass?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, but revenge is a dish best served cold like the winter. I will give you your revenge; however, you have to wait. So go and wait. Evelyn will call you soon.‚Äù

She stood up and nodded.¬† ‚ÄúAnd you tried to hide from us. You‚Äôre a king, Adam. You always were, now go save us from them.‚Äù Then she left, and he looked after her. Once she was gone, Sig-San sat down as the camouflage suite turned off, and he removed the hooded mask.

‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are corrupt and greedy. We use that against them. We link them to Halden with money trails and communications. Halden was eighty percent human. Then we have them impeached and replaced with our men.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat will take time. The gate is closed, so how do we get down?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, you know which gate we use. And you pick up Kira‚Äôs kids and do a prison break for John Mo.¬†¬† I will ask Grandfather to provide a crew for that. Have a backup in case he turns.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf he has turned?‚Äù

‚ÄúThen do it quickly and painlessly, he is too big a risk to keep alive if they turned him. But I have a feeling he is not. If you get Kira‚Äôs kids, then he isn‚Äôt turned.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow many teams?‚Äù

‚ÄúI will tell him five, but we sent sixteen. Six as sleepers in case everything goes south. Have Arus and Knug put together a team, too, to deal with the impeachment.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm guessing you have something extra?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Roks have made a lot of friends in the human navy. We need those admirals to be ready to back an impeachment. If I can convince them to do it internally, then we can end this before it becomes hot.‚Äù Adam said.

‚ÄúI know, we have about two months before we can expect any of their loyal fleets to appear at our border. So, you don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù

Sig-San nodded, stood up, and left. Adam turned to the computer and set up a secure line, and soon Evelyn picked up he informed her about Kira and then spoke with some of the kids, Wei, and Chriss, and some of the teenagers had gone sailing with a few chaperons. There were even a few kids from Halden who were blissfully unaware of what had happened. Adam promised to send some crisis workers to help with them. When the conversation was finished, he took a few moments to calm and center himself before calling up the next one on his list.¬† This one would take a few hours before he would answer, so Adam went back to work while he waited.

Three hours and two cups of coffee later, the line beeped, and he turned to see Admiral Christofer Blackthorne. He smiled as he looked at him; he was not alone, but instead, three other officers were sitting around a table looking at him. Adam simply nodded and transferred it to the holoprojector, then went to the small meeting room and sat down, looking at them.

‚ÄúI suspect you're all updated on what has happened here? About Halden?‚Äù Adam said as he sent the latest report, which included the surveillance recordings.¬†

‚ÄúYes, we are aware, and we regret it. The navy did not sanction it.‚Äù Christofer said, and Adam nodded.

‚ÄúWe suspect that much; it was committed by a pirate group here. They are using the war as an excuse to attack us directly. It makes them an enemy fleet and not pirates. But I know the Mustha Mugga was south for a while, and the question is if your leadership sanctioned the use of this pirate fleet to attack us and focus on civilian targets.‚Äù¬† Adam replied, and Christofer looked around the table.

‚ÄúWe have some evidence that points in that direction. We can prove they sanctioned the fleet to fight on EUC‚Äôs behalf, as you managed to get the three fleets there to change sides. As for how to attack and what targets, we cannot link to the administration.‚Äù A commander replied.

Adam looked at him, the name, rank, and some intel popped up, courtesy of Sig-San spy network.

‚ÄúCommander Wolf, right? If you already have them linked to hiring pirates to attack me, pirates who have already tried this same trick on Dirt, then why isn‚Äôt this dealt with? Yes, we are at war, unfortunately. A war I‚Äôm trying to stop.‚Äù He looked at all of them. ‚ÄúYou know damn well what will happen if those bastards find out you're having a communication with me without a representative from their diplomatic corps. So, let's just speak freely. Are you all okay with this?‚Äù

They looked at each other, and one of them smirked slightly. ‚ÄúWe are already traitors to them. I had family at Halden.‚Äù

Adam looked at him. Rear Admiral Beaumont was not lying; his brother was on the casualty list. Halden had been a place where many had retired.

Adam nodded and looked at Christofer. ‚ÄúOkay, Kira dropped by, and she told me they got John Mo. I‚Äôm sending a team to pick him up. Can you arrange the bust? I would like to reunite the family here.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat can be arranged. I guess you want our intel as well?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, I want you to seek out and check the fleet commanders. I want to end this war peacefully.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúImpeachment. However, when it does happen, they need the fleet to support them. If they succeed, I will immediately sue for peace.‚Äù

Adam looked at them as they cut the audio to discuss the matter. He spent the time to go over the intel of these men, they all had something to lose or had already lost something in this short time. Only Christoffer was the loose card, after a few minutes, they turned the audio back on.

‚ÄúOkay. That can work. What about the land beyond the gate?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can't give anybody free access.¬† There are more planets than you have seen, but if we bring greed and corruption in, then they will close the gate and take away our tech. They already did it to a far more advanced immortal race.¬† I‚Äôm trying to do this the right way.‚Äù Adam said, and Christofer stroked his chin as he thought.

‚ÄúThe elder race? The Elohim? It makes sense. We will make arrangements. Give us a week and we will get back to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you all, I can ask for.‚Äù Adam replied, ‚ÄúHopefully, Halden will be the last casualty of this pointless war. I will look forward to your results.‚Äù

¬†Then he cut the line and leaned back in the chair. Something felt off. He sat up again and looked at the files of the men. Wolf had a father in Admiral Hicks' fleet and had been trained by him. Adam kept digging and then found it. His wife was working for the ceo of a travel agency owned by Baagh Nigam. Adam sent Christofer the file discreetly. Hopefully, he got to it before Wolf did something bad.

Someone help me,"Okay.. I quit sugar and processed flours and gluten a month+ ago and I was getting so frustrated thinking I should‚Äôve lost more than just 2kg. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, sugar free life is amazing for skin and energy and focus etc but I thought I‚Äôd be a different size by now hahaha. Anyway.. I realised I‚Äôm still consuming 2000+ kcal a day! (I should be around 1500-1600). It‚Äôs because I seem to have replaced all my treats with cream in my eggs, cream in my coffee, cream stuffed dates, halloumi stuffed dates, lots of dates stuffed with 90% dark chocolate.. occasional pancakes made with oats and banana and.. cream.. lol. We‚Äôre talking pure fat unsweetened thick cream. I‚Äôve also been replacing bread with a ton of fries and Mayo and it‚Äôs all a mess. 

I recognise this all now and I tried to remove all my extras and now life tastes so sad. I know this is ridiculous because tons of people live life on whole foods and enjoy it but is it true, do people actually live life without their daily dose of dessert or do I have to remove my lattes and Cortados and switch to green tea and black coffee? If I do a bunch of swaps and eliminations, what would be left is: 

Breakfast: 3 scrambled eggs cooked in a little olive oil and black coffee 
Lunch: my usual cauliflower and beet root and sweet potato salad with 1/4 rotisserie chicken 
Post-lunch: green tea and sadness 
Dinner: some combination of protein, veg and a controlled portion of rice or potatoes. 

Is that sustainable? I am female with 20kg to lose early 30s with a LOT of emotional eating to deal with lol. But I guess my question is.. do people just eat for fuel and that‚Äôs it? Is this my only solution? Remove the decadence and sweetness from my entire life? I‚Äôm talking in permanent terms because I‚Äôm looking for a sustainable solution.

1nwyjap,https://i.redd.it/jb3hhs7mawsf1.jpeg,Learn How to Actually Study Before it‚Äôs too late,"Think about this:

Student B studies 4 hours every single day.
They sacrifice sleep, rarely see friends, and still struggle to keep a B average.
Their notebooks are full of highlighted text, hours are wasted rereading chapters‚Ä¶ and yet, their results don‚Äôt match the effort.

What‚Äôs the real difference here?
It‚Äôs not intelligence.
It‚Äôs not dedication.
It‚Äôs not luck.
It‚Äôs how they study, not how long they study.

Now let me ask: if you had to rate your own study method from 1‚Äì10‚Ä¶ what number would you give yourself?

The Night That Changed Everything

I once studied for 12 hours straight for a psychology exam. Coffee cups everywhere, perfect notes, every chapter reread. I thought I was doing it right.

But I failed. Badly.
That night I realized: I had no clue how to actually study effectively.

And it made me wonder: how many of us are mistaking ‚Äúhours at the desk‚Äù for ‚Äúknowledge in the brain‚Äù?

The Productivity Illusion

Be honest:
	‚Ä¢	Have you ever highlighted so much your textbook looked like abstract art?
	‚Ä¢	Reread the same paragraph 20 times hoping it would finally stick?
	‚Ä¢	Taken beautiful notes you never looked at again?

We confuse effort with results. And here‚Äôs the painful part: school never teaches us that studying isn‚Äôt about time, it‚Äôs about strategy.

So ask yourself are you actually learning, or just looking busy?

The Consumption Trap

We believe the more pages we read, videos we watch, hours we cram the more we‚Äôll learn.

But the brain isn‚Äôt a sponge. It‚Äôs a muscle. It needs the right kind of training and rest.

Here‚Äôs the formula that flipped everything for me:
Real Learning = Information √ó Retention Rate

If you study 5 hours but only retain 10%, that‚Äôs basically 30 minutes of learning.
If you study 1 hour but retain 50%, you‚Äôve learned the same in less time.

So why are so many people still flexing how long they studied instead of how much they retained?

The Switch: Active Learning

When I switched to active learning practice questions, teaching concepts out loud, applying info my retention shot up from 10% to 70%.

Passive studying? It‚Äôs like pouring water into a bucket full of holes. Active learning? It patches the holes so the water stays.

That‚Äôs when my study time dropped in half, and my grades went from B‚Äôs and C‚Äôs to straight A‚Äôs.


The Study Plan That Actually Works
	1.	Study in 30‚Äì60 min chunks.
	2.	Test yourself before reviewing.
	3.	Focus on weak spots, not comfort topics.
	4.	Use active methods: questions, flashcards, explaining.
	5.	Connect ideas together.
	6.	Quick review before bed (sleep locks it in).

Now go back to the score you gave your own study method at the start.
Does it still deserve that number?
Or did you just realize you might be wasting hours without results?

So here‚Äôs the real question for you:

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it‚Äôs time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero‚Äôs journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can‚Äôt even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don‚Äôt wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

My family ""jokes"" they don‚Äôt see me anymore. I‚Äôve been obsessed with building stuff people actually want to use.

I‚Äôm a product designer who also loves to code. Somewhere along the way that turned into a bit of an addiction: taking problems that feel boring, painful, or repetitive, and trying to make them fun and effortless.

My first project almost broke me: 12 months of grinding, a lot of money burned, and countless mistakes. But I couldn‚Äôt stop. So I started another one.

This project is about to launch (in beta). At its core it‚Äôs an AI-powered accounting home for modern businesses. Not another clunky tool with endless forms, but something that actually cuts away the boring parts so people can focus on their real work. I‚Äôve been running businesses for the last 15 years, so I know my way around accounting and invoices. But building something for an international focus - with all the different rules, currencies, and workflows: that‚Äôs a whole other challenge.

**Think:**

* No more wasting hours typing receipts 
* No more chasing late payments 
* No more dashboards that make your eyes glaze over

And no more boring, blue-themed accounting app either. (Why is it that once you‚Äôre B2B accounting software, everything suddenly has to be blue?)

Instead you drop in whatever you have (a receipt, some numbers, a pasted text) and it just sorts itself out into invoices, expenses and client records. What used to take minutes of manual input takes seconds.

For anyone curious about the build: it‚Äôs running on Laravel, Vue, Inertia, and Tailwind. I‚Äôll share more details when the private beta opens up. A waitlist is coming soon (next week?) and later a beta for freelancers, agencies and small businesses who want to try it early.

""wanna ride?"" Taxi cab cruising slowly window cracked open.  
""No I think i'm going to visit a friend.""  
  
""Johnny are you home?"" Noone was there, I let myself in. A one story wooden house spacey and simple.  
Made a coffee and the sound of a v8 motor came bursting aggressively through the walls and windows.

""Can't be good for the old fella""  
""Lost his job and mum left him the same week.""

We looked down at our coffee.  
""Wanna help me paint?""  
""Yeah why not?"" I volunteered.  
His sister Mary walked in from the street ""Is Dad up yet?""  
""No he'll be sleeping in, Bender.""  
""We've got to find him a job or he's going to go mad.""  
  
The deck in his back yard was well built.

""So how's work?""

""scored some primo hash, wanna smoke?""

""Oh you must be the shitkicker father, did you not teach your son to be a man?""  
""Fuck you arsehole ""He picked up the whole can of paint and threw it at my face.  
""Ah, get your Dad under control."" I shouted.  
Johnny took a swing at me but missed.  
His father exchanged blows with me until we were both exhausted, he fell down on the dusty ground and opened his cigarette pack. I positioned myself to kick him in the head as hard as I could, but I stopped seeing just how sick he was. Instead I said.  
""You even gave up the fight so you could feed your smoking habit. And your dying!""¬†  
""Ill get my shotgun"" Johnny ran into the house¬†  
  
I ran toward the back gate that connected onto another adjoining to the hospital. Tripped on the last step and hurt my shoulder.  
""Go get fucked losers, where do you think you are, this is not some fucking slum. you are not gangsters or clever hustlers, you are Shit kickers."" I screamed this until every internal organ stung.  
  
As I walked into the street, my head bleeding. I looked right to where the road would take me home, and looked back up toward the hospital, maybe it was the paint fumes, but it seemed that the six story building(hospital) was grinning down at me.

üëâ Some live as **PIMO** (Physically In, Mentally Out), forced to play along while carrying doubts inside.  
üëâ Others have been **disfellowshipped**, cut off from family and friends, facing loneliness and silence.

The struggles are real ‚Äì but how we respond to them can change everything.  
Here‚Äôs a little story that illustrates this:

A daughter once complained to her father that life was miserable.  
She was tired of working and struggling.  
‚Äì ‚ÄúEvery time I solve one problem,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúanother one just appears.‚Äù

Her father, who was a cook, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed them on the stove.

When the water began to boil, he put potatoes in one pot, eggs in another, and coffee beans in the third. Without saying a word, he let them boil for a while.

The daughter sighed impatiently. After twenty minutes, her father turned off the burners. He placed the potatoes in a bowl, the eggs in another, and poured the coffee into a cup.

‚Äì ‚ÄúWhat do you see?‚Äù he asked.  
‚Äì ‚ÄúPotatoes, eggs, and coffee,‚Äù she answered quickly.

He told her to touch the potatoes ‚Äì they were soft.  
Then he asked her to peel an egg ‚Äì it was hard inside.  
Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee ‚Äì its aroma made her smile.

‚ÄúBut what does it mean, father?‚Äù she asked.

He explained:  
‚Äì All three faced the same adversity: boiling water. But each reacted differently.  
The potato, once strong and firm, became soft and weak.  
The egg, fragile at first, became hard inside.  
But the coffee beans were unique ‚Äì they didn‚Äôt just change themselves, they transformed the water into something new.

# Applied to the ex-JW experience

Life inside the organization can feel like boiling water.

* Some, like potatoes, lose their strength and feel crushed under the pressure.
* Some, like eggs, become hardened and bitter from the pain.
* But some choose to be like coffee beans ‚Äì they use adversity to create something new: freedom, self-respect, and even compassion for others who suffer the same way.

# The message

We cannot control the challenges life throws at us ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs shunning, loneliness, or living a double life.  
But we can decide **how we respond**.

So the question is:  
üëâ Will you be a potato, an egg‚Ä¶ or a coffee bean?

I work from home on Fridays. Every other day I have to go into the office which is like a 45 minute commute by train because I live in the suburbs and work in the main city. Fridays, my absolute favorite day because of work from home. My daughter gets on the bus an hour and a half before I have to login to work. After she gets on the bus, I tidy up the house, I change the sheets in our bedroom, I listen to podcast or music on the speaker all while enjoying my coffee. This morning I went to make an espresso with my new espresso machine that I absolutely love, it is part of my ritual. Lately the weather has been cooling which was getting me excited for hot pumpkin lattes. It truly brings me so much joy. 

I start grinding the beans into the porta filter, and hear an empty grating noise, no problem.l - I‚Äôll fill it from the canister. I grab the canister for beans and we‚Äôre completely out. 
I was absolutely devastated!  Literal tears were coming out of my eyes and I‚Äôm seething at my husband who‚Äôs in the bathroom downstairs after his espresso shot from earlier this morning. 

I know this sounds small, but this is something that I so look forward to not having to leave anywhere in the morning to grab coffee and just having a quiet morning at home on Fridays. 

My husband works for himself, so he‚Äôs home all week during the week and in and out of the house and he makes many espressos. I am so pissed that he didn‚Äôt see the end of the beans and text me like hey we‚Äôre gonna be out pickup beans himself ha. 
Got pissy with him and said next time the beans are empty to let me know.  He said he has no way of knowing so he doesn‚Äôt know how to let me know that we‚Äôre out. Womp womp. Well I feel better getting that out.

1nwy6ri,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1nwy6ri/no_hug_after_second_date/,No hug after second date‚Ä¶,"I apologize for the long post lol. 

I met someone who lives an hour away. So the last two dates have been dinner dates. I initially suggested coffee for the first date, but she said she doesn‚Äôt do coffee dates with strangers, etc. She wanted to have a conversation. She is from Belarus, but has been here for about 20+ years now. So sometimes she is direct, and I am not sure if thats a cultural thing or not. 

When we first met, I felt I could go for a quick hug, which sometimes I do. She quickly gave me the signal she was not interested in that. Dinner went ok, lots of conversation, etc. No hug or anything after we finished. So we met again last night, and the conversation got a little awkward. Basically she thinks she is a challenge for me, and I just want to get to the ‚Äúend‚Äù, which is relationship/sex. Ok, I get that. I can be a little direct. Backstory, I was pretty quick to setup a date initially (which she felt was ‚Äúhurried‚Äù), and then I asked for a second date pretty quickly, because I knew she was going back to work for the weekend, and was hoping to see her before she went back to work. Plus, we talked about my recreational tennis hobby and I‚Äôve talked about how competitive it is, and how competitive I like to be. So she has taken all this information and thinks she is a challenge for me to ‚Äúwin‚Äù. 

Another slight problem, I paid for the nice dinner the first time, and even paid for the more casual dinner last night. Then we went for ice cream. I feel that she could have offered to pay for the ice cream, as she got hers first, and could have easily suggested ‚ÄúI got his‚Äù. So I feel it‚Äôs always going to be the ‚Äúguy pays for everything‚Äù situation. 

Also, she has not mentioned driving to come see me. So I am starting to seethese as signs that it might be ‚Äúher way, or the highway‚Äù for lack of a better term. 

But after the awkward, somewhat intense conversation about how it should be about the journey, and not the end, we called it a night, and I went for a side hug as we were walking to our cars, and she say ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs too soon‚Äù

I am starting to think this ‚Äútest‚Äù of hers is too much. It honestly wasn‚Äôt fun having that awkward conversation and then being denied a simple hug doesn‚Äôt help either. What‚Äôs it going to take to get a kiss. 

A part of me wants to just wish her the best. It‚Äôs hard to figure out who she actually is when she is being this way, or is this who she is.

I kind of get into these weird food ruts where I will literally eat the same thing every day for months and months. That is how I get with the egg white turkey bacon sandwich. That being said, it's not always convenient (or cost effective) to drive out daily to get this item. Yes, I could make a close dup at home, but I'm also really weird about cooking so I probably wouldn't bother. 

So, my question - world there ever be a way that SB would sell like a box of the frozen sandwiches in bulk? Obviously I could give advance notice so the store could account for that with their inventory and food ordering, but I wasn't sure if that could even be an option. I used to work at a different coffee chain (caribou) and we used to do that for things like syrups and stuff. I feel like our registers had a button to ring in bulk food sales, but I can't remember using it. If anyone who currently works at SB could let me know, that would be awesome.

I love¬†[Italy](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/italy/). I love almost everything about the place. I love the taste of gelato in the sun in Calabria, I love the sweetly sad mistiness of Venice in winter. I love Ragusa, Palermo, Lecce, Genoa. I love the northern fringes where Italy melds with Germany and the Slavic world, creating the strangeness of Trieste, Bolzano, Gorizia.  
  
I also love Italians, and whenever I go there, which is quite often as a lucky travel writer, I marvel at the general smiling charm of them all. Italians seem to be born two¬†[Aperol Spritzes](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/food-and-drink/cocktails/perfect-aperol-other-spritz-recipes/)¬†ahead of everyone else in their genial and ebullient good mood, and they have a near unique gift of putting you at ease. Also, the food rocks, the girls are pretty, the art and architecture is peerless, the landscapes are often divine and the Italians instinctively understand the correct usage of coffee.  
  
All of which makes it sad that I have to say, after a slew of¬†[recent trips all over the country](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/how-to-be-the-sort-of-tourist-italians-love/)¬†‚Äì to Florence, Naples, Sicily, and others ‚Äì **I have realised that Italy is dying**. And it is dying in a way that has some profound lessons for the rest of us.  
  
This observation came to me in¬†[Sardinia](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sardinia/), last week. I was on assignment to Barbagia, a haunted, epic, lush, storied corner of a remarkable island. My itinerary took me to little villages perched on impossible cliffs gazing out at the glittering Tyrrhenian Sea. It took me to whispering vineyards where they‚Äôve been growing vines for millennia. In ancient forests I found shepherds speaking Sardinian, probably the nearest language to Latin. Talking to these men is as linguistically close as you can get to talking to Cicero or Caesar. In short, Sardinia was as beautiful as I expected, but in one way it was entirely shocking.  
  
**Why? Because it is so old and there are so few children.** The numbers back this up. Sardinia had just 0.91 children per woman in 2023. That means the island has the lowest fertility rate in Italy,¬†[itself one of the world‚Äôs least fertile nations](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2025/01/13/zero-babies-born-in-358-italian-towns-amid-birth-crisis/). Every single Sardinian province now has a fertility rate below one child per woman, with women becoming first-time mothers at age 33.2 years, the oldest in the country.The ageing crisis is equally dramatic. **The average age has risen to 48.8 years. For every child, there are now 7.4 elderly people, compared to just one elderly person per child in 1951.** Emigration only adds to these problems as young Sardinians disappear, creating a doom loop where the exodus of young people shrinks the customer base and stifles economic vitality.  
  
What‚Äôs more, you can¬†*feel*¬†this ageing and this childlessness. When the beach crowds vanish and the mainlanders fly away, Sardinia is like one giant, if lovely, care home for oldsters. As I drove through town after town, I kept seeing those normal gaggles of old men you get in dusty Mediterranean squares, playing cards, gossiping, necking wine at 9am. Except in Sardinia the gaggles have become armies, great platoons of pensioners, like the birds multiplying on wires in Hitchcock‚Äôs¬†*The Birds*. And there are barely any children.  
  
Is this all reversible? One hopes so, naturally. The Italian government is doing its damnedest to¬†[boost the birth rate](https://archive.ph/o/5vE8s/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/04/19/italian-minister-says-country-risks-ethnic-replacement/). But **if it fails, and if the Italians don‚Äôt start making more Italians quite soon, then the most charming people in the world will fade away to oblivion**. Which is quite a sobering thought for the rest of us, as birthrates around the world copy the Italian pattern, the way we once copied their cooking, their art and their enviable way of life.",10,1759495485.0,Natalism,1,0.86,False

1nwy0ie,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1nwy0ie/rf_kettletop/,[RF] Kettletop,"Through the dim yellow light with our picks and shovels. Equipment to help us hold up and stabilize the cave. It was often a fight between the aggressive among us to who owned what.

Reminding us of old gold miners fighting over a tiny nugget.

Dust kicks up at my pick strike a few more centimeters deeper. Unconvering an ancient ocean fossil.

We stopped for a break, was it friday optimism or were we getting close to discovering what was inside the pit.





The specialist woman, twenty six year old Charlotte told the story.

""In the past much of this area we are standing on belonged to the Cretaceous era, we are hoping to find the remains of any marine animal, it's not just a pay day. For those of you working for the university you will suddenly have new credentials, your names will have weight.""

 All of us hung on her words.



As we went back to digging with a fresh sense curiosity.

A guilty tickets for the lottery feeling.

That day we found nothing.

Leaving the site at 16pm as the sun was setting passing all of the attempts to dress the city in something it was not. The north such a piece of perfection unto itself. A reason suicide was popular, not the lack of vitamin D?



How can a sense of humor and boasting merge to be the socal proof of a man. Looking at the hired help, all unquestioning sports fanatics in their late twenties. Shit kickers who didn't care about reaching the find, simply there for their hourly rate or piece work.

""I can drink three bottles of whiskey."" One said.

""I had to fight five men at once"" Another.

It was like they were talking themselves up so they might survive a quiet evening at the local tavern.

I wouldn't join the crew at the bar on that weekend. I couldn't face the lonliness of my small thirty five meter apartment in Kiruna, I rode back down to the site and spend the afternoon and early night digging there. 



Yellow lantern light lighting up this part of the cave, resembling an old shed with hardened clay floors.

Each pick blast hardly scratching the surface. My body shuddering.

I head back home before ten as a few of the other diggers were leaving the local tavern.

""You've been digging again, you crazy old man!"" They could see the gear I was carrying.

I never replied. The universe is different for the silent, for they just observe and let conclusions mature over time. Absent from the response. overtime the ear picks up small but audible tones of fear in their last syllables.



The one they called the gardener always boasting. The Broms, exquisite twins both with symmetrical beauty and sharp wits.

I got to the job again on monday unpacking my gear on the floor, the three of them approached me.

""what were you doing on saturday night? Did you really go to the dig by yourself?""

""Yeah I just want to make some progress so we can start studying this thing"" The low volume of my voice had them lean in further, my tone was cordial yet assertive.



The gardener pointed to where I'd been working. ""He's reached the top of the fossil, might have to bring in the pointing trowels"" He said making my small progress into an opportunity to project his self loving charisma, he spoke as if teasing himself. Do they learn this from their fathers?



The broms twins Lynn and Leah congratulated me and dished out coffee to all of us. The rest of team would be here soon, so making a little more progress together deeper would hide the fact I didn't have a life.

By the end of the day it was obvious we were dealing with a crustacean identified and estimated to have lived ten million years to the Miocene, I was ecstatic. The gardener didn't look very impressed though.

with the exception of the twins their faces bitter as if losing a competition.



Gardener's accusing tone lost all charisma.""All this work for some old crab not ten million years old, I thought you said this area was from the cretaceous."" The Charlotte said nothing. 

The hired hands and I continued digging, the twins went to get renkott for an early dinner, Charlotte joined them. When they got back the hired hands were gone. It was just me.

I looked up smiling despite my stinging wrists and exhausted arms.

They asked in an accusatory tone ""The dig is only ten million years old, why are you so happy?""

""This is everyones first dig is it not?"" I questioned.

The girls admitted with anticipation.

""Why do you want to suddenly have the best dig on your first attempt?""

""Well so we can make names for ourselves"" Charlotte said bluntly.



Something stirred in the twins, Lynn spoke up ""You mean it's a good start.""

I said nothing, ate my last mouthfull of reindeer meat and left.

My bicycle tyres appreciated the flat smooth roads of Kiruna. Life was sometimes like that.

A handful of grateful people might stop to observe and then delight such a reprieve from the rollercoaster life often is.



On my way home I got to the greatest gift of all, Kebnekaise the first light sprinklings of snow atop it.

I called it the couple because of the two separate peaks.

Darkness calmed me, I forgot the disappointment of this beautiful view disappearing.

Back to the small apartment to sleep off the compacted exhaustion.



The next morning I arrived, the twins had arrived before me. Looking dismayed.

Leah gave me the bad news ""Charlotte and gardener have left to go work on another dig.""

""They've officially signed off"" Lynn added.

""Is this dig ours then?"" I asked.

They nodded. 

""Any cowboys to dig out the periphery?""

""Yeah, but we are thinking of leaving too."" Almost simultaneous.

""Lets give it two days, Charlotte and Gardener will spend a week just setting up."" I used all my force to convince them.

Reluctantly the twins got to work as the few remaining hired hands began to arrive.

The work became more and more tedious the closer we got to the remains.

I knew the twins would blame me for wasting their time on a mediocre dig.

I decided to spare them and called the heritage board that afternoon to check the dig the following day.





I met the official early before the twins could arrive that wednesday morning.

Brush and trough in his hands, eyepiece attached to his head.

""So this is crustacean, dating back to the Miocene?"" The official tagged

I nodded.

He got down on one knee and instructed me to crouch as well. we started brushing together. The twins came in bemused.

""What is going on?"" Lynn asked

""We are analyzing the dig"" I answered as the official kept brushing and adjusting his eye piece.

He brushed continuously for a good 30 minutes.



Stood up, adjusted his pants, took off his eye piece, laid down the brush and affirmed, ""This find is not rare neither is it so ancient. However it is in incredible condition, this cave has provided protection. The museum will offer a high reward for this. You will be recieving commendations for this.""



The twins beamed with excitement. 



""Shall we inform Charlotte and Gardener?"" I tested, in my quiet voice.",1,1759495205.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

My grandmother fell and broke her hip three months ago. While she was in the rehab, I was going every single day and if I missed a day, she would call me saying I haven‚Äôt been there for a week. Now she is always telling me I haven‚Äôt been there for five days, six days, whatever when it‚Äôs been like two or three days. She asked me to come again today. She said she hasn‚Äôt seen me in so long when I saw her three days ago. And before that it was like three days before. I told her I‚Äôll come tomorrow when I can come without my toddler. She said she never gets to see my daughter. Which is so not true. I just feel like no matter how much I go there. It‚Äôs never enough for her. Even when I went to the rehab every single day, if I went in the morning and then Skip today, she would call me the next day saying I haven‚Äôt been there forever. I told her recently that it might feel like longer for her, but it does not make it reality. I never get to have time to see a friend ever. I‚Äôm in my early 30s and I have zero social life because I have to see my grandmother every chance I get. And what pisses me off the most is when she talks about me getting out of the house alone without my toddler and says it‚Äôs good for me and I need a break. But she‚Äôs talking about me coming to see her or take her to a store. Like it never crossed her mind that maybe me being in my early 30s would like to see a friend, my age once in a while. I even said it to her once and she acted like she just did didn‚Äôt hear me or understand. I just don‚Äôt understand how she could be so selfish to take all of my time. She doesn‚Äôt seem to care if I have time with my husband or if my child gets to play outside. We literally lived at the Rehab for over a month. With my child every day. I‚Äôm just fed up and I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm supposed to live like this. It‚Äôs just my mom and I taking care of her and the job is too big for two people. My mom is so fed up. She‚Äôs getting mad at everything My grandmother has ever done because my mom is just so worn out and overworked by her. My grandmother has severe OCD that‚Äôs never been treated or diagnosed. This is a woman who knows we are overworked and still has us doing things like returning really small items for her that we ourselves would just forget about and take the loss because we are busy. When she first got home, she was demanding I had to put a placemat down and her napkin had to be right and she needed her special coffee cup and all this ridiculous shit. When she was in the rehab, I had to be there every day to make sure her bed was made right. And I tell her she has mental illness and it‚Äôs affecting her recovery and she just will not accept it. She‚Äôs not willing to change anything that she hasn‚Äôt been forced to change by this. My mom goes to one grocery store, but my grandmother only will go to the other grocery store in their neighborhood. She has to buy certain things at Walmart, which is further away and takes a lot longer than the grocery store. I just don‚Äôt know how she has the balls to be so picky and exact about things when she‚Äôs depending on other people.

The thing that set my mom off really bad and led to my mom being upset about everything was after my mom took her to the movies to see a movie. My grandmother wanted to see, then my mom did a return for my grandmother in a store and then she picked up soft pretzels from an ice cream place for my grandmother . Then it was finally time for my mom to make a stop for herself for cigarettes at Wawa. she casually asked my grandmother if she wanted a hotdog. My mom was buying. Instead of saying yes, or no, my grandmother said yeah, but I don‚Äôt want one of those disgusting fat ones. And if they don‚Äôt have the thin ones, ask them to make them. And not set my mom off because my mother is exhausted by this woman. So my mom said no I‚Äôm not doing that, do you want a quesadilla? My grandmother said what‚Äôs a quesadilla? And I set my mom off. Again it‚Äôs not about the quesadilla, it‚Äôs about my mom being overworked by this woman. My mom explained it and my grandmother couldn‚Äôt give an answer and it pissed my mom off. My grandmother doesn‚Äôt get that it‚Äôs not just about the quesadilla. My mom is also annoyed because my grandmother has been in the world and in Mexican restaurants for 50 years and still doesn‚Äôt know what a quesadilla is.",7,1759495194.0,AgingParents,5,1.0,False

I‚Äôve done some digging already but I feel like I haven‚Äôt come across a lot of recommendations for seafood restos and cafes or maybe I‚Äôve just been looking in the wrong places. If you‚Äôve got any seafood spots to suggest (aside from Cev), I‚Äôd really appreciate it. Same for coffee. Mondayyy‚Äôs is on my list, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs good.

Also, I‚Äôll be arriving around 8AM in Gen Luna, but hotel check-in isn‚Äôt until 2PM. Any ideas on where I can hang out or maybe even nap a little? I‚Äôm expecting to be super sleepy since my flight from mnl is at 12AM. üò≠

Thanks in advance!

tldr:
- need recos for good seafood restos 
- need recos for cafes/coffee spots
- I‚Äôll arrive in Gen Luna at 8AM, but check-in still at 2PM. Need recos for where to go while waiting, especially when sleepy

1nwxvtr,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberandchill/comments/1nwxvtr/speed_wins_how_to_build_momentum_before_lunch/,Speed Wins: How to Build Momentum Before Lunch,"# Speed Wins: How to Build Momentum Before Lunch

Speed creates luck. A focused morning turns scattered intent into shipped proof before noon. By the time meetings begin, your portfolio moved forward, your pipeline widened, and your next interview got closer. The goal is momentum you can feel by lunch and measure by week‚Äôs end.

# Morning velocity

Start the day with a clear runway. A calm room. A warm cup. A single plan written the night before. The morning favors people who move first. Use that window to bank progress while the world is quiet. Treat it like revenue time for your career.

# The sprint model

Work in a single ninety minute arc with three clean beats. Plan, execute, publish. The plan is one page at most. The execution is a focused build that proves one idea. The publish step closes the loop with a visible artifact. Keep the sprint light so you can finish on schedule, then carry the energy into the rest of the day.

In security or identity, a sprint might read like this. Plan a tiny improvement to an Entra tenant. Execute a quick change in a lab that demonstrates the idea. Publish a short log with a screenshot and a line that explains impact. The pattern stays the same even as the task changes.

# Decisions live at night

Small choices steal speed in the morning. Batch them the night before. Pick the cert section you will read. Choose the lab you will touch. Save a job description to tailor a resume line. Name the first keystroke on a sticky note and place it on your keyboard. The goal is to sit and move without debate.

# Pipeline before coffee cools

Send two applications while the kettle finishes. Keep a living resume that can be tailored in sixty seconds. Maintain a short list of roles in your lane. Focus on quality signals. Identity titles that mention Entra ID, Okta, SAML, or access reviews. Azure Security roles that reference AZ500, SC200, or control families. Make each application sharp and quick. The habit builds a steady cadence of conversations.

# Proof before meetings

Ship a lab log by ten in the morning. Keep it small and specific. One control adjusted. One policy confirmed. One diagram clarified. Add a caption that names why it matters. The log is a receipt that the day already moved your portfolio forward. It also acts as a warm up that makes later work smoother.

# Research has a ceiling

Reading can turn into delay. Give yourself a five link limit when you need context. Open those tabs, take notes for ten minutes, then build. The act of building reveals the next question and keeps you in motion. This keeps the sprint from drowning in prep and delivers something visible before noon.

# Templates are leverage

Create a bank of short templates that remove drag. A resume top third that matches your lane. A brief outreach note that links to a recent artifact. A post shell with slots for a screenshot, a one line summary, and two tags. Good templates do not force you into repetition. They give you a head start and protect your pace.

# Follow ups on rails

Momentum demands consistent touch points. Automate follow ups to send next Tuesday at nine in the morning. Let a calendar tool or a simple reminder system handle the nudge. Keep the message short. Thank you for the conversation. Here is the artifact we discussed. One sentence about the next step. The automation saves attention for the work that produces new proof.

# Close the loop

Every sprint should end with documentation and a share. Capture what changed, why you did it, and how to reproduce it at a high level. Store the note where you can find it later. Share a clipped version on your public profile with tags that match your niche. Identity, Entra ID, OIDC, conditional access. Azure Security, control sets, signals, automation. The loop is closed when the knowledge is written once for you and once for the outside world.

# Leave a breadcrumb

Write tomorrow‚Äôs first action on a sticky note. One sentence. Open the tenant and confirm a setting. Rewrite a resume line to match a target role. Draft a diagram that shows an auth sequence. Place it on the keyboard so your hand touches it at dawn. The breadcrumb removes friction and keeps the morning crisp.

# Ship before you stand

Never leave the desk without a shipped artifact. The artifact can be modest in size and still carry value. A screenshot that shows a meaningful change. A diagram that explains a flow. A bullet that quantifies a small improvement. A micro post with a line that teaches and a tag that helps the right eyes find it. Momentum is the sum of small finishes. One finish every morning builds a wall of evidence over a month.

# IAM through the lens of speed

Identity work rewards short loops. An Entra tenant can accept small upgrades that show well in a portfolio. Add a conditional access rule and log the change. Map a group strategy for one business unit and capture the diagram. Link a sample application and write a sentence about the flow. If you prefer vendor diversity, add a second provider to your lab over time and show the contrast in a clean table. Keep each move modest. Ship by ten.

# Azure Security in the same rhythm

Security controls shine when grouped into small sets. Pick a family and adjust one element in a lab. Note how a log signal reflects the change. Write one line that explains the outcome in clear language for leaders. Over time, pair the control with a second and a third so your portfolio shows a set that works together. The sprint remains the same. Plan, execute, publish. A small finish every morning becomes a body of work that feels confident in interviews.

# Resume that is always ready

Speed in applications requires a resume that can shift in minutes. Protect the top third. Keep a version aligned to identity and a version aligned to cloud security. Swap a few words, update one bullet to mirror a posting, and send. The daily habit of shipping artifacts feeds this with fresh lines that are easy to defend out loud.

# Outreach that respects time

Fast mornings welcome short messages. Share an artifact that relates to the person‚Äôs work. Ask one question that shows you understand their domain. Keep the note brief enough to read on a phone during a busy day. The goal is a steady stream of useful signals, not a pitch. Over weeks, this becomes a warm network that can carry a referral when the fit is real.

# Public profile that reflects motion

Pin two or three of your strongest artifacts. Create a feature section for your portfolio. Update a short headline that names your lane and your focus. Once a week, add the best of your morning work to the feed. Profiles that publish steady, useful proof pull in the right recruiters and make peer introductions easy.

# Guardrails for attention

Speed requires a quiet runway. Block distracting sites during the sprint window. Place the phone out of reach. Use a timer with visible numbers. Keep a notebook beside you for new questions so you do not open extra tabs. Save your environment settings so the room becomes quiet on cue each morning.

# The lunch test

By noon you should be able to point to three things. An application or two. A lab log that shows a tiny change and a reason. A public touch point that documents what you learned. The afternoon can hold meetings and heavier tasks. The morning already paid the tax that moves your career.

# Weekly cadence

A week of fast mornings should produce a visible set. Five lab logs. Five small artifacts posted. Ten targeted applications. Two follow ups sent on schedule. The count does not exist for vanity. It exists to surface the truth about inputs. Numbers you can see keep the habit honest.

# Scale without strain

Keep the rules simple so you can hold them during busy seasons. Ninety minute sprint. Five link ceiling. Two applications while coffee brews. One log before ten. Templates that save time. Follow ups scheduled once, then left alone. Sticky note for tomorrow. Ship before you stand. This rhythm fits inside a normal day and survives travel weeks and heavy projects.

# The compounding effect

Speed changes the way you read your own profile. It changes how your voice sounds in a mock interview. It changes which messages arrive in your inbox. Recruiters respond to visible proof. Peers respond to helpful posts. Hiring managers respond to candidates who can describe small wins with clarity. A month of fast mornings turns into a portfolio that opens doors.

# Start tomorrow

Set a ninety minute block on your calendar. Write the sticky note for your first action. Prepare two roles to apply to while the kettle boils. Pick the cert section and the lab touch you will pair. Put a template in reach for your lab log and for your post. Place the site blocker on a schedule. Then sleep.

By lunch tomorrow you will have shipped. Repeat this rhythm for four weeks and momentum will become your default.

My background check company doubles as one capable of hiding our secrets. It appears my efforts will be well worth it soon.

The Georgia acquisition will help in this regard.¬†

Now, about that transfer offer that was just accepted‚Ä¶ I believe they should be here the first two weeks of the new year. Yes. That will do nicely‚Ä¶

**Incubus**

We are at a set made to look like an Irish bar.¬† I have a very fetching skirt and half top on.¬† Green bra strap can be seen on my shoulders.¬† Jackie walks out in a dress that looks painted on.¬† Considering her chest, that is a sight to behold.¬†

‚ÄúOh momma!‚Äù¬† I don‚Äôt even realize I am saying it until it is out of my mouth.¬†

She laughs and walks up.¬† I get a kiss on the cheek and she says, ‚ÄúIf I hadn‚Äôt already seen you in less I would be hard pressed to think right now.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know why compliments from some people make me so much happier.¬† But she manages to make me smile every time she says hi to me, so this tracks.¬†

Ms. Wallace walks in and is discussing things with the photographer.¬† He gets everything ready and we do a set of wonderful pin-ups.¬† We touch cheek to cheek, have photos with us having drinks.¬† Coffee in branded cups, of course.¬† And we change into lingerie for a few shots.¬† It covers everything but damn if I am not having a hard time not staring at her.¬†

‚ÄúYou sure you aren‚Äôt part nymph?‚Äù

She laughs, ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs side has Verenestra.‚Äù

WELL FUCK.¬† ‚ÄúThat makes sense‚Ä¶‚Äù

She kisses my cheek.¬† ‚ÄúYou are hilarious.¬† We both know if this was Pat up here you‚Äôd be even more of a mess.‚Äù

I‚Ä¶.¬† fuck, she‚Äôs right.

**Very Hot Enlightened Human**

I almost cannot believe I am doing this.¬† But the practice was worth it.¬†  
I get to the stage where we have what looks like an Irish bar and there are two barstools. Almost exactly the same as the other one.¬† We have like 20 photos he wants to try to mirror what we did in the normal shoot.¬†

I have my robe on and Mona has hers as well.¬† I see Pat managed to con her way onto the set.¬† I give my lover a wink, she has already seen this all and Mona saw it once when he had a thing to see if we could work.¬† She couldn‚Äôt top me, but man that was a fun night.¬† Almost let me forget about being in love with Pat for a little bit.¬† Almost.

She winks at me.¬† ‚ÄúReady red?‚Äù

I laugh, she is literally red-skinned.¬† ‚ÄúBorn it, but you kinda deserve that nickname more.‚Äù

She shrugs and drops her robe.¬† Yep, completely nude demon in front of me.¬† She spreads her wings. Arches her back and stretches.¬† Even that tattoo on her belly only makes her hotter. It glows and pulses as if responding to something.

OH FUCK that is hard to handle.

I hear a breath catch.¬† Pat, you should not have come here.¬† Heh.¬† Poor gal is breaking herself. I wonder if she knew about the nipple piercings?

I drop my towel.¬† Mona looks at me and she zeros is on my puncture scar.¬†

‚ÄúI never did ask.¬† What happened there?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got sideswiped onto a fence saving Connie from a car.¬† I died.‚Äù

Mona looks upset.¬† ‚ÄúYou died?‚Äù

‚ÄúI got better.‚Äù¬† I shrug.

She laughs and then stops.¬† ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt joking.¬† How?‚Äù¬† She turns and looks at Pat.

Pat looks embarrassed.¬† ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs Mine, I told Thanatos to fuck off.‚Äù

Mona shakes her head.¬† ‚ÄúShe even fucking topped the grim reaper‚Ä¶‚Äù

I laugh.¬† ‚ÄúShe is all that. Wanna see a neat trick?‚Äù

Mona nods.

I then concentrate and ALL my hair ignites.¬† I wink at Mona.

‚ÄúOh by the nine hells, the carpet matches the curtains, literally.¬† I am immune to damage from fire, and I SO wanna test that right now‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMONA!‚Äù¬† hahahaha Pat is so shocked.¬† *Come on, she‚Äôs ALWAYS like this.*

Pat broadcasts back: *I was mainly upset she said what I was thinking*

I love that woman. I look at Mona, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt that kind of shoot.¬† Now let‚Äôs get into our poses.‚Äù

She laughs, ‚ÄúOne sec, can‚Äôt get upstaged.""¬† She concentrates and her tattoo begins glowing.¬† Everyone in the room feels it.¬† A massive dose of sexual energy hits us.¬† I see my biggest kink for a brief moment.¬† Pat smiles, even the photographer smiles.¬† ‚ÄúOoops, bit much, now I am charged.‚Äù

We do several shots and then I ask that we do them all again and I go fully into the form that is me with my power.¬† We have been calling it my fire imp mode.¬† We do the shots again and Mona is, indeed, immune to being hurt by me when she touched me for some of the poses.¬† Us cheek to cheek is so cute.¬† Although EVERY time I touch her I get a fantasy of mine come to mind.¬† Wow, that ink.

As we are getting robed again,, I have to ask her. ‚ÄúOkay, the ink...‚Äù

She laughs.‚Äù The remains of my soul? It forms a mark on the spot where my uterus and other parts I don‚Äôt have were""

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have kids?‚Äù¬† I am sad for her.¬† Wait.¬† I... huh.  This is new. Hold up. I think I might want kids.¬† Well, fuck, we could adopt, but I kinda want to have one for her.¬† Pat‚Äôs kid.¬† I mean she gave up one.¬† FUCK ME.

Mona shrugs at me.¬† ""Darling, I was in my early 40s when I died.¬† By that time if all the abortion concoctions hadn‚Äôt sterilized me, the STI that killed me or the eggs drying up did.¬† And it has been 2800 years... I think that well dried up long ago, gorgeous.‚Äù

She says it so casually, but I feel bad now.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Pat walks up after talking with the photographer and we both have robes back on.¬† ‚ÄúIf the other shoots are even half this good, this calendar is going to be the hottest selling thing in the First World.‚Äù

I kiss my lover.¬† ‚ÄúSo were you here to leer, cheer, or interfere?‚Äù

She looks at me.¬† ‚ÄúYes, Yes, and you just gotta let me know you intend to have fun with her.‚Äù¬† She winks.¬†

‚ÄúMs. Wallace, I hope you enjoyed the show.¬† I know I did.¬† I am sorry you might have felt the need to protect her.¬† My calling dibs on her was, in retrospect, in poor taste.¬† You are very lucky.‚Äù

She is still so fragile when it comes to me and Pat.¬† Pat looks at her, shakes her head and grabs Mona into a hug that almost makes me jealous.¬† I am envious for sure.¬† I wanna be in that hug.¬†

‚ÄúYou are wonderful, Mona.¬† Thank you for being so good.‚Äù¬† She grabs me after letting Mona go and hugs me like she did the hot incubus.¬† ‚ÄúYou looked like you needed this too.‚Äù

I sigh and everything is right in the world.

Pat pulls me back, looks me in the eyes and says, ‚ÄúWe are so making bank!‚Äù

I laugh.¬† ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait until the enhanced shoot tomorrow with Mona on your lap, especially if we do some nude.‚Äù

Pat‚Äôs eyes get huge.¬† Oh, she hadn‚Äôt thought about it‚Ä¶¬† Mona manages to blush.¬† Her smile is one of a cat that caught an unexpected mouse and she is all for it.

I wonder how Carrot will take all of that‚Ä¶

# Nov 16, 2024: Patricia Rae Wallace

**Human Fae Queen**

Somehow the semi-feral cat is the best behaved creature on this stage with me.¬† What the fuck?¬† Mona is in booty shorts with electrical tape Xs as a demon on my lap smiling at me and the photographer has asked her twice to look at me like a kid looks at Santa and not like a maiden sitting on her true love‚Äôs lap.¬† Pat‚Äôs trying to be chill, but they are all about Grace and this isn‚Äôt the Feb shoot.¬† Lemar is trying to not look at Mona in the D cups and then keeps seeing Jackie or me.¬† I am doing lingerie this first time and I know he‚Äôs never seen me in a swim suit, let alone this Santa red and white thing‚Ä¶ I had my full power when I got out of the cake for that photo shoot.¬† And Jackie‚Äôs in an elf outfit that is best described as GOD DAMN.¬†

Poor guy is so shaken his core isn‚Äôt a calm lake anymore.¬† Jackie is teasing Lemar, showing off the fire thing to Grace who is so impressed she is clapping.¬† Mona‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ what am I gonna do about this demon?

I know we agreed to do risque for this calendar, and most of the employees that aren‚Äôt Fae went with Lingerie, but I, Mona, and Jackie will be doing a few nude in our alt forms for the second set.

‚ÄúMay we have a minute?‚Äù

The photographer nods.¬† I look at the rest.¬† Work mode engaged.¬† ‚ÄúOkay, people, let‚Äôs get this fixed.¬† Pat, love you, STOP STARING AT GRACE.¬† You have the photogenic power of a hell of a cute merfolk.¬† I need that.¬† Smile at the camera, look at the audience.¬† Here.¬† Stare at her right now while I talk.‚Äù

Pat nods and stares at Grace.

‚ÄúGrace, let‚Äôs get this out of the way.¬† Jackie, fire imp please.‚Äù

Jackie becomes fire and I smile.¬† She gets what I am doing.

‚ÄúHere is me in full regalia.‚Äù¬† I embrace everything.¬† Wings pop, crown shines, skin of chrome, and no clothing.¬† *I am magnificent!*¬† Okay, enough of that Devil Pat, you caused enough problems.¬†

Grace stares at me.¬† She‚Äôs seen this before but never when I am just chilling.¬†

‚ÄúMona, drop the bomb.‚Äù She nods and her full demonic appearance somehow gets sexier. She‚Äôs been holding back the appeal and it is noticeable when she stops policing her actions and lets herself move fluidly.

‚ÄúLemar, LOOK AT THE WOMEN!¬† We are nude or in tiny outfits and we are beautiful.¬† Stop thinking it is dirty to look.¬† May cleared this.¬† She was there when I was nude for the cake photoshoot.¬† She told you it was fine.¬† I know Jackie and Mona are both‚Ä¶ a lot.¬† Just look, get the image in your brain and enjoy it.‚Äù

I am interrupted by a hell of a broadcast. *You‚Äôre actually the one wrecking me the most. I‚Äôve always known you are pretty, but damn woman.*

I stop talking and stare at Lemar.

‚ÄúSeriously?! Me?¬† I love you my friend.¬† I will also remind you that you are also wearing just booty shorts and no one knew how well you fill them out.‚Äù¬†

Pat looks up from Grace for a few seconds.¬† ‚ÄúReally was not expecting that and I have to say your core is gorgeous.¬† I‚Äôm jealous of May having your kids for three reasons now.‚Äù

I did not need that one.¬† But it kinda shocked him out of things.¬† He laughs.

‚ÄúEveryone think we can do this?‚Äù

Mona raises her hand.¬† I notice she hasn‚Äôt made a single peep.¬† ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I can look at you any other way, Ms. Wallace.‚Äù

I touch her chin and make her lock eyes with me.¬† ‚ÄúKeep looking at me how you are, he‚Äôs being silly.¬† You are fine.‚Äù¬† I decide to try something.

‚ÄúI actually might be able to fix how you look at me for at least one of the shots, want me to try?¬† Do you trust me?‚Äù

She looks at me with those gorgeous green cat eyes.¬† ‚ÄúImplicitly, Ms. Wallace.¬† I will be anything you want‚Ä¶‚Äù

Oh sweetie‚Ä¶

The photographer comes in, I whisper so only he can hear me.¬† ‚ÄúWhen I am ready I will put my fingers up and you will see my right hand have, 3, then 2, then 1.¬† Take the picture on zero.‚Äù

He nods at me.

I put my 3 fingers up.¬† I embrace my mantle partially and move her a little so she has a puzzled look.¬† Then at two I smile my eyes are full of WitchFyre.¬† She is surprised and at 1 I reach forward and kiss her on the cheek.¬† I lean back and remove the last finger.

Her look of complete shock and adoration is captured in that moment.¬† Perfect.

We get the photos done in no time at all after that.¬† Even did some nudes in there.

I dreamt of the engagement party. The tables are covered in white linen, the crystal glasses clinking as Derek‚Äôs laughter carries across the room. Everyone is radiant, full of pride. Except him.

I remembered it vividly‚Äîeven before I dreamt of it, it was one of those moments seared into me. He pulled me aside when nobody was looking, when Derek was shaking hands with my father.

His voice was low, but sharper than I‚Äôd ever heard it.

**‚ÄúJackie, listen to me. It‚Äôs not just him.‚Äù**

I blinked, confused. *Not just him?*

**‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying Derek is bad. That‚Äôs not what I mean. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs everything that he brings with him. Everything that follows him.‚Äù His voice got low, measured. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Its everything he wants. Everything he‚Äôs willing to sell himself, and you, out for.‚Äù**

I remembered laughing nervously, brushing it off like he was being dramatic. He always had that uncanny way of reading situations too deeply.

**‚ÄúGrandpa, it‚Äôs just an engagement party. Don‚Äôt scare me.‚Äù**

He didn‚Äôt smile. His eyes were glassy, heavy with something unspoken.

**‚ÄúJackie‚Ä¶ there are things you can‚Äôt undo once you‚Äôve said ‚Äòyes.‚Äô You think you know what‚Äôs coming, but you don‚Äôt. Not with him. Not with all of‚Ä¶** ***that***\*\*.‚Äù\*\*

I remembered asking what ‚Äúthat‚Äù meant, but he just squeezed her hand and muttered, almost to himself:

‚ÄúHey babe! Get over here!‚Äù Derek shouted, flashing his brilliant grin across the room, and her grandfather slipped back into the crowd.

The clinking of glasses faded. The lights dimmed. Derek‚Äôs grin stretched impossibly wide. His teeth too sharp, and his voice echoed like it‚Äôs came from inside a cave. My girlfriends‚Äô laughter warped into static. My mother‚Äôs cheer curdled into something like sobbing.

Only my grandfather remained clear. Standing perfectly still while the rest of the room melted into shadows. His eyes meet mine one last time.

I woke up gasping, my throat dry, my body drenched in cold sweat. I heard Derek breathing peacefully beside me, utterly human, utterly normal. I glanced over at my alarm. It was 3am.

I didn‚Äôt go back to bed. I just got up, showered, and got ready for the day.

Later that day around lunch, my fork scraped along the side of my salad bowl as I glanced down the cafeteria. Oswald was sitting alone, tucked away at the very back, huddled over his Tupperware, and now he was reading Plato. His posture was tight, almost defensive, shoulders hunched as if the world itself were too bright.

He finished first, as always, and left without a word.

The moment he left the cafeteria, a hush fell across her table. Then‚Äîlike sharks catching the scent of blood‚Äîthey started.

‚ÄúGod, that guy is so‚Ä¶ weird,‚Äù muttered Elise, stabbing her quinoa like it had personally wronged her.

I tilted my head, surprised at what I just heard. Weird. The way she said it hung harsh and heavy.

‚ÄúRight?‚Äù chimed in Lauren, rolling her eyes. ‚ÄúHe never talks to anyone. Just‚Ä¶ sits there. Eating the same thing every day. It‚Äôs creepy.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, please!‚Äù said Michelle. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt *just* eat the same thing. He *watches* people. I swear to God, I can feel his eyes burning holes in the back of my head sometimes.‚Äù

That set the whole table off‚Äîsnickers, laughter, a chorus of *groans with light chuckling.*

I kept my lips pressed together. I was shocked at the casual pettiness and cruelty being expressed by everyone at the table.

‚ÄúHe gives me the ick,‚Äù Elise continued, tossing her hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúLike, why doesn‚Äôt he just‚Ä¶ go work somewhere else? He clearly doesn‚Äôt fit in.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come on,‚Äù Michelle laughed, ‚Äúthe partners probably keep him around because he‚Äôll do all the boring grunt work without complaining. Every firm needs a‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs the word‚Ä¶ a hermit?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no,‚Äù Lauren grinned, lowering her voice in a mock-whisper, ‚Äúevery firm needs a freak.‚Äù

More laughter.

Jackie pushed a crouton around her plate, saying nothing. The laughter felt brittle, too loud, like it was echoing inside her skull.

¬†

Later, in the women‚Äôs bathroom, the tone was completely different. I was reapplying her lipstick when a cluster of her coworkers swarmed in‚Äîheels clicking, voices carrying like they were on a stage.

‚ÄúJackieee,‚Äù Elise cooed, clasping her hands together. ‚ÄúI still cannot get over how lucky you are. Derek is, like, *dreamboat central.*‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously,‚Äù Lauren agreed, fluffing her hair in the mirror. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like something out of one of those epic romance novels. The hot, successful guy sweeping in and whisking you off your feet? Ugh, I‚Äôm living for it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that engagement party?‚Äù Michelle added, practically swooning. ‚ÄúIt was *perfect.* Like‚Ä¶ Pinterest board perfect. I was telling my mom about it, and she was like, ‚ÄòIs this girl a Kennedy or something?‚Äô‚Äù

They all laughed.

I forced a smile at my reflection.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be the wedding of the year,‚Äù Elise declared, like it was a verdict from on high. ‚ÄúFairytale vibes, Jackie. Absolute fairytale. We‚Äôre all so excited.‚Äù

‚ÄúEpic,‚Äù Lauren said dreamily. ‚ÄúStraight out of a storybook. Prince Charming, glass slipper, the whole thing.‚Äù

My lipstick trembled in my hand.

Marsha‚Äôs office was a glass box glowing with lamplight against the dimming city skyline. I stepped in, clutching my legal pad tighter than I meant to, already bracing myself for the inevitable.

She didn‚Äôt waste time. Partners never do.

‚ÄúJackie, close the door,‚Äù she said, her voice clipped, precise. She was scribbling something across a yellow pad, not even looking at me.

I obeyed.

Finally, she looked up, eyes sharp enough to cut glass. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying past five.‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúTonight?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, tonight. And tomorrow, and probably Friday if you want to keep your hours where they need to be.‚Äù She leaned back, steepling her fingers. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a dozen filings‚Äîmotions for summary judgment, deposition outlines, hearings prep. Half of them are due by *tonight*. Our clients don‚Äôt care that you have dinner plans.‚Äù

Her tone was matter-of-fact, the way only someone who‚Äôs lived inside a white-shoe firm for decades can deliver. She wasn‚Äôt yelling. She didn‚Äôt need to.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúOf course. I‚Äôve been keeping my hours tight. Logged everything‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she interrupted, sharper now. ‚ÄúBecause billables are the only currency that matters here. And Jackie‚Äî‚Äù she tilted her head, just slightly, ‚Äú‚Äîdon‚Äôt make the mistake of thinking you‚Äôre indispensable. You‚Äôre not. The firm is the bloodstream. We all just keep it pumping.‚Äù

It was the kind of line Harvey Specter might drop, casual but loaded. Only coming from Marsha, it didn‚Äôt sound slick. It sounded‚Ä¶ clinical.

I nodded. ‚ÄúI understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúBecause too many young associates think this is law school with a paycheck. It‚Äôs not. We are in the trenches, and if you‚Äôre not willing to bleed hours, someone else will. That‚Äôs the way it works.‚Äù

Her words rattled around in my skull, louder than they should‚Äôve. Normally, I‚Äôd take them, absorb them, keep moving. That‚Äôs what we all did. But this time something was different.

I glanced at the stack of folders on her desk. The same manila files, the same deadlines, the same endless churn. But when she slid one across to me, I noticed something. A faint scrawl on the corner of the cover‚Äîlike a mark, almost carved into the cardboard.

It wasn‚Äôt pen. It wasn‚Äôt pencil. It looked burned.

I froze.

‚ÄúProblem?‚Äù Marsha asked, her eyes narrowing.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said quickly, tucking the file under my arm. But my heart was hammering.

‚ÄúGood. Then get back to work. Don‚Äôt leave before nine.‚Äù She returned to her pad, already finished with me.

I turned and left, the weight of the file dragging my expensive pumps that were a gift from Derek.

In the hallway, the fluorescents flickered once, twice, then held steady. I could hear the hum of the office, the low drone of printers, the faint clack of keyboards from the paralegals still grinding. But something else pressed against me too‚Äîlike the walls themselves were leaning closer, listening.

9pm. Another late night. Another set of hours swallowed into the abyss.

But as I walked back to my desk, I couldn‚Äôt shake the thought pulsing in my head.

What if those files weren‚Äôt just cases? What if that mark I saw wasn‚Äôt an accident?

And what if the basement I wasn‚Äôt supposed to know about‚Ä¶ was where they all ended up?

By the time five o‚Äôclock rolled around, I had already resigned myself to the night. My takeout container was still steaming on the corner of my desk, unopened, while Derek‚Äôs call played on a loop in my head. He‚Äôd canceled dinner‚Äîagain‚Äîthis time with a cheerful excuse: *‚ÄúBig partner stuff, babe. I‚Äôll make it up to you.‚Äù*

Of course he would.

That‚Äôs when I saw Oswald. Heading for the elevators, quiet as always, his file stack tucked neatly under his arm.

‚ÄúYou heading out already?‚Äù I asked, half teasing.

He stopped, looked at me with that calm, oddly detached gaze. ‚ÄúParalegals are required to leave at five.‚Äù His tone wasn‚Äôt apologetic. It was matter-of-fact, like he was quoting some rule carved in stone.

‚ÄúOh. Right.‚Äù I forced a smile. ‚ÄúWell, have a nice night.‚Äù

He gave a little wave, turned, and disappeared into the elevator.

My eyes lingered a little longer than I should‚Äôve‚Äîhis back, broad and impossibly straight, framed against the glow of the closing doors. Then he was gone, and the office swallowed me again.

By the time the sun finally slipped below the horizon, the place had changed. We were all still there‚Äîassociates scattered across different rooms, too chained to our workloads to even think of leaving. Teams chat was our lifeline now, the occasional ping from someone buried three offices away reminding me that I wasn‚Äôt completely alone.

Marsha was still in her glass box, her silhouette lit by the cold glow of her monitor. I could hear the steady tapping of her keyboard whenever I paused long enough to notice.

Then it came.

A dull metallic *thunk.*

The sound drifted from the far side of the floor, toward the dumbwaiter.

I froze, pen in hand.

*Another delivery? At this hour?*

I walked over, footsteps muffled by the carpeted floor thank god, and sure enough‚Äîthere it was. A fresh stack of documents resting in the little metal drawer.

There was a pitch-black folder like before on top. The slip read: **For Marsha Only.**

Of course.

I glanced toward her office. She was slumped over her desk, head tilted slightly, eyes closed. Asleep. I checked my watch: 8:24 p.m.

My chest tightened.

I‚Äôd finished most of my work. I had no reason‚Äî*no excuse*‚Äîto touch what wasn‚Äôt mine. But the weight of those files in the dumbwaiter‚Ä¶ it was like they were humming. Like if I didn‚Äôt open them, they‚Äôd open themselves.

Every instinct I had screamed at me not to do this. It was the kind of feeling that came when you watched a horror movie and were yelling at the girl or the boy not to go down that corner or go through that door because you KNEW something was waiting on the other side.

I moved carefully, angling my body just so, mindful of the black dome of the security camera overhead. One smooth pivot, the file slid open beneath my hands.

And then my blood ran cold.

It was the same as before‚Äîshell companies. Obscure legal entities with bank accounts that traced cleanly, numbers and routing details that checked out on the firm‚Äôs system. Except these weren‚Äôt in places you could fly to. They weren‚Äôt even in places you could point to on a map.

**Coordinates listed in negative dimensions. Time stamps for deposits dated centuries in the future. Withdrawals from eras long past.**

One folder referenced ‚Äúclients domiciled beyond standard jurisdiction of three-dimensional terrestrial space.‚Äù

I felt my stomach drop as my eyes combed further through the documents,

Mixed in with the corporate ledgers were notes‚Äîscrawled memos that didn‚Äôt read like lawyers at all. They spoke of *families*. 

Not metaphorical corporate families, but actual crime families. Mafia names I half-recognized from law school case studies, only‚Ä¶ older. Too old. Names that should‚Äôve died out a centuries ago.

And then the photo.

I wish I hadn‚Äôt seen it.

A glossy print, clipped to the back. A massive shipping crate, the kind you‚Äôd expect to see in a freighter yard. Metal, corroded, bolted shut.

And the size of it‚Äîeasily big enough to hold a car. Or something alive.

I‚Äôd seen that kind of crate before, in movies. *Jurassic Park.* Velociraptors slamming against steel walls.

Only this wasn‚Äôt Hollywood.

There was no studio. No prop team. Just a black-and-white warehouse shot, timestamp blurred like someone didn‚Äôt want me knowing when it was taken.

I shut the file so fast the paper edges sliced my thumb.

A bead of blood welled up instantly, tiny but bright.

Behind me, in the silence of the empty office, the dumbwaiter *clanked* again.

Empty.

Like something had gone back down.

Or was waiting to come up.

I shouldn‚Äôt have checked the dumbwaiter again.  
But when I heard that second *clank*, something in me couldn‚Äôt help it.

This time it wasn‚Äôt a neat stack of manila folders. No, this was heavier, bulkier. A black accordion file, swollen at the seams, wrapped tight with a clasp that looked almost ceremonial. On top of it sat a lockbox‚Äîindustrial gray, edges scuffed with age. The kind of thing you‚Äôd expect to find in a bank vault, not a law firm.

And stamped on the side, faint but undeniable, was a **seal.**  
Raised, wax-like, with a symbol I didn‚Äôt recognize. Geometric lines, concentric circles. The kind of thing that didn‚Äôt belong on legal paperwork. The kind of thing you might find in a secret society textbook or a forgotten church relic.

A wave of dread broke over me. Not the creeping, low-level kind I‚Äôd been battling all week. This was sharp, absolute. My body reacted before my brain caught up‚Äîsweat prickled my scalp, my throat tightened, my hands shook.

I didn‚Äôt dare open it. Not this time. Not with the cameras overhead, not with the weight of that seal staring at me.

So I did the only thing I could think of.

I carefully lifted the entire accordion file and the lockbox, forced my face into a blank, I‚Äôm-just-doing-my-job mask, and walked across the hall to Marsha‚Äôs office. She was still slumped at her desk, mouth slightly open, breathing the shallow rhythm of exhaustion.

I laid the file on her desk, gently, like I was placing a bomb.  
Then I backed away.

Back into view of the cameras. Back into the fluorescent wash of my own cubicle light. Back to the safety of pretending I hadn‚Äôt just brushed up against something I was never meant to see.

It was only 8:07 p.m. I had already completed everything on my docket, but leaving now wasn‚Äôt an option. If anyone asked why I was walking out early, if anyone thought to check where I‚Äôd been a few minutes before‚Ä¶ I couldn‚Äôt risk it.

So I resigned myself to another night. Midnight, at least. 
 
Another missed gym session. Another sacrifice to the altar of Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern.

But what gnawed at me wasn‚Äôt the missed workout.  

It was the thought of the drive home, in my Mercedes, brain fogged with fatigue. I knew how dangerous I got behind the wheel at that hour.

Luckily, the firm provided taxis. For late nights, emergencies, the associates too broken to risk the highway.

By 11:58, I caved. I shut down my computer, grabbed my coat, and pressed the elevator button. The hum of the building changed as I descended. Quieter. Hollow.

The parking garage was almost empty when I stepped out. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in that washed-out, liminal glow that makes the world look more like a memory than reality.

The taxi was already waiting.

I opened the rear door and slid in. Immediately, I noticed it: a partition wall between me and the driver. Not plexiglass like a regular cab, but something harder. Metallic. Cold.

It felt like stepping into an armored convoy.

The driver didn‚Äôt turn, didn‚Äôt greet me. Just one low voice, flat and functional, slipped through a tiny slit in the partition.

‚ÄúDestination?‚Äù

I gave him my address.

He didn‚Äôt reply. Didn‚Äôt acknowledge. The car started rolling forward, smooth and deliberate.

And I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking‚Äî  
Why all the security?

Who exactly was this car designed to protect?

Me?  
Or whoever was making sure I got home *without questions?*

I hit the mattress like a corpse. Didn‚Äôt even change out of my work clothes, didn‚Äôt even brush my teeth. Just collapsed.  

Five hours until the alarm. Five hours until I had to drag my over-caffeinated, underslept body back into that skyscraper, back into billing every last breath, every last swallow of burnt coffee.

And in that moment‚ÄîGod help me‚ÄîI started wishing I‚Äôd flunked out of law school like Oswald.  

At least then I wouldn‚Äôt be *here.*

That‚Äôs when I heard it.

Muffled voices through the door.

Derek.

At first, I tried to ignore it. He took calls late sometimes, and I didn‚Äôt want to know. I was too tired to care. But then‚Äî

‚ÄúYeah, the tranche clears next month‚Ä¶ once it‚Äôs laundered through the offshore feeders.‚Äù

My eyes shot open.

I sat up. Listened harder. The words bled through the thin crack of the door like poison.

‚ÄúNo, Cayman‚Äôs too hot. We‚Äôre cycling this one through the Dutch sandwiches‚Äîshells in the Antilles, then rerouted to the Zurich custodials. After that, it‚Äôs ghosted through Tier-2 intermediaries. By the time Treasury blinks, the paper trail‚Äôs dust.‚Äù

I pressed my bare feet to the carpet and crept toward the door.

Peeking through the peephole, I saw him. Derek. Still in his suit, tie loosened, pacing the hall with his phone to his ear. Calm. Confident.

‚ÄúYeah, I know FATF is tightening, but trust me, they‚Äôll never pierce it. Not with the way Spitzer‚Äôs people structured the trusts. Legitimate on the surface, encrypted underneath. It‚Äôs watertight.‚Äù

*Spitzer‚Äôs people.*  
My blood ran cold.

He chuckled low into the receiver, voice like oil.

‚ÄúExactly. The feds can subpoena Wells all day, it won‚Äôt matter. The books bifurcate‚Äîwhat they see, and what *we* see. Clean as daylight on one side, black as hell on the other.‚Äù

Pause. A shift in his tone.

‚ÄúOf course the Families are satisfied. Why wouldn‚Äôt they be? We‚Äôve doubled their ROI since Q2. And when the Sicilians and the Russians are on the same ledger without killing each other, you don‚Äôt ask questions‚Äîyou just keep the wires humming.‚Äù

The Families? What families?

Then it hit me like a ten ton anvil. My chest tightened.

He stopped pacing, lowered his voice, but I still caught fragments‚Äî

‚ÄúYeah, Delgado‚Äôs firm. They‚Äôve got the infrastructure. Cross-border, multi-jurisdictional filings, everything ironclad. They make it all look *boring as hell,* which is exactly why it works.‚Äù

That was me. My firm, Spitzer, Sullivan and Stern. Marsha‚Äôs work.  

I stumbled back from the door like I‚Äôd been slapped. Derek‚Äôs laugh followed, sharp and satisfied.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. She doesn‚Äôt know. She‚Äôll never know.‚Äù

I barely made it to the bed before I heard the key in the lock. I dove under the covers, heart jackhammering, forcing my breathing into slow, sleepy rhythm.

The door opened. His shoes clicked across the hardwood. The mattress dipped as he sat beside me.

His hand brushed my hair.

‚ÄúLong day, huh?‚Äù he whispered. His voice was honey again. Normal. Safe.

I didn‚Äôt move. Didn‚Äôt answer. Just lay there, pretending to be asleep, every nerve in my body screaming.

Because now I knew.

Derek‚Äôs firm wasn‚Äôt just finance.  
It was a *front.*  

And worse‚Äîsomehow, some way‚Äîit was tied to *my firm too.*

I didn‚Äôt want to move. Didn‚Äôt want to face the day. My body ached from yesterday, from the weight of all of it. But I knew I couldn‚Äôt. Not after everything that happened last night.

I didn‚Äôt shower. Didn‚Äôt change. Just shoved on my heels, tore open the bread, threw some slices in the toaster, grabbed them, and bolted. The subway would have to do today.

The firm‚Äôs cab service called, cheerfully offering the expressway route. I almost said yes‚Äîalmost‚Äîbut then I remembered the last ride. The windows I couldn‚Äôt see through, the driver I couldn‚Äôt see at all. No, the subway was safer. Safer and honest.

By the time I reached the office, Marsha was already there, perched behind her massive desk like a hawk. She didn‚Äôt even look up from her computer when I walked in.

‚ÄúJackie,‚Äù she said, finally, ‚ÄúI need you to start billing for these additional matters immediately. Some depositions, a couple of motions, and the draft for a summary judgment. We need these tonight. So I need you to stay until at least 9.‚Äù

I nodded clenching my jaw. ‚ÄúYes, Marsha.‚Äù

A big, goofy, obedient smile plastered to my face. I even waved my hand a little, the way you do when a client says something absurd but you can‚Äôt actually laugh at it.

Inside though, wanted to rip her head off.

I wanted to scream. I wanted to throw the phone across the room and watch the world explode. I‚Äôve been doing billable hours for **two straight months**, and the workload is relentless. No break, no reprieve. And now she wants more?!

I screamed every curse word in my head, each one more violent than the last. The F-bombs ricocheted in my skull. Every insult, every imaginable threat, hurled at her without a single sound leaving my lips.

But on the outside‚Ä¶

Nothing. Just the friendly, bright, *please-don‚Äôt-hate-me* grin.

‚ÄúYes, Marsha,‚Äù I repeated, soft and cheerful.

Marsha nodded and turned back to her screen. Her presence was like a weight, suffocating but oddly hollow. I wanted lunge over the table and strangle this woman with my bare hands and beat her to a bloody pulp. But I knew I couldn't.

Instead, I sank into my chair, opened ProLaw, and started billing. I could feel every nerve in my body humming with rage.

I hadn‚Äôt slept. Not really. Not since‚Ä¶ God, I couldn‚Äôt even remember last time I had a decent night sleep let alone worked out. Not even a little. Not one run. Not one weight. Hell, not even a walk. Months. Months of sitting at a desk, staring at screens, punching numbers into billable hours, while my body quietly screamed in revolt.

This law job. This *soul-crushing, blood-sucking, daylight-stealing nightmare* they called white shoe law. I‚Äôd have taken an accident on the freeway any day. An eighteen-wheeler smashing into my car wouldn‚Äôt have demanded billable hours. Not the paramedics, not the insurance company, not the fucking IRS. Nothing could be *this cruel* naturally.

And then there was Derek. My fianc√©. The man everyone adored. The golden boy. Charming, flawless, six-foot-three of sheer charisma and charisma alone. Everyone loved him. Everyone. And now I knew why.

He was a goddamn walking front for the Mafia. Every other crime family in the region. And me? I had willingly tied myself to him. Bought the lie, believed in it. Sat in law school, worked my ass off, scored every top grade, all while he *played the golden-boy angel for the world*‚Äîall to fund his rotten deals.

And for what? Why did I even start on this miserable path? Why go to law school at all when starving artists, poets, drifters, didn‚Äôt have to log *every fucking minute* of their existence to a ledger that would ultimately betray them? Why?

And the sorority. My ‚Äúsisters.‚Äù God, I hated that fucking sorority. A glorified hazing cult wrapped in pastel ribbons and weekend retreats. And yet we all bought it. I bought it. And Derek? He didn‚Äôt need to lift a finger. Just smiled that perfect, stupid grin, and they all fell over themselves. Even me. I was stupid enough to be charmed. I had been *played*.

But my parents, sister, and even my friends all fell for his charms, all told me they wish they had what I did. But nobody knew.

And the one person who could have seen this‚Äîmy grandfather‚Äîhe had. Always had. He had seen it all before anyone else did. He had warned me. He had *warned me about the world*, about the kinds of men who wear charm like armor.

About the things they bring with them, the shadows trailing them like smoke. And then he fucking died. Days before I graduated. He didn‚Äôt live to see what came next. And now I was here. Alone.

But then I stumbled onto something deadly serious. Something that made my chest tighten, my stomach knot, my mind spiral. I knew too much. I had seen the shell corporations that didn‚Äôt exist in any dimension, the bank accounts that weren‚Äôt on any ledger yet traced to real-world banks, the crates, the photos, the files that smelled of something old, corrupt, *primordial*.

And I knew. I couldn‚Äôt leave. Not now. Not ever. Not while all this was moving like a slow, inevitable tide around me.

Because if I left‚Ä¶ if I walked away‚Ä¶ I would vanish. Just like those accounts. Just like those files. 

And suddenly I realized: this wasn‚Äôt a game. This wasn‚Äôt a law firm. It wasn‚Äôt a job, not even Derek. This was something far, far worse. And I was in it. Whether I liked it or not.

I suspected that between that crate I saw and the offshore files, even the Mafia was in over their heads.

I clenched my fists. My teeth. My heart pounded so loud I was sure Marsha in the office down the hall could hear it.

I wasn‚Äôt leaving. I couldn‚Äôt.

Because the moment I did‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt just lose my job. I wouldn‚Äôt just lose Derek, or my sanity, or my life as I knew it. I‚Äôd vanish. 

And that‚Ä¶ that was not an option.

I was halfway through another billing spreadsheet when my phone buzzed. *Marsha*.

‚ÄúJackie,‚Äù she said, her tone syrupy, ‚Äúcould you come to the conference room? The partners want to see you.‚Äù

My stomach dropped. My pulse quickened. The day had been dragging for hours, my mind looping over every shell corporation, every impossible account, every crate photograph. I‚Äôd been thinking about leaving. *Walking out*. Slamming the elevator doors on this tower of lies and not looking back.

I wanted out.

I wanted to run.

And then I walked into the conference room.

Three managing partners were there, sitting like statues at the long, polished mahogany table. Their smiles were too sharp, too deliberate, too rehearsed. Marsha stood aside, hands folded, a silent sentinel.

‚ÄúJackie,‚Äù the first partner said, voice smooth, almost velvet. ‚ÄúWe wanted to congratulate you. Truly. Your performance these past few months has been exemplary.‚Äù

I nodded, my throat tight. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot just that,‚Äù the second partner said, leaning back, hands steepled. ‚ÄúWe hear you‚Äôre engaged. That wedding is coming up soon, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúYes. Next month.‚Äù

A slow smirk spread across the third partner‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúA happy occasion. Your fianc√© must be very proud.‚Äù

I forced a polite smile. ‚ÄúHe is.‚Äù

There was a pause. And then they leaned forward slightly, almost imperceptibly. Their words didn‚Äôt need to carry a threat. Their eyes did the work.

‚ÄúFor the sake of your family,‚Äù the first partner said casually, ‚Äúand, of course, your fianc√©‚Ä¶ it would be prudent not to leave Spitzer, Sullivan & Stern. Your continued presence here is‚Ä¶ beneficial.‚Äù

The words were soft, almost polite. But they weren‚Äôt an invitation. They were a warning.

I could feel my pulse in my temples, my hands tightening into fists I forced to rest in my lap. I wanted to scream, to demand answers, to rip the veneer off this polished hellhole and see the rot underneath.

Instead, I nodded again. ‚ÄúOf course. I understand.‚Äù

Marsha gave me a small, approving nod, almost imperceptible. I could hear the faint click of the door as it closed behind me, sealing me in the silent corridor.

And I realized something chilling.

They didn‚Äôt have to say it. They didn‚Äôt need to spell out what would happen if I left.

1nwxq76,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1nwxq76/need_help_in_choosing_an_electric_grinder_for/,Need help in choosing an electric grinder for Espresso and Latte.,"Hi All,

I have been using Mokapot for many years with pre-ground coffee. I drink Black Coffee / Americano before the gym and mostly milk-based coffee during the day.  
  
Recently bought a Delonghi Dedica Duo ec890 from Amazon Sale. Learning some basic latte art as well.   
I also got a bottomless portafilter with a non-pressurised basket for the same. 

I tried pre-ground coffee from Starbucks and Third Wave, and had specifically asked them to grind it very fine for the espresso machine. Still, the flow is way too fast even on the stock pressurised basket. 

After a lot of research, I figured that pre-ground coffee will not work on an espresso machine like I want it to. Hence, I decided to get an electric grinder.

Shortlist:  
**1. DF54** \- 26k (Out of my budget, but can still stretch till here if it's really better than the other two options)  
**2. Bartza Encore ESP** \- 19.5k  
**3. Hibrew G5** \- 18k (Currently out of stock)

I am leaning towards Bartza and DF54.   
I read a few posts that say both HiBrew G5 and DF54 are white label products from China, and these companies don't really design them. They just put their brand label and sell it. That said, I don't mind if it's white label, if the after-sales support and quality are good.

  
Where to buy from? Since all of these grinders are imported, after-sales support is by the retailer only.  
**Brewing Gadgets** \- They have an outlet here in Bangalore and solid reviews on Google (They have Bartza)  
**Fix Coffee** \- People seem to like their service. They don't have a shop here in Bangalore (They have DF54 & Hibrew G5)

Which one should I go for? Will really appreciate your help.

At this time, thoughts come to me that seem to be born after hours of gloomy overthinking, not the first things you think of upon waking. I have no control over these thoughts; it feels like they start not even at the moment of awakening, but a little earlier, when I'm on the border between sleep and reality.

It made her insomnia feel less claustrophobic. The shining light was always there to keep her company no matter how late, or early it was in this case. Astrid hiked her way the ice shelf she had the honor of studying. The packed frozen liquid became her refuge at the bottom of the Earth.

She looked behind her back at the research base to make sure no one was following her. The only thing Astrid saw was the quiet metallic structure half a mile away. Astrid was satisfied the base was still silent at this early hour. She didn‚Äôt want her coworkers to see what she would do next. Leaving the environment the way she found it was core tenet in Antarctica. The ritual of hers would leave behind her imprint.

Coffee was the lifeblood on the basis. Even one wasted drop was a dishonor to beautifully caffeinated energy. Not to mention it was low in supply. The base was due for a supply ship in a few days and hopefully it would come packed with Caf√© Bustelo Instant Coffee. Astrid would have to do this fast. She set the thermos firmly in her crossed legs on the packed snow and flipped open the lid. Yellow hair escaped from Astrid‚Äôs braid as she went to take a sip from her thermos. Not wanting to release the warmth in her hands, she tried to toss her hair back with a shake of her head but only exceeded in causing more loose hair to fall out.

She had made her decision and gripped her right hand with her left. With one deep breath in preparation, she ripped off the insulated glove from her skin. The cold bit her exposed skin as soon as the fabric was removed. Like the icy windswept air had left something unclaimed to the warmth and demanded it back. Astrid quickly shuffled her hair behind her ear mitts without removing them from her ears. Those small pieces of skin wouldn‚Äôt last out here. It had only been seconds and the exposed hand had already begun to cramp.

Astrid shoved her hand back deep in the glove and cradled her it close to her chest. She rocked back and forth hoping the kinetic energy of her movements would warm her up. ¬†It wasn‚Äôt as cold as it could be in Antarctica this time of year. Today was lukewarm compared to the frigid winter nights. Down here, lukewarm meant a few degrees Fahrenheit.

The pain ebbed in her hand. Astrid reached for her thermos and groaned in dismay. The lid was still open. The dark liquid had begun to crystallize. Little patterns of ice forming on the top layer.¬† The permanent frown on her face from years of intense concentration on her dissertation grew larger. ¬†She chided herself much louder than she would if surrounded by people.

Astrid rose from her spot. Her bones cracked in the familiar way after sitting on the ground for an extended amount of time. The youthful bounce back of her skeleton eroded faster every day in this freezing climate. Aging didn‚Äôt help either. She had spent too much of her time in her twenties, living a life of little importance. After college she was lost in a world of her own making. Astrid willed herself to get rid of the memories, but it never worked. Each memory had burrowed itself into her brain. ¬†

It wasn‚Äôt until her thirtieth birthday, when everything in her life seemed to turn the tide due to the dedication of a few select people, Astrid was able to graduate with her Masters in geology and enrolled in a PhD program for glaciology. She since had been working on her dissertation. This expedition was her last shot at putting academic weight behind her name. Each other mission resulting in unreliable data. Maybe then she would finally feel accomplished after years of nothing.

The walk back to the base was silent except for the crunch echoing beneath her feet. As she went down the hill made of ice, Astrid could see the harbor come into view. There sat this week‚Äôs cruise ship and it‚Äôs still sleeping occupants. Astrid would lead an excursion back to this hill. It presented itself as a mound cut in half overlooking the see but it was really an iceshelf. Part of Astrid‚Äôs grant dictated she would lead the tourists on these trips on the continent to generate revenue.

Astrid would rather research and have conversations with herself than speak with strangers. Even if it was about her favorite topic. Thankfully, the master‚Äôs student on her grant would be there as a buffer. Mae acted as Astrid counterpart, an energetic researcher who loved to talk and seemed excited about everything. Astrid would be able to take a backseat as long as Mae was able to convey the appropriate information with accuracy. Mae always did.

Astrid reached the outer door and allowed the Face ID to scan her and unlock the door. Once that door was open, there stoop one more door, designed to keep the winter weather out from the base during the coldest season. She turned the wheel on the door that moved it on its tracks. Her gloved hands almost slipped but she managed to keep her grip and continue to turn.

She entered the front room where the scientists would store therir winter gear. There A ¬†wooden table with matching benches off to the side, tucked in the corner. Most people avoided this room unless they were leaving or coming. Astrid found this space more appealing than the others. Here she was closest to the outside. She felt free knowing she could come and go as she pleased without anyone asking her questions.

The snowsuit peeled of Astrid body which was covered in a thin sheen of sweat. The snowsuit did its job and kept the warmth in Astrids body. Once disrobed and standing in her causal clothes, she made her way to the mess hall where hopefully breakfast and a hot cup of coffee were waiting for her. The hallway was lined with painted concrete. She made a left at the end of the hallway and threw open the wooden double doors. Behind the doors, the smell of cured bacon and pancakes filled her nose.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I've been working from home lately, and like many of you, I've struggled with keeping my coffee hot while juggling work tasks. After trying various solutions, I finally found the perfect mug warmer that doesn't take up too much space on my cramped desk.

I know the frustration of reaching for your coffee only to find it cold ‚Äì especially during those long Zoom meetings. After extensive research and testing different products, I discovered this amazing compact mug warmer that's been a game-changer for my daily routine: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

What I love most about this particular model is its minimal footprint. At just 4.3 inches in diameter, it fits perfectly even on my small corner desk without interfering with my mouse pad or keyboard. The sleek design doesn't look bulky or out of place among my other desk accessories.

Here's what really sets it apart:
- Temperature control options
- Auto shut-off feature (safety first!)
- Compatible with most standard mugs
- Non-slip base
- Waterproof surface

I've tried those oversized warmers before, and they were just impractical for small spaces. Some of them were so big they practically needed their own desk! But this one hits the sweet spot between functionality and size.

For those wondering about power consumption ‚Äì it's surprisingly efficient. I keep mine plugged in all day, and it barely affects my electricity bill. The heating element maintains a consistent temperature without overheating your beverage, which is crucial for both taste and safety.

Pro tip: If you're considering getting one (which I highly recommend), make sure your favorite mug has a flat bottom for optimal heat transfer. I learned this the hard way with my curved-bottom mug!

I've actually gotten so much use out of mine that I bought another one for my partner. If you're interested in checking it out, here's the link again: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer

I honestly can't imagine my workspace without it now. It's perfect for anyone with limited desk space who still wants to enjoy hot beverages throughout the day. Whether you're a coffee enthusiast, tea lover, or hot chocolate fan, this compact warmer is a total desk essential.

Let me know if you have any questions about size specifications or compatibility with different mug types. I'd be happy to help based on my experience!",1,1759493873.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

I'm in mid 30s, but people see my that I'm in my late 20s. So, would like to share my routine for skincare routine with you. When it comes to skincare, I really believe the basics matter the most: Sleep well and eat healthy food ‚Üí your skin always reflects your lifestyle. Then comes skincare products. They‚Äôre important, but they work best¬†*on top of*¬†good habits.

That said, I‚Äôve tried a lot of products and thought I‚Äôd share my quick ratings + impressions:

1. **Banobagi Ampoule (6/10)**¬†Hydrating, decent moisture, but not super impressive. I‚Äôd personally move on to something else.
2. **Mediheal Hyaluronic Mask (8/10)**¬†Affordable and surprisingly nice. After using it, my makeup looked more glowy. Mediheal has variety of different types of masks, but not sure about the ‚Äúanti-aging‚Äù claims ‚Äî feels more like a hydration boost.
3. **Innisfree Retinol PDRN Ampoule (9/10)**¬†My skin usually hates retinol ‚Äî always breaks out, even with tiny amounts. But this one? No irritation at all. It uses a vegan PDRN derived from green tea, which seems to cushion the irritation. Skin felt smoother the next morning. Price is reasonable too.
4. **d‚ÄôAlba Tone-up Sunscreen (9/10)**¬†Sunscreen = absolute must. This one brightens with a pink base but doesn‚Äôt leave a chalky white cast. Doubles as a makeup base, so on no-makeup days I skip foundation and just use this. Texture is really comfortable.
5. **Dr.G Moisture Cream (9/10)**¬†Very well-known as a calming moisturizer. Daily use with zero breakouts, affordable, and simply reliable. (Funny enough, I don‚Äôt love their sunscreen ‚Äî stings my eyes ‚Äî but the cream is excellent.)
6. **Not a product, but a tip**¬†‚Üí Gua sha before bed. I gently massage along my neck, jawline, and behind my ears. It boosts circulation and makes my face look healthier in the morning.
7. **And of course: water!**¬†Coffee doesn‚Äôt count! I used to drink only coffee/cola all day. Recently I cut coffee for a week and focused on water ‚Äî the inner hydration feels¬†*so different*. Not exaggerating, it really shows on my skin.

I am actually sick but I could work through it, I would just be very uncomfortable. 

So on Monday the company wide owner of our function emailed my skip boss and said he wanted an accounting of all our broken inventory as well as a projection of what won't sell and what site should own the charges by the end of today.  It's a huge undertaking, very political, and cross-functional. 

So I immediately set up a 10 minute meeting with my boss and skip boss to discuss the request. They declined. I messaged my skip boss for some times he could meet. He left me on read despite showing available. That afternoon after already losing half a day on a request that usually takes an entire month to prepare I sent an email to the stake holders suggesting a narrower than normal focus and asking their thoughts. Nobody fucking responded. 

I went ahead with some work on my own but it's pretty minimal compared to what it should be given who asked for it. I finally got skip boss on slack and he said he was too busy all week to meet until Friday. Then yesterday I went out and saw he was fucking grilling hot dogs at the fall employee festival. Too busy to meet? Are you serious!? 

This morning it feels like a football is in my lower intestine and I'd like to just lounge and drink water. I'm dehydrated from work, too much coffee not enough water and not enough breaks. I don't want to deal with this massive problem that my bosses incompetence caused. 

Edit: Some grammar and this is a 10s of millions and easily 10-20% budget line item request coming from my bosses bosses bosses bosses boss. It should not have been ignored by my site leadership and left last minute. I decided to call in. Their lack of planning and engagement is not my emergency and I don't feel well. They will have to deal with the report on their own.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
