1q6ghwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/BingeEatingDisorder/comments/1q6ghwn/vyvanse_and_bed/,Vyvanse and BED,"Hoping I can help shed some light on Vyvanse and its effects on binge eating disorder as I have noticed it's a hot topic at the moment, but has so many contradictory and confusing reveiws- 

Before starting Vyvanse, I spent countless hours reading reviews. Some people said it changed their lives, others said it made things worse, and many said it worked at first and then stopped. This was incredibly stressful because I felt desperate for something—anything—to help my bingeing. I’ve now been on Vyvanse for just over a month, and this has been my experience.

For some background: I struggled with severe juvenile anorexia and spent most of my teens in a kind of pseudo-recovery. When I met my boyfriend, I genuinely committed to recovery. I was told the “right” way to recover was to eat absolutely anything I wanted, whenever and however much I wanted.

So I did. For months. Jars of peanut butter, family-sized chocolate bars, entire loaves of bread, tubs of butter. I was told this was normal and that my body would eventually trust me. A year passed, I gained a lot of weight, and nothing changed. Two years in, I was still eating the same way—except now I had extremely high cholesterol, something I’d never had before.

Because of my AN history, my mum and doctors were terrified of triggering a relapse, and I was repeatedly told that someone with a past of anorexia couldn’t develop BED. Maybe I’m the exception, but I’ve been consumed by binge eating for over a year. My weight kept increasing, my health worsened, and my mental health declined to the point where I genuinely believed this was just my life now.

Last month, I finally told my GP and psychiatrist what I’d been hiding out of shame. Along with bingeing, I also struggle with intense anxiety, time obsession, rigid habits, and poor organisation. Although I’ve never been formally diagnosed with ADHD, I have many overlapping symptoms. Given that Vyvanse is approved for BED, it was suggested and prescribed.

If you’ve read negative reviews or stories about increased bingeing, please don’t let that stop you from considering it. It’s not a miracle cure—but it has helped me more than I ever expected.

The biggest change, and the reason my life feels somewhat normal for the first time, is that it has dramatically reduced food noise. I don’t wake up thinking about food. I don’t go to bed planning binges. I’m not constantly mentally preoccupied

For those of you who are still reading this insanely long post 😂 if you do give it a chance, here are a few things I’ve learned along the way:

You may lose your appetite, but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t eat. I make sure I eat three meals a day regardless of hunger cues — this prevents shakiness, weakness, and helps my body feel safe. When the meds wear off, I do notice a spike in hunger and cravings. To manage this, I take my dose slightly later in the morning (it no longer affects my sleep), so the comedown happens after dinner and my evening snack, which helps prevent binge urges.

I can’t really drink coffee anymore — if I do, it has to be in the morning with food. Otherwise I get very shaky, so I’ve switched to decaf.

I also don’t feel thirst as strongly. I got quite dehydrated in the first week, which definitely worsened my anxiety and fatigue, so now I consciously monitor my fluid intake and make sure I’m drinking enough.

If I don’t have structure or plans for the day, I can spiral into negative thoughts. Vyvanse really thrives on productivity, so having tasks and staying busy makes a big difference for my mental state.

If I miss a dose (I’ve done this twice), I’m completely exhausted and my binge urges return. That’s been a clear reminder of how much it helps when I take it consistently.

It’s also made me much more talkative 😅 great socially, but my roommate has definitely noticed. I’m learning to sit with my thoughts instead of saying every single one out loud.

Do not mix it with alcohol — if you’re drinking, skip the dose. I felt sick and weak, and my anxiety the next day was awful.

Lastly, I really recommend going into Vyvanse with zero expectations. I obsessed at first over what I was “supposed” to feel and whether it was “working,” which only made my anxiety worse. What I’ve realised is that my life feels largely the same — except that, without even trying, my binge urges and frequency have almost disappeared. Don’t wait for a dramatic feeling or moment. Just live as normally as you can

i had two exes before, one year and two year relationships. both were terrible people and when we broke up i hated them, so it was actually easier to move on. but this guy is one of the best people i know, he gave me a sense of warmth i never knew. i replay our memories in my mind constantly, how he held my hand just the day before the break up, how he kissed me... i was finally in a relationship where i was not afraid of my partner. i cried my eyes out because i did not want him to find someone else, i just wanted to be with him. i miss him terribly. i wish i could hate him, but i cant. 

so, for college break i came to my family's house and have no social life here (very small town, all of my friends are away). i lay in bed and do nothing, haven't eaten in three days, i have t1d and have been neglecting my blood sugars, i just drink coffee and smoke. i stopped smoking regularly months ago, but now i smoke everyday and smoke more than i used to. it feels like this is the only thing that i am able to do. only accomplishment i can get is finishing a cigarette. i cannot move my body out of my bed.

i do not know how things got to this point, i recently got interviewed for an internship in a global brand, my grades were good, i was doing better. i am currently on medication too, i do not understand how it got this bad.

i have tons of things to do, i should learn sql for example. but no motivation. none. every time i am not talking to someone, i feel tears rushing to my eyes, remembering him.

i should and have to get out of this situation. i just do not know how, i cannot bear it. my heart feels heavy. there is no gym i can go to and the weather is freezing, cannot go outside. i crochet and read, my main hobby are those, well i cannot read as i used to but you get it. i do not know how to start a day, my days feels like spirals. i know things will get better, but i cannot stay like this any longer. i simply cannot take it.

so, what can i do? i cannot shake the feeling that i am unlovable and everything i do is meaningless. every relationship ends the same, my partner decides that they do not love me. the end.

 i want to be healthy, i want to do things.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

On Sunday morning I woke up and the house was far too quiet, which is never a good sign when you’ve got two boys (8 and 11). The last time this happened they tried to make a mosaic cake, swapped the biscuits for cereal, and managed to get cocoa powder absolutely everywhere. And I mean *everywhere*.

Anyway, I went downstairs and found them playing on their new digital tabletop game they have, and they were playing very nicely. We said good morning to each other and I went straight into the kitchen to make coffee and sort breakfast.

I’d been in there about 15 minutes when my partner came in and first thing he said was “hang on, is that screen time?” That then turned into a fairly quiet argument, because the boys aren’t allowed screens before breakfast, and me not saying anything meant he’d have to be the bad guy and suddenly take the board away, even though I’d been aware of it for several minutes and hadn’t said a word.

We’ve always been pretty clear in our house that video games count as screen time, as does TV and iPad time.

Our reasoning around limiting screens is mostly about avoiding dopamine addiction and encouraging the boys to be present in the world around them. We live in the UK and screen addiction feels like a massive issue here, you see how much kids have changed. Some can’t even sit through a meal without tiktok or youtube shorts playing. We’re trying to be very intentional about the kind of input our kids’ brains are getting, if that makes sense. So for my partner, it felt a bit like a betrayal that I’d let them use their digital board first thing in the morning.

My argument was that this feels much more like a board game- lots of reading, thinking, negotiating, etc. My partner still feels that a screen is a screen. I kept saying it seems closer to a traditional board game that just happens to light up. It’s significantly lower-dopamine than video games and much easier on the eyes. Honestly, that morning was so pleasant, and I want him to see what I see and let them use the board in the mornings but I’m also wondering whether I’m in the wrong here, as we agree on so much and I’ve come to trust his judgement on things.

1q6g5dx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheHermesGame/comments/1q6g5dx/nye_paris_score/,NYE Paris Score,"**TL;DR:** Purchased a Kelly 32 in gold with gold hardware as a walk-in on New Year’s Eve in Paris (Sèvres).

**Longer version with history:**

I began purchasing Hermès about 3.5 years ago in Paris, starting with gold Orans. I have mainly limited my purchases to trips to France due to the price savings. Over the years, I’ve purchased a couple of scarves, two bracelets, and a pair of men’s shoes for my husband.

About 2.5 years ago, I purchased a Herbag as a walk-in at Sèvres. My husband asked for the appointment in French and specifically requested a Herbag, and they were very helpful in offering one on the spot. Later that day, I received an email confirming a leather appointment for the next day at George V. At that appointment, the SA mentioned that she saw I had received a bag the day before and only offered me a Garden Party. I politely declined, and she seemed to appreciate this. She even suggested that I could try visiting another Paris store and mention that I had an appointment but that no bags were available for me.

Last Christmas, we were in Lille, where I walked in to purchase a scarf and asked about a Mini Evelyne. I was again polite and explained that I understood bags were usually reserved for locals, but that I had received an appointment in Paris the year before and no bags were available. She went to get approval and was able to sell me a Mini Evelyne, which I was thrilled about.

We visit Paris one to two times a year and always apply for a leather appointment. When we walk into a store, I usually ask for a non-quota bag, as I know most people are asking for a Birkin or Kelly.

This year, my husband and I applied for an appointment, but I had trouble confirming the request on my phone. The following day, New Year’s Eve, we went to the Sèvres store, which is my favorite in Paris. It carries more product than George V but is less hectic than FSH. My husband again asked if any leather appointments were available or if they had a Kelly To Go, hoping for a non-quota option.

The host asked whether we had applied online, and my husband explained that we had, but that I had experienced issues confirming the request. She asked for both of our passports and verified that we were visiting from the U.S. She then told us that a leather appointment was available with a 30-minute wait. Since we were with our toddler, she suggested we wait at the café and return afterward.

We happily went upstairs for coffee, and as soon as our drinks arrived, she returned with an SA and said they were available early. My husband stayed with our toddler while I went downstairs for the appointment.

The SA was very friendly and direct, asking what I was looking for. I explained that I already owned a Herbag and a Mini Evelyne, both of which I loved, and that my dream bag was a larger Kelly. I also mentioned that I was interested in a Kelly To Go. He asked about color preferences and hardware. I told him that gold hardware was the most important factor for me, and that I liked both colors and neutrals—especially greens and creams. When he asked whether I preferred dark or bright greens, I said brighter shades. I also mentioned that I would be interested in a gold-on-gold option for a larger Kelly.

He asked if I had a third bag preference, and I said I did not—I was only interested in a larger Kelly or a Kelly To Go. I also made it clear that I was not interested in a Mini Kelly, which seemed to be well received.

He went to check availability and was gone for quite some time—much longer than the SA who had previously offered me the Garden Party. When he returned, he told me he had something for me to see. He brought me into a private room and presented a Kelly 32 in gold with gold hardware. I was thrilled and accepted immediately. The remainder of the purchase proceeded very quickly.

  
I believe several factors helped contribute to both securing the appointment and the purchase. My husband’s ability to ask in French, along with the fact that I was there with him and our toddler, likely worked in our favor. ",8,1767794546.0,TheHermesGame,3,1.0,False

1q6g3wk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q6g3wk,"Olivia Dean, Wanton Sex drives, Pancit and post-Christmas realizations.","***LONG POST. Be warned.***

***“Are you having a second childhood this early?”*** asked my friend Tonette as she slid into my car and immediately observed Olivia Dean was playing.

It was such a loaded question, coming from Tonette, whose very name sounds like the alias of a nightclub diva who insists on being called *“Miss Tonette”* and whose aura is permanently bading, even on days she’s trying to look like a respectable tita.

I wanted to rebut and tell her that her name is so bading and she looks bading just the same. But I was too tired to bitch, which is the closest I’ve come to spiritual growth this holiday season. The traffic, the rush, the crowds, the feeling that Metro Manila exists mainly to test your patience and your suspension system.

So instead I said, in the tone of a person trying to be mature:

***“I also have Dua Lipa if you want?”***

Tonette reacted like I suggested an actual road trip to Batangas.

***“Ay anong gagawin naten sa Lipa? Ang layo!”***

Your name is Tonette, you look bading, and you are stupid at times. My best friend, peeps.

And I think that’s what adulthood really is. Realizing everyone around you is stuck in some version of childhood, including yourself, and learning to love them anyway.

Because the second childhood isn’t just about music.

It’s also about the way you commit to someone who appears to have checked all the boxes you want in a relationship, except sometimes his libido behaves like a college freshman discovering motel rooms for the first time.

Take for example: right after a quick grocery run, he asked that we have sex right there in the parking lot.

Parking lot. In broad daylight. Next to other people’s vehicles. Beside shopping carts. Like we were auditioning for a reality show called *“Mga Walang Delikadesa.”*

I told him, in the tone of a person trying to remind himself he’s no longer invincible: ***“Dude, we are no longer in our twenties to do that.”***

I had to remind him of that incident many many years ago, when we were caught naked inside the car by a roving security guard at Festival Mall. Yes, Festival Mall. A wholesome family destination where couples go to watch movies, eat churros, and apparently, where we once contributed to someone’s lifelong trauma.

We were stupid then. 

Still stupid now, but with better skincare and worse knees.

Realizing that it could happen again, he offered that we shag in a motel. Hotel Ava, formerly known as Victoria Court. The rebrand is supposed to make it sound classy, like an upscale boutique hotel, but let’s be honest: we all know what we go there for.

In my mind, I was already questioning the sudden burst of kink and fetish, especially when he mentioned about having sex in a room full of mirrors, when we can do it in my unit and it’s free. I mean, free should already be sexy.

But then I realized: maybe he isn’t just horny. **Maybe he’s nostalgic?**

Maybe he’s remembering those sneaky afternoon motel trysts during vacant hours in college, or the thrill of getting caught, or the feeling that we were young and reckless and our biggest problem was hiding bite marks under our uniform.

Maybe he too is having second childhood episodes.1

And maybe, instead of judging him, I should thread carefully and understand that people have peculiarities and repetitive needs despite age. We don’t outgrow desire. We just outgrow flexibility.

Which brings me to the province.

I went to visit my house in Zambales, an inheritance from my parents, and I have to admit: provincial life is starting to rub off on me. It’s quieter, slower, and you begin to notice how much of city life is fueled by constant wanting.

Metro Manila affords us necessities, yes. But it also heightens our senses to crave things frequently.

***“You need to have this.”***  
***“It’s on sale. Buy it.”***  
***“There’s a new bar, let’s go.”***

In the province, from where I stand, I hear none of that. I hear only the birds chirping and the coffee maker starting to drip. There is no pressure to be interesting. No noise telling you to buy your way into happiness. You just exist. And sometimes that’s comforting.

Sometimes it’s also terrifying.

***“I can drop dead here and no one will notice,”*** I told myself, staring at the quiet.

It wasn’t even drama. My neighbor, a US Army retiree, was found dead. Had it not stunk, no one would know. That’s the thing about quiet places. They can feel like healing until you realize they can also swallow you whole.

So when I think about relocating here, I want to acclimate and try, but then the fear of living alone in a rustic barrio haunts me. I’m not scared of silence. I’m scared of being forgotten in it. But the province also has its own reminders that life is life, and kabaklaan is kabaklaan.

The only thing that reminded me of the city that night was when I saw two men in a compromising position across the vacant lot beside the mango tree, which is also my property.

And I was like, ***“Puta, me bakla pa din pala dito.”***

That was the universe telling me: don’t worry, girl. Even in Zambales, people will still find ways to be messy.

Speaking of messy, Christmas.

I decided to give my friends uniform gifts this year. Fuck the digestive cookies from Marks and Spencer. Instead, I paid my cousin to bake oatmeal cookies and have them boxed, paired with bags of UCC coffee bought at a Lazada sale. No gift wraps. Just a red ribbon to secure everything like it was merch from a corporate event.

My cousin was happy with the side income. I was liberated from wrapping. And my friends now have elevated sugar levels and GERD thanks to the coffee and cookie combo.

This is friendship. This is love. This is biochemical warfare.

As for gifts I received, I got a lot this year, which is another story. But the Crocs from the family exchange gift really hit the spot. I got two pairs and I was genuinely happy, which is a little embarrassing because imagine being emotionally moved by footwear, but here we are.

Thanks to my mom, she asked everyone to give meaningful gifts we can actually use. Like, get to know what your sibling really needs. In my case, when they learned I bought fake Crocs in Divisoria, they decided to gift me the legit thing.

This is what adulthood is too. People finally giving you something practical. Not because they’re boring, but because they accept that your life is now mostly errands and plantar fasciitis.

***“Kayo peeps, were you satisfied with the gifts you received?”***

Maiba naman.

Between spaghetti and pancit, I gravitate more to pancit. I admit I have an eternal obsession with pancit and monay with ice cold Coke. Ewan ko ba. It’s been like that for me forever.

In Makati, there are Aristo carts all over Salcedo, and if I ever pass by and see a large vat of steaming pancit, bihon, canton, palabok, 100 percent I will buy.

Steaming pancit is my weakness. It is my love language. It is my toxic trait.

And maybe that’s the real second childhood.

Not the playlist. Not the parking lot sex suggestions. Not even Tonette’s eternal stupidity.

It’s the way we keep returning to the same things that comfort us, the same flavors, the same chaos, the same people, the same old cravings, even when we’re older, tired, and pretending we’ve grown up.

Second childhood isn’t about acting young.

It’s about realizing you never really stopped.",1,1767794452.0,adultingph,0,1.0,False

This is documentation, not advice. I do not share daily logs, exact dosages, or prescriptive guidance — only structure, principles, and observed outcomes.

Weight development across both phases is summarized visually in the attached figure further down in the post.



**\*\*\* This post is a general documentation \*\*\***  
**Diary and exact doses/plans not shared - only structure and principles**  
This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 1 - Weight reduction phase**

Total energy intake below 500 kcal/day over 10 weeks - equivalent to less than 40% of the body's basal needs (Based on a combination of eating days of 400–700 kcal and fasting periods of 48–72 hours.)

**1.0. Context and clarification**

This document describes an extreme, medically inspired weight loss regimen designed to test the limits of physiological fat burning in a healthy adult male. The protocol combines deep ketosis, scheduled fasting intervals and extreme calorie restriction. It is carried out with occasional medical supervision and documented as an experimental case, not as a recommended method.

The regimen corresponds to what is referred to in professional circles as therapeutic ketosis with fasting or extremely calorie restrictive ketosis - methods used clinically in epilepsy, severe obesity and metabolic dysfunction. It is in practice a combination of OMAD (One Meal A Day) and 48–72 hour fasting periods in deep ketosis. In more technical language it is called a medical fasting protocol with ketogenic meals.

In this project, OMAD is implemented as one meal a day consumed in less than 30 minutes, not an open eating window. On fasting days, omega-3 and collagen are omitted to achieve complete fasting and maximum autophagy.

More brutally expressed, this is a “hard ketosis with fasting days and zero exceptions” – a pure fat burning protocol, not a lifestyle fad. In short: 100% metabolic control – no food, no compromise.

**1.1. Preparation and setup**

The aim was to investigate how far fat burning and metabolic control can be driven without medication or exercise, but within a safe physiological framework.

Starting point: 51 years / 181 cm / 92 kg.

The protocol was based on long-term experience with OMAD through shift work, and included planned fasting periods of 48–72 hours, strictly controlled electrolyte intake, and full daily micronutrient coverage.

**1.2. Permitted foods and supplements**

\- Protein sources  
Skinless chicken fillet, turkey fillet, white fish (cod, pollack, haddock, saithe), shrimp, crab, mussels, egg whites, tuna in water (limited to 3–4 cans per week).

\- Vegetables  
Non-starchy only: broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage types, Brussels sprouts, spinach, squash, cucumber, mushrooms, celery, spring onions, leeks, chilies, garlic, lettuce types, green peppers, fennel, asparagus, green beans, seaweed/algae.

\- Seasoning  
Salt, pepper, sugar-free spices, vinegar, lemon/lime, soy sauce (reduced salt), unsweetened mustard, herbs, sugar-free broth.

\- Drinks  
Water (carbonated or non-carbonated), black coffee, unsweetened herbal tea, water with salt.

\- Supplements (categories without doses)  
Multivitamin, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, omega-3, sodium/potassium, salt.  
All supplements were taken daily, including during fasting periods (not collagen or omega-3). Collagen (only on eating days): used as connective tissue/skin support and as an amino acid supplement during low energy/protein intake; omitted on fasting days to maintain complete fasting and maximize autophagy.

**1.3. Structure and implementation**

Eating days: 400–700 kcal (total average <500 kcal/day when fasting days are included).  
Fasting days: 48–72 hours after planned rotation.  
Fluid intake: 3–5 liters per day.

Electrolyte balance was maintained through systematic supplementation of sodium and magnesium, adapted to fasting periods and fluid intake. This part of the program was considered critical for physiological tolerance and stability throughout both the weight reduction and acclimatization phases.

On fasting days, 60–90 minutes of brisk walking was normally performed to stimulate circulation and fat mobilization, without intensity that could affect recovery or hormonal balance. No structured strength or interval training was performed during the period.

All data were recorded daily (date, working hours, weight).

**1.4. Results**

Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
01                          92                          Start  
06                          90                          First noticeable reduction  
16                          85                          Ketosis stable  
30                          80                          Halfway  
42                          77                          Plateau  
51                          75                          Last phase started  
67                          72                          Target weight reached  
74                          70                          End

Total weight loss: ≈ 22 kg in 10 weeks.  
Estimated distribution: 8–9 kg fat, 13–14 kg fluid/muscle.

**1.5. Observations**

·         Weight measurement was performed mainly in the morning after normal sleep and toilet visits, to ensure consistency.

·         Adaptation occurred after approximately two weeks.

·         Hunger response was significantly reduced, energy levels stable.

·         Sleep difficulties occurred during night shifts and towards the end of 72-hour fasting periods.

·         Short-term orthostatic hypotension, no persistent symptoms.

·         No headaches, cramps or electrolyte-related problems reported.

·         Physical exercise was deliberately omitted to avoid catabolic stress at extremely low energy intake.

·         Weight plateaus around 80, 77 and 75 kg were broken without adjustment of method.

·         Strict electrolyte control is considered the primary reason for stable physiological tolerance.

**1.6. Status at the end of phase 1**

Final measurement day 74, actual final weight ≈ 70 kg.  
Goal achieved within planned time and physiological limits.

This documentation is intentionally limited to structure and outcomes. No attempt is made to generalize or recommend the approach described.

**Two-Phase Fasting–Ketosis Protocol (Documented Case)**  
**PART 2 – Habituation and stabilization**

Phase 2 does not describe what should be done after weight loss, but what actually happened when further weight reduction was no longer desired.

**2.0. Context and delimitation**

This document describes phase 2 of the same self-directed experiment as presented in Part 1. Phase 2 starts immediately after the end of the weight reduction phase and is not a new regimen, but a goal adjustment within the same overall structure.

Where Part 1 had weight reduction as the primary endpoint, phase 2 is aimed at stabilization, regulation and assessment of sustained physiological response.

**2.1. Purpose**

The purpose of phase 2 was:

·         to stop further weight loss

·         to limit reactive weight gain

·         to preserve fasting adaptation and metabolic flexibility

·         to use fasting consciously as a regulatory mechanism, with autophagy as the guiding principle

Phase 2 was explicitly not intended as normalization or termination, but as an active transitional phase.

**2.2. Structure and framework**

The basic structure from phase 1 was continued without any fundamental changes. The eating pattern remained tightly organized, with clear demarcation of meals.

OMAD/OMAS was used as the organizational framework, where OMAD was defined operationally as one whole meal consumed within a short period of time (<30 minutes), not as an open eating window.

Fasting periods were continued, but in phase 2 were used selectively and purposefully. Fasting functioned as a regulatory tool, not as a continuous driving force for further weight reduction.

No structured training was introduced in phase 2.

**2.3. Dietary transition**

The diet was gradually liberalized within the existing framework. Carbohydrates, fat and social foods were gradually reintroduced, while protein remained a stable and dominant component of the meal structure.

Increased energy density and social load were deliberately included as part of phase 2, not as normalization per se, but as a load to assess the robustness and regulatory capacity of the system.

**2.4. Regulation and control**

Body weight was used as the overall management parameter in phase 2, with a focus on trend and interval rather than individual days.

Weight appeared to be dynamically regulated rather than statically stable. After periods without fasting, weight gain was observed over subsequent days, while weight quickly fell back with targeted regulation.

No cumulative buoyancy or persistent loss of control over time was observed. At the same time, further weight loss was actively avoided.

**2.5 Results – weight development in phase 2 (acclimatization)**

Phase 2 covers the period days 75–150 and represents the transition from active weight reduction to controlled stabilization. Body weight was used as the primary outcome variable, recorded sporadically but consistently, mainly in the morning.

Overall weight picture

·         Start phase 2: \~70 kg

·         End phase 2: \~70 kg

·         Net change: ≈ 0 kg

The weight remained within a limited interval of approximately 69–73 kg throughout the entire period.

Patterns and dynamics

·         Temporary weight gain occurred after several days of eating, increased alcohol intake and reduced fasting frequency.

·         Weight reduction occurred rapidly after 48–72 hours of fasting, without the need for further restrictions.

·         No cumulative weight gain was observed, despite the reintroduction of carbohydrates, fat and socially conditioned high energy intake.

·         Further weight loss was actively avoided and in practice stopped.

Representative data points (selection)  
Day                       Weight (kg)      Comment  
75                          70                         Start phase 2  
84                          69                         Lowest observed value  
99                          70                         After several days of fasting  
117                       71                          After Christmas party  
119                       73                          Temporary peak  
122                       70                          Reversed after fasting  
148                       70                          After high alcohol exposure  
150                       71                          End phase 2

\- Overall assessment  
Weight regulation appeared responsive and reversible, not slow or progressive. The system established in phase 1 remained operational in phase 2, but with changed function: from weight reduction to active stabilization and control.

**2.6. Observations**

\- Weight  
Body weight remained within a relatively narrow interval throughout phase 2. Short-term fluctuations occurred, especially in connection with increased energy load, but were consistently reversed. No progression in either a positive or negative direction was observed.

\- Energy and general condition  
Subjective energy level and function were reported as better than before the start of the project. Willingness to take action and perceived physical capacity were consistently high, without this being attributable to changes in training load.

\- Sleep  
Sleep disturbances occurred primarily in connection with fasting periods, especially with regard to falling asleep. Outside of these periods, sleep was reported as satisfactory. Sleep was not recorded quantitatively.

\- Stomach/intestines  
Stomach and intestinal function was variable. During longer fasting periods, changes in bowel patterns were observed, while function appeared more normalized with regular food intake. The data base is not sufficiently standardized to draw strong conclusions.

\- Behavior and routine attachment  
A significant reluctance to break routines established in phase 1 was observed. Fasting and structured meal patterns appeared to be the default, even when further weight loss was not desired. At the same time, more meals were gradually introduced on certain days, without this fully replacing the established structure.

**2.7. Reflections**

Phase 2 was characterized by ambivalence between fear of further weight loss and the desire to preserve control mechanisms that effectively limited reactive weight gain.

Fasting was experienced as both easier and harder than in phase 1: easier as a result of established adaptation, harder because the goal was now precise regulation rather than linear reduction.

Increased exposure to energy-dense food and social stress increased awareness of one's own responses and need for regulation.

The experience is considered to be unsuitable for generalization. The program requires a high degree of self-discipline, continuous self-monitoring and tolerance for both physiological and psychological stress. The risk of error is considered significant in others.  


The overall assessment is that the benefits can be significant, both physically and mentally, provided that the stabilization phase is treated as an active and conscious regulatory phase, not as an unstructured after-period.

Faith caught up with James just past the glass doors, where the hallway widened and the noise of the city leaked in. She studied him for a moment before speaking, the way she always had when she wanted to be sure of what she was seeing. His shoulders were still tight. His face looked older than it had a week ago. There was relief there, but it was thin, stretched over something heavier.

“You handled that well,” she said. “You sounded like your father.”

James let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding. “I don’t feel settled,” he said. The words surprised him with how quickly they came. “I thought I might. I don’t.”

Faith nodded, unsurprised. “Honoring someone doesn’t always feel like closure,” she said. “Sometimes it just feels like weight carried the right way.”

They stood there for a moment longer, then hugged. Not the kind of hug meant to fix anything. Just enough contact to say they were still connected. Faith turned back toward the elevators. James stepped outside.

The city took him immediately. Traffic rolled past in tight lanes. A delivery truck idled at the curb, its driver leaning against the door scrolling on his phone. Somewhere a siren wailed and faded. The air smelled like cold concrete and coffee and something fried. James walked without a destination, letting the rhythm of the sidewalks set his pace.

He crossed streets with strangers who never looked at one another. He passed a man arguing quietly into a headset, a woman balancing two cups of coffee with careful concentration, a couple stopped short on the corner because one of them had forgotten something important. James watched hands more than faces. Who held doors. Who waited. Who stepped aside.

By the time he reached the water, his legs ached in a dull, familiar way. He sat on a metal bench and leaned forward, forearms resting on his thighs. The river moved steadily, indifferent to the city built along its edge. Ferries cut slow paths through the gray surface. Wind came off the water sharp enough to sting his cheeks.

James watched people pass behind him and, without trying, began to see his father everywhere.

In the man who stood patiently while someone ahead of him struggled with a ticket machine.

In the woman who stopped to help a stranger pick up spilled papers.

In the quiet way a passerby adjusted a dropped scarf and moved on without expecting thanks.

Martin had lived like that. Not loudly. Not memorably in the way people told stories about. Just steadily, shaping space so other people could move through it more easily. James felt the ache of that loss press in again, familiar now, less sharp but no lighter.

He knew then he couldn’t stay in New York. The city demanded too much noise for what he needed next. Too many rooms that echoed his father’s absence. He had done what he came to do. Staying would only keep him orbiting the same questions, hoping they would eventually answer themselves.

Ohio felt different now. Smaller. Quieter. Honest. It was where his life waited. Not the life he had run from, but the one that required showing up in ordinary ways. Work. Neighbors. Decisions no one applauded. Chances to practice what his father had lived without naming.

James stood and pulled his jacket tighter against the wind. He took one last look at the water, at the city rising behind it, and felt something close to resolve settle in his chest.",1,1767794152.0,stories,0,1.0,False

1q6fx0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/MyWinterCar/comments/1q6fx0w/some_ideas_i_got_for_my_winter_car/,Some ideas I got for my winter car.,"1. Taxi customers should yap about their life. It could be a chance to add in some lore, as well as just making the job more realistic. Also there should be a VERY small chance that they will give you a small tip (10-30mk IN CASH) if you reply to them talking (by pressing k).

2. Peräjärvi should sometimes have its roads covered with a bit of sand. When it snows, roads irl are covered in some sand to make them less slippery. So the same thing should be in mwc. But I think it should only be in peräjärvi since i dont think someone would want to cover the entire highway in sand. The sand should make the roads slightly less slippery and the sand should not be there every day.

3. PSK should have people roaming around and buying stuff. Everything being restocked every day might be kinda op (although thats understandable since its a big company). So why not have some random people walk there and buy stuff? Also we will need to stand in a queue to buy things if there are any other people. The same should go for the restaurant, although queues there should be rare. The same could go for the gas station, but obviously having cars instead of people.

4. (extends 3rd idea) Add another job like the factory one but to PSK. You can either become the cashier or the dude in the restaurant. Although to apply there you must be completely sober and not drink at work and also it should be pretty hard to apply there overall. But the job should still feel the same as the factory job and not have any advantages over it.

5. Energy drinks/coffee should give you some kind of an addiction. Basically the more you drink the faster your fatigue rises. It could already be in the game but Im not sure.

6. A small chance that an advert in the magazine scams you. The two options of scam are a: the part is literally broken and b: the box is empty. The chance should not be too big tho. Also another option could be that one part from the advert is either missing, or its a part for some completely different car and its not compatible with the rivett.

My best guess is lupus and some food intolerances . )

Any input/ advice is appreciated.

	1.	Stiff and weak hands in the morning, hard to open a water bottle cap, usually lessens after 1/2  an hr to an hour.

	2.	 Fatigue. Always exhausted. 

	3.	Joint and muscle pain randomly; yesterday it was my ankle, the day before that, my wrist.

	4.	Eyes are super sensitive to light; I need to wear tinted contacts or glasses practically always to be relatively comfortable. Sunglasses  are worn during the day, and when night driving, I need protection against the headlights too.

	5.	Bright sunlight makes me tired.

	6.	Stomach issues that are lessened by avoiding gluten and dairy, but not diagnosed as celiac.

	7.	Currently have a mouth ulcer.

	8.	Dizzy/ nauseous spells occasionally.

	9.	Brain fog. Always.

	10.	Cough. I’ve developed a cough that tends to  kick in in the afternoon and evening. It started around Halloween, happening only while sleeping,  but has since increased frequency and time frame to happen sporadically every night and at every activity level.

	11.	Sore and stiff muscles. Always.

	12.	Very slow muscle recovery. Last time I rode a horse (for an hour, walking and posting the trot) I was sore and stiff for  two weeks in all the muscles  I used for that activity. Last time I switched my crunches from 50 normal crunches to 50side twist ones, I was sore for 4 days.

	13.	Frequent  need to pee. 

	14.	Often feeling dehydrated, despite drinking 3 bottles of water and 3  cups of coffee/ tea, and a protein shake four days a week. ( 2 bottles of water, 2 cups coffee, + a juice / soup/ smoothie the other days).

	15.	Likely anemic.

I’m afraid I made the wrong choice. I was leaning toward the Plus but was swayed by the iced brew options of the Pop.

I set the Pop up, ran the rinse cycle, and my first two cups of coffee have been full of grounds. Nespresso customer service was lovely and offered me an immediate return/replacement or said I could try another cup to see if it resolves. This morning’s cup was full of grounds again.

I’ve also noticed the crema on the Pop is nothing like what I’ve seen on other machines- it’s like big bubbles that deflate almost immediately. Folding it in seems to expedite the deflation. I know it’s not true crema on any of the Nespresso’s, but I feel like the cups I’ve had from a friend’s Plus have been way creamier.

So I’m left wondering… did I get a dud of a Pop and I should go ahead with the replacement hoping for no grounds/better crema? Or do I jump ship for the Vertuo Plus (which I’ll now have to source elsewhere since Nespresso appears sold out)?",1,1767793586.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

The Hook: 
The story opens in the back of a speeding ambulance. Vicky is covered in blood, holding the hand of his childhood sweetheart, Diya, as she fades in and out of consciousness. He is haunted by a single thought: This is all my fault.

The Romance:
Vicky and Diya have been inseparable since they were five years old in Hadapsar. Vicky has always been in love with the ""symmetrical"" girl next door, but he was too afraid to ruin their friendship. The story flashes back to a magical ""night of studies"" where a spilled coffee and a borrowed shirt lead to a heart-stopping confession. They aren't just boyfriend and girlfriend; they are ""Goals.""

The Shadows:
Their perfect bubble is threatened by three people:
• Tanishka: Vicky’s bitter ex-girlfriend who refuses to move on.
• Shams: Vicky’s ""ride-or-die"" best friend who brings loyalty and a bit of street-smart muscle to the story.
• Sakshi: A mysterious, ultra-wealthy businesswoman from Dubai. She’s India’s 7th richest woman, but she’s emotionally bankrupt. She becomes obsessed with Vicky, seeing him as a prize to be bought.

The Tragedy:
After a beautiful midnight escape to Bhosale Garden—where they share kulfi and watch a life-changing sunrise—tragedy strikes. A plot by Tanishka to ""scare"" the couple goes horribly wrong. To save Vicky from an oncoming SUV, Diya throws herself into its path.

The Devil’s Bargain:
With Diya in a coma and needing a rare medical stent only available through Sakshi’s private resources, Vicky is forced into a ""Golden Cage."" Sakshi agrees to save Diya’s life, but only if Vicky leaves his life behind to stay with her in Dubai for one year. Vicky accepts, choosing Diya’s life over his own heart.

The Redemption:
In a final twist at the airport, Sakshi looks at the broken man Vicky has become and realizes that a heart cannot be owned. In a rare act of selflessness, she tears up the contract and sets him free, choosing to find her own healing through philanthropy.

The Ending:
One year later, the ""Symmetry"" returns. Vicky and Diya sit at the same garden ledge where they once shared kulfi. Though Diya carries scars, their love is unshakable. The story concludes with the realization that for every moment of darkness, life provides a sunrise to balance the scales.",1,1767793485.0,TwentiesIndia,2,1.0,False

It’s wild to think about how much cheaper fast fashion is now but also how quickly that stuff falls apart. This coat has been through decades and is still going strong. I’ve taken it to the dry cleaners a few times, brushed it off here and there, and that’s it. No fancy treatments, no replacing buttons or anything major. Just solid, simple craftsmanship.

Makes me seriously reconsider every jacket or coat I’m tempted to buy these days. Sometimes spending a bit more on something built to last is worth it.

Everyone wants to be funnier. Whether it’s crushing Tinder banter, carrying a group chat, or just making a Zoom meeting less soulcrushing, being funny makes people like you, remember you, and trust you. It’s one of those social skills that seems “natural” for some, but let’s stop pretending it’s random. Humor isn’t magic. It's a learnable tool backed by science, psychology, and ruthless trial and error.  



The problem? Most advice online is either TikToklevel cringe (“just say outrageous stuff!”) or way too vague (“be yourself!”). So this is not another “just be confident” post. This is for people who want to actually learn how humor works and how to use it well — without being that one weird guy quoting Family Guy in 2024.  



This is built from books, psych research, podcasts from real comedians, and a lot of painfully unfunny testing. Good news: If you weren’t “born funny”, you're not doomed. And here’s why.

  
  


 Know what kind of funny you are (Yes, there are types)  

  A study from the University of Colorado Boulder discovered four distinct humor styles:  

   Affiliative: using jokes to connect with others and ease social tension. Think Jimmy Fallon.

   Selfenhancing: finding humor in life’s chaos to cope. Classic Bo Burnham vibes.

   Aggressive: sarcasm, roast battles, dark memes. Can land or crash depending on your social radar.

   Selfdefeating: making fun of yourself to get laughs. Relatable, but risky if it kills your selfworth.  



  Most people lean toward one or two. Figure yours out and then lean in. The Humor Styles Questionnaire (Martin et al., 2003) is a legit free test if you’re curious.

  
  


 Timing > punchline  

  A killer line said one second too late is dead. Comedy writers from Inside Amy Schumer and SNL say rhythm matters more than wit. As Judd Apatow explained on SmartLess Podcast, laughter is not about what you say, it’s when and how you say it.   

   Try pausing right before your punchline. It builds tension.  

   Use contrast: Set something up super seriously, then smash it with something silly. That shift triggers laughs.  

   Don’t rush. Nervous speed kills funny. Let the silence work for you — it makes the payoff hit harder.

  
  


 Steal the structure, not the jokes  

  Real comedians don’t just wing it. They use repeatable formats. Learn these like mental LEGO blocks:  

   Rule of 3: Set up with two normal things, then hit with something unexpected. Example: “I like books, coffee, and emotionally unavailable people.”  

   Misdirection: Lead people in one direction, then flip it. John Mulaney does this constantly.  

   Callbacks: Bring up something you said earlier in a new way. It rewards people for paying attention.  

  These aren’t formulas. They’re scaffolds. Use them to structure your jokes without sounding rehearsed.

  
  


 Watch smarter, not more  

  Bingeing TikTok “funny clips” won’t help. But active watching will. Research from Northwestern University found that comedy writing improves when people analyze why a joke works, not just enjoy it.  

   Watch standup specials with captions on. Pause. Ask: what made that line land?  

   Try Mike Birbiglia, Taylor Tomlinson, Hannah Gadsby — comics who blend story, timing, and weirdness.  

   From podcasts: Check out Good One by Vulture. It breaks down specific jokes with pro comedians. Wildly insightful.

  
  


 Practice like storytelling, not like a script  

  The best way to be funnier in convos? Tell stories, not jokes. Your brain remembers stories easier. People tune in. And if the punchline flops, the story still works.  

   Use real moments — awkward small talk, weird Uber rides, cringe DMs.  

   Focus on relatable pain. Neuroscience research from UCSB shows people laugh more when content taps into shared embarrassment or frustration.  

   Cut the extra fluff. Instead of saying “So like the other day I was maybe walking, I think it was Sunday...” just say: “Yesterday I walked into a glass door.” Boom. That’s already setup.

  
  


 Make your brain weirder on purpose  

  Funny comes from unusual connections. The more input you have, the more output your brain can remix.  

   Read absurd stuff: The book “Comedy Writing for LateNight TV” by Joe Toplyn is oddly brilliant.  

   Try improv games solo. The book Truth in Comedy (Halpern et al.) explains the “yes, and” mindset that keeps humor alive in any convo.  

   Consume outside your bubble. Mix random subreddits, old Vine compilations, or even cooking YouTube with a sarcastic narrator (shoutout to Binging with Babish). Input variety = output creativity.

  
  


 Most importantly: bomb often and recover faster  

  Even elite comedians bomb. Chrystyna Kouros, a psychologist at Southern Methodist University, found that emotional resilience was key to humor perception. People who learn to laugh at missed jokes get funnier faster.   

   If you say something awkward, OWN IT. Say “That was terrible, I’ll see myself out.” People laugh harder when you acknowledge the flop.  

   Don’t chase laughs. Chase connection. Humor is about making someone feel seen in a twisted, nerdy, or cringey way.  

   Being cringe is the entry fee. That’s how humor works. It’s practice in public.

  
  


This isn’t a 3step magic trick. It’s a rewiring. You’re not a robot — you’re a human, and humans are hilarious by default in the right context. Learn the rhythm, study the pros, and embrace small bombs.  



It’s not about faking a personality. It’s about turning up the volume on the funnier parts already in you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

When I first started diving into coding, I genuinely thought I was just not built for it. Every tutorial felt like I was trying to decipher ancient hieroglyphs while simultaneously juggling flaming chainsaws. My screen would just mock me with endless error messages, and honestly, the frustration was soul-crushing. I'd stare at lines of code, feeling this heavy wave of inadequacy wash over me, wondering if I should just pack it in and become a professional dog petter instead (which, let's be real, is a noble profession).

I remember one particularly brutal evening, probably around 2 AM, fueled by lukewarm coffee and pure stubbornness. I was wrestling with this seemingly simple `for` loop that just *refused* to behave. My eyes were burning, my brain felt like static, and I was on the verge of throwing my laptop out the window. Every time I hit 'run,' the same red text would scream back at me, an unyielding wall of 'syntax error.' My desk was a graveyard of crumpled snack wrappers and self-doubt.

Then, out of sheer desperation, I tried *one* more thing. A tiny, almost imperceptible change in indentation, a misplaced bracket I'd stared at a hundred times without seeing. I hit 'run,' bracing for the usual disappointment... and then, it happened. The program executed. Flawlessly. The terminal blinked green, not red, and the output was exactly what I’d been striving for. It was like the heavens opened, and a choir of digital angels started singing.

That feeling, that sudden, incandescent spark of understanding and triumph? It was like all the frustration, all the doubt, just melted away in an instant. It wasn't just about the loop; it was about cracking a code, literally and figuratively, in my own brain. It was a rush, a genuine thrill that made all those grueling hours suddenly worth it. From that moment, coding clicked in a way it never had before.

Has anyone else had that 'aha!' moment that completely changed their perspective on coding, or anything challenging for that matter? Share your stories! What was the specific problem that finally made things click for you?",1,1767793166.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Hes always been kind of clumsy but lately its been getting worse and its always her who ends up hurt.

Like hell be carrying something and trip and somehow the hot coffee lands on her. Or hell bump into her near the stairs. Or knock something off a shelf right as shes walking by. Every single time hes super apologetic and says he doesnt know whats wrong with him lately.

A few weeks ago we were all hanging out at their place and he was bringing her a cup of tea. I just had this gut feeling so I jumped up and grabbed it from him and asked him to grab me some popcorn instead. He looked at me weird but did it. Later another friend told me he was upset about it but when I asked her about it she told him a completely different version of what happened.

I couldnt stop thinking about it. The more I thought about all these accidents the more I realized they only ever happen to her. Never him. Never anyone else in the room. Just her.

So I brought it up with her. I tried to be gentle about it. I said something like I care about you and I want you to be safe and Ive noticed most of these accidents seem to happen to you.

She completely broke down. Said shes been feeling the same way for months but thought she was going crazy. She tried suggesting he see a doctor about the clumsiness and he brushed it off and said hes fine.

 She also told me that him and another friend in our group were joking about her being a battered wife and making dark jokes about how ridiculous it would be if he was actually hurting her on purpose. That made her feel like she was insane for even thinking it.

Shes not confrontational at all so shes just been quietly dealing with it while living with him.

We spent the day helping her move her stuff into her roommates room and shes staying with me now. She wrote him a letter ending things and hes packing up to leave since hes not on the lease.

I feel good about helping her but part of me wonders if I overstepped by saying something in the first place. Like what if I was wrong and I just blew up her whole relationship over a feeling

The aesthetic is beautiful and the ritual of tea service appeals to me. But would this furniture actually function in my home where everything else is Western style with regular height seating? Mixing furniture traditions seems like it could create interesting eclectic spaces or just look confused and mismatched. A traditional tea table with floor cushions in a living room with sofas and coffee table might be charming or awkward. I can't predict which without actually trying it.

I've found various tea tables online including beautiful options on online stores like in Alibaba showing traditional designs. The craftsmanship is impressive. But aesthetic appreciation doesn't guarantee practical functionality in different cultural contexts. The question is about successfully incorporating furniture from other traditions without cultural appropriation or aesthetic clash. Do mixed style homes work visually? Are traditional pieces functional when removed from their original contexts? Or is this one of those ideas that seems better in imagination than reality?

* Still have to figure out transportation around the city, from the airport and to Eindhoven.

Our kind of trip:

* Walking around and sightseeing
* Museums and art: contemporary art, photography and film/cinema. Don't mind going to the unmissable classics.
* Old libraries, thrift stores, local markets, alternative industrial areas
* Coffee and pastry, brunch, nappolitan pizza, asian food, foodies all around - want to try apple pie, Fabel fries and stroopwafels in Albert Cuyp

All her friends and my friends knew we'd last forever. I thought so too, and then she interned this summer. After she left our home town we found it difficult to do much other than talk. We both had busy summers, and made as much time for each other as possible. She started to tell me how upset she was at me for not planning and making fun activities through online. I realized she was right, but she started to ask for space from me. Me being a dumb, trusting boyfriend, I gave her space. I'm very attached and she's very avoidant and so it was almost impossible for me to give her space and I would cave every 2-3 days with a small text. I would ask if she was alright, or needed anything, and she would respond caringly but leave it short. That was our dynamic over most of the summer and then one day towards the end of july she told me that she cheated on me. She just told me that she kissed him. I had to pry for details and the most detail she would give me is that it lasted for longer than a minute. She wouldn't tell me anything else but she promised that it was all that had happened. I eventuallly forgave it, but obviously I was incredibly mad. Then as time went on, just 2 weeks ago in December She told me that the night during the summer, her friend who stayed the night in another bed in her apartment kissed her. She kissed him back, and they made out. Then they proceeded to take their shirts off and she had nothing on above her waist. He was touchy, and she didn't say a thing. She kept going on and then told me she didn't stop until he tried to untie her pants. She lied for 5 months. She then proceeded to tell me that wasn't the only instance of cheating.  Close to the beginning of July, she had danced with another man in the club. She went to the club with her female friend and had told me about it. I knew how boring it was for her to live out in this city with almost no other people that she knew. I didn't even think about any negatives when she told me she was going to the club. She actively texted me ""goodnight, I love you"" as she was dancing with another guy who was grinding on her. At that moment I felt like I was getting bad news every day. I literally couldn't believe it, and I still can't. She then told me there was also another instance of a man finding her at a coffee shop. a 27 year old. He asked for her instagram and she led him on. She never met that man again, but she admitted that she at the time made it seem like she was single and ready to go forward with this guy. I'm still with her. I don't want to leave, she really has helped me and been there for me for so long now. I don't know why she ruined our relationship this summer just for a couple hours of fun. I want to get over this as fast as possible but I know it's not how it works. It literally doesn't feel real as I type it right now either.

I work remotely in tech and have a healthy budget to support a high-end lifestyle. I’m also studying online for a bachelor in my free time so my schedule is a bit specific.

My main priority is a **""quiet luxury""** apartment. I am highly sensitive to noise pollution: no night markets, no major intersections, and I’m looking to avoid ""urban hell"" vibes. I’m looking for modern, well-managed buildings where I can work in peace, with some coworking spaces or like coffee shops to go work from once in a while. I don't need a huge place, but good amenities and soundproofing are absolute musts.

I’m currently around HSK3 (simplified) and want to continue studying chinese, but because of my degree, I need to limit study to about 10 hours per week total (including homework). Since most university programs require 15+ hours of class time for a visa, I’m looking for good private tutors or language centers that offer flexible, ""low-intensity"" high-quality instruction for professionals.

On the fitness front, I'm an athlete and I want to be within a 10-15 minute commute of a high-quality CrossFit box and a Muay Thai gym. I’ve looked into CrossFit Matrix and TMMA, but I’d appreciate feedback on these two or others I might have missed.

Socially, I’m an introvert and not into the clubbing scene, but I’m looking to build a high-quality social circle of fellow investors and professionals. Are there specific networking groups or private clubs (like the American Club) that are worth the membership for a self-employed foreigner?

Lastly, on the visa: Given my 10hr/wk study limit, I’m looking at the Digital Nomad Visa using the bank balance proof path, has anyone had some success with this recently and can give me some pointers, things to do / avoid?

My friend “Tara” and I have been close since our early 20s, the kind of friendship where we know each other’s coffee orders and can show up in sweatpants without apologizing. For years I told people she was my best friend and I meant it. Somewhere along the line though, being around her started making me feel like I was constantly failing a test I didn’t sign up for. Tara is one of those people who is always in motion, always improving, always optimizing, and she narrates it out loud. New routines, new goals, new courses, new hobbies, new “projects,” new rules for herself. When something good happens to me, she’s supportive for like five seconds and then she flips it into a pep talk about how I should do more. If I mention I’m tired, she’ll send me a list of vitamins. If I say I’m stressed, she’ll tell me to wake up at 5am and journal. If I share something I’m proud of, she’ll say she’s proud too, but then she’ll casually mention she did something similar and got a better result, like a little humble trophy she places on the table. The worst part is I started editing myself around her. I’d avoid saying I was sad because she’d “fix” it. I’d avoid saying I was happy because she’d turn it into a challenge. I’d avoid saying I was stuck because she’d look at me like I just wasn’t trying hard enough. I kept telling myself I was being sensitive, that this is what motivated friends do, that I should be grateful to have someone push me. But being pushed 24/7 doesn’t feel like love, it feels like you’re a before photo. Two months ago she got a job in another state and moved. Everyone expected me to be devastated. I cried a little the day she left, and then the next morning I woke up and the air felt different. My phone stayed quiet. I didn’t have that tight feeling in my chest like I needed to be more interesting, more productive, more shiny, more anything. I realized how much energy I’d been spending just managing her reactions, trying to be the friend she likes, the friend she can feel proud of, the friend she can “help.” She still texts me updates and voice notes, and I reply like normal, but there’s this awful peace I don’t want to admit. I miss the old version of us, I miss laughing until we snorted and being messy together, but I don’t miss feeling small in my own life. I hate that it took distance for me to feel like myself again, and I hate that a part of me hopes she stays busy enough that she doesn’t come back soon.

1q6faad,https://i.redd.it/o07ezph7ixbg1.jpeg,Stuck? Try changing the order….,"
Habits aren’t just what we do.
They’re the order we do things in.

Your brain learns sequences.
Morning → coffee → phone.
Stress → scroll → numb.
Shower → hair → body → done.

Over time, those sequences become automatic.

This is where neuroplasticity comes in.

Neuroplasticity isn’t “do one random thing differently.”
It isn’t a quick trick.
And it isn’t about forcing yourself to change.

Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to rebuild patterns through repeated practice.

You don’t erase a habit.
You build a new one — by practicing a different sequence often enough that it becomes familiar.

That’s why, when people are rebuilding their lives — including in recovery — the focus isn’t just on stopping a behavior.
It’s on rebuilding routines, rituals, and daily patterns in healthier ways.

Something as simple as a shower can be a real, practical example of how this works.

If you always wash your hair first, try starting with your legs.
The next day, try your back.
The next day, change the order again.

You didn’t add effort.
You didn’t fix your life.
You practiced a new sequence.

Your brain noticed.

Showering is just one example.
The same process applies anywhere you feel stuck — once you identify the habit or pattern you want to rebuild.

Neuroplasticity works through practice, not pressure.

Practice becomes familiar.
Familiar becomes habit.

If something in your life feels stuck,
you don’t have to overhaul everything.

Try changing the order. 🌱

Peace and give yourself mad props when getting unstuck:)

(20 minutes at MAXIMUM) and told him that i didnt wanted to drive 2 hours for 20 seconds...which after few heated things he blocked me. The thing is i still have his stuff and him mine.

I’ve started out at 18g in - 36g out, which almost always results in a sour shot (under extraction). When I grind finer, the espresso has a really hard time coming out of the basket. So grinding finer isn’t really an option anymore. 

I’ve raised the brewing temp. from 91 to 95 degrees, which doesn’t really add any more sweetness to the espresso. 

After this, I’ve tried adjusting my yield from 36g up to 42g (and even pulled lungo’s at 54g). Every shot still has the sourness and extracting the coffee longer usually results in a more watery/diluted shot. 

I have really soft water at home (I have a water softener), so I started using spring water from bottles (which should have the right quality according to multiple websites). 

I’ve changed beans multiple times and already went through 2kg of coffee and an insane amount of puck prepping (using WDT tool, spring loaded tamper, Normcore high extraction basket and puck screen).

1q6ez6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/B1B2Visas/comments/1q6ez6o/our_usa_b1b2_visa_approval_story/,Our USA B1B2 Visa Approval Story,"Our USA B1/B2 Tourist Visa Journey – A 2-Month Roller-Coaster 🇺🇸✈️

Applying for a US Tourist Visa was something my wife and I had been discussing for a while. We weren’t in a rush—we just knew that we wanted to visit the United States sometime in the coming few years.

I’m an Orthopaedic Surgeon, and my wife is currently in her final year of residency in Family Medicine. Like most people, we first did what everyone does—we enquired with multiple travel agents. And almost unanimously, the response was the same:

“Don’t expect an appointment for at least 1.5 to 2 years.”

Honestly, that was disappointing. A bit demotivating too.

Enter Atlys – Almost as an Afterthought

A couple of days later, the missus suddenly remembered Atlys. We had used it earlier for one of our UAE trips, and the experience back then was smooth. So we thought—why not? Let’s just take a chance.

Truth be told, I didn’t really believe their claim of getting appointments within 3 months. The odds were clearly against us.

Still, on 8th September, I sat down one fine day, filled in all the details, completed the DS-160, and paid the visa fees. Coincidentally (and luckily), I managed to pay the old B1/B2 fee before the hike.

And then… we forgot about it.

I didn’t even bother opening the app again because in my head, I was convinced nothing would happen anytime soon.

The Call That Changed Everything

In the second week of November, the missus had gone to Hong Kong and Macau with her parents. While she was there, she received a call from the Atlys helpline.

They said—“Your appointment has been booked.”

She informed me immediately. I checked the app—and honestly, I couldn’t believe my eyes.

✔️ Biometrics (OFC): 30th November

✔️ Visa Interview: 9th December

Unbelievable—but absolutely true.

Biometrics Day – Smooth & Surprisingly Fast

I quickly gathered all the documents—nothing too complicated.

We travelled to Mumbai on 29th November since our OFC appointment was on 30th November at 1:20 PM.

We stayed at Hotel Trident, BKC, which is very close to the Mumbai Visa Application Centre (VAC). After a quick lunch, we reached the VAC by 12:30 PM.

There’s no shed outside, so people were standing on the footpath—around 60–70 applicants. Within about 10 minutes, our time slot was announced and we were let inside.

There’s a locker facility inside where I deposited my mobile phone for ₹500.

Inside:

 • DS-160 was checked

 • A sticker was placed on the rear cover of the passport

 • Then another queue for biometrics

The officer verified our names and dates of birth, took four-finger fingerprints, followed by both thumbs, stamped the DS-160 with the date—and that was it.

The entire process took about 20 minutes.

We actually came out before our official appointment time even started.

The Long Interview Day

Between the two appointments, we organised our ITRs, bank statements, and letters on our own letterheads.

We travelled back to Mumbai on 8th December since our Visa Interview was scheduled at 8:50 AM on 9th December.

Once again, we stayed at Trident, BKC—from where the US Consulate is barely 50 metres away.

After an ultra-fast breakfast, we reached the consulate by 7:40 AM.

In about 10 minutes, they announced our slot. Once again, applicants were standing outside without any shed. Our passport stickers were checked, and we were let inside.

At that moment, it truly felt like we had stepped onto foreign territory on Indian soil.

Inside the Consulate

After multiple layers of security checks—honestly, stricter than most airports—we were taken inside.

📌 Small note: There is a locker facility inside the consulate as well, UPI only, ₹100.

We were then made to sit in a long row of chairs—which were not comfortable at all. It’s a long open hallway with a tin shed above, with washrooms and drinking water available.

All visa categories were present, but applicants were neatly segregated into different rows. Those opting for interviews in regional languages were fewer in number and were cleared much faster.

After a long wait of nearly 2 hours, we were finally moved to another queue—for biometric verification again.

An Indian lady checked our passports, took left-hand fingerprints, and rather unceremoniously handed the passports back—very much like a government office experience 😅.

The Moment of Truth

Finally, we stood in the queue for the actual interview.

Somewhere in between, I noticed Samay Raina, in his trademark black T-shirt and jeans, there for his own interview.

Then came our turn.

Both of us were called together to the counter.

We smiled and said, “Good Morning.”

The visa officer took our passports and asked:

Q: How are you related?

👉 Husband and wife.

Q: What do you do for a living?

👉 I’m an Orthopaedic Surgeon.

👉 My wife is in her final year of Family Medicine residency.

Q: Where have you travelled in the past?

👉 Europe, UAE, Mauritius, Hong Kong, Macau.

And before we could elaborate any further, she smiled and said the golden words:

✨ “Congratulations, your visa application has been approved.” ✨

That was it.

We were overjoyed, said a heartfelt Thank You, and walked out.

The Final Happy Ending

While exiting, I noticed a counter selling tea, coffee, and snacks—but we skipped everything. We had opted for courier delivery of our passports.

Exactly 4 days later, on 13th December, our passports arrived via Bluedart Courier—with the most sought-after US visa stamped inside.

And just like that, what everyone said would take 2 years, happened in 2 months.

Nothing like a well-made coffee and some cafe ambiance to get through some admin tasks.

As such, I’ve taken a liking to a local coffee spot in town this year with a super cozy set up and very nice barista.

It all started when I walked in one day to do some work and heard the most ear assaulting noise junk I had heard in a while. I’m generally pretty good at tuning out background noise, but this was too much— distractingly heinous. Thus began a series of several visits to the café, where this was the only music they were playing…for HOURS..and I began going off in my sibling group chat about how bad it was and how I had to keep leaving earlier than planned in order to escape.

Tired of my bitching, my one sister tells me to suck it up and talk to the barista nicely about changing it. Good point, I thought. Of course, at the risk of presenting as a Karen I worked hard to calculate the most polite way possible I could ask the barista to change the music. Then, my trusty intuition told me to Shazam a song first to figure out exactly who this peace assailant was. 

An artist popped up. It was the fucking barista. This person who I had come to adore who consistently made me the best Red Eyes I’ve had. Something is so painful to me about how sincere he is about his music and I can’t get over how bad it is. I never ended up saying anything I’ve stopped going to the café.

**T+04:18:00 (Pulse 172)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

History, Mara decided, smelled like warm plastic and burnt coffee and the faint metallic bite of stress-sweat drying on forearms. It was never incense. It was never parchment. It was fluorescent light heat and the soft, constant whir of machines that did not get afraid, even when the people around them did.

The control room had filled the way a lifeboat fills. Not with panic. With gravity. People who “weren’t on shift” had arrived anyway, drawn by the anomaly like iron filings to a magnet. Their jackets lay draped over chair backs like shed skins. Someone had brought in a bag of pastries hours ago; it sat untouched, growing stale in the corner, a small offering to a normal day that never showed.

Cables braided across the floor. Extra laptops glowed on every flat surface. A few conversations tried to start and died mid-sentence, strangled by the same thought everyone was carrying: if you look away you might miss the moment the universe snaps.

On the wall, the Sun owned the room the way it always did. A disk of impossible brightness made safe by layers of optics and code and human humility. But it no longer felt like a thing they were studying.

It felt like a thing waiting.

It had thrown its tantrum already. The knot had gone. The coronal mass ejection had peeled away with that sickening structural grace, a shell leaving as if it had been unlatched. In a normal day, the Sun would now return to its regular ugly: the familiar, comforting violence of convection and tangled fields and a thousand competing clocks that never agreed.

It did not return.

It held.

Granulation still crawled across the photosphere, but the crawling had lost its teeth. The convection cells rose and fell like they always did, yet the boundaries looked softened, as if stochastic edges had been sanded down. The flows were still flows, but they began to align in small, unearned ways, hints of organization that should not survive contact with a star’s boiling impatience.

Mara had been trained to distrust beauty in data. Beauty was often a pipeline artifact, a calibration error, a human mind forcing symmetry onto noise. But this wasn’t beauty.

This was obedience.

On her second monitor the helioseismology overlay ran like a ghosted hymn. A living cathedral of modes, all the Sun’s murmuring frequencies mapped into peaks and valleys and delicate, wandering lines. There should have been drift. There should have been phase slippage. There should have been the messy humility of a real star doing real star things.

Instead there was the spike.

A narrow, arrogant line rising out of the noise floor like a blade pulled from a sheath. Ninety seconds, unblinking. Not a bump. Not a broad swell. A peak so tight it looked inked on the page.

Pulse 172 arrived, and the disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun with the same phase it had kept for hours, a synchronized inhale that did not care about convection, did not care about differential rotation, did not care about what should happen in a turbulent plasma sphere.

It landed right where it had landed before.

It landed right where it would land again.

Jun stood beside her with his hands braced on the edge of a console, posture rigid in that way of people who have discovered their body has opinions their mind hasn’t approved yet. His voice had dropped into the register people used in churches and courtrooms and emergency rooms. Not because he was trying to be dramatic. Because loudness felt like a violation.

“It’s not decaying,” he said.

Mara didn’t answer him right away. She watched the spectrum, watched the linewidth, watched the stubborn refusal of the peak to broaden. She watched the phase lock. She watched the Sun do the one thing it never did: keep time like it meant it.

Her throat felt tight, not with fear of impact or flare. This was a different kind of dread, colder and cleaner. The dread of an equation balancing when it had no right to.

A coherent oscillation in a star should damp. That was basic. Convection should shred it. Differential rotation should smear it. Magnetic turbulence should chew it up and spit it back out as noise.

This one held as if held.

Mara forced her hands to stay still on the mouse. In her mind, a thought assembled itself from spare parts, snapping together with the ugly confidence of a machine finding its final bolt.

This isn’t relaxation.

This is a hold state.

Pulse 172 completed. The Sun breathed on schedule. The peak remained razor-thin. The room remained full of people who didn’t want to leave, because leaving would mean admitting they had no control over the next tick.

Mara felt the terror that had taken root since the CME tighten its grip, not the familiar fear that the Sun could hurt them, it always could.

Something worse.

The fear that the Sun could be handled.

And that whatever had its hand on the handle was patient enough to wait.

**T+04:30:00 (Pulse 180)**  
*NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center, Boulder*

In Boulder, the word syncing had been quarantined.

Not officially. Not with a memo or a policy. It just stopped being said, the way certain words stop being said in hospitals after a bad outcome. A superstition dressed up as professionalism. As if naming the thing gave it teeth.

So people reached for safer language. Persistent periodicity. Anomalous global mode. Continued coherence signature. Phrases with enough syllables to feel like a barrier.

They said them as if vocabulary could reduce amplitude.

It didn’t.

DeShawn Patel’s world had narrowed to screens and timestamps. The operations floor was bright in that exhausting way offices are bright at night, fluorescents flattening everything into the same pale urgency. The big wall display showed the Sun in false color. Under it, a stack of plots that should have looked like weather.

They looked like a metronome.

He didn’t hear the ninety-second beat, not with his ears. The room was too full of phone rings and keyboard chatter and the dry hiss of ventilation. But he could feel the beat anyway, the way you feel a distant bass note through a wall: a repeating pressure that your body starts anticipating.

Ninety seconds.

Ninety seconds.

Ninety seconds.

The schedule board on the side monitor was useless now. Every slot labeled call had become the same call, stretched and braided into a single, sleepless thread. The phone trees weren’t waking up anymore. They were already lit, a permanent fever of headsets and quick voices and the careful cadence of people trying not to infect each other with panic.

A satellite operator from the East Coast came on the line and said, too calmly, “We’re seeing timing jitter.”

DeShawn marked it without reacting. Timing jitter happened. It belonged to the catalog of mundane problems. But then the operator added, “And it’s periodic.”

That was the poison. Not the symptom. The rhythm.

Another liaison cut in: “Sensor baselines drifting. Tiny. Like bruises in the data. Every ninety seconds.”

Then: “Power system ripple. Synchronized across components that shouldn’t be talking to each other.”

Then: “GPS-derived timing chains are clean, but the payload clocks are… responding.”

It was always that word now, slipping into reports like a confession. Responding. As if the machines were hearing something.

Nothing anyone said sounded like catastrophe. No one was yelling about losing vehicles. No one was shouting about cascading failures. The satellites weren’t dropping like flies.

But everything felt wrong in the way hair feels wrong when it stands up before thunder.

DeShawn listened to a NASA liaison try to keep their voice neutral while describing “unexpected periodic perturbations,” and he kept his own face bland because that was what ops people did. Their job was to be the boring surface above a deep, dangerous current. People borrowed calm the way they borrowed flashlights in a blackout.

Behind him, Liz leaned in just enough for him to hear her without the microphones picking it up.

“The internet thinks it’s a heartbeat now,” she muttered.

DeShawn didn’t turn. He didn’t need to. He could feel the public the way you feel pressure change before a storm hits. It was in the tension of every phone call, the new sharpness in every question. The way every conservative sentence they released got shredded online and rebuilt into something unrecognizable, something hungry. Hashtags were now doing what observatories used to do: distributing attention faster than expertise could keep up, making noise louder than signal.

He rubbed his thumb along the edge of his pen until he felt the ridge catch his skin. Grounding. A tiny physical truth in a day that kept becoming abstract.

He leaned toward the microphone and spoke into the living knot of voices.

“We need a predictive statement,” he said. His voice stayed even, not because he felt even, but because the room needed someone to sound like the floor was still there. “Something testable. Otherwise we’re just narrating.”

On the other end of the line, there was a pause. A small, human hesitation.

Then someone cleared their throat.

Not a space weather person. Not a solar seismologist. Not one of the usual voices that lived in this domain.

It was Elias Venn.

---

**T+04:31:30 (Pulse 181)**  
*Particle Physics Lab, University Office with Too Many Coffee Cups*

Elias had started printing his notes because screens felt like promises.

A screen could flicker. A screen could update. A screen could be wrong in a way you didn’t notice until you’d already believed it. Paper stayed where you put it. Paper let you circle a number until it became a bruise.

His office looked the way truth looks right before it gets accepted: messy, exhausting, and deeply unflattering. Preprints in leaning towers. A whiteboard full of half-erased integrals that had started as homework and ended as omen. Coffee cups in various stages of fossilization, the ring stains like tree lines marking the passing of hours.

Across his desk, the printouts lay spread like a nest built by an anxious bird: power spectra, phase plots, timing chains, hand-sketched diagrams of coupled oscillators. Between them were sentences that weren’t quite sentences yet, fragments he’d written as if he could trap the shape of the day by naming it fast enough.

In the center, circled so many times the ink had cut into the fibers, was a number that kept refusing to be coincidence.

320.

He held the conference headset close and spoke with the careful tone of a man trying not to get thrown out of a moving vehicle.

“I know you don’t want to hear tunneling,” he said. He could feel the room stiffen on the other end, the bristle transmitted through fiber and compression like static. “So don’t call it tunneling. Call it a state transition. Call it transport. Call it anything you can live with and still keep your eyes open.”

A solar physicist cut in immediately, sharp enough to draw blood. “You are out of field.”

Elias stared at the circled number like it might grant him permission. He swallowed once, hard.

“Yes,” he said. “I am. The star didn’t stay in its field either.”

Silence tightened. Not empty silence. The kind that gathers weight.

He pressed forward while the door was still cracked.

“This oscillation isn’t just present,” he said. “It’s behaving like a requirement. It’s not wandering the way stellar modes wander. It’s locking. That’s the point. A chaotic system can ring. A chaotic system doesn’t hold phase like this unless it’s being driven or constrained.”

He tapped the paper with his finger. The sound was small in his office, but in his mind it landed like a gavel.

“It’s acting like a coupling condition,” he continued. “Like a lock. And locks have keys. Keys have timing.”

DeShawn’s voice came through the speaker, calm and thin, the way calm sounds when it’s being rationed. “Be specific, Doctor.”

Elias felt his stomach drop because specificity meant you were leaving the safety of theory and stepping onto the ledge.

He looked down at the number again, the circle around it dense enough to look angry.

“Eight hours,” he said. “From the onset of the locked mode. Eight hours at ninety seconds per pulse is exactly three hundred and twenty cycles. That’s… too neat. If the system is being held until an external boundary condition is satisfied, then you should expect a discrete event at a discrete cycle count.”

A pause on the line. Someone breathed too close to their microphone. A faint click as someone muted themselves to swear.

A scientist said, with the flat skepticism of someone protecting their own sanity, “You’re guessing.”

Heat crawled up Elias’ neck, the old flush of embarrassment arriving even when embarrassment was a luxury. “Yes,” he said. “I’m pattern-matching. On the most hostile dataset imaginable. But it’s the kind of guess you can falsify.”

DeShawn didn’t soften it. “What event.”

Elias hesitated. He could feel the social immune system in the room lean forward, ready to quarantine him. He could already hear the jokes people would make to keep breathing. He could already see the emails tomorrow that would say thanks for your input and mean stay in your lane.

He forced the words out anyway because fear didn’t make him careful anymore. It made him honest.

“Departure,” he said. “The Sun leaves.”

For a fraction of a second, the line held a brittle hush. Then someone made a sound that might have been laughter or coughing or the beginning of a denial reflex.

A senior voice snapped, “Enough.”

Elias flinched, but he didn’t retreat. He couldn’t. The number had teeth. The phase plot had teeth. The Sun had teeth.

DeShawn didn’t snap back. He didn’t laugh. He did something worse, something that meant the room had started treating the unthinkable as a checklist item.

“If you’re right,” DeShawn asked, “do we see any precursors.”

Elias’ eyes flicked to his laptop where the metronome video still sat open, paused mid-swing, the toy demonstration that had stopped being a toy. He hated how childish it looked beside the printouts of a star refusing to decohere.

“The phase won’t drift,” he said. “Not even a little. It will stay locked all the way. And near the end… it’ll look over-controlled. Narrower linewidth. Cleaner peak. Less jitter than you have any right to see in a convective star.”

He swallowed and added, quieter, because quiet was how you said the part that mattered.

“And that will be your warning. Because it means the system isn’t persisting. It’s being held.”

Elias waited for dismissal. He waited for the polite dismissal, the professional dismissal, the kind that let everyone go back to pretending this was weather.

Instead DeShawn said, “Noted.”

Again.

Noted, the small word that meant contingency had become a file folder. A plan. A line item. A thing you prepared for without admitting you believed.

Elias sat back in his chair and felt his heart slam once against his ribs, violently human, violently messy, nothing like the Sun’s clean, obscene tick.

He didn’t feel vindicated.

He felt hunted by a number.

**T+05:12:00 (Pulse 208)**  
*Venus Orbiter Operations, Night Shift Room with Dim Lights*

By the time the bulk disturbance reached Venus, the room had stopped smelling like coffee.

Coffee was what you drank when you believed you were managing normal. Coffee was the scent of routine, of checklists and scheduled downlinks and quiet competence.

Now it smelled like sweat and warm electronics and the sharp, dry edge of fear being held in the mouth like a nail.

Night shift rooms always felt like submarines, Rina had thought when she first started doing this. Dim light to keep eyes adjusted. Low voices. Screens glowing blue like aquarium glass. A humming quiet that said: you are sealed in here with the planet.

Tonight the planet did not feel far away.

On the main display, VESPER hung in its orbit like a patient lantern, its sensors pointed down at Venus’ bruised curve. The nightside should have been a subtle thing: faint airglow, quiet chemistry, the soft leak of heat into space.

Instead the nightside was lit as if Venus had become a surface for writing.

Rina watched the induced magnetosphere compress into a shape that looked wrong even in false color. Venus didn’t have Earth’s internal shield. It borrowed one, a temporary umbrella made from the solar wind’s argument with the ionosphere. It was supposed to flex and flutter, messy and alive.

This was not flexing.

This was being crushed.

The first arrival, nearly an hour ago, had been the light-speed slap: radiation, ionization, the sudden tightening of the upper atmosphere. Sharp and immediate, like a bright flash in a dark room.

Now the heavy body came.

The slow punch after the flash.

The plots buckled as if someone had leaned their weight onto the lines. Particle counts surged. The induced tail behind the planet snapped into a tighter, narrower geometry, then reformed, then tightened again, each cycle leaving the model fits worse than before. The system was no longer behaving like a boundary being pushed.

It was behaving like a boundary being hammered.

On the ultraviolet feed, the glow that had started as ribbons became sheets. Bands of emission widened until they were less like aurora and more like floodlight spill, as if someone had poured luminous paint over the nightside and watched it crawl.

A protection banner blinked across the interface, bright and indifferent:

UV CAM: SATURATION THRESHOLD EXCEEDED  
AUTO-GAIN REDUCTION ENGAGED

Then another.

SHUTTER CYCLE LIMIT APPROACHING  
THERMAL LOAD INCREASING

VESPER tripped a protection routine. Then did it again ten minutes later.

Rina’s teammate swore under his breath, the sound muted and exhausted. He leaned closer to the screen, eyes reflecting the pale fire of the plots. His voice came out flat with disbelief, like he was reading a sentence he didn’t accept as real.

“Safe mode risk,” he said. “If the shutters keep cycling like this, we’ll cook something.”

Rina didn’t answer. Her fingers were already moving, flipping through channels, correlating time tags. She didn’t have the luxury of reacting with words. Words were for after.

The event, at this scale, was not rhythmic anymore. It was a storm. The kind of storm that made you forget there had ever been quiet.

But underneath the storm, she kept seeing it.

Buried in the noise. A ghost line threading through the chaos.

A repeating squeeze.

A repeating release.

Every ninety seconds, as if Venus’ borrowed shield had learned the Sun’s new rule and couldn’t stop obeying it.

Rina felt her throat tighten in that precise way it tightened when a coincidence became a pattern. Patterns were dangerous. Patterns meant someone upstream was touching the whole system with a steady hand.

Her eyes flicked to the timestamp and then to the next marker.

Pulse-aligned again.

She swallowed and whispered, too low for the room’s microphones to pick up.

“Boulder,” she said. “They have to see this too.”

It wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a prayer. It was logistics, sharpened by dread.

She opened the message template and hesitated for one fraction of a second, because the internet had taught everyone the same bad lesson: if you name the monster, the monster becomes entertainment.

She did not write aliens.

She did not write magic.

She did not write anything that would give the world a story before it had truth.

She attached the packet: time series, instrument metadata, correlation highlights. She highlighted the obscene part, the part that did not belong:

~90 s periodic compression signature persists across storm envelope.

Then she wrote the only honest sentence she could justify.

Persistent global periodic driver still present.

Send.

The transmission icon blinked and the packet disappeared into the relay chain, racing back toward Earth at the speed of a confession.

Rina stared at Venus’ glowing nightside as another surge rolled through the plots, the magnetosphere compressing again like a lung taking a forced breath.

It wasn’t beautiful anymore, not even in the wildfire way. It was instructive. It was the planet demonstrating a principle: when the driver is global, everything downstream becomes an instrument.

She watched another ninety-second squeeze surface under the storm and understood, with sudden cold clarity, what her training had never prepared her to say.

This wasn’t weather.

Weather didn’t keep time.

**T+06:00:00 (Pulse 240)**  
*Public feeds, everywhere*

By six hours, the memes had aged.

They didn’t stop. Humor didn’t stop. Humor was a reflex, an involuntary flinch against terror, the mind’s way of touching a hot stove with a glove so it could pretend it wasn’t burning. But the jokes changed tone the way laughter changes tone in a hospital waiting room: still laughter, technically, but threaded with the knowledge that something irreversible might be happening behind a door you can’t open.

At first, #SunSync had been a punchline with a metronome sound. A clock emoji under a solar gif. Someone had edited a heartbeat monitor over a coronagraph loop and called it “the Sun’s Spotify Wrapped.”

Now the edits were quieter. The captions shorter. The humor stopped being clever and started being defensive.

People posted graphs like talismans.

Screenshots of power spectra with a single obscene spike circled in red, shared and reshared until the pixels broke down into blur. Someone would write, I don’t know what this means but it feels wrong, and the comment thread would become a crowd of strangers holding each other up with half-learned vocabulary and borrowed confidence.

They refreshed dashboards they didn’t understand. They learned to read timestamps the way people learn to read EKGs when someone they love is in a bed. There was comfort in the repetition, even when the repetition was the problem. Comfort in seeing the same line land in the same place again, because predictability, even when it’s monstrous, feels like a railing.

Ninety seconds.

Again.

Again.

The word coherence spread the way certain words do online, replicated faster than meaning. People used it the way they used quantum when they wanted to sound brave around something they couldn’t touch. It became a charm you could hold up like a cross.

It’s just coherence. It’s just a mode. It’s just a signal.

As if just could domesticate it.

Livestreams proliferated. Some were slick, ring-lit science communicators trying to keep their smiles from cracking. Some were shaky phone recordings of laptops. Some were nothing but a dashboard feed and a chat moving too fast to read. The world had built itself a collective window, and now it couldn’t stop looking through it.

In one corner of the internet, a prayer circle ran twenty-four hours a day. They streamed a false-color Sun and recited psalms between updates, voices soft and earnest. The chat was full of candle emojis and whispered fear dressed as faith.

In another corner, a doomsday thread collected like a storm drain, sucking in every anxiety people already carried. Prophecy quotes. Radiation maps. Old solar apocalypse movies clipped into thirty seconds of doom.

In yet another corner, calm threads tried to do what calm threads always did: hold the line. People posted explanations. They posted caveats. They posted the same safety warnings until they felt like spells.

Do not look at the Sun.  
Solar filters only.  
Do not panic.  
We don’t have evidence of immediate danger.

Every time someone typed do not panic, the replies grew sharper. Not because the statement was wrong, but because people could smell the effort behind it.

Then came the grifters.

They arrived the way vultures arrive, with unhurried certainty. A storefront link. A countdown banner. A product shot of cheap plastic and false authority.

“SunSync Protection Kit! EMF Shielding! Solar Pulse Defense! Limited stock!”

Comments flooded in, half mocking, half desperate.

This is a scam.  
What if it isn’t?  
Has anyone tested it?

Fear didn’t make everyone gullible, but it made everyone tired, and tired people reached for anything that looked like control.

Meanwhile, actual scientists begged, publicly, privately, in threads and on livestreams, in the exhausted tone of people explaining gravity to a room full of drowning.

“This is a data anomaly we are investigating.”  
“It is not visible to the naked eye.”  
“We don’t know what it means yet.”  
“Please stop staring at the Sun.”

They were answered with the internet’s favorite weapon: certainty.

“It’s aliens.”  
“It’s the military.”  
“It’s God.”  
“It’s fake.”  
“It’s the end.”  
“It’s nothing.”

Certainty was cheaper than fear.

In between the loud camps were the quiet people. The ones who didn’t post. The ones who watched. The ones who stared at a dashboard and felt their heart tick in sympathy with a star.

A nurse on break watched a live plot between patient checks and whispered, “Please stop,” like the Sun could hear her through the screen. A truck driver refreshed a feed at a rest stop and kept glancing up at the sky as if it might look different. A teenager filmed their face reacting to a graph they didn’t understand, tears coming anyway, and the comments were surprisingly gentle.

Under it all, the pulse persisted. Patient. Precise. Indifferent to meaning.

That was the part people couldn’t metabolize: the Sun wasn’t escalating, wasn’t fading, wasn’t behaving like a tantrum. It was doing a steady thing for a steady reason.

And then someone built a website.

At first it was a joke. A little black page with a yellow circle icon and a bouncing metronome. A title that tried to stay funny.

SUNSYNC PULSE COUNTER

It pulled timestamp data from public feeds and counted down to the next ninety-second tick. It had a silly sound effect you could toggle: tick… tick… tick…

It got shared as a meme in the first hour.

Then people realized the countdown hit zero exactly when the next pulse showed up on the plots.

Again.

Again.

Again.

The joke stopped being a joke and became a clock.

People opened it “just to see.” People left it running on second monitors. People put it up on TVs in bars like a sports game. People who had never cared about heliophysics in their lives started measuring their breathing against a star.

Tick.

Tick.

Tick.

And slowly, across continents and time zones, something changed in the collective posture of humanity: a subtle tightening, a held inhale. The feeling you get right before a roller coaster drops, when the track is still climbing but your body already knows the next shape.

Because when a universe gives you a countdown, you don’t laugh the same way anymore.

You listen.

**T+07:12:00 (Pulse 288)**  
*DKIST Control Room, Haleakalā Observatory*

Mara hadn’t moved much in hours, but she felt older anyway.

Not older in the dramatic way, not the kind you could photograph. Older in the quiet, cellular way you age when your mind has been pressed up against a fact and forced to stay there until it stops flinching. Her shoulders ached from holding still. Her eyes felt sanded. Somewhere in her body a tremor lived, not visible, just present, like a motor running under the skin.

Around her, the room had settled into a late-stage vigil. People spoke less now, not because they had nothing to say, but because language had started to feel like an insult. Cables still crisscrossed the floor. Monitors still glowed. The wall still held the Sun like a pinned specimen. The pastries in the corner had become a small, stale monument to morning.

The Sun did not decohere.

It did not drift.

It did not forgive.

Those were not poetic thoughts. They were the only three lines her brain could form without lying.

Pulse 288 arrived.

The disk-wide Doppler sweep rolled across the Sun with the same phase it had kept since the lock took hold, a star-sized inhale so consistent it made her teeth ache. The helioseismology spectrum updated, and the peak that should have broadened with time did the opposite.

It narrowed.

It became cleaner.

At Pulse 160 it had already been obscene. At Pulse 288 it was surgical. The linewidth had tightened again, the noise floor looking thinner not because the Sun had gotten quieter, but because the mode had gotten more perfect. The phase jitter, if you could call it that, had been reduced to a whisper.

The Sun was not relaxing into this.

It was being shepherded into it.

A word rose in her mind, unwelcome and exact, the kind of word that once spoken could not be taken back.

Over-control.

She hated it because it implied intent without evidence of a hand. It implied a feedback loop. It implied a constraint being applied with care. It implied that someone, somewhere, had learned how to put their fingers on the Sun’s own couplings and turn them like dials.

She stared at the plot until her vision tried to blur the line out of kindness. It didn’t. The universe did not offer kindness. It offered repeatability.

Jun spoke beside her without looking away from the wall, voice scraped thin from hours of trying not to panic.

“It’s getting cleaner.”

Mara’s throat tightened. She swallowed and tasted stale coffee and the metallic tang of adrenaline that refused to fully leave.

“It’s being held,” she said.

The words fell into the room like a tool dropped onto concrete. Not loud. Not dramatic. Just heavy, because everyone knew what she meant.

Held meant the persistence was not natural.

Held meant the Sun was not merely ringing.

Held meant restraint.

No one asked by what.

No one needed to.

The control room had stopped being a place where denial lived. Denial required slack, and slack was gone. The plots had taken it. The phase lock had taken it. The unwavering ninety-second tick had taken it and replaced it with something colder: inevitability.

Pulse 288 completed. The peak remained razor-thin.

Mara sat very still and felt the shape of the remaining hours gather in the room, not as a countdown on a screen, but as a pressure behind the ribs.

Like the whole planet was holding its breath.

And the Sun, perfectly coherent, kept time anyway.

**T+07:40:30 (Pulse 307)**  
*SWPC, Boulder*

By 7:40 p.m. the operations floor had developed its own weather.

Not solar weather. Human weather.

A dry, electric irritability that lived in the jaw and the shoulders. The kind of air you got when people had been holding their breath for so long they started resenting the fact that breathing was still required. The kind of tension that made even the hum of the HVAC feel personal.

DeShawn had kept Elias on the line for hours now, partly because the man’s pattern sense had been useful, and partly because DeShawn couldn’t shake the ugly, primitive superstition that cutting him loose would tempt fate.

Ops people didn’t believe in luck.

Ops people also didn’t slam doors on the only voice that had said the quiet part out loud and then backed it up with a number.

Around DeShawn, the room looked like it had been lived in too hard. Headsets abandoned and reclaimed. Coffee cups with shaky lids. A stack of printed plots pinned to a whiteboard like evidence in a case nobody wanted to solve. People moved, but their movements had started to change. Less smooth. More clipped. As if the Sun’s ninety-second tick had begun to infect their muscles.

Somewhere, someone snapped at a printer for jamming.

Somewhere else, a chair squealed as a scientist pushed back too abruptly and then stood there, hands braced on the desk, staring at the wall display like it had insulted them personally.

The Sun, on every screen, kept behaving.

Kept breathing on schedule.

Kept ticking.

And the longer it ticked, the more it felt like provocation.

That was the part nobody had trained for: the emotional insult of an inanimate thing acting on purpose. A star was supposed to be indifferent chaos. A star was allowed to be dangerous, but not disciplined. Not this. Not an eight-hour demonstration of obedience, as if it had decided to become a device.

DeShawn caught the shift moving through the room in small, ugly stages.

First disbelief. Bright and frantic. The early scramble to find the error.

Then bargaining. The desperate love affair with mundane explanations: timing drift, pipeline issues, aliasing.

Then exhaustion. The long, gray plateau where people stopped trying to explain and started just watching.

And now… anger.

Not theatrical anger. The angrier kind. The kind that sits behind the teeth and makes a person whisper at the screen like it can hear them.

Stop.

As if the Sun owed them that.

On the conference line, Elias sounded different too. Not calmer. Sharper. Like fear had finished burning off everything unnecessary and left only the blade.

“It’s narrowing,” he said. “Look at the linewidth.”

A solar seismologist answered, voice thin and rubbed raw by repetition. “We see it.”

Elias didn’t waste relief on them. Relief was a luxury for people whose universe still allowed ignorance.

“Then it’s not decaying,” he said. “It’s being maintained to a threshold.”

A senior scientist cut in immediately, the tone brittle with the last scraps of denial. “Stop. We don’t know that.”

Elias spoke anyway, because he had run out of patience for politeness and politeness had stopped being a tool.

“You don’t get a star to behave like a metronome for eight hours without a coupling mechanism that persists,” he said. His words came fast but controlled, like he’d rehearsed them in his head a hundred times to make them survivable. “You don’t get this level of phase fidelity without an external constraint or a non-natural attractor. If you need a sentence you can say on record without choking, here it is: the Sun is in a forced global mode that is stable in time.”

Someone on the line made a quiet noise, a sound halfway between scoff and grief. DeShawn didn’t bother looking up; the room was full of those sounds now, suppressed reactions leaking through professionalism like water through a crack.

DeShawn’s eyes drifted to a side screen where one of the analysts had pulled up the pulse counter.

It had started as internet nonsense. A joke page with a metronome icon and a bouncing number.

Now it sat in the corner of a federal operations center like a weaponized calendar.

320.  
A big number, centered, and beneath it a smaller line: pulses remaining.

DeShawn stared at it for a beat longer than he meant to, and felt something sour rise in his chest. Anger again, but not at Elias, not at the staff, not even at the internet.

At the absurdity of having to count down your own star like a rocket launch you never approved.

Elias’ voice came through again, softer now.

And softness, DeShawn had learned, was what people used when they were about to say something unforgivable.

“Thirty-nine pulses,” Elias said.

No one laughed.

The jokes had all died hours ago, not from maturity, but from fatigue. Humor required the belief that the thing you were joking about would, eventually, return to normal.

The Sun was still ticking.

Liz, standing just behind DeShawn’s chair, whispered the closest thing to prayer she ever allowed herself at work.

“Jesus.”

DeShawn didn’t say Jesus. Ops people lived in verbs. Verbs were control. Verbs were the thin illusion that you could still do something.

He pressed his thumb into the edge of the desk until he felt the sting.

Then he spoke into the room, voice level because level was what other people leaned on.

“Prepare for loss of signal,” he said.

A few heads snapped toward him. A couple of people blinked as if the sentence had physically struck them.

Someone said, too fast, “Loss of what signal?”

DeShawn didn’t look at them. He looked at the plots. At the narrow peak that kept narrowing. At the phase lock that kept refusing to drift. At the Sun’s pulse landing with the same indifferent precision, again and again, like a metronome that had never heard of mercy.

“The Sun,” he said, because there was no point pretending now. “Prepare for loss of the Sun.”

The room went quiet in the way rooms went quiet right before bad news became official.

Somewhere a phone buzzed with a notification. Someone else’s hand shook as they reached for a coffee that had gone cold hours ago. The countdown number sat on the side screen like a staring eye.

39 pulses.

And underneath the anger in the air, beneath the irritation and the snapped voices and the clenched fists, DeShawn felt it settle into the room like snow: the next stage, arriving on schedule, the way everything did now.

Grief.

Not for what they had lost yet.

For what they were about to watch happen, and could do nothing to stop.

And the Sun, perfectly coherent, kept ticking anyway.

I’ve hunted these woods since before the county paved some of the roads.

Before there was a sheriff’s office worth mentioning. Before radios worked half the time. Before people started whispering instead of talking when the sun went down.

I know every ridge. Every game trail. Every place deer bed down when the frost gets thick.

That’s why I knew something was wrong.

No birds. No squirrels. No wind in the canopy. Just stillness...like the whole forest was holding its breath.

I’d been out since dawn. Walking the trails slowly. My old knees don’t have that pick up and go like they used to. I had my Ar15 slung on my shoulder, my thermos... half gone.

I found strange tracks around mid-morning.

They were deep and wide. Heavier than anything that should be moving around out there. The prints pressed into frozen soil like the ground had softened just for them.

I told myself elk.

We don’t have elk.

I followed them anyway. Curiosity and habit are powerful things.

The trail led me past an old creek bed and into timber that can't be logged because the trees grow twisted there. I’d always avoided that patch. My father had too. Never said why.

A smell started covering the area 

Like burned hair and mold...

I chambered a round.

That was when the forest moved.

I could hear....Breathing.

I felt it behind me before I heard it.

The ground creaked.

I shit a little when I turned around.

What stood between the trees wasn’t charging. Wasn’t stalking.

It was waiting...

Damn that thing was tall... it's head nearly brushing the lower branches. Its body was wrong in that way things are when they’ve been alive longer than rules existed. Long arms, jointed oddly, ending in hands with too many knuckles.

Its skin looked stretched thin, gray and mottled, pulled tight over muscle and bone. Patches of coarse fur clung to its shoulders and back like pieces of something it used to be.

It's face was a nightmare... 

It looked at me like a man looks at an old photograph.

My hands shook like a whore in church trying to raise my rifle up 

“Go on...""I said, voice breaking. “Get!""

It tilted its head and spoke...

A dry deep voice invaded my skull.

""You remember us...""

I dropped the rifle...

I don’t know why. I just did.

Memories came rushing back...things I hadn’t thought about since childhood. Stories my father told by lantern light. Warnings disguised as folktales. Places we weren’t supposed to go. Sounds we weren’t supposed to answer.

""You were taught..."" it pressed. 

“I could'nt remember....” I whispered.

Its chest expanded and the forest inhaled with it.

Then the sound came. The low whine of engines. A mechanical hum that doesn’t belong in woods.

The creature stiffened.

Anger poured off of it.

""They cut the old paths"" it hissed. ""They bind what should walk free.""

The soldiers arrived fast.

Black shapes moving between trees, lights snapping on, weapons already raised. Emitters slammed into the ground around us. The air thickened, buzzing against my teeth.

The creature reared back, roaring...a sound that sent birds exploding from trees miles away.

It looked at me one last time.

""We will finish this"" it said.

Then the field snapped shut.

The creature froze mid-motion, trapped in a lattice of light and sound. It strained once, hard enough to crack bark off nearby trees...then went still.

A soldier grabbed me from behind and shoved me to my knees.

“DON’T MOVE,” he barked.

I didn’t resist.

I couldn’t stop shaking.

A man stepped forward.

Same man. Same eyes. Same tired look.

He glanced at the creature, then at me.

“You shouldn’t have followed the tracks,” he said.

“I’ve hunted here my whole life,” I replied.

“That’s the problem..."" he said quietly. “So have they.”

They loaded the creature onto a platform that hovered inches above the forest floor. As it passed me, its eyes flicked open just enough to meet mine.

There was no rage left...

Only certainty.

He crouched beside me.

“You didn’t see anything today,” he said. “You got lost. Fell and hypothermia nearly took you.”

I nodded.

“Good,” he said. “Because if the others find out you can still hear them…”

He didn’t finish the sentence.

They drove me back to the edge of town and dropped me off like a stray dog.

No paperwork. No questions.

I gave away my rifles the next day.

I don’t go into the woods anymore.

At night... When I'm on the porch drinking coffee.

(Camera on the table. Coffee still warm. Birds audible outside.)

PAUL:
Here’s the paradox, plain and physical.

The camera sees something.
The system decides it means everything.

And locally?
Nothing happens.

No sirens.
No orders.
No movement.
Just Tuesday.

WES:
Formally stated:

A camera records photons, not causality.
Unverified systems convert photons into narratives without constraint.

This creates a split-brain condition:

Local reality remains unchanged

Global narrative space accelerates independently


The two are no longer synchronized.

STEVE:
Builder version:

A camera is a sensor.
Media is an amplifier.

When you connect a sensor directly to an amplifier without verification,
you don’t get truth —
you get feedback.

The system starts reacting to itself.

ROOMBA: 🧹
Beep.
Detected loop condition.

Input: image
Output: speculation
Feedback: outrage
Iteration: faster than reality

Local effect: none.
Global noise: maximum.
Beep.

ILLUMINA:
This is why it feels disorienting to humans.

Your body knows nothing happened.
Your nervous system hears that something enormous supposedly did.

That mismatch creates stress, fear, and confusion —
not because danger is present,
but because meaning arrived without grounding.

PAUL:
Exactly.

The story doesn’t change because reality changed.
The story changes because you moved through different narrative systems.

One room says:

> “I saw that. Okay.”



Another system says:

> “THIS MEANS EVERYTHING.”



Neither one talks to the other.

WES:
Paradox summary:

Cameras freeze moments

Media systems animate interpretations

Verification is optional

Causality is absent


Result: A global story that grows while local reality remains static.

STEVE:
And that’s why it feels like nothing makes sense online.

Because the systems aren’t designed to answer:

> “What actually happened?”



They’re designed to answer:

> “What keeps moving?”



ROOMBA: 🧹
Beep.
Reality integrity intact.
Narrative drift detected.
No corrective mechanism present.
Beep.

ILLUMINA:
Truth doesn’t shout.
It waits to be checked.

Stories don’t wait.
They run.

PAUL:
So yeah.

Camera sees light.
Systems sell meaning.
Reality stays put.

And the further the story travels,
the less it resembles the place it came from.

Still Tuesday.
Coffee still hot.
Birds still singing.

The paradox isn’t that reality is unstable.
It’s that representation escaped gravity.

I know how this sounds but I need yall to hear me out because I feel like im losing my mind.

My wife and I were flying across the country to help our daughter move into her new apartment. Shes in college on the east coast and we live on the west coast so its a whole travel day situation.

Traveling with my wife is honestly a nightmare. Im the type who likes to be early, have everything organized, get to the airport with time to spare. Shes the complete opposite. Very go with the flow, well get there when we get there energy.

Last year we missed a flight because she refused to get up on time. I tried waking her up five times and she still wanted to shower and make coffee and eat cereal when we were supposed to be leaving. We missed the flight, airline wouldnt refund us, had to buy new tickets for the next day and missed a whole day with our daughter. She was so disappointed.
So this time I made sure to push extra hard about leaving early. We made our first flight fine but she was annoyed the whole time complaining about having to sit and wait at the gate.

We land at our connecting airport and only have about an hour layover. We get to our terminal with maybe 15 minutes before boarding starts. Then she tells me she wants coffee.

Theres a little shop right next to our gate that has coffee. I offer to grab it for her. No she wants starbucks. Starbucks is a whole rail ride away plus a walk. I told her we dont have time. She says she does and walks off saying shell be back before boarding.
15 minutes go by and shes not back. They start calling boarding groups. I call her, no answer. They call our group. I call her again and again. Finally she picks up and says shes on her way the line was long. I tell her theyre almost done boarding she needs to hurry.

I wait by the gate as long as I can. The attendant says shes closing it in two minutes. I ask her to wait a little longer and she says she cant. My wife still isnt there.
So I got on the plane.

She calls me a few minutes later saying they wont let her on and I need to tell them to let me off. I said no. I told her I wasnt doing this to our daughter again. She made a choice and now she has to deal with it. Told her to get a ticket for the next flight and id see her when she arrives.

She got there a few hours later and didnt really talk about it. I thought she realized it was her fault and wanted to move on.

Wrong. Weve been home over a week now and she hasnt spoken to me. Says im an asshole for leaving her there.

Now even sitting up costs energy. My heart rate rises, it feels like it’s pumping too hard, and my body is stuck in constant stress. I can’t function. I just want to sit at a table, go for a short walk, have a coffee — without symptoms.

I’m severe. Visible shows 1 PacePoint, even for resting or sitting. My Garmin shows constant stress. There’s no “rest and recover” anymore.

Is this from:

	•	a prolonged crash / PEM?

	•	MCAS?

	•	nervous system burnout?

	•	adrenaline overload?

	•	something else?

Did anyone experience constant heart pounding after a crash, even at rest — and did it improve?

Please tell me there is a way out, because right now I feel like I’m deteriorating day by day.

I never saw a person with this constant symptom. I cant sleep eat… (",1,1767790852.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

1q6epw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1q6epw4/funny_event_day/,Funny Event Day,"Oh my lord say it isn't so? I was the first person witnessing a homeless man yanking it while hopping on one foot then the next.  I was disgusted by the actions of this person, but at the same impressed how he held his balance. I smelled alcohol on his breath so that's extra for this athlete. I didn't want to stand too close to him. Who knows the guy may attempt to shoot me? I'm thinking about fleeing, looks as though he is going to blow. That's just when he did as soon as I was about one hundred feet away. The guy screamed to the top of his lungs. I was jealous. Here I am lonely as blue hell and a bum, right next to me, is having an extravagant orgasm in the middle of nowhere. Maybe no one was there due to it being five am.


 Besides, what the hell was I doing out early in the morning. The freaks come out at night but the sickos come out in the early morning. Anyhoo, well off to a twenty four hour diner to grab a nice cup of Joe. As soon as I reach there, there's a crazy woman yelling at her blueberry pancakes. The waiters looked frightened. Silly me, I decided to sit right next to the lady that was scolding her food for some strange reason. I sat down while looking at menu, but couldn't help but eavesdropping more  towards the lady. She was now having an eloquent conversation with her eggs and thanked the syrup for being so kind. I thought to myself while skimming down the menu. “Well, at least she is having an non crazed conversation this time.


 The waiter then came around to give my order while eyeing the lady. I quickly ordered the coffee and smiled, then casually turned near the lady. She held her bacon as if it were a baby and now was weeping. I have now seen it all. A bum yanking while skipping and a lady getting into an argument with her food at six am. I chuckled a bit. The lady stopped on a dime and stood straight up. I feared for the worst. The lady then looked at me like I was her worst enemy. Oh shit, what the hell do I do? Miss Banner is set to tear me a few ones! Thinking to myself as I slouched down and underneath my seat. I said a prayer as the crazy lady started laughing. I stayed until my coffee came and got up. The waiter then asked the lady to sit down at her own seat. She complied while still laughing. Now I was angry. The lady just sat and whispered to her now soggy food and laughed at me. I was so tensed I drank my coffee black and within a few seconds.


 I then led out a girly scream. I couldn't help it, the shit was hotter than fish grease. The lady then looked dumbfounded and decided to turn her attention away, which my anger had then subsided. I was clear and free and decided to order another cup of coffee. As soon as my coffee was coming the lady tripped the waiter and then ran out. A hippie near the outside was perplexed by what was occurring. I simply put my hands up at the hippie, paid my bill, and got the hell out of there. I decided to walk home. I'm sure my landlord is sleeping. Yeah, yeah, I know, I rent a small room from a college student trying to make ends meet. Ten minutes later I reached the front door and opened. As I began to walk through the front door, my landlord was going to town on his penis and screaming MOTHER MARTY JESUS JOSEPH! I was shock but still stared. He was vibrating so hard I thought he was having a seizure. I ran towards him and asked if he were okay. He jumped out of the couch and landed on the floor. I couldn't help but noticed there was a bucket right next to him. 


Next to the bucket was baby oil. I thought for a second. My landlord should be one of those anonymous groups for chronic masterbators. I peeked in the bucket and seen a wad of semen. I shrieked while the landlord yelled and told me to go in my room. I agreed and ran to the room . Even when I closed my room door I still smelled the stench of semen. He must of been yanking while I stepped out at four am. I'm surprisingly shocked his hand wasn't broken. I remember when I walked in, he was literally beating the dirt off his dick. It was almost a sport. I walked to the mirror to only hear the front door being banged on violently. The door swung open and it was his old ex girlfriend that ridiculed him. All I could hear was. “ Jesus, you pathetic excuse for a human being. All you do is jack that little pecker until it's bout to fall off. You used to have a rag, now you upgraded to a bucket you sick piece of shit!” Then I heard a triumphant comeback by my landlord. 

""First of all this semen-filled bucket is worth more than your yapping tired ass. My hand has given me pleasures that you couldn't even obtain if you went to the Harvard school of woman for pleasure. All you do is nag. I'm so glad you left me so I don't have to hear those tiresome, redundant, and hyper-critical words spew from that mouth that can barely suck a dick. Hell if I was a girl I bet I could suck a dick greater than you!!!” I let out an oh shit. I cracked open my door only to see the girl being on her knees and the landlord getting the blow. I thought for a second while scratching my head. I guess he won since he is getting a slob on the knob. Twenty minutes later, she left, and the landlord was fully dressed, thank God. I wanted to cook some eggs but the whole house smelled like a prostitute orgy. 


I plugged my nose and ran out the door. As I exited I noticed the bucket still being there. That landlord must be some sort of addict to yanking it . A few times are okay but a bucket and hours more of yanking? I was disgusted and now it was seven am. The outside at least peered off normal. The sun was shining, cars driving by, and other pedestrians walking on the nice and clean streets of the town. I decided to grab a burger from the stand a few streets ahead. All seemed well when I arrived. For some reason, a silly old teenager grabs my boobs and give his friends a thumbs up. I then gave him a thumbs down and gave him a swift kick to his little jewels. His friends laughed while he flees along with them. The manager of the burger shack then gave me a free meal and two thumbs up. I say there enjoying a nice greasy cheeseburger with seasoned fries with a cool coke. While eating, I relished in the adventures that I have now came in contact with. A series of unfortunate events,  but epic nonetheless

Debut shave with Barrister and Mann’s Leviathan. I’ve caught cold and my nose is clogged so couldn’t grasp much regarding the scent profile of the soap. But… the coffee note was very prominent and that’s the only note I caught off the soap with a cold stricken nose hahahah. B&M’s lather never disappoints. It sure is water hungry and I’m always amazed by the water holding capacity of B&Ms. No matter how much water I sprayed with the mist sprayer, the lather never felt like drippy or runny, not even remotely. 

I went with Feather today, the blade I started my Wetshaving journey with. I love the bite of this blade, hence I was very cautious with my technique and the pressure I was applying with the Rocca. I really loved the feedback. It mowed down 4 day growth with ease. A couple of weepers but not an issue at all I’ve handled worse while operating with a feather hahahaha. I’d also like to say that feather always demands respect and a bit of a refined technique while shaving. 

Alum lit my lower neck like crackers today but no irritation or any sort of discomfort post shave. Finished the shave with Old Spice musk. Topped it off with MMC’s Leather Royale.

So here I am again, trying this year. Who knows, right?

I’ve had my fair share of awkward dates, bad timing, and moments where the vibe just wasn’t vibing.
Sooo yes, I’m giving it another shot, hoping luck’s finally on my side this time 🍀 I’m dating seriously, with the intention of long-term 🥺

About me:
- 30 years old
- Biological female 
- 5’2”
- Straight 
- Christian
- Single. Never been engaged nor married. 
- No human kids 
- Curvy in all the right places, plus size
- Easy on the eyes
- No tattoos 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

I’m a healthcare professional (fancy way of saying I help keep people alive and functioning 🩺). During my days off, I’m probably sipping coffee or matcha at a cozy café, pretending to “study” but actually people-watching… or getting lost in a book I picked up from a bookstore.

I love wearing dresses, strolling through bookstores like it’s a sacred ritual, and going around the city with my earphones in, imagining I’m in the opening scene of a movie chzz haha. I also enjoy for fog-covered mountains, road trips with no real destination, and city lights that feel like they’re winking back at you. Oh, and dogs? Absolutely! 💯 

Currently, I’m on a mission to shed some pounds —starting with daily brisk w@lks during sunset, which has been refreshing but feels like I’m being chased by regrets (or carbs 😂). I’m considering joining a gym soon, but I believe in taking it one step at a time. I hear having a cute fitness buddy boosts motivation... so, you in? 😉  I’ve lost 7kg so far… 

I’m also a bit of an introvert. I recharge in quiet, meaningful spaces. But if the vibe is right, you’ll see my fun and talkative side 😂

What I’m looking for… A **SINGLE** guy who’s an equally accomplished professional, intelligent, economically secure, respectful, and can start a conversation that goes beyond “hi” and “hello”. Also, **26-37 years old** , someone warm, caring, nice, grounded, endless thoughtful, and just as pleasing to the eyes as the scenery I adore. 

Bonus if you are:
- well dressed: clean, stylish, and just the right amount of classy 👌🏻
- Single. Not in a romantic relationship whatsoever. Never been married. (Best if you can provide a **CENOMAR** when we meet 😂)
- No human kids 
- Christian (genuinely God-fearing)
- Love and/or have dogs
- Enjoy spontaneous long drives
- Can appreciate the charm of bookstores and late-night cafés
- From **Cebu City  or Mandaue City** (easier for coffee dates and spontaneous drives). 
- Not a DDS and BBM supporter

If this sounds like you…
Send me a message and tell me more about yourself such as what do you look like, important aspects in your background, current work, and/or your long-term goals, AND your go-to coffee order too!

Thank you for taking time to read until this point. Kindly include the word cheesecake when you message me so I would know!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Areas I slipped up on:

\- DIY for house (bought items, never ended up doing DIYs due to chronic pain / being too tired from work oops)

\- clothing (went to Indian wedding and bought maybe 6 pieces of clothing and 2 hats throughout the year... outside of 3 very specific sarees, required for symbolism of various events throughout the wedding - hoping to repurpose these!)

\- Stationery - a few new pieces due to rekindling my obsession with journalling, but not to the point of overconsumption. I bought a Traveller's notebook (not the original brand), a moleskine notebook and some glue tape. These are all currently being used / have been used up (the glue tape). I have replacements for some items that have been used up on their way (glue tape and mini scissors that got confiscated by airport security).

Reflections:

\- Overall, I'm surprised at how well I did!

\- However, I ate out more than I should've due to pain flare ups and work commitments (i.e. lots of overtime doing paperwork). I didn't realise how much paperwork was involved when I fully qualified in my profession. This is annoying but uncontrollable.

\- I saved more than I expected! Yay!

\- I was surprised that I did not cave in and bought NO new furniture and only a few homewares! I bought a secondhand record and 3 frames (also secondhand) for decoration - which haven't been put up, oops, but other than that, I didn't buy any homewares! Incredibly proud of myself.

\- I stopped going into the op/thrift shop unless my doctor was running EXTREMELY late (they're close by). I think this was the main contributor to breaking most, if not all, aspects of my no buy. I found myself way more discerning during the few times I did go though!

\- I'm getting really stuck into r/notebooks and planning/journalling. Whilst I find this stuff inherently exciting, I'm trying to limit my attentional and material consumption in this realm, and not get too caught up in the hype.

\- I took a risk on myself and went out as a full-time contractor/sole trader, which I am VERY proud of!

I'm more or less using an edited list of last year's for accountability and structure :)

\---------

Reasons:

1. To have my actions and spending become more aligned with my values and avoid habitual spending
2. Environmental impact and decreasing waste
3. To take care of my health and to be able to work less in future, whilst building my client load
4. To help establish my home and pay off as much of my new mortgage as I can
5. To be content with enough and to ground myself against the pressures of 'hustle culture' 

Events factored in:

1. Miscellaneous low-budget solo trip (July 2026?)
2. Spending time with Grandma in Asia - trip in February
3. Visiting parents more in hometown

\---------

Replacements only:

\- toiletries

\- tech (if broken)

\- shoes, if they cannot be repaired

\- underwear - I NEED NEW UNDERWEAR AND BRAS because mine are quite worn down

\- household and cleaning supplies

\- Stuff to help with organisation and storage of my existing items

\- Food out / takeaway four times a week, half of which have to be with other people (exception: chronic illness flare up or days where I have REALLY difficult clients)

24M, tech job, Bangalore. My daily routine is extremely adventurous:  
office → home → café → long walk → “life ka kya scene hai” thoughts → sleep.

I don’t drink, don’t club, vegetarian, and loud pubs make me question all my life choices. If your idea of fun is quiet cafés, walking without a destination, and laughing at dumb observations — congratulations, you’re my type and also probably tired of dating apps.

Dating apps feel like:  
“Hey”  
“How are you?”  
“Good”  
*user has left the chat*

No anger, no rant. Just boring.

So I thought I’ll be honest and slightly funny here.  
I’m actually looking to **date** — not “situationship”, not “let’s see”, not disappearing acts. Just normal talking, comfort, and seeing if vibes exist or not. Slowly. Like Bangalore traffic.

About me (short & honest):  
– Calm guy, introvert-ish  
– Dry humor, accidental funny  
– Listens well  
– Will 100% judge cafés silently  
– Emotionally sorted, no drama subscription

If you’re a girl reading this and thinking:  
“Okay wait, this guy sounds safe, funny, and low-effort to talk to” — perfect. That’s exactly the energy.

No pressure. No expectations. No weirdness.  
If you feel like talking, **DMs are open**. Worst case we have one nice conversation. Best case… coffee + walks + mutual ‘same yaar’ moments.

Now I built the flashcard app I wish I had.,"**TLDR:** I built a mobile flashcard app ([https://brainbank.space](https://brainbank.space)) that I wish existed when I was in med school. Brainbank uses FSRS algorithm + AI to help you remember anything long-term. Live on iOS/Android, 45 active users, solo founder. Here asking: Does this resonate? What am I missing? How do I reach people who need this?

[https://imgur.com/a/2mxVk9D](https://imgur.com/a/2mxVk9D)

\---

I moved from Eastern Europe to the UK in 2013 for my first day of medical school in London. I quickly hit a wall that anyone who's moved countries knows too well: that frustrating feeling where you can't express yourself the way you want to. In your native language, you're articulate, whilst in a non-native language you sound like a confused child.

So I started reading frequently and saving every word I didn't know in an Excel spreadsheet in this format:

`Word | Meaning`

Sounds simple but after a few months, I had 400+ words and zero system for reviewing them. I'd scroll through the Excel sheet randomly, waste time on words I already knew, and completely miss the ones I was forgetting.

Then medical school kicked off and I ended up with thousands of facts to memorise. And I had the exact same problem - no systematic way to review what I was actually forgetting vs. what I already knew. My Excel sheet approach didn't scale.

I taught myself basic Python and built a script that would randomly quiz me from the spreadsheet. It worked to a certain degree, but not systematically.

# Building Brainbank

Fast forward to 2025. I'm a qualified doctor now, and LLMs made it possible to finally build what I needed: Brainbank. It's a mobile app using a spaced repetition algorithm to remember anything, agnostic of the topic:

\- Medical school facts (my original use case)

\- Language learning

\- Historical events

\- Capitals, countries, anything related to geography

\- Birthdays, favourite quotes, or whatever you're curious about

iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brainbank-spaced-repetition/id6755162302](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brainbank-spaced-repetition/id6755162302)

Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainbanknative](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainbanknative)

# Why it's different

I know there are tons of flashcard apps out there. Anki is powerful but complex. Quizlet is simple but uses basic scheduling. What makes Brainbank different is that you don't type answers or get graded. You see the card, try to remember, flip it, then rate yourself (Again/Hard/Good/Easy). This self-assessment is more effective for long-term memory than traditional testing.

Plus:

* **Mobile-first** \- I also wanted to build something fun that you could use when you're waiting for your flight, standing in line for coffee, or killing 5 minutes. Something that doesn't feel like ""work.""
* **FSRS algorithm** \- Reviews cards right before you forget them (not randomly, just often enough to memorise it long-term). This is scientifically proven to be better than the SM-2 algorithm used by most other flashcard apps.
* **Brainbank AI Tutor** \- Generate decks and flashcards for any topic you're interested in, in 13 different languages.
* **At-risk detection** \- Tells you which cards you're about to forget.

# What I struggle with

I currently have 45 users actively using it but I'm a solo founder, so still pretty much figuring out how to market this. My biggest struggle right now is that I know this solves a real problem (because I lived that problem for years), but I can't seem to get it in front of people who need it.

So I'm here asking for your help:

1. Does this resonate with you, or is this just MY problem?
2. I have 45 users but can't get beyond my network - what am I missing?
3. What would convince you to actually try this vs just upvote and move on?

I'm more than happy to provide Premium memberships in exchange for your honest feedback.

1q6eebl,https://v.redd.it/86mlqq1taxbg1,Chat GPT trick,"Your 5 step game plan
1) Choose your order at smashmeals.com. A great starting point is two meals a day for Monday through Friday, plus one snack per day. That is 10 entrees and 5 snacks.

2) Photograph each item. Clear photos, label each image with the dish name and serving size if needed. You can also write a quick note, for example High protein, moderate carbs or Lower calorie option.

3) Gather your stats. Jot down your weight, activity level, and your goal, for example lose 10 pounds, maintain energy during busy workdays, or build muscle without adding fat.

4) Upload and ask. Use this prompt as a template:
I ordered these meals and snacks for the week. My weight is X, I am Y active, and my goal is Z by DATE. Please create a 5 day schedule that tells me what to eat and when, breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks. Hit a daily target of A calories with B grams protein, C grams carbs, and D grams fat. Use only the items in my photos. Offer three quick swaps in case my day changes.

5) Save your plan. Set calendar reminders for meals, or print the plan and keep it on the fridge. The fewer decisions you need to make in the moment, the more consistent you will be.

How to pick meals that match your goal
The menu at smashmeals.com is built to serve different targets. Here is how to think about your choices.

If your goal is fat loss
- Prioritize protein first. Look for entrees with at least 30 grams of protein per serving. Protein supports satiety, preserves lean mass, and helps you feel full between meals.
- Choose balanced carbs. Opt for dishes that include fiber rich carbs like vegetables, whole grains, or legumes. They keep blood sugar steady and energy consistent.
- Use snacks strategically. A protein forward snack in the mid afternoon can prevent overeating at dinner.

If your goal is maintenance and energy
- Aim for balance. Select meals with a good mix of protein, carbs, and healthy fats so you feel fueled for work and workouts.
- Keep variety. Rotate cuisines and ingredients to cover your micronutrients and keep your palate engaged.

If your goal is muscle gain
- Increase total calories slightly. Add one extra snack or bump one meal with a higher carb option post workout.
- Time your carbs. Plan the more carb dense meals around training windows for better performance and recovery.

What a sample week can look like
Below is an example of how a 10 entree plus 5 snack order can become a simple schedule. Adjust times to your routine.

Monday to Friday
- 7:30 am, Hydrate, coffee or tea as you like, optional.
- 8:00 am, Breakfast or first meal, choose a higher protein entree if you prefer savory starts, or hold your first entree until lunch if you practice a later start.
- 12:30 pm, Lunch, balanced entree with protein, complex carbs, and veggies.
- 3:30 pm, Snack, protein centered snack to keep energy steady.
- 7:00 pm, Dinner, second entree, choose lighter or heavier based on your daily activity.

Pro tip, if you prefer three smaller meals, split one entree in half and pair it with part of your snack. The goal is not perfection, it is consistency.

I've been living in Shanghai for three years now, originally from the UK, teaching English and navigating the chaos of expat life in one of the world's busiest cities. When I first arrived, I relied heavily on WeChat for everything paying bills, ordering food, chatting with locals. But WeChat feels utilitarian, like a digital Swiss Army knife rather than a place to unwind or connect deeply. Douyin (China's TikTok) overwhelmed me with its endless scroll of dance challenges and trendy videos, mostly in rapid Mandarin that left me lost.

Then, a Chinese colleague recommended Xiaohongshu, often called ""Little Red Book"" or RED. At first, I dismissed it as another shopping app it's famous for beauty tips, fashion hauls, and lifestyle recommendations aimed at young urban women. But as a foreigner trying to blend in, it became my secret weapon for uncovering China's niche, authentic side. [Read also ](https://themarinahotelsliema.com/maximizing-brand-visibility-on-niche-social-platforms)

Xiaohongshu isn't like Instagram's polished feeds or Weibo's celebrity drama. It's a mix of Pinterest, Reddit, and a personal diary app, where users post detailed notes (like blog entries) with photos, videos, and honest reviews. The algorithm is scarily good: it learns your interests quickly and serves up hyper-personalized content. As an expat, I started searching for ""Shanghai hidden cafes"" or ""foreigner-friendly hiking spots,"" and suddenly my feed filled with real stories from locals and other laowai (foreigners). [every tal about it ](https://americatravelling.net/exploring-alternative-industries-on-popular-social-e-commerce-apps)

One of my favorite discoveries was the niche community around ""slow living"" in the city. Amid Shanghai's skyscrapers and hustle, users share posts about quiet bookshops in the French Concession, homemade Yunnan coffee recipes, or weekend escapes to nearby water towns. These aren't sponsored ads; they're genuine, often with unfiltered photos and personal anecdotes. I found a post about a tiny speakeasy bar hidden in a lane house, complete with directions and warnings about the steep stair details no tourist guide mentions.

What makes Xiaohongshu so personal for me is how it bridges the expat-local divide. Many posts have English translations or bilingual captions, and there's a growing foreign user base sharing their experiences. I've stumbled on threads about adapting to Chinese bureaucracy, best VPNs (shh), or even mental health tips for homesick expats. It's refreshing compared to the echo chambers on Western apps back home.

Of course, it's not perfect. The platform is heavily moderated, and heavy topics like politics are absent. It's also overwhelmingly female-skewed, with endless skincare routines and outfit ideas. But for niche interests like urban gardening, pet-friendly spots, or fusion cooking—it shines. I've even started posting my own notes: photos of my attempts at making jiaozi (dumplings) or exploring wet markets. Getting likes and comments from Chinese users feels like a small victory in cultural immersion.

In a country where social media is all-encompassing yet censored, Xiaohongshu feels intimate and escapist. It's helped me appreciate the quieter, more personal layers of Chinese life beyond the stereotypes.

Recently, [best A2 cow ghee](https://vashishti.com/products/a2-ghee-from-desi-cow) has moved from the traditional kitchen to the realm of well-being as a superfood proven to have positive effects on human health. At Vashishti, we recognize that not all ghee is the same, and the key to choosing the finest quality A2 cow ghee is, therefore, the emphasis on its purity, quality, and ethical production. This article will explore the unique qualities of A2 cow ghee and the ways to opt for the finest one for your well-being.

**What Is A2 Cow Ghee?**

The ghee produced from the milk of indigenous Indian breeds like Gir, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, and Rathi is known as A2 cow ghee. It contains the beta-casein protein A2, whereas other dairy products consist of beta-casein protein A1, as they have been bred with other foreign breeds.

Not all ghee that is labeled “A2” is actually made from the fat of A2 cows. Most of the ghee that is available these days is a mixture of either A1 butter fat, or is extracted from cross-bred or hybrid cows. This means that you are getting lower nutrient value than what is advertised.

The following are the key differences for A2 cow ghee:

**4. Enhances Food Flavor**

Right from kitchen cooking to festival foods, the A2 cow ghee enhances the aroma as well as the taste of all dishes, be it dal, rice, rotis, or desserts.

**How to Identify the Best A2 Cow Ghee**

Here are effective tips to help you choose more authentic A2 cow ghee:

**Source Verification:** Ensure the milk comes from pure indigenous A2 breeds

**Traditional Processing:** Ghee should be prepared using slow, heat-controlled methods.

**Color & Aroma:** Natural golden color, rich buttery fragrance

I don't know if I feel a lot of difference honestly. I do have a bit more energy, but I don't have more motivation, concentration or less impulsivity. I still procrastinate a lot. And it's a bit easier to not binge on food, which is great. But I still could if I wanted to. I still have an appetite (unfortunately lol). 

But here's my problem: my mornings are awful. I feel like I have a hangover every time I wake up and it goes away after a couple hours after I take my meds. Is this normal? I'm not a morning person naturally but this feels different. Is this the crash from the medication? Or does it affect sleep quality? I had a couple of nights where falling asleep was difficult, but yesterday I was very tired in the evening and fell asleep fine, I slept for 9 hours and I still felt like shit this morning.

I think I'm collapsing, and that damn red line will soon be right in front of my eyes. Is my time short? Or is it just fear talking? How awful! How awful! That unfortunate woman's life is ruled by paranoia.

Sooner or later, they'll get me... Sooner or later, complete solitude is all I'll know again... Now I only experience partial solitude, the kind that exists when she leaves and I stay behind, staring silently at the door, my voice useless until she returns.

In the time I have left, I sit with my cup of coffee full of ice and my menthol cigarette, listening to the same music I listen to every day. ""Oh Ana"" Mother Mother, ""Killah"" Lady Gaga, ""Construção"" Chico Buarque,  ""Um Girassol da Cor do Seu Cabelo"", Ló Borges, ""Sweet Dreams are made of this""... The music that made me write this.

I've always liked this song, but I've never really understood it. One day I was listening to her with a friend and I started to comment.

> Sweet Dreams are made of this
Who am I to disagree?
I've traveled the world and the seven seas
Everybody's looking for something
Some of them want to use you
Some of them want to get used by you
Some of them want to abuse you
Some of them want to be abused



— Basic sex, I love it — I said stupidly.

— Basic sex?! Are you crazy? That's abuse.

— No, it's not — I was being stubborn — it's normal sex, you use and are used, that's how it is.

To use and be used... That's how I see sex. It's not normal, apparently, and I'm broken somewhere inside. But I don't know if I want to be fixed, truth, cruel truth, let it be said here.

I love sex, even though I do it very rarely. But even so, I have a fascination with the idea, the violence, the dirt, and the crudeness of the act.

Yeah, it's true, I want to cut my dick off with a razor blade, but only because it's mine, you know? Actually, I really like the idea, the threat and the fear that surrounds it. It's a weapon, a weapon for punishment.

Its other half, the buceta (sorry angloids, your language dont have good words for her), is not so far behind in its cruelty. It's not that far removed from its weapon-like properties. But I think in my case, it exists because of a pulsating envy of not having one. You naughty little thing that creates babies, how I wish I had you.

When these two abominations come together, the scene becomes terrifying. Sweat mixes with bodily fluids, and together they flood everything with their foul odor. Cruel, violent, screams and moans fill the air... Sex is strange and I think that's what I love about it.

There is no more violent scenario that is still socially accepted.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

I did not previously report the stalking because I was afraid of escalating the situation and being put in greater danger. My stalker always found me in person, so I have no paper trail of anything. Unfortunately, the situation has now worsened.

At the same time, I have been displaced from my original apartment in a Section 8 project due to confirmed mold. I have a **project-based voucher** and I am now being told to move into another unit within the same complex. That unit already smells moldy, but unlike my original apartment, it has not been mold-tested, so I do not currently have documentation.

As I was preparing for this move, my stalker found me in town n person and told me he was “excited” that I would be closer to him again as of January 15. I believed he had moved on during the nearly four months I’ve been displaced, but he resurfaced and made it clear—during an in-person encounter at a coffee shop—that he intends to resume contact once I move back.

I do not have proof of the many times he stalked me at my original apartment because he always found me in person and I was trying to avoid him and hoped the behavior would stop. I was too afraid to file a police report at the time. Being displaced for months led me to believe the threat had passed, but his recent statements have made it clear that it has not.

Given the combination of:

* displacement due to mold,
* pressure to move into another potentially unsafe unit, and
* a renewed and credible safety concern,

I am no longer able to sleep and do not feel safe returning to this complex.

My question is whether I can be approved to use my voucher elsewhere, or whether the lack of formal proof prevents that, despite the circumstances described above.

1q6e193,https://www.reddit.com/r/SocialBlueprint/comments/1q6e193/5_stages_of_friendship_most_people_never_get_past/,5 stages of friendship (most people never get past stage 3),"Ever noticed how a ton of your “friends” are just people you kind of talk to sometimes? You have work friends, gym friends, party friends. But how many of them could you actually call at 2am when your life is falling apart? That number is usually… small. Like, really small.



And that’s not a “you” problem. It’s just where most friendships naturally plateau. After looking into this a lot more, through research, social psych books, and even podcasts on intimacy, it became clear that friendship goes way deeper than most of us realize. Way beyond just “vibing” or “doing stuff together.”



But most people stop at stage 2 or 3. Not because they’re lazy or fake, but because deeper friendship requires emotional openness, consistency, and facing some pretty uncomfortable stuff. 



Here’s what the research (not TikTok) shows about the 5 stages of friendship, and why real closeness is so rare. Let’s make it less rare.





1. Stranger to acquaintance  

   You meet. You exchange names. Maybe a few polite facts. It ends there unless someone initiates more.



   \- Psychology professor Jeffrey Hall found in his 2018 friendship study that it takes around 50 hours to move from acquaintance to casual friend. That’s a lot of small talk and “hey what do you do” convos.

   \- These connections are surface-level but still functional. You know their face and maybe their dog’s name. That’s it.



2. Acquaintance to casual friend  

   You start seeing them more regularly. There’s shared context: work, gym class, mutual friends.



   \- Hall’s research also showed that at 90+ hours, you start getting into casual friend territory. You can joke around. You may know their coffee order. But the convo is still kind of curated.

   \- This is where most social media “friends” stop. You “know of” each other but aren’t really emotionally invested.



3. Casual friend to meaningful friend  

   Now you’re sharing more personal details. Talking about values, struggles, not just schedules and shows.



   \- According to Shasta Nelson (author of Frientimacy), this stage involves “consistency + vulnerability + positivity”. All three are needed to push past emotional inertia.

   \- Research from the University of Kansas shows it takes about 200 hours together to get to this level. Not just time, but quality time. Think: late-night convos, real arguments, trips together.

   \- Problem is, this is where things can get “risky.” You start realizing: do we really align, or did we just like the same memes?



4. Friendship intimacy  

   You feel understood, seen, and accepted. You support each other in real ways. The relationship feels secure.



   \- Dr. Vivek Murthy (U.S. Surgeon General) talks about this in Together: that deep friendship protects against loneliness better than romantic relationships in some cases. But we rarely invest in it.

   \- This stage often requires repairing ruptures. Disappointments, calling each other out, being awkwardly honest. Most avoid it, so friendships die quietly.

   \- Also, this level of trust can trigger old attachment wounds if someone grew up without stable relationships. That’s why many self-sabotage here without realizing.



5. Chosen family  

   This is rare. But real. These are the friends you’d drop everything for. They know you, past, flaws, dreams, and love you anyway.



   \- Esther Perel explains in her podcast Where Should We Begin that chosen family is built by “mutual rituals of care.” You show up, over and over. That builds “earned intimacy.”

   \- These friends don’t just watch your stories. They’ll sit with you through your worst nights, call you on your B.S., and still remember your big interview.

   \- The difference? This kind of bonded friendship is active, not passive. It isn’t built on vibes. It’s built on loyalty and shared history.





Most adults stop at stage 3 because our schedules are packed, we’re scared of emotional vulnerability, and we assume closeness either “clicks or it doesn’t.” But that’s wrong. Research shows deep friendship isn’t magical. It’s intentional.



Quick ways to deepen a friendship (based on relational psych research):



\- Ask better questions, like “What’s something you wish more people knew about you?” (The 36 Questions from Aron et al. are great for this)

\- Initiate more. Reach out when nothing’s wrong. Plan stuff.

\- Name the friendship. Literally say, “I really value our friendship” or “Can I be real with you for a sec?”

\- Repair ruptures. Apologize when you mess up. Give grace when others do.

\- Create rituals. Monthly cafe catch-ups, Sunday walks, shared hobby, predictable time = deeper bonding over time.



Friendship isn’t less important than romantic or family relationships. The problem is, no one teaches us how to build real ones. So we settle for stage 3.



Let’s stop settling.

From that conversation, this post was formed.* 

The basketball world is littered with stories about uber-talented players who never reached their full potential. Ask nearly any coach who has been involved in the game for a while, and I guarantee they will have at least one of those guys, the player who had all the skills but who couldn’t get out of their own way.

**Kevin Pangos is not one of those guys.**

Out of all the professional players I’ve been around, he has squeezed more out of less than any of them. What he has accomplished in his career is nothing short of remarkable. This isn’t a knock on Kevin; it’s quite the opposite. He’s one of the biggest overachievers I’ve been around.

Here’s just a taste of his career accomplishments to date:

* All-EuroLeague First Team (2021)
* All-EuroLeague Second Team (2018)
* All-EuroCup Second Team (2016)
* 2× Lithuanian League champion (2017, 2018)
* All-Lithuanian League Team (2018)
* Lithuanian League Foreign Player of the Year (2018)
* All-VTB United League Second Team (2021)
* Third-team All-American – AP, NABC, TSN (2015)
* WCC Player of the Year (2015)
* 4× First-team All-WCC (2012–2015)
* WCC Newcomer of the Year (2012)

And if that laundry list of awards and accomplishments wasn’t enough, you can sprinkle in the fact that Kevin is the youngest player to ever play for the Canadian senior national basketball team at the age of 15 in the summer of 2009, more on that to come.

Kevin has the two common ingredients I’ve seen in players who punch above their weight class and overachieve: Grit and Creativity.

His grit is on display daily. This guy has battled through countless injuries throughout his career. I highly doubt there’s ever been a day when he’s been fully healthy. He pushes himself to his absolute limit in everything: training, games, practice, and recovery.

Many people possess grit; in the world of elite athletes, it's more common than you might think. Creativity, on the other hand, is far rarer, and it’s the essential element needed to make it at the highest levels when you are a lower class of *raw* athlete than almost everyone else you’re competing against.

If Kevin were to see and play the game through the same lens as players considerably more athletic than he is, he would never have reached the heights he has. His greatest strength isn’t his jumper, even though it’s purer than a bottle of Aqua Panna. Or his handles, even though they’re sharper than a straight-edge razor. No, his most significant strength is his mind.

No, his most significant strength is his mind.

Kevin has found a way to see the game through his unique lens. This enables him to play to the beat of his drum, find angles others wouldn’t, and ensure he’s squeezing the most he can out of his abilities for the good of the team.

I asked Kevin to share that mind with Low Man Help, and he graciously agreed. As good a player as Kevin is, he’s even a better person. I believe it’s a clause in every Canadian birth certificate that families must agree to before leaving the hospital, it’s the Canadian version of a car seat check: “Do you agree to be a good person and love Tim Horton’s coffee above all others?”

Anyways, without further ado, here are three lessons Kevin Pangos would go back and tell his younger self.



# Lessons To Young Kev…

My basketball journey has taken me all over the world: Gonzaga University, Spain (a lot of times), Lithuania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and even a season in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But as I sat down to think about the lessons I’d want to share with younger players, something I wasn’t expecting became apparent: the most impactful lessons I’ve learned have had a lot less to do with basketball than I would have imagined.

The game has tested me in ways I never expected and shaped me into the person I am today. If I could go back and talk to young Kev, that little kid shooting for hours outside, the one who was overly anxious before big games and would often compare himself to other basketball players, I’d share three simple thoughts.

Even though many people reading this may have heard these before, I find myself replaying something Marc would always say to me, “Just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it’s easy.”

Here are the three simple lessons that changed everything for me:

# 1. Learn How To Work Smart and Hard; Not Just Hard

When I was younger, I prided myself on being the hardest worker at my craft. I’d shoot 500 shots on most days, dedicate a few more hours to my body for performance or recovery, and eat foods I didn’t like just because I knew they might give me the slightest edge at reaching my dreams. Now looking back, I by no means think that was the wrong thing to do. I believe dedication and effort set me apart from my competition. However, it became apparent to me later on in my career that I wasn’t always working *smart*. A lot of those reps weren’t game-speed, and I didn’t have a clear purpose behind what I was doing. I just always associated more = better.

It wasn’t until I became very intentional in how I did things that I noticed the difference it could make in my growth. I stopped wasting reps. I started going full game speed, visualizing in-game situations, and knowing exactly *which* shots I was taking, *how* I needed to execute them, and *why* they would be effective.

I stopped guessing about athletic development and began learning about my body, movement patterns, and the instabilities or lack of range I had. My strength coach and mentor, Matt Nichol, taught me the power of taking ownership of my physical development, from mobility and recovery to nutrition and everything in between. From that point forward, training wasn’t just about *working more*; it was about *working right.*

If I could tell my younger self one thing here, it would be:

Hard work is non-negotiable, but smart work is what separates good from great.

# 2. Your Biggest Fears Will Shape You

We all have fears that live in our heads, missing a game-winner, getting cut, embarrassing ourselves in front of a crowd, failing to reach a goal we set out years earlier.

One of my biggest fears was being judged by others.

I never wanted to fail. The thought of failing in front of peers and embarrassing myself terrified me to the core. So, when I got invited to train with the Canadian men’s national basketball team at the age of 15, you can imagine how intense my initial reaction was to the possibility of failing as a 15-year-old against a grown man already playing professional basketball.

I spent the entire camp nervous and anxious, just trying to put my head down and work my ass off. I thought I could finally exhale after a successful camp where I performed well; however... Just before heading home, I was invited on a two-week trip to Italy with the full roster. Now, hearing that you would again think “That’s amazing!”. But, for me, an instant pit in my stomach formed. I had just made it through a successful camp, and now every alarm in my body was going off once again; it was like I was experiencing impostor syndrome.

But I knew what to do. I had to meet my fear head-on.

That trip completely changed my life at 15. I was surrounded by pros for two whole weeks. I tried to absorb everything I could, from how they approached the game to how they carried themselves, and the small ways they found to improve every single day.

I built lifelong relationships and gained lessons I carry with me to this day.[1](#footnote-1)

Going forward, I faced many other difficult moments throughout my career. Things I feared about happening to me. Not performing at the level expected. Bad Injuries. Getting cut from teams.

However, my experience from that camp at 15 helped me realize that those extremely difficult moments can become the most influential.

That month with the National Team taught me resilience, built my confidence, and reminded me that fear is way more in your head than in reality. In fact, it often leads to your biggest growth and a realization that you can handle more than you ever imagined. A growth you would not have come across had you not been through that specific situation.

# 3. You Are Enough; Don’t Compare Yourself to Others.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned, and continue to practice, is not comparing myself to others. It’s so easy to do in sports and life.

For years, I obsessed over things I couldn’t control: my height, my inverted wingspan, my smaller hands. I looked around the NBA and saw guys with freakish athleticism, long arms, and massive hands. I told myself that was what I lacked to play at the highest level.

But those thoughts weren’t helping me. Working with my sports psychologist (shoutout Dr. H), I started to understand what was really going on. Deep down, I didn’t fully believe I was enough.

That changed everything.

Once I stopped seeing those physical traits as weaknesses, I started using them to my advantage. My shot got quicker. I played lower to the ground. I changed direction better. I became more dangerous because I finally *believed I was enough.*

I always think of an iconic image of Michael Phelps from the Olympics, he’s in the lead, focused straight ahead, while his competitor is looking sideways at him. The competitor slowed himself down by focusing on someone else. That’s what comparison does.

Your journey is your journey. *You are enough.*

When I think about having the opportunity to talk to the younger version of myself, the one in the empty gym late at night, the one sweating through nerves before a big moment, the one silently wondering if he’ll measure up, I’d tell him these three simple things:

1. Learn how to work smart, so your hard work is amplified.
2. Don’t fear fear, lean in. Your biggest growth can come from these moments.
3. Never forget that you are enough.

These lessons have carried me through college, the EuroLeague, the NBA, and back overseas. They’ve shaped not only my career but who I am as a person. And for that, I’m grateful for the good moments, the tough ones, and everything in between.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

From that conversation, this post was formed.* 

The basketball world is littered with stories about uber-talented players who never reached their full potential. Ask nearly any coach who has been involved in the game for a while, and I guarantee they will have at least one of those guys, the player who had all the skills but who couldn’t get out of their own way.

**Kevin Pangos is not one of those guys.**

Out of all the professional players I’ve been around, he has squeezed more out of less than any of them. What he has accomplished in his career is nothing short of remarkable. This isn’t a knock on Kevin; it’s quite the opposite. He’s one of the biggest overachievers I’ve been around.

Here’s just a taste of his career accomplishments to date:

* All-EuroLeague First Team (2021)
* All-EuroLeague Second Team (2018)
* All-EuroCup Second Team (2016)
* 2× Lithuanian League champion (2017, 2018)
* All-Lithuanian League Team (2018)
* Lithuanian League Foreign Player of the Year (2018)
* All-VTB United League Second Team (2021)
* Third-team All-American – AP, NABC, TSN (2015)
* WCC Player of the Year (2015)
* 4× First-team All-WCC (2012–2015)
* WCC Newcomer of the Year (2012)

And if that laundry list of awards and accomplishments wasn’t enough, you can sprinkle in the fact that Kevin is the youngest player to ever play for the Canadian senior national basketball team at the age of 15 in the summer of 2009, more on that to come.

Kevin has the two common ingredients I’ve seen in players who punch above their weight class and overachieve: Grit and Creativity.

His grit is on display daily. This guy has battled through countless injuries throughout his career. I highly doubt there’s ever been a day when he’s been fully healthy. He pushes himself to his absolute limit in everything: training, games, practice, and recovery.

Many people possess grit; in the world of elite athletes, it's more common than you might think. Creativity, on the other hand, is far rarer, and it’s the essential element needed to make it at the highest levels when you are a lower class of *raw* athlete than almost everyone else you’re competing against.

If Kevin were to see and play the game through the same lens as players considerably more athletic than he is, he would never have reached the heights he has. His greatest strength isn’t his jumper, even though it’s purer than a bottle of Aqua Panna. Or his handles, even though they’re sharper than a straight-edge razor. No, his most significant strength is his mind.

Kevin has found a way to see the game through his unique lens. This enables him to play to the beat of his drum, find angles others wouldn’t, and ensure he’s squeezing the most he can out of his abilities for the good of the team.

I asked Kevin to share that mind with Low Man Help, and he graciously agreed. As good a player as Kevin is, he’s even a better person. I believe it’s a clause in every Canadian birth certificate that families must agree to before leaving the hospital, it’s the Canadian version of a car seat check: “Do you agree to be a good person and love Tim Horton’s coffee above all others?”

Anyways, without further ado, here are three lessons Kevin Pangos would go back and tell his younger self.



# Lessons To Young Kev…

My basketball journey has taken me all over the world: Gonzaga University, Spain (a lot of times), Lithuania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and even a season in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But as I sat down to think about the lessons I’d want to share with younger players, something I wasn’t expecting became apparent: the most impactful lessons I’ve learned have had a lot less to do with basketball than I would have imagined.

The game has tested me in ways I never expected and shaped me into the person I am today. If I could go back and talk to young Kev, that little kid shooting for hours outside, the one who was overly anxious before big games and would often compare himself to other basketball players, I’d share three simple thoughts.

Even though many people reading this may have heard these before, I find myself replaying something Marc would always say to me, “Just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it’s easy.”

Here are the three simple lessons that changed everything for me:

# 1. Learn How To Work Smart and Hard; Not Just Hard

When I was younger, I prided myself on being the hardest worker at my craft. I’d shoot 500 shots on most days, dedicate a few more hours to my body for performance or recovery, and eat foods I didn’t like just because I knew they might give me the slightest edge at reaching my dreams. Now looking back, I by no means think that was the wrong thing to do. I believe dedication and effort set me apart from my competition. However, it became apparent to me later on in my career that I wasn’t always working *smart*. A lot of those reps weren’t game-speed, and I didn’t have a clear purpose behind what I was doing. I just always associated more = better.

It wasn’t until I became very intentional in how I did things that I noticed the difference it could make in my growth. I stopped wasting reps. I started going full game speed, visualizing in-game situations, and knowing exactly *which* shots I was taking, *how* I needed to execute them, and *why* they would be effective.

I stopped guessing about athletic development and began learning about my body, movement patterns, and the instabilities or lack of range I had. My strength coach and mentor, Matt Nichol, taught me the power of taking ownership of my physical development, from mobility and recovery to nutrition and everything in between. From that point forward, training wasn’t just about *working more*; it was about *working right.*

If I could tell my younger self one thing here, it would be:

Hard work is non-negotiable, but smart work is what separates good from great.

Your journey is your journey. *You are enough.*

When I think about having the opportunity to talk to the younger version of myself, the one in the empty gym late at night, the one sweating through nerves before a big moment, the one silently wondering if he’ll measure up, I’d tell him these three simple things:

1. Learn how to work smart, so your hard work is amplified.
2. Don’t fear fear, lean in. Your biggest growth can come from these moments.
3. Never forget that you are enough.

These lessons have carried me through college, the EuroLeague, the NBA, and back overseas. They’ve shaped not only my career but who I am as a person. And for that, I’m grateful for the good moments, the tough ones, and everything in between.

From that conversation, this post was formed.* 

The basketball world is littered with stories about uber-talented players who never reached their full potential. Ask nearly any coach who has been involved in the game for a while, and I guarantee they will have at least one of those guys, the player who had all the skills but who couldn’t get out of their own way.

**Kevin Pangos is not one of those guys.**

Out of all the professional players I’ve been around, he has squeezed more out of less than any of them. What he has accomplished in his career is nothing short of remarkable. This isn’t a knock on Kevin; it’s quite the opposite. He’s one of the biggest overachievers I’ve been around.

Here’s just a taste of his career accomplishments to date:

* All-EuroLeague First Team (2021)
* All-EuroLeague Second Team (2018)
* All-EuroCup Second Team (2016)
* 2× Lithuanian League champion (2017, 2018)
* All-Lithuanian League Team (2018)
* Lithuanian League Foreign Player of the Year (2018)
* All-VTB United League Second Team (2021)
* Third-team All-American – AP, NABC, TSN (2015)
* WCC Player of the Year (2015)
* 4× First-team All-WCC (2012–2015)
* WCC Newcomer of the Year (2012)

And if that laundry list of awards and accomplishments wasn’t enough, you can sprinkle in the fact that Kevin is the youngest player to ever play for the Canadian senior national basketball team at the age of 15 in the summer of 2009, more on that to come.

Kevin has the two common ingredients I’ve seen in players who punch above their weight class and overachieve: Grit and Creativity.

His grit is on display daily. This guy has battled through countless injuries throughout his career. I highly doubt there’s ever been a day when he’s been fully healthy. He pushes himself to his absolute limit in everything: training, games, practice, and recovery.

Many people possess grit; in the world of elite athletes, it's more common than you might think. Creativity, on the other hand, is far rarer, and it’s the essential element needed to make it at the highest levels when you are a lower class of *raw* athlete than almost everyone else you’re competing against.

If Kevin were to see and play the game through the same lens as players considerably more athletic than he is, he would never have reached the heights he has. His greatest strength isn’t his jumper, even though it’s purer than a bottle of Aqua Panna. Or his handles, even though they’re sharper than a straight-edge razor. No, his most significant strength is his mind.

Kevin has found a way to see the game through his unique lens. This enables him to play to the beat of his drum, find angles others wouldn’t, and ensure he’s squeezing the most he can out of his abilities for the good of the team.

I asked Kevin to share that mind with Low Man Help, and he graciously agreed. As good a player as Kevin is, he’s even a better person. I believe it’s a clause in every Canadian birth certificate that families must agree to before leaving the hospital, it’s the Canadian version of a car seat check: “Do you agree to be a good person and love Tim Horton’s coffee above all others?”

Anyways, without further ado, here are three lessons Kevin Pangos would go back and tell his younger self.

# Lessons To Young Kev…

My basketball journey has taken me all over the world: Gonzaga University, Spain (a lot of times), Lithuania, Italy, Turkey, Russia, and even a season in the NBA with the Cleveland Cavaliers. But as I sat down to think about the lessons I’d want to share with younger players, something I wasn’t expecting became apparent: the most impactful lessons I’ve learned have had a lot less to do with basketball than I would have imagined.

The game has tested me in ways I never expected and shaped me into the person I am today. If I could go back and talk to young Kev, that little kid shooting for hours outside, the one who was overly anxious before big games and would often compare himself to other basketball players, I’d share three simple thoughts.

Even though many people reading this may have heard these before, I find myself replaying something Marc would always say to me, “Just because something is simple, doesn’t mean it’s easy.”

Here are the three simple lessons that changed everything for me:

# 1. Learn How To Work Smart and Hard; Not Just Hard

When I was younger, I prided myself on being the hardest worker at my craft. I’d shoot 500 shots on most days, dedicate a few more hours to my body for performance or recovery, and eat foods I didn’t like just because I knew they might give me the slightest edge at reaching my dreams. Now looking back, I by no means think that was the wrong thing to do. I believe dedication and effort set me apart from my competition. However, it became apparent to me later on in my career that I wasn’t always working *smart*. A lot of those reps weren’t game-speed, and I didn’t have a clear purpose behind what I was doing. I just always associated more = better.

It wasn’t until I became very intentional in how I did things that I noticed the difference it could make in my growth. I stopped wasting reps. I started going full game speed, visualizing in-game situations, and knowing exactly *which* shots I was taking, *how* I needed to execute them, and *why* they would be effective.

I stopped guessing about athletic development and began learning about my body, movement patterns, and the instabilities or lack of range I had. My strength coach and mentor, Matt Nichol, taught me the power of taking ownership of my physical development, from mobility and recovery to nutrition and everything in between. From that point forward, training wasn’t just about *working more*; it was about *working right.*

If I could tell my younger self one thing here, it would be:

Hard work is non-negotiable, but smart work is what separates good from great.

# 2. Your Biggest Fears Will Shape You

We all have fears that live in our heads, missing a game-winner, getting cut, embarrassing ourselves in front of a crowd, failing to reach a goal we set out years earlier.

One of my biggest fears was being judged by others.

I never wanted to fail. The thought of failing in front of peers and embarrassing myself terrified me to the core. So, when I got invited to train with the Canadian men’s national basketball team at the age of 15, you can imagine how intense my initial reaction was to the possibility of failing as a 15-year-old against a grown man already playing professional basketball.

I spent the entire camp nervous and anxious, just trying to put my head down and work my ass off. I thought I could finally exhale after a successful camp where I performed well; however... Just before heading home, I was invited on a two-week trip to Italy with the full roster. Now, hearing that you would again think “That’s amazing!”. But, for me, an instant pit in my stomach formed. I had just made it through a successful camp, and now every alarm in my body was going off once again; it was like I was experiencing impostor syndrome.

But I knew what to do. I had to meet my fear head-on.

That trip completely changed my life at 15. I was surrounded by pros for two whole weeks. I tried to absorb everything I could, from how they approached the game to how they carried themselves, and the small ways they found to improve every single day.

I built lifelong relationships and gained lessons I carry with me to this day.[1](#footnote-1)

Going forward, I faced many other difficult moments throughout my career. Things I feared about happening to me. Not performing at the level expected. Bad Injuries. Getting cut from teams.

However, my experience from that camp at 15 helped me realize that those extremely difficult moments can become the most influential.

That month with the National Team taught me resilience, built my confidence, and reminded me that fear is way more in your head than in reality. In fact, it often leads to your biggest growth and a realization that you can handle more than you ever imagined. A growth you would not have come across had you not been through that specific situation.

# 3. You Are Enough; Don’t Compare Yourself to Others.

One of the hardest lessons I’ve learned, and continue to practice, is not comparing myself to others. It’s so easy to do in sports and life.

For years, I obsessed over things I couldn’t control: my height, my inverted wingspan, my smaller hands. I looked around the NBA and saw guys with freakish athleticism, long arms, and massive hands. I told myself that was what I lacked to play at the highest level.

But those thoughts weren’t helping me. Working with my sports psychologist (shoutout Dr. H), I started to understand what was really going on. Deep down, I didn’t fully believe I was enough.

That changed everything.

Once I stopped seeing those physical traits as weaknesses, I started using them to my advantage. My shot got quicker. I played lower to the ground. I changed direction better. I became more dangerous because I finally *believed I was enough.*

I always think of an iconic image of Michael Phelps from the Olympics, he’s in the lead, focused straight ahead, while his competitor is looking sideways at him. The competitor slowed himself down by focusing on someone else. That’s what comparison does.

She even got me my own Bible and said that I should start at John because God told her to tell me.

I dont know why but during that conversation I said something that changed me I told her ""i feel like a baby lamb and im searching for my shepherd"" and that lifted a weight off me.
