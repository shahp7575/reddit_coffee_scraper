My best friend took advantage of me. I let her live in my house because she was struggling and unfortunately for the wellbeing of my family I had to ask her to leave. She stole hundreds of dollars of decor/furniture poured coffee on my brand new carpets, ripped paint off my walls, tore towel racks and other fixtures out of the walls on the way out. She completely burned the bridge of our relationship and is still messaging me hurtful things and flat out lies. 

I‚Äôm successful in life but I believe it is because I hold myself accountable for my actions, I‚Äôm on medication, and I speak with a therapist when things get hard. 
Because I hold myself together so many people forget I‚Äôm bipolar and things trigger mel. Everyone is expecting me to just get over it and doesn‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôm depressed. 

I‚Äôm so heartbroken and I‚Äôm honestly so close to spiraling. I‚Äôve been completely isolating the best I can to avoid letting this affect my family. 

I feel so used and unlovable. We were best friends for almost 11 years. Idk what I expect anyone to say I just don‚Äôt know who to talk to about this. 

I don‚Äôt know how to cope with losing people. I don‚Äôt wan to end up back in the hospital and I feel like I‚Äôm getting to that point because it just feels so hopeless. ",1,1743641263.0,bipolar,1,1.0,False

1jq4th1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jq4th1,Faro (Tabelog: 3.74; *),"

In my trip meal research, I‚Äôm always interested in finding things I can‚Äôt get at home‚Äîespecially meals that intersect my three favorite cuisines: Japanese, Mexican, and Northern Italian. Faro sounded cool: a plant-based Italian tasting menu using Japanese ingredients. Reviews were good, posted photos looked enticing, and the menu descriptions were very appealing. It was also relatively easy to book.

I walked into a very elegant dining room on the 10th floor of a building in Ginza. Service was attentive and warm‚Äîuntil it wasn‚Äôt (more on that later).

The meal started off well. There were some vegetable canap√©s with a variety of flavors. The first official course featured perfectly cooked Brussels sprouts with a bit of romesco sauce and a vegan cream sauce‚Äîboth delicious. The next course was a warm ‚Äúsalad‚Äù of white asparagus and lily bulb. I wish the portion of vegetables had been a bit more generous, but the standout was the tomato water it was bathed in. There‚Äôs a theme here: really great sauces, for the most part.

Then came the pasta: butterbur ravioli. It didn‚Äôt really look like ravioli, didn‚Äôt have a satisfying mouthfeel, and was under-seasoned. Another theme emerged‚Äîthe noticeable absence of salt throughout the meal. The dish had a tiny bit of cooked morels as a garnish, but it was screaming for some sodium (which, in another menu, a touch of Parmigiano might have provided).

Next was roasted burdock with some turnips and a delicious sauce that tasted more Middle Eastern or North African than Italian. Another theme: aside from the ravioli and a small square of focaccia served with assertive olive oil, there wasn‚Äôt much that felt distinctly Italian about the meal. And not to knock burdock, but another vegetable‚Äîlike artichoke or lotus root‚Äîmight have felt more luxurious. The burdock was just cooked enough but still pretty fibrous and resistant to the knife.

The main course was presented tableside, although it really didn‚Äôt warrant the fanfare. It was a vegetable pie filled with porcini, some unidentifiable vegetables, and a vegan meat substitute. (Yes, that‚Äôs how it was described to me.) It was sliced in half at the table, though it easily could‚Äôve been done in the kitchen and plated with sauce. Once again, the sauce‚Äîmade from a reduction of vegetable scraps‚Äîwas phenomenal. The pie itself was just okay: the crust was well-developed and nicely baked, but the filling resembled something you‚Äôd pour onto a chili dog. I had hoped for actual vegetables to be front and center, not blended into a mushy form.

The pre-dessert was a strawberry sorbet with chamomile tea and a sake gel. I had noted in my reservation that I don‚Äôt drink alcohol. As I was about to say something, the server preemptively told me the sake gel was non-alcoholic. So, I ate around it. I don‚Äôt expect restaurants to bend over backwards for one dietary preference, but I do wish they had just omitted it.

The highlight of the meal was the main dessert: a rose cream topped with pomelo, served with matcha ice cream and ladled with violet sauce. Pure heaven. I‚Äôm salivating just writing about it.

The final course was their signature ‚Äúflower tart‚Äù‚Äîa biscuit topped with cream and covered in edible flowers. Visually stunning. But if you‚Äôre not someone who enjoys biting into a literal bouquet, this may not be for you. And I am not that person.

After that course and my coffee, the previously attentive service took a sharp turn. Servers walked by my table many times as I tried to get their attention to settle the bill. It felt like a switch had been flipped. Eventually, I flagged someone down.

No regrets, but this wasn‚Äôt the vegetable celebration I had hoped for. Most other diners were having the omnivorous menu, which didn‚Äôt seem particularly exciting either. I‚Äôm not sure this would be revelatory for friends of mine who follow a plant-based diet. They might even ask: ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the salt?‚Äù

The last two pics I posted are from earlier: Gyukatsu Motomura for lunch and Sushiro for a very excessive mid-afternoon snack. I love balancing high-end meals with mid- and low-tier options. And I was glad to have some animal protein in my belly before diving into a vegan tasting.",2,1743641087.0,finedining,0,1.0,False

I am >!5‚Äô6!< and i weighed >!155lbs!< when i look back at it, i get so sad because I DIDNT EVEN LOOK THAT BAD. and they were making such a huge deal about it and being so judgy and mean. 

fast forward to now. after my mom shoved a pamphlet for ozempic in my face and signed me up for a pilates membership, i fucking had it. i went online on Ro (after i did not qualify for ozempic with the dr my mom referred me to) lied and said i weighed >!215 lbs!< and had PCOS so i could get a GLP-1. i know this is so awful and i should not be pretending to have a disease that many people are suffering from just to get this medication. not saying this is okay or justified AT ALL, in fact i feel terrible about it but i can‚Äôt stop because that‚Äôs ED for you. to clarify: i didn‚Äôt qualify for any weight loss medications because i didn‚Äôt have a high enough BMI and i do not have any weight related diseases. i just injected my 4th dose of zepbound 3 days ago. i am now >!143 lbs!<. my parents were so happy when i got the medicine in the mail. i told them i lied and they didn‚Äôt care. my dad even bought me a mini fridge for my room to keep the vials in there. 

since zepbound reduces efficacy of birth control pills, i decided to get the copper iud and stop taking bc. the absence of the hormones that have been pumping thru my veins for years has also decreased my appetite. furthermore, my psychiatrist rx‚Äôd me adderall for my ADHD, which also reduces appetite. so basically i am not eating anything at all. i‚Äôve gone from one side of the spectrum to the other. this is not new for me. despite all of the medications, i have a long history of going thru cycles of binging/restricting ever since i was 12 years old (im 24 now). i feel so weak. i get dizzy and see black spots whenever i stand up. but the worst part is‚Ä¶my parents don‚Äôt fucking care. they are still trying to feed me rabbit food and judge me for eating unhealthy things even if that is the only food im having for the entire week. i want to be skinny and do well in school and at my job. i have a full time medical job (12 hour shifts) so working out is very hard for me bc i just do not have time between my job and school (im in grad school). i also can‚Äôt move out of my parents house yet because i can‚Äôt afford it. maybe because im paying 400 bucks a month for stupid zepbound. i feel so messed up in every possible way and idk what to do. im just so sad. even though im losing weight i don‚Äôt even care because im so depressed.

by Preston Dennett

A face-to-face confrontation with an extraterrestrial humanoid ‚Äì it‚Äôs one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. It happens to a lot of people all over the world, and has been going on for a very long time. While many of our governments are now saying that UFOs are real, they still are saying nothing about firsthand humanoid contact cases. The question is why? Is it because humanoid encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have volumes to teach us about this subject? Is it because these cases prove that we are not alone? This video presents ten astonishing cases of direct contact with humanoids of all kinds. These include multiple witness cases, some with compelling physical evidence pointing towards the reality of the experience. Now is the time for truth and transparency with this subject!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. It was 10am one summer morning in 1948 when Ernst-August R. was watching his sheep-herd in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Without warning, all his sheep scattered, and a large saucer-shaped craft landed in the field next to him. Ernst watched it for several moments, and when nothing happened, he approached it, then reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids in jumpsuits and helmets. The beings spoke a strange language then returned into their craft which took off. Afterward, Ernst found burned patches of ground where the craft had rested.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railroad worker Georges Godbout and two others were working on the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada when a top-shaped metallic craft appeared over the tracks. It moved towards them, stopped andthen ¬†a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out from beneath it. He started to look around, but spotting the witnesses, it quickly climbed back into the craft. As the UFO moved off, it made such a loud noise that the three men became physically ill and had to stop work for the day.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, eleven-year-old Anssi Hakala had attended a cousin‚Äôs birthday party, and was bicycling along a forested road back to his home in rural Marttila, Finland. Suddenly a tall greenish humanoid figure appeared, floating above his head. And following him. Anssi biked away in fear. The being quickly disappeared into a craft, and the craft now began to pace Anssi on his bike. As it hovered over Anssi‚Äôs head, it sprayed him with a weird liquid which caused a tickling sensation. Anssi returned home nearly frantic with fear.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) went out to the rural area near his home in Bedarrides, France to pick some edible mushroom near his home. Bending down to pick some mushrooms, he observed what first believed to be two small children. But he changed his mind when he saw that they wore beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. Antoine called out to them, but they laughed and disappeared into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted silently away. Skeptical of UFOs, Antoine wondered if they might have been Chinese spies.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of children from a youth camp by Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia noticed a silver flying saucer hovering at treetop level. Lights blinked around the perimeter. A light flashed on the bottom of the craft, and also on the top of the dome. There were several portholes around the edge, and through one of the portholes, the kids saw a strange humanoid with a very lage head looking down at them. The craft accelerated rapidly away and was gone.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (two eleven-year-old deaf boys) were walking up to the Alm‚Äôs School near Honefoss, Norway. Simultaneously they both noticed a glowing orange object just above the nearby treeline. Seconds later, it glided towards them, stopped, and landed a short distance away. They could now see a weird humanoid looking out at them from one of the portholes The craft took off, leaving behind unmistakable landing traces in the field.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10:00 pm on the night of August 31, 1978, at the same time as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias were amazed to see a solid, oval-shaped craft with portholes hovering near their farm. After moving around the area, it then ejected two figures with glowing red eyes who floated a few inches above the ground, approaching the farm. The two figures circled around their sheds, seeming to inspect the farm. They remained on the property for nearly an hour before finally leaving. It was one of more than twenty encounters in the area both before and after this event.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an unnamed boy was walking through a construction site near his home in Cosenza, Italy when the landscape around him lit up like daylight. As the light faded, he saw a craft sitting on a hill a short distance away. On top of it stood a strange humanoid figure. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He ran, tripped and fainted. When he awoke, he was surrounded by four humanoids. He jumped up and tried to fight them, but fainted again. When he awoke, they were gone. He noticed that the house next door had lost power.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10pm on November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund sat in the kitchen of his home in Daviken, Sweden drinking coffee, when he noticed a very weird-looking, short figure in his yard. The figure stood with legs spread wide and arms outstretched. It wore a shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to investigate this strange figure, Rune watched as it disappeared into thin air. Rune later learned a police officer was stopped in his car as a UFO flew over him not far away and on the same night. Also, one year earlier, Rune‚Äôs neighbor said that he observed a short humanoid outside his home, which also disappeared into thin air.

PLEASE TELL ME I‚ÄôM NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one evening in the summer of 1999 and a fourteen-year-old girl was in the second story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Suddenly, sheard a deafening screeching noise right outside her window. Looking outside, she saw a very weird-looking, three-foot-tall creature with grayish skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, ran into the bedroom, and saw the creature. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten amazing humanoid encounters show how truly strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts are only a tiny portion of the huge number of documented cases on record. So many cases. So many kinds of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is over. We are not alone!

I‚Äôve been chasing personal growth for a while now ‚Äî building a business, training hard, trying to be consistent. But I‚Äôve noticed something kind of scary:  
It‚Äôs *way* harder to stay disciplined when my brain‚Äôs foggy and my energy dips by noon.

Like yeah, I could ‚Äújust push through‚Äù‚Ä¶ but when I‚Äôm underslept or burnt out, my willpower disappears.  
So I started wondering:

**What if discipline isn‚Äôt just about motivation‚Ä¶ what if it‚Äôs also about brain chemistry, energy, systems, cognitive function?**

I started experimenting with some basics ‚Äî creatine, adaptogens, even swapped coffee for green tea caffeine ‚Äî and the compounding effect surprised me. It wasn‚Äôt magic, but I started feeling more *clear*. More ‚Äúon.‚Äù And that made doing the hard stuff easier.

Circumstances currently bleak.","Hi, so I'm a magnet for misfortune. If I didn't have a fairly-well functioning brain I would absolutely be convinced of conspiracy, but no...I just have anomalous RNG on the negative side. Whee.

Anyway, I just built a rig in the 'alright' spectrum, after my former roommate and ""best"" friend absconded with the contents of my storage unit because all my neat electronics and custom gaming PC were needed to fund his fentanyl hobby (I was and am sort of in a mid-move state, until my new apt is ready). So with the last of my funds I cobbled together a build with an i5 and Gigabyte 2060, referenced in Pic 1. In Pic 2 you can see the top vent where my new bud/neighbor (who was playing Rimworld and becoming quickly addicted even though he scoffed when I first sang its praises to him earlier) knocked over a giant cup of soda in the worst possible place. I came in from the kitchen and from his panicky babbling, I found out that the PC I had enjoyed for only 4 days so far after 2 months of nothing but a crappy android phone had apparently failed the pepsi challenge.

tldr soda went in top vent and the rig apparently shut down IMMEDIATELY. I unplugged it and started to do what I could with isopropyl alcohol and some coffee filters, but it really didn't seem that bad....you can see in pic 3 and 4 that there's no massive amount of soda caking the mobo, there was some all around the place but I removed the heatsink, ram, etc and tried cleaning it. But unfortunatley, nothing. It shows absolute 0 signs of life (this is after cleaning it and letting it dry for upwards of 48 hours with a fan on low next to it).  Is this mostly an indication that the PSU got hammered the hardest?

I'm just curious about other opinions, because I have to be really frugal when I even actually get something in my bank account. I think it might be the PSU? Should that be the first thing I try replacing when I'm not completely broke? Also, should I stop having friends? Or is it possible to be friends with anyone who isn't an agent of destruction? I had a source of entertainment for 3 days and now I'm crestfallen.

1jq4knz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jq4knz/can_anyone_provide_advice_for_getting_over_a/,Can anyone provide advice for getting over a toxic ex to whom you still feel attached?,"For the past 6 or so months, I've had a very intense, turbulent casual relationship with someone I met through school. She pursued me, and quite aggressively, so I initially felt it was a dream come true. She is smart, cool, and I find her very cute. We became intimate, at her behest, quite quickly, and I believe I found those experiences to be highly conducive to bonding, since she was my first, despite my being in my late 20s.

It came out eventually, about a month or so in, that she was only looking to date casually for the time being, as her mental health had been in quite a grim state shortly prior to us meeting. She speculated that she may be up to trying out something serious within a year or so. Nonetheless, she continued to act as though we were committed, in my opinion, and began escalating in that regard. She'd stay over for days at a time, ask me about my thoughts on marriage and children, ask me to go on a coffee run for us in the morning, ask me to move in with her and her roommate, ask me to go on vacation with her over the holidays. She would also incessantly inquire after my availability, and petition for me to acquiesce into letting her come over whenever I said I was busy with work. At first this was flattering, as though she found me to be someone she couldn't stand to be apart from. However, I soon began to regard it as something of a ""red flag"": did she not respect my long-term goals enough to let me meet my deadlines?

The contradiction between her professed availability being merely casual and her de facto conduct suggesting a desire for deeper intimacy began to unsettle me: what was it that she wanted? What could she offer? At the same time, behaviors began being exhibited that disturbed and depressed me. For instance, she would make ogling faces at random men whilst walking with me, turning to ask ""isn't he the most beautiful man you've ever seen?"" If I said something that she took the wrong way - and she often seemed determined to take things the wrong way - she would either erupt in rage, calling me names ranging from ""stupid"" to ""a\*\*hole"" to ""f\*cking pr\*ck,"" or would storm off and slam doors behind her. I walked in on her mocking my thesis draft to a friend, and rather than apologize, she merely said ""you weren't supposed to hear that."" While intimate, she would sometimes push boundaries I had previously established by performing certain acts without asking, or if I wasn't interested in becoming intimate, she would badger me, admitting that she gets off on breaking down resistance until she gets her way. Resentment and alarm built quickly, but she continued to, every so often, shower me with the most unimaginably sweet praise, so I tried to look past problematic behavior on the grounds that she was beginning to fall for me, as I had for her. I'm sure I wasn't the perfect pseudo-boyfriend, being sexually timid, unskilled, and insecure (I did ask about the exes she would compliment as well-endowed, for example), so I'm not trying to cast her as a demon and myself as an angel. I did feel as though these developments were concerning, however.

It came out about another month later that she had gone out with another man the same night she and I had a date. She left my bed with vague complaints of school-related stress, which I found suspect, and didn't text back until after noon the following day. When this came to light, she insisted ""nothing happened"" and that she was within her rights because we hadn't had a discussion regarding exclusivity. While perhaps technically true, I couldn't help feeling shocked and hurt by the duplicity, and the nonchalance of making oneself romantically (and possibly sexually) available for another whilst professing such adoration for me.

Things hobbled on for months, with the occasional highlight keeping growing reservations at bay. However, the fun and closeness eventually became less and less frequent, and the time she had once devoted to getting to know and spend time with me she began allocating to someone she had previously told me was ""just a friend."" She'd ignore my messages to attend to his. She'd leave our outings prematurely to rush off to see him. She would flirt blatantly with him in front of me, practically climbing all over him, and would turn away from conversation with me literally mid-sentence to strike one up with him. Perhaps I played a part in alienating her with my insecurities, but I also feel like she would sniff out and aggravate these same insecurities early in our knowing one another. Maybe that's me letting myself off the hook, however. Whatever the cause, whether I drove her away or the thrill merely wore off, she began pulling away, slowly but unmistakably.

I didn't have concrete, irrefutable evidence that she'd moved on to him, but the drying up of affection - she hadn't texted me in weeks or called me in months, rejected the vast majority of my proposed dates, never stayed the night, began referring to us dating as us ""hanging out,"" and introducing me to friends, to whom I'd never been mentioned before evidently, as ""a friend"" - made it difficult to avoid that she was lost to me. I made a very short effort to get on as friends, but she was as dispassionate, caustic, and short-tempered then as she was while we were dating, calling a recommendation I made concerning a project ""so stupid"" in public, exhibiting utter disregard for my feelings and breaking my spirit. I also invited her out to a show, to which she'd agreed. However, when the day came, she didn't reach out to cancel. She simply didn't show up. There was no apology afterward for standing me up. I don't merit the slightest courtesy in her eyes, I guess.

My family tells me that I should be grateful she's no longer in my life, as she took advantage of my low self-esteem to get what she wanted out of me before discarding me. Maybe that's true, but even if she was manipulating me all the while, I can't seem to forget those tender times and heart-warming words, and see in them some pathetic hope for the restoration of a bond that was probably only ever one-sided.

Is there anything I can do to manage this unbelievable pain? I'm embarrassed to be so distraught, but she was my first ""real"" romantic and sexual connection in years, and was the partner with whom I experienced several firsts, and I suspect that makes things worse. Additionally, I'll unfortunately have to see her around uni for years to come, and I'm not sure how I'll be able to bear that, given how inseparable we once were and how into me she once seemed.",1,1743640383.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

He‚Äôs a 5 yo pitbull mix. I got him from the Humane Society in 2021, and while I love him, his severe separation anxiety and reactivity have left me feeling trapped and overwhelmed.  

He is so sweet and LOVES people, but is reactive with big dogs. I don‚Äôt know anything about his history, but it‚Äôs very obvious there‚Äôs some trauma. He does seem to tolerate medium/small dogs. From the day I got him, he escapes from crates‚Äìeven injuring himself to get out. I tried applying the techniques from dog trainers on YouTube like feeding him in the crate, playing in the crate, but they didn‚Äôt work with him and with my job at the time, I had to leave him alone a few times a week. I then switched to keeping him in my bedroom and used a gate to block the door, which worked okay. If I placed the gate wrong, he would knock it over and chew up the door. We recently moved to a studio while I‚Äôm in grad school and he regularly knocks over the gate and has destroyed the front door trying to get out. I‚Äôm looking for other gate options for the space but he is smart and knows he can move it. I‚Äôm on my third gate! Aside from the crate/gate isssue, he barks and cries which is not ideal in an apartment. I‚Äôve checked on him on my Ring camera and caught him howling and crying when I was gone. I try talking to him from the Ring camera to calm him, but I think that stresses him out more.üíî

I started increasing our walks to almost an hour daily, but recently he started peeing on carpets despite those long pre-departure walks.  

I would love to bring him with me more places like pet friendly coffee shops while I get my work done, but between his separation anxiety and reactivity to other dogs (barking/lunges I can‚Äôt take him many places.  

What I‚Äôve tried:
- Exercise/mental stimulation before leaving.  
- CBD treats which work a little but not enough
- I even play Bluey or dog TV when I leave (he does watch it üòÖ)
- Food distractions (multiple frozen Kongs & puzzles).  
- Baby gates & crates (he breaks them)

Currently, I can‚Äôt afford professional training. I‚Äôm saving up for a $400 virtual training with a local trainer, so I‚Äôm praying that it helps with our issues. I‚Äôm not able to board him regularly while I‚Äôm taking classes and working, although I think that would help. I‚Äôm also navigating depression and feel absolutely overwhelmed. I‚Äôve questioned rehoming for a few years but don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair to him. I don‚Äôt know what else to do and I feel like I‚Äôm failing him. 

What else can I do? I love this fur boy so much but don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the best fit for him. I feel like he needs a yard and maybe a household with multiple people who can give him all the attention he needs. I‚Äôm heartbroken over this but want what‚Äôs best for him. Brutal honesty welcome.

Other names related to the Dead Sea are **Salt Sea**, **Lake of Sodom**, and **Lake Asphaltites** from Latin and Greek.

[View of the Dead Sea in the eastern bank of Jordan](https://preview.redd.it/rtprk0agxhse1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eff726b2b45ce71ec81215e682bf4cfe68f85993)

As of now in date, the lake's surface is 439.78 metres (1,443¬†ft) below¬†sea level, making its shores the¬†lowest land-based elevation¬†on Earth. The Dead Sea depth is about 304¬†metres (997¬†ft), the deepiest hypersaline lake in the world, the other being the Great Salt Lake in Utah, United States. With a salinity of 342 g/kg or 34.2% in 2011, the lake is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, which is 9.6 times as saltier than any oceans on Earth. The density of the lake is 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating and swimming lessons to nearly become obsoleted. Animals and plants in this hypersaline lake cannot flurish and dies out due to higher salinity, making a harsh environment hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern basin is 50 kilometres (31¬†mi) long and 15 kilometres (9¬†mi) wide at its widest point.

# Formation

The Dead Sea was formed in approximately 3 million years ago, as the African and Arabian plates began embarking on their slow seperation from each other, a huge depression formed within the Earth's crust. Over aeons, this depression had gradually filled with water sourced from the Jordan River and various smaller tributaries feeding into it. As the relentless desert sun caused the waters of this ancient lake to evaporate in air, it bequeathed a treasure trove of minerals, including a staggering concentration of salt, magnesium, potassium, and bromine. These intricate geological processes bestowed upon the Dead Sea its distinctive salinity and unparalleled buoyancy in the hypersaline water.

[The formation process of the Dead Sea for millennia, pictured from left to right](https://preview.redd.it/1yess6ei7ise1.jpg?width=610&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f472efaffa9ca3cf2f299062ce474e867619d648)

# Activities and Tourism

The Dead Sea is a hypersaline lake designed for tourists to float on water effortlessly, imaging being like corks or buoys, due to higher density. There are lifeguard stands in several beaches to supervise the tourists for safety, and areas for tourists to moisturize their skins with mud or other materials. Swimming lessons were becoming nearly obsoleted as tourists buoyant on saltwater while swimming, as sinking or drowning is impossible again due to higher density in the water. Tourists can also read newspapers and books while floating in the lake, in addition to holding coffees and teas, and even phones that are waterproofed.

Several hotels and resorts are located near the shores of the Dead Sea, each are ranked five-star for luxary experiences. They offer swimming pools that are freshwater for guests, and private beaches to float in the lake. Moreover, there are several beaches that are accessible to the general public, allowing tourists from locals to float in the Dead Sea freely without having to rent hotels for stays (unless purchasing day passes). The most famous beach in the Dead Sea is Amman Beach, which is a public beach with a resort offering swimming pools and bars for local tourists. The Dead Sea is located about 60 kilometres (38 mi) northeast of Amman, the capital city of Jordan, and only take an hour to drive there via Highway 65 (Dead Sea Highway).

Now is the time ‚Äî we have until 4/8 to make our voices heard so that California passes SB 712 to EXEMPT 35-YEAR OLD COLLECTOR CARS FROM BIENNIAL SMOG CHECKS.  
  
As many of you know, most of California requires a smog check every 2 years for all cars, even those that have Historical Vehicle plates and are barely driven. Passing these tests ‚Äî with limits lower than they were when the cars were new, by the way ‚Äî puts a huge financial burden on us for little to no benefit. We‚Äôre not daily-driving these classics, so the actual emissions from taking these cars to shows and Cars & Coffees are less than a rounding error. They‚Äôre effectively zero.  
  
Jay Leno is supporting Senator Shannon Grove‚Äôs bill to exempt collector cars 35 years or older. This is a rolling exemption, so EVEN IF YOUR COLLECTOR CAR ISN‚ÄôT YET 35, you‚Äôll benefit from this.

A previous version of this bill required the cars to have ""collector insurance,"" which is something that doesn't actually exist. It's been amended to simply use CA's existing definition of a collector car. 

  
SO, CALL YOUR REPS and tell them how much this bill means to you.  
  
And then tell them again.  
  
PS: To any of you who think I want to destroy our planet, don‚Äôt forget that while I have 9 classic cars, my daily driver for the last 8 years has been an electric VW e-Golf, charged with 100% zero-emission power. I want clean air, but I also want to be able to keep driving my cranky, miserable, manual-transmission old cars who hate me. Both should be possible.

1jq4ar3,https://www.reddit.com/r/mancave/comments/1jq4ar3/blank_slate_with_some_furniture/,Blank slate with some furniture.,"Hi Everyone,

I have a conditioned (air/heat) insulated one car garage that I have claimed as my mancave. It is 12x24 rectangle. I have a glass door on the center of one wall, a garage door on one end, and a high window on the other end (see photo). I have pre-wred for two TVs, speakers, and a Wifi Access Point.

On the back wall with the window, I have plumbing for a sink.  Looking into the mancave from the garage door, the sink plumbing is in the right corner on the back wall.

My theme is ""Dive Bar'.  

I have some questions and would  appreciate your feedback!:

1. I'm struggling between having a 12 foot cabinet built across the entire back wall, and putting a sink in the cabinet, versus doing individual pieces of furniture along the back wall. Note - I have a nice liquor cabinet 4X4X7 ft tall I want to use in the cave.  

Q: Would you go individual pieces along the back wall or a cabinet across the entire wall? The wife thinks a cabinet across the back wall will look like a 'kitchen'.  A cabinet could include the sink, and I'm really struggling finding a 'stand alone sink' idea for a dive bar.  

 Also, I  have a 41 inch tall/36 inch round high metal table with bar stools, and a couch I will incorporate in the design.  I'm looking for ideas for a 'coffee table' / end table.  

if you have any thoughts or ideas I would love to hear them.  Also, if anyone knows of a simple application where I could place photos of furniture into a space, please let me know.

Thanks for reading.

I suppose this has already been asked many times, but time passes, new possibilities arise, more people join the community, so: please share any non-standard automations you've made - to inspiere others or just to brag about them :)

The main reason I am asking, besides being curious, is because I am about to build a new smart home soon and I would like to get some cool automation ideas.

I will start with mine (in the appartment I live currently):

\- One hour before my phone alarm goes off (if I am at home) the AC unit in my office will turn on if needed (heat or cool the room, depending on the temperature). So when I wake up and go there half-naked the temperature is pleasant.

\- I wish I could also automate my coffee maker to start warming up 5 minutes before the alarm goes off, but I can't ... yet.

\- When I put my watch to sleep mode many things happen: The door locks; All lights go off; Any music from a Google Home speaker stops; The PC switches audio output to headphones; The PC screensaver (blank screens) kicks in immediately.

\- An Aqara FP2 sensor tracks presence in several zones in my living room, where I also have a bed. If there is presence anywhere in the room except the bed, a light turns on. If there is no presence (or only in the bed) the light turns off. Between 3am and 8am that light is with 30% brightness. So, when someone enters the room the light turns on. When I go to bed (and there is noone else in the room) it turns off. When I wake up to pee in the middle of the night it turns on just barely, not to blind me. When I go back to bed it turns back off. That sensor is capable of ignoring my cat, so she doesn't turn on the lights at night. All of this works 95% of the time.

\- The camera only sends me push notifications on motion if noone is home. That is determined by whether my phone or my wife's phone is in the home WiFi. Geolocation is not that practical in an appartment building. Because the camera cannot distinguish pets from humans, I have added an additional condition to only send motion notifications if the presence sensor detects a human.

\- When the TV is turned on, the music (if any) from a Google Home speaker stops.

\- When I press the red button (the unused teletext-related one) on my TV remote lights turn off. The blue one toggles the air conditioner on / off (to heat or cool based on temperature).

\- A red light in a corner is on while the front door is unlocked. When it locks / unlocks my PC makes some noise to let me know.

\- I have an ""auto"" mode for the (dumb) air conditioner in the living room to keep the temperature within set limits (heating or cooling if needed). This is mostly to make sure the cat is comfortable while we're on vacation.

And some automations I have planned for the new home:

\- Bathroom lights to turn on / off based on presence, the exhaust fan to turn on if there is presence for some time (i.e. on number 2 and / or shower) and stay on for a while after there is no more presence. There will be a smart switch to control these and it should work just like a dumb switch, so guests don't get confused, but also play nice together with these automations.

\- Living room / kitchen lights to turn on / off based on presence in specific zones and whether the TV is on. There will be 3 lights above 3 distinct zones + the kitchen, so it makes a lot of sense to lighten the zones where people are present (e.g. when on the dining table).

\- A dashboard with the appartment floor plan, showing the state of different devices, including presence in specific rooms / zones.

\- An in-house intercom system - some convenient way to talk to someone in another room. I'm not sure how exactly I will do it. Looks like both Google Home and Alexa were able to do that in the past, but not anymore :(

\- If I ever buy curtain / blinds motors, I will need an AI to detect when my wife is about to take off her clothes and close the curtains / blinds ... just to annoy the neighbors living across :)",3,1743638884.0,smarthome,0,1.0,False
1jq41ia,https://i.redd.it/2dxidobjhise1.jpeg,Crazy Landlord Trying to move in after her son moves out,"Hello, I am in need of some advice of how to deal (if i can) with my landlord.

For context:

I am currently month-to-month with my landlord. I have no real choice but to stay at my current place because of the flexibility, which is important because I am applying for my PharmD, and I can't sign another lease elsewhere due to finances. I find out if I get into the program in June at the latest.

In my current situation, the landlord's son is my roommate (voiding LTB rules), and she is c r a z y. She tried to install Ring cameras that only she has access to (since resolved), doesn't come by with notice (ik she absolutely can because of the LTB rules being voided since her son lives with me).

She also tries to police us about numerous things, like having the house unreasonably clean (i have 5 roommates, and she expects it to look showroom condition no matter the circumstance). She also complains about the cost of utilities, comparing her utilities cost of 300 dollars at her house when its only her and her husband, with ours being $700 with 6 people (and to think this lady is an accountant). She has also done showings without notice to other tenants. There is also no winning with her as she is incredibly delusional.


Now that you have an idea of who I am dealing with, I wanted to see if there is anything I can do with regards to her moving in or using his room ""from time to time"" (her son strongly dislikes his mom, he said so himself, and has said that she plans on actually moving in) I know her ulterior motive is to be able to have the LTB rules voided. Is there anything I can do?

TL;DR: Crazy landlord wants to move in after her son moves out. Is there anything I can do against this since technically for that period of time that he moves out, I won't be living with an immediate family member of the landlord?",0,1743638857.0,OntarioLandlord,5,0.5,False

In her complaint against Justin Baldoni & Jamey Heath, she claims they shared a story with her about swapping a woman.  
  
Blake‚Äôs story is that Justin went on a date, figured out that she wasn‚Äôt the one, and then gave her to Jamey. This is not what happened. According to Jamey and his wife, Natasha met Justin at a club. She is a former professional dancer.  
  
After a night of dancing, Justin and Natasha get together later for coffee at a later date. At the coffee they chat and he invites her to an event hosted with his faith.  
  
Natasha begins attending Bahai‚Äôi activities. During an event, Jamey & Natasha were partnered together to work on an activity. They had to stare at each other for 5 minutes. Jamey said he fell in love with Natasha then.  
  
Blake called Justin Baldoni a sociopath after he shared with her that he and his wife often stare into each other‚Äôs eyes. An obvious exercise they do as a part of their faith.  
  
Natasha was not a left over piece of Justin Baldoni & for Blake to frame this story is such a disgusting way is a horrible slam of Natasha. In the complaint, Blake acted as though the woman was just some conquest. Nope, her complaint is about Jamey‚Äôs wife. The mother of his children. A woman that he loves.  
  
Blake twists the most innocent situations and turns them into grievances that do not exist.  
  
My heart goes out to Natasha & Jamey. Blake is shameful.""

1. I've recently converted from coffee to Chimarrao, (my wife's Brasillian).   and have a few questions.   I have a Calabash gourd and two metal gourds.   I've found that even if I wash the calabash gourd by midday, it's still a little bit damp by the next morning - how long does it take to dry out completely, and should I buy multiple so I can rotate them?    

2. I'm also wondering about Chimarrao specificially, I'm using the disc-shaped many-holed bombilla, and mostly have mastered the art of creating the mountain correctly, but still get some dust through the bombilla - is this normal?    

2.5 How do I go about using all the mate in the mountain as the drink progresses?  do I scoop out the used chimarrao into the bin and re-form the mountain?  or some other method?

3. given that I like this flavour (Barao de cotegipe) , what other mates should I try?   is there as much of a fuss with creating the mountain correctly with courser mates like Argentinian?    and will my wife be shunned by her Brasillian friends if I drink Argentine Yerba?  :-)

1jq3liu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffeezilla_gg/comments/1jq3liu/what_happened_with_karl_jobst_is_a_perfect/,What happened with Karl Jobst is a perfect example of why coffee should remain silent about his case with Logan,"
Karl Jobst just lost his case against Billy Mitchell and he was slapped with 350k AUD$ damages and he could be on the hook to pay Mitchell's attorney fees as well.

Karl made videos about gaming and speed running frauds and cheaters, he is the one who exposed the completionist charity fraud last year (or the year before, I don't remember)
He made videos about Mitchell. In one of his videos,  he said that Mitchell pushed another YouTuber into committing suicide due to overwhelming him with legal fees that the YouTuber allegedly owed him from a previous case settlement. That statement was incorrect, this dead YouTuber was never actually ordered to pay anything in his settlement with Mitchell.


Now you'd think that's bad enough right? Nope, Jobst doubled down on his opinion and made more videos about Mitchell (sponsored by NordVPN) and he was very hostile towards him in those videos and appearances too (unlike coffee who is always professional with his targets).

Did you know that this was used against him in lawsuit and was an aggravating factor of this large sum of money he has to pay? 

This is what the judge had to say:

""5] In an interview podcast published on Twitter and played in evidence,349 Mr Jobst said
he made the offending video as part of trying to build his YouTube channel and
described Mr Mitchell as a ‚Äúcontent creating machine.‚Äù When asked about that in his
evidence, he agreed that he meant that Mr Mitchell generates a significant amount of
content that he sees as beneficial to his channel.350 In tweets he published in
September 2023, he said about this proceeding itself, ‚ÄúI get a lot of content out of it
‚Ä¶ after the trial there will be a lot more content ‚Ä¶ content feeds my family etc.‚Äù351
He also participated in another interview online, in which he said that he made
multiple videos about Mr Mitchell to earn the money to afford to defend this claim.352
[526] Mr Jobst was open about the fact that his principal sources of income are generated,
directly or indirectly, from videos he makes. The more views he gets, the more
income he receives and the more followers he has, the more likelihood that he will be
paid, not only by YouTube, but also by advertisers and by ‚ÄúPatreon‚Äù donations.3""

In short, Coffee is doing the right thing by remaining silent as running his mouth unnecessary about the case will give Logan more material he can use against him. I just want to say that I am not comparing Coffee to Karl, he is far more professional and respectful than him, but the situation is not all that different.

I believe honesty is the best policy, so I'm going to be extremely open and honest with you all so that I don't mislead you in anyway. Get ready to read!

I am a 31 year old south Asian man that lives in the DFW area. I'm about 5'6"" and I have a slim build. I'm pretty introverted, so I like to spend most of my time at home watching YouTube videos. I'm not too deep into anime culture, but I have enjoyed watching a few shows in the past. Some of the shows I really enjoyed watching were Death Note, Samurai Champloo, Afro Samurai, Ghost Stories (Dubbed), and One Punch Man (I only watched the first season though lol). I'm also not too deep in gaming culture. However, I am fine with getting into it. I also love finding new music to listen to. I love listening to rap, hip hop, R&B, rock/Metal, pop, Indie, K pop, lo-fi, and some country. Like I said, I'm usually a bit of an introvert, but when I do feel like socializing, I like to try out new restaurants, coffee shops and bars.

A few things I should mention:

1. I don't want to be with someone that has kids nor do I want any kids of my own in the future.
2. I haven't been in a relationship in a VERY long time. The last time I was in a relationship was 15 years ago and it was a LDR that lasted 4 months
3. I come from a very religious conservative family however, I don't really consider myself that religious. I just pretend to make my family happy. I still kind believe in God, but I don't agree with everything the church teaches.
4. Politically, I would say I'm more on the left, but tbh I don't really like to go too deep into politics because I find it all tiresome.
5. I come from a small family and its mainly because I've cut a lot of my family members out of my life. The family members I like though live in other states/countries so I don't see them that often.
6. I don't really care for having a wedding. I would much rather use that money and go on a nice long vacation/honeymoon. 
7. Dogs and cats are cool, but I don't think I would want to take care of one at the moment.
8. I currently still live at home with my family. Times are tough, but I am working on my finances and also working on bettering my mental health. Goal is to get a better paying job and find a place of my own.

Now since I am 31, I would like to be with someone from the age range of 25-41. I'm not insecure about my height, so it's fine if you're a few inches taller and also enjoy wearing heels. I'm not into drugs of any kind and I don't really want to be with someone who smokes/vapes (Yes, even Weed). I don't drink that often, but I'm fine if you're a light/social drinker. I'm also only looking for a monogamous relationship with cis women.

I hope I was very clear on everything lol. If I sound like a catch or if you have any questions, please DM me! Also I should mention that I don't use this account that often so sorry if I take a day or two to get back to you!",1,1743637210.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I thought this was a good place to share my wholesome story so here goes.



I, 23 F, have been working at a bar in my area as a waitress for over 3 years. In my 3+ years there I have been hit on many times, I'm blonde and super flirty sometimes for the tips, but I never took anyones number. Once about a year in, I left my number for someone but it didn't pan out and that's when I decided officially no cross mingling. I have also had absolutely awful dating experiences in the past 3 years (Im talking abusive and BAD). Back in July of 2024 I had a total of 3 shifts serving, one Wednesday and two Thursdays in the span of two weeks, I had changed my availability so technically those days I shouldn't have been booked but it hadn't kicked in yet so the days I had booked off just didn't line up and I had to go in (that's what I get for trying to finesse a whole month off lol). On the second shift of the month I served a guy, lets call him A. A came in with two friends of his who work for him and I thought A was super cute (think Miles Teller but with a very kind smile). We chatted a little when his workers/friends stepped outside for smokes, I noticed him more than I normally did of customers, but they ended up just eating and leaving after joking around with me a little.

  

The next week I only worked one shift and I was sooooo close to giving it away but I realized I kind of do need to pay rent so I went in lol. Lo and behold, with me serving on the opposite side of the restaurant as the previous week, A and his friends come in again-and get sat in my section AGAIN. Huge coincidence and I am super happy, chatting and joking with A (kind of ignoring his friends but they didn't seem to care lol), but I have my rule of not co-mingling with customers so after they pay they leave and I pout a little bit missing my Miles Teller looking guy before walking over to clean and reset their table. At my restaurant on the dining side (which is where I am located on this particular day) we have paper and crayons on the table, and right beside where my name is on the table paper I see a name and a number written down. I take three pictures to make sure I save it to my phone before clearing the table. I am a giddy, smiley, sloppy, mess for the rest of the night just debating on if I should message him (in our conversations I learned they live 4 hours away from where I live and were just in town for work and that was their last night in my city), but I am incredibly single so I say F it - lets message him. So when I get home from work I message him, and by the next day we are texting. Over the weekend we chat a fair deal and he is as genuine, funny, and kind as he seemed. He tells me how he has never left a number for a waitress and I tell him how I have never taken a number left for me before so it's both our firsts lol. On the Sunday he says he is in town the following Tuesday for work and asks if I would be up for dinner, I obviously am ECSTATIC but play it cool and say sure (I had by coincidence had that day booked off or else I 100% would have been working).

  


Tuesday we meet at the restaurant and we just immediately mesh together, we talk for hours until he feels bad for how long we had sat at a booth taking up a servers table and we move to the bar to have drinks (he is the most polite to wait staff-huge green flag). After the bar we just keep talking and driving around for hours, kissing a little, but mostly getting to know each other. That weekend I drive up to his town to see him and by the middle of August we are inseparable. He is caring, giving, kind, treats me like a princess, and I know I'm a goner. I admittedly am freaking out because I've never been treated so good so I try and self sabotage by making him talk about serious topics early on to ""make sure we match"" but he is down for the convo and we DO match (jokes on me). So when he asked me to be his girlfriend I had no other choice than to say yes because he is someone who radiates love, happiness, and joy and I would be a fool to let him go. And when we were laying under a blanket of stars at his family's cottage and he told me he loved me, I had no other choice than to say it back-he had given me no choice but to fall in love with him, he's genuinely incredible. He brings me coffee in bed, surprises me with treats, always insists on buying me food, makes me feel like the most beautiful person in the world when I have never felt like that before. He holds me when I cry and I know with him I am safe. I hope every day I get to watch him become everything he wants to be because I want to support him for the rest of my life, the way I know he will support me for the rest of mine.

  


So now, every week I drive 4 hours each way to go visit him, and I listen to Two Hot Takes to keep me company every drive. So thank you reddit and thank you Morgan for making my driving for my medium-distance relationship a little less lonely. Though I would drive to him in total silence, or in ear piercing noise-but this podcast does make the drive go by a lot faster.",9,1743637014.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,0.91,False

I have been doing my homework researching this topic and taking into account alot of advice on here thanks to you wonderful people. 

I have taken the following actions.

Supplements stack:
Nattokinase
Creatine 5g**
D3 k2**
Berberine 
Magnesium glycinate**
Boswellia/turmeric
Hemp Seeds
Chia seeds
Psyllium Husk

** already taking prior to changes

Diet Changes:
- Drastically reduce saturated fat. Was eating a lot of peanut butter, cheese, dark cholesterol, never looked at saturated fat.
- Stop earing fatty red meat, I often eat red meat such as skirt steak.
- Stop cuban coffee(expresso) Daily
- Reduce/Eliminate dietary cholesterol. (I was eating on average 3 eggs per day fried in butter, with avocado). I used to think dietary cholesterol was ok but didn't take into account that I'm likely a high absorber.
- had already reduced carbs, breads, sweets, although I was eating dark chocolate not knowing its high saturated fat content.

These are my labs which triggered me to start taking action. I had already made adjustments to my diet to reduce carb and sugar intake but never paid close attention to the lipids like saturated fat, cholesterol. I have come to the conclusion that I may be a high absorber due to my family history. My father has always had high cholesterol, heart attack at 70, smoker most his life. I too at a younger age had signs of elevated cholesterol.l, but nothing overly concerning. I'd also like to add i tend to have slightly elevated blood pressure at say 130/80 for example, which is something both my father and mother deal with. 

ApoB 110
hs-CRP 1.5 mg/l
LDL-C 159 mg/dl
Non-HDL Cholesterol 180 mg/dl
Total cholesterol/ HDL ratio 3.9
Lipoprotein 14 nmol/l

RDW 10.6%
RF 15 IU/ml
Iron 57%
Eosinophils 997
 These were my only out of range results, everything else was in range including a1c.
 
Apart from going to see a doctor coming soon and given all this information, would statins be something I should consider, or do yall think my diet and supplement changes should be a significant enough change to really improve my numbers. I really appreciate any feedback!

I work in corporate sales and want to start a side hustle where I manage in-home injectables (Botox, filler). My corporate manager said her friend does this in SF.

Notes - This does not exist in my city. While there are plenty of medspas, I did not see anything on Google/Instagram of in home injectables. 

I would handle all client base, booking, marketing, payments, insurance. 

PA/Nurse would use her/his license to buy botox/filler and I‚Äôd schedule her/him for appts that fit their schedule.

Open questions for you all
-has anyone does this before? If some would love to PM you and buy you a virtual coffee!

- How much is wholesale botox per unit? I‚Äôve seen 6.50-8.50.

I‚Äôm hoping to give the living room a more modern feel, but I‚Äôm honestly not sure where to begin. The apartment is kind of dark, so ideally something that will help lighten it up a bit. Some friends suggested I add a rug, throw blankets or pillows, a coffee table, some plants, a nicer floor lamp, etc.‚Äîbut I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and unsure about what would actually work with what‚Äôs already there.

I'd love some help with layout ideas, color schemes, or small additions that can help elevate the space.

**üèÜ Best IPTV for Firestick & Android in 2025 (No Lag, No BS!)**

**Main Content**

Hey there, streamers! Sijar here, and let me tell you‚Äîfinding the *best IPTV service* in 2025 shouldn‚Äôt feel like defusing a bomb. You just want smooth streams, tons of *live TV channels*, and zero buffering, right? Well, after testing *way* too many *IPTV providers* (some great, some‚Ä¶ yikes), I‚Äôve got the inside scoop on which services actually deliver. No fluff, no hype‚Äîjust real talk.

# Why IPTV in 2025? (And Why Ditch Cable?)

Let‚Äôs be honest: cable TV feels like renting a VHS in the TikTok era. Why pay $100+/month for 300 channels when *the best IPTV subscriptions* give you **40,000+ channels**, *4K streaming*, and *PPV events* for a fraction of the cost? I switched three years ago and haven‚Äôt missed a single UFC fight since. Plus, with features like *catch-up TV* and *multi-screen support*, you can watch *Game of Thrones* reruns while the kids hog the TV with cartoons. Win-win.

**Pro Tip:** Pair your *IPTV service* with a *VPN* (like NordVPN) to dodge ISP throttling‚Äîespecially for *live sports streaming*.

# Conclusion

**Wrapping Up: Your Ticket to Seamless Streaming in 2025**

Well, friend, we‚Äôve covered *a lot*‚Äîfrom the **best IPTV services** to how to dodge those pesky buffering issues and even why **IPTV vs cable TV** might just be the debate of the decade. If you‚Äôre anything like me, you‚Äôve probably been burned before by sketchy **IPTV providers** promising the moon and delivering‚Ä¶ well, a pixelated mess. (Been there, suffered through that laggy UFC fight. Never again.)

But here‚Äôs the good news: **2025 is your year for no-BS, high-quality streaming**. Whether you‚Äôre after the **best IPTV for sports**, craving **4K streaming**, or need **international channels** to feel a little closer to home, the options we‚Äôve talked about‚Äîlike **IPTV GREAT, IPTV Unlock, and IPTVGang**‚Äîare legit game-changers. Seriously, imagine flipping through **130,000+ HD channels** without a single freeze. *Magic.*

**Why does this matter to you?** Because life‚Äôs too short for endless scrolling, unreliable streams, or missing the big game because your **IPTV service** decided to bail. With options like **anti-freeze tech, multi-screen support, and PVR catch-up**, you‚Äôre not just getting TV‚Äîyou‚Äôre getting control. And hey, who doesn‚Äôt love a **cheap IPTV service** that *doesn‚Äôt* sacrifice quality? (Spoiler: No one.)

**Here‚Äôs my takeaway for you:**

1. **Try before you commit**‚Äîmost top **IPTV providers** (like [IPTVGear](https://iptvgear.site/) or [IPTV GREAT](https://iptvgreat.me/)) offer **free trials in 2025**. Test-drive that flawless UFC stream or binge your favorite series guilt-free.
2. **Pair it with a VPN**‚Äîbecause safe streaming is smooth streaming.
3. **Ditch the cable clutter**‚Äîif you‚Äôre still on the fence about **IPTV vs cable**, remember: no contracts, no hardware, just *instant* access.

I‚Äôll leave you with this: A few months ago, I convinced my buddy to switch to **IPTV Unlock** ([check them here](https://iptvunlock.com/)). His response? *‚ÄúWhy did I waste years on cable?‚Äù* Point is, the **best IPTV subscription** isn‚Äôt just about channels‚Äîit‚Äôs about reclaiming your time (and sanity).

# Frequently Asked Questions

**1. What‚Äôs the best IPTV service for Firestick & Android in 2025?**  
Hands down, **IPTV GREAT** is my top pick. After three years of testing, it‚Äôs proven to be the most reliable for Firestick and Android, with **140,000+ channels**, zero buffering (thanks to AntiFreeze Tech), and killer support.

Most IPTV services operate in a gray area, but **IPTV GREAT**, **IPTVResale**, and **IPTV Unlock** are reputable providers with legit licensing for many channels. Red flags: *""Lifetime subscriptions for $20""* or no trial. Always check reviews (like this one!) and opt for services with transparent terms.

**3. Why does my IPTV keep buffering? How do I fix it?**  
Buffering‚Äôs usually from slow internet, server overload, or a crappy provider. Pro tips:

**5. Can I get IPTV in 4K? Or is that just marketing hype?**  
Some providers *do* offer real 4K‚Äî**IPTV GREAT** and **IPTV Unlock** have dedicated 4K sections for movies, sports, and docs. But watch out for fake ""4K"" labels. Always test with a free trial first.

**7. What‚Äôs the cheapest** ***good*** **IPTV service? Are budget options risky?**  
**IPTVResale** offers insane value (\~$10/month for 130,000+ channels), but *cheap* doesn‚Äôt mean *trash*. Avoid services under $5/month‚Äîthey‚Äôre usually scams or packed with buffering.

**8. Do I need a VPN for IPTV?**  
Not always, but it‚Äôs smart. A VPN (like ExpressVPN) hides your streaming from ISPs (who sometimes throttle IPTV traffic) and unlocks geo-blocked channels. **IPTV GREAT** even recommends it for extra security.

But even tho I never even got to have the option to serve a mission or not my entire family still holds that over my head as the reason I have so many medical issues and disabilities & why I have never been married was I wasn't a ""good and faithful servant"" (yeah sure it has absolutely nothing to do with me having to flee from DV!just a made up Gods punishment for me not paying TMFMC money I dont have!üôÑ)

All my Dr's know I'm LDS, was raised in the church and that up until now at least it's been an important part of my identity. But, I'm also o e of the statistics about how the church creates girls with severe eating disorders and I still often use the ""I'm fasting for church"" line to get out of eating or running tube feeds, so I kinda feel like a benefit of not telling anyone if I decide to leave or at minimum become inactive is being able to use my favorite 'fasting for church' excuses that the Dr's can't argue with. And also the not passing off my family which I 
would have spent many winter nights out on the street if  not for them so even tho they're extremely hostile and unsupported, I do need to kinda try to keep the peace as best as I'm able. Honestly the only time in my entire life I've ever experienced truly Christ like behavior from ANYONE was when a friend's ex boyfriend and his nondenominational Christian family took me in during college & vet school and even paid the huge bill for me to attend a eating disorder treatment program which the college made mandatory for me to be allowed to take my final exams to graduate. They were even nice enough to continue to let me live there during vet school, which was the only reason I was able to attend vet school. I've lost contact with them over the years but I wish I hadn't. They are definitely who I would have rather spent the holidays with even tho I constantly miss my mom and would walk across the country if I had to in order to get to hug her and hear her voice for even a minute. I've recently been working on accepting that I'm just never going to be good enough for her but t h I think it'll be a work in progress til the day I die and as part of that I'm trying to not make big life decisions based only on gaining their approval. I use cannabis products medically and don't follow the WOW which I don't advertise with them but they still call me an addict and treat me like one cuz a med I'm prescribed for literally debilitating chronic pain they Google and it said it's primary use is to treat substance use disorders and it's just much easier to get info from Dr Google than ask me questions about it and find out the truth but that's the type of people I'm dealing with. My dad was awesome when he wasn't in an abusive fit of rage but he's no longer alive. I have to see a therapist to try to process the abuse of all kinds I experienced not just from various family members but also people from the church & according to my nevermo therapist I'd be healthier and happier if I left but I'd like to hear some opinions from those who have experienced being in the church especially if you've left or just decided to become inactive. How do you meet people to socialize with or find ways to serve your neighbors and where or who do you turn to for help/support if you don't have the LDS church in your life? I do tremendously enjoy a good espresso or latte on occasion and I'm sure coffee would taste even more incredible served without the side of guilt!",4,1743636222.0,exmormon,2,1.0,False

1jq30yo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jq30yo,Just Launched a Tipping Platform That Plants Trees With Every Tip. Would Love Your Thoughts!,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm excited to announce the launch of **PlantYourTip**, a tipping platform that automatically channels part of each tip into planting trees. Imagine a creator‚Äôs ‚Äútip jar‚Äù or a coffee shop‚Äôs QR code, but every time someone sends a tip, a portion goes straight to verified reforestation efforts. It‚Äôs already live and ready for you to explore!

# Why We Built It

Online tipping (like Patreon or Ko-fi) is awesome, but we wanted to give it a deeper purpose. Instead of just sending money, why not tie every tip to something tangible, like reforestation? With PlantYourTip, each tip helps plant real trees through our partner, Ecologi.com.

# How It Works

1. **Create Your Tipping Page** Whether you‚Äôre an influencer, caf√© owner, or restaurant, it takes just minutes to get a personalized page on [PlantYourTip.com](https://plantyourtip.com/) (totally free).
2. **Share the Link/QR** Post it on your socials, in a YouTube description, or print a QR code for your shop or restaurant.
3. **Tip in ‚ÄòTree Units‚Äô** Tips are measured in ‚Äútree units,‚Äù so supporters know exactly how many trees they‚Äôre helping plant.
4. **Track Your Impact** Both you and your supporters can see the real-time impact‚Äîtrees planted through [Ecologi.com](http://Ecologi.com) are verified and easy to follow.

# What Sets Us Apart

* **Sustainability at the Core**: Every tip helps fund verified reforestation‚Äîno guesswork involved.
* **For Creators and Local Businesses**: Anyone can use it, from Twitch streamers to mom-and-pop coffee shops.

# We‚Äôre Live!

We‚Äôve officially rolled out our production version. A small transaction fee (about 5%) goes toward keeping the platform running and scaling our environmental impact. For a quick walkthrough, **check out this short video**: [YouTube Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJgSK-GdXxg).

# Looking for Feedback

* **Tried something similar?** Let me know what worked (and didn‚Äôt work) for you.
* **Marketing gurus**: Any tips on reaching creators, podcasters, small businesses, and caf√©s/restaurants?
* **User Experience**: Did you find the interface clear? Is setting up a page or scanning a QR code intuitive enough?

Thanks for checking out PlantYourTip! Feel free to poke around [PlantYourTip.com](https://plantyourtip.com/) and let me know your thoughts or questions. I appreciate any and all feedback. it‚Äôll help us grow and keep planting more trees.",1,1743636058.0,SideProject,0,1.0,False

1jq2zrt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComfortLevelPod/comments/1jq2zrt/aita_for_inviting_both_my_boyfriend_and_best/,AITA for inviting both my boyfriend and best friend to sleep at my place,"(Sorry in advance for my English, it's not my first language)
 I (21F) moved 3 years ago to a different region in my country to study, and after a couple month I became close friends with a girl from my university, let's call her J (21F). After a while I met some of her high-school friends including a guy, let's call him C (22M). The three of us often went out together, sometimes with other people too. At some point C told J that he had feelings for her, but she rejected him and they both decided to stay friends. At this point of the story me and C weren't really that close, we just went out in group sometimes but not really friends. That summer J also started to date another guy (and they are still together today). that year me and J started to know each other more, to the point where last year we started to have feelings for each other (at that point at least a year had pass from the time C had feelings for J, and he had already moved on). Anyway one thing led to another, and almost 9 month ago C and I became an actual couple. After two month of dating though, he went in erasmus in another country, but our relationship worked well even with the long distance and I went to visit almost every month for a couple of days (and when I couldn't go to him, he would come to me, and we would always split the cost of the ticket). This January C came back from the erasmus and we started to spend almost every free moment together. All this time I thought my friendship with J hadn't really changed, and to me it was the same as always. I still see J all the time in and outside of uni, we study together, go out etc, and I thought the C and J also kept their friendship as usual (they have known each other for like 6 years). Tuesday thought I invited J to come to sleep at my place to study and watch a movie and she said yes (that was the only day that she could), but Tuesday is also a day of the week when C generally comes to sleep at my place, cause is the only day that makes sense with our schedule, so I told C that he couldn't come, and he was kinda of sad but was fine with it. The three of us met at uni Tuesday at lunch, and since it had already happened in the past, C asked me if he could come stay at my place too  (i stay in a big room with a queen size bed and a couch that tourns into a bed -i dont know the name sorry). As I said this was something that we did a couple of times when we wanted to do a movie night, and it made more sense for them to just stay, then going home late, but it had happen just another time since me and C started dating. When he asked me I said that I thought it was fine, and I went to ask J , but she told me that it was going to be a problem for her and she rather go back home that night. I asked her why, and if something was wrong (I also told her that C could have slept in the couch-bed and me and her could sleep on my queen size bed), and she told me that last time we all slept at my place she found it awkward and uncomfortable, and she felt like a third weel. So I told her that if she found it uncomfortable it wasn't a problem and C didn't have to come that night, and it was just going to be the two of us. Later that night at my place I reopened the conversation again cause I wanted to understand more about J not being comfortable with me and C. I said I was sorry and I didn't mean to make her feel that way, and frankly I didn't even realise I did. I also told her that from my perspective our friendship (me+J and C+J) was the same as always so I didn't think it would have been a big deal if C had joined us, but that I was clearly wrong and I wanted to make things right. 
She told me that since me and C started dating we are always together, and rarely me and J just hang out like we used to do; She said that in general I'm less present in her life (wich I told her it has nothing to do with C and everything to do with my academic situation and the health of family members, all things that make me want to go out almost never, cause I'm just tired most of the time; the only reason this doesn't stop me from seeing C every day is that he makes the effort to come to my place and just keep me company; basically I told her that this isn't 
 the easiest time of my life, and she understood that).  She told me that she has the real problem with C, because they are basically not even friends anymore, they see each other only in social settings whenever I make plans with J (or in group with other friends) even though they live really close to each other (I'm a lot more distant), they don't see each other for coffee ect. She also said that when we are together, unless he is doing a joke, when C speaks he only looks at me, almost as it was having a conversation just with me (I haven't noticed that honestly, but maybe my opinion is kinda of biased). I basically told her that I could see her point but I'm not the person she has to speak to. I asked her how I should behave with what she told me and she said that I could tell C what she said, cause she had to speak to him anyway and I could explain in the mean time why he couldn't come to sleep at my place. 
Today I spoke to C about the situation and he told me that he saw what J meant too, but also we have been dating for 9 months, but 6 of those where long distance (and we basically had the capability to actually spend time together for just 3 months) and he wanted to make up for the lost time. Also he said that while he was on erasmus, J never contacted him, and they just grew apart a bit in that time.
They still have to talk to each other about that, but I don't really know how to act in this situation.
I honestly think i am kinda the asshole, and I'm just looking for advice (I don't want to ruin mine or my boyfriend's friendship).",2,1743635970.0,ComfortLevelPod,0,0.76,False

Ever sat down for the big game, movie night, or season finale‚Äîonly for your IPTV service to freeze, buffer, or straight-up disappear? Yeah, me too. And let me tell you, there‚Äôs nothing more frustrating than missing a knockout UFC punch or a last-minute goal because your stream decided to take a vacation mid-match.

I‚Äôm Sijar, and trust me, I‚Äôve been down the IPTV rabbit hole *way* too many times. From sketchy subscriptions that vanish after a week to pixelated streams that look like they‚Äôre from 2005, I‚Äôve seen it all. That‚Äôs why my team and I took one for the team and tested over 50 IPTV providers‚Äîso you don‚Äôt have to waste your time (or money) on duds.

But here‚Äôs the good news: After months of trial, error, and way too much coffee, we found the *real* gems‚Äîthe 5 IPTV services that actually deliver what they promise: no buffering, no sudden shutdowns, just smooth, high-quality streaming. And hey, some of them even throw in perks like catch-up TV, PVR, and 4K streams that‚Äôll make you wonder why you ever bothered with cable.

**So, what makes these stand out?** Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôve got the holy trinity: reliability, insane channel lineups (we‚Äôre talking 40,000+ channels for sports, movies, and even international content), and customer support that won‚Äôt ghost you. Oh, and did I mention *affordable*? Because who wants to pay cable prices in 2025?

Spoiler: **IPTV GREAT** has been crushing it for three years straight, with over 140,000 channels and 100,000+ VOD options. Then there‚Äôs **IPTV Unlock**‚Äîour 2025 top pick for no-nonsense, high-speed streaming.

# Main Content: We Tested 50+ IPTV Providers ‚Äì Here Are the 5 That Didn‚Äôt Buffer or Shut Down!

Hey there, fellow streamer!

If you're anything like me, you've probably spent way too much time Googling *""best IPTV service""* only to be bombarded with shady websites, fake reviews, and subscriptions that buffer more than they play. Well, guess what? I did the grunt work for you.

After testing **over 50 IPTV providers** (yes, *fifty*), I finally found the **top 5 services that actually work**‚Äîno buffering, no sudden shutdowns, just smooth, high-quality streaming. And trust me, separating the gems from the garbage wasn‚Äôt easy. I lost count of how many times I yelled at my screen because of frozen streams right during the climax of a big UFC fight or a Premier League match.

But hey, I survived the IPTV jungle so you don‚Äôt have to. Let‚Äôs dive in!

# How We Tested These IPTV Services

Before we get into the best IPTV providers, let‚Äôs talk about how we tested them‚Äîbecause not all reviews are created equal.

# Our Testing Criteria:

‚úî **Channel Selection** ‚Äì A solid mix of **live TV, sports, PPV events, and international channels**.

‚úî **Price** ‚Äì Affordable doesn‚Äôt mean cheap and unreliable.

Spoiler alert: Most IPTV services failed at least one (or all) of these tests. But these **five providers?** Absolute beasts.

Great question! After testing 50+ services, these 5 stood out because they *actually deliver* on their promises‚Äîno buffering, no sudden shutdowns, and rock-solid reliability. They also offer insane channel lineups (we‚Äôre talking 40,000+ for some), high-quality 4K streams, and features like catch-up TV and PVR. Plus, their customer support doesn‚Äôt ghost you (a rare find in the IPTV world).

**2. Are these IPTV services legal?**  
This one‚Äôs tricky. While some providers operate legally by licensing content (like **IPTV GREAT** and **IPTV Unlock**), others may host unlicensed streams. Always check a provider‚Äôs terms and local laws. I‚Äôd recommend sticking to services that are upfront about their licensing to avoid issues.

**3. Which IPTV service is best for sports and UFC/PPV events?**  
If sports are your jam, **IPTV GREAT** and **IPTVGang** are top picks. They offer 140,000+ and 45,000+ channels, respectively, including dedicated sports networks and reliable PPV streams. No more missing that knockout punch or last-minute goal!

**4. Do I need a VPN for IPTV streaming?**  
It‚Äôs a smart move, especially if you‚Äôre using a service with unverified content. A VPN (like NordVPN or ExpressVPN) keeps your streaming private and can help bypass ISP throttling. Some providers even recommend one for smoother streaming.

**5. What‚Äôs the best IPTV for Firestick, Android, or Smart TV?**  
All 5 recommended providers work flawlessly on Firestick, Android, and Smart TVs, but **IPTV Unlock** gets extra points for its user-friendly apps and setup guides. Just download their app, log in, and you‚Äôre good to go‚Äîno tech headaches!

**6. How do I avoid buffering with IPTV?**  
Buffering‚Äôs the worst, right? Here‚Äôs the fix:

* Use a wired Ethernet connection (Wi-Fi can be spotty).
* Pick a provider with ""AntiFreeze"" tech (like **IPTV GREAT**).
* Close background apps hogging bandwidth.
* A solid VPN can also help if your ISP throttles streams.

**7. Is there a cheap IPTV service that doesn‚Äôt sacrifice quality?**  
Absolutely! **IPTV Resale** offers low-cost plans without skimping on quality‚Äîthink 130,000+ HD channels and ""No Freeze"" tech. Just remember: dirt-cheap services often shut down or buffer nonstop, so aim for *affordable*, not *suspiciously cheap*.

**8. Can I get a free trial before committing?**  
Yep! Most top providers (including **IPTVGang** and **IPTV GREAT**) offer free trials or 24-hour passes. It‚Äôs the best way to test their reliability and channel lineup before dropping cash on a subscription.

**9. What‚Äôs the difference between IPTV and cable TV?**  
IPTV streams content over the internet (way more flexible!), while cable relies on physical infrastructure. IPTV wins for:

* **Price**: Often 1/10th the cost of cable.
* **Channel selection**: 40,000+ vs. cable‚Äôs limited packages.
* **Features**: Catch-up, PVR, and multi-screen support.

**10. Which IPTV has the best EPG guide and multi-screen support?**  
**IPTV GREAT** and **IPTVGang** shine here‚Äîboth offer detailed EPG (Electronic Program Guides) and let you watch on multiple devices at once. Perfect for households where everyone‚Äôs glued to different screens!

Drinkware companies start selling 2 or 3 different sizes of cups, made to a standard set by the FDA or some similar governing body. They can offer them in different colors, materials, etc. Customers buy these cups and bring them themselves. 

All restaurants/shops that serve drinks would offer different standard fills, ice amounts and obviously prices based on the cup size. They also are required to buy a standardized automatic cup washer to ensure the cups are sanitized before they're filled. The previously-mentioned standards would ensure all cups work with the washer. However, the restaurant/shop has the right to refuse cups that are damaged or otherwise unable to be cleaned with just the automatic washer. This means you have to at least keep your cup somewhat clean or else you might not be able to get your drink.",2,1743635645.0,CrazyIdeas,2,0.58,False

1jq2unf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jq2unf/my_condition_is_chronic_but_my_pettiness_is_iconic/,My Condition is Chronic but My Pettiness is Iconic,"Before getting into the tea I‚Äôd first like to say that I am absolutely delighted to have accidentally stumbled across Charlotte‚Äôs channel. Never in my life have I seen or heard someone that matches my chaos.

Now, onto the story!

I‚Äôve been single for over 10 years now and ya gurl is getting frustrated of being single, so what does she do? Join Bumble baby and try to find some of that sweet long term honey.

I match with this guy who we‚Äôll call Peter. Based on Peter‚Äôs profile he‚Äôs super cute and nice and we get to talking. One thing leads to another and we end up scheduling a coffee date. I end up getting sick and am praying for Zeus to strike me down, so I text Peter and ask if we can reschedule. He says yes and all is settled.

I finally get revived like the second coming of Christ and tell Peter that I‚Äôm feeling better. He says, ‚ÄúSweet! How about so and so day?‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúAye aye captain!‚Äù

A few days before the date goes by and we haven‚Äôt texted or anything - but he still ends up showing up to the date. He was a gentleman and bought my matcha (much to my dismay because I feel bad when someone even buys me a bottle of water) and himself a latte. Everything‚Äôs going seemingly great and I‚Äôm a little nervous cause I shake like a domesticated chihuahua in these situations. The date goes by, we hug each other and he takes off to go back home.

Days later after the date Peter texts me and says, ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt see this going anywhere romantically but I‚Äôd still love to be friends!‚Äù Fair enough because I didn‚Äôt see it going anywhere romantically either. I‚Äôm unable to drive safely after being diagnosed with epilepsy last year so it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to expect him to put in all the effort meeting up - it just wasn‚Äôt realistic.

A whole week goes by without any communication whatsoever after we decided to be friends. I make multiple attempts at a conversation, he either leaves me on read or doesn‚Äôt engage at all. I finally get fed up after awhile and text him, ‚ÄúLook man, I can‚Äôt keep on being the one putting in all the effort to keep this friendship going. I literally don‚Äôt know any more about you than I did when we originally matched. I get that life is busy and I empathize with that, but we should just leave things here.‚Äù

This is the part where I know for a fact I‚Äôve been binging too much of Queen Charlotte.

Peter leaves me on read like he‚Äôs done countless times before. I finally snap and my petty meter is going through the roof. I send him another text, ‚ÄúRead? Figures‚Äù then proceed to block his number and delete our chat history.

The icing on the cake? When we originally matched he said in his profile that he values ‚Äúmeaningful conversations‚Äù. Like sir, WHERE? Are they dressed like Waldo?? Cause I sure as hell don‚Äôt see them!

Anyway, I don‚Äôt blame him or think that he‚Äôs an entirely bad guy. I do genuinely wish him the best and hope that he finds what he‚Äôs looking for. But I also hope that instead of me Zeus hunts him down and gives him some of that zappy karma.

I forgot to mention that I did put in my Bumble profile that I have epilepsy and communicated to Peter before the coffee date that I couldn‚Äôt drive. He misconstrued it at first not completely understanding the situation but after I explained it to him he understood and said he was willing to meet up. I‚Äôm a painfully honest person and don‚Äôt want to lead anyone on so that‚Äôs why I get that kind of stuff out of the way from the get go.

I guess my question is, what am I doing wrong? Is there something in my approach that‚Äôs problematic that I‚Äôm not aware of?",2,1743635584.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

Each city has developed its own unique coffee identity based on history, immigration patterns, and local culture.

What fascinated me most was how different the scenes feel:

* **Los Angeles**: The most diverse coffee scene in America with 100+ independent roasters. Korean, Vietnamese and Turkish influences create a true multicultural coffee experience.
* **Seattle**: Beyond Starbucks' birthplace, it pioneered third-wave coffee culture with cafes like Push X Pull showcasing sophisticated brewing techniques.
* **New Orleans**: Chicory coffee tradition began during Civil War import restrictions and was popularized by Rose Nicaud, a formerly enslaved woman who sold it in the French Market.
* **Boston**: America's first coffeehouse opened here in 1676! Coffee consumption skyrocketed after the Boston Tea Party as a patriotic alternative to tea.
* **San Juan**: Puerto Rico's coffee traditions date back to Spanish colonial times, with cafes serving as important centers of cultural identity and community gathering.

2. Jason Neil, Tucker Three Tone, <EF> Jowo nib. [A2] $115

3. Vintage Waterman‚Äôs pen. I purchased this from ‚ÄúGoldnib‚Äù at a pen show recently. He called it a ‚Äúmarriage pen,‚Äù meaning the cap and body are from different models. The cap is from a Waterman‚Äôs Hundred Year pen and the body / nib is from a Waterman‚Äôs Commando pen. The nib is a 14K Ideal nib. It was sold as a flex but I‚Äôd describe it as semi-flex, at best. I had the nib ground a bit finer by Kirk Speer (it was putting down a lot of ink and bleeding through paper) and it‚Äôs pretty sharp now, but very enjoyable, IMO. Everything works perfectly. Lever system is great, recently fully restored, etc. Produces some fun line variation, as shown in writing sample. I only inked it with Waterman Serenity Blue. [D] for nib modifications and vintage-ness. $125

4. Sailor Pro Gear Slim Shikiori, Harvest Moon? (I‚Äôm not sure about the name). It didn‚Äôt come with a converter but I‚Äôll include one. <MF> [A2] $70

5. Analog Notes, Faraday Model. #6 Jowo nib <B>. The resin has a really beautiful glow to it. [A2] $100

6. Platinum #3776 Century, My Favorite Things, Coffee Jelly (limited edition). Includes all items from original purchase - box, ink bottle (Platinum Mixable Ink, Dark Syrup), cartridges, converter. 14K <F> nib. Inked once with the ink it came with and used occasionally since I got it a month or so ago, but rating [B] condition because it was actively in my collection for a bit and has very slight signs of use (micro scratches, etc). $250

7. Sailor x Hachimonjiya Kubozakura. 18K <MF> nib. Includes box, ink cartridges and converter. This pen is in like-new condition. (I have the same pen with a <F> nib and wanted to see which nib I preferred, so I inked it up once and did half a page of test writing.) [A2] for inking it. $450

8. Rickshaw Simple 6-Pen Roll, Miami print. Perfect condition, I apparently just don‚Äôt use things if it doesn‚Äôt allow me to immediately see my pens. $35

I tried journaling, lucid dreaming, melatonin, magnesium, and other supplements, I've tried everything, but I never remember my dreams.

It's been my wish to remember dreams for a few years now, I just want to have dreams of any kind, boring, vivid, nightmares, I just want to remember them and be able to write them down.


List of what I tried:
- Telling myself I'll remember the dream before I went to sleep
- Avoid caffeine (I don't drink coffee or energy drinks)
- Go to bed early
- Good sleep schedule
- Supplements
- Waking up without an alarm
- Lucid Dreaming 
- Going back to sleep after waking up for a few minutes
- Staying still after waking up 
- I've asked questions to myself about the dreams, but I remember nothing at all
- Dream Journal (It's empty as of now, had it for over a year)
- Waking up during a REM cycle
- Taking medication for stress before sleep
- Meditation
- Avoiding alcohol (I only drink on occasions)


It's everything I've tried over the years, without it helping even slightly, I just wake up and my mind is blank, there's nothing at all, it's just as I went to sleep a second ago, I don't recall anything.
And I wish I could dream, so if there's anyone that could help me, please, tell me what other things I could try.

In fact i really cant find anything from anyone weaning off over a period of time longer than 2 months from 1 cup of coffee. 

I did 2 cups down to 1 cup cold turkey and i didnt feel right for 3 months. it was brutal. My suspicion is thats how long it takes for the body to adjust, given thats about the time people say it takes them to feel normal too.

Going from 1 cup to nothing I chose to wean off using a reusable k-cup, micro gram scale, 100 disposable plastic condiment containers and ground regular and decaf coffee. 

I set myself up to gradually replace .1g of regular coffee with decaf coffee every day. My k-cup holds about 9.3g so this was effectively a 93 day wean. I asked chatgpt to give me the dates and regular coffee + decaf amount so I could follow along as I went, and spent a night measuring out every day's worth of coffee and decaf coffee in each condiment cup. Marking the date of each day on the condiment cups with a sharpie as i went along. That way when I woke up in the morning, i didnt have to think about it, i just cracked open the condiment cup for that day and poured it into the reusable k-cup.

I KNOW this sounds like a really long time to wean, but during that time i had TWO withdrawal headaches, and very little fatigue to deal with. I was still a functional human being the entire time, and it was FAR better than my experience going from 2 cups to 1 cold turkey. 

It's worth giving it a shot especially if you have tried cold turkey and relapsed already. If you have any questions feel free to ask - happy to answer for anyone who wants to quit this dreaded bean juice.",8,1743635090.0,decaf,3,1.0,False

1jq2m82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1jq2m82/food_poisoning_side_effects/,Food Poisoning side effects,"So I started semaglutide via RoHealthcare towards the end of January. My first month was 8 units at.25mg. I didn't really have any adverse effects from it. I then went on to my next dose, which was 15 units at .5mg, The first week, I had a little nausea, but nothing too severe, until the last shot. I took my shot on Wednesday and on Sunday. I got very sick. It started with rotten egg burps and bad gas. About an hour later, It was coming from both ends. I was miserable for about 12 to 15 hours. All I ate that morning was half of a breakfast burrito (Bacon, eggs, potatoes, and cheese), so I thought I got food poisoning and didn't associate the issue with my medication.  The next few days, I was very queasy but kept things light. The following Wednesday, I took my next shot, 30 units at .75mg. It was fine the first couple of days, but Sunday night after dinner, I burped and it was the rotten egg burps and gassy, and within an hour, I was back in the bathroom most of the night and most of the next day.  At this point, I knew it wasn't food poisoning the previous week, and I decided this is not for me. I can deal with some nausea and even a little diarrhea, but not so miserable that I cannot go to work. Now I am scared to death Sunday is going to be a repeat.  I am not taking any more shots and eating very easy-going food and just drinking water and a cup of coffee in the morning.  Has anyone else dealt with this?",1,1743634969.0,Semaglutide,3,1.0,False
1jq2m7c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jq2m7c/aita_for_going_non_contact_with_a_friend_after/,"AITA for going non contact with a ""friend"" after hearing what she said about me","Hi first time poster here and I wanted to start off by saying I personally think I'm in the right here but I feel I might be biased to my own side of the story I'm going to try tell both sides the best I can please excuse my grammar English isn't my main language 
I (19F) cut contact with my ""friend""(19F) who I'm going to call Alice (fake name for the sake of privacy) some backstory ""Alice"" didn't have many friends when I knew her, for reasons of her own doing she always acted a bit off,never giving full compliments when she gave them or being overly confident and cocky with herself to the point where people didn't know if she was joking or not, it was never huge things so i didnt really understand why people wouldnt be friends with her. I would always talk to her during lunch or between classes, I used to play soccer with her and we became somewhat friends im school and I sat beside her in our art class we never tked outside of school and we oy had twi classes together . I have a fairly short temper and I'm not going to suger coat it for the sake if making myself look better in this story I never shout or get properly angry at people unless they've done something overtly wrong but if someone says something off to me I will always call them out on it just to see if they realised they did something and if we can communicate so it can be resolved easily. Some more things that may be relevant ""Alice"" has a minor speech impediment we are both from the Ireland and have accents so you wouldn't notice it if you didn't have an accent. The speech impediment makes her sound slightly British when pronouncing some words I'm putting this detail in because she brings it up later. Both myself and ""Alice"" have delt with mental health problems in the past mine with insecurity and depression and her with insecurity from her speech. I've had a good few instances with Alice making rude comments to me before, looking back now more than I had thought. where the main ones started was a few weeks ago. I was in art with ""Alice"" and the other two girls at the table talking about our weekends it was a Wednesday so I would be going to dancing later that day and I had my hair tied out of my face in a slickback bun, ""Alice"" had been unusually quiet that morning buy I just assumed she was tired and went on with my conversation until she randomly butted in saying ""do you know what I would hate..."" and me responding "" what would you hate"" and ""Alice"" following up with "" if I had my hair tied back and my massive forehead was on diplay"" she said it while looking at me. I thought the comment was about me because I was the only one at the table with my hair tied up but I just went ""nice"" as I didn't know what else to say and went back to my previous conversation when she butted in again oozing right at me and saying ""do you know what else I would hate if I did my makeup and I didn't have any of it behind my ears and I was in a bun so everyone could see"" I was kind of taken aback and just asked her "" do I have makeup behind my ears"" to which she loudly laughed at and said ""no"". I got up and left the table and went to work at the back of the room because I had a small bit of hope that the comments weren't mentioned for me and I was going to give out to her about saying something so rude for no reason. Later that day I went to a coffee shop to study a small bit and I got a voice note from one of my very close friends saying she was just with ""Alice"" and ""Alice"" said and I quote ""oh my god I would k!ll myself if I looked like bee"". I was not going to let that go so I texted her these are some if our texts 
Me: did I do something to you
Her: no why x
Me : then why are you going around saying you would k!ll yourself if you looked like me 
Then she started sending me voice notes insed of texting. Moving completely away from the topic I was talking about and saying 
Her: well, you told me to shut up the other day when I was interrupting you which really pushed me over the edge because like, I really struggle with my speech and I felt like that as targeted at my speech like you don't understand I went to therapy for that, you don't understand the amount of mental health problems I have""
Me: ""Alice"" I completely understand that you have mental health problems I have my own mental health issues but that's not what this is about I'm sorry but can you stop trying to turn this on me""
Her: no you don't understand like your just trying to make everyone hate me like if you tell your friends about this I'm moving schools, is that what you want? You don't understand that things I've gone through from people like you. Like I've never even heard you compliment me and that hurts""
She proceeded to cry into the voice messages to the point where I had to ask her to just text me because she was just sobbing into the phone threatening to drop out if school if I told my friends what she said because they would ""attack her"" to whicker I responded "" I'm sorry but you can't expect me not to look for comfort from my friends when you've gone and said a horrible thing about me to my friend and your said because you didn't know we were close"" I ended up telling my friends because I know it shouldn't have but it really got to me as I ways have had massive insecurity about my looks and no matter how many compliments I get or how many times people say its all in my head it's always going to be there especially with ""Alice"" going and saying that I asked ""Alice"" to not speak to Me and she said she would just move art tables she hasn't spoken to me since but she constantly stares at me and gives me dirty looks which is fine because I really don't care anymore I'm way too drained from school.
