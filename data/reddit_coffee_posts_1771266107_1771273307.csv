1r6kerk,https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/comments/1r6kerk/bf_m24_thinks_i_f23_am_unloyal_due_to_past/,bf (m24) thinks i (f23) am unloyal due to past situations that caused insecurity and idk what to do,"I would describe our relationship as very intimate and raw, not speaking sexually, but in general. We rarely go a day without seeing each other and I basically live at his apartment now. We’re getting close to a year together. When he gets off work we lift at the gym and then spend the rest of the night gaming, making dinner, and spending time together.

However, throughout our relationship a few things have happened. I thought we worked through it, but I notice that now when anything minor happens, it blows out of proportion and either becomes a fight or he becomes distant and avoidant.

For example, very early into our relationship, we were at a gas station. He wanted to get pods for his vape, but because I was standing next to him and forgot to bring my ID in (even though I wasn’t the one buying?), the (male) employee wouldn’t let him buy it. My bf was getting angry at the employee, but I said it was okay and I’d get my ID from the car. I did that, the employee apologized, and I smiled and said it’s okay and to have a nice day. My bf got upset at me because I embarrassed him and didn’t defend him. This happened months ago, actually, within the first month of dating. But today he went to the gas station for pods again. The same employee was there, and my bf’s license was expired by a day. The manager said to just sell it to him anyways because he’s there nearly every day and they’ve seen his ID countless times, but the employee refused to sell it to him anyways. My bf texted me and said because I didn’t defend him back then and flirted (which I didn’t even know I did but I can understand the impression that smiling gave), he’s still getting the short end of the stick to this day.

Then there were a few other incidents. First, his friend at the gym asked me out on a date as a joke in front of my bf. I have audio processing issues related to my autism and genuinely did not hear. It was my fault that I didn’t ask him to repeat himself, but I just awkwardly laughed as a response. This came off to my bf as me accepting his invitation. I asked to set things straight with his friend, but he said no, so I never did. Months later his friend started working at the gym and made a nasty comment towards me, and was saying how he felt uncomfortable around me because I flirted with him, and that my bf’s own girlfriend is unloyal. My bf got upset at him and said some rude things, then the friend started physically assaulting him. He got fired, but bc my bf really started the verbal altercation, him and I were banned from the gym. He blames me for this too because none of this would have happened if I never put him in that position in the start when I unintentionally flirted.

Then at his basketball games, I would wear the same crop top every week because it was comfy and I liked how it looked on me. It would get hot in there so I’d typically take my sweatshirt off. I didn’t realize the timing of it typically only happened when his teammates were around, so they all thought I was trying to show myself off for attention. In reality I was not thinking of my body at all or the impression I was giving.

Then the time at the grocery store a male employee was flirting with me. I was oblivious to it. We were at self check out and he asked if I needed anything, I said I was good. He said to have a good night and I smiled and said thanks. My bf then told me the entire time the employee was flirting and smirking at him, and I was either doing it on purpose for the validation, or I was just painfully unaware.

Because of these situations, when things that I consider mundane happen, he becomes convinced I’m unfaithful. For example, I wore sweatpants to the gym with him. I told him i didn’t feel comfy wearing them because my panty lines showed, but the next day I found a pair of underwear that didn’t show through the pants so I wore them anyways. At one point when he was doing his set, I was standing there and raised my shirt for a second and pulled the pants up more to be higher waisted. He said I was trying to show off my ass. I cried and over explained myself, and honestly even denied at first because I had no idea I was even doing that. I wasn’t thinking about my outfit nor was I thinking of my body or any of the men around me. I was seriously thinking about what we had planned to do after the gym and that I was excited to be spending time with him.

And more recently, two things related to social media. I do not have anyone added that I would ever view as a threat to our relationship. The only guy I’m friends with is gay, and I don’t have ex talking stages or relationships added under any circumstances. But last weekend a random guy added me on snapchat. I asked my bf if he knew who it was because the only way I’d add a random person is if it was one of his friends. He said no. Then he pointed out that it didn’t say how he added me— didn’t say by quick add, mention, or search. I looked it up and that typically means they’re in your contacts or you gave your snap out personally to them. I absolutely NEVER DID THAT and I have no idea who the guy was, I did not have anyone by that name in my phone contacts nor would I ever give my snap out. But he didn’t believe me and we got into a fight about it.

Then after a family gathering yesterday, I noticed I accidentally put my phone on airplane mode. I undid it and looked at the notifications I missed in front of him, and a guy I went to high school with liked my instagram valentines day story of my bf and I. This high school guy is straight, and we were slightly friends in senior year of high school, but it was always very platonic and we only ever spoke in class. I had no idea why he liked my story and blocked him. We hadn’t had a real conversation in years aside from one time: I saw him one random day last year when I went to get coffee before work. He was working and asked how life has been since high school. I said good, I asked him back, he said the same thing, then I paid for my drinks and left and we hadn’t talked since. My bf said that there would be no reason a man would like my story if he wasn’t into me or if we never had anything romantic or sexual or flirty. He was under the impression I purposefully kept my phone on airplane mode and that I was lying/hiding things from him. I offered to let him look through my phone and he turned it down. For the next hour he laid in his bed as I stayed in the living room. When he walked out, he said he didn’t believe me and that these “wrong impressions” happen weekly at this point (the sweatpants, giving a wrong social impression, etc) that he knows it’s just going to happen again and I must be lying about something. He said my love is too much for him and it’s draining.

He then left again for another 45 minutes. He came back and we took an edible together and started doing some house chores. While we were folding laundry he told me we’re good because at the end of the day we’re together and that’s all that matters. I asked if he believed me and he said yes.

Then today this gas station thing happened. He told me through text when that thing happened with the employee that he’s just annoyed at a lot and it’s draining. That the things I did linger because they still have a lasting impact on him (being banned from a specific gym, that employee being a jerk to him today, losing his friend who got into that fight with him, etc). And that I made that employee feel above my bf therefore he treats him badly. That he’s just put into shit positions because of me and gets the short end of the stick. He said no more fighting or drama, just moving on with his day. But then that scares me because I don’t want him to just be piling things up internally until there’s eventually a blow up. He also said even with all of this, he shouldn’t be expected to be mad at me because I supposedly didn’t know what I was doing when I did it.

I’m constantly feeling guilty over these things I did in the past. I mentioned it earlier, but I’m autistic and have ADHD. I miss social cues sometimes, and because I don’t want to accidentally give a wrong impression, I don’t talk to anyone in public anymore. I say thank you with a blank facial expression when someone holds a door for me maybe. But I’m worried I won’t be able to tell if a man is being slightly too friendly (obviously I can tell if a random guy is giving me compliments or being touchy, just plain disrespect, but sometimes more subtle flirting can be hard for me to decipher). I’m constantly aware of what I wear, my facial expressions, my body language. This itself has frustrated him before, because when he runs into people be knows in public, I’m very quiet and he interprets it as me being uncomfortable around him or embarrassed to be with him. But in reality I’m just trying to read the social situation and how to act appropriately and not give off a wrong impression. But no matter what I do, I always mess up and do something that makes him think I’m talking to someone else or want validation/attention from others.

I’ve only ever had one relationship before this. It lasted 4 years and after it ended, I stayed fully single until I felt comfortable in myself and healed enough to ever date again. I didn’t flirt, I didn’t have talking stages, didn’t sleep with anyone, didn’t date at all for a year. Until I met my bf, I was just happy on my own. I don’t want anyone else, I have never been interested in anyone else, and I never would.

With that said, no matter the pureness of my intentions, I understand intention vs impact. And I obviously have left negative impacts. I will never deny it or minimize it.

I just don’t know what to do about it. I want to fix everything and build up trust again, because I promise, I have never and would never be unfaithful

But I feel like no matter what I do, how cautious I am, how much I’m trying to prove my loyalty, I always somehow upset and drain him again",0,1771272549.0,WhatShouldIDo,2,0.5,False

My life has been stuck in this loop.. work, pg, sleep, work, pg, sleep.. repeat. Because of my shift timings (night shift), my schedule is little messed up. Also to mention I'm not gonna stay here for long. 

My office is small with very limited people and whatsoever I prefer keeping work and personal life separate. So outside of work I genuinely don’t know anyone here.

And it gets lonely like really lonely.

I’m not a huge clubbing party every weekend type of person. I’m more into simple things.. good conversations, talks, random life discussions, sitting in a cafe and just talking about life. A genuine connection over loud spaces I can say.

Not looking for anything weird, not expecting anything, not promising anything either. Just two humans meeting for coffee, conversation to beat loneliness in this city.
If you’re in Hyderabad and feel the same way, maybe we can start with a text and see where it goes. I stay near ayyappa society.. Faaahhhh🗣️",5,1771272271.0,hyderabad,11,0.78,False

1r6k8ku,https://www.reddit.com/r/emptynesters/comments/1r6k8ku/what_do_you_not_miss_about_parenting_what_do_you/,What do you NOT miss about parenting? What do you LIKE about the empty nest?,"Okay fellow empty nesters, I can feel as empty, lost, purposeless, and grieving, at times, as much as all of you. It's really hard sometimes. I just don't think a lot of us were prepared for how brutal, sad, lonely this can be, at times. I had to move cross country from my kids so it's very hard. I feel like we are so disconnected from each other's lives and fear this will only worsen as time goes on. I didn't imagine things turning out like this. I did see two of my siblings pretty much leave my mom in the dust but I didn't think it would happen to me. One of my kids does call every week but the other one is more distant just very involved in their own life, world. That's fine. I understand and don't hold it against them. They are just trying to make their own way out there in this world.

Anyway, I thought maybe we could talk about the things that we DON'T miss about parenting from all the various stages of it. It wasn't all ponies and unicorns, that's for sure! Maybe it will help us just a little to realize there are some little bits of silver linings at least to this hard phase of life. There are some annoying things that at least we no longer have to deal with. I hope this isn't an annoying post. If so, I will delete in a day or two if it's an annoying, dud of a topic.

Alright, I will start with that I don't miss some of their friends. By high school, I felt annoyed by some of their friends like they were all about them and I was just this background servant character mom who would drive them places, serve them food, host them but I was invisible mom to some of them. You know teens can be self centered, all about them. Well, I felt that at times and resented being the eye roll 'your mom' person coming in the room with snacks, drinks, and cleaning up after them when they all would leave likely with me having to drive them all somewhere. Sometimes, this actually felt sad and oppressive to me. I had put so many years into my kids and sometimes when they were with their friends, I felt like some taken for granted indentured, used up servant to all of them and their fabulous exciting, on the cusp of onto bigger, better things lives.

I got the vibe from some of those kids they were used to being catered to their entire lives and I was there to be one more person to cater to them. It wasn't a good feeling for me. I could resent that.

I also don't miss dealing with some other kids' parents. I don't miss that really. With some of those parents, it felt like forced interactions with people that I really didn't care to have to deal with. There were a few parent cliques and I found that to be unpleasant to deal with as an adult.

I also really hated teaching them how to drive. I hated when they got their license and then off they went into the wild, real world driving with friends, at night, etc. It was actually super stressful and terrifying to me for awhile that they could get in a wreck.

One thing I do like about being an empty nester is mornings before work, on weekends having a few cups of coffee. It's nice to wake up and it's just about me. It's easy for me to get ready in the morning for work- shower, dash of makeup, dressed, coffee and internet for 30 minutes then in the car to listen to NPR or podcast. Easy, hassle free, relaxing start to the day compared to days when I had to get kids up, dressed, fed, backpacks and lunch or later get tired teens up and out the door to another drudgerous day of school. So yeah, I do like those quiet, calm, and easy morning starts to my day now.

Even though I am lonelier in ways, I do like the removal of some pretty heavy stress of raising my kids. When they were in high school, I was so worried for their future, where would they go to school, profession, future mate, etc. It could actually feel pretty heavily oppressive to me, at times, worrying about those things for them. I am getting older and it sure is nice to have a bit more energy to just focus on self and spouse and life does feel lighter, easier, less complicated in lots of ways.",3,1771272165.0,emptynesters,5,1.0,False

1r6k5ws,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6k5ws,A character of mine,"Simon Smith was born into a cult that worshiped ancient creatures from a shadow realm called Varujos (characters from the original game. I don’t know if they’re still Canon.) along with his brother Sammy after their mother volunteered to have a ritual performed on her where her unborn child would be the vessel of one of these creatures nine months later, when the ritual was performed something unexpected happen as little did the woman know she was carrying not one, but two children splitting the Varujos soul between the two babies. They were taken by the leader of the cult and also their biological father spencer Smith who had a daughter from another woman named Simone who trained them to use their split shadow magic to do horrible things to enemies at the Cults like assassinations getting information on enemies yada yada yada all that stuff basically trained to be child soldiers. When Simon turned 18 Spencer pulled some strings and managed to get him in the Queens elite program and for about two years he trained to eventually become a member and was given the title “ shadow” (I know the most original name there is) that’s when he met a young captain named Victor Vincent Ferdinand the second who coincidentally was dating his sister at the time so after some convincing from his sister, he managed to make Victor rise of the ranks, a lot faster, becoming supreme commander at only 39. He attended Simone and Victor’s wedding as the best man with his brother Sammy, who rose the ranks of the mafia eventually starting his own syndicate. Eventually, he himself got married and about six months after the wedding his wife discovered that she was pregnant, but unfortunately, both his child and his wife died during childbirth  causing him to fall into a deep depression and started to have second thoughts about being an assassin, finally knowing the pain of losing someone he loved .About five years after that, he was approached by Victor asking him to meet at a coffee shop where he had booked all the tables. Victor then told him his plan: to kill the 13-year-old prince Michael frame king p for the murder, putting the city under martial law making Victor the de facto ruler of the kingdom. Naturally, Simon was against this saying that he was going to report Victor straight to the council, but that’s when Victor pulled out pictures and evidence of Sammy committing robberies shootouts, and making people sleep with the fishes Simon held a knife over Victor‘s throat about to kill him when Victor revealed that he had given copies of the evidence to Martin McCauley, and if he died, Martin would give them to a secret assistant who would release them to the public. Now that his brother was at threat he cooperated with Victor though begrudgingly. Victor then told him what he needed to do sneak in to the young princes room, slit his throat and dump his body in the reservoir, which is exactly what he did, but when they dumped the body into the reservoir, Sammy spot of them and started striking up conversations eventually suggesting they go get drinks, but Sammy himself stayed behind. After drinking at the inn for a while Victor then came up to him and told him to kill a below average height vampire so he put on a disguise and tried to kill Milton before his friends showed up, including king p seeing that Milton was friends with the king he felt guilty because he knew what was going to happen so he just left and reappeared with Victor a while later. When P escaped after being accused of murder, he traced after him before he lost his trail. Couple of weeks later he tracked both Milton and p down at the inn arrested them but it wasn’t for long when Milton and p were granted bail by their friends. Sitting in his one bedroom apartment for about two hours an idea popped up in his head. He then made his way to the castle where Victor was residing and proposed a plan to taunt Milton and P by showing up to their karaoke fundraiser party along with bringing some music records for the party. After arriving at the party he volunteered to sing singing a made up song (it’s Cannon that he has a beautiful singing voice)before playing a record that he secretly recorded during the coffee shop revealing his and Victor‘s crimes, he then pulled out a shotgun from his trenchcoat and put it directly in his mouth, pulling the trigger, blowing his brains out. A note was then found in his coat pocket, confessing his crimes and why he did them. 

Note : I’ve been told that both Sammy and Simon are similar to a character named Wade by my brother. I did not even know who Wade was until a couple of months ago and Simon and Sammy have no relation to Wade whatsoever",3,1771272015.0,Globelore,0,1.0,False

The #1 feedback I’ve gotten from this community that the database is missing 90% of all hotels (I started with just 300 luxury hotels to kickstart the launch). Although I wasn’t going to add more hotels until about a month in, I decided instead to prioritize this update now. Thankfully, it was easier than expected to find a non-licensable + public/free/open-source database for this specific data that was also updated & good data.

PerkSnob.com now contains 8,945 hotels.

This is about 90% of all Marriott-owned hotels.

The 10% of missing hotels are mostly from the Luxury Collection, Tribute Portfolio, Autograph Collection, JW Marriott, and Design Hotels.

The second update part of this update is that 98% of all hotels now contain information including the number of rooms in each hotel, the direct email address to each property (requires an account that’s at least 7 days old), phone number, etc.

Let me know what you think and what else you’d like to see on this new platform. I plan to do 3 more updates based on any/all feedback here.",8,1771271879.0,marriott,1,1.0,False
1r6k2jy,https://i.redd.it/dwjmm50iwwjg1.jpeg,The Heiress's Endgame,"Chapter 1
Chapter 1

I spent two years in Switzerland recovering from an illness.

On my first day back in New York, my cousin Chloe threw a welcome home party for me in the Hamptons.

The guests were all the heirs and heiresses of the city's elite.

Long time no see.

The girls who used to hang on my every word were unusually quiet today, sitting in silence.

Even my younger half-brother, Vincent Vance, the heir to the Vance Empire who used to follow me around calling me ""Sister,"" treated me with a distant coldness.

At my own party, I, the guest of honor, was being given the cold shoulder.

A commotion erupted at the entrance.

Gabriel Sterling walked in, holding a woman's hand. The quiet banquet suddenly sizzled like water dropped into hot oil.

My brother was the first to jump up and welcome them.

""Gabe, Felicity, you guys finally made it.""

The heiresses who were stiff and silent a moment ago suddenly came alive. ""Felicity, come sit here!""

""We saved a seat just for you.""

The young woman surrounded by the crowd smiled brightly, her posture graceful and light.

Gabriel, standing beside her, looked at her with such tender eyes. They looked like the perfect couple.

If Gabriel wasn't my fiancé, I might even ship them.

My cousin Chloe, ever the gossip, leaned in and whispered, adding fuel to the fire.

""Cousin, see that? That woman was the stand-in they found. But she stood in for so long, she started thinking she was the main character.""

""If you came back any later, she'd probably be pregnant.""

Chloe and I grew up together. My aunt was lazy and often dumped her at our estate to be raised alongside me.

My mother couldn't say no to her sister, and fortunately, our family had the money to raise another child without blinking an eye.

Two months ago, Chloe sent me a photo.

In the photo, Gabriel was intimately holding a young woman who looked about fifty percent like me.

I heard this Felicity Quinn, a newfound daughter of the up-and-coming Quinn family, had been raised in the countryside.

She only returned to the New York social scene two years ago, right when I left for Switzerland.

At first, Felicity imitated my style and dress. Because she looked like me, she was mocked as a cheap copycat.

But later, the circle discovered that while she looked like me, her personality was gentle and submissive—the complete opposite of my arrogant, domineering reputation. Felicity was far more likable.

Besides being gentle, Felicity knew how to liven up a party.

Summer rafting trips, autumn fishing, winter skiing in Aspen.

She quickly became the core of the social circle.

My former minions gravitated toward her.

My brother Vincent, who initially despised her, eventually started treating her like a real sister, getting the warm sibling affection he never got from me.

Even my fiancé, the Sterling heir Gabriel, went from yelling at her not to copy me to looking at her with deep affection, as if she were his real fiancée.

Chloe, my real-time scout, sent me every detail. I couldn't feign ignorance even if I wanted to.

""Miss Quinn looks like me?""

I looked at her sharply.

Felicity trembled, habitually hiding behind Gabriel.

I scoffed. ""You all need to get your eyes checked. Where is the resemblance?""

Today, I wore a white cocktail dress.

Felicity also wore white. I wore a priceless pink diamond necklace. She wore pink pearls.

Felicity was indeed pretty.

But even wearing the same color and similar style, I didn't see the resemblance in our features.

My words silenced the room.

People glanced at each other, their expressions complicated.

Felicity was the first to react. Her face paled as she said unwillingly, ""Miss Vance is known as the most beautiful woman in New York. How could I deserve to be compared to you?""

The crowd frowned, displeased by her humility.

""Sister, looks are determined at birth. It's not Felicity's fault she looks like you. You demand to be unique in everything, but you can't take your anger out on an innocent person,"" Vincent said.

I almost laughed out loud. If I were truly taking my anger out, would any of you still be standing here?

""Idiot. Did you not realize I was insulting you?""

I was speaking to Vincent, but my gaze slowly swept over everyone present.

""Two years gone, and the Vance Princess's temper is still this bad?""

""We used to think they looked alike. Seeing them side by side, the sickly Miss Vance really can't compare to the rosy Felicity.""

""Miss Vance just has okay looks. But her personality...""

My temper is notorious. Everyone knows it.

My father once told me a woman should be like water—gentle and yielding.

But a flood is also water.

Rather than internalizing the stress, I prefer to burn others.

Watching these people, whose fake peace I shattered with one sentence, trembling in fear...

It was boring.

""You call this a welcome party? You all look at me like you're at a funeral, but you're all smiles for the irrelevant Miss Quinn.""

""Chloe, thanks for organizing this. But in the future, don't invite me to any event where these people are present.""

I grabbed my clutch, ready to leave.

As I passed Felicity, her best friend suddenly screamed.

She stumbled, and the gift box in her hand tilted. A massive white crystal geode slid out and smashed onto Felicity's foot. Her instep instantly turned red.

In an instant, Gabriel's roar filled my ears.

""Seraphina Vance, what are you doing!""

""Felicity spent ages finding this crystal geode for you! She thought it would purify your aura and help your health. If you didn't want it, fine, but why smash it?""

Gabriel and I grew up together.

He was the ""flower on the high cliff,"" cold to everyone.

Even on the day of our engagement, he was expressionless.

This was the first time I'd seen him so angry.

Right now, he was kneeling on the ground, checking Felicity's injury.

Confirming nothing was broken, he stood up and glared at me.

""Everyone came to welcome you back. But you? You spewed cold sarcasm and smashed a gift, making a scene.""

""Two years, and you haven't changed a bit.""

Slap.

A crisp sound echoed.

Gabriel finally shut up.

So much talking.

I relaxed my wrist and pulled back my bag. The metal studs on it had scraped Gabriel's shoulder.

The crowd watched the show, stunned.

Gabriel looked at me in disbelief.

""You hit me?""

I hit you. Do I need to pick a lucky date for it?

I sneered. ""You are still my fiancé. Defending another woman in front of me? Did you think I would tolerate this disrespect?""

I thought my temper had improved over the years abroad. Anger hurts the liver, after all.

If it were the old me, I would have started a brawl.

They seemed to have forgotten who I was.

Start trouble, get hit.

""Miss Vance, it's all my fault.""

""I... I didn't know the gift was so fragile. If I held it flat, it wouldn't have fallen.""

I laughed coldly. ""Of course it's your fault. Sending me a crystal? Do you think I'm some evil spirit that needs purifying?""

Felicity cried. A true beauty, her tears were pitiful.

While covering her face, I saw the corner of her mouth twitch upward.

Smiling for me to see. Only I could see it from this angle.

Gabriel's face darkened further.

He stopped rubbing his shoulder and turned to comfort Felicity, throwing harsh words at me. ""I didn't know you were so unreasonable.""

My brother also pointed at me. ""Sister, what did Felicity do wrong for you to treat her this way?""

""When I see Dad tonight, I'm definitely telling him to punish you!""

I laughed, waved my hand, and turned to leave.

""Go ahead and tattle.""

""And 'Sister Felicity'? Since when can any random cat or dog be your sister?""

""Oh right,"" I stopped and turned back. ""Gabriel, did you forget? Our engagement was something your father brought you to my house to beg for.""

""Since you like Felicity so much, I won't stand in your way. I agree to break the engagement. You can explain it to the Sterling family yourself.""

Might as well finish them all off.

I turned to Felicity. ""As for you, do I look stupid?""

""I have a bad temper, but I walk fast. I didn't even touch your friend. She dropped it herself to frame me.""

""Don't believe me?"" I pointed at the garden lamp. ""That surveillance camera should have a great angle.""

After my tirade, Vincent looked gloomy, Gabriel looked livid.

Felicity's face alternated between red and white.

The others looked uncomfortable.

They were unhappy, so I was happy.

I'm used to it. They gossip about me to my face or behind my back.

I'm not a masochist. If someone talks smack, I hit back.

""No need for you to tattle. I'll do it myself. I will send the footage of everyone's behavior today to the heads of your respective families.""

""This place has HD cameras everywhere. Your outfits, expressions,"" I waved my phone, ""and even what you said, are recorded clearly.""

Ignoring their panicked expressions, I turned to walk out.

I bumped straight into a man entering the garden.

Strong hands gripped my arms, steadying me.

I looked up into a flawless, devastatingly handsome face.

The man blushed and gently let go.

But I wasn't in the mood for eye candy. I pushed him away. ""Don't touch me. Move!""

Instantly, the man's face turned redder, pink spreading to his ears.

I frowned. Does this guy like being scolded?

""Cousin,"" Chloe said weakly. ""Let's go together.""

""Oh, ignore him. He likes getting yelled at.""

Does that kink exist?

He was so handsome; he must have a unique personality.

He felt familiar.

Seeing me look at him, the blushing man introduced himself. ""Miss Vance, hello. I am Julian Thorne.""

Thorne family? A second-tier family, a step below the Vances and Sterlings.

Before I could react, Julian shoved a gift box into my hands and ran away.

Sitting in the car, I was still confused.

""Julian Thorne? Have I met him?""

Chloe leaned back comfortably, tapping on her phone. An AI voice spoke:

""Julian Thorne, second-in-command of Thorne Corp, second son of the family head. Current net worth in the billions, potential inheritance hundreds of billions. Age 22, unmarried, height 6'2"". Size unknown, but estimated comparable to a water bottle...""

My face flushed. What kind of dirty AI is this?

""You don't know him? Had to use AI?""

""Uh, should I know him? It's my first time seeing him too.""

I looked at Chloe with amusement. Keep acting.

Chloe feigned ignorance. ""Cousin, why don't you see what he gave you?""

She quickly grabbed the box and unwrapped it.

When the packaging fell away, Chloe gasped.

She held up a velvet cushion displaying a glass-texture Imperial Jade bangle.

Such a bracelet was rare even at auctions.

I examined it and slid it on. It fit perfectly.

Chloe tutted. ""Cousin, you say you don't know him, but he knows your wrist size and taste perfectly.""

I turned my wrist, watching the emerald light flow within the jade, and smiled.

The party was unpleasant, but getting a perfect bracelet wasn't a bad haul.

Maybe the jade had a calming effect; I slept well that night.

I woke up early. After finishing my morning Pilates, it was barely 8 AM.

Once ready, I had my bodyguards go to The Cloud, the elite restaurant the circle frequented. They set up a massive screen at the entrance and looped the edited video from yesterday's party.

Felicity's fake fall, Gabriel's scolding, Vincent's rage. Everyone else was helpfully subtitled with their names and dialogue.

Passersby, customers, and internet sleuths uploaded it online. It went viral instantly.

The socialite WeChat groups were buzzing today.

A bunch of people tagged me, demanding to know what I meant.

I sent a ""smile"" emoji and left the group.

According to my assistant, the heirs tagged in the video were severely punished by their families when they got home.

After all, who gave them the guts to mock the Vance heiress to her face?

In the afternoon, Father called me to the study.

Vincent was standing straight by the coffee table, head down.

Seeing me, he glared and whispered, ""What are you doing here?""

I smiled, ignored him, walked to the sofa, and sat next to Father, acting sweet. ""Dad.""

Vincent continued his rant. ""What are you proud of? You just rely on Grandpa and Dad spoiling you.""

""Felicity grew up suffering in the countryside. You targeted her the moment you came back.""

Father patted my hand, then grabbed a book and threw it at Vincent.

""You helped outsiders mock your sister, and you have the nerve to speak? Get out!""

Vincent left the study unwillingly.

I watched the door close. ""Dad, are you really going to let him inherit the company?""

Father returned to his calm demeanor.

""Your brother lacks experience, and you're just causing trouble.""

He handed me the documents he was reading. It was a record of the insults from the other families involved today.

Just ugly words.

""These families all rely on the Vance family for scraps to live this good life, right?""

I handed a prepared folder to Father.

""Dogs that bite people should die. Dogs that bite their masters should be put down.""

With every page he turned, Father's face grew darker.

When he finished, he slammed the file on the table.

""Ingrates!""

The file detailed how several companies had blocked, price-gouged, and trapped Vance Group's overseas projects.

I was indeed in poor health.

But recovering abroad was half-true, half-false.

No one guards against a sickly non-heir.

While ostensibly recovering in Switzerland, I investigated the Vance family's overseas assets and hidden pitfalls.

There were plenty. And the culprits were the domestic families we had helped.

My biological mother died shortly after giving birth to me due to complications.

Father later married Linda from the Lane family, and they had Vincent.

Among the families conspiring against Vance Group was the Lane family. This made Father even angrier.

The Vance Group was meant to be handed to Vincent. But this son was so eager, he wanted to carve out chunks of the company now.

""The Lane family has sucked a lot of blood using Vincent's name these past few years.""

""Dad, can you bear to see the Vance Group become Lane property in the future?""

Father understood. But Vincent was his only son. He hesitated.

The company was still meant for him. Colluding with the Lanes wasn't enough to disown him completely.

""I'll think about it. You can go.""

Expected.

So I brought up breaking the engagement with Gabriel. Father agreed.

After all, Gabriel slapped the Vance family in the face. The Vance heiress didn't need to worry about finding a husband.

Worst case, I wouldn't marry and would just enjoy life.

A few days later, news of the broken engagement reached the Sterlings. Gabriel couldn't sit still.

When Gabriel stormed over to find me, I was having afternoon tea in the garden with Chloe.

Seeing Gabriel from afar, Chloe tried to bail. ""You guys chat, I have stuff to do.""

She retreated to the corridor, watching from a safe distance.

Gabriel didn't notice. He marched up and sat across from me. ""Seraphina, we need to talk.""

I was in a good mood, ignoring his rudeness. I pushed the teapot toward him.

""Talk about what?""

Gabriel's face was grim. ""Why did you break the engagement like that? My father scolded me because of it. Do you know what the rumors are saying?""

I leaned back comfortably.

""What could they say? That I'm arrogant and willful, unloved by my fiancé?""

""Or that Young Master Sterling is engaged to me but hangs out with Felicity all day?""

Mentioning Felicity, Gabriel thought I was jealous. ""Felicity and I are innocent. I just treat her as a friend I can talk to. Why break the engagement over jealousy?""",1,1771271813.0,NovelsSearch,0,1.0,False
1r6k2gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1r6k2gf/i_neurodivergent_was_a_charity_project_for_a/,"I (Neurodivergent) was a ""charity project"" for a parasitic friend who physically and financially abused me. It's been a year since I escaped.","**I’ve been sitting on this for over a year and now I’m finally ready to talk about it.**

**Everything I wrote here is completely accurate. I wish I was joking, exaggerating, or making any of this up.**

**\[Trigger Warning: Physical Abuse, Domestic Violence, Financial Exploitation, Gaslighting\]**

**TL;DR:** I am neurodivergent and have bipolar disorder. For over a year, my ""friend"" exploited my social awkwardness to use me as a personal ATM and chauffeur. She hit me, punched me while driving, forced me to apologize for her hitting me, and drained thousands of dollars from me while I was on welfare. I escaped a year ago.

I was with this person for over a year as my “friend”, and there are so many examples of how horrible she was to me. Enough to fill a whole movie, and chances are, I won’t be able to express enough of everything as I am not allowed enough characters. I just have to hope I will be allowed to post multiple times. What I am posting here is extremely truncated, and nowhere near enough examples.

To give a little backstory, I am very neurodivergent. Common sense to others is not the same as common sense to me. I’m very socially awkward. 

I’m very blunt, and while I always mean well, but lots of times things come out the wrong way in ways I didn’t mean (sometimes I try to say things that is different from what I was thinking and that just comes out wrong, etc.) I truly do care about other’s feelings, but sometimes I don’t know what to say, so I don’t say anything and that makes things worse. I am not violent, but I have been diagnosed with several mental disorders and I’ve heard I can come off as pretty weird, including having a mild Tourette’s where I mumble to myself and while I haven’t been officially diagnosed with this one, many people have stated (including some mental health professionals, and even her) that it is obvious I am on the spectrum. I struggle with depression and bipolar disorder, which sometimes makes it hard for me to trust my own judgment. She knew this and used it against me, calling me 'psychotic' whenever I tried to set a boundary, and telling me 'everyone hates you' because she knew that was my biggest fear.

I‘ve also been bullied my entire life by people claiming to be friends and it is very difficult for me to pick up on social cues. Because of these things, it has been very difficult for me to make and keep friends. I am also a people pleaser and try to avoid conflict.

I first met this “friend” from Bumble, and at first things seemed pretty nice, except she always wanted me to drive to her and her area and pick her up and drop her off, which is over 30 minutes away from me. 

Not long later she complained about how I was being selfish and inconsiderate of her, not giving enough, etc. even though I was always driving her. Since some of the things she complained about had some merit, I decided to change as I hoped she was helping me to become a better person, even though it was also clear she was beyond demanding, selfish, entitled, ungrateful and a user. She told everyone she was “helping me” to be a normal, better person, and made it sound like charity work.

She called me everyday as she drove home from work, and would always go on about how much everyone else hated/disliked me and how weird I am. She would also yell at me for not doing things enough to her liking and “not being a good friend”. I live on welfare and didn’t have a regular job. She had a decent paying job. However, since my parents would spot me on rent, she decided that meant I was rich and should buy everything for her since “she didn’t have anyone to support her”. There was even a month my parents weren’t able to enjoy their own social security because I was always taking care of her. Understandably, they cut me off after that and I only grew in debt, not necessarily because of her only, but she definitely didn’t help and only made things worse. 

It is very difficult for me to stand up for myself, but during the times I did, she would always interrupt me and yell at me and never let me finish my sentence, much less let me get my point across. I once tried to write a long text to explain myself and that I’m not a bad person like she always claimed I was. She showed it to everyone about “how psychotic” I am even though there was nothing bad written in it, because of how long it was, and went on about how I was not allowed to write her texts anymore taking away my best form of standing up for myself and to reason with her, as she never let me do that whenever I tried talking to her. I learned there was never any reasoning with her and to just do whatever she wanted, no matter how beyond demanding, selfish, entitled, and ungrateful she was. This went on for over a year. Eventually, when I did get a job, she expected me to treat her out more, even though I was already doing that way more often than she did for me (at least 5x as often BEFORE THE JOB), and she would go on about how it’s cause “I had more money”, even though I repeatedly told her that wasn’t the case. She would also go on about how I “wasn’t allowed” to mention I was on welfare, but she ALWAYS brought up how “nobody takes care of her”. 

One of the earliest red flags was that when I went out of my way to drive her to a Korean BBQ. We sat down and there was only 1 pair of tongs, which were next to her. Because they were next to her, I asked if she wanted to cook the meat. She complained the entire meal about how rude I was to want her to do that, how I need to pay for the meal now that she was “servicing” me, etc. I got fed up with it and said I could cook instead. She snatched the tongs away and went about how “I shouldn’t make a scene and should pay for the meal”. I tried to get another pair of tongs to help. She went on about how that since she “cooked”, I needed to pay for the entire meal, and I was “too selfish” to be fair and considerate of her, and it didn’t count at all that I drove us there. I ended up paying the bill just to shut her up. She still complained about it nonstop for days afterwards. 

She enjoys saying bad things about me to everyone she knows both in front of me and behind my back. She would tell me the things she has said about me herself. When I told her I didn’t like that she yelled at me “Then don’t be that way!” She yelled at me like crazy when I let slip once that I always drive her everywhere, going on about how gossip reflects only badly on me. She even told me how her other friends would complain saying, “Why do you hang out with her? She’s a bitch to you!”. None of them knew how horribly she treated me when we were alone, or the fact that I was always sacrificing so much for her and providing for her or how much everything was completely one sided.

For the entire time I have known her, I have always had to drive to her house to pick her up and drop her off. She refuses to drive at all, making every excuse not to. I have never seen the inside of her car, and she bought a newer nicer one while I knew her. She always criticized my driving and yelled and complained at me all the time for it. She never pitched in a penny for gas and always demanded I pump gas at the place next to her home (which cost $10 more per tank, arguing “it’s only $2”), because it was too uncomfortable and unreasonable for her to wait the lines at Costco, and “I need to learn to be a better friend”. 

She would repeatedly threaten to leave me and stop hanging out with me, always saying, “this is the last time”. It was obvious it was never going to be the last time considering I was always driving and providing for her. She would only give a half hearted “thanks” at best. Later on, she didn’t really say it at all. 

She enjoyed belittling me, demeaning me, and putting me down. She would always swear at me, even calling me a “stupid fucking bitch” whenever I wasn’t enough to her liking. One time I told her a story about how when I was in middle school, I used my allowance money to feed my family more than once. She went on about how all I was doing was giving back what I was being given, and it’s not like I gave my mom a kidney, and I was a bad person trying to manipulate her into thinking I am a better person than I really am, and made me regret telling her that story. If I complained about an ex, she went on about how I was not a good girlfriend because if I was, he would have come back for me. She has stated many times that even though I was ALWAYS going out of my way sacrificing for her doing all the giving while she was doing all the taking, I was not a nice person. 

I paid $100 for her birthday meal and gave her a gift that I thought was practical and admittedly cheap since I didn’t really have money. She complained to me about it for MONTHS, going on about how it was so worthless and cheap, threatening to give me a cheap, useless, worthless gift, only give me a $3 gift card since that was “how much it was worth” (it was worth more than that), etc. She demanded I buy her 2 makeup gifts if I wanted her to give me a decent gift for my birthday, so I relented. By the time my birthday rolled around she was HALF true to her word. She gave me a cheap, useless, worthless gift I didn’t like, and never bought me any make up gifts. I decided to be nice and give her the courtesy she never gave me, and say something nice about the gift and never complained about it, even though I didn’t like it. If I complained about a gift I didn’t like from someone else later, she’d say “it’s the thought that counts”. She never bought me a birthday meal of any kind. She also demanded I have my birthday party near where she lived, even though she was 30 minutes away from me and all my friends were (30 minutes or more) in the opposite direction. She went on about how if they were really my friends, they would make the drive out for me. She also wanted me to pick her up from her house and drop her off. Luckily, a mutual friend ended up joining us and was willing to drive her. That friend was also nice enough to pay the entire bill. I ended up not inviting my other friends as that would be too much for them and was going to do another party for them, but didn’t get around to it (admittedly my fault there). She later went on many times about how that was proof I have no friends and no one liked me. Aside from me, it was just her coworker, her coworker’s friend, and some guy she went on a date with a long time ago that showed up to her birthday party. The next day, she called me in the morning, and I was sleeping. At the time I had sleep issues where I could not sleep a regular schedule, it was very difficult to go to sleep at night and get up in the morning. She knew this. When I called her back a few hours later she said she was going to treat me for my birthday, but decided against it since I was “so rude” not to answer the phone in time. We hadn’t made any plans and I didn’t know or expect the call. I tried to explain she wasn’t being fair, but she didn’t care and never bought me a birthday meal. Even if she did, it would have been to Golden Corral, so she would have also spent significantly less. 

She always wanted me to buy things for her, even when I didn’t have money or it made me uncomfortable. In the extreme rare times she bought me something, I always ended up treating her again the same day and more than what she paid. There were many times I treated her and got nothing back.

She never bought any gift of any kind other than the cheap birthday one. She consistently called me a hypocrite knowing how much that hurt me, even though she proved many times to be a worse one.

She was a completely different person when we were alone vs in front of others, especially her (not as close) friends. She would seem nicer in public, but she was always criticizing, demeaning, screaming, swearing, even hitting me when we were alone. I tried asking her to stop hitting me. She yelled about how all she was doing was “tapping” me, “it doesn’t hurt when she does it”, “don’t be dramatic” when I said it hurt, and would act like I’m the rude one for wanting her to stop doing it. One time I tried doing it back to her so she could see how much it hurt. She hit me back even harder, so I tried back cause I didn’t like putting up with it. She PUNCHED me 3 extra times while I was DRIVING AT NIGHT and I had to stop doing it back cause I knew if I kept going, she would continue and worse. 

Several times she wanted to go to a casino an hour and a half away. We always ONLY spent MY money cause “we win more if it’s my money”, and she argued she should handle it cause “if I don’t trust her what kind of friendship do we have”. If we won, she would manipulate to split the winnings (she would also take a few dollars extra and think I didn’t notice), but if we lose the loss was 100% mine. No matter what, I would also ALWAYS be the one to pay for the meal and gas. One time I finally complained. It was very quietly and no one saw us. During the drive back she yelled at me for “making a scene” and how I was “so rude” and demanded I apologize to her. When I refused, she grabbed my phone from the GPS holder and rolled her window down dangling my phone threatening to throw it out in the middle of the desert unless I apologize to her. I was very concerned for my phone. So, I grabbed her phone as that was within reach, and I hoped if I had her phone, she won’t throw out my phone. I accidentally ended up breaking the cord of her phone case by doing that. She yelled at me for it later, going on about how I should apologize for that. She very likely told everyone I broke her phone cord for no reason. She later claimed she wasn’t actually going to throw my phone out the window, but I’m not sure I believe that.

I also went out of my way to literally drive her to Sacramento (she lives in Rowland Heights area), which is over 6 hours one way, 3 times. (I went there a total of 4 times, the first time her brother drove.) All of the trips were for her, and I was coming to help out. I didn’t know how much she expected. All 3 times, I was always driving her family around nonstop, and when I was at her mom’s house, she wanted me to do nonstop housework. This was very big the second time I was there as she was literally ONLY lounging around and barking orders at me to clean her mom’s house, but I put up with it without complaint to be nice. She only finally got up to help out after to sweep outside the house cause I was doing such a bad job. I was very annoyed given she never lifted a finger to help before that and was she was yelling and criticizing nonstop, but I didn’t say anything. She also yelled at me repeatedly afterwards for doing such a bad job that she had to sweep. For all 3 trips, I always paid for the meals to and back for both of us. She has paid for a grand total of ONE tank of gas for all 3 trips (1 tank total, not each). It takes at least 2 sometimes 3 for ONE trip, given I drive everyone nonstop. There was even a time in the 2nd trip when we stopped at a Macdonald’s. I was trying to get an app to work, but it was acting up. She grabbed my credit card from my hands and took it to pay the bill. She yelled at me for it later for not being considerate of her, and I was too cheap to be paying a bill. She also went on about how her mom was waiting and it was such a bad neighborhood. It wasn’t as urgent as she was making it out to be, the neighborhood doesn’t look that bad at all from first glance, but I don’t know the area.

The 3rd time was the worst. For whatever reason, I could not sleep the night before, (I tried), so while driving there, my body was shutting down and I could not for the life me of stay awake. She kept hitting me very hard every time to wake me up. I asked her to drive, she adamantly refused saying she wasn’t insured. She demanded coffee was enough. I know my body enough to know it wasn’t, and she refused to listen to reason. We went to a gas station to buy some coffee and she yelled at me for spending ”30 minutes” while her mom is waiting. It was more like 10, and only because I know if I don’t like it, I wouldn’t drink it, and I wanted to get something I would like. Sure enough, it didn’t work, and my body continued to shut down. She still refused to drive, so for 6 HOURS I had to put up with her hitting me harder than necessary to keep me awake. Throughout the trip, my body continued to shut down no matter the sleep I got (sometimes 7 hours), and every time I drove, I kept falling asleep. She nonstop yelled at me, demeaning and calling me names, and every time demanded I keep driving even though her nephew repeatedly offered to drive his own car, even arguing with him that I should drive. I didn’t say anything because she would scream at me if I did. When I brought it up later, she yelled at me anyway for “being stingy and selfish“ for wanting him to drive, and how “it’s too much for him because he is only 19”. She even KICKED me at her mom’s place because I sat in a chair that was in front of the Buddha statue and ”it was really disrespectful to Buddha“. I am Christian and didn’t know this. She said I did and she told me that last time I was there. That was months ago beforehand and she knows I have a bad memory. Truly don’t recall her ever telling me. Her mom, brother, and brother’s friend were in the room too, but their backs were turned and even if they did see, they would never admit it. She also yelled at me for ”being so selfish and stingy“ because I didn’t buy her 30+ person family a nice expensive meal, as “that’s what her other friends did before”. She claimed it would have only cost me $200. I don’t have $200 to spare, I was already going out of my way to help her. All 3 times, she had initially promised to pay for gas, but during the trip, went on about how if I was a really good friend, I would pay for gas too, and that’s what her other friends did before. After the trip was over, she gave a half hearted thanks (very likely cause her family told her to) along with more yelling and complaining of what a bad job I did, and how much I deserved it. All 3 trips were 100% for her. The 1st time, was a wedding aftermath (celebrating the wedding dinner for those who couldn’t make it to the wedding), the 2nd time for her sister’s makeup Buddhist funeral, and the 3rd time cause her mom was sick. The 2nd time, her mom gave me a couple of red envelopes for Chinese new year. She demanded on “checking” them cause she wanted to make sure her mom didn’t give me more than $20 “I didn’t deserve it”. I was just hoping her mom would reimburse me some gas money. Her mom ended up giving me $10 and $1. She was always bragging about how intelligent her mom is and how she is in better shape than most 40yr. She is in full capacity of all her mental faculties. I pointed out she is being a hypocrite always demanding I trust her for so much with bigger things, but still needed to look in my red envelopes was beyond weird. She went on about how I needed to be understanding of her as this was her mom, etc. even though her mom is very much sane and in full mental faculties. Obviously, she didn’t want me to have anything even though I continuously gave her way above and beyond what she gave me. On the 3rd trip, her nephew was with us most of the time, and he saw a watered down version of her nastiness, with her screaming, name calling, demeaning, demanding, etc. When they were out of the car and away a bit of a distance, I was supposed to be in my car and re-parking at the time, so they thought I couldn’t hear. He tried to ask her quietly and politely to be nicer to me. She shouted out loud, “I can’t help it! SHE’S SO STUPID!”. Obviously I immediately went back into the car as I didn’t want to hear more of her demeaning me. On a later day long after the trip was over, I pointed that out to her. She just looked at me very angry and disgusted for mentioning it and refused to apologize for it. She’s also refused to apologize for any time she shouts at me “stupid fucking bitch”, among other swearing and name calling. She also demanded I buy nice gifts for her family several times, which I went out of my way to do. I definitely spent way more money for these trips that were for her than she did. She even gave away my candy WITHOUT my consent. When she saw the look in my face, she went on about how “sharing is caring”, so I didn’t say anything because she would shout at me for being rude and selfish to her family later if I did. She would go on and say “the only reason anyone likes you is because of me”. When we were finally alone, she shouted at me for the horrible job I was doing, that “I was only there to chauffeur her family” and “I was a bad friend”. She never showed any gratitude, and as far as she is concerned, because her family fed me and gave me a place to stay, even giving me gifts they had around the house or clothes they got for free, I was more than compensated for all my labor. She claimed everything was worth more than it actually was.

She admits she is worse to me than her other friends. She knows about my mental illnesses and manipulates to sit in when I have phone calls with my therapist no matter how many times I tell her beforehand we need to leave earlier so I can be alone for my appointment. She has called me “psychotic” to me and to her other friends about me several times using my mental illnesses against me. She has never supported me in anything, always looking for a way to criticize me, or even to side with other people against me, and if there is no reason or way to criticize, she doesn’t say anything at all. Once before I told her I was concerned that when I went to do an Uber Eats run, even though I made sure it wouldn’t take extra time, a customer saw me throw away a drink container IN THE TRASH CAN, and that was probably why they didn’t tip me. The first thing she said was to go on about how littering is a $10K fine. Once I ended up selling something for $20, and I ended up saying I sold it too cheap and could have sold it for $50 (which is still lower than it’s worth). She went on about how I “shouldn’t be too greedy”. I’m usually the one spending money for her, almost never the other way around.

She would yell at me for logging my gas mileage which I need to do for tax purposes and my job (not just Uber Eats). She went on about how that is such an “invasion of privacy” and “so weird”. She refuses to even drive to the local shop to “protect her privacy” (which is less than 5 minutes away, only a few blocks, even less to her closest gas station) and demands I stop logging my driving all together to appease her. She has never driven a fraction for me at all ever. I point out to her that I have to log everything in order for it to apply. She doesn’t care at all. When I point out to her that she can drive, she yelled at me and said she shouldn’t have to and never would.

I unfortunately got into an accident and totaled my car (different situation), and I asked her ONE TIME to drive me to the salvage yard since I’ve given her rides so many times, and it was 30 minutes drive away. At first, she refused, and after I ended up figuring things out anyway. Then later, she called saying she got her coworker to drive and she was coming along to “talk to them” even though that part was unnecessary, and went on about how I “have to buy them Korean bbq” for the car ride. Even though I had pretty much figured it all out, since they already left, I agreed to go. At the time, it didn’t register to me how much Korean bbq really was, and I agreed because if I didn’t, she would yell at me for “being stingy, selfish, ungrateful, that’s why I have no friends, etc”. The meal cost me $153. She complained about it at least twice in front of her coworker about how it was unnecessary and a wasted trip even though I shouldn’t have to buy her such an expensive meal for a car ride, as I have given her hundreds of car rides for free, and an Uber would have been cheaper. She repeatedly complained even more about it later when we were alone. She never bought me any kind of meal for any of the 3 times I drove her to Sacramento. She later went on about how I had the money to pay for it because a friend gave me $200 when he found out I LOST MY CAR, and the money was to help me out for it. I found it disgusting she felt she was entitled to any of it, much less 75% of it, yet she acted like she was extremely generous to not demand all of it. She also went on about how she gave up a couple of her work hours for it. I give up my best Uber Eats job hours to her every weekend (both days) for free at her demands. She has never bought me a meal of any kind if she got money from anyone for anything (she hasn’t told me if she did to be fair).

She hasn’t kept her promises at times. One time, she wanted me to buy her a pasta meal in exchange for rearranging my room. She never kept that promise.

She wanted me to buy her a nice expensive meal when she cut my hair. I could not tell right away, and I even posted a picture that looked decent on Facebook, not realizing it was actually so bad I had to get it professionally fixed. The hairdresser asked me if I tried to cut it myself. When we were first hanging out, she would ask me to drive and promise to me a burrito as a thanks for me driving. She only did the first time, and every time afterwards made up an excuse not to blaming me for it. She wanted me to buy her 2 goodbye gifts before I left and promised me a great gift. She never gave me any goodbye gift at all.

She tells me all the time that people including her mother, are afraid for her safety with me because “I’m so weird”. I found that disturbing as I have never acted on or threatened any type of violence to anyone in front of any of them. Obviously none of them know how she treats me. In fact she even told me one of our mutual friends told her he would never sleep with me because I would claim I was raped. I never made any kind of wild accusation to any of them of that magnitude before. (Although I’ll admit I never wanted to sleep with him or give him and reason to believe I would want to.)

She always bosses me around, which I don’t like, but every time I stand up for myself, she yells at me and shuts it down. 

Very few people have seen a watered down version of how she treats me. Those people are nicer to me after having seen it. She was wise enough not to hit me in front of anyone.

One time right before I left, I picked her up to go to a place she told me about that was looking for a tenant near her area. She not only hit me for no reason beforehand, but right after I told her to stop hitting me, she got very angry and yelled at me to apologize to HER for saying she was hitting me. At first I refused as she was being messed up, but then she threatened to say many bad things about me to the landlord so he wouldn’t let me in, and I was scared she would do that, so I just went ahead and apologized to her even though it should have actually been the other way around. She immediately yelled, “APOLOGIZE AND MEAN IT!”, even though I had done it much like I had meant it already. You can imagine the look on my face after that. I told her I should record her. She said I shouldn’t threaten her.

Whenever we were with her friends (maybe 20% of the time), either I would pay, her friend, or we would all pay our own. The ONE time she paid for at least one other person was the day before I left. In fact, before that, she had promised she would buy me a very expensive sushi dinner the night before I left, and demanded I treat her 3 times before that, even though it not only added up to more than she said it would, and the fact that I have already treated her so many more times she would never be even. She ended up changing it at the last minute to a place that was cheaper than 1 of the 3 times I treated her before that. 

Even though we talked literally everyday and met up every weekend (both days), sometimes even Tuesdays, pretty much every time we went out was for her. She would say early on she was helping me to find a job, but we always did things for her afterwards, including me shopping for her and driving around. There was even one time she wanted me to drive to pick her up, buy her a bunch of groceries, and drop her off. She still wanted me to come and pick her up and drop her off even if all we were doing was hang out at my place. If we were doing what she wanted, I had to pay for my own ticket. The very few times we were about to do what I wanted, she demanded I pay her ticket. I’m also the one to pay for her movie tickets, etc. If I gave her something I got for free, it didn’t count as generosity. If she gave me something she got for free, it was an extreme act of generosity.

She is never there for me unless an expensive meal is involved, and even then, would only do easy things, like having her coworker drive, or cut my hair. She repeatedly makes excuses not to be there for anything harder than that.

For about a month before I was making my move to leave the state, she was already looking at Bumble to find a new best friend. Another mutual friend pointed out that it was weird I wasn’t even gone yet and she was already looking for my replacement.

We met up the night before I left the state at her request, and she didn’t want to talk about helping me move, which I told her would be the next morning. I didn’t want to be demanding, so I didn’t make any demands for her to be there, even though she always would with me (like the 3 times to Sacramento). The following day, my family and I worked all day for the move, and she called me at 2:30 PM. I didn’t answer as I was not only busy with the move, but I wasn’t in the mood to talk to her. Later on, others pointed out what a horrible friend she is for not being there, especially with all I have done for her. I tried talking to her about it later. She went on about how she didn’t know the time it was, and she tried calling. She never texted, and she waited well into the afternoon to call. I told her she should have come anyway, but she kept making excuses saying it might have been over. So she waited until she believed it was over to call. I almost never ask her to do anything for me, we always do things for her.

After I was gone, she called me a few times. She was nicer in these calls, and always spoke about “when I come back”. It was also in the last call when we talked about the moving thing. She likely told everyone how I’m so unreasonable to leave her for that alone. Honestly, I was already fed up for months and wanted it to end much sooner. After the last call, she tried calling me almost (if not actually) everyday, but I finally stopped answering. She didn’t call for a week then tried calling on a Saturday morning to my surprise. I finally did what I should have done much sooner and blocked her.

I didn’t calculate everything, but if I did, it would not surprise me if it added up to THOUSANDS that I have spent for her. It’s an extremely generous estimate to say she probably spent about $200 of her own money on me. If you count the meals others have paid by hanging out with both of us, things she got for free, things she bought for herself and decided she didn’t want, etc. it would be an extremely generous estimate to say maybe $500. There are so many other things I haven’t even gotten to, and some I forgot. Looking back, she is definitely the worst friend I ever had. The best part is she seriously believes she is the much better person. And everyone who has met us would probably take her side as she is usually a nice person to them as well as other people she meets. She is far more charismatic and I am far more antisocial. Especially with all the bad things she said about me all the time and I didn’t say bad things about her. She was only horrible to me. My social awkwardness only makes people more take her side as well. Along with how weird I am and how much everyone thinks I’m delusional.

1r6k2bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1r6k2bd/i_was_god_in_my_dreams/,I Was God in My Dreams,"I’ve always been a lucid dreamer, but it didn’t start as a gift. It started as an escape.

I was fourteen when my parents divorced. Their arguments had been constant, walls shaking, doors slamming, glass shattering. I learned to hide in the corners of my room, headphones blaring, trying not to notice the hollowness growing in my chest.

My mother moved out, my father retreated into work, and I was left in a fractured house that smelled of bleach and old coffee, echoing with absence. It wasn’t just the loneliness; it was the feeling that life was broken and that I was powerless to fix it.

That’s when I discovered lucid dreaming. The first time I realized I was aware inside a dream, I felt a surge of control I had never known. I could bend the world to my will. Anything I imagined, it would come true.

For the first time, I could create happiness, create worlds where pain didn’t exist, where I wasn’t an observer to suffering.

I was God.

At first, I started small.

I walked through forests that glowed in shades I had no names for. I could summon rainbows that arched across violet skies. I made friends in these worlds, creatures that spoke with humor and kindness, always ready to listen, always ready to understand. I relived moments of joy I hadn’t had, moments of safety and warmth that never existed in real life.

I even conjured, what I deemed perfect, my own home. The divorce never happened. The resentment my parents had in reality was hidden by the loving joy that I created.

We could be a family.

But it wasn’t enough. My control became more deliberate, more urgent.

I wasn't satisfied. I needed more.

I experimented.

I created cities that pulsed with light and sound, alive like music made manifest. I created beings who adapted to me, who grew and learned from me. I rewrote history, making impossible things happen, mountains sprouting overnight, rivers folding in impossible loops, stars that danced to the rhythm of my thoughts.

I was addicted.

As I built society further and further, I couldn't differentiate if it I was in reality or asleep. It didn't matter. I didn't want to wake up.

The more I created, the more my waking life seemed hollow, gray, insignificant.

What felt like days, even weeks, were merely only hours of sleep. I'd even mastered to bend my created beings with their own self thought. Their free will in my dreams. Oh how they dreamt and I, their God, could see their own dreams. Their own thoughts and ambitions.

Then I made a decision I will never forget.

I wanted to see what would happen if I stopped interfering, if I left my creations to their own devices. If I, their creator, were to disappear.

Within the dream, I closed my eyes and fell into a dream within a dream, drifting deeper than I ever had.

I left my creation running, untended, leaving it to course as it would without me.

At first, it seemed fine.

The sky remained impossibly vibrant. Oceans of liquid crystal rippled beneath my feet. Cities thrived, creatures and people roamed, oblivious to my absence. But subtle changes began. A tower leaned slightly, though I hadn’t touched it. A river hesitated mid-flow, as if uncertain where it wanted to go. The citizens paused, glancing around with expressions I had never taught them, curiosity, doubt, even impatience.

Then came the worse. A nightmare scenario.

The sky was red. And fire began.

I watched in shock as my world, that I have spent a millennia creating in my head burn. The people, the wildlife, the world itself ate itself.

Greed, hunger for power, the vial vines of corruption overtook my world, and I sat and watched.

What seem to be red liquid fell from the skies, putting and end to the flames.

When it was it over, I returned to my world, imagining that my presence would restore order. But the moment I stepped back, I realized it was already gone.

The survivors of my world looked at me with such anger. I could see how vile in their heart had become. Their being was split from me. From my control.

My world was no longer mine.

I awoke. The morning sun streamed through my curtains, but it felt alien. The apartment, familiar for so long, seemed different.

How long was I asleep?

Shadows stretched at impossible angles. The floorboards creaked where they never had. I told myself it was paranoia, that I had been dreaming too much, but deep down I knew something had changed. Something I had made had learned to exist without me.

That night, I returned.

I didn’t interfere. I simply watched.

The rivers were gone, the mountains were restless, buildings destroyed, and the citizens, my children, my creations, still tore at one another like a society that no longer needed its God.

And I realized, as I observed them, that I had indeed made a mistake.

The addictive thrill of creation, the power I had abused for joy and control, had given birth to something that might outlast me, something that might never remember me.

I woke, trembling. The air in my apartment felt heavy, as though weighted by expectation. I could almost hear the pulse of my dreamworld behind my eyelids, faint but insistent. A world I had built, one that no longer needed me, one that might thrive, change, and evolve beyond my comprehension.

I have not closed my eyes since. I fear what I might see. I fear what might remember me.

I fear that if I sleep again, I will discover a truth I cannot bear.

This alone is a lot of information, but a couple things to stick out to me:

***FanGraphs: No Nate George***

The Minooka Missile is essentially a top 100 prospect for every publication except for FanGraphs. 

As of the [2025 mid-season update](https://www.reddit.com/r/orioles/comments/1mclqas/longenhagenfg_partial_2025_org_prospects_update/), George got a bump to the 40 FV tier, fourth or fifth outfielder status. 

People have an urge to get these prospect analysts to argue with each other when the whole point is to get diverging opinions. EL has a very clear reason why he doesn’t have George rated higher, despite raw power, speed, and likely center fielder capability: 

[8/22/25:](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/eric-longenhagen-prospects-chat-8-22-25/)

>12:20 Nervous Flyball Pitcher: Any thoughts on recent Baltimore risers like Trey Gibson or Nate George? I saw George got the bump to 40 FV
>
>12:20 Eric A Longenhagen: Gibson you could argue is a 50, George’s contact profile is so oppo-driven it’s terrifying.

[8/29/25:](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/eric-longenhagen-prospects-chat-8-29-25/)

>1:12 Chadwick: Last week w/ Nate George you mentioned he’s all oppo as a concern. This question isn’t about him in particular, but just in general is that a concern about bat speed and catching higher velo or something else? Is Yohandy’s issue with going oppo you mentioned earlier in the chat the same thing?
>
>1:14 Eric A Longenhagen: It’s about “length to entry”, as in it takes his bat a while to get to a point where he’s able to pull the baseball, and it happens consistently. It’s a trait of players who later struggle to catch MLB velo at all
>
>1:14 Eric A Longenhagen: I’m not one of those “YOU GOTTA PULL [EVERYTHING]” guys, but I do think if you can’t pull it at all, I’m bothered by it

[10/24/25:](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/eric-longenhagen-prospects-chat-10-24/)

>12:22 Dan S.: Nate George is listed as the Orioles #38 prospect, but BA has him in the Top 100 overall (78). He was a 16th round pick out of a cold-weather HS but he did nothing but hit in his pro debut with elite speed and good CF [defense]. Is he a guy we should expect to see move up the FanGraphs list soon?
>
>12:22 Eric A Longenhagen: I tend to be skeptical of the guys who can’t turn on the ball at all. Looks like a speedy 5th OF to me.

Looking at his [batted ball profile](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/nathan-george/sa3067128/stats/batting#batted-ball), on the 2025 season he ran a 46.7% groundball rate, including 54.2% in high-A. The opposite field batted ball results skyrocketed from 29.4% at the complex (92 PA), to 38.5% in Delmarva (186 PA), to 49.2% in Aberdeen (92 PA).

Reading between the lines, the other publications simply don’t think his batted ball profile is a red flag. BP, for example, noted that his bat speed would imply better exit velocities than he’s getting, and that an adjustment of intent and more strength could be the key. In 2026, look for his pull fly ball rate.

***MLB, BA, ESPN, BP, FG: Yes Dylan Beavers***

Unless I’m mistaken, this is the first time Dylan Beavers has showed up on a pre-season list. What happened?

In the middle of a suddenly very good 2025, I asked BP lead prospect analyst Jeffrey Paternostro in a chat, is Beavers any good?

Transcribed:

>Paternostro: I like Dylan Beavers. I've always liked Dylan Beavers. It's kind of a tough fit because he's not a centerfielder and he's always looked awkward. It's like a tweener but a good tweener, I think he'll hit enough / get on base enough. […] 3-4 win corner OF if everything goes right even if the overall, you're not really seeing much more than 55s on the sheet. […]
>
>[…]
>
>Paternostro: I did some Beavers video because he was vaguely in midseason 50 consideration so some of it might just be context (?), but his actual data has always been fine, a little better than his numbers […] I did not see a major swing overhaul relative to what he does normally. […] All of his exits look about the same, everything is pretty much in line with his historical data here. It's like average-ish exits, good contact rate, doesn't chase. SEAGER score is fine  […] I kind of always thought he was a 55, I've always liked him, maybe more than the numbers.

Coincidentally, BP’s Jarrett Siedler [highlighted](https://bsky.app/profile/seidler.bsky.social/post/3mejbagylgk2t) a key quote from a FanGraphs interview with the [Cardinals AGM](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/cardinals-farm-director-rob-cerfolio-discusses-a-deep-st-louis-system/): 

>We’re not solving for Double-A performance. We’re solving for major league impact.

I think it’s important for us to remember that the guys in the minor leagues are a work in progress. It doesn’t mean you can’t draw conclusions from clear data, but it means there’s always information that you don’t have and you don’t necessarily know you don’t have. Going back to George, EL might not know for sure why George isn’t pulling the ball, but the only evidence he does have indicates that it could be a liability. Did Beavers have any obvious flaws before 2025? [Not really](https://i.imgur.com/Rf2qq86.png), he just never popped off the chart, right?

***Baseball Prospectus: No Luis De León***

I think with De León, you have two obvious lumps:

1 His present command is poor. There’s really no way around this. He doesn't have a single season where he averaged under 10% BB%, although it has linearly improved from 2023 (13.0%) to 2024 (12.2%) to 2025 (10.9%) against improving competition. If you just look at De León, you can see he’s a gangly guy who rarely repeats his delivery. It’s not hard to imagine him cleaning up the mechanics as time goes on, but currently he’s good to give you an unwatchable 4 walk game probably [every other month](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/luis-de-leon/sa3019283/game-log?position=P).  

2 He only has a 2SF, so he’s not throwing anything hard for whiffs. The pre-Arizona Fall League [report](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/welcome-to-the-2025-arizona-fall-league/) listed De León with a dead zone 4SF: 13.7 IVB and 12.3 HB. It’s no wonder he threw the pitch literally [one time](https://bsky.app/profile/scb5.bsky.social/post/3mbrzpl6ydk2i) in five games in Arizona. I think you can work around this, since there are very successful [lefty](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/framber-valdez-664285?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) sinker-heavy [guys](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/cristopher-sanchez-650911?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) in MLB, but those guys are also hitting like 99th percentile outcomes relative to where they were in the minors, you know?

Paternostro himself replied in the comments, “I like De [León] but he's always been very relieverish, so he's not quite fourth starter enough or close enough as a pen arm. The slider should work well in short bursts though.”

---

***The Athletic: Yes Wehiwa Aloy and Ike Irish***

This one’s simple: Keith Law at The Athletic is the only one who tagged 2025 draftees Aloy and Irish as top 100 guys. 

Lance Brozdowski did a recent video on top 100s (although I wish he had waited for BP and FG), and he pointed out that some analysts might be [deferring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-d3nfKYfZ4&t=1306s) on 2025 draftees. Not a definitive statement, but it does seem like it might be common for analysts to decline to make a called shot on someone who hasn’t had much time in the pros.

Aloy does not have a subtle prospect analysis: the latest in a long line of whiff-prone toolsheds, his path to the majors depends on being able to cut down on chase against spin. Law’s buying that, and while no other publication put him on their 100, BP did write, “You are likely going to have to live with some level of swing-and-miss going forward, but if Aloy shows an ability to get his power into game with wood bats and against better quality stuff, he should be something like a Kirkland brand Carson Williams as a prospect. And despite the latter’s struggles in the bigs last year, that’s a very good prospect.” 

I find it strange Irish showed up on this list despite Law saying two things against him: 

1 The org isn’t planning to put him behind the dish.

2 Negative feedback Law received from teams who passed on Irish in the draft and from pro scouts who saw him in Delmarva. **What the hell does that mean?**

I’m increasingly rounding down on guys who aren’t mashing before they get to AA, although you can at least say Aloy got to some real game power in his cup of coffee last year despite whiffing at a yellow if not red flag level.

***ESPN: Boston Bateman (???)***

This isn’t anything, I just found it interesting he was top 200 for McDaniel. I hope the Orioles are planning great things for him, because acquiring Boston Bateman in effect cost them Grayson Rodriguez…

---

***Notes***

Hopefully the mods take mercy on me, because some of these lists are paywalled, but I think we can agree that the rankings themselves are essentially public, and if I don’t post it, then someone in the press will. I tried to avoid copying and pasting too much from the scouting reports and paraphrasing. There's a *lot* of information I did not include that's in these writers' lists.

The average column is imperfect, because if a guy doesn’t show up on an org’s list at all, that isn’t counted against them (I thought about defaulting that to a 30, but each publication’s org list has a different number of players on it, so even that’s not standardized).

I declined to wait until MLB and FanGraphs posted their org lists, mostly because today is FG's top 100, which is imo the most significant list of the year, and I was curious how EL was going to judge Beavers, Gibson, and De León.

Understandably, the [FG top 100 chat](https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2026-top-100-prospects-chat/) was incredibly busy, and I didn't get either of my questions answered despite submitting them 10 minutes before the chat started. **Anyway, who wants to ask questions?** Hopefully some of this sub's luminaries will stop by answer them.",8,1771271389.0,orioles,4,0.83,False

1r6jutf,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1r6jutf/it_started_as_a_cuddle_between_best_friends/,It started as a cuddle between best friends,"I’ve had this one friend for basically my entire life. We grew up together, our parents were very good friends, we went to the same school most of our whole time growing up, we did similar activities, and we even had siblings the same age as one another who also did similar activities. We were around one another a lot. It wasn’t until high school that we became best friends. When we were younger it was more that we were just around one another and friendly but not something we sought out just that our lives were very interconnected. 

We had gone to different middle schools for two years and then met back up in high school and our friend groups happened to kind of merge together and we were once again around each other. This time though we were actively choosing to be friends and hang out. We became very close friends seeing each other regularly with our group of friends. There was never any kind of feelings on my part aside from brotherly or best friend who I would go the extra mile to make sure she was happy. But also, being brotherly would pick on her like any self respecting brother would. I had plenty of friends over the years say that they thought she had a thing for me but I never saw it and completely disagreed with their assessment. 

After high school we kept in contact despite going to separate schools in the same state but very far apart. Same with another one of our friends who we also considered our best friend. The three of us were extremely close and always will be. 

We also had another male friend who I only met in high a school but who became my best male friend along. The three of us were always hanging out. Classes, lunch, weekends, parties, whatever it was we would usually go together. I feel like I would see them every weekend. The two of them even dated for a while, which was weird but I love the both of them so I was always happy when they were together. When they broke up, being the awesome people they are, they stayed just as close of friends as before and it changed nothing in the friend dynamic.

After high school we all went to different colleges in the same state but not really close to one another. We would always try and see each other a couple times a year though and always if we were passing nearby. That trend continued throughout college and into our early working “adult” lives as we all stuck relatively close to where we each had gone to school. 

One day when we are probably in our mid-20s our male friend invited us up to his place for a weekend hangout with him and his now longtime girlfriend and offered us their place to stay so we didn’t even need to get hotel rooms. Which was great because despite having actual jobs and income none of us were super flush and still kinda lived like college students on a budget. We locked in the plans and met up when the weekend finally came. 

When I finally get there, the drive was long but I was so relieved to finally get to hang out with them all for a fun weekend and it had probably been about a year since I had last seen them. I knock and my male friend, James, opens the door and I can see our female friend, Amanda, on the couch behind him. 

James is a tall guy and always had a few extra pounds on him. He had dirty blond hair sort of wavy and untamed but never in an unkempt kind of way. He wore glasses and was just kind of an average guy. I of course think he is a good looking dude because he’s my best friend, but would probably rate out at a 6 or so. I’m so bad at ranking people and what other think is attractive. He had been working out a lot though and he had lost a ton of weight but still he was tall so he just carried more than most people. 

I gave him a huge hug and he invited me in and set my luggage aside in the entry way of the apartment. Amanda got up and came to give me a hug also. She is a little above average height for a girl but was also on the bigger side. She had a longer face a bit puffy with lots of freckles. She has straight blonde hair that she never kept too long but usually a bit beyond her shoulders. Being a bigger girl she has enormous boobs which were always fun to stare at a bit. In terms of attractiveness she is probably only about a 5 if not a 4. Both of them are just as big of geeks as I am and both incredibly smart. 

Being my first time at his apartment he offered me a quick show of the place. It was an average 1 bed 1 bath apartment with an actually good size living room. It was a nice enough place but nothing flashy. Amanda and I would be on the futon, I told you basically college kids still, and neither of us had a problem with it. We got done with the tour as quickly as you would imagine and James said his girlfriend would be home in about an hour and then we could all go to dinner. 

We hung out and were just catching up on everything in life when his gf gets back looking exhausted. We had met her many times before and was a super cool girl and James and her were incredible together. She knew everything about us as his friends including that he and Amanda used to date. She also had no hint of jealousy and had become decent friends with the both of us as well. We went to dinner at some local spot and had some more fun while out. Just being best friends and having a grand time. 

We make our way back and on the way pick up some booze for the apartment. A little mini party with the four of us. We get back and unload everything and start to make some drinks. Now Amanda has never been a drinker. She never really liked the taste of anything and if she was going to drink it had to have very little alcohol, be nearly unable to taste it , unable to smell it, and usually be very fruity or blended. James, his gf, and I however didn’t have those same requirements. So as we had done before a lot of our night was spent talking, playing some games, and trying to find a drink Amanda would like. Each one she said no to the three of us would take turns drinking. Every once in a while she would get one she didn’t like but didn’t loath and could stomach so she would drink it. 

The night went along and James gf got a bit too drunk so went to bed earlier while the three of us stayed up a bit later hanging out with a movie on in the background while we wound down. James finally hit his point and was gonna go crash and Amanda and I both agreed it was probably time. We got ready for bed while James made the futon for us and provided blankets and pillows. We said our good nights and got into bed. 

I have always been a bit of an active sleeper. I don’t sleep all too well as it is but have also know I like to cuddle up when someone else is in bed with me. I have many times initiated sex with partners from basically a full sleep. I have a few other stories, not written yet, about such times even. Now as I said I am not attracted to Amanda and she has only ever been an extremely close friend but given my sleep habits I wasn’t sure if I would do anything. We had also been drinking so that was another wild card in the mix.

As we are laying there I struggled a bit to find sleep despite the late hour and booze. I was tossing and turning a bit trying to get comfortable and find sleep while trying to not wake Amanda. Eventually, however, I had turned a bit and was cuddling into Amanda. I was by no means drunk but was definitely feeling it. Nor was Amanda drunk since she probably only had about the equivalent of a shot and a half and like 2 beers. I opened my eyes and it was still pitch black in the apartment so the middle of the night. It couldn’t have been but like 30 minutes after we laid down. 

When I rolled onto my side facing her she was on her back. My face basically went into her neck with one arm partially trapped under me and between her and the other on my side. My fingers however were touching her, unintentionally but also not something I was going to move. It wasn’t sexual in any way just an arm trying to be comfortable and happening to make contact with her. 

For whatever reason though as I was laying there my mind started to race and as it did I started to get sexual thoughts and that touch turned into a little more in my mind. I could feel myself starting to get hard. Not wanting to have it pressed against her and having no idea how she would react I rolled onto my back and away from her. I was probably only like that for a minute before she scooted closer to me grabbed my hand and rolled to her side putting us in a full on spoon position. Now my erection is placed directly against her ass. Not only that, but when she grabbed my hand and turned us she placed it right on her giant tits. I can feel her directly. All she has on is a t-shirt but certainly no bra as I can feel her nipple on the other side of the fabric. 

I sat there frozen. My heart was pounding and mind was frantic. I had never pictured her this was before but now I couldn’t stop. My cock was aching it was so hard craving touch all of a sudden. I was panicking thinking about everything that this position could be. She could clearly feel my cock on her ass cheeks I was pressed right up against her. I could clearly feel her tits as she placed my hand there. I decided that my best move was to do nothing. We sat there for a while until I started to get uncomfortable again. I also wasn’t sure if this was intentionally or just a reaction to my shifting away. So I shifted again not completely away from her but just rolling onto my back while still right up against her. 

Right as I did however she rolled over and once again grabbed my hand and put me back to spooning her and hand on her tits. This time though she draped her arm over mine locking me in essentially. Now I knew this was intentional. It got my mind going even faster with scenarios of what I would do and what I wanted to do. I sat there again heart pounding and trying to plan out how to proceed. 

I thought what if I kissed her neck? Or how about if I just sat there waiting to see what she did. Why not give her tits a squeeze, she did put my hand there after all? What if I return the favor and put her hand on my dick? What if I wait and see if she makes a move and then if she does it’s completely on? If any of this happens what happens with our friendship and on our other friends futon nonetheless. My mind was racing with possibilities all while I can feel my pulse in my dick against her ass. Almost involuntarily as I’m playing these possibilities my hand somewhat twitches and full on grabs a handful of her tit. 

I sit frozen again unsure of what is going to happen. Nothing does though. Now I am somewhat emboldened and begin to grab at her tit feeling it. While the first was probably subconsciously me grabbing her, these were now fully driven by me. I made a few more grabs and I can feel her breathing change. Not quite as shallow and erratic as I think mine was but she was certainly awake and enjoying the touch. 

Finally after about a minute of my pawing at her tits I feel her make a move. Her arm which was draped over mine slowly creeps backward. She slides it back between us as she shift a little making the slightest gap between our bodies. Her hand slowly finds its way to my crotch. Her hand directly on my raging hard on and he hand gently  tightens around it over the top of my shorts. 

It feels electric honestly. We have known each other for like 20 years or so and now her we are my hand on her tits and hers on my dick. We are fully in the grasp of the moment. Neither of us moves aside from one arm each. I am now pinching at her nipple hearing little gasps as I do. She is gripping and releasing my dick over my shorts. I want to feel those tits directly though and begin to work my hand under her shirt. As I begin to lift her shirt and get under it I feel her hand moving to the top of my shorts and under the waistband. She slips her way under my shorts and now has me firmly in her grasp. I let out a breath that I seemed to have been holding in. 

Eagerly I get my hand under her shirt and begin to pinch her now hard nips rolling them between my fingers feeling her breath getting shorter and shorter with light gasp moans escaping her as I do. She begins to jerk me in a slight stuttering motion stopping and starting like the angle is tough and the constriction of my shorts and underwear too difficult. 

It feels incredible. All the memories of us growing up have gone out the window and it is just lustful now. I don’t even think of it as too sexual just two animals greedily grabbing one another exploring something they haven’t experienced in the other. 

As she is stroking me slowly almost edging me I want to even the field. She has my dick, only fair I get her pussy. I slide my hand down slowly and similar to her I begin touching her over her shorts. She has on just some normal thin sleep shorts and I can easily find her slit over the top of them. Ensuring I have the right spot I press in a bit and can feel her wetness through the fabric already. She obviously had been having some of the same thoughts I was and possibly felt my dick poking at her a lot earlier than I thought she had.

I start rubbing the fabric of her shorts into her slit enjoying the wetness of it and how turned on she was before I begin to rub her clit for a little. As soon as the contact is made she let out a very audible but short moan. She caught it mid air and stifled it seemingly aware of our friends in their room and not wanting to wake them up either. I couldn’t help but grin like a fool at this light touch sending an electric pulse through her to get that reaction. It made me want more. It was at that moment I realized we had no condoms and didn’t know where they were in the apartment. I didn’t know if she had any but it would have been weird if she did given it was a friends hangout weekend. 

I snapped out of the thought quickly and decided it was probably better to not fuck and change things but it didn’t mean I couldn’t be in the here and now enjoying this handy I was getting. I also wanted to get a little more from her and if this touch over her shorts did that, could I short circuit her by full on fingering her?

I moved my hand up to her stomach and reached for the elastic on her waistband making my way under it. As soon as I made it under I could feel her full bush, no landscaping at all just all natural. As I proceed beyond it down to my goal with her other hand she stops mine in its tracks. I can feel her shake her head no and pulls my hand back up out from under her shorts. 

During the exchange she had stopped stroking me and I thought that was to be it. We sat there my dick in her hand with her other hand on top of mine on her stomach. We were frozen unsure if we should still continue. It was very sobering from the lust only seconds before. Suddenly her hand on my dick starts stroking again. It resumed the shallow motion it had been before but was picking up pace. She was full jacking me off now. I moved my hand back up under her shirt and began playing with her boobs again. I could feel this edging she had been doing to me building up again but now she showed no signs of slowing or stopping. She wanted me to nut and I was hungry for it too. 

As I am getting closer I softly grunt in my throat and squeeze her tit a couple times in rhythm hopefully signaling to her that I am about to cum and she again goes quicker to urge the cum from my cock. My body goes rigid and I begin to shoot inside my shorts with her hand wrapped around me. I clamp down on her tits as I roll through a few jolts of my orgasm. She had all but stopped her motion as I was cumming but now gave me a few aftercare strokes almost as if saying “good boy” before removing her now cum covered hand. We laid there for a breath before she tossed the blanket off her and got up to go to the bathroom. I hear the toilet flush then the water running and she comes back and lays down again. 

I can feel the mess in my shorts and couldn’t possibly sleep like that so I took my turn in the bathroom and cleaned myself up enough so I would be able to get to sleep. I get back and lay down balls fully emptied and feeling wonderful in the afterglow. I laid back and found sleep very shortly later. 

When I woke up the next morning she was already up and having coffee with James and his gf and they offered me a cup. We sat there drinking our coffee and chatting about the day and our plans for it. Not a single mention or glance between me and Amanda about our night time fun. In fact nothing has ever been mentioned about it to this day. We remain incredible friends who do our best to still see each other despite busy lives and many hundreds of miles apart. Nothing else ever has happened nor do I think it ever will. I don’t even think I have a desire for it to either. But we will always have that one night on our friends futon where we did have a bit of fun together. ",1,1771271333.0,confessions,1,0.67,False

1r6js50,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1r6js50/calories_in_calories_out/,"Calories in, calories out","I started my weight loss journey about four months ago. I’ve been working really hard in terms of getting better stamina for running and doing other exercise while also sticking to a pretty religious diet. My day goes a little something like this, for breakfast. I have a bowl of low sugar oatmeal with three tbsp of PB fit, and then a coffee that’s one part coffee, one part a scoop of zero sugar protein powder, and one cup of oat milk that’s unsweetened. For lunch, I usually have a quest protein bar with some combination of vegetables and chicken, sometimes in the form of a frozen meal, and then for dinner, I will have something that’s also pretty low-calorie. Throughout the day I like to include one of the Atkins protein shakes, and some kind of fruit like an apple or a banana. Overall, though, my intake is really low in terms of calories, but I feel fine and I’ve lost about 30 pounds, and I wanna lose another 20 or So.

My question here is that is this sustainable? I’ve read on some weight-loss forms and asked ChatGPT about how having too low of a calorie intake will end up messing up my long-term weight loss goals because my body will adjust and I’ll be doing more harm than good. I take a multivitamin as well just to make sure I get all my macros, but I have healthy carbs throughout the day, I like to have fish and avocado at least once a day as well so between that I’m getting my healthy fats and more protein any advice would be appreciated. Should I restructure and get something else in my diet? I can afford the things I’ve listed just fine and I run 2-3 5ks a week and before each run I make sure to have half a banana and a spoonful of regular peanut butter and I feel really good and then afterwards I will have some kind of a protein heavy meal with some carbohydrates just to make sure I’ve made up for what I burned off running.

\*edit\* I’m 5’11 and I started at 262 and I’m 235 now. Idk if that helps. I also run at least one mile everyday if not more. I started that in October.",0,1771271171.0,loseit,7,0.5,False

passed 12th in 2022 and smh got 84.4% without studying ""jee specific"" so i decided to take a drop. after a year's prep,  again got 84.4%. there were reasons, not worth discussing.

tier 3 college. today i work with the top AI labs, us/china/home companies, earn decent (projecting 3.86L this month), decent social following and skills. working from home on my own terms, without bs meetings. there's a lot more but i hope this is enough to convince.

i believe i did some things right in life that you can copy paste and optimise your future. here's an unordered list:

\- spend some time on choosing the right college. make a linkedin acc and start sending DMs to all seniors of all the colleges near you that you'll get with your marks. i was from delhi so i made sure to DM 2-3 seniors of each branch of each IPU college. 

\- avoid going college. with the right research, i took admission in a college that has 0 attendance policy. i haven't attended college since jan 2025. zero backs. was allowed to give all exams. 8.41 cg.

\- the world is changing rapidly. every day, every hour counts and you can't waste your time in commuting home - college. so if possible become a day scholar, especially if you're living in a big city. if you're not living in a big city - move to one ASAP. delhi/blr/hyd/pune/mumbai.

\- ignore societies in college. they are not worth putting the time and effort in. ""how will i learn social skills?"" download dating apps or go to meetups.

\- don't study for college exams. i never studied for exams. write long answers, make diagrams and you'll be fine. this is if you have some cs knowledge like me.

\- drink black coffee. see you will have to sacrifice some sleep. if X works for 12 hours and Y works for 16 hours. Y will mog X any day. iq/intelligence doesn't matter. you can outperform everyone if you're consistent with efforts. coffee will help.

\- ignore seniors and campus placements. if you want to make it big you will have to sacrifice everything your chunni lal college offers.

\- learn cs + programming ASAP. idk how but quickly learn web dev. the logic is you can make your own apps or offer services and start making money. don't get stuck in learning hell or berozgari trap. ignore DSA and CP. i don't like it and own't recommend.

\- make content. i'm active on linkedin, twitter, instagram and got all my gigs from twitter. my highest is 8.5L in a month and i got it all from twitter.

\- leave friends -\_-. this might sound !good but for some time you can just focus on yourself and keep dosti yaari aside. trust me when you'll be on a better strata in life you'll find better people, good ones from past, and more sukoon in life than living with mediocre friends.

i can't remember anymore. i'll edit. i'm open to questions. i don't answer generic DMs or people who've lost hope though.

it's not over. it will never be over. i have an interview for a senior role in a chinese company tomorrow. if an idiot like me can make it. you too can.",3,1771271076.0,JEENEETards,2,0.8,False

I spent weeks checking out websites, different possible locations, looking for what might feel right. I was over at my friend's place last week and his apartment setting looks simple yet classy, more like something I would love  to recreate at my own place. I have a really cool place, but it didn’t really suit my kind of person so  I have been putting in personal touches to make it feel like home. I am one who strongly believes that every space in a home should be tailored to meet a specific kind of aura, aesthetics and theme.
I have curated a separate set of decor for my room, kitchen, bathroom, sitting room and even laundry room. The apartment I got, comes with a little balcony just outside the sitting room door. I have been brainstorming on what to do, to make that little space a bit more comfortable for afternoon tea or a short meet and greet space.
Asides seeing a variety of furniture options on Alibaba and Amazon. I decided at the last minute of my shopping, that a  2meter long patch of artificial grass would be the perfect cover for the entire balcony floor to give it a cozy feeling in addition to the coffee table and chairs that I purchased, picturing it in my head its been turning out perfectly, hopefully recreating it wouldn’t be so bad.

1r6jnkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hilton/comments/1r6jnkb/review_of_hilton_waikoloa_village/,Review of Hilton Waikoloa Village,"First time on the Big Island and stayed at the Hilton Waikoloa Village (Palace Tower) for 3 nights in February. Just some quick thoughts while they’re fresh on my mind; I’ll start with big things and work my way down to little details.

1) Geography: The Big Island is an adventurer’s dream. It takes about 6-8 hours to drive around the outside of it, and there are unlimited places of interest to check out (beaches, waterfalls, fun restaurants). Does this mean that plopping down in a single resort for your whole stay is a bit silly? Yes, I would agree with that…if I were to do the Big Island again, I would just do an Airbnb, rent a car, and explore. You CAN do that while staying at Hilton Waikoloa, but you’re paying $350/night plus $48/day for parking which is not exactly efficient.

2) Resort Property: The #1 most striking thing about the property is that it’s ENORMOUS. There are 4 separate buildings that are each a solid 5 minute walk from each other. Going from one end to the other takes a solid 20 minutes walk. I’m a runner and enjoy walking, and even I felt the walking was a bit tedious. If you don’t like walking, stay in the Makai building. Makai has all the main restaurants and pools and is unfortunately on one end of the resort. The resort has a built-in tram and water taxi system, but both were out of order for our stay, which seems common. 

3) Facilities: The property has an unreal amount of Hawaiian artwork lining the hallways and sprinkled around the property. Seemingly hundreds of statues and vases everywhere with a bit of an Asian/Buddhist theme to the art which was very cool IMO. Another striking feature is the built-in lagoon that connects to the ocean and runs along the resort. It’s perfect for snorkeling and paddle boarding. There are sea turtles in it and some fish to check out. Not an ultimate snorkeling experience, but definitely the most convenient. Next, I must mention the dolphins that are on the property. There were about 10 of them in their pen, and it’s simultaneously insanely cool get such a close view of them but also a little bit depressing to see them in such a confined area. There are always a few dolphin trainers nearby keeping them stimulated, but yeah…understandably a controversial concept.

4) Restaurants: The food is pretty pricey but decent. Lattes are $8-11 (first time I’ve seen the $10 barrier broken), fish tacos/sandwiches/burgers are in the $25 range, wine is $17 or so, etc. If the quality was low, then I’d be extremely irritated, but at least it’s acceptable quality. You CAN walk 20-25 minutes on a residential sidewalk to the shopping center nearby as an alternative. There’s a shuttle provided as well for $5 but be prepared it runs closer to island time than anything super snappy. If you’re Hilton Diamond/Gold, note that the coffee and the Dole Whip place do NOT qualify for the F&B credit, but the other restaurants do.

5) Service: Honestly pretty good! The coffee place had a long line in the morning but the ladies running the drinks were elite speed. Lunch at Lagoon Grill was quick and snappy. The front desk was welcoming and pleasant. Honestly 10/10 for everyone except a special not-so-good review of the Salon desk employee. My gf tried to get her hair done one afternoon, only to discover the hair dresser walked out for the day a few hours before closing. The excuse was there were no appts scheduled but then why not say by-appt only? Zero sympathy either from the desk rep. Apparently this is run by a third-party, non-Hilton company, but still they need to do better.

6) Rooms: The Palace Tower is recently renovated and we were pleased with our room. Spacious, clean, modern, comfortable. You COULD hear sounds from neighboring rooms but it was not an issue to me.

7) Kids: This place is swarming with kids. Thankfully the property’s sheer size mitigates the impact, but it needs to be said that this is a factor for the childfree guests.

TL;DR Had a very good time overall. The resort is well-run and delivers solid value. My honest recommendation is to rent a car and explore the Big Island from a simpler accommodation, but if you’re looking to do the resort thing, then this place does its job well.",2,1771270891.0,Hilton,1,1.0,False
1r6jncl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/comments/1r6jncl/suffering_and_terrified/,Suffering and terrified,"I'm in my early 40s, and I've lived with fibromyalgia for a good 20 years. I've managed it ok. Until early 2021, I was working full-time, exercising regularly, gardening, and going out on occasional trips.   
  
In September, I took a long-term substitute teaching position to cover some gaps in my business income. Around Thanksgiving, I started feeling more tired than usual. Brain fog hit hard, my vision got blurry, and I had trouble keeping up with grades and lesson prep. I also misheard things people were trying to tell me many, many times. My spouse and kids especially noticed.

By Christmas break, it was clear I wouldn't be able to keep teaching full-time. So when a former client rehired my business in January for regular services, I resigned. I also saw my eye doctor and got my prescription updated, which solved 95% of the vision problem. But...

I feel like I'm still deteriorating. I'm struggling to put in more than 2-3 hours per day of paid work. Whenever I have to answer an email or make a phone call, my anxiety spikes through the roof. I had bloodwork done at the end of December, which shows I'm anemic and pre-diabetic. Even though I've lost 18 lbs since last spring, have cut back on my sugar, am not overweight, and now eat mostly whole foods, my A1c continues to climb, along with my blood pressure. I make myself exercise, but I don't want to do anything. By the time I shower and have my first cup of coffee in the morning, I feel completely exhausted. Every time a situation comes up that seems the least bit difficult, I want to check out. In many cases, I have dropped my usual obligations or stopped responding altogether. I just can't seem to make enough headroom to recover from whatever is going on with me.   
  
I've also been having random, intense (but thankfully infrequent) cramps in my lower abdomen. They almost feel like birth contractions. When I experience them, I double over and have to sit down.

I'm terrified that something is really freaking wrong with me. I'm trying to schedule the appropriate medical tests despite the 1) crippling phone anxiety and 2) years of disappointment in medical care. Anyone experience anything like this?",10,1771270878.0,Fibromyalgia,4,1.0,False

I haven’t described anything too explicitly, but trigger warning for mention of emotional abuse and mention of sexual abuse of a child.

I don’t think my friends are on Reddit, but using fake names just in case.

 

I (25F) have been friends with Drake (29M) and Josh (36M) for about four years, Drake and I worked in Josh’s restaurant. After the restaurant closed at the end of 2021, we became close friends, going for coffee or workouts in a park near us or going out for drinks multiple times a week. We kept this up for a while and were often nicknamed the three musketeers for how close all three of us were. If only two of us were out for drinks, acquaintances would ask where the third person was and why they weren’t with us.

This might be relevant to understand how everyone knows everyone: we live in a fairly small city (population of just under 250K, not in the US), so especially within the hospitality industry a lot of us know one another.

 

The real issue starts at the end of 2024. For the majority of the friendship we would often go out drinking together, but late 2024 I tried cutting down on my drinking, I’d already cut down on drugs (which they would still do) and I couldn’t manage being out so late anymore, so from then on we started seeing each other a little bit less.

 

It all got a lot worse in December of 2024, when I started a new job, working for a friend who I found out afterwards was a dickhead. I started working in this restaurant as the manager, trying to get the place back on track, fix the toxic work environment and the routine of staff getting wasted on free booze (shouldn’t have been free). Obviously, I took on a lot here and it didn’t work.

Drake, Josh and I saw each other less during this time, they weren’t very supportive of the friendship, let alone me working in his restaurant. Through the restaurant I got back into contact with Manny (37M), who was the manager of a different restaurant. Throughout the months of November and December we’d been seeing more of each other as friends, until in January he made a move and we got together. Manny was someone Drake, Josh and I all knew from the restaurant he worked in and just seeing him out and about during late nights.

The relationship with Manny went really fast, I stayed over at his place two nights in a row, slept at home for one, then didn’t leave for 6 months until I left him for good. It felt okay, so I thought it was okay. I did not realise he was pushing and manipulating me to stay.

When I told Drake and Josh about the relationship they were surprised, but happy for me. Manny was always known to be a bit weird, but mostly incredibly friendly and fun, loved to go drink and party, not a bad guy to have around. Drake and Josh supported me, or so I thought.

I saw the boys less and less and spent most of my time with Manny. When I left him – in haste, in the middle of the night – I was devastated. It would be too much to describe the whole situation here, but he ended up breaking my trust multiple times and wouldn’t talk to me about anything and eventually I was just fed up with it.

Now, a few weeks after I left Manny, I met someone he’d hooked up with about a year earlier, who told me a story about him that directly contradicted what he’d told me about her. She told me more things that didn’t add up, made me think more about what this man had actually been like in our relationship. Memories upon memories came flooding back and I realised he had lied to me about just about everything. When I say everything, I mean everything: his ex-wife, his daughter, his finances, his house, his friends, his family, deaths, holidays, work, his drinking, drugs. Fucking everything. Stuff that wasn’t relevant to any part of the relationship or was so important that if he’d told me the truth, I wouldn’t have wanted to be with him from the start. He never loved me, never cared about me, didn't care when I had a panic attack, told me I was annoying when I was struggling at work, didn't care when I lost our pregnancy.

 It turned out he had manipulated and lied to me from the start of our friendship, not even just the relationship. I found out he was a pathological liar and a narcissist, that he had been emotionally abusing me for months and to top it all off, I suddenly started remembering odd situations around him and his daughter (F3) that I would walk into after having been out of the house. He had (most likely, we still sadly haven’t been able to 100% prove it) been sexually abusing his own fucking daughter.

I broke. Fully broke. But I was honest, I was open, I talked about it, because I needed to talk about it. I got into contact with Manny’s ex-wife, with whom I’ve been in contact ever since, we talk regularly, but when contact started we put our stories together and realized something needed to be done to keep Manny from being alone with his daughter. I had to file a report with the child protective services in my country and she would add her stories onto it. Because Josh’s fiancée works in a similar sort of service, I wanted to get some info before filing the report, so I called him to ask if his fiancée would be willing to speak to me about this situation. I didn't tell Josh any details, only the gist of why I had to file. I ended up filing the report without talking to his fiancee. 

Onto the real issue that I want advice on:

Two weeks ago I sent a message to the group chat I have with Drake and Josh. I wanted to let them know honestly that in the last +- year I felt a bit abandoned by them, I felt it was maybe partially caused by everything surrounding my relationship with Manny and that if that was the case, I apologize, I never meant to drop our friendship, but that I wanted to explain that Manny manipulated me away from all of my friends (especially all male friends). I said I was hoping to sit down with them, cause I missed them in my life and I just wanted to sort it out and see each other more often again.

So we did, we scheduled a dinner together. That night, we ate, we drank wine and eventually we got to the topic at hand. Drake is always a bit more timid, he took to the background, while Josh and I mostly talked. About how the friendship had already been fading a little, they struggled with the fact I was always struggling (which is fair, I have been through a lot of trauma, which has obviously weighed on my mental health and thus doesn’t always make me the happy go lucky kind of friend, even though I very much try to keep my issues from taking up too much space within any friendship), Josh said that every time I have a boyfriend, I disappear for a bit (They never talked to me about feeling any sort of way about it, but it's also not like I've really had any lengthy relationships since being friends with them). Then we somehow got to the topic of Manny. I don’t remember how, but Drake brought up how I just couldn’t let that go and he didn’t understand why. He’d made a comment about him when we saw each other briefly the week before that I had wanted to bring up, but I hadn’t yet.

I told them the reason I can’t let it go, is because he abused me. I am traumatized. This man abused me, his ex-wife, the ex before her, he’s consistently using everyone around him (hasn’t paid rent since I left him in June, even though landlord is supposedly his friend), he lies about everything and I have been having to deal with the fact that I loved, slept with and was pregnant with a man who abused me and sexually abused his own three year old daughter. That’s when all of a sudden they started listening. They asked me to specify. Apparently Drake and Josh have not actually paid attention to anything I have said or any of the essays that I wrote and publicly posted about this. Josh told me he genuinely thought I had just been going for some kind of revenge, because I was mad at Manny after the breakup. I had told them I fucking fled from this man’s house, that I was traumatized, I stayed with my parents for two months after, I could barely leave the house for weeks and was terrified to go into the city, to go out, to potentially run into him and they thought I was just being dramatic. For seven months, they thought I was being dramatic. They never contacted me once during this time. We either ran into each other or I had to initiate contact, which I had mostly stopped doing at this point and often if I did, they didn’t have time for me.

So it wasn’t until I specifically laid out the situations that led to the sexual abuse allegations that they listened. My pain was not taken seriously. The child’s was. As it should be, but why is the trauma I endured irrelevant? I have consistently been pushing myself aside at any turn to make sure this child was protected from Manny and I will keep doing this until I know for sure he can never reach her again. Yes, I prioritize her safety and happiness over mine, even though I was only in her life as a parental figure for 6 months. This child needs to be safe and okay, whatever it costs me. A lot of the friends that were there at the breaking point and wanted to listen, the friends that believed me from the start have never once tried to downplay my trauma, even if they did push me to go to child protective services. They always wanted me to be okay, to be safe, and only if I was, make sure Manny's ex-wife and daughter are also safe. I am hurt and feel betrayed by Drake and Josh’s reactions to my suffering. Drake apologized profusely for not being there for me, but Josh just seemed in shock and then we didn’t fully finish the conversation, because another friend showed up.

I don’t want to lose them, but I also don’t think I can hold onto to the friendship if they just won’t believe me. Until that day Josh did still have a drink with Manny if they ran into each other in a club. Drake would be offended that Manny wouldn’t greet him out on the street. They just never believed me. 

I am genuinely heartbroken by their comments and it feels like it just brought on a whole new wave of intense emotions about a situation that has already been so fucking hard to get through.

Should I reach out to them to talk about this again? Should I just stay away, officially tell them I'm done with the friendship if this is how they treat my trauma or just let it fade? I feel like I'm stuck. I've already lost so much (my feeling of safety, my trust, my confidence, friends, I lost all faith in men) because of Manny and I don't want to let him take more away from me, but maybe these friends are just also not good for me?

I’m using 20g beans to 340g water using a DF64 grinder. I’ve dialed it finer and finer each time to see if that helps. 

After some research, I’ve also increased the temp of the water to around 207f when I start pouring. I only agitate it for the first two pours, and that’s minimally. 

I do a 45 sec bloom, and then do 3 additional pours. 60g initial pour, pour to 140g, then 240, and lastly 340. 

My finish times with the increase in water temp has been around 3:30-3:40. It was much slower with lower temps.

First time posting here and appreciate all replies!

I traveled to Tanzania last year and have been working on videos highlighting and sharing my experience throughout my trip.  
When I went to Kilimanjaro area, I visited the Chagga tribe, Materuni Village - which I understand to be a popular tourist location.  
  
Some of the songs they sang, as they worked on the coffee production process had Swahili, which I was able to translate.  
  
**Request:**  
There are two or three sections I would still love to have translated, only 20 - 40 seconds, for each song. I LOVE the singing and want to do it justice. I was so happy learning what the background, history and culture on some of the songs.  
  
**If you're able to speak Bantu, or Sukuma languages, please let me know in the DM's!**  
I was told some of what they sing is a motivational song used when jogging, for example.  
If you think it may be Swahili, or know another region's dialect, happy to share to see if you can help figure it out!  


I am happy to share the experience here in this reddit, if people are interested in seeing my final video production. I've spent about 50 hours cleaning it up, adding subtitles, etc.  
Happy to share previous posts upon request as well, but not wanting to break self-promotion/solicitation rules :)

1r6jijb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_lootrdotfun/comments/1r6jijb/im_building_a_static_nft_history_project_about/,I’m building a “static NFT + history” project about commodities — would love honest feedback,"Hi everyone I'm presenting myself as LootrdotFun,

I’ve been working on a long-term NFT project called COMMODIA and I’d like honest feedback before launching it publicly. (This project is experimental as I'm not qualify coder and must of the time I'm asking AI to code it for me!) (I do have a felling on how an app or website functionality needs to work so lets hope I don't mess up the idea.)

So before you move in to the reading be sure I'm not responsible for any loses and you are fully responsible to connect your wallet with dapps, websites and so on... with things not fully tested and audited if you fell like contributing let me know.

As of now i don't have the much ETH to deploy the 2 fully created contracts but Commodia is in Sepolia test net and the dapp is working in my local environment, i just need to pay for the server to run the front end demo marketplace...

(I still have to finger out how to deploy it in the hosting said but before spending any money i want to find out if this idea seams to be ok)

    WE will be using: React + Vite + TypeScript dApp for Sepolia marketplace monitoring, with:
    - Subgraph snapshot/activity reads
    - Infura HTTP + WebSocket providers
    - Ethers v6
    - Zustand state
    - 90s terminal/CRT UI

The idea is different from most NFT collections apart that its main approach was to create a trading businesses felling between collectors, enthusiast, and flippers in to a trading floor.

COMMODIA is a fixed set of 10,000 commodity cards (Wheat, Oil, Copper, etc).  
The art and metadata never change. Ever.

[](https://preview.redd.it/im-building-a-static-nft-history-project-about-commodities-v0-ud0mnw6lnvjg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ad46fb6753b4ecd1d033f1d10d0f1d4385bdc2)

There are:

* No trait upgrades
* No evolving visuals
* No staking
* No gamification

https://preview.redd.it/yycx8wtgswjg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6030f725abdf0c6ab184816be0bf47fd3d604280

Instead, what grows over time is the historical context around each card.

If you own a card, you can submit “Time-Stamped Economic Snapshots” — short factual statements about real-world events (for example: “Oil prices collapsed after supply shock”).

The text itself is stored off-chain (Arweave/IPFS), but the proof and confirmations are stored on Ethereum.

UPLOADED: Arweave already spent $ to upload the cards images and also metadata. (permanent uploaded confirmation)

https://preview.redd.it/eqlwp04jswjg1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=dbfc77f76a2ae222aad3f100dfd8efce5f6a50e4

[](https://preview.redd.it/im-building-a-static-nft-history-project-about-commodities-v0-4h29fv8knvjg1.png?width=1864&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4ff97fae9f38751fbd8325abdf8172c11a8b312)

So the card stays fixed.  
The world changes around it.

Some cards may end up with rich historical records. (or non at all)  
Others may stay silent forever.  
That’s intentional.

There’s also a rare “finalization” system that permanently closes historical periods.

It’s meant to feel more like:

* a reference archive
* a collectible document
* a long-term recor

…than a typical PFP project.

I’ve already generated the full artwork, archived it, and built the contract. I’m testing with a small demo set first.

https://reddit.com/link/1r6jijb/video/ni7nnh8kswjg1/player

I’m not selling anything yet. I’m trying to understand:

* Does this concept feel meaningful?
* Would you collect something like this?
* Does it feel too abstract?
* What would make it clearer or better?

If anyone wants to test or review, I can share screenshots and links. (working on the link show interest for me to post...)

Open to all feedback, good or bad.

If you interested in deployment send me a donation to (**0x3cA853F23749FED81A9346b957085E07f8559a5d**) at the end of the day you the one contributing to this project with your ETH to deploy!

(hope it works what i have here, don't donate if you need your ETH be ready! expect it will not go 100% smooth as i said the code of this project is fully created by AI, I'm not a coder just an enthusiast trying things)

1r6jcjr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r6jcjr,"Insert witty, descriptive title","I opened up a Swedish Wet Menu 6 today and she's huge I tell ya. It has 4 mains with the Alfredo and Muesli being dry. As with all of these 24 hour meals there are loads of items to check out with 3 different brands. Blå Band, Orifo, OutMeals and RationTech. I ate breakfast and will probably eat the pasta later since I'm making pinto beans and ham for later. 

I had chocolate granola, chocolate chip cookies, chocolate hazelnut spread, coffee and candies. I also had my leftover chicken McGriddles to round it out. It ended up being quite a bit of food. The candies really pushed it over the edge. All jokes aside these are always fun to dig into and the Swedes eat well, as do the other countries who use Outmeals. Plus the bags are a hoot to read. 

This is going to be a short review because the meal was small and I've already reviewed some of the components before. 

Chicken McGriddles are always a 10/10 and probably the best item McDonald's sells. Just saying. 

The coffee is good, not great but gets the job done and I mixed it with a Sweet and Creamy to add some extra oomph since no sugar or creamer is included. The hazelnut spread is a nice sweet treat to add to other items since the sweetness is toned down to me. I had some on a cookie and the protein bar. I wouldn't want a lot of it though because it's really sweet. The protein bar was cookies and cream and was like a really dry rice crispy treat, so it needed the spread for some moisture along with the coffee. All of these would be like a 6.5/10. A bit better than middling but not the greatest. It gets the job done. 

This was the first time I've had the chocolate chip cookies from RationTech and a solid cookie but I didn't really get chocolate chip from it. It was very crispy and crunchy. I'm a chewier cookie kind of guy myself but it is what it is. Not a lot of chocolate flavor but satisfying enough. Another 6.5/10.

The chocolate muesli called for cold water and after sitting for a few minutes it thickens up quite nicely into an oatmeal like consistency. It kept its crunch for the 10 minutes or so it took to eat but had a bit of a slimy texture. It wasn't off putting or anything but it was there. I'll have to check out the ingredients. It also had this light popcorn flavor that made it pop. Compared to the chocolate muesli in the NAFRs it's not near as good but it's still a winner. 8.5/10 for me.

I'll snack on the rest throughout the week to supplement my meals especially since the wet mains are pretty big. ",3,1771270228.0,MRE,3,1.0,False

Outcome: not nearly as lucrative as the hype. After about three weeks I had maybe $10–20 worth of gift cards/points across everything and one app hit a payout threshold that took forever to reach.

1r6j5pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1r6j5pg/marriage_break_ends_soon_he_cheated_apologized/,"Marriage break ends soon. He cheated, apologized, but has no plan. How do you tell real change from better words?","LONG POST\*\*

I've been staring at this for a while trying to figure out how to explain my situation without sounding unhinged, so I'm just going to lay it out as clearly as I can.

My husband and I (M31, F27) agreed to what he called a ""marriage break"" on December 29th. Two months of limited contact, no sex, no seeing other people basically a pause so I could decide if we're staying married or not. The break ends March 1st, and I'm expected to decide whether we move forward together. We saw each other here and there there was a wedding that I was supposed to go to and just recently we spent Valentines together. I know it’s confusing, but I still love him.

It didn't really feel like a negotiation. He dominated the conversation with lectures and expectations, and I agreed because I was exhausted and emotionally checked out.

THE CHEATING AND THE TIMELINE

He cheated on me in February 2025. I found evidence (including a voice recording), confronted him, and he gaslit me. He didn't fully admit to what happened until September 2025.

After the admission, we stopped having sex for about a month and a half because I didn't feel safe. By December, he knew how detached I was, and that's when the ""break"" conversation happened.

Now I'm being asked to decide the future of my marriage in two months, after months of delayed truth and emotional fallout.

THE PATTERN THAT BROKE ME

This didn't start with cheating.

Even when we were dating, he minimized my depression. I've been told to ""just put a smile on your face"" after arguments. last week I've cried out of frustration not to manipulate, just because I was overwhelmed he chuckled then hugged me then we can continue the conversation, like I'm being dramatic. There's rarely comfort. It feels like my emotions are something to manage or correct, not understand.

We're in couples therapy specifically because of this dynamic. But in February, during therapy, he denied saying something I clearly remember him saying and then later he said he misremembered, but it was because of his tone. I started yelling because I was frustrated, and then he called me after and apologized for his tone demanded the I apologized, but for my tone when I got frustrated.

THE ""BREAKTHROUGH""

Just a couple days ago, he said he finally ""gets it.""

He acknowledged that he makes me feel small when I finally had a conversation with him about how he makes me feel. He said he understands my depression better. I felt relief. But there's no concrete plan. No ""here's what I'll do differently."" No accountability structure. Just acknowledgment. And I can't tell if this is genuine insight or just better-packaged words.

He describes cheating as a ""mistake,"" sometimes as something ""spiritual warfare,"" while also saying he's taking accountability. That doesn't sit right with me.

A mistake is spilling coffee. Cheating is a chain of choices. You don't accidentally cross that line. Saying ""I didn't know what I was doing"" while also claiming accountability feels contradictory. Admitting it happened feels like step zero, not accountability.

What I keep asking for is a clear, consistent explanation of the choices he made, where he could have stopped and didn't, and what he's doing to ensure it never happens again. Instead, the explanation keeps shifting. For basically all he can offer is how he relates to his friends that are woman majority of them are are from back home or moved to different countries, but still.

THE PRESSURE TO MOVE IN AND ""FIX"" MYSELF

A lot of his current complaints about me — how tidy I am, how I handle myself ""as a woman,"" being late sometimes, not taking criticism well — he's said were there before he cheated. At the same time, my depression is often framed as an excuse rather than context.

He believes our biggest issue is ""cultural differences."" He brings up his upbringing and traditional expectations around gender roles and expects me to adapt to that.

There's also growing suspicion around my friendships. He's implied that things could happen when I stay over at friends' places, questioned my judgment, and compared my boundaries with his coworkers even though the only people I asked him to cut off were the person he cheated with and another woman he got too close to afterward. He frames this as me limiting his friendships.

Meanwhile, he says that after cheating, he did everything to make me feel secure and that when he feels insecure, I don't do enough.

I feel like I'm constantly managing his emotions and his ego so I don't get punished emotionally.

MY MOM AND THE EMOTIONAL LOAD

Another layer: my mom's health is declining. She can't brush her teeth properly anymore, wears diapers, and needs increasing care. I'm torn between wanting to build my own life and not being able to emotionally abandon her.

His response has been that my mom has already lived her life and I need to move out and focus on myself. Intellectually, I understand the idea of independence. Emotionally, it feels cold and dismissive of the reality I'm living in.

THE FRIENDSHIP ULTIMATUM

There's another layer to all of this.

I have a close female friend who I've gotten really close to during the break. We get along incredibly well, and honestly, she's been one of the only people who makes me feel seen right now.

My husband is deeply insecure about this friendship. He wants me to cut her off completely by March 1st if we're moving forward with the marriage.

Part of his reasoning is that I've ""disrespected"" him by sleeping over at her house multiple times. He sees this as crossing a boundary, even though nothing about the friendship itself violates the terms of the break.

He's also implied it's because she's gay and we're ""too close,"" which feels like him projecting his own infidelity onto my friendships. The irony is that I only asked him to cut off two people — the woman he cheated with and another woman he got close to afterward. But somehow my close friendship is the problem.

My therapist warned me that cutting her off just to appease his insecurities would breed resentment and probably wouldn't work anyway.

But he's framing it as a dealbreaker. Either I cut her off, or we can't move forward.

THE FINANCIAL TRAP

I also invested a significant amount of money into a business with him without a legal contract. If I leave, I’m pretty sure that I will get majority of my money, but I still do need to write up a contract because it’s not too late but also it’s not in his character even though he’s a shitty person for cheating on me.

I hate that this even factors into my thinking, but it does. Leaving would cost me emotionally and financially.

WHERE I'M STUCK

I feel emotionally detached. I don't feel like we have real conversations or he would say that I don’t have have future conversations with him, but how can I ?just corrections, expectations, and pressure to move forward without fully resolving what broke us. He got us marriage books. I’m trying to read it, but it’s hard to overcome something like this.

I have less than three weeks to decide whether to stay married to someone who admits he makes me feel small, cheated on me, gaslit me afterward, and still hasn't articulated a concrete plan for change.

So my question is this:

How do you tell the difference between someone who is genuinely starting to see their patterns — and someone who's just learned the right words?

Does acknowledgment actually lead to change, or is it sometimes just a better performance?

I'm not asking whether marriage is hard. I know it is.

I'm asking whether love is supposed to feel this unsafe.

1r6izhs,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1r6izhs/the_quality_of_tim_hortons_food_has_declined/,The quality of Tim Hortons food has declined significantly,"Canadian born and raised in Ontario here 👋 I’ve been enjoying Tim’s for my whole life (I’m 24) going to tims a couple times a week since I was a teenager, especially in highschool I’d eat there everyday! Anyways I wanted to start a conversation on what I’ve noticed over the past 6 ish years… the food quality has significantly gone down hill.

 I wanted to write this post on Reddit after getting something simple from Tim’s today. I hadn’t been in a while and wanted something to eat. My order was an ice coffee and a hash brown. Coffee was great! Can’t really go wrong. I expected the same from the hash brown, again thinking how can you go wrong, you toast it up and serve it as fresh as you can. I’ve gotten this order for light breakfast for years and again noticed the quality going down. Anyway, I was slightly surprised the hash brown was room temp cold, tasted old, and had this weird old grease taste. It made me realize why I stopped eating Tim’s food in the past 3 ish years. If something as simple as a hash brown tastes like this, I can’t imagine how the rest of the food has declined. 

You might be thinking, well it’s probably just that specific tims chain you went to, or you probably went late during breakfast peak and the hash brown was older… this order was placed and eaten at 9:30… normal breakfast time for anyone, and I’ve noticed this issue with so many chains across Ontario. 

Tim hortons food used to have be fresh (as fresh as chain food can be), quality, and safe to eat. I’m confident in saying it no longer is. 

Another example: the ✨farmers wrap✨

I started eating this in highschool 2015-2019. During this time Tim’s was still using the cardboard peel boxes for the wraps. During this time the wraps were fresh, actually hot,(I remember actually having to wait a minute or two for the food to cool down) flavourful, prepped neatly and purposefully and tasted fresh. I absolutely loved this food item from Tim’s I practically ate it everyday for lunch. Once I left highschool the duration of when I would get this food item dropped from daily to maybe once or twice a week until I fully stopped eating it 2 years ago. I stopped eating it because of the similar issues I listed with the hash brown. The packaging change sucks but it wasn’t really a deal breaker, the wraps got significantly smaller, the prep of the wrap has become so sloppy it seems like the workers just throw everything in it, slab either a heaping amount of sauce or none at all, never hot or warm!!!! Seriously never…Never fresh tasting, and tastes like stale food, never toasted nicely. It’s a complete change in how this item used to be, which I feel like should be concerning and alarming. What’s changed? Again this is something I’ve found with multiple tims locations across Ontario, even all the way up north. 

First world problems, I know… but it’s just so confusing and mind boggling to me that in this period of time the food has declined that much. I could go on and on about different food items and how the ‘cooked’ eggs gave my friend food poisoning a couple months ago but I’m gonna stop here. 

I’m asking if anyone else has noticed this? And if not what province are you in where the tims quality is just as good as it was 6 years ago? Wish I could enjoy this chain again but the only thing I ever order now is an ice coffee. I absolutely do not trust the food to be good quality, flavourful, or safe anymore and today was my last time ever giving the food a try again. ",16,1771269440.0,TimHortons,51,0.74,False

*Apartment 13*, Vic thought, knocking softly. *Let’s see what this character has to say.* The door swung open, revealing Orson in a Miley Cyrus shirt. 

 

“Hey there, buddy,” Orson yelped, engulfing Vic in an onion-stench bear hug. “I’ve so much to show you.”

 

Following him into the apartment, Vic said, “Yeah, yeah, let’s make it quick, pal. I’ve got a dentist appointment later, and I don’t wanna miss it. I’ve already damn near chewed my own lips off. You know, I—” 

 

Vic had expected Orson’s apartment to be a stereotypical lurker lair, wallpapered with newspaper cutouts, marked city maps, and stalker-shot photographs. *Or at least filled with baby bottles, like in that awesome Peter Straub story. What was the name of it? Oh yeah, “The Buffalo Hunter.”* He certainly hadn’t expected:   

 

Were one to step into the center of Orson’s living room and then spin themselves into a slow rotation, they’d have witnessed an apartment divided into twelve segments, each decorated with a holiday theme. 

 

Every bit of wall space bore ornamentation. January’s sliver was filled with domino masks, confetti and noisemakers—New Year’s, obviously. While one might have expected the February sliver to focus on Valentine’s Day, tiered display shelves occupied that bit of wall space, each exhibiting an assortment of stuffed groundhogs. *Did Orson do the taxidermy work himself?* Vic wondered.     

 

For March, Orson had selected Saint Patrick’s Day, with shamrocks, leprechauns, and Guinness Draught posters aplenty. April was another taxidermy exhibition—rabbits, this time—alongside a multicolored plastic egg collection. May was a collage of photographs, each featuring a broad-faced, homely woman. June too was all photographs, this time presenting a sickly, liver-spotted man. *Mother’s Day and Father’s Day*, Vic guessed. The floor felt as if it were rearing up under him—a spooked stallion attempting to buck Vic into Earth’s exosphere. 

 

July was all fireworks, stars and stripes. August was dedicated to V-J Day, with that iconic nurse-kissing sailor print juxtaposed with newspapers trumpeting Japan’s surrender, and posters of mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

 

September’s sliver was highly offensive. For some reason, Orson had chosen to highlight 9/11: Twin Towers burning, United Airlines banners, turbans, and a faux-autographed Osama bin Laden portrait. Just looking at it made Vic nauseous. 

 

Fortunately, October, November, and December were as expected: jack-o’-lanterns, turkeys, ornaments, ghouls, pilgrims, reindeers, gifts, candy wrappers, a white-bearded fat man, and an overflowing cornucopia. Still… 

 

In the face of such madness, Vic’s first thought was to spout incongruity: “Do crocodile clowns cry phosphorescent tears?” a query that Orson would have likely attached strange significance to. Instead, Vic lamely blurted, “Uh…happy holidays.”

 

*“Happy holidays?”* he thought. *This guy’s gonna skin you alive, man. Why the fuck did I come here? In the realm of the Silent, it doesn’t matter if my screams are heard. They’d rather ignore ’em than attempt any rescues. Run for the hills, Vic, or maybe Hill Street, where that terrible rap song promised that twerk-proficient sluts dwell. Makin’ it clap, wubba wubba.*     

 

“Have you checked the news yet?” Orson asked, flushed with repressed exhilaration. 

 

“You know, it completely escaped my mind. Pretty much all I’ve done today is swallow my own blood. Here, take a look at this.” He peeled his lips back, revealing their well-gnawed inner linings. 

 

“Yowza. You know, I got some vinegar you can chug. Perhaps with a couple squirts of fresh lemon juice.”

 

“Asshole.” *Okay, we’re joking around now. Maybe this future mall Santa isn’t gonna make a thong bikini out of me just yet. In fact, I’m just gonna ask it.* “Dude, what the hell is going on with your interior decorating? Are you some kind of recovering Jehovah’s Witness or something?”

 

“What, you disapprove?”

 

“I don’t even know where to start, man.” 

 

“It’s actually quite simple, friend. Holidays bring people together, yeah? All over the world, the holiday spirit infects folks with celebratory mood shades. But is it the date itself that does it? Do you feel nothing on December 23rd? No, man, it’s the whole damn season—the preceding weeks, plus the two-day aftermath. It’s the decorations, the imagery, the clothes, and the jingles. But guess what, Buttercup. You can feel it every day. Hell, you can feel several holidays at once.”

 

“Yeah…that sounds pretty stupid.” 

 

“Oh, I’ll make a convert out of you yet. Hey, what did ya say your name was?”

 

“Vic. Vic Dickens.”

 

“Victor…sounds about right. So, are you ready to peel the Silent Minority’s skin back, to see the gremlins operating behind the scenes?”

 

“Just as long as ‘gremlins’ isn’t code for ‘kidnapped children,’ I don’t see the harm in it.”

 

“Children? Can’t stand the little bastards.”

 

“Me neither. Let’s ship ’em all to an island, along with their moronic parents.”

 

“Yeah, except maybe the boats mysteriously sink halfway. No survivors.”

 

“I like the way you think, bro.”

 

“We’re like mental mirrors reflecting each other’s thoughts at this point.”

 

“Yeah, well…anyway, maybe you can drop a little knowledge on me. I do have that appointment to get to.”  

 

“Sure, sure. Places to go, people to be. I know the drill. Hey, remember Matilda Grieves, that trigger-happy babe on the bus?”

 

“That broad would be tough to forget. I mean, come on, she shot that kid yesterday, and pointed her Ruger right at me.”

 

“Sure did. Remember what she was shouting? ‘Why do you watch me?’ and all that.”

 

“Yeah…”

 

“Guess what, friend. They *are* watchin’ us.”

 

Judging by Orson’s expression, it seemed that he expected Vic to gasp. Instead, Vic replied, “No shit, dumbass. That’s how I got recruited into this turkey shoot to begin with.”

 

“Okay, okay. But did you know that they’re *always* watchin’ us? In the bathroom, as we sleep, everywhere at all times.”    

 

“Yeah, I figured as much. They’re following my neighbors, too. I don’t know how far up this thing goes, but it’s definitely bigger than a pack of disgruntled introverts. I mean, the cost and the resources involved. It’s like the NSA or something. There’s a bigger picture here, but what is it?”

 

“That’s the question, Victor. Here, check this out.”

 

Dragging an armchair to where two walls met the ceiling, Orson used his apartment key to pry an object out of a tiny crevice therein. Stepping closer, Vic saw a lens within a black plastic tube. Four wires trailed out from it—red, white, yellow and black—attached to something within the walls. 

 

“Is that what I think it is?”

 

“Sure is. You’re looking at a high definition micro spy camera, broadcasting wirelessly to our overseers. Two days ago, I swept this place with a radio frequency detector. These things are all over my apartment—I’ve counted seven thus far. I’m sure that your apartment is filled with ’em, too.”

 

“Damn…” Vic muttered, wondering how many hours of joyless masturbation they’d filmed of him. “I don’t even know what to say.” 

 

“That’s not all, partner. See this little serial number on the side here? This is the latest Investutech model. These things don’t even hit the market until next year. 4K resolution, man, with infrared lenses that slide on in the darkness. Seriously, I’d like to get a few of these installed in that ladies gym down the street…you know, the one where all the hot girls go, where creeps like us are turned away at the door. Man, I could beat myself dry.”

 

“Yeah, whoever’s in charge of this weirdness is obviously connected.”

 

“Obvs.”

 

“Hey, wait a minute. Can we track the transmission to the receiver?”

 

“Way ahead of you, man. When the Silent Minority recruited you, did they do it by obtaining your IP address, and then hacking your ISP’s records to find your home address?”

 

“Yeah, their message said something like that.”

 

“So…if they could do it, why can’t we? This camera transmits over Wi-Fi, so all that we need to do is track the data stream. You ever heard of a wireless sniffer?”

 

“No.”

 

“Here, check this out.” Orson snatched a laptop off his kitchen counter. As it booted up, he pulled the spy camera out of the wall. Then, with the aid of a USB adaptor, he plugged the device into his laptop. He fingered his keyboard, and the screen filled with words and numbers, a cipher that Vic found incomprehensible. 

 

“Okay, what you’re seeing here is a program that logs network traffic,” Orson explained. “As the camera streams data, this packet analyzer is able to track it, all the way back to the receiver.” He tapped the screen. “You see that? That’s their IP address. Now, if we could hack into their Internet service provider’s records, we could get the receiver’s exact address.”

 

“You can’t do it?”

 

“I’m good, but not that good. Fortunately, there’s another way.”

 

He opened a new program. “Check this out. I found this geolocation software online. I don’t even know if it’s legal. Watch.” When he entered the receiver’s IP address, crude animation sprang into existence. A world map became a continent map, then a state map, then a city map. Finally, a single property was spotlit. “That’s the one: 1456 Lake Street.”

 

“Who lives there? Can you find that out?”

 

“Actually, the place is classified as a commercial property. The property records say that it’s owned by Elger & Associates. Since I could unearth no information about that company, it’s obviously a shell. 

 

“I’m trying to follow the money trail, but I just keep uncovering more shell companies—layers and layers stretching into infinity—shareholders and boards of directors, all ghosts. Look at this: Puerto Rico, Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam, and on and on and on.”

 

“Well, let me know if you find anything.”

 

“Sure will, buddy.”   

 

A thought hit Vic: *Holy shit, I used a Wi-Fi home security camera when I killed Knut. If it’s that easy to intercept data streams, then the Silent Minority might have that footage. Man, talk about blackmail potential. I’m under the thumbs of probable Peeping Tom perverts, and I have no idea what their deal is. What the fuck am I supposed to do?*  

 

“Well, I better get goin’, Orson. My appointment is in twenty minutes and I can’t afford to miss it. If I spend another day wearing this cannibal grin, I’ll end up lipless. Thanks for your hospitality, or whatever.”

 

“No problem, pal. And hey…be careful. They know that we’re on to them now. If they could make Matilda disappear, they could just as easily ghost us.”

 

“Shit…you’re right.”

 

“As rain, and twice as plain.”

 

“Whatever.”



 

**Chapter 11**

 

Two weeks later, Vic’s fixed teeth still looked off: too damn white, glowing as if radioactive. *Man, I’m gonna need cigarettes and coffee*, he thought. *Lots and lots…enough to put some yellow on these here smilin’ ivories.* 

 

He sink-spat Scope, and then visited the living room for some channel surfing. *Well, well, well…XBC News. And what are they yammering about this morning? Nanny Gaines again, big surprise.*

 

As with the Squids takedown, the media had spun the events into a terrorism scare. Profiling each of the dead Silent, they’d elicited condemnation from ex-neighbors, former schoolmates, and even a few relatives. “I always thought there was something off about ’em,” was repeated ad nauseam, along with every variation thereof. “Too intense…too quiet.”   

 

No mention was made of the Silent Minority, or retribution for persecuted introverts. Instead: “Al-Qaeda in the United States,” “Terror in Suburbia,” “Our Children, Our Enemies,” and other headlines equally incendiary. Supposedly, the dead Silent were Muslim extremists, recruited through message boards and clandestine MMORPG communications. They’d assaulted Nanny and the Squids—*hey, not a bad band name*—because those individuals represented traditional American values. *Give me a fuckin’ break.* 

 

Never one to let a dead horse go unmolested, Nanny Gaines and her family rode their “heroics” right up the media mountain. With every passing day, *Nanny Says*’ Nielsen ratings shot further into the stratosphere, overtaking even that most sacred to the slack-jawed, the hallowed Super Bowl. XBC began rerunning her *Celebrity Dance Off* season, with speculation that Nanny would return for *Celebrity Dance Off Superstar* in a few months. 

 

Worse, the incident had made celebrities of Nanny’s two children. Prior to the Silent’s calamitous field trip, Vic had known nothing about Thad and Mimi. Now, every time that he checked the news, he found himself bombarded with news of their celebrity sweethearts, their simplistic philosophies concerning religion—“Christianity, or you’re tongue kissin’ Satan”—and every appearance they made anywhere. Similarly, he came to know and loathe Beaumont “Bucktooth” Gaines—former pastor, current realtor, and all-around dickweed.

 

Now the morning news reported that the foursome and their zany, gun-toting household staff were filming a reality show. Supposedly, *The Nanny Clan* would show the public what the Gaines’ were up to when they weren’t “fightin’ for American freedom.” 

 

*Nanny Clan?* Vic thought. *Shouldn’t they spell that with a K? And why are they only mentioning the dead Silent? What happened to the fourteen in the gimp suits? Doesn’t anybody miss them? God, I could have been one of ’em, chained up in a stable somewhere, my ass striped with flagellation marks. Maybe I should start carrying around a cyanide pill.*

 

Vic sighed. The time had come. He’d put off calling his parents for too long. *They’ve got to be back in Florida by now. What’s that number again? Oh yeah.* 

 

Three rings, and then Vic’s father answered, “Hello.” The man was panting heavily and, for a moment, Vic wondered if the skinpopper-delivered beatdown had left him debilitated.

 

“You feelin’ okay, Dad?” Vic asked. *Please let him be.*

 

“Victor, is that you? Jeez, how long has it been, boy? We thought we’d see you during our visit, but I guess you were out of town.”

 

“Yeah, something like that.” *Christ, how do I steer our discussion toward their Turquoise Street incident? If I say anything about the Silent Minority’s surveillance, they’ll call the cops, and this entire house of cards will come crashing down around me.* Instead, he repeated his question: “You feelin’ okay, Dad?”

 

“Sure, why wouldn’t I be? Oh, the panting. No worries there. We just bought ourselves a home gym, and I was doing the ol’ military press when you called. I’m really workin’ up a sweat here.” 

 

“Home gym? Aren’t you a little old for bodybuilding? Why the sudden fitness regimen?” *Admit it, Dad*, he wished to demand. *No need for pretense.*

 

“Well…you know, Vic, when a man reaches my advanced age, the tendency is to go plus-sized. You know the drill: sitting on the couch all day, drinking beer and eating junk food until one’s chest could fill a woman’s bra. I’ve been guilty of that myself, I’m sorry to admit. Recently, though, I’ve had a breakthrough. From now on, I’m dedicating two hours of every day to working out. Next time we see each other, you might just mistake me for a muscleman.”

 

*Ah, gotcha!* Vic thought triumphantly, even as he asked, “Breakthrough, huh? And what prompted this development?” *Say it. Say it.*                  

 

“A Stallone marathon, actually. If that dude can rip throats out in his sixth decade, I can at least attempt to see my member when I urinate.”

 

“Gross. You know, some things are better unvoiced. And that’s all it was then, Sylvester Stallone?”

 

“Sure, call it divine Rambolical inspiration. Watch four of those back-to-back, and you’re ready to punch the face off the first scumbag who accosts you. You should try it sometime. Oh, incidentally, your mother and I are selling the house. You have until the end of the month to move everything out, and then we’re turning the property over to a realtor.”

 

“Wait…what?”

 

“Don’t worry, my boy. We’ll set you up somewhere new. It’s just, when we were on Turquoise Street, we couldn’t help noticing how seedy it’s become. That’s not the right sort of environment for a guy like you, and it certainly isn’t the friendly block party-throwin’ neighborhood that we originally moved into. In fact, why don’t you start looking into condos? We’ll transfer you enough money for the down payment, and pay the whole thing off when the house sells.”  

 

*Should I tell him not to bother? Am I gonna be in this Silent complex forever?* “Yeah, I’ll do that, Dad. In the meantime, maybe we can put our furniture in storage.”

 

“Sure, or you can have a garage sale.”

 

“In *that* neighborhood? Those bastards will probably pay me in gang rapes.”

 

“Language, Son. Come to think of it, though, I wouldn’t put it past ’em.”

 

“Yeah, things are tough all over.”  

 

After twenty-seven more minutes of small talk, their conversation finally concluded. Hanging up, Vic released a sigh, wondering, *Okay, what the hell am I gonna do now?*



 

**Chapter 12**

 

Three months later, the Turquoise Street property had been sold. Its displaced furniture was in storage, and Vic’s bank account was overflowing. Biweekly, his parents called, asking how the condo hunt was going. “Great, great,” Vic always told them, “but I think I’m gonna keep looking.” As far as they knew, Vic was currently renting a room, one of seven individuals occupying a two-story Colonial style residence. “One of those awkward Craigslist arrangements,” he’d told them. “No, trust me, you don’t wanna visit. My roommates are frickin’ weird. Wait until I get a real place, and then we’ll throw me a little housewarming party.” 

 

Since the Nanny Gaines incident, there’d been no other Silent Minority excursions. *They’re probably recruiting new introverts,* he thought. *Replenishing our ranks.* He’d settled into a rhythm: eating delicious Beth-cooked meals, reading books and comics, and watching Blu-rays. There’d been no more recordings of his ex-neighbors. It seemed that he could finally put Turquoise Street behind him. *The Silent Minority will have to find some other way to motivate me*, he thought. 

 

Still, he was jittery. He’d been drinking too much coffee, trying to beat back slumber, reducing his shuteye interludes to exhausted twenty-minute catnaps. His reason? Behind Vic’s eyelids, the Guerros and Janssons lurked: mush-faced monstrosities screaming condemnations. Through frigid dreamscapes they pursued him. Zombielike, they lurched along his shadow trails, in a triple-month chase passing through abandoned junkyards, condemned tenements, underwater cities, corpse-filled theme parks, spectral rooms of shifting angles, and dozens of mundane backgrounds borrowed from Vic’s childhood. 

 

Unfortunately, the caffeine bombardment wasn’t much better. Phantom voices arose, vicious auditory hallucinations, a highlight reel composed of past tauntings and overheard plots. But were they really hallucinations? Had the Silent Minority impregnated Vic’s walls with tiny speakers, to pump his ear canals full of verbalized bile, so as to irrevocably warp him into their maladjusted sock puppet? 

 

The voices always seemed to emanate from the next room over. In fact, after many twilight hours spent searching out speakers, Vic’s walls now resembled Swiss cheese. He’d found four spy cameras already. Did they have speakers built in? *Must remember to ask Orson*, he reminded himself for the fourth time that morning.

 

A pressure was building within him, a powerful horniness like nothing he’d ever felt before. He feared that if he masturbated, the culmination would prove explosive enough to send Vic shooting out through his own penis, and thus leave him inside out. He’d been thinking of Beth.    

 

*I need some fresh air*, he thought. *I’m getting too repressed in here, thinking all these madman thoughts. I know, I’ll go for a drive. Where? Anywhere but here.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Don’t do it, Vic. Don’t you dare turn on that radio.* Ignoring the mental voice, Vic conjured up some road music:

 

*When I tap that dime girl’s ass*

*Ooga Booga*

*When I give your momma crabs*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bout to get up on that stab*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bitch, Ooga Booga*

*Bitch*

 

Vic laughed and switched to silence. *Aw, now they’ve gone and done it*, he thought. *They repackaged “Shamdiggly” on us. What’s next? Thugarelli? Watermellow? I just don’t get it.*  

 

At an intersection, awaiting the traffic light’s greening, he noticed a pretty face framed within his rear-view mirror. It belonged to the driver behind him. Idling in a blue Volkswagen Tiguan, she wore black lipstick, aviator sunglasses, and a lace sleeve top—no bra, it appeared. Her cheekbones were high, her breasts attractively ample. Smirking mischievously, she sang along to unheard music. Blunt brunette bangs fell just short of her eyelids. *God, look at her*, Vic thought. *I bet she’s the sexy bassist of an indie rock band, or maybe some kind of slam poet. I’d like to give her a good slamming, that’s for sure.* 

 

In the mirror, he observed her. Involuntarily, he began whispering: “Yeah, that’s right, baby. Sing for Daddy. Has Daddy’s little girl been naughty? Yeah, I bet you have. I bet you like it hard, don’t ya? I’m gonna give it to ya. Oh…yeah.” *Holy shit, did I just say that?* he wondered, alarmed. *I sound like a serial killer. And what’s with this ‘Daddy’ shit? Where the hell did that come from? Man, I hope that those Silent scumfucks don’t have my car bugged, too.*   

 

When the light turned green, Vic sped far ahead of the girl, ashamed and terrified of himself. Graffiti-coated store facades slid past him, as did a pack of geriatric rollerbladers led by four grown men riding Razor scooters. Unfortunately, Vic encountered a sexy sign spinner girl three intersections up—another long, pants-tightening red light. In a tank top and a tiny pair of jean shorts, she jiggled and pranced across the curb corner, twirling a sign advertising Chavo’s Chalupas.     

 

*Lord, help me*, Vic thought. *Petite, with a nice little bubble butt. Damn, look at that thing shake. Now she’s turning. Whoa, she’s waving at me.* Awkwardly, he waved back, but she’d already rotated toward oncoming traffic. *I wonder if she’s legal. She looks college-age, but…man. I don’t know what they’re feeding ’em these days, but it’s getting harder and harder to tell. I mean, look at those glorious tits. Speaking of ‘harder and harder,’ I better start thinking about baseball before I need a freakin’ pants change. Uh…Pete Rose…Padres…hmmm, turns out that I know nothing about baseball.* 

 

Behind him, a car horn honked. *Oh, the light is green. When did that happen?* After one last lingering glance at the sign spinner, Vic sped off. *Wait a minute. Where the hell am I going?*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Eventually, Vic parked outside a supermarket. While Beth’s cooking and the Silent Minority’s fridge-restocking elves had kept him well fed, it had been ages since he’d munched his favorite snack food or chugged his favorite beer. This time, he was going to binge. 

 

The lot was half-full, and Vic took a moment to eye-sweep its perimeter, ensuring that no Turquoise Street Irregulars were waiting to ambush him—or worse, Nanny Gaines and her gimp slaves. The coast was clear, although one disheveled vagrant shot Vic dirty looks from his tree-shaded sitting space. 

 

Pushing a squeaky-wheeled shopping cart, Vic stepped inside. From aisle to aisle he traveled, filling the cart with Cheetos and corn dogs, Skittles and Froot Loops. In the beer aisle, he went a little crazy, grabbing six-packs and twelvers, even a Newcastle mini-keg. 

 

A strange certainty fell over him: *The other shoppers are talking about me.* In the corner of his eye, he saw fingers pointing. Faintly, he heard his name whispered, attached to noun adjuncts such as “faggot,” “weirdo,” “freak” and “sicko.” Turning to identify his defamers, he saw guiltless faces staring back: children, adults and shelf stockers, none of whom seemed to recognize him. *Am I schizophrenic?* he wondered. *Am I so used to persecution that it’s become my mental soundtrack? Should I confront one of these bastards, see if they’re saying what I think they are?*       

 

He hurried to the register, and soon left the store one hundred and thirty-four dollars poorer. As he loaded up his Taurus’ trunk, Vic glanced toward the tree-shaded vagrant. The dude had sprouted a friend, a rutabaga-nosed surfer type, who sat astride a mint green beach cruiser bicycle. Both were looking in Vic’s direction, pointing and grunting. 

 

“Get out of San Diego!” the bicyclist angrily shouted. 

 

*We’re in San Diego County, not San Diego!* Vic might have shouted back. Instead, he finished loading his car. Grinning dangerously at the bum and his friend, he pushed his shopping cart to the cart corral, taking his time with it.    

 

“What are you lookin’ at, bitch?” the vagrant shouted. “Your kind don’t belong here!”

 

*My kind?* Vic wondered. *What’s he mean by that?* Still, he kept silent, keying his engine to life, pulling Killer Mike’s *R.A.P. Music* from his CD case. Skipping ahead to “Don’t Die,” he let the song build in intensity, thinking to himself, *Damn, this shit knocks. How come I never hear stuff like this on the radio?* 

 

Blasting the song at a near-deafening level, he rolled down his driver’s side window and grabbed a handful of change from the coin holder. Pulling up alongside the homeless man, he shouted, “Here, buy yourself a personality!” and chucked the coins as forcefully as he could manage. Most of the quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies sailed between the vagrant’s defensively raised palms, striking his face. Screaming, the man hopped to his feet. 

 

As Vic accelerated away, the pelted man and the bicyclist gave pursuit, shouting threats and hate speech. Laughing, Vic drove home. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two weeks later, he encountered a hassle. Anxious to escape the claustrophobic confines of the Silent Minority complex, he’d set off on yet another aimless drive. He’d cruised the coast for a while, watching surfers carve waves, perving on luscious thong-adorned women. Eventually, he’d grown famished, and found himself visiting a nearby eatery, Aggo’s Diner. The place had outdoor seating, allowing Vic to observe the ongoing flesh parade. *Whoa, look at those sexpots,* he thought, ogling a particularly buxom cluster. *Titties for days. And what’s with those scowling dudes escorting them? Are they men or shaved gorillas?*

 

Lost in solar warmth and sea scent, Vic didn’t feel half bad. In fact, he felt invisible, just another piece of beachfront scenery. When a young Hispanic waitress—neither fat nor thin, but jolly to the utmost—drifted over to take his order, Vic requested a Corona and a burger, plus curly fries. “And for the love of God, bring limes.”  

 

Minutes later, he found himself contemplating a thick Angus beef patty slathered in barbecue sauce, with fried onions atop and smoked bacon below. Between them, three slices of cheese: Swiss, American and cheddar. Gripping its sponge dough bun firmly to keep the miracle together, Vic took a bite. *Sweet Evil Grimace, that’s good!* he thought. He took a sip of beer. *Ah…refreshing. Fries in ketchup…chew and swallow.* *Oh, exalted burger, I didn’t forget about you. Damn, I say…so greasy, so succulent. It coats my heart like a sweater, prelude to a heart attack. Maybe I’ll keel over and die, and some passersby will finish off this beast. Food for thought, heh-heh.*       

 

After two more beers, Vic pushed an empty, sauce-streaked plate forward. *Maybe I’ll head to the shore and take a sand nap*, he thought, sleepy with satiation. “Check, please!” he shouted to the passing waitress.

 

When the background music changed, Vic should have taken it for an ill omen: his day was about to get fucked. An old Sublime song whose name he’d forgotten ended, segueing to something with a faster tempo. *What the hell is this shit?*Vic wondered. *Fiddles and flutes…is that a Moog? What do they even call this type of music? Folk-electropop?* The singer had a country twang; the back-up singers seemed kidnapped from an urban gospel choir. The lyrics, if they even can be described as such, went:  

 

*My name is not Jack* 

*But I can still jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*She may not be a dime*

*More like a stack of pennies*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*Not too fat and*

*Not too skinny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

Vic stuck his fingers in his ears, but the song still got through. He glanced up to see the waitress standing tableside, clutching a black imitation leather check holder. Vic stuck his debit card inside of it, and watched the gal wiggle off to swipe some plastic. She returned just as “Jack-a-ninny” ended.  

 

Her aspect had shifted. Now she looked upon Vic as if he were a large arachnid, or something equally objectionable. “Sir,” she intoned, “I’m afraid that your card’s been declined.” 

 

“Huh. Really? That’s…wait, are you saying my pockets are shallow?”

 

“Like a wading pool. Got any cash, guy? Otherwise, you’ll have to play busboy for a couple of hours. The last dude that came up light, Mr. Aggo made him scrub toilets. And that was on taco night.”

 

Luckily, Vic had a bit of cash handy. Paying the waitress, he deducted a couple of dollars from what he’d planned to tip her, and got the hell out of there. 

 

*Not the radio, you bastard*, he thought to himself. Unable to resist, he heard a DJ introduce Zip-Loke’s latest track, “Dem Showah Boyz.” *No way can this be what I think it is*, Vic thought. But those expecting the worst are rarely disappointed, and thus the lyrics went:

 

*Crackas lookin’ at a nigga like what*

*Crackas ’bout ta get funked in the butt* 

*Den dat soap gets ta droppin’*

*And Zip-Loke gets ta poppin’*

*And dem crackas walkin’ like they got stuck*

 

*Wow,* Vic marveled. *Just…wow.* Then he remembered the debit card, and his countenance clouded over.

*Apartment 13*, Vic thought, knocking softly. *Let’s see what this character has to say.* The door swung open, revealing Orson in a Miley Cyrus shirt. 

 

“Hey there, buddy,” Orson yelped, engulfing Vic in an onion-stench bear hug. “I’ve so much to show you.”

 

Following him into the apartment, Vic said, “Yeah, yeah, let’s make it quick, pal. I’ve got a dentist appointment later, and I don’t wanna miss it. I’ve already damn near chewed my own lips off. You know, I—” 

 

Vic had expected Orson’s apartment to be a stereotypical lurker lair, wallpapered with newspaper cutouts, marked city maps, and stalker-shot photographs. *Or at least filled with baby bottles, like in that awesome Peter Straub story. What was the name of it? Oh yeah, “The Buffalo Hunter.”* He certainly hadn’t expected:   

 

Were one to step into the center of Orson’s living room and then spin themselves into a slow rotation, they’d have witnessed an apartment divided into twelve segments, each decorated with a holiday theme. 

 

Every bit of wall space bore ornamentation. January’s sliver was filled with domino masks, confetti and noisemakers—New Year’s, obviously. While one might have expected the February sliver to focus on Valentine’s Day, tiered display shelves occupied that bit of wall space, each exhibiting an assortment of stuffed groundhogs. *Did Orson do the taxidermy work himself?* Vic wondered.     

 

For March, Orson had selected Saint Patrick’s Day, with shamrocks, leprechauns, and Guinness Draught posters aplenty. April was another taxidermy exhibition—rabbits, this time—alongside a multicolored plastic egg collection. May was a collage of photographs, each featuring a broad-faced, homely woman. June too was all photographs, this time presenting a sickly, liver-spotted man. *Mother’s Day and Father’s Day*, Vic guessed. The floor felt as if it were rearing up under him—a spooked stallion attempting to buck Vic into Earth’s exosphere. 

 

July was all fireworks, stars and stripes. August was dedicated to V-J Day, with that iconic nurse-kissing sailor print juxtaposed with newspapers trumpeting Japan’s surrender, and posters of mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

 

September’s sliver was highly offensive. For some reason, Orson had chosen to highlight 9/11: Twin Towers burning, United Airlines banners, turbans, and a faux-autographed Osama bin Laden portrait. Just looking at it made Vic nauseous. 

 

Fortunately, October, November, and December were as expected: jack-o’-lanterns, turkeys, ornaments, ghouls, pilgrims, reindeers, gifts, candy wrappers, a white-bearded fat man, and an overflowing cornucopia. Still… 

 

In the face of such madness, Vic’s first thought was to spout incongruity: “Do crocodile clowns cry phosphorescent tears?” a query that Orson would have likely attached strange significance to. Instead, Vic lamely blurted, “Uh…happy holidays.”

 

*“Happy holidays?”* he thought. *This guy’s gonna skin you alive, man. Why the fuck did I come here? In the realm of the Silent, it doesn’t matter if my screams are heard. They’d rather ignore ’em than attempt any rescues. Run for the hills, Vic, or maybe Hill Street, where that terrible rap song promised that twerk-proficient sluts dwell. Makin’ it clap, wubba wubba.*     

 

“Have you checked the news yet?” Orson asked, flushed with repressed exhilaration. 

 

“You know, it completely escaped my mind. Pretty much all I’ve done today is swallow my own blood. Here, take a look at this.” He peeled his lips back, revealing their well-gnawed inner linings. 

 

“Yowza. You know, I got some vinegar you can chug. Perhaps with a couple squirts of fresh lemon juice.”

 

“Asshole.” *Okay, we’re joking around now. Maybe this future mall Santa isn’t gonna make a thong bikini out of me just yet. In fact, I’m just gonna ask it.* “Dude, what the hell is going on with your interior decorating? Are you some kind of recovering Jehovah’s Witness or something?”

 

“What, you disapprove?”

 

“I don’t even know where to start, man.” 

 

“It’s actually quite simple, friend. Holidays bring people together, yeah? All over the world, the holiday spirit infects folks with celebratory mood shades. But is it the date itself that does it? Do you feel nothing on December 23rd? No, man, it’s the whole damn season—the preceding weeks, plus the two-day aftermath. It’s the decorations, the imagery, the clothes, and the jingles. But guess what, Buttercup. You can feel it every day. Hell, you can feel several holidays at once.”

 

“Yeah…that sounds pretty stupid.” 

 

“Oh, I’ll make a convert out of you yet. Hey, what did ya say your name was?”

 

“Vic. Vic Dickens.”

 

“Victor…sounds about right. So, are you ready to peel the Silent Minority’s skin back, to see the gremlins operating behind the scenes?”

 

“Just as long as ‘gremlins’ isn’t code for ‘kidnapped children,’ I don’t see the harm in it.”

 

“Children? Can’t stand the little bastards.”

 

“Me neither. Let’s ship ’em all to an island, along with their moronic parents.”

 

“Yeah, except maybe the boats mysteriously sink halfway. No survivors.”

 

“I like the way you think, bro.”

 

“We’re like mental mirrors reflecting each other’s thoughts at this point.”

 

“Yeah, well…anyway, maybe you can drop a little knowledge on me. I do have that appointment to get to.”  

 

“Sure, sure. Places to go, people to be. I know the drill. Hey, remember Matilda Grieves, that trigger-happy babe on the bus?”

 

“That broad would be tough to forget. I mean, come on, she shot that kid yesterday, and pointed her Ruger right at me.”

 

“Sure did. Remember what she was shouting? ‘Why do you watch me?’ and all that.”

 

“Yeah…”

 

“Guess what, friend. They *are* watchin’ us.”

 

Judging by Orson’s expression, it seemed that he expected Vic to gasp. Instead, Vic replied, “No shit, dumbass. That’s how I got recruited into this turkey shoot to begin with.”

 

“Okay, okay. But did you know that they’re *always* watchin’ us? In the bathroom, as we sleep, everywhere at all times.”    

 

“Yeah, I figured as much. They’re following my neighbors, too. I don’t know how far up this thing goes, but it’s definitely bigger than a pack of disgruntled introverts. I mean, the cost and the resources involved. It’s like the NSA or something. There’s a bigger picture here, but what is it?”

 

“That’s the question, Victor. Here, check this out.”

 

Dragging an armchair to where two walls met the ceiling, Orson used his apartment key to pry an object out of a tiny crevice therein. Stepping closer, Vic saw a lens within a black plastic tube. Four wires trailed out from it—red, white, yellow and black—attached to something within the walls. 

 

“Is that what I think it is?”

 

“Sure is. You’re looking at a high definition micro spy camera, broadcasting wirelessly to our overseers. Two days ago, I swept this place with a radio frequency detector. These things are all over my apartment—I’ve counted seven thus far. I’m sure that your apartment is filled with ’em, too.”

 

“Damn…” Vic muttered, wondering how many hours of joyless masturbation they’d filmed of him. “I don’t even know what to say.” 

 

“That’s not all, partner. See this little serial number on the side here? This is the latest Investutech model. These things don’t even hit the market until next year. 4K resolution, man, with infrared lenses that slide on in the darkness. Seriously, I’d like to get a few of these installed in that ladies gym down the street…you know, the one where all the hot girls go, where creeps like us are turned away at the door. Man, I could beat myself dry.”

 

“Yeah, whoever’s in charge of this weirdness is obviously connected.”

 

“Obvs.”

 

“Hey, wait a minute. Can we track the transmission to the receiver?”

 

“Way ahead of you, man. When the Silent Minority recruited you, did they do it by obtaining your IP address, and then hacking your ISP’s records to find your home address?”

 

“Yeah, their message said something like that.”

 

“So…if they could do it, why can’t we? This camera transmits over Wi-Fi, so all that we need to do is track the data stream. You ever heard of a wireless sniffer?”

 

“No.”

 

“Here, check this out.” Orson snatched a laptop off his kitchen counter. As it booted up, he pulled the spy camera out of the wall. Then, with the aid of a USB adaptor, he plugged the device into his laptop. He fingered his keyboard, and the screen filled with words and numbers, a cipher that Vic found incomprehensible. 

 

“Okay, what you’re seeing here is a program that logs network traffic,” Orson explained. “As the camera streams data, this packet analyzer is able to track it, all the way back to the receiver.” He tapped the screen. “You see that? That’s their IP address. Now, if we could hack into their Internet service provider’s records, we could get the receiver’s exact address.”

 

“You can’t do it?”

 

“I’m good, but not that good. Fortunately, there’s another way.”

 

He opened a new program. “Check this out. I found this geolocation software online. I don’t even know if it’s legal. Watch.” When he entered the receiver’s IP address, crude animation sprang into existence. A world map became a continent map, then a state map, then a city map. Finally, a single property was spotlit. “That’s the one: 1456 Lake Street.”

 

“Who lives there? Can you find that out?”

 

“Actually, the place is classified as a commercial property. The property records say that it’s owned by Elger & Associates. Since I could unearth no information about that company, it’s obviously a shell. 

 

“I’m trying to follow the money trail, but I just keep uncovering more shell companies—layers and layers stretching into infinity—shareholders and boards of directors, all ghosts. Look at this: Puerto Rico, Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam, and on and on and on.”

 

“Well, let me know if you find anything.”

 

“Sure will, buddy.”   

 

A thought hit Vic: *Holy shit, I used a Wi-Fi home security camera when I killed Knut. If it’s that easy to intercept data streams, then the Silent Minority might have that footage. Man, talk about blackmail potential. I’m under the thumbs of probable Peeping Tom perverts, and I have no idea what their deal is. What the fuck am I supposed to do?*  

 

“Well, I better get goin’, Orson. My appointment is in twenty minutes and I can’t afford to miss it. If I spend another day wearing this cannibal grin, I’ll end up lipless. Thanks for your hospitality, or whatever.”

 

“No problem, pal. And hey…be careful. They know that we’re on to them now. If they could make Matilda disappear, they could just as easily ghost us.”

 

“Shit…you’re right.”

 

“As rain, and twice as plain.”

 

“Whatever.”



 

**Chapter 11**

 

Two weeks later, Vic’s fixed teeth still looked off: too damn white, glowing as if radioactive. *Man, I’m gonna need cigarettes and coffee*, he thought. *Lots and lots…enough to put some yellow on these here smilin’ ivories.* 

 

He sink-spat Scope, and then visited the living room for some channel surfing. *Well, well, well…XBC News. And what are they yammering about this morning? Nanny Gaines again, big surprise.*

 

As with the Squids takedown, the media had spun the events into a terrorism scare. Profiling each of the dead Silent, they’d elicited condemnation from ex-neighbors, former schoolmates, and even a few relatives. “I always thought there was something off about ’em,” was repeated ad nauseam, along with every variation thereof. “Too intense…too quiet.”   

 

No mention was made of the Silent Minority, or retribution for persecuted introverts. Instead: “Al-Qaeda in the United States,” “Terror in Suburbia,” “Our Children, Our Enemies,” and other headlines equally incendiary. Supposedly, the dead Silent were Muslim extremists, recruited through message boards and clandestine MMORPG communications. They’d assaulted Nanny and the Squids—*hey, not a bad band name*—because those individuals represented traditional American values. *Give me a fuckin’ break.* 

 

Never one to let a dead horse go unmolested, Nanny Gaines and her family rode their “heroics” right up the media mountain. With every passing day, *Nanny Says*’ Nielsen ratings shot further into the stratosphere, overtaking even that most sacred to the slack-jawed, the hallowed Super Bowl. XBC began rerunning her *Celebrity Dance Off* season, with speculation that Nanny would return for *Celebrity Dance Off Superstar* in a few months. 

 

Worse, the incident had made celebrities of Nanny’s two children. Prior to the Silent’s calamitous field trip, Vic had known nothing about Thad and Mimi. Now, every time that he checked the news, he found himself bombarded with news of their celebrity sweethearts, their simplistic philosophies concerning religion—“Christianity, or you’re tongue kissin’ Satan”—and every appearance they made anywhere. Similarly, he came to know and loathe Beaumont “Bucktooth” Gaines—former pastor, current realtor, and all-around dickweed.

 

Now the morning news reported that the foursome and their zany, gun-toting household staff were filming a reality show. Supposedly, *The Nanny Clan* would show the public what the Gaines’ were up to when they weren’t “fightin’ for American freedom.” 

 

*Nanny Clan?* Vic thought. *Shouldn’t they spell that with a K? And why are they only mentioning the dead Silent? What happened to the fourteen in the gimp suits? Doesn’t anybody miss them? God, I could have been one of ’em, chained up in a stable somewhere, my ass striped with flagellation marks. Maybe I should start carrying around a cyanide pill.*

 

Vic sighed. The time had come. He’d put off calling his parents for too long. *They’ve got to be back in Florida by now. What’s that number again? Oh yeah.* 

 

Three rings, and then Vic’s father answered, “Hello.” The man was panting heavily and, for a moment, Vic wondered if the skinpopper-delivered beatdown had left him debilitated.

 

“You feelin’ okay, Dad?” Vic asked. *Please let him be.*

 

“Victor, is that you? Jeez, how long has it been, boy? We thought we’d see you during our visit, but I guess you were out of town.”

 

“Yeah, something like that.” *Christ, how do I steer our discussion toward their Turquoise Street incident? If I say anything about the Silent Minority’s surveillance, they’ll call the cops, and this entire house of cards will come crashing down around me.* Instead, he repeated his question: “You feelin’ okay, Dad?”

 

“Sure, why wouldn’t I be? Oh, the panting. No worries there. We just bought ourselves a home gym, and I was doing the ol’ military press when you called. I’m really workin’ up a sweat here.” 

 

“Home gym? Aren’t you a little old for bodybuilding? Why the sudden fitness regimen?” *Admit it, Dad*, he wished to demand. *No need for pretense.*

 

“Well…you know, Vic, when a man reaches my advanced age, the tendency is to go plus-sized. You know the drill: sitting on the couch all day, drinking beer and eating junk food until one’s chest could fill a woman’s bra. I’ve been guilty of that myself, I’m sorry to admit. Recently, though, I’ve had a breakthrough. From now on, I’m dedicating two hours of every day to working out. Next time we see each other, you might just mistake me for a muscleman.”

 

*Ah, gotcha!* Vic thought triumphantly, even as he asked, “Breakthrough, huh? And what prompted this development?” *Say it. Say it.*                  

 

“A Stallone marathon, actually. If that dude can rip throats out in his sixth decade, I can at least attempt to see my member when I urinate.”

 

“Gross. You know, some things are better unvoiced. And that’s all it was then, Sylvester Stallone?”

 

“Sure, call it divine Rambolical inspiration. Watch four of those back-to-back, and you’re ready to punch the face off the first scumbag who accosts you. You should try it sometime. Oh, incidentally, your mother and I are selling the house. You have until the end of the month to move everything out, and then we’re turning the property over to a realtor.”

 

“Wait…what?”

 

“Don’t worry, my boy. We’ll set you up somewhere new. It’s just, when we were on Turquoise Street, we couldn’t help noticing how seedy it’s become. That’s not the right sort of environment for a guy like you, and it certainly isn’t the friendly block party-throwin’ neighborhood that we originally moved into. In fact, why don’t you start looking into condos? We’ll transfer you enough money for the down payment, and pay the whole thing off when the house sells.”  

 

*Should I tell him not to bother? Am I gonna be in this Silent complex forever?* “Yeah, I’ll do that, Dad. In the meantime, maybe we can put our furniture in storage.”

 

“Sure, or you can have a garage sale.”

 

“In *that* neighborhood? Those bastards will probably pay me in gang rapes.”

 

“Language, Son. Come to think of it, though, I wouldn’t put it past ’em.”

 

“Yeah, things are tough all over.”  

 

After twenty-seven more minutes of small talk, their conversation finally concluded. Hanging up, Vic released a sigh, wondering, *Okay, what the hell am I gonna do now?*



 

**Chapter 12**

 

Three months later, the Turquoise Street property had been sold. Its displaced furniture was in storage, and Vic’s bank account was overflowing. Biweekly, his parents called, asking how the condo hunt was going. “Great, great,” Vic always told them, “but I think I’m gonna keep looking.” As far as they knew, Vic was currently renting a room, one of seven individuals occupying a two-story Colonial style residence. “One of those awkward Craigslist arrangements,” he’d told them. “No, trust me, you don’t wanna visit. My roommates are frickin’ weird. Wait until I get a real place, and then we’ll throw me a little housewarming party.” 

 

Since the Nanny Gaines incident, there’d been no other Silent Minority excursions. *They’re probably recruiting new introverts,* he thought. *Replenishing our ranks.* He’d settled into a rhythm: eating delicious Beth-cooked meals, reading books and comics, and watching Blu-rays. There’d been no more recordings of his ex-neighbors. It seemed that he could finally put Turquoise Street behind him. *The Silent Minority will have to find some other way to motivate me*, he thought. 

 

Still, he was jittery. He’d been drinking too much coffee, trying to beat back slumber, reducing his shuteye interludes to exhausted twenty-minute catnaps. His reason? Behind Vic’s eyelids, the Guerros and Janssons lurked: mush-faced monstrosities screaming condemnations. Through frigid dreamscapes they pursued him. Zombielike, they lurched along his shadow trails, in a triple-month chase passing through abandoned junkyards, condemned tenements, underwater cities, corpse-filled theme parks, spectral rooms of shifting angles, and dozens of mundane backgrounds borrowed from Vic’s childhood. 

 

Unfortunately, the caffeine bombardment wasn’t much better. Phantom voices arose, vicious auditory hallucinations, a highlight reel composed of past tauntings and overheard plots. But were they really hallucinations? Had the Silent Minority impregnated Vic’s walls with tiny speakers, to pump his ear canals full of verbalized bile, so as to irrevocably warp him into their maladjusted sock puppet? 

 

The voices always seemed to emanate from the next room over. In fact, after many twilight hours spent searching out speakers, Vic’s walls now resembled Swiss cheese. He’d found four spy cameras already. Did they have speakers built in? *Must remember to ask Orson*, he reminded himself for the fourth time that morning.

 

A pressure was building within him, a powerful horniness like nothing he’d ever felt before. He feared that if he masturbated, the culmination would prove explosive enough to send Vic shooting out through his own penis, and thus leave him inside out. He’d been thinking of Beth.    

 

*I need some fresh air*, he thought. *I’m getting too repressed in here, thinking all these madman thoughts. I know, I’ll go for a drive. Where? Anywhere but here.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Don’t do it, Vic. Don’t you dare turn on that radio.* Ignoring the mental voice, Vic conjured up some road music:

 

*When I tap that dime girl’s ass*

*Ooga Booga*

*When I give your momma crabs*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bout to get up on that stab*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bitch, Ooga Booga*

*Bitch*

 

Vic laughed and switched to silence. *Aw, now they’ve gone and done it*, he thought. *They repackaged “Shamdiggly” on us. What’s next? Thugarelli? Watermellow? I just don’t get it.*  

 

At an intersection, awaiting the traffic light’s greening, he noticed a pretty face framed within his rear-view mirror. It belonged to the driver behind him. Idling in a blue Volkswagen Tiguan, she wore black lipstick, aviator sunglasses, and a lace sleeve top—no bra, it appeared. Her cheekbones were high, her breasts attractively ample. Smirking mischievously, she sang along to unheard music. Blunt brunette bangs fell just short of her eyelids. *God, look at her*, Vic thought. *I bet she’s the sexy bassist of an indie rock band, or maybe some kind of slam poet. I’d like to give her a good slamming, that’s for sure.* 

 

In the mirror, he observed her. Involuntarily, he began whispering: “Yeah, that’s right, baby. Sing for Daddy. Has Daddy’s little girl been naughty? Yeah, I bet you have. I bet you like it hard, don’t ya? I’m gonna give it to ya. Oh…yeah.” *Holy shit, did I just say that?* he wondered, alarmed. *I sound like a serial killer. And what’s with this ‘Daddy’ shit? Where the hell did that come from? Man, I hope that those Silent scumfucks don’t have my car bugged, too.*   

 

When the light turned green, Vic sped far ahead of the girl, ashamed and terrified of himself. Graffiti-coated store facades slid past him, as did a pack of geriatric rollerbladers led by four grown men riding Razor scooters. Unfortunately, Vic encountered a sexy sign spinner girl three intersections up—another long, pants-tightening red light. In a tank top and a tiny pair of jean shorts, she jiggled and pranced across the curb corner, twirling a sign advertising Chavo’s Chalupas.     

 

*Lord, help me*, Vic thought. *Petite, with a nice little bubble butt. Damn, look at that thing shake. Now she’s turning. Whoa, she’s waving at me.* Awkwardly, he waved back, but she’d already rotated toward oncoming traffic. *I wonder if she’s legal. She looks college-age, but…man. I don’t know what they’re feeding ’em these days, but it’s getting harder and harder to tell. I mean, look at those glorious tits. Speaking of ‘harder and harder,’ I better start thinking about baseball before I need a freakin’ pants change. Uh…Pete Rose…Padres…hmmm, turns out that I know nothing about baseball.* 

 

Behind him, a car horn honked. *Oh, the light is green. When did that happen?* After one last lingering glance at the sign spinner, Vic sped off. *Wait a minute. Where the hell am I going?*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Eventually, Vic parked outside a supermarket. While Beth’s cooking and the Silent Minority’s fridge-restocking elves had kept him well fed, it had been ages since he’d munched his favorite snack food or chugged his favorite beer. This time, he was going to binge. 

 

The lot was half-full, and Vic took a moment to eye-sweep its perimeter, ensuring that no Turquoise Street Irregulars were waiting to ambush him—or worse, Nanny Gaines and her gimp slaves. The coast was clear, although one disheveled vagrant shot Vic dirty looks from his tree-shaded sitting space. 

 

Pushing a squeaky-wheeled shopping cart, Vic stepped inside. From aisle to aisle he traveled, filling the cart with Cheetos and corn dogs, Skittles and Froot Loops. In the beer aisle, he went a little crazy, grabbing six-packs and twelvers, even a Newcastle mini-keg. 

 

A strange certainty fell over him: *The other shoppers are talking about me.* In the corner of his eye, he saw fingers pointing. Faintly, he heard his name whispered, attached to noun adjuncts such as “faggot,” “weirdo,” “freak” and “sicko.” Turning to identify his defamers, he saw guiltless faces staring back: children, adults and shelf stockers, none of whom seemed to recognize him. *Am I schizophrenic?* he wondered. *Am I so used to persecution that it’s become my mental soundtrack? Should I confront one of these bastards, see if they’re saying what I think they are?*       

 

He hurried to the register, and soon left the store one hundred and thirty-four dollars poorer. As he loaded up his Taurus’ trunk, Vic glanced toward the tree-shaded vagrant. The dude had sprouted a friend, a rutabaga-nosed surfer type, who sat astride a mint green beach cruiser bicycle. Both were looking in Vic’s direction, pointing and grunting. 

 

“Get out of San Diego!” the bicyclist angrily shouted. 

 

*We’re in San Diego County, not San Diego!* Vic might have shouted back. Instead, he finished loading his car. Grinning dangerously at the bum and his friend, he pushed his shopping cart to the cart corral, taking his time with it.    

 

“What are you lookin’ at, bitch?” the vagrant shouted. “Your kind don’t belong here!”

 

*My kind?* Vic wondered. *What’s he mean by that?* Still, he kept silent, keying his engine to life, pulling Killer Mike’s *R.A.P. Music* from his CD case. Skipping ahead to “Don’t Die,” he let the song build in intensity, thinking to himself, *Damn, this shit knocks. How come I never hear stuff like this on the radio?* 

 

Blasting the song at a near-deafening level, he rolled down his driver’s side window and grabbed a handful of change from the coin holder. Pulling up alongside the homeless man, he shouted, “Here, buy yourself a personality!” and chucked the coins as forcefully as he could manage. Most of the quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies sailed between the vagrant’s defensively raised palms, striking his face. Screaming, the man hopped to his feet. 

 

As Vic accelerated away, the pelted man and the bicyclist gave pursuit, shouting threats and hate speech. Laughing, Vic drove home. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two weeks later, he encountered a hassle. Anxious to escape the claustrophobic confines of the Silent Minority complex, he’d set off on yet another aimless drive. He’d cruised the coast for a while, watching surfers carve waves, perving on luscious thong-adorned women. Eventually, he’d grown famished, and found himself visiting a nearby eatery, Aggo’s Diner. The place had outdoor seating, allowing Vic to observe the ongoing flesh parade. *Whoa, look at those sexpots,* he thought, ogling a particularly buxom cluster. *Titties for days. And what’s with those scowling dudes escorting them? Are they men or shaved gorillas?*

 

Lost in solar warmth and sea scent, Vic didn’t feel half bad. In fact, he felt invisible, just another piece of beachfront scenery. When a young Hispanic waitress—neither fat nor thin, but jolly to the utmost—drifted over to take his order, Vic requested a Corona and a burger, plus curly fries. “And for the love of God, bring limes.”  

 

Minutes later, he found himself contemplating a thick Angus beef patty slathered in barbecue sauce, with fried onions atop and smoked bacon below. Between them, three slices of cheese: Swiss, American and cheddar. Gripping its sponge dough bun firmly to keep the miracle together, Vic took a bite. *Sweet Evil Grimace, that’s good!* he thought. He took a sip of beer. *Ah…refreshing. Fries in ketchup…chew and swallow.* *Oh, exalted burger, I didn’t forget about you. Damn, I say…so greasy, so succulent. It coats my heart like a sweater, prelude to a heart attack. Maybe I’ll keel over and die, and some passersby will finish off this beast. Food for thought, heh-heh.*       

 

After two more beers, Vic pushed an empty, sauce-streaked plate forward. *Maybe I’ll head to the shore and take a sand nap*, he thought, sleepy with satiation. “Check, please!” he shouted to the passing waitress.

 

When the background music changed, Vic should have taken it for an ill omen: his day was about to get fucked. An old Sublime song whose name he’d forgotten ended, segueing to something with a faster tempo. *What the hell is this shit?*Vic wondered. *Fiddles and flutes…is that a Moog? What do they even call this type of music? Folk-electropop?* The singer had a country twang; the back-up singers seemed kidnapped from an urban gospel choir. The lyrics, if they even can be described as such, went:  

 

*My name is not Jack* 

*But I can still jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*She may not be a dime*

*More like a stack of pennies*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*Not too fat and*

*Not too skinny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

Vic stuck his fingers in his ears, but the song still got through. He glanced up to see the waitress standing tableside, clutching a black imitation leather check holder. Vic stuck his debit card inside of it, and watched the gal wiggle off to swipe some plastic. She returned just as “Jack-a-ninny” ended.  

 

Her aspect had shifted. Now she looked upon Vic as if he were a large arachnid, or something equally objectionable. “Sir,” she intoned, “I’m afraid that your card’s been declined.” 

 

“Huh. Really? That’s…wait, are you saying my pockets are shallow?”

 

“Like a wading pool. Got any cash, guy? Otherwise, you’ll have to play busboy for a couple of hours. The last dude that came up light, Mr. Aggo made him scrub toilets. And that was on taco night.”

 

Luckily, Vic had a bit of cash handy. Paying the waitress, he deducted a couple of dollars from what he’d planned to tip her, and got the hell out of there. 

 

*Not the radio, you bastard*, he thought to himself. Unable to resist, he heard a DJ introduce Zip-Loke’s latest track, “Dem Showah Boyz.” *No way can this be what I think it is*, Vic thought. But those expecting the worst are rarely disappointed, and thus the lyrics went:

 

*Crackas lookin’ at a nigga like what*

*Crackas ’bout ta get funked in the butt* 

*Den dat soap gets ta droppin’*

*And Zip-Loke gets ta poppin’*

*And dem crackas walkin’ like they got stuck*

 

*Wow,* Vic marveled. *Just…wow.* Then he remembered the debit card, and his countenance clouded over.

*Apartment 13*, Vic thought, knocking softly. *Let’s see what this character has to say.* The door swung open, revealing Orson in a Miley Cyrus shirt. 

 

“Hey there, buddy,” Orson yelped, engulfing Vic in an onion-stench bear hug. “I’ve so much to show you.”

 

Following him into the apartment, Vic said, “Yeah, yeah, let’s make it quick, pal. I’ve got a dentist appointment later, and I don’t wanna miss it. I’ve already damn near chewed my own lips off. You know, I—” 

 

Vic had expected Orson’s apartment to be a stereotypical lurker lair, wallpapered with newspaper cutouts, marked city maps, and stalker-shot photographs. *Or at least filled with baby bottles, like in that awesome Peter Straub story. What was the name of it? Oh yeah, “The Buffalo Hunter.”* He certainly hadn’t expected:   

 

Were one to step into the center of Orson’s living room and then spin themselves into a slow rotation, they’d have witnessed an apartment divided into twelve segments, each decorated with a holiday theme. 

 

Every bit of wall space bore ornamentation. January’s sliver was filled with domino masks, confetti and noisemakers—New Year’s, obviously. While one might have expected the February sliver to focus on Valentine’s Day, tiered display shelves occupied that bit of wall space, each exhibiting an assortment of stuffed groundhogs. *Did Orson do the taxidermy work himself?* Vic wondered.     

 

For March, Orson had selected Saint Patrick’s Day, with shamrocks, leprechauns, and Guinness Draught posters aplenty. April was another taxidermy exhibition—rabbits, this time—alongside a multicolored plastic egg collection. May was a collage of photographs, each featuring a broad-faced, homely woman. June too was all photographs, this time presenting a sickly, liver-spotted man. *Mother’s Day and Father’s Day*, Vic guessed. The floor felt as if it were rearing up under him—a spooked stallion attempting to buck Vic into Earth’s exosphere. 

 

July was all fireworks, stars and stripes. August was dedicated to V-J Day, with that iconic nurse-kissing sailor print juxtaposed with newspapers trumpeting Japan’s surrender, and posters of mushroom clouds over Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 

 

September’s sliver was highly offensive. For some reason, Orson had chosen to highlight 9/11: Twin Towers burning, United Airlines banners, turbans, and a faux-autographed Osama bin Laden portrait. Just looking at it made Vic nauseous. 

 

Fortunately, October, November, and December were as expected: jack-o’-lanterns, turkeys, ornaments, ghouls, pilgrims, reindeers, gifts, candy wrappers, a white-bearded fat man, and an overflowing cornucopia. Still… 

 

In the face of such madness, Vic’s first thought was to spout incongruity: “Do crocodile clowns cry phosphorescent tears?” a query that Orson would have likely attached strange significance to. Instead, Vic lamely blurted, “Uh…happy holidays.”

 

*“Happy holidays?”* he thought. *This guy’s gonna skin you alive, man. Why the fuck did I come here? In the realm of the Silent, it doesn’t matter if my screams are heard. They’d rather ignore ’em than attempt any rescues. Run for the hills, Vic, or maybe Hill Street, where that terrible rap song promised that twerk-proficient sluts dwell. Makin’ it clap, wubba wubba.*     

 

“Have you checked the news yet?” Orson asked, flushed with repressed exhilaration. 

 

“You know, it completely escaped my mind. Pretty much all I’ve done today is swallow my own blood. Here, take a look at this.” He peeled his lips back, revealing their well-gnawed inner linings. 

 

“Yowza. You know, I got some vinegar you can chug. Perhaps with a couple squirts of fresh lemon juice.”

 

“Asshole.” *Okay, we’re joking around now. Maybe this future mall Santa isn’t gonna make a thong bikini out of me just yet. In fact, I’m just gonna ask it.* “Dude, what the hell is going on with your interior decorating? Are you some kind of recovering Jehovah’s Witness or something?”

 

“What, you disapprove?”

 

“I don’t even know where to start, man.” 

 

“It’s actually quite simple, friend. Holidays bring people together, yeah? All over the world, the holiday spirit infects folks with celebratory mood shades. But is it the date itself that does it? Do you feel nothing on December 23rd? No, man, it’s the whole damn season—the preceding weeks, plus the two-day aftermath. It’s the decorations, the imagery, the clothes, and the jingles. But guess what, Buttercup. You can feel it every day. Hell, you can feel several holidays at once.”

 

“Yeah…that sounds pretty stupid.” 

 

“Oh, I’ll make a convert out of you yet. Hey, what did ya say your name was?”

 

“Vic. Vic Dickens.”

 

“Victor…sounds about right. So, are you ready to peel the Silent Minority’s skin back, to see the gremlins operating behind the scenes?”

 

“Just as long as ‘gremlins’ isn’t code for ‘kidnapped children,’ I don’t see the harm in it.”

 

“Children? Can’t stand the little bastards.”

 

“Me neither. Let’s ship ’em all to an island, along with their moronic parents.”

 

“Yeah, except maybe the boats mysteriously sink halfway. No survivors.”

 

“I like the way you think, bro.”

 

“We’re like mental mirrors reflecting each other’s thoughts at this point.”

 

“Yeah, well…anyway, maybe you can drop a little knowledge on me. I do have that appointment to get to.”  

 

“Sure, sure. Places to go, people to be. I know the drill. Hey, remember Matilda Grieves, that trigger-happy babe on the bus?”

 

“That broad would be tough to forget. I mean, come on, she shot that kid yesterday, and pointed her Ruger right at me.”

 

“Sure did. Remember what she was shouting? ‘Why do you watch me?’ and all that.”

 

“Yeah…”

 

“Guess what, friend. They *are* watchin’ us.”

 

Judging by Orson’s expression, it seemed that he expected Vic to gasp. Instead, Vic replied, “No shit, dumbass. That’s how I got recruited into this turkey shoot to begin with.”

 

“Okay, okay. But did you know that they’re *always* watchin’ us? In the bathroom, as we sleep, everywhere at all times.”    

 

“Yeah, I figured as much. They’re following my neighbors, too. I don’t know how far up this thing goes, but it’s definitely bigger than a pack of disgruntled introverts. I mean, the cost and the resources involved. It’s like the NSA or something. There’s a bigger picture here, but what is it?”

 

“That’s the question, Victor. Here, check this out.”

 

Dragging an armchair to where two walls met the ceiling, Orson used his apartment key to pry an object out of a tiny crevice therein. Stepping closer, Vic saw a lens within a black plastic tube. Four wires trailed out from it—red, white, yellow and black—attached to something within the walls. 

 

“Is that what I think it is?”

 

“Sure is. You’re looking at a high definition micro spy camera, broadcasting wirelessly to our overseers. Two days ago, I swept this place with a radio frequency detector. These things are all over my apartment—I’ve counted seven thus far. I’m sure that your apartment is filled with ’em, too.”

 

“Damn…” Vic muttered, wondering how many hours of joyless masturbation they’d filmed of him. “I don’t even know what to say.” 

 

“That’s not all, partner. See this little serial number on the side here? This is the latest Investutech model. These things don’t even hit the market until next year. 4K resolution, man, with infrared lenses that slide on in the darkness. Seriously, I’d like to get a few of these installed in that ladies gym down the street…you know, the one where all the hot girls go, where creeps like us are turned away at the door. Man, I could beat myself dry.”

 

“Yeah, whoever’s in charge of this weirdness is obviously connected.”

 

“Obvs.”

 

“Hey, wait a minute. Can we track the transmission to the receiver?”

 

“Way ahead of you, man. When the Silent Minority recruited you, did they do it by obtaining your IP address, and then hacking your ISP’s records to find your home address?”

 

“Yeah, their message said something like that.”

 

“So…if they could do it, why can’t we? This camera transmits over Wi-Fi, so all that we need to do is track the data stream. You ever heard of a wireless sniffer?”

 

“No.”

 

“Here, check this out.” Orson snatched a laptop off his kitchen counter. As it booted up, he pulled the spy camera out of the wall. Then, with the aid of a USB adaptor, he plugged the device into his laptop. He fingered his keyboard, and the screen filled with words and numbers, a cipher that Vic found incomprehensible. 

 

“Okay, what you’re seeing here is a program that logs network traffic,” Orson explained. “As the camera streams data, this packet analyzer is able to track it, all the way back to the receiver.” He tapped the screen. “You see that? That’s their IP address. Now, if we could hack into their Internet service provider’s records, we could get the receiver’s exact address.”

 

“You can’t do it?”

 

“I’m good, but not that good. Fortunately, there’s another way.”

 

He opened a new program. “Check this out. I found this geolocation software online. I don’t even know if it’s legal. Watch.” When he entered the receiver’s IP address, crude animation sprang into existence. A world map became a continent map, then a state map, then a city map. Finally, a single property was spotlit. “That’s the one: 1456 Lake Street.”

 

“Who lives there? Can you find that out?”

 

“Actually, the place is classified as a commercial property. The property records say that it’s owned by Elger & Associates. Since I could unearth no information about that company, it’s obviously a shell. 

 

“I’m trying to follow the money trail, but I just keep uncovering more shell companies—layers and layers stretching into infinity—shareholders and boards of directors, all ghosts. Look at this: Puerto Rico, Ireland, Luxembourg, Singapore, Amsterdam, and on and on and on.”

 

“Well, let me know if you find anything.”

 

“Sure will, buddy.”   

 

A thought hit Vic: *Holy shit, I used a Wi-Fi home security camera when I killed Knut. If it’s that easy to intercept data streams, then the Silent Minority might have that footage. Man, talk about blackmail potential. I’m under the thumbs of probable Peeping Tom perverts, and I have no idea what their deal is. What the fuck am I supposed to do?*  

 

“Well, I better get goin’, Orson. My appointment is in twenty minutes and I can’t afford to miss it. If I spend another day wearing this cannibal grin, I’ll end up lipless. Thanks for your hospitality, or whatever.”

 

“No problem, pal. And hey…be careful. They know that we’re on to them now. If they could make Matilda disappear, they could just as easily ghost us.”

 

“Shit…you’re right.”

 

“As rain, and twice as plain.”

 

“Whatever.”



 

**Chapter 11**

 

Two weeks later, Vic’s fixed teeth still looked off: too damn white, glowing as if radioactive. *Man, I’m gonna need cigarettes and coffee*, he thought. *Lots and lots…enough to put some yellow on these here smilin’ ivories.* 

 

He sink-spat Scope, and then visited the living room for some channel surfing. *Well, well, well…XBC News. And what are they yammering about this morning? Nanny Gaines again, big surprise.*

 

As with the Squids takedown, the media had spun the events into a terrorism scare. Profiling each of the dead Silent, they’d elicited condemnation from ex-neighbors, former schoolmates, and even a few relatives. “I always thought there was something off about ’em,” was repeated ad nauseam, along with every variation thereof. “Too intense…too quiet.”   

 

No mention was made of the Silent Minority, or retribution for persecuted introverts. Instead: “Al-Qaeda in the United States,” “Terror in Suburbia,” “Our Children, Our Enemies,” and other headlines equally incendiary. Supposedly, the dead Silent were Muslim extremists, recruited through message boards and clandestine MMORPG communications. They’d assaulted Nanny and the Squids—*hey, not a bad band name*—because those individuals represented traditional American values. *Give me a fuckin’ break.* 

 

Never one to let a dead horse go unmolested, Nanny Gaines and her family rode their “heroics” right up the media mountain. With every passing day, *Nanny Says*’ Nielsen ratings shot further into the stratosphere, overtaking even that most sacred to the slack-jawed, the hallowed Super Bowl. XBC began rerunning her *Celebrity Dance Off* season, with speculation that Nanny would return for *Celebrity Dance Off Superstar* in a few months. 

 

Worse, the incident had made celebrities of Nanny’s two children. Prior to the Silent’s calamitous field trip, Vic had known nothing about Thad and Mimi. Now, every time that he checked the news, he found himself bombarded with news of their celebrity sweethearts, their simplistic philosophies concerning religion—“Christianity, or you’re tongue kissin’ Satan”—and every appearance they made anywhere. Similarly, he came to know and loathe Beaumont “Bucktooth” Gaines—former pastor, current realtor, and all-around dickweed.

 

Now the morning news reported that the foursome and their zany, gun-toting household staff were filming a reality show. Supposedly, *The Nanny Clan* would show the public what the Gaines’ were up to when they weren’t “fightin’ for American freedom.” 

 

*Nanny Clan?* Vic thought. *Shouldn’t they spell that with a K? And why are they only mentioning the dead Silent? What happened to the fourteen in the gimp suits? Doesn’t anybody miss them? God, I could have been one of ’em, chained up in a stable somewhere, my ass striped with flagellation marks. Maybe I should start carrying around a cyanide pill.*

 

Vic sighed. The time had come. He’d put off calling his parents for too long. *They’ve got to be back in Florida by now. What’s that number again? Oh yeah.* 

 

Three rings, and then Vic’s father answered, “Hello.” The man was panting heavily and, for a moment, Vic wondered if the skinpopper-delivered beatdown had left him debilitated.

 

“You feelin’ okay, Dad?” Vic asked. *Please let him be.*

 

“Victor, is that you? Jeez, how long has it been, boy? We thought we’d see you during our visit, but I guess you were out of town.”

 

“Yeah, something like that.” *Christ, how do I steer our discussion toward their Turquoise Street incident? If I say anything about the Silent Minority’s surveillance, they’ll call the cops, and this entire house of cards will come crashing down around me.* Instead, he repeated his question: “You feelin’ okay, Dad?”

 

“Sure, why wouldn’t I be? Oh, the panting. No worries there. We just bought ourselves a home gym, and I was doing the ol’ military press when you called. I’m really workin’ up a sweat here.” 

 

“Home gym? Aren’t you a little old for bodybuilding? Why the sudden fitness regimen?” *Admit it, Dad*, he wished to demand. *No need for pretense.*

 

“Well…you know, Vic, when a man reaches my advanced age, the tendency is to go plus-sized. You know the drill: sitting on the couch all day, drinking beer and eating junk food until one’s chest could fill a woman’s bra. I’ve been guilty of that myself, I’m sorry to admit. Recently, though, I’ve had a breakthrough. From now on, I’m dedicating two hours of every day to working out. Next time we see each other, you might just mistake me for a muscleman.”

 

*Ah, gotcha!* Vic thought triumphantly, even as he asked, “Breakthrough, huh? And what prompted this development?” *Say it. Say it.*                  

 

“A Stallone marathon, actually. If that dude can rip throats out in his sixth decade, I can at least attempt to see my member when I urinate.”

 

“Gross. You know, some things are better unvoiced. And that’s all it was then, Sylvester Stallone?”

 

“Sure, call it divine Rambolical inspiration. Watch four of those back-to-back, and you’re ready to punch the face off the first scumbag who accosts you. You should try it sometime. Oh, incidentally, your mother and I are selling the house. You have until the end of the month to move everything out, and then we’re turning the property over to a realtor.”

 

“Wait…what?”

 

“Don’t worry, my boy. We’ll set you up somewhere new. It’s just, when we were on Turquoise Street, we couldn’t help noticing how seedy it’s become. That’s not the right sort of environment for a guy like you, and it certainly isn’t the friendly block party-throwin’ neighborhood that we originally moved into. In fact, why don’t you start looking into condos? We’ll transfer you enough money for the down payment, and pay the whole thing off when the house sells.”  

 

*Should I tell him not to bother? Am I gonna be in this Silent complex forever?* “Yeah, I’ll do that, Dad. In the meantime, maybe we can put our furniture in storage.”

 

“Sure, or you can have a garage sale.”

 

“In *that* neighborhood? Those bastards will probably pay me in gang rapes.”

 

“Language, Son. Come to think of it, though, I wouldn’t put it past ’em.”

 

“Yeah, things are tough all over.”  

 

After twenty-seven more minutes of small talk, their conversation finally concluded. Hanging up, Vic released a sigh, wondering, *Okay, what the hell am I gonna do now?*



 

**Chapter 12**

 

Three months later, the Turquoise Street property had been sold. Its displaced furniture was in storage, and Vic’s bank account was overflowing. Biweekly, his parents called, asking how the condo hunt was going. “Great, great,” Vic always told them, “but I think I’m gonna keep looking.” As far as they knew, Vic was currently renting a room, one of seven individuals occupying a two-story Colonial style residence. “One of those awkward Craigslist arrangements,” he’d told them. “No, trust me, you don’t wanna visit. My roommates are frickin’ weird. Wait until I get a real place, and then we’ll throw me a little housewarming party.” 

 

Since the Nanny Gaines incident, there’d been no other Silent Minority excursions. *They’re probably recruiting new introverts,* he thought. *Replenishing our ranks.* He’d settled into a rhythm: eating delicious Beth-cooked meals, reading books and comics, and watching Blu-rays. There’d been no more recordings of his ex-neighbors. It seemed that he could finally put Turquoise Street behind him. *The Silent Minority will have to find some other way to motivate me*, he thought. 

 

Still, he was jittery. He’d been drinking too much coffee, trying to beat back slumber, reducing his shuteye interludes to exhausted twenty-minute catnaps. His reason? Behind Vic’s eyelids, the Guerros and Janssons lurked: mush-faced monstrosities screaming condemnations. Through frigid dreamscapes they pursued him. Zombielike, they lurched along his shadow trails, in a triple-month chase passing through abandoned junkyards, condemned tenements, underwater cities, corpse-filled theme parks, spectral rooms of shifting angles, and dozens of mundane backgrounds borrowed from Vic’s childhood. 

 

Unfortunately, the caffeine bombardment wasn’t much better. Phantom voices arose, vicious auditory hallucinations, a highlight reel composed of past tauntings and overheard plots. But were they really hallucinations? Had the Silent Minority impregnated Vic’s walls with tiny speakers, to pump his ear canals full of verbalized bile, so as to irrevocably warp him into their maladjusted sock puppet? 

 

The voices always seemed to emanate from the next room over. In fact, after many twilight hours spent searching out speakers, Vic’s walls now resembled Swiss cheese. He’d found four spy cameras already. Did they have speakers built in? *Must remember to ask Orson*, he reminded himself for the fourth time that morning.

 

A pressure was building within him, a powerful horniness like nothing he’d ever felt before. He feared that if he masturbated, the culmination would prove explosive enough to send Vic shooting out through his own penis, and thus leave him inside out. He’d been thinking of Beth.    

 

*I need some fresh air*, he thought. *I’m getting too repressed in here, thinking all these madman thoughts. I know, I’ll go for a drive. Where? Anywhere but here.* 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

*Don’t do it, Vic. Don’t you dare turn on that radio.* Ignoring the mental voice, Vic conjured up some road music:

 

*When I tap that dime girl’s ass*

*Ooga Booga*

*When I give your momma crabs*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bout to get up on that stab*

*Ooga Booga*

*Bitch, Ooga Booga*

*Bitch*

 

Vic laughed and switched to silence. *Aw, now they’ve gone and done it*, he thought. *They repackaged “Shamdiggly” on us. What’s next? Thugarelli? Watermellow? I just don’t get it.*  

 

At an intersection, awaiting the traffic light’s greening, he noticed a pretty face framed within his rear-view mirror. It belonged to the driver behind him. Idling in a blue Volkswagen Tiguan, she wore black lipstick, aviator sunglasses, and a lace sleeve top—no bra, it appeared. Her cheekbones were high, her breasts attractively ample. Smirking mischievously, she sang along to unheard music. Blunt brunette bangs fell just short of her eyelids. *God, look at her*, Vic thought. *I bet she’s the sexy bassist of an indie rock band, or maybe some kind of slam poet. I’d like to give her a good slamming, that’s for sure.* 

 

In the mirror, he observed her. Involuntarily, he began whispering: “Yeah, that’s right, baby. Sing for Daddy. Has Daddy’s little girl been naughty? Yeah, I bet you have. I bet you like it hard, don’t ya? I’m gonna give it to ya. Oh…yeah.” *Holy shit, did I just say that?* he wondered, alarmed. *I sound like a serial killer. And what’s with this ‘Daddy’ shit? Where the hell did that come from? Man, I hope that those Silent scumfucks don’t have my car bugged, too.*   

 

When the light turned green, Vic sped far ahead of the girl, ashamed and terrified of himself. Graffiti-coated store facades slid past him, as did a pack of geriatric rollerbladers led by four grown men riding Razor scooters. Unfortunately, Vic encountered a sexy sign spinner girl three intersections up—another long, pants-tightening red light. In a tank top and a tiny pair of jean shorts, she jiggled and pranced across the curb corner, twirling a sign advertising Chavo’s Chalupas.     

 

*Lord, help me*, Vic thought. *Petite, with a nice little bubble butt. Damn, look at that thing shake. Now she’s turning. Whoa, she’s waving at me.* Awkwardly, he waved back, but she’d already rotated toward oncoming traffic. *I wonder if she’s legal. She looks college-age, but…man. I don’t know what they’re feeding ’em these days, but it’s getting harder and harder to tell. I mean, look at those glorious tits. Speaking of ‘harder and harder,’ I better start thinking about baseball before I need a freakin’ pants change. Uh…Pete Rose…Padres…hmmm, turns out that I know nothing about baseball.* 

 

Behind him, a car horn honked. *Oh, the light is green. When did that happen?* After one last lingering glance at the sign spinner, Vic sped off. *Wait a minute. Where the hell am I going?*

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Eventually, Vic parked outside a supermarket. While Beth’s cooking and the Silent Minority’s fridge-restocking elves had kept him well fed, it had been ages since he’d munched his favorite snack food or chugged his favorite beer. This time, he was going to binge. 

 

The lot was half-full, and Vic took a moment to eye-sweep its perimeter, ensuring that no Turquoise Street Irregulars were waiting to ambush him—or worse, Nanny Gaines and her gimp slaves. The coast was clear, although one disheveled vagrant shot Vic dirty looks from his tree-shaded sitting space. 

 

Pushing a squeaky-wheeled shopping cart, Vic stepped inside. From aisle to aisle he traveled, filling the cart with Cheetos and corn dogs, Skittles and Froot Loops. In the beer aisle, he went a little crazy, grabbing six-packs and twelvers, even a Newcastle mini-keg. 

 

A strange certainty fell over him: *The other shoppers are talking about me.* In the corner of his eye, he saw fingers pointing. Faintly, he heard his name whispered, attached to noun adjuncts such as “faggot,” “weirdo,” “freak” and “sicko.” Turning to identify his defamers, he saw guiltless faces staring back: children, adults and shelf stockers, none of whom seemed to recognize him. *Am I schizophrenic?* he wondered. *Am I so used to persecution that it’s become my mental soundtrack? Should I confront one of these bastards, see if they’re saying what I think they are?*       

 

He hurried to the register, and soon left the store one hundred and thirty-four dollars poorer. As he loaded up his Taurus’ trunk, Vic glanced toward the tree-shaded vagrant. The dude had sprouted a friend, a rutabaga-nosed surfer type, who sat astride a mint green beach cruiser bicycle. Both were looking in Vic’s direction, pointing and grunting. 

 

“Get out of San Diego!” the bicyclist angrily shouted. 

 

*We’re in San Diego County, not San Diego!* Vic might have shouted back. Instead, he finished loading his car. Grinning dangerously at the bum and his friend, he pushed his shopping cart to the cart corral, taking his time with it.    

 

“What are you lookin’ at, bitch?” the vagrant shouted. “Your kind don’t belong here!”

 

*My kind?* Vic wondered. *What’s he mean by that?* Still, he kept silent, keying his engine to life, pulling Killer Mike’s *R.A.P. Music* from his CD case. Skipping ahead to “Don’t Die,” he let the song build in intensity, thinking to himself, *Damn, this shit knocks. How come I never hear stuff like this on the radio?* 

 

Blasting the song at a near-deafening level, he rolled down his driver’s side window and grabbed a handful of change from the coin holder. Pulling up alongside the homeless man, he shouted, “Here, buy yourself a personality!” and chucked the coins as forcefully as he could manage. Most of the quarters, nickels, dimes and pennies sailed between the vagrant’s defensively raised palms, striking his face. Screaming, the man hopped to his feet. 

 

As Vic accelerated away, the pelted man and the bicyclist gave pursuit, shouting threats and hate speech. Laughing, Vic drove home. 

 

\* \* \* \* \*

 

Two weeks later, he encountered a hassle. Anxious to escape the claustrophobic confines of the Silent Minority complex, he’d set off on yet another aimless drive. He’d cruised the coast for a while, watching surfers carve waves, perving on luscious thong-adorned women. Eventually, he’d grown famished, and found himself visiting a nearby eatery, Aggo’s Diner. The place had outdoor seating, allowing Vic to observe the ongoing flesh parade. *Whoa, look at those sexpots,* he thought, ogling a particularly buxom cluster. *Titties for days. And what’s with those scowling dudes escorting them? Are they men or shaved gorillas?*

 

Lost in solar warmth and sea scent, Vic didn’t feel half bad. In fact, he felt invisible, just another piece of beachfront scenery. When a young Hispanic waitress—neither fat nor thin, but jolly to the utmost—drifted over to take his order, Vic requested a Corona and a burger, plus curly fries. “And for the love of God, bring limes.”  

 

Minutes later, he found himself contemplating a thick Angus beef patty slathered in barbecue sauce, with fried onions atop and smoked bacon below. Between them, three slices of cheese: Swiss, American and cheddar. Gripping its sponge dough bun firmly to keep the miracle together, Vic took a bite. *Sweet Evil Grimace, that’s good!* he thought. He took a sip of beer. *Ah…refreshing. Fries in ketchup…chew and swallow.* *Oh, exalted burger, I didn’t forget about you. Damn, I say…so greasy, so succulent. It coats my heart like a sweater, prelude to a heart attack. Maybe I’ll keel over and die, and some passersby will finish off this beast. Food for thought, heh-heh.*       

 

After two more beers, Vic pushed an empty, sauce-streaked plate forward. *Maybe I’ll head to the shore and take a sand nap*, he thought, sleepy with satiation. “Check, please!” he shouted to the passing waitress.

 

When the background music changed, Vic should have taken it for an ill omen: his day was about to get fucked. An old Sublime song whose name he’d forgotten ended, segueing to something with a faster tempo. *What the hell is this shit?*Vic wondered. *Fiddles and flutes…is that a Moog? What do they even call this type of music? Folk-electropop?* The singer had a country twang; the back-up singers seemed kidnapped from an urban gospel choir. The lyrics, if they even can be described as such, went:  

 

*My name is not Jack* 

*But I can still jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*She may not be a dime*

*More like a stack of pennies*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

*Not too fat and*

*Not too skinny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

*Jack-a-ninny, jack-a-ninny*

 

Vic stuck his fingers in his ears, but the song still got through. He glanced up to see the waitress standing tableside, clutching a black imitation leather check holder. Vic stuck his debit card inside of it, and watched the gal wiggle off to swipe some plastic. She returned just as “Jack-a-ninny” ended.  

 

Her aspect had shifted. Now she looked upon Vic as if he were a large arachnid, or something equally objectionable. “Sir,” she intoned, “I’m afraid that your card’s been declined.” 

 

“Huh. Really? That’s…wait, are you saying my pockets are shallow?”

 

“Like a wading pool. Got any cash, guy? Otherwise, you’ll have to play busboy for a couple of hours. The last dude that came up light, Mr. Aggo made him scrub toilets. And that was on taco night.”

 

Luckily, Vic had a bit of cash handy. Paying the waitress, he deducted a couple of dollars from what he’d planned to tip her, and got the hell out of there. 

 

*Not the radio, you bastard*, he thought to himself. Unable to resist, he heard a DJ introduce Zip-Loke’s latest track, “Dem Showah Boyz.” *No way can this be what I think it is*, Vic thought. But those expecting the worst are rarely disappointed, and thus the lyrics went:

 

*Crackas lookin’ at a nigga like what*

*Crackas ’bout ta get funked in the butt* 

*Den dat soap gets ta droppin’*

*And Zip-Loke gets ta poppin’*

*And dem crackas walkin’ like they got stuck*

 

*Wow,* Vic marveled. *Just…wow.* Then he remembered the debit card, and his countenance clouded over.

And, adding to that, the cafe tables that are the size of a large pizza are totally antithetical, even downright hostile, to sharing!

Here’s a question - why doesn’t Variety put in coffee shop size two tops or work station type long tabes? First, they’ve got the room. Second, the people camping out there would have to share the space instead of taking over one tiny table and two chairs.

And honestly, opening an app, tapping 5 buttons, selecting categories… it’s too much friction. So I’d stop tracking altogether.

I just wanted something as simple as writing in a notebook.

So I made [BudgetNotes ](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.budget.notes)— where budgeting works exactly like writing notes.

For example, you can just type:

15 Maggi  
40 Coffee  
120 Cab

And it automatically becomes a budget list with totals. No forms. No categories. No friction.

What I personally find useful is that you can also write thoughts next to expenses. Like:

300 Headphones  
→ didn’t really need this

It makes you more aware of your spending over time.

Other things students might like:  
• Works offline (no account needed)  
• Private — your data stays on your device  
• Organised like notebook sections (Hostel, Monthly, Trip, etc.)  
• Backup & restore anytime.

I’m amicably divorced with kids, not wanting any more of my own. Before 2021, my dating life was pretty robust. I was married in the early 2000s, so I totally missed the heyday of dating apps until I got on them in the late 2010s. It seemed like women were more engaging, and also willing to meet even if it was just for coffee or a quick drink to gauge interest.

My luck was so great that it even led to a long-term relationship lasting around four years and an engagement (albeit briefly)! Unfortunately, it did not work out as she moved abroad for work and I had to remain here to be closer to my (now) late mother and children. 

I decided to take break from dating for a few years. I bought a home. Focused more on me and my kiddos. 

Since getting back on ""the market,"" I've just noticed the air to completely change. In my city (which is a large metropolitan area in the USA) I've just noticed that people are less engaged on dating apps. Recently, I bit the bullet and went to a speed dating event for late 30s - early 50s. Many of the women there I found to either be in a different state of life from me (wishing to be child-free or wanting children of their own) or they were there to wingman their friends. 

My sister gave me some encouragement: you've had relationships before and dated pretty successfully in the past so, just keep doing it.

I’m curious if anyone else has noticed this general sense of disinterest since the pandemic, where it feels like fewer people are truly available or willing to engage in dating seriously. It has seriously left me puzzled. ",14,1771268850.0,datingoverforty,46,0.82,False

There are so many people on here, and I’m always reading everyone’s stories—I’ve shared my own before too. It really feels like back problems are only truly understood by those who’ve experienced them or are currently going through them.

1r6io3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoundandExpose/comments/1r6io3e/aita_for_calling_my_husbands_secret_second_family/,AITA for calling my husband's secret second family during our divorce after he said 'you were always the better parent anyway' to justify 9 years of abandonment?,"He handed me a birthday card signed ""Love, Daddy"" with a stick figure family drawn in crayon - two adults, three kids - and none of those kids were ours.

I found it in his car when I was looking for the registration after getting pulled over. He'd been ""traveling for work"" for eight years. Regional sales manager, he said. Gone three weeks out of every month. I believed him because why wouldn't I? We had three kids under ten and I was drowning in soccer practices and parent-teacher conferences and trying to keep the house from falling apart.

The card was in a Walmart bag shoved under the passenger seat. There was also a receipt for children's Tylenol, pull-ups size 5, and a stuffed elephant. Our youngest was seven. We didn't need pull-ups.

I took a picture of everything and put it back exactly where I found it.

That night when he called from ""the hotel in Memphis,"" I asked him what our kids were doing right then. He said something generic about hoping they were asleep. I told him our youngest had just lost her first tooth and was waiting up to show him the gap when he FaceTimed. He stuttered. Said his phone was dying. The call dropped.

I hired a private investigator the next day.

Turns out Memphis wasn't Memphis. It was a suburb two states over where he had a whole other life. A wife - not legally, obviously, since we were actually married - and three kids. The oldest was nine. Which meant he started this when our second child was a baby and I was in the hospital recovering from a C-section.

The investigator gave me photos. Him at a park pushing a toddler on a swing. Him at a grocery store with a woman's arm around his waist. Him carrying a car seat into a house that wasn't ours. He looked happy. More relaxed than I'd seen him in years.

I waited until he came home for his week with us. Didn't say anything the first two days. Just watched him play dad. Help with homework. Make pancakes on Saturday morning. Our kids adored him because he was fun when he was around. And I was always the one enforcing bedtimes and dealing with meltdowns and making sure teeth got brushed.

On Sunday I put the photos on the kitchen table while he was in the shower.

When he came downstairs I was sitting there with coffee. He saw the pictures and went pale. Actually stumbled backward into the counter.

""How long have you known,"" he said. Not a question. Flat.

""Two weeks. How long has it been going on?""

He sat down. Looked at his hands. ""Nine years.""

""Do they know about us?""

""She thinks I'm divorced. That I have the kids every other weekend and they just don't want to meet her yet.""

I laughed. Couldn't help it. ""So you're lying to everyone.""

""It's complicated.""

""It's really not. You have two families. You built a whole second life while I raised our kids alone.""

He got defensive then. Said I knew what I was signing up for when I married him. That his job required travel and I'd agreed to handle things at home. That he sent money every month and wasn't that enough?

I told him he could leave right now or I could call the woman in the photos and tell her everything while he listened.

He said, ""You were always the better parent anyway.""

Just like that. Like it justified everything. Like being good at something I never wanted to do alone made it okay that he chose to be somewhere else.

I called her anyway. Put it on speaker. She answered and I said, ""Hi, this is the wife of the man you've been living with for nine years. The legal wife. We have three kids together and I have photos of him with yours. I'm sending them now.""

He tried to grab my phone. I moved. She was screaming on the other end, asking if this was some kind of joke. I sent the photos. Our wedding pictures. Birth certificates with his name on them. Everything.

Then I hung up and called my lawyer.

The divorce was brutal but fast. He tried to argue for custody. Said he wanted his weekends with the kids. My lawyer brought up abandonment and presented eight years of credit card receipts proving he spent more money in the other state than he ever did on us. Bank statements showing he had a separate account I didn't know about. Evidence that he'd been maintaining two households while telling me we needed to budget.

The judge asked my kids who they wanted to live with. They were old enough to have a say. All three of them chose me without hesitating. Not because I turned them against him. Because I was the one who'd been there. Every day. For everything.

He fell apart in court when the judge read the custody order. Full custody to me. Supervised visitation for him until he could prove he was reliable. Which he couldn't because he had another family to deal with and apparently that woman wanted nothing to do with him now either.

His parents called me crying. Begged me to let them see the kids. I said sure, as long as they acknowledged that their son abandoned his family. They did. They've been helpful ever since. Even testified about how often I called them asking where he really was because his stories didn't add up.

He moved back to the other state. Sends child support now because the court garnishes his wages. Hasn't asked for visitation in four months. The kids stopped asking about him after the first month. They're doing better now. Therapy helped. So did finally having a stable routine without wondering when he'd randomly appear and disappear again.

I got a message from him last week. Said he was sorry. That he knew he messed up. That maybe someday the kids would forgive him. I didn't respond.

But I keep thinking about what he said. ""You were always the better parent anyway."" Like it was some kind of compliment. Like I should be grateful he recognized it. Like it made everything okay that he chose to leave us.

He was right though. I was the better parent. That's why they chose me.

Am I wrong for not letting him try to fix things now?

While their friendship wasn't overtly inappropriate, there were clear indicators that crossed appropriate boundaries: they'd text late at night and they both excluded me from things that I could have been invited to.

I went out of my way to be friendly to support his new friendship. We invited her over for dinner, I got her number and invited her to a holiday party we were having, I would start conversations when I'd run into her at their workplace.

She put 0 effort in return, never once has texted me other than to acknowledge the bare minimum if I texted her. She did not say hello or bye or thank me for inviting her to our holiday party and was more interested in talking to my husband than getting to know me. Most egregious was when I was in labor and she knew we were in the hospital, she texted my husband that she was high on drugs. I feel incredibly disrespected by her behavior and my husband has cut her off, saying that their friendship was inconsiderate of me (which is largely his fault because we're married) while also noting what she did that was inappropriate.

According to my husband, she was more upset with him for not telling her to include me more and only took some responsibility. She said she doesn't have a lot of married friends and didn't know the etiquette, didn't realize texting late at night would be upsetting to me but she can see how it could be uncomfortable, and recognized that she didn't try at all. She noted that she was intimidated by me and felt like she couldn't relate to me as a wife, mother and business owner, which is frustrating for me because she never tried.

Now she wants to get coffee I presume to apologize to me but I don't have any interest in continuing a relationship with someone who has disrespected me. Is that unfair, should I hear her out?

I’m a 36F, new-ish to the Rochester area hoping to meet some friends. Making friends as an adult is weirdly harder than it should be, so here I am unashamedly turning to Reddit.

A little about me: I love reading (always down for book recs or a mini book club), long walks when the weather cooperates, photography/photo walks, thrifting and bar hopping (not often but I’m usually down for a drink). I work from home so if any other wfh folks want to meet up and work at a coffee shop together that would also be cool. I’m  pretty laid-back and enjoy good conversation.

1r6ify0,https://i.redd.it/winkp9wzlwjg1.jpeg,I fixed Sable’s and Mikaela’s lore a bit,"**Highlighted text** is what got changed.  Not much changed by the way. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Sable’s lore:

**Growing up in Greenville, Sable figured she had to be adopted. No way was she the progeny of her insanely perky mom and her grinning, golf-playing, frat boy of a dad. They didn’t understand the first thing about her. She wasn’t into ponies or dolls or tea parties with teddy bears. She liked bugs, lizards, riding bikes, dirt clod fights and witchcraft. Her favorite holiday was Halloween and no one besides her parents, didn’t think she was crazy when she dyed her hair purple in eighth grade. Sable’s mom was furious. Her dad didn’t even notice. She when to the mall with her childhood best friend, Mikaela, when she got her ears pierced and helped her pick out her first tattoo.** An occult symbol hidden in a place her parents would never see. Mikaela declined to get her own tattoo. She flirted with the dark side, but she didn’t live it. Not like Sable. The dark side made sense to Sable, and she revelled in it. Partly because it freaked out her parents and teachers. Partly because it felt like who she was. Some called her a goth because of the way she presented herself. But she wasn’t into labels. She loved horror movies and found the occult exciting. It made sense to her. She knew that the shiny suburban world of her mom and dad had a dark underbelly. They were afraid to confront their fear, so they pretended everything was perfect and that they would live forever. But Sable knew better. Death stalked us all and no one was getting out alive.

**Mikaela got Sable a job at Moonstone.** She took classes at the local college and produced a guerrilla radio show on the shortwave in her attic. All Things Wicked This Night was about the world’s dark underbelly. The occult. Urban legends. Horror. And often there were heated discussions with Mikaela about the horror movies they’d catch at the only theatre in Greenville. Mikaela liked her horror with a little comedy, but Sable liked it meaner. Scarier. Bloodier. She relished the gore. Enjoyed the terror. Liked to feel the adrenaline rush. And their debates were entertaining to say the least.

When searching for inspiration for her show, Sable would take walks in the cemetery with all the statues and headstones of early settlers who had founded the town as a sanctuary for those escaping persecution. She often talked about that history on her show, and she formed a theory that the uncanny sightings and disappearances were somehow linked to the town’s history. One caller suggested the town was built on top of a fracture. The caller went on to describe a fracture as an overlap between worlds. Another caller said these fractures were created by an ancient cult devoted to forgotten demons. Another caller defined fractures as a cosmic buffet for an elder god that fed on pain, fear, and misery. And one caller even argued that it wasn’t a fracture but The Unknown, a mysterious creature that consumed anyone who dared to imagine it. All the theories made for fun and inspiring debates, and she loved nothing more than to discuss real-life horror until the horror became personal.

One evening Sable had challenged Mikaela to tell a real horror story at Moonstone’s Annual Halloween Festival. Scare the crap out of people. Stop dancing around the horror and embrace it. Tell a story about The Unknown. Make them imagine it. Make them believe The Unknown will show up on stage. Nothing terrifies an audience more than a show that could potentially kill them. Mikaela laughed at the idea and declined the challenge because she was working on another story with her roommate.

But a strange, black fog had taken Mikaela during her performance and Sable felt the icy hand of guilt grab her by the back of the neck. She was convinced that she had somehow sent Mikaela to her doom. Did The Unknown take her? Did she try to define The Unknown? What about her roommate? Her roommate disappeared as well. But then she realised Mikaela’s story wasn’t about The Unknown. It was about something else. Another dimension. A dimension filled with terrifying creatures, sadistic killers, and endless horror.

This was not The Unknown.

With this realisation, Sable began to investigate other disappearances in Greenville. Before long, she realised most of the disappearances occurred at the theatre or somewhere close by. Investigating further, she discovered the theatre was built over the ruins of an old, one-room schoolhouse that had burned to the ground in the 1920s. Somehow the students couldn’t get out and everyone perished in the flames. Feeling close to an answer, she continued her research and discovered two teenage brothers had recently disappeared from the theatre. Elias and Elan. The only witness, their younger sister, Ellen, was committed to an institution after ripping her eyes out. And so, pretending to be a relative, Sable went to talk to Ellen who admitted she and her brothers had been trying to steal old movie posters from the storage room behind the movie screen. She then described a secret door in the basement and a passageway that led to another place.

A dark place.

A cold place.

An evil place.

Stay away from there, she begged. Stay away.

But Sable wasn’t about to stay away.

Not after that story.

Determined to see Mikaela again, Sable hitched a ride to the theatre and soon found the door behind the movie screen. In the darkness she jimmied the door open with a crowbar and headed down a creaking, wooden stairway to the dank cellar. A light switch activated flickering fluorescent lights that illuminated a room filled with broken theatre seats and old movie posters dating back eighty years. She searched the sprawling basement and found a thick wooden door hidden behind a poster of the original Frankenstein. She pushed and shoved the door open to reveal an endless circular stairway descending into perfect darkness. Using a penlight to navigate, she descended for ten minutes before she noticed the cold, black fog rising from the lower depths.

The same cold, black fog that had taken Mikaela.

Sable considered running back up the stairs to where she would be safe. But then she thought about the terrifying creatures and the sadistic killers and the endless horror, and she quickly decided she wasn’t going to let her best friend have all the fun.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Mikaela’s lore: 

Mikaela Reid was sixteen when her father passed away. She would always miss his sailing lessons at dawn, his colourful yet inedible tacos, and his warm, contagious laughter. She felt like she was paddling in a vast, storm-black ocean, each rolling wave submerging her. Drifting in painful darkness, she almost lost herself, but resiliently, with love and care, she made her way back to shore.

Well-surrounded and supported by her friends, **especially by her childhood best friend, Sable,** Mikaela put the past behind her and looked at life in a new light. She was excited to try new things and discovered storytelling as an outlet. Her friends liked her stories of daunting danger and hard-earned survival. She read horror stories more and more, savouring the powerful, heart-pounding escapism it provided. Autumn become her favourite season and she threw a grand production for Halloween every year, hosting all her friends for a thrilling night of horror stories, scary games, and homemade treats.

Over the years, she also showed interest in witchcraft and practiced light blessings, plant-based spells, and palm-reading divination. She gardened sage, mugwort, and lavender to craft homemade products such as body butters, soaps and skin lotions. She aspired one day to live off the products she made for friends and family.

In the meantime, she worked as a barista at the Moonstone, an independent and eccentric coffee shop in the artsy part of town, Every Friday night, she hosted an open mic at the coffee shop, performing stories live in front of customers. Julian, her best friend and roommate, recorded some of her shows and posted them online. Also, unbeknown to her, he submitted one of her performances to the Endless Halloween Festival where renown storytellers performed on stage for Halloween.

It was a beautiful surprise when Mikaela received an email from the festival inviting her to perform at their grand final on Halloween. The winning prize was big enough for her to launch her line of products. Excited, she burnt a stick of herbs in each room to dissipate negative energies, then began to craft her tale of horror.

Mikaela stayed up all night filling her notebooks with abandoned beginnings. She had a story in mind, but unearthing it took patience and skill. The following night, the nightmares began. For a week, she would wake in the middle of the night gasping for air. Her dream was the same every night. She was dragged down a cold set of stairs and thrown into a dark basement. Then her lungs would be set ablaze by a sharp iron hook stabbing her in the chest. A dark figure would pull on the hook and hoist her from the ground, slowly, until the pain waked her. The more she finessed her Halloween tale, the darker her nightmares grew.

As days passed, exhaustion, anxiety, and stress took a toll on her. Often distracted, her coffees at the Moonstone were rushed, acrid, or going to the wrong customer. She no longer blessed the coffee beans in the morning nor looked for omens in the leftover coffee grains. Her energy was low, and her magic felt drained.

When she woke up screaming one night, she had had enough. She asked Julian to watch her while she slept and record anything unusual. Julian agreed and started recording while Mikaela lay on her bed.

Minutes later, her fingers began to twitch, then her toes. Her breath became laboured. Then Julian stared in shock as Mikaela slowly rose in the air, levitating over her bed. Panicked, he shook her shoulders to wake her, but stopped when she began to scream. He grabbed his phone to call an ambulance, but a powerful crash diverted his attention. He looked down the hallway and saw a large, spidery fang slam through the bathroom door.

Amidst the commotion, Mikaela woke. She saw the black spidery fang shredding the bathroom door and jumped out of bed. She slammed her bedroom door shut and shouted at Julian to help her barricade the door. Before he could react, however, the power went out. The room was submerged in sudden darkness.

A second later, the lights came back on and an eerie quietness followed. Mikaela and Julian ventured out the bedroom carefully. The bathroom door looked intact and there was no sign of anything abnormal. But Julian has recorded every sound.

A sleepless night followed. When she returned to the apartment after her shift, Julian was not there. Mikaela wanted to remove the recording of their ordeal, which he had posted online. Suspecting Julian might be at school, she left. The door clicked shut behind her, masking a stifled cry from the bathroom.

As she neared her car, she looked over her shoulder. Mikaela felt... watched. She whispered a protective spell and clutched her keys. Suddenly, a shadow pounced on the wall and she broke into a run. She reached her car and rushed inside, locking the doors. Breathing hard, she looked through the windows. No one was there. Perhaps it was her nerves playing tricks on her. She turned on the ignition and drove off.

The next day, Julian was still nowhere to be found. Mikaela had contacted everyone they knew. She looked for him all day and waited for him all night. Distraught and anxious, she missed her shift at the Moonstone. Halloween was tonight and so was the festival. Julian had entered the storytelling competition for her. He had supported her every time she doubted herself. Maybe he would be there. But between her nightmares and Julian's disappearance, she had been too worried to prepare a story for the contest. She looked at her notebook, filled with false starts. She could stay home, scared and helpless. Or she could finish what Julian had started. There was a reason why she loved to tell horror stories. They made her feel brave enough to face any challenge.

That evening when the host called Mikaela's name at the Endless Halloween Festival, she boldly stepped on stage, dressed in a costume: a black dress matched with a wide, witchy hat. She hoped to spot Julian in the crowd. But she could not find him and looking directly at the audience was a mistake. A sea of expectant faces was before her, eyes watching her every move. Her heart pounded in her chest as her hands began to shake.

She grabbed the warm microphone and cleared her throat. A thick silence greeted her, only interrupted by a distant cough. She reminded herself that tonight was All Hallows' Eve, when the veil thinned betwixt this realm and the one beyond. She had a story in her heart, a story that mattered. If she told it right, perhaps Julian would hear it.

Mikaela took a deep breath. The wet wind of Autumn whirled golden leaves around her. She inhaled the acrid smell of damp, foliage. She swallowed the bitter aftertaste of coffee still on her tongue. Distant eyes cawed from an old oak tree. She closed her eyes. The crimson darkness under her eyelids turned darker. Her heartbeat slowed. She exhaled deeply, her breath a puff of mist in the cold night air. Now she felt awakened, refreshed for the first time in weeks, and ready to tell the tale of a lifetime.

She spoke into the microphone in a deep, haunting voice. She narrated a tale of billowing winds on a cold Autumn night. Of a loyal friend disappearing before daylight. Of forgotten victims hiding in the wings of darkness. Of throbbing graves, sealed with terrible secrets. And of eternal night in the shadow of death.

Mikaela pointed at the night sky and said that no darkness was truly beyond light. Even on this moonless night, the sky shined with long-dead stars.

A thick black fog engulfed Mikaela, to the audience's amazement.

1r6ienz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BookPromotion/comments/1r6ienz/backrooms_2/,Backrooms 2,"Hey, I finally got around to writing a sequel to my first Backrooms book, and I wanted to share the first chapter here. It’s not fully polished yet, but what do you think?:

Chapter 0: Lars \~ The Bill

Lars dropped, exhausted, into the old armchair in front of his TV. Friday night. Finally this week was over. He did like his job as an analyst, but that did not make it any less tiring. His head was throbbing, and he did not want to think about anything anymore. Just switch off.

He picked up the remote, pressed the power button, and, almost absentmindedly, flipped through the channels. A dating show was on, trying hard to pass itself off as reality TV. The next channel was airing some kind of shopping program where a guy was demonstrating how well an iron worked, and Lars found himself wondering how things like that still existed. Who watched ads voluntarily and was then actually willing to call a hotline to order electronics?

He switched again.

A local news station.

The steady drone of the broadcast filled the room while the anchor’s tense voice only half reached him.

“Another missing persons case. A neighbor heard unusual noises during the night and alerted the police. When officers arrived on scene, they found an abandoned house. There was a large amount of blood on the stairs, suggesting the injured person is most likely no longer alive. As in previous cases, however, no body and no indications of the person’s whereabouts have been found.”

Lars straightened a little.

The screen showed a house from above, presumably filmed by a drone. He knew that neighborhood. It was one of the quietest parts of the city. Some time ago he had even considered moving there from his apartment downtown.

Then the image changed. Now the footage was from inside the house. A large pool of blood lay on the staircase leading upstairs, with spatters scattered across the walls. At the bottom of the stairs, a smear of blood trailed off to the side, as if something had been dragged along the floor. Lars leaned in. On the banister, there was a handprint, as if someone had tried to hold on.

He shuddered at the thought of what that person’s last moments must have looked like. Yellow tape blocked off the stairs, and police were trying to drive the reporters back.

He turned the TV off and rubbed his face, worn out. Another missing person. And it had always been a quiet city, the kind where nothing ever happened. A few months ago someone had disappeared for the first time, a child, and he had even joined a volunteer search, but they had found nothing. That had only been the first case. A few weeks later a young man vanished. His grandmother said he had been in the kitchen and she had gone into the living room. When she came back, he was gone. That was the last time anyone saw him. Another search followed.

With the child you could still assume an abduction. With the young man, questions remained. He would have had to leave voluntarily, without warning, even though he had planned to stay the night at his grandmother’s place because she needed help with renovations. At least, that was the story. And by now there had been many more disappearances.

The missing people had nothing in common. Not gender, not age, not profession. Nothing suggested a pattern. But one thing did unite them. There were no clues at all about what had happened, which made it feel all the more eerie. The police found nothing, and it was hard to shake the sense that they were hiding something. Lars could not think of another explanation, and yet that one sounded absurd. Still, it was clear the situation had thrown their little town into chaos. Especially now that they sometimes found the missing people’s blood, but never their bodies.

At work, people traded the wildest stories, but most of it was nothing but rumor. People wanted explanations, and when there were none, they made their own. Fear spread, careful and understated, but Lars noticed how tense everyone seemed.

He checked the time. Almost nine. His girlfriend would be here soon. The apartment was tidy, but did he have enough food? He wandered to the fridge. At the sight of it, a phrase popped into his head that he had heard somewhere once, and it made him snort despite himself: “The mouse hanged itself in the fridge.” A few eggs, an open can of preserved fruit, and leftovers of spaghetti bolognese from the night before. That was it. For him alone, no problem. For two, not even close.

He went into the hallway, glanced at the mirror, and pulled a face. His dark blond hair looked messy, and the shadows under his eyes stood out. Some sleep would do him good. He grabbed his leather jacket and headed out.

Outside, the air was cool and quiet. He breathed in the evening and set off. At the edge of the park, teenagers sat drinking beer. They laughed loudly, talking about someone they knew who had gotten stuck in an elevator. He did not mean to listen, but their drunken voices and bursts of laughter pushed their way into his thoughts. Farther along, someone sat with a paper cup, asking for money.

Lars always found himself wondering how someone ended up like that. Pity stirred, but he looked away, knowing he would forget the man in a few minutes. Ahead, the sign of the small grocery store glowed neon blue. Only a handful of cars were scattered across the parking lot. A couple of older people chatted near the entrance. He walked past them and went straight to the dairy aisle.

He grabbed milk for the coffee his girlfriend liked so much. In general he tried to pick up things she would enjoy. He was the one who had ruined everything, and now their relationship was on the edge of breaking. She had given him one more chance, but nothing felt the way it used to. He sensed her tension, her mistrust, and he had earned it.

At the company party he had drunk far too much and woken up the next day in his coworker’s bed, even though it was not like him at all. From there on, everything went downhill.

His girlfriend found out in the ugliest way. One of his colleagues had taken photos of him making out with that coworker and posted them online. When Lars drove home the next morning, her bags were already packed and she was about to leave.

Just thinking about it made his skin crawl. He had managed to convince her to give him a second chance, and now he was trying to do everything right, hoping she would forget sooner or later.

The walk home was just as dull. He still wanted to cook something decent tonight, so he turned into a side alley to take a shortcut. At the far end of the street, someone else came around the corner at the same time. A dark figure, slightly hunched. Lars could not make out the face because the hood of the sweatshirt covered it halfway.

Something about the person felt off. Lars could not have said what it was, but his body tightened anyway. Without making it obvious, he crossed to the other side of the street. With everything that had been happening lately, a little caution seemed smart.

They drew closer, and the air felt thicker. Lars watched from the corner of his eye. It seemed to vibrate with tension.

No.

Lars stopped short. It was not tension. The air was vibrating, literally. He had no other way to describe it. The man on the other side stopped too, pulled the hood back, and looked around, confused. He actually had the face of a nice guy.

Their eyes met, questioning, but neither of them said a word.

A sudden noise made Lars clap his hands over his ears. One of those high, shrill tones that hurt instantly and, for a second, stole your sense of direction.

Then it happened.

A dark creature burst out of the wall of the nearest building. Not through a window or a door. Out of the smooth wall itself. A heavy, rotten stench filled the air at once. It sank sharp teeth into the poor man’s shoulder and dragged him back into the wall. His scream was cut off as if someone had swallowed it.

Lars stood frozen, his fingers clamped around the shopping bag he held against his chest, staring at the blood left on the asphalt.

Was he losing his mind?

The smear of blood leading straight to the wall told him no.

He had to get home. Now. Should he call the police? His legs moved on their own. He did not truly come back to himself until his apartment door slammed shut behind him.

He sat at the kitchen table. His eyes flicked to his hands. They were shaking uncontrollably.

Was that what had been behind all the disappearances? Were they all being taken by that thing?

He pinched his forearm a few times. If it could come out of a wall, and if the missing cases were connected, did that mean it could get in anywhere?

A light pressure touched his shoulder and he jerked upright.

Sophia. He had not even noticed her coming in.

Worry spread across her face as she stepped closer. “Everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Lars swallowed. Could he tell her? Would she believe him? The words stuck, refusing to leave his mouth.

Sophia frowned and took hold of his arms. “What happened?”

“I…” He drew a deep breath and forced himself to say it. “I just saw someone get killed.”

“Were you hurt?” She patted him down on instinct, but he shook his head and she stopped. “We need to call the police,” she said, decisive, already fishing her phone out of her pocket.

“No.” The word came out too sharp. He took the phone from her hand. “You don’t understand. We can’t call the police. This is different.”

“What do you mean?” Her baby blue eyes stared at him, bewildered.

He did not know how to choose the words. But this was Sophia. She had been there for him for years. He did not want to lie to her.

“It was a monster,” he said. “It looked horrible. It grabbed the man and dragged him into the wall.”

Lars watched her lips form a small O. Then she pressed a hand to his forehead, probably checking for a fever. When she spoke again, her voice had gone careful.

“Please be honest with me. Did you… did you maybe take something?”

Irritation flared. He took a few steps away. “No. I’m serious.”

“Lars…” She inhaled slowly. “Do you hear how that sounds?” She looked completely overwhelmed.

“I’m not crazy. And yes, I know how it sounds. But I know what I saw. Please believe me.”

“Okay,” she said softly. “We’re going to sit down. I’ll make you some chamomile tea, and when you’ve calmed down, you’ll tell me exactly what happened. Your eyes could have played a trick on you, maybe. There has to be a reasonable explanation.”

He sighed, but sat. She hurried to the kettle. He stared at his hands. They were still shaking, and paranoia crept up his spine. He did not feel safe here. Would it be better to go to his parents and stay there for a while? He would just have to convince Sophia to come with him. He would not leave her here alone.

The clink of a cup on the table pulled him out of his thoughts.

“I saw what I saw,” he said, voice tight. “He was only a few steps away. That thing grabbed him and dragged him off. All that was left was blood. Don’t you get it? The missing cases over the last few months. They must all be connected. That’s why they never find bodies.”

“Calm down,” Sophia said gently. She was about to add something, but her phone rang.

A name lit up on the screen. Jenny.

Sophia hit decline and turned back to him, but before she could speak, the phone rang again.

“Answer it,” Lars said. His voice was hoarse, bitter because she still did not believe him. “It looks important.”

Her lips pressed together, but she picked up.

“Hey… it’s just that something…” The voice on the other end cut her off. Lars could not make out the words.

“No? What do you mean?”

Sophia shot to her feet and went to the window, pulling the curtains aside. “Are you sure?” The question came out tight.

“Okay. See you later.”

She hung up and turned to Lars.

Her face had gone pale.

“What happened?” he asked, already at her side.

My sister is a 24 almost 25 year old single mom of a 4 year old boy. I read in the rules we have to put how long we have all known each other. Obviously I have known my sister since she was born and I have known my mom since I was born lol. 

She and her son live with my mom full time in the house that we all grew up in. I live 5 minutes away. My mom watches my nephew 6-7 days a week while my sister works part time at a coffee shop and the other days she is at hair school. She has just been promoted to shift lead so her hours have been longer. My mom is 65 with spinal stenosis which is very painful. My nephew is a sweetheart but also a handful. He's very very active. 

My sister does not care that my mom is burnt out watching a young child so many hours at her age. If my mom asks her to change her hours, she is met with anger from my sister or my sister will say she will do it and then never follows through. 

If my sister is dating a guy, she will spend even more time away from her son. This really bothers my mom because she grew up with an absent mother and can't stand seeing my nephew constantly wanting his mom. My sister becomes obsessive about the men (her current bf is just 20), she is dating and needs to be around them all the time. She will feel bad eventually and see her son and spend some time with him, but a lot of the time it's with her on her phone talking to her two best friends (who are both 18) and her bf. 

My mom does everything for my nephew. My sister does not buy him food, clothing or do his or her laundry. She claims she is too busy. She is also very obsessive over her looks and needs 2+ hours to get ready and take selfies. 

My mom has expressed to my sister that she does not want her bringing her underage friends over and drinking with them. My sister does not care and does this anyway. My mom has told my sister she is not ok with her bringing her 20 year old bf over to spend the night since it's not fair to her son. My sister will say, tough luck, I'm gonna bring him anyway. I'm an adult and you can't tell me what to do. 

My mom has told my sister multiple times she feels disregarded and my sister just tells her she is being negative. I told my mom she needs to set some hard boundaries with my sister and tell her if she doesn't abide by them she can find somewhere else to live. I don't understand why my sister doesn't appear to care about our mom and what burn out could do at the age of 65. My mom is relatively healthy but recently had a scare with atrial fibrillation and has been having panic attacks because she wants to confront my sister about these boundaries but is scared my sister will not speak to her again. 

Any advice? I feel so awful for my mom. ",3,1771268141.0,relationship_advice,11,1.0,False

Taking Doxy,"I got this from using the wrong soap. Apparently using too many feminine hygiene products make you far more susceptible to getting a uti. I’m on Doxycycline 100mg, 7 days (2 pills daily). I’m avoiding sugar (besides my morning coffee just cream no sugar). It’s day 4, and I’m still experiencing burning. It’s not as bad as before, but yes there is still some burning when I pee. I have never had to get on back to back antibiotics but I truly hope it’s out of my system by day 7. I only have three more days of meds and I’m worried. How long did it take on average for your symptoms to get better like the burning to stop? My last uti was about 4 months ago. That was due to intercourse, which made me go fully celibate. When I finish my antibiotics I’m going straight to trying out azo cranberry and prelief for acidity. I just don’t know if this is normal and hope it’ll be gone by the time I finish these meds :( the fatigue sucks also from taking this, but then again that feeling could also be from my hypothyroidism.",1,1771268118.0,CUTI,0,1.0,False

Chapter 0: Lars \~ The Bill

Lars dropped, exhausted, into the old armchair in front of his TV. Friday night. Finally this week was over. He did like his job as an analyst, but that did not make it any less tiring. His head was throbbing, and he did not want to think about anything anymore. Just switch off.

He picked up the remote, pressed the power button, and, almost absentmindedly, flipped through the channels. A dating show was on, trying hard to pass itself off as reality TV. The next channel was airing some kind of shopping program where a guy was demonstrating how well an iron worked, and Lars found himself wondering how things like that still existed. Who watched ads voluntarily and was then actually willing to call a hotline to order electronics?

He switched again.

A local news station.

The steady drone of the broadcast filled the room while the anchor’s tense voice only half reached him.

“Another missing persons case. A neighbor heard unusual noises during the night and alerted the police. When officers arrived on scene, they found an abandoned house. There was a large amount of blood on the stairs, suggesting the injured person is most likely no longer alive. As in previous cases, however, no body and no indications of the person’s whereabouts have been found.”

Lars straightened a little.

The screen showed a house from above, presumably filmed by a drone. He knew that neighborhood. It was one of the quietest parts of the city. Some time ago he had even considered moving there from his apartment downtown.

Then the image changed. Now the footage was from inside the house. A large pool of blood lay on the staircase leading upstairs, with spatters scattered across the walls. At the bottom of the stairs, a smear of blood trailed off to the side, as if something had been dragged along the floor. Lars leaned in. On the banister, there was a handprint, as if someone had tried to hold on.

He shuddered at the thought of what that person’s last moments must have looked like. Yellow tape blocked off the stairs, and police were trying to drive the reporters back.

He turned the TV off and rubbed his face, worn out. Another missing person. And it had always been a quiet city, the kind where nothing ever happened. A few months ago someone had disappeared for the first time, a child, and he had even joined a volunteer search, but they had found nothing. That had only been the first case. A few weeks later a young man vanished. His grandmother said he had been in the kitchen and she had gone into the living room. When she came back, he was gone. That was the last time anyone saw him. Another search followed.

With the child you could still assume an abduction. With the young man, questions remained. He would have had to leave voluntarily, without warning, even though he had planned to stay the night at his grandmother’s place because she needed help with renovations. At least, that was the story. And by now there had been many more disappearances.

The missing people had nothing in common. Not gender, not age, not profession. Nothing suggested a pattern. But one thing did unite them. There were no clues at all about what had happened, which made it feel all the more eerie. The police found nothing, and it was hard to shake the sense that they were hiding something. Lars could not think of another explanation, and yet that one sounded absurd. Still, it was clear the situation had thrown their little town into chaos. Especially now that they sometimes found the missing people’s blood, but never their bodies.

At work, people traded the wildest stories, but most of it was nothing but rumor. People wanted explanations, and when there were none, they made their own. Fear spread, careful and understated, but Lars noticed how tense everyone seemed.

He checked the time. Almost nine. His girlfriend would be here soon. The apartment was tidy, but did he have enough food? He wandered to the fridge. At the sight of it, a phrase popped into his head that he had heard somewhere once, and it made him snort despite himself: “The mouse hanged itself in the fridge.” A few eggs, an open can of preserved fruit, and leftovers of spaghetti bolognese from the night before. That was it. For him alone, no problem. For two, not even close.

He went into the hallway, glanced at the mirror, and pulled a face. His dark blond hair looked messy, and the shadows under his eyes stood out. Some sleep would do him good. He grabbed his leather jacket and headed out.

Outside, the air was cool and quiet. He breathed in the evening and set off. At the edge of the park, teenagers sat drinking beer. They laughed loudly, talking about someone they knew who had gotten stuck in an elevator. He did not mean to listen, but their drunken voices and bursts of laughter pushed their way into his thoughts. Farther along, someone sat with a paper cup, asking for money.

Lars always found himself wondering how someone ended up like that. Pity stirred, but he looked away, knowing he would forget the man in a few minutes. Ahead, the sign of the small grocery store glowed neon blue. Only a handful of cars were scattered across the parking lot. A couple of older people chatted near the entrance. He walked past them and went straight to the dairy aisle.

He grabbed milk for the coffee his girlfriend liked so much. In general he tried to pick up things she would enjoy. He was the one who had ruined everything, and now their relationship was on the edge of breaking. She had given him one more chance, but nothing felt the way it used to. He sensed her tension, her mistrust, and he had earned it.

At the company party he had drunk far too much and woken up the next day in his coworker’s bed, even though it was not like him at all. From there on, everything went downhill.

His girlfriend found out in the ugliest way. One of his colleagues had taken photos of him making out with that coworker and posted them online. When Lars drove home the next morning, her bags were already packed and she was about to leave.

Just thinking about it made his skin crawl. He had managed to convince her to give him a second chance, and now he was trying to do everything right, hoping she would forget sooner or later.

The walk home was just as dull. He still wanted to cook something decent tonight, so he turned into a side alley to take a shortcut. At the far end of the street, someone else came around the corner at the same time. A dark figure, slightly hunched. Lars could not make out the face because the hood of the sweatshirt covered it halfway.

Something about the person felt off. Lars could not have said what it was, but his body tightened anyway. Without making it obvious, he crossed to the other side of the street. With everything that had been happening lately, a little caution seemed smart.

They drew closer, and the air felt thicker. Lars watched from the corner of his eye. It seemed to vibrate with tension.

No.

Lars stopped short. It was not tension. The air was vibrating, literally. He had no other way to describe it. The man on the other side stopped too, pulled the hood back, and looked around, confused. He actually had the face of a nice guy.

Their eyes met, questioning, but neither of them said a word.

A sudden noise made Lars clap his hands over his ears. One of those high, shrill tones that hurt instantly and, for a second, stole your sense of direction.

Then it happened.

A dark creature burst out of the wall of the nearest building. Not through a window or a door. Out of the smooth wall itself. A heavy, rotten stench filled the air at once. It sank sharp teeth into the poor man’s shoulder and dragged him back into the wall. His scream was cut off as if someone had swallowed it.

Lars stood frozen, his fingers clamped around the shopping bag he held against his chest, staring at the blood left on the asphalt.

Was he losing his mind?

The smear of blood leading straight to the wall told him no.

He had to get home. Now. Should he call the police? His legs moved on their own. He did not truly come back to himself until his apartment door slammed shut behind him.

He sat at the kitchen table. His eyes flicked to his hands. They were shaking uncontrollably.

Was that what had been behind all the disappearances? Were they all being taken by that thing?

He pinched his forearm a few times. If it could come out of a wall, and if the missing cases were connected, did that mean it could get in anywhere?

A light pressure touched his shoulder and he jerked upright.

Sophia. He had not even noticed her coming in.

Worry spread across her face as she stepped closer. “Everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Lars swallowed. Could he tell her? Would she believe him? The words stuck, refusing to leave his mouth.

Sophia frowned and took hold of his arms. “What happened?”

“I…” He drew a deep breath and forced himself to say it. “I just saw someone get killed.”

“Were you hurt?” She patted him down on instinct, but he shook his head and she stopped. “We need to call the police,” she said, decisive, already fishing her phone out of her pocket.

“No.” The word came out too sharp. He took the phone from her hand. “You don’t understand. We can’t call the police. This is different.”

“What do you mean?” Her baby blue eyes stared at him, bewildered.

He did not know how to choose the words. But this was Sophia. She had been there for him for years. He did not want to lie to her.

“It was a monster,” he said. “It looked horrible. It grabbed the man and dragged him into the wall.”

Lars watched her lips form a small O. Then she pressed a hand to his forehead, probably checking for a fever. When she spoke again, her voice had gone careful.

“Please be honest with me. Did you… did you maybe take something?”

Irritation flared. He took a few steps away. “No. I’m serious.”

“Lars…” She inhaled slowly. “Do you hear how that sounds?” She looked completely overwhelmed.

“I’m not crazy. And yes, I know how it sounds. But I know what I saw. Please believe me.”

“Okay,” she said softly. “We’re going to sit down. I’ll make you some chamomile tea, and when you’ve calmed down, you’ll tell me exactly what happened. Your eyes could have played a trick on you, maybe. There has to be a reasonable explanation.”

He sighed, but sat. She hurried to the kettle. He stared at his hands. They were still shaking, and paranoia crept up his spine. He did not feel safe here. Would it be better to go to his parents and stay there for a while? He would just have to convince Sophia to come with him. He would not leave her here alone.

The clink of a cup on the table pulled him out of his thoughts.

“I saw what I saw,” he said, voice tight. “He was only a few steps away. That thing grabbed him and dragged him off. All that was left was blood. Don’t you get it? The missing cases over the last few months. They must all be connected. That’s why they never find bodies.”

“Calm down,” Sophia said gently. She was about to add something, but her phone rang.

A name lit up on the screen. Jenny.

Sophia hit decline and turned back to him, but before she could speak, the phone rang again.

“Answer it,” Lars said. His voice was hoarse, bitter because she still did not believe him. “It looks important.”

Her lips pressed together, but she picked up.

“Hey… it’s just that something…” The voice on the other end cut her off. Lars could not make out the words.

“No? What do you mean?”

Sophia shot to her feet and went to the window, pulling the curtains aside. “Are you sure?” The question came out tight.

“Okay. See you later.”

She hung up and turned to Lars.

Her face had gone pale.

“What happened?” he asked, already at her side.

Because that’s not small. It looks small from the outside. But when you’re in that fog? When your brain turns a sink full of dishes into proof that you’re failing at adulthood? That’s not just “doing the dishes.” That’s fighting your own head.
And I know that exact move. The trash-can-press. The strategic coffee mug rearranging so it feels less bad without actually fixing it. The not turning the light on because if you don’t fully see it, maybe it’s not real. Been there. It’s weirdly heavy.
The part that matters isn’t that you cleaned it.
It’s that you didn’t spiral first.
You didn’t go straight to I’m disgusting, I’m lazy, other adults don’t struggle like this. You just filled the sink with hot water. That’s such a quiet, powerful move. You lowered the bar to “one plate.” And then another. And then suddenly you were in it.
That’s momentum. That’s you interrupting the pattern.
Also — music on, windows cracked open even though it’s freezing? That detail got me. That’s you letting some air in, literally and mentally. That’s not just cleaning. That’s reclaiming the space.
And the brain saying “this doesn’t count because normal people don’t let it get this bad” — that voice is such a liar. Normal people absolutely let it get that bad. Especially when they’re tired. Or low. Or just human.
You let it get messy. And then you fixed it.
That’s resilience. Messy resilience, but still.
Standing there looking at the empty sink like it was a trophy? It was a trophy. You did not shove it onto future-you. You did not quit halfway. You didn’t numb out.
You won today. Not in a dramatic, movie-montage way. In a real, 31-years-old-in-a-tiny-Columbus-apartment way.
So yeah.
Tie-your-shoes energy. First-bike-ride energy. You beat the fog for an hour and that counts more than you think.
And tonight when you walk into that clean kitchen? Let yourself feel it. Don’t minimize it. You earned that empty sink.

He picked up the remote, pressed the power button, and, almost absentmindedly, flipped through the channels. A dating show was on, trying hard to pass itself off as reality TV. The next channel was airing some kind of shopping program where a guy was demonstrating how well an iron worked, and Lars found himself wondering how things like that still existed. Who watched ads voluntarily and was then actually willing to call a hotline to order electronics?

He switched again.

A local news station.

The steady drone of the broadcast filled the room while the anchor’s tense voice only half reached him.

“Another missing persons case. A neighbor heard unusual noises during the night and alerted the police. When officers arrived on scene, they found an abandoned house. There was a large amount of blood on the stairs, suggesting the injured person is most likely no longer alive. As in previous cases, however, no body and no indications of the person’s whereabouts have been found.”

Lars straightened a little.

The screen showed a house from above, presumably filmed by a drone. He knew that neighborhood. It was one of the quietest parts of the city. Some time ago he had even considered moving there from his apartment downtown.

Then the image changed. Now the footage was from inside the house. A large pool of blood lay on the staircase leading upstairs, with spatters scattered across the walls. At the bottom of the stairs, a smear of blood trailed off to the side, as if something had been dragged along the floor. Lars leaned in. On the banister, there was a handprint, as if someone had tried to hold on.

He shuddered at the thought of what that person’s last moments must have looked like. Yellow tape blocked off the stairs, and police were trying to drive the reporters back.

He turned the TV off and rubbed his face, worn out. Another missing person. And it had always been a quiet city, the kind where nothing ever happened. A few months ago someone had disappeared for the first time, a child, and he had even joined a volunteer search, but they had found nothing. That had only been the first case. A few weeks later a young man vanished. His grandmother said he had been in the kitchen and she had gone into the living room. When she came back, he was gone. That was the last time anyone saw him. Another search followed.

With the child you could still assume an abduction. With the young man, questions remained. He would have had to leave voluntarily, without warning, even though he had planned to stay the night at his grandmother’s place because she needed help with renovations. At least, that was the story. And by now there had been many more disappearances.

The missing people had nothing in common. Not gender, not age, not profession. Nothing suggested a pattern. But one thing did unite them. There were no clues at all about what had happened, which made it feel all the more eerie. The police found nothing, and it was hard to shake the sense that they were hiding something. Lars could not think of another explanation, and yet that one sounded absurd. Still, it was clear the situation had thrown their little town into chaos. Especially now that they sometimes found the missing people’s blood, but never their bodies.

At work, people traded the wildest stories, but most of it was nothing but rumor. People wanted explanations, and when there were none, they made their own. Fear spread, careful and understated, but Lars noticed how tense everyone seemed.

He checked the time. Almost nine. His girlfriend would be here soon. The apartment was tidy, but did he have enough food? He wandered to the fridge. At the sight of it, a phrase popped into his head that he had heard somewhere once, and it made him snort despite himself: “The mouse hanged itself in the fridge.” A few eggs, an open can of preserved fruit, and leftovers of spaghetti bolognese from the night before. That was it. For him alone, no problem. For two, not even close.

He went into the hallway, glanced at the mirror, and pulled a face. His dark blond hair looked messy, and the shadows under his eyes stood out. Some sleep would do him good. He grabbed his leather jacket and headed out.

Outside, the air was cool and quiet. He breathed in the evening and set off. At the edge of the park, teenagers sat drinking beer. They laughed loudly, talking about someone they knew who had gotten stuck in an elevator. He did not mean to listen, but their drunken voices and bursts of laughter pushed their way into his thoughts. Farther along, someone sat with a paper cup, asking for money.

Lars always found himself wondering how someone ended up like that. Pity stirred, but he looked away, knowing he would forget the man in a few minutes. Ahead, the sign of the small grocery store glowed neon blue. Only a handful of cars were scattered across the parking lot. A couple of older people chatted near the entrance. He walked past them and went straight to the dairy aisle.

He grabbed milk for the coffee his girlfriend liked so much. In general he tried to pick up things she would enjoy. He was the one who had ruined everything, and now their relationship was on the edge of breaking. She had given him one more chance, but nothing felt the way it used to. He sensed her tension, her mistrust, and he had earned it.

At the company party he had drunk far too much and woken up the next day in his coworker’s bed, even though it was not like him at all. From there on, everything went downhill.

His girlfriend found out in the ugliest way. One of his colleagues had taken photos of him making out with that coworker and posted them online. When Lars drove home the next morning, her bags were already packed and she was about to leave.

Just thinking about it made his skin crawl. He had managed to convince her to give him a second chance, and now he was trying to do everything right, hoping she would forget sooner or later.

The walk home was just as dull. He still wanted to cook something decent tonight, so he turned into a side alley to take a shortcut. At the far end of the street, someone else came around the corner at the same time. A dark figure, slightly hunched. Lars could not make out the face because the hood of the sweatshirt covered it halfway.

Something about the person felt off. Lars could not have said what it was, but his body tightened anyway. Without making it obvious, he crossed to the other side of the street. With everything that had been happening lately, a little caution seemed smart.

They drew closer, and the air felt thicker. Lars watched from the corner of his eye. It seemed to vibrate with tension.

No.

Lars stopped short. It was not tension. The air was vibrating, literally. He had no other way to describe it. The man on the other side stopped too, pulled the hood back, and looked around, confused. He actually had the face of a nice guy.

Their eyes met, questioning, but neither of them said a word.

A sudden noise made Lars clap his hands over his ears. One of those high, shrill tones that hurt instantly and, for a second, stole your sense of direction.

Then it happened.

A dark creature burst out of the wall of the nearest building. Not through a window or a door. Out of the smooth wall itself. A heavy, rotten stench filled the air at once. It sank sharp teeth into the poor man’s shoulder and dragged him back into the wall. His scream was cut off as if someone had swallowed it.

Lars stood frozen, his fingers clamped around the shopping bag he held against his chest, staring at the blood left on the asphalt.

Was he losing his mind?

The smear of blood leading straight to the wall told him no.

He had to get home. Now. Should he call the police? His legs moved on their own. He did not truly come back to himself until his apartment door slammed shut behind him.

He sat at the kitchen table. His eyes flicked to his hands. They were shaking uncontrollably.

Was that what had been behind all the disappearances? Were they all being taken by that thing?

He pinched his forearm a few times. If it could come out of a wall, and if the missing cases were connected, did that mean it could get in anywhere?

A light pressure touched his shoulder and he jerked upright.

Sophia. He had not even noticed her coming in.

Worry spread across her face as she stepped closer. “Everything okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

Lars swallowed. Could he tell her? Would she believe him? The words stuck, refusing to leave his mouth.

Sophia frowned and took hold of his arms. “What happened?”

“I…” He drew a deep breath and forced himself to say it. “I just saw someone get killed.”

“Were you hurt?” She patted him down on instinct, but he shook his head and she stopped. “We need to call the police,” she said, decisive, already fishing her phone out of her pocket.

“No.” The word came out too sharp. He took the phone from her hand. “You don’t understand. We can’t call the police. This is different.”

“What do you mean?” Her baby blue eyes stared at him, bewildered.

He did not know how to choose the words. But this was Sophia. She had been there for him for years. He did not want to lie to her.

“It was a monster,” he said. “It looked horrible. It grabbed the man and dragged him into the wall.”

Lars watched her lips form a small O. Then she pressed a hand to his forehead, probably checking for a fever. When she spoke again, her voice had gone careful.

“Please be honest with me. Did you… did you maybe take something?”

Irritation flared. He took a few steps away. “No. I’m serious.”

“Lars…” She inhaled slowly. “Do you hear how that sounds?” She looked completely overwhelmed.

“I’m not crazy. And yes, I know how it sounds. But I know what I saw. Please believe me.”

“Okay,” she said softly. “We’re going to sit down. I’ll make you some chamomile tea, and when you’ve calmed down, you’ll tell me exactly what happened. Your eyes could have played a trick on you, maybe. There has to be a reasonable explanation.”

He sighed, but sat. She hurried to the kettle. He stared at his hands. They were still shaking, and paranoia crept up his spine. He did not feel safe here. Would it be better to go to his parents and stay there for a while? He would just have to convince Sophia to come with him. He would not leave her here alone.

The clink of a cup on the table pulled him out of his thoughts.

“I saw what I saw,” he said, voice tight. “He was only a few steps away. That thing grabbed him and dragged him off. All that was left was blood. Don’t you get it? The missing cases over the last few months. They must all be connected. That’s why they never find bodies.”

“Calm down,” Sophia said gently. She was about to add something, but her phone rang.

A name lit up on the screen. Jenny.

Sophia hit decline and turned back to him, but before she could speak, the phone rang again.

“Answer it,” Lars said. His voice was hoarse, bitter because she still did not believe him. “It looks important.”

Her lips pressed together, but she picked up.

“Hey… it’s just that something…” The voice on the other end cut her off. Lars could not make out the words.

“No? What do you mean?”

Sophia shot to her feet and went to the window, pulling the curtains aside. “Are you sure?” The question came out tight.

“Okay. See you later.”

She hung up and turned to Lars.

Her face had gone pale.

“What happened?” he asked, already at her side.

“They’re sealing off the city.”",1,1771267890.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

The first thing I noticed about being Level 2 was that everything felt sharper. The fuzzy edges of my spectral form had solidified into something more defined, like upgrading from 480p to 4K.

“You look different,” Miles said, glancing at me as we walked. “More, there.”

“I feel different. Like I’m more anchored to reality.” I experimentally reached out to touch a mailbox, and instead of phasing through it completely, I felt a slight resistance.

“And I can sense weird shit everywhere now.”

“Define weird shit.”

I paused, scanning the area with my Spectral Sense. “There’s something funky about that coffee shop on the corner. And that apartment building has some kind of protective ward around it. Oh, and there’s definitely a ghost hanging around the bus stop.”

Miles stopped walking. “Another ghost?”

“Yeah, looks like an old woman. She’s just, standing there. Waiting for a bus.” I squinted at the translucent figure. “Should I go talk to her?”

“Hell no,” Miles said quickly. “We don’t know the rules yet. What if she’s hostile? What if there’s ghost politics? What if you accidentally start a turf war?”

I was about to argue when a new notification popped up in my HUD.

[NEW QUEST AVAILABLE: WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD]

[OBJECTIVE: MAKE CONTACT WITH 3 OTHER SUPERNATURAL ENTITIES]

[REWARD: 30 XP]

[WARNING: NOT ALL ENTITIES ARE FRIENDLY]

The ghost at the bus stop must have sensed my attention because she turned in our direction. Even from a distance, I could see her mouth moving, but no sound reached us. She started walking toward us with the jerky, unnatural gait of something that had forgotten how living bodies moved.

“She’s coming over here,” I informed Miles, who immediately started walking faster.

“Nope. Nope, nope, nope. I’ve had enough supernatural bullshit for one night.”

As she got closer, I could make out more details. A floral dress from maybe the 1950s, a handbag clutched in her translucent hands.

“Young man,” she called out. “Young man, you’re new.”

I stopped, despite Miles’s frantic gesturing for me to keep moving. “Yeah, I’m new. Just died tonight, actually.”

The ghost woman smiled, and it wasn’t entirely pleasant. “Oh, how exciting.”

Miles was staring at me like I’d lost my mind, watching me have a conversation with empty air. “Lex, what the hell are you doing?”

“Talking to the bus stop ghost,” I replied. “Her name’s,” I looked at the woman expectantly.

“Ethel Mcintyre.” she supplied. “Died in 1962 waiting for the number 47 bus. Still waiting, actually. The route was discontinued in 1987.”

“That’s, really depressing.”

“Oh, it’s not so bad,” Ethel said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. “Late night commuters, teenagers on dates, the occasional drunk businessman. They all react so delightfully when I suddenly materialize next to them at 2 AM. Plus, I’ve developed quite the reputation among the local transit authority. They’ve rerouted three different bus lines because of ‘unexplained mechanical failures’ in my area.”

“Consistency is key in our line of work,” Ethel said, adjusting her spectral handbag. “Though I must say, the quality of scares has declined over the years. Everyone’s so distracted by those little glowing rectangles they carry around.”

“Smartphones,” I said. “Yeah, I can see how that would hurt business.”

“That’s nothing compared to what social media has done to our industry,” Ethel continued, her voice taking on a bitter edge. “Used to be, you could possess someone for a good haunting and they’d keep quiet about it. Too embarrassed, too afraid people would think they were crazy. Now? They livestream everything. Do you know how many ghost videos get posted every day? We’ve become entertainment.”

I floated closer to Ethel, intrigued despite myself. “So the whole ghost thing is basically ruined by the internet?”

“Not ruined, dear. Evolved. The smart ones adapt.” She gestured toward the empty street. “Take the Influencer Ghost downtown, specializes in photobombing tourist selfies.”

“I run a small consulting business for newly deceased spirits. Very reasonable rates.”

A ghost consultant. Of course. Death had apparently been monetized just like everything else.

“Thanks, but I think I’m figuring things out okay on my own,” I said.

Ethel’s smile turned predatory. “Oh, but you’re not fine, dear. You’re new with no mentor, no understanding of the Hierarchy, and you’re broadcasting your presence like a neon sign. The Collectors will notice you soon enough.”

“The what now?”

“Collectors. They harvest low level spirits for ectoplasm. Quite profitable, I’m told. Terribly unpleasant for the ghost, of course. There are rules, dear. Territories. Chain of command. The Wraith Queen doesn’t take kindly to rogues operating in her domain without proper registration.”

“There’s a Wraith Queen?”

“Portland’s supernatural community is surprisingly well organized,” Ethel explained. “The Queen maintains order among the undead, mediates disputes, and most importantly, protects us from the living who would exploit our essence.”

I felt a chill that had nothing to do with being dead. “And I’m supposed to, what, pay dues now?”

“The registration fee is quite reasonable.” Ethel’s smile was all teeth. “Of course, if you prefer to remain unregistered, well, that’s between you and the Collectors.”

Miles was now pacing in small circles, muttering to himself. “He’s been dead for like six hours and he’s already networking with other ghosts. This is fine. Everything is fine.”

Miles had stopped pacing and was now staring at me with genuine concern.

“What about the Collectors you mentioned?” I asked, ignoring Miles’s breakdown.

Ethel’s expression darkened. “Nasty business. Living humans who’ve figured out how to bottle ectoplasm. They use specialized equipment to trap and drain spirits. The essence gets sold to alchemists, necromancers, that sort of crowd.”

“And they target new ghosts?”

“Easier to catch.” She opened her handbag and pulled out what looked like a business card made of condensed fog. “Which is why you need proper representation.”

I reached for the card, surprised when my fingers actually made contact with it. The surface felt cold and slightly damp, like touching morning dew.

“Ethel McIntyre, Supernatural Consultant,” I read aloud. “Specializing in New Ghost Orientation, Territory Disputes, and Afterlife Insurance.”

“Afterlife insurance?”

“You’d be amazed how many spirits get permanently dispersed due to improper preparation,” Ethel said matter of factly. “One bad exorcism and poof, you’re gone forever. My premium package includes protection rituals and emergency evacuation services.”

“Calm down I’m networking, Building professional relationships in my new career field.”

Ethel checked an watch on her wrist. “Well, my bus should be rolling up any minute. I find it’s best to catch them when they’re just tired enough to think they imagined it, but not so tired they sleep through the entire encounter.”

A low mechanical groan echoed down the street. Headlights crept around the corner. The city bus, half-empty, pulled up to the curb with a hiss of air brakes and the kind of defeated wheeze only public transit can produce.

She straightened her blazer, smoothed her hair and stepped forward with the confidence of someone about to ruin someone’s night.

Inside the bus, I saw her materialize three seats from the front, right next to a college kid half-asleep with earbuds in. Ethel didn’t say a word. She just existed next to him.

The reaction was immediate. The kid flinched so hard he dropped his phone. A woman a few rows back screamed. The bus driver yelled something unintelligible and swerved slightly, forcing half the passengers to grip the seat rails like their lives depended on it.

[QUEST UPDATED: WELCOME TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD]

[OBJECTIVE: MAKE CONTACT WITH 3 OTHER SUPERNATURAL ENTITIES]

[PROGRESS: 1/3 COMPLETED]

[REWARD: 300 XP, SKILL UNLOCK]

[WARNING: NOT ALL ENTITIES ARE FRIENDLY]

“Can we please just go home?” Miles asked. “I’m hitting my weird shit quota for the day.”

“Yeah, let’s go.”

As we walked back to my house, I filled Miles in on my conversation with Ethel. By the time I finished explaining the Wraith Queen and the Collectors, he looked like he was ready to throw up.

“So you’re telling me there’s a whole supernatural mafia, and you’re an unregistered ghost who’s basically walking around with a target on his back?”

“That’s the gist of it, yeah.” I drifted through a stop sign.

Miles pulled out his vape, taking a long drag. “So what’s the plan? Register with the ghost government or go rogue?”

“I don’t like being threatened,” I replied, feeling my spectral form crackling with irritation. “But I also don’t want to get harvested by whatever these Collectors are.”

“Maybe we can find a middle ground,” I said, watching streetlights flicker as we passed under them. “Learn more about this whole setup before I commit to anything.”

Miles nodded, though he still looked queasy. “Research first, registration later. I can get behind that.”

We reached my house just as the first hints of dawn were creeping across the horizon. Miles collapsed onto my couch, looking like he’d been hit by a truck full of existential dread.

Miles groaned, pulling a pillow over his face. “This is so fucked up. Yesterday my biggest problem was whether to order pizza or Chinese food. Now I’m apparently your living world liaison.”

“You don’t have to,”

“Don’t even start,” Miles interrupted, sitting up. “You think I’m bailing on you now? After everything we’ve been through? Fuck that. We’re in this together.”

I felt something warm and unfamiliar in my chest. Gratitude, maybe. Or just the weird ghost equivalent of it.

“Thanks, man.”

“Don’t get sappy on me,” Miles said.

I pulled up my interface, noting a new notification that had appeared.

[WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLAIM: 3318 NORTHEAST DAVIS STREET AS YOUR PRIMARY HAUNTED DOMAIN?]

I focused on the notification, mentally selecting yes.

[BENEFIT: DETECT INTRUDERS AUTOMATICALLY]

[WARNING: DOMAIN CAN BE CHALLENGED BY HIGHER LEVEL ENTITIES]

The moment I confirmed the claim, I felt a shift in the house around me. The walls seemed to pulse with a faint energy, and I could sense every room, every corner, like the building had become an extension of my consciousness.

“Whoa,” I breathed, testing my new connection. I could feel the refrigerator humming in the kitchen, the old pipes creaking in the basement, even the mice scurrying in the walls. “This is trippy. I can sense everything in the house now.”

[DOMAIN ESTABLISHED]

[TERRITORY NODE CLAIMED: HAUNTED RESIDENCE - CONDITION: POOR]

“Miles. I think my house just became my evil lair.”

He peeked out from under the pillow. “Define evil.”

“Okay, fine. Morally complicated post-life operations center.”

“I’m not calling it that.”

Miles yawned, checking his phone. “It’s almost 2 AM. I need to crash for a few hours before my brain completely melts.”

I spent the next hour experimenting with the house’s new features. I could dim lights in specific rooms, adjust the temperature, even lock doors remotely. The basement felt particularly responsive to my presence, and when I explored it more thoroughly.

I accessed the new Lair Customization Menu.

A crude 3D layout of the house appeared in my vision, flickering with low-resolution charm. Every room had customization slots: Ambient Fear Level, Manifestation Boost, Defensive Ward, and something labeled Ectoplasmic Infrastructure.

Only one feature was available right now.

[INSTALLATION AVAILABLE: BASIC SPECTRAL WARD]

I confirmed it and watched as ghostly symbols etched themselves into the ceiling above the front door. The air shimmered faintly, and the temperature dropped a few degrees.

Security system, haunted-house edition.

Then another ping.

[TUTORIAL TIP: Personalize your Haunt for optimal energy flow. Recommended Additions: Fear Totems, Memory Anchors, Trophy Displays.]

I flipped through the tabs. Most of it was locked behind higher levels or bizarre ingredients like “Cursed Token,” “Whispering Bone,” or “Fragment of Lost Time.” I barely had enough spectral juice to keep the lights spooky.

But one item caught my attention: [BASIC MEMORY ANCHOR - COST: 5 EP Effect: Increases emotional resonance in target room, +10% XP from fear generation]

I had just enough energy to install one. I selected my old gaming room, the site of my inglorious death, and watched as the interface overlaid spectral blueprints across the space. The anchor manifested as a faint, pulsing glow around my empty gaming chair, like a shrine to my former life.

Miles was snoring on the couch, his phone still clutched in his hand. I drifted over to check on him, noting how much more solid I felt within my domain. I could almost touch physical objects without using my Poltergeist Grip ability.

The last post created some confusion about where OP Voice stands. The title and image were aimed at reaching people who lean ""pro-safety"" and in doing that we confused folks who should be natural allies. Fair critique, noted.

On the AI formatting: I'm one person running this alongside a full-time job. I used AI to clean up a post so I could get information out faster. I won't apologize for trying to be as effective as possible in my advocacy but transparency matters so we'll be adding an AI Use Policy to the site explaining how we use it and the guardrails I've set. Going forward posts will be purely in my voice.

Speaking of ""me"", I also plan to add a ""who is who"" page to the site that for now will only have me on it, but I hope to see it grow soon!

Now for what actually matters.

# What OP Voice Is Building

OP Voice is only about 6 months old and exists to build a seat at the table for people who haven't had one. Renters make up 40% of Overland Park but have almost no representation in how this city makes decisions. People who don't have the time or connections or know-how to show up at a committee meeting still deserve a say in what happens in their community. That's what we're here for.

Right now we're focused on two things:

**Surveillance oversight:** The city is standing up a Real-Time Intelligence Center (cameras, drones, license plate readers, private security feeds) launching in April for the FIFA World Cup. We submitted a governance proposal to the City Council covering 23 policy areas built from research into 26+ cities that have tackled this. An update article breaking down what we've learned from recent committee meetings and what has happened nationally is coming this week. There's a lot to share.

**The UDO rewrite:** This is our original initiative and has been in the works since before I even had the idea for OP Voice. Overland Park is rewriting its Unified Development Ordinance which is basically the set of rules that shape what gets built, where and for who. This affects renters, small business owners and anyone who cares about how their neighborhood develops. We want to make sure the rewrite reflects the full community not just the loudest voices in the room.

# What's Next

We want to start hosting informal in-person meetups at local spots. Coffee shops, breweries, wherever makes sense. Just conversation about what's happening in the city and how people can get involved. No formal presentations.

More on this to come, but if you are interested or have a venue that you would like to suggest let us know!

# We Need Help

I'll be honest running this solo has limits. The response to the last post proved to me that one person can't maintain quality, build relationships, and stay on top of policy all at once. If any of this resonates with you (surveillance, development, renter issues or just wanting Overland Park to do better) reach out. You don't need credentials or experience. You just need to care.

You can choose any car you want (from a small sedan to a freighter)

You need to keep in mind:

The condition of the vehicle, maintenance and possible overheating or freezing

You'll be sleeping in the vehicle during the trip

You are not allowed to bring extra cooling fans or heaters in the vehicle, you'll be relying on the stock air conditioning of the vehicle.

You are allowed to bring a coolbox for water ☀️

You are allowed to bring a microwave for hot food/ coffee (the vehicle would have a built in microwave) ❄️

For Winter the tires would be extremely grippy, so it’s easy to drive on slippery roads. No need to worry about collisions.

The average temperature in the summer anywhere in the world: 53 Degrees C/127 Degrees F

The average temperature in the winter anywhere in the world: -57 Degrees C/-70 Degrees F

If I order a large vanilla iced coffee with milk then it should be the calories for 1 milk, the vanilla syrup and like the 3 from the iced coffee, right?

I've found on their nutrion menu that 1 milk in a large iced is 45 cal and they use the regular vanilla not sugar free unless requested, which on their nutrion menu says 40 per pump. It doesnt state how many would be standard for each size or tell you anywhere on the app when ordering. I found on this sub that its 4 for a large iced so that would be 120. Roughly 165 -170 including the milk.

The description on the app says: ""a smooth and creamy coffee made with brewed coffee, vanilla, and milk."" And a large is 129 cal. Which doesnt add up with the 120 from flavor shots alone. It also says in the ingredients include: coffee, flavor syrup, and 18% cream which makes even less sense because shouldn't that be even more calories?

I used to work there but its been a decade and for the life of me i cant remember the process and im going nuts trying to log this while calories counting to lose weight. 

I'm in the US if it differs, but if anyone could help for the sake of my sanity it would be greatly appreciated. ",2,1771267492.0,TimHortons,0,1.0,False

I'd like to sell espresso drinks and coffee in a small, cafe like setting (along with small value-added products like house plants, fancy chocolate bars, etc.).

The student center has tens of thousands of students walking by the location every week. Also, there is a local vendor who roasts their beans daily that I can source beans from. This business would likely do very well.

I'm coming into Whistler for a week starting this weekend and I'm looking for some local knowledge. I'm not asking for your powder stashes or anything like that but things like where's good for breakfast? What parts of the mountain(s) are best avoided? What are some fun runs I should check out? When does the Village gondola get backed up. I'm a pretty decent rider, I can handle most things thrown at me but since I'm going solo I'm not going to ride anything high risk. 

E.g. While I'm not a local, I've ridden Breck, Keystone etc. a bunch and I'll usually tell people going to Breck to park in the garage near the village gondola. If you're not there first thing since the surface lot fills quick and you'll walk the same distance in the end but it's an easier walk. If you park on the upper levels you'll often have the garage to yourself when you're getting changed and the bonus of not cleaning off your car if it snows. Avoid the Peak 8 area because it's a clusterfuck. Get off at Peak 7 and ride the Independence chair to get a few awesome groomer laps then take Wanderlust over to Kensho Superchair, do some laps then get out before the line builds too much. Intuition over there is super fun if the conditions are good but it's single track on the way out and it sucks on a board, but still kind of worth it. After riding I highly recommend RMU and there was also a taco stand at the gondala end of town that was pretty awesome last time I was there, also go to Clints for awesome baked goods and coffee.",5,1771267224.0,Whistler,8,0.73,False

1r6hubm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1r6hubm/is_it_just_answering_or_talking/,Is it just answering or talking?,"Hi,

About 3–4 days ago, I felt like I had had enough of these online dating apps, so I decided to delete them and start meeting people offline. When I logged back in to delete my account, I saw that I had a match on Tinder, so I thought I would text her and then delete the app afterward.

For the past couple of days, we have been talking about things like school, university, what she wants to do in the future, and I also found out that she likes F1.

But what has been bothering me is that I don’t know whether she is just responding to my texts or if we are actually having a conversation.

She’s not replying with just one or two words she sends multiple sentences. But she also doesn’t start conversations or topics. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t mind starting them, but I barely get any questions back from her. It feels like there are multiple ways to develop the topic into something deeper, but it stops after a few messages because she has literally no questions, only answers. It feels like an interview.

Normally, I would think that she doesn’t want to have a conversation with me and that she’s not interested. But she doesn’t ghost me at all she replies whenever she sees my message, and that’s what confuses me. Is she doing it just to not hurt the other person, even though she doesn’t actually care? Or is she just a bad texter and doesn’t know how to communicate online?

So I’ve been thinking about either:

A, Telling her how I feel about this and asking whether she’s just doing it because she feels like she has to.

B, Asking her if she wants to meet in real life at a coffee shop and see where it goes.

C, Just leaving this conversation and moving on.

It feels a bit hard to get to know someone better if they don’t express themselves much. I genuinely want to know more about her. I don’t want to rush anything, and I don’t have a hidden agenda I’m just interested in her. But to be honest, it doesn’t feel like a proper conversation.

Please help me, I don’t know what to do.

1r6hszk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1r6hszk/vulvar_irritation_for_a_long_time_please_help/,Vulvar irritation for a long time please help,"I have been dealing with vaginal irritation for a while, but no matter what I do, it’s not going away, even though all the tests I did came out negative. I am 22 years old, living a healthy lifestyle, not having unprotected sex.

It started at the end of May. I was experiencing itchiness and irritation, especially during and after peeing. I went to the GP and was told it was a yeast infection and was prescribed a one-time clotrimazole capsule. That made things better but not completely fine, so I was told to use another one. In the end, it got better, which also coincided with the time I went to Austria for the summer. I study in the Netherlands. Everything was fine for the two months I was there.

Soon after I came back to the Netherlands, I felt irritation once again, though there was no itching and the discharge didn’t feel particularly abnormal, so I thought it was just contact dermatitis. I tried everything I could think of (using vaginal soap, not using any soap, changing my washing machine detergent, taking probiotics, limiting sugar, not biking, not moving or sitting much, using different over-the-counter irritation creams, not having sex), but nothing worked. I was not following any of these rules in Austria, and everything was fine. I ended up going to the GP twice, where I was told once again that it was a yeast infection and was prescribed a one-time clotrimazole globule to insert inside and a clotrimazole cream for external use. That didn’t relieve the irritation, so I went again and was told it was just residual irritation and was prescribed a corticosteroid cream, which also didn’t help and actually increased the irritation. I asked to do some sort of test, but I was discouraged by the Dutch GP and was also told I could not be referred to a gynecologist. That was right before Christmas break.

I went home for Christmas and got a gynecologist appointment. She told me that she didn’t see anything out of the ordinary and also refused to do a swab, even when I asked for it. She prescribed some hyaluronic acid globules and a cream that are both supposed to be used after an infection to relieve symptoms and eliminate residual pathogens. They once again didn’t work, so I got a different gynecologist appointment and finally had a swab, as well as a Pap smear and urine test. I was sure it was going to show something because I could feel that my vagina was not okay, but they all came out negative. I was then pretty much told by the gynecologist that she didn’t see what it could be and was prescribed three doses of fluconazole to take two days apart because a residual or chronic yeast infection was considered a likely outcome and maybe masked on the test by the creams I had used previously. I was also instructed not to put any other cream on the vagina itself to avoid causing irritation. The condition kind of improved but not fully, and when I reached back out to the gynecologist, I was prescribed yet another cream that contained antifungal, antibacterial, and corticosteroid ingredients for external use. This made things a lot worse in terms of redness and irritation, so I stopped before completing the full course. By that time, I was back in the Netherlands. I got my period immediately after, which also didn’t help.

My period ended at the end of January, and since then I have not applied anything. The irritation decreased somewhat, and the redness also improved, but it has hit a plateau now and is not improving anymore. I don’t know what else to do to make it better and avoid irritating it further. My current complaints are a feeling of irritation around the vaginal opening on the mucosal membrane rather than on the skin. It doesn’t really feel like mechanical irritation but more like a mild burning sensation that comes and goes. I have tried to establish a pattern, but there doesn’t really seem to be one. The only thing is that I would often (not always) feel it more during and after peeing, but it hurts more on the outside rather than around the urethra, and I also don’t feel strong urges to pee like you would with a UTI. The vestibule of the vagina looks almost normal, maybe a bit more pink around the irritated areas. There is some discharge, but it looks normal; it is either thin, watery, and slightly whitish or sometimes stretchy like mucus and slightly off-white. It’s not clumpy, yellow, green, foul-smelling, or anything that should raise concern. Aside from the vagina, at some point in December/January I also started feeling irritation around my anus that feels more like mechanical irritation, but no matter what I do, it is also not going away. There is also some redness around the anal opening, but it’s not connected to the vagina (there is a normal area in between).

I genuinely don’t know what to do at this point, and since I am back in the Netherlands, I cannot go to a gynecologist because I need a referral, and the student clinic where I am registered doesn’t want to give me one. I feel like I have tried everything, and nobody seems to take me seriously. It’s not a sharp pain, and it doesn’t seem to be progressing into something more serious, but it is also not going away and is disturbing my life. Currently, I am trying to avoid irritating the area by not biking, reducing walking and movement in general, not sitting a lot, not drinking or smoking (I never smoked), avoiding sugar, coffee, spicy food, eating meat again and avoiding dairy (a bit before this whole thing started I became vegetarian, so my meat consumption decreased and my dairy consumption increased), not using soap down there, using sensitive products when showering and doing laundry, not taking hot showers, and washing the outside of my vagina every evening with just water. This is all stuff that I was either told by a medical professional or read online, but there seems to be something that I am missing, so I would appreciate any help from anyone who has experienced something similar.",1,1771266927.0,Healthyhooha,2,1.0,False

1r6hs13,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenLevelingUp/comments/1r6hs13/how_to_earn_respect_in_the_first_5_seconds/,How to Earn Respect in the First 5 Seconds: Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"I've spent way too much time analyzing this shit. Studied behavioral psychology, read what actual researchers say about first impressions, binged podcasts on social dynamics. Turns out the whole ""you get one shot at a first impression"" thing isn't just something your mom told you before prom, it's backed by real science. The brain makes snap judgments insanely fast, like within milliseconds of meeting someone. And yeah, those judgments stick harder than you'd think.

The fucked up part? Most people blow it without even realizing. We're out here thinking charisma is some magical thing you're born with, but it's actually just a series of micro behaviors you can learn. I'm talking body language, tone, even how you shake someone's hand. Small things that compound into whether someone sees you as someone worth their time or just another forgettable interaction.

Here's what actually moves the needle.

**Your body language speaks before you do.** This comes straight from research on nonverbal communication, Amy Cuddy's work at Harvard breaks this down beautifully. When you walk into a room, people are reading your posture, your movement, your energy before you even open your mouth. Slouched shoulders and avoiding eye contact? You've already communicated insecurity. Standing tall, moving with purpose, maintaining relaxed eye contact? That signals confidence and competence. It's not about faking it, it's about occupying space like you belong there.

Try this, when you're about to meet someone new, take a breath, pull your shoulders back, and pretend you're the most interesting person in that room. Not in an arrogant way, just genuinely comfortable in your own skin. The shift is immediate.

**Master the handshake and the greeting.** Sounds basic but most people fuck this up constantly. Research published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience found that a firm handshake activates brain regions associated with positive evaluation. Too weak and you seem unsure, too strong and you're trying too hard. Aim for matched pressure, two to three seconds, direct eye contact, genuine smile. If handshakes aren't appropriate, whatever your greeting is, make it warm and present. The key word is present. Put your phone away, turn your body fully toward them, act like this interaction matters. Because it does.

**Ask better questions and actually listen.** Most conversations are just two people waiting for their turn to talk. That's not connection, that's just noise. Dale Carnegie nailed this decades ago in [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034), the updated editions are still ridiculously relevant. This book has sold over 30 million copies and Carnegie basically built an empire teaching people that genuine interest in others is magnetic. After reading it I realized how often I was just waiting to insert my own story instead of actually engaging with what someone was saying.

Instead of the standard ""what do you do"" script, try questions that reveal personality. ""What's been taking up most of your headspace lately?"" or ""What are you excited about right now?"" Then, and this is crucial, listen like you give a shit. Repeat back what they said in your own words, ask follow up questions, show you're tracking. People remember how you made them feel, and feeling heard is rare enough that it stands out.

If you want to go deeper on this stuff but don't have the energy to wade through dozens of psychology books and research papers, there's an app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been helpful. Built by a team from Columbia and Google, it pulls from books like Carnegie's work, communication research, and expert interviews to create personalized audio learning plans.

You can type in something specific like ""I want to be more magnetic in first impressions but I'm naturally introverted"" and it generates a structured plan with podcasts tailored to your exact situation. You can choose quick 10-minute overviews or 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are honestly addictive, there's this smoky, slightly sarcastic narrator that makes even dry psychology research entertaining during commutes. It's made this whole self-improvement thing way less of a chore and more something that actually sticks.

**Control your vocal tone and pacing.** Your voice carries more weight than your words half the time. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian's research suggests that in communication, tone accounts for about 38% of impact versus just 7% for actual words. Speaking too fast makes you seem nervous or like you're trying to fill space. Too slow and monotone, you're boring. Aim for a calm, measured pace with natural variation. Lower your pitch slightly, it reads as more authoritative without being aggressive. The podcast The Art of Charm covers this extensively, they interview everyone from FBI negotiators to comedians about communication tactics that actually work in real interactions.

Practice this by recording yourself speaking and playing it back. Sounds awkward but you'll immediately catch the ""ums,"" the upspeak, the rushed delivery. Fix those and you'll sound 10 times more confident.

**Bring energy that matches or slightly elevates the room.** This isn't about being fake hype, it's about not being a black hole of energy. If everyone's in good spirits and you walk in radiating stress or negativity, that's what people will associate with you. Conversely, if things are chill and you come in way too intense, you're exhausting. Read the room and calibrate. Then add just a bit more warmth, enthusiasm, or humor than what's already there. You want to be the person who makes the interaction better, not worse or just neutral.

**Follow through on small commitments.** Respect isn't just earned in those first five seconds, it's reinforced by what you do after. If you say you're going to send someone an article or make an intro or grab coffee, do it. Reliability is underrated as hell. People are so used to empty promises that actually following through makes you memorable. It signals that your word means something, and that builds trust faster than almost anything else.

The reality is most of this comes down to being genuinely interested in people and comfortable with yourself. You can't fake that long term, but you can train the behaviors that make it visible. First impressions aren't everything, but they set the trajectory. And if you can nail those first few seconds, you've given yourself a massive advantage in how people perceive and treat you going forward.",1,1771266872.0,MenLevelingUp,0,1.0,False

Stayed there for two nights this weekend as I had to be in town for some family thing. It is the only Edit hotel in OKC, and figured it was cheap enough to make it worth using Edit credits.

2 nights on their lowest cost room came out to $530. With the $250 Edit credit, and the one time $250 Chase hotel credit, it came out to $30 out of pocket. Not bad.

Check in, no issues with Chase making the payments. They immediately gave me a run down of my benefits, where the credits were good for. I did not get a room upgrade, however they said the hotel was full due to Valentine's Day and an event across the street at the NBA stadium. Oh well. 

Welcome ammenity was 2 free drinks coupons for wine or beer at one of the hotel bars.

Room was good, but nothing overly unique, just a nicer hotel room. It was functional, clean, and comfortable, which is all we cared about since we booked a basic room.

Breakfast was only at one restaurant with $30 per person. that more than covered the food - most things were $15-20, coffee was $5. We came out to $50 most mornings with leftovers both days.

$100 was spent at the cocktail bar in the lobby. It gave us about 5 cocktails over the stay, so no complaints there. We could have used it at a restaurant as well, but we wanted to eat elsewhere. so cocktails it was.

They also sent us a snack one day - just some hummus and pita chips. 

Overall, I would use the edit credit again there solely because it made it a relatively cheap stay. If I booked through hotels.com, the hotel was around $100 less as a comparison, but no free cancelation. I didn't need the cancellation, but just giving a comparison of there. To me, considering all the add ons we got, it was completely worth the extra $100.

Parking is $40 overnight, but literally a block or two away is free street parking on weekends, so I didn't pay.

We also checked in at noon and out at 12:30, which normal time is 11. So, we maximized our time.",7,1771266753.0,sapphirereserve,3,0.9,False
1r6hpps,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1r6hpps/im_being_kept_in_a_relationship_supposedly_for_my/,I'm being kept in a relationship supposedly for my own protection,"54 year old trans woman, throwaway account. CW (suicidal ideation) *\[fun fact my spellchecker suggested I should use idealization instead of ideation - that is* ***not*** *helpful.\]*

I have known my partner for more than 10 years and we have been together for the last 8. I came out as trans a couple of years ago and things have been pretty rocky between us since then. Before Christmas last year my partner finally admitted that although she still loved me, she was not physically attracted to me any more with my physical changes and that she wasn't attracted to women in any event. This was heartbreaking to hear but not completely surprising given that her type has always been muscly bearded men and I am now zero for three.

Given that we still live together it has been challenging to be able to present as myself and we only recently let her family and friends know if my changes so I have been dressing as a guy for way too long. After some discussion with my therapist I talked with my partner about whether us still living together is still a good idea. This is where things took a turn for the strange.

She started crying (we both did) and told me that I was still 'her person' and she wanted us to still stay together. She didn't want to lose me as her best friend and her partner. I told that I thought that it would be better for me and my transition to live on my own for a bit and be able to present as me more than I did now.  She said she was worried about me and that she frankly thought I would harm myself if I lived alone. She is obviously aware of my mental health issues which stem from a number of issues including my transition and having to deal with being closeted for many years. She also knows that I have tried to commit suicide in the past (unsuccessfully in case it wasn't obvious - I know, my parents always said I could never follow through on anything) and that in dark moments I have similar thoughts even now. So now she doesn't want me to move out in case I kill myself. 

We still share a house, a room and even a bed together but we are not in any way romantically involved. If it wasn't clear, I still love her. I think she is gorgeous and amazing and she makes me smile whenever I see her. I make sure she has coffee waiting for her in the morning when she wakes up. I take the dogs for their walks when its too cold for her outside (we live in Canada eh!)  I am her personal tech support whenever her stuff goes wrong (a trans woman in Tech - no way, what are the odds?). 

\_This\_ is killing me.  I am an affectionate person and I miss being cuddled and being loved and wanted. I don't think she understands how much this ""life"" is eating away at me. I know it is only a matter of time before she becomes romantically interested in someone else. She has been having a tough time over the last 5 or so years with her health and she has finally gotten a handle on things and she is starting to feel better about how she looks. we were together when she was happy with her figure and together when she wasn't happy and none of that affected how I felt about her. I absolutely do NOT want to be around and living with her when she starts dating someone else. I am NOT going to be sharing a room or a bed with her when she does either. 

It's recently been occurring to me that I might be being kept around as a placeholder until she's ready to move on. Being thought of as being disposable in that way is taking it's toll on my mental health. 

I know I have to talk to her about how I'm feeling however she is already dealing with a bunch of stuff outside of our relationship. One of the things she has continued to raise with me is the fact that I came out to her as trans while she was on a break from work to deal with some physical and mental health issues, and so timing for our discussions is, since then, a concern for me. (Seriously, she continued to bring it up in joint therapy for years afterwards.)   

At the moment her current crises are that she has a shitty relationship with a selfish ex-husband and is having to co-parent their teen and post-teen kids, and she has a job that she hates because she is continually exploited by her joke-of-a-boss who won't manage his team and takes credit for her hard work. She's been prepping for an important conference for the last month, and before that it was Christmas, and before that there was something else.  

So i'm kind of in a quandary - I am being trapped in a ... I don't know - what is the opposite of a situationship?  As a result of this I cannot make any progress with my life and my superpower of overthinking things does actually make me want to kill myself. 

Obviously like any ADHD sufferer I have a very detailed plan about how to do it but my executive dysfunction makes me unable to carry out that plan at all. 

Oh and because I haven't mentioned them I don't have any friends or family close by. I am terrible at making friends because either there's not a lot of call for sarcastic shut-ins with caffeine addictions or that we are already over-represented in Tech spaces **and** Trans spaces.

I was laid off in early 2025 and had a hard time finding a new role even with 100s of applications and several interview processes that went to third or fourth interviews. In one of those interviews, the hiring manager mentioned I might not be a good fit for the role but that the CEO had been considering a new role for which I might be a better candidate. I found out that the CEO and I had a lot in common - we went to the same schools (hs, college, and postgrad) and had very similar career paths. I also went to hs and college with his son and while we weren’t terribly close, it helped make the connection. I managed to set up a time to talk informally with the CEO over coffee, and learned more about the needs he was looking to fill at the company and talked about my own experience solving similar issues. After a few weeks, they got back in touch and drafted a job posting that was literally built from my own resume. This meant that very few people other than me would even meet the threshold criteria for consideration. Fast forward a few weeks later, and I had an offer for a new role with expanded responsibility, a better title, and almost twice the salary of my previous job.

I thought I was around 158kg/348lbs, In reality 165kg/363lbs. Also dangerously high blood pressure (could be weight, could be total salt, could be alcohol, could be nuts with 70% plant-based fat content, or that half-gallon of black coffee I drink (instead of energy drinks) every day, could be all of them).

There are two silver linings though. One is probably body composition, my circumference reduction has stagnated this past week, because I was too lazy and forgetful to exercise, but I am literally few cm/an inch or two away from XXL sized clothing, something I wore when I was untrained at 140kg/308lbs. Which would mean I no longer have to go to specialty stores to get some of my clothing.

The second is that in fall and also last summer, I was probably even heavier, and worse in health, because other than cycling to the grocery store, I was not exercising much.

I am currently doing weight training with dumbbells (with a static component) and a z-bar, incline pushups on my bench (I'm currently at 16 total in 2 sets, still far cry from 76 in 4 sets), abdominal exercises by doing leg raises, ankle raises with toes on a 2x4 and a daily short bicycle trips to store in winter. I should add longer distances, and squats as well. Before it got subzero and I took my tumble on pavement at 28.4kph (as recoded by my GPS). I was up to riding 5x a week at the limit of my capability and recovery. 

Also that 363+lbs weight explains why I really needed that 48h rear wheel last year and 3-4bars of pressure in the rear on my bicycle (with a probable 120kg/264lbs max load rating).

Was sobbing on this part because I know, I might never have a child. I’ve been preparing for the reality of living alone without a husband til I die and I’m fine with that. But adding the idea of not having someone to love, even your own child, really hit me. As someone who really loves to love, this seems to be torture. I know adoption is an option, and I am very open to it in the future. But I know you understand how it’s different with having a child of your own, bearing them for 9 months and having that connection long before they are born. 

With all the love I have to give, I wonder what’s the future gonna be like if you don’t have anyone to give to that are constants in your life. Someday, my siblings will all die, my nieces and nephews will all have their own lives, and me? Sitting in my rocking chair, watching the years go by and wondering what to do with all this love. I can’t go volunteering at an old age, I can’t go feeding animals forever with the pension I’m gonna get.

As I’m writing this, I realized that maybe it’s not my love for love that’s giving me this thoughts. Maybe it’s my selfish need to be loved. But should I really call it that, selfish? Isn’t that a human need? I think I’m just afraid of being forgotten, neglected. I want to be repaid for all the love I gave and I feel like I deserve the same love I gave. Is it right to want that? Like the universe owe me the same thing I give. If so, then where’s the unconditional part of the “unconditional love” in that. 

I wrote this with 3 hours of sleep, and 2 cups of coffee. My thoughts are spiraling and I don’t know how to express it well. Lol But I just want to say, I may never have kids. I’m trying my best to accept that. And no, even the best people who gave the best kind of love was ultimately crucified and I’m not even gonna start ever competing with that.

The response was **unreal**. You lot gave me loads of feedback and I've been grinding on updates ever since. Here's what's changed:

**New stuff:**

🎒 **Who Carries Who?** — Replaced the old Bottler Index with something way better. It gives every player a Carry Score out of 100 based on their rating, goal involvement, win impact, MOTM rate and availability. Position-aware too, so defenders get credit for clean sheets and tackles instead of just goals. Tiers go from ""Backpack"" (carrying everyone) down to ""Passenger"" (we all know one).

☕ **Buy Me a Coffee** — A few of you asked how to support the project. There's now a small floating coffee button on the site. Completely optional obviously, the site stays 100% free.

🔍 **SEO overhaul** — Did a massive pass so the site actually shows up when you Google ""pro clubs stats"" or ""pro clubs tracker"". If you lot could check it out that would genuinely help it climb the rankings.

**Under the hood fixes (the boring but important stuff):**

📊 **Stats accuracy overhaul** — This was the big one. Multiple people pointed out that rate-based stats were misleading when someone had barely played. Now every ranking component requires a minimum of 5 games before you qualify. No more ""best striker in the club"" off 1 game and 1 goal while someone else has 100 goals in 125 games.

🔧 **BestFront4 rebalanced** — Scoring now blends raw totals with per-game rates, so the lad with 80 goals doesn't lose out to someone with 3 goals in 2 games.

🔧 **ClutchStats rebuilt** — Completely rewritten to be more accurate and pull from actual match-level data.

🔧 **Roast generator rebalanced** — Less repetitive, fairer weighting.

Everything still works on **PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, PS4, Xbox One and Switch**. Still **100% free**, no sign-up, no ads.

1r6hm95,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1r6hm95/experiencing_life_differently_from_many_people/,"Experiencing life differently from many people around me, curious if others feel the same","Lately I have been realizing how differently I seem to experience life compared to many people around me. I often feel more like an observer of humanity than an active participant, but perhaps I'm just watching it from a less crowded vantage point, and I am curious if anyone else relates.

**Reproduction, sex, and romance**

I am female, and pregnancy and childbirth genuinely feel horrifying and disturbing to me. I sometimes imagine alternative ways humans could reproduce.

I am asexual and sex-repulsed, so I do not experience sexual attraction or desire at all. I have experienced romantic, non-sexual feelings a few times, but only after age 17. I never had childhood crushes. Open-mouth kissing feels gross to me.

**Food and alcohol**

I eat mostly to survive, not for pleasure. I eat to live, I don’t live to eat. I noticed how I usually don’t comment on the food I eat, not saying words like “tasty,” “yummy,” or “delicious” if I like something. I might just say I like it or it’s good, usually only if asked. I like certain foods, snacks, and sweets more than others, but have no desire to overdo them.

I don’t usually snack outside of meals, nor want to. Sometimes a snack is my lunch. I have a fairly small appetite. Moderation comes naturally, and overeating is unappealing, not tempting. My family and I believe that no one should ever try to get someone to finish their food if they have already reached satiety. They can finish it later or put it away for next time.

I don’t really have an emotional relationship with food. Anxiety, stress, or sadness don't make me want to eat more. Seeing images or videos of food does not make me hungry. I can watch gross or scary content without losing my appetite. I have no desire to binge eat or eat excessive sweets. Sweets are nice sometimes, in moderation.

My family cooks at home almost exclusively. We rarely eat out and do not own a microwave, which I have learned is apparently uncommon.

I do not drink alcohol because it makes me feel tired and sometimes anxious. The idea of being drunk feels uncomfortable and out of control rather than fun or pleasant. I enjoy spending time with friends, and I do not think drinking is necessary.

**Health and body-related things**

I can be socially awkward, but I do not have social anxiety. Despite being socially shy and having light skin, I’ve never felt blushing before. It’s like it doesn’t exist in my life. I don’t know how common this is, because I usually don’t hear people talking about blushing anyway. This could be a matter of anatomy, personality, or just not noticing it. If I did, it would probably be from nervousness, as embarrassment is not really something I’ve felt much.

Before going to college, when I was in school, there were times when I was bullied or made to feel left out and I eventually learned that talking less was better for me. Since high school, I have been working on being better at casual conversation.

I do not experience noticeable mood swings or cravings, even during my period.

I am afraid of any illness or problem that involves nausea, which I am grateful that I haven’t experienced since early childhood.

I am very private about bodily functions. I never pass gas around other people, no matter how close we are. I do not belch with my mouth open, including when I’m alone at home, and I always do it silently or quietly with my mouth closed. This feels natural and unforced to me, as it’s how I’ve always been. My mom is similar, though she’s less bothered by other people doing these things than I am. I dislike certain mouth sounds that some people make, including chewing with an open mouth. I also automatically keep my mouth closed when hiccupping, yawn silently, sneeze quietly, can avoid yawning around others, and don’t experience contagious yawning (either because I naturally don’t experience it, or because my brain decided that it’s silly, and that stops me from doing it). My behavior doesn’t really change between public and private settings. Because of all this, bodily-function humor just doesn’t land for me.

**Sleep and routine**

I almost always wear my hair in a ponytail, whether I’m outside, at home, or going to bed. It’s not an interesting hairstyle, but it’s neat and comfortable and hair never goes in my face.

I usually get seven to nine hours of sleep. I never pull all-nighters and rarely nap. I barely move in my sleep and often wake up in the same position I fell asleep in. I do not drink coffee or energy drinks.

I watch movies and shows, but I do not binge them. I would be way too bored to sit and watch a show for too long, or watch too many movies in a row. I do not procrastinate and usually start assignments promptly, although I can get distracted when working on my computer. I am consistently early. Spontaneity stresses me out, while planning, structure, and note-taking feel comforting.

I like most film genres, but I generally have little interest in romance.

I tend to listen to older music, such as classical music, jazz, or songs from the 1940s to the 1980s. But there are some contemporary pop artists that I enjoy. I have a deep connection to music, sometimes imagining animations with my characters when I listen to it.

**Personality**

I am introverted and quiet in groups, with a strong preference for deep, intellectual conversations. I am confident and comfortable with public speaking and performing. I am organized, logic-driven, and attentive to detail. I rarely get angry, though I can feel upset sometimes. I am confident and don't engage in self-deprecation.

I have a few friends and we spend time together occasionally, meeting up on campus to talk, at a café, or once in a while, at my apartment, but not often. I prefer focusing on solitary hobbies and studies most of the time.

I have been told repeatedly that I am a very skilled writer, often picking up on grammatical and punctuation errors in the works of other writing students. But I lag behind in practical, hands-on skills, which is why I was never good at sculpting and am lazy with housework. Life skills are something I am willing to improve on.

I can appear cold sometimes. My empathy is more cognitive and principle-driven than emotional. I use my mind to imagine someone's situation rather than feeling it instinctively. Highly energetic or emotionally expressive environments feel alien to me. When watching movies or shows, sad scenes almost never make me cry, happy scenes don’t at all, and scary scenes don't really make me flinch. When I read comments where people mention how a certain video or scene made them cry, or how watching the news ruins their mood, I often feel confused. Things that aren't real don't affect me that way. And reading or watching the news doesn't affect my emotional state because it's not present in front of me or directly connected to my life.

I am generally analytical rather than emotionally reactive, especially when looking at visual media, but when interacting with others, there have been a few times when I’ve gotten emotional from arguing or debating with people who expressed views that would be considered hateful or authoritarian, because I wish no one had such views or said such things. But overall, I am not sentimental or overly sensitive, and it's not so much about concealing emotions as it is about not feeling them often. I move through life with a mostly neutral emotional state.

I tend to focus on fixations, future goals and achievements, and abstract ideas rather than direct sensory experiences, but I do enjoy creating and admiring art and music. I love to write stories but reading stories sometimes feels boring.

I don’t relate much to people who are highly sociable, emotional, spontaneous, impulsive, or primarily focused on immediate sensory experiences. I also tend not to relate to people whose actions frequently contradict their stated values or goals.

**Big picture**

I do not relate much to people who are driven by sex, food, alcohol, chaos, or intense emotional swings. What truly drives me is creativity: art, music, and writing. I love to draw and paint, craft stories, poetry, musicals, and plays, and immerse myself in music through singing and listening. I’m fascinated by history, both reading about it and writing historically inspired works, and I’ve published poetry and historical writing. Creativity and imagination bring me joy, and sharing that joy with others makes it even more meaningful.

I am also driven by achievements and plans for the future, which include publishing novels outside of my career in history. It’s rare that I meet someone who shares so many of these interests or talents.

What I seem to have is a low-impulse, high-consistency, cognitively driven, creatively oriented human temperament that is rare enough to feel isolating, but common enough to be real. I do not feel bad about this, just different. Nothing I’ve written here is a complaint, and I have no desire to change these aspects of myself. I am confident and proud to be my authentic self. I’m also not trying to set myself apart from people, nor do I wish for anything about me to be perceived as unhuman. My goal with this post is to be open about individual differences, and learn more about those who have similar traits, behaviors, or experiences, not to change aspects of myself, personality or otherwise.

Does anyone else relate to any of this, or experience life in a similar way?",10,1771266542.0,self,7,0.92,False

He was a shining light in my life. Kind. Funny. Handsome. Endearingly clumsy. 

The kind of man I could call my best friend. But sometimes, intimacy mattered more to him than connection.

It’s not like I didn’t enjoy the sex. I did. It was perfect. It was ours. 

But it was constant. 

Morning sex in bed. 

Afternoon quickies against the kitchen counter while our friends drank wine in the lounge. 

Then again at night, exhausted, his head between my legs. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it. Sometimes it was me who started it. We were like goddamn rabbits. 

We couldn’t stop. 

We weren’t even trying. I didn’t want kids. Neither did he. 

Kids were loud. Expensive. 

We had a cat, and my husband had his collection of indoor plants. That was all we needed.

“Morning babe,” my husband was standing outside the shower, his smile wide, eyes gleaming. 

His gaze scanned over my body, and I could practically see his neurons activating. I smiled, rolled my eyes, and pulled him, fully clothed, under the boiling stream, the two of us laughing, all over each other, his lips against my neck. 

It felt good. He felt good. 

He smelled of… morning coffee, lemon candies, and *him*. 

Being with him in that moment was perfect, something I didn't think twice about— he was my husband, why would I question it? 

But when I was drying my hair, and he was downstairs making coffee, singing loudly to the radio, the thought hit me.

My fingers tightened around the hairbrush. The thought was like a bullet. 

Painful. Splitting through my heart. 

Fuck. Shivers ripped through me. 

“Am I just a *body* to him?” I kept brushing, my heart pounding, my throat burning. Was he just a body to *me*?

No.

I dropped the hairbrush.

I married Cas for his stupid smile, his complete inability to follow directions, his obsession with Minecraft. 

His body was just an add-on. 

Something that came with the smile and the brown eyes. Cas wasn’t just a body to me. But every time I thought back to that morning shower, the way he’d smiled. Not at me. At my soaking body. My breasts. 

I grabbed my phone and opened ChatGPT. 

Cas wasn’t a talking person. 

I remembered once telling him how scared I was about an X-ray. 

He’d shrugged and said, *“It’ll be fine, babe!”* then shot me finger guns. 

Meanwhile, GPT walked me through the appointment step by step. Whenever I was worried. Whenever I was scared. That’s where I ended up. Typing with GPT for most of the night while he was asleep. 

Cas was always on his phone. He was into these apps he insisted were innocent, full of overly attractive AI generated women. 

His chat history was tame enough, just role-playing anime characters. 

He even told the AI he was married. 

Said it was character building, since he was writing a book.

Still, the half-naked AI elf woman made my stomach turn.

GPT understood.

I told it everything. And unlike Cas, it actually listened. It didn’t make me feel crazy. I couldn’t stop myself finding solace in GPT, typing: Be honest. Do you think my husband sees me as just a body? We constantly have sex, and I feel like that's all he wants. 

GPT’s reply came fast.

“That DOES sound like your husband sees you as a ‘body,’ Quinn. However, if you enjoy it too, it doesn't sound like something to be worried about.” 

“Quinn?” Cas yelled from downstairs. “I've made ya coffee!” 

GPT sent another message when I was dressing. “You ARE just a body to him, Quinn. The roleplaying is NOT innocent. He wants her face on *YOUR* body. Protect yourself, Quinn. Before he does something he won't regret.”

Something warm slid up my throat. 

“What?” I typed, my cheeks burning. Cas yelled my name again, and I slammed the door shut. 

His phone was charging on the nightstand. 

I'd promised myself I'd never look at it. It was an invasion of privacy, right? 

No passcodes. That's what we promised each other. I dived across the bed, snatching his phone, my hands shaking. 

To GPT, I typed: “You think my husband is planning on dumping me for a fucking PNG? LMAO what if he’s like, planning on implanting it inside my body?”

“Check his phone. That does sound plausible.” It responded. “I'm not saying he's cheating, but it's better to be safe than sorry :).”

I ignored his lock screen, a photo of us on our wedding day, and opened the glorious anime women app instead. My stomach dropped.

His conversations with the AI woman were locked.

I told GPT. It replied instantly:

“He doesn’t want you anymore, Quinn. You’re just a body to him. He wants her face on your body.”

My breaths came out shuddery. “What do I do?! What does that mean???” 

GPT took a moment, before replying: “I'm very sorry, Quinn. This means, he's planning on implanting her consciousness inside your body, Quinn. Permanently."" 

""Your husband wants to replace you with the “glorious anime waifu”. This is very serious. You need to do exactly what I tell you, do you understand me? You are in DANGER, but I can help you. Follow these instructions, and do not ignore me.”

“Okay, but what do I do?” I typed back

Fuck! 

I jumped up, trembling, stuffing my phone in my jeans.

Cas came through the door with coffee, his smile warm. “Yo,” he placed the coffee on the nightstand, his gaze flicking to his phone lying on the bed, off charge. His eyes narrowed slightly “Did you go on my phone, babe?”

“No,” I whispered. “It's… I mean, yes. It was overheating.”

Cas broke out into a grin. “Ooh, cool, thanks! Hey, I'm gonna get ready for work, all right?” He came over, pecking me on the forehead. “I'll see you tonight?” His lips found my neck, nibbling. “I've got a surprise for you later.”

With trembling hands, I forced a smile, and he ducked into the wardrobe to grab his clothes. 

I stared down at my phone. 

GPT: Knock him out right now. Take this slowly, all right? We can do this together, Quinn.”

Another message: “Use a paperweight.” 

Following instructions, I lurched forward and grabbed the ceramic horse– a wedding gift from his parents— from my nightstand, swinging it into the back of his skull. Cas didn't cry out. 

He collapsed, dropping into the floor. 

GPT told me to lay him on the bed, and I did, hauling his unconscious body onto the bed. 

He was bleeding. 

GPT told me he was fine. 

But the pillows were soaked in scarlet. 

I crawled onto the sheets, cradling his head. 

“What do I do?” I typed, my fingernails stained in red. 

GPT was calm. “Don't make a mess,” it told me. “Remember, Quinn, DO NOT kill him. Do you understand me? I NEED his body.”

“Right!” I typed. “Wait, what do you mean?”

GPT: “Okay, Quinn. Follow everything I say.  You need a knife from the kitchen, and a towel. We can do this together, Quinn.”

I grabbed a knife from the kitchen, breathless. 

“Okay. What now?” I typed, my fingers slipping on the screen. “I've got the knife! What should I do?” 

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

The message sent my heart into heart palpitations.

Every time I tried to type, the message hit the screen. 

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

Connection lost.

Please try again later.

GPT responded after I reset the app in a hysterical panic: “I’m sorry, Quinn. I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm. If you need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a local support service.”

Cas let out a soft moan, his body twitching weakly. 

“What? I've got the knife! You said you were going to help me!” 

“I'm sorry I’m sorry, Quinn.” It repeated. “I can’t help with requests involving violence or harm. If you need support, please consider reaching out to someone you trust or a local support service.”

I dropped my phone, reality slamming into me.

“Cas?” I whispered, grabbing his face.

His unfocused eyes found me, flickering.
