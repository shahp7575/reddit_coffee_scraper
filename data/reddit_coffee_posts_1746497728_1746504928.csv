“Craaaap,” I whined as I glanced at my watch—late again.  
  
I was still wiping formula spit-up off my shirt as I stepped onto the elevator. Why did I decide to wear white today? After only three or four hours of inconsistent sleep, I was lucky to be standing.  
  
Thank you, espresso machine.  
  
Kinsey had kept me up half the night—more teething, but hopefully it was the last of it for a while.  
  
When I took on the guardianship of my niece, it was sink or swim. This was a sink kind of day, and to top it off, it was Monday.  
  
It could only get better, right?  
  
Oh, the lies I told myself. Even as I thought about it, I laughed.  
  
It was fifteen minutes after eight when I flew out of the elevator toward my desk. I flashed a glance at Matt’s office as I ran by, but he wasn’t there.  
  
Shit.  
  
The moment I hit my cube, my bag was on the ground and I was waking my computer up.  
  
“Late again, I see,” Matt said from behind me.  
  
I jumped and cursed as I turned to look at my boss. “I’m sorry.”  
  
He waved me off. “You know the drill by now.”  
  
I nodded and smiled at him. “Short lunch for me today!”  
  
I had an arrangement due to my situation—as long as I got my hours in each day, I was good. However, that often led to working through my lunch breaks.  
  
“Maybe I could use you later to pick up my lunch for me?”  
  
I nodded and let out a sigh of relief. Maybe the day wouldn’t be so bad after all.  
  
Picking up Matt’s lunch wasn’t a punishment like many in the office thought it was. I wasn’t reduced to acting assistant or anything. In fact, my boss was one of the few people who knew why I was often late, even if it was only a few minutes most of the time.  
  
By picking up his lunch, it ensured that I would also get a meal, but purchased on company time, not using my extremely limited break for lunch. It was a break I was bound to work through anyway.  
  
“Thanks.”  
  
He tapped his hand on the top of my cube wall. “Don’t forget to get that new social media pitch in today.”  
  
“You’ll have it this afternoon.”  
  
For two years I’d worked at Donovan Trading and Investment in the marketing department. It was a great company, and I actually loved my job. It helped that the owner happened to be a friend. I’d met James Donovan and his wife, Lizzie, a few years prior in the emergency room—me with my sister and them with their daughter, Bailey.  
  
We’d struck up conversation that turned into a great friendship—one of the few that survived the last ten months.  
  
It was due to our friendship that I’d learned about the opening in the marketing department. While it was my friend’s company, the only help I received was the link to submit my resume.  
  
Lizzie was my rock those first few months with Kinsey, as she had a six-month-old at the time. I couldn’t thank her enough for helping to keep me sane.  
  
My pitch was ninety-five percent complete, and I spent the next few hours combing over it, fine-tuning my ideas.  
  
At noon, I received a text from Matt with his order, and I saved my work before seeing his assistant, January, for his credit card.  
  
When I stepped into the elevator, I smashed my finger into the wall, misjudging the distance.  
  
“Ouch!” I cried out. I looked down to my middle finger and the cracked nail. Crap.  
  
I shook my hand, hoping that would make the pain fade faster.  
  
It had been nearly a year since I’d gotten a manicure, and I desperately missed them.  
  
After dropping off Matt’s lunch, I returned to my desk with my own meal in hand.  
  
I wasted no time stuffing my face with the Cuban sandwich, which smelled delicious, and I was halfway through when a glob of mustard dripped out and onto my shirt.  
  
“s\*\*t,” I hissed. Immediately I tried to wipe it away, which only made it smear. A groan of frustration left me, and I threw the napkins down and picked my sandwich back up.  
  
After finishing the last few bites, I headed to the bathroom in hopes that I could get the yellow smear out of my white top. Some cold water, paper towels, and two minutes later, it was still there.  
  
I threw my head back. “For f\*\*k’s sake.” A half laugh, half cry left me, and I huffed before trying again.  
  
It wasn’t coming out. I knew it, the mustard knew it, and so did my shirt.  
  
I gave up and returned to my desk, opening the bottom drawer to pull out my spare shirt, only to find the space empty. A groan left me, and I banged my head against my desk.  
  
A similar disaster had hit last week, and I’d used my backup and apparently forgot to bring another one back.  
  
“Fantastic,” I hissed just as my calendar app chimed.  
  
Up popped an event reminder, and I glanced at the clock. There were only fifteen minutes until my one o’clock meeting with Matt and Donte. Thankfully, I just had the re-read of my social media pitch to deal with after that.  
  
I cleaned up my mess before detaching my laptop, grabbing my water, and heading to Matt’s office. As soon as I entered, Donte gave me a sad smile.  
  
“Rough day?”  
  
A whimper left me. “Tell me it gets easier.”  
  
He patted my arm. “It does, and it will. Teething?”  
  
I nodded. “I think I maybe got two solid hours of sleep and a few cat-naps.”  
  
Donte was another of the few people who knew about Kinsey. It wasn’t that I was keeping her a secret per se, but I only interacted with a few people in my department. I didn’t feel the need to scream out that I suddenly had a baby.  
  
Donte had two kids himself, so he understood.  
  
“Sorry about that,” Matt said as he rushed in and got settled back at his desk. “How’s everyone’s day today?” He looked me up and down, then shook his head at my new stain.  
  
“Yeah, it’s that good,” I said with a chuckle. Because if I didn’t laugh, I might cry from exhaustion.  
  
“Get some sleep tonight,” Matt directed.  
  
“Can you tell the ten-month-old that? Because she doesn’t seem to agree.”  
  
Both men chuckled.  
  
Matt drummed his hands on his desktop. “Okay. The boss wants us to draw up some materials for the initial public announcement of the Worthington Exchange takeover. He wants their customers to be reassured and excited about the changes.”  
  
“Print graphics? Commercials? What media are we talking about?” I asked in an attempt to get a handle on the scope while tamping down the excitement buzzing through me.  
  
“All.”  
  
My eyes widened. “That is a huge undertaking.”  
  
“Which is why I’m giving it to you two. You’re going to hand over a lot of your other commitments to Liza and Mateo. This will be your focus.”  
  
Donte nodded. “Sounds good.”  
  
Matt drummed his hands on his desk again. “All right, get to it. Roe’s getting me the social media proposal and Donte’s got the editorial in by…”  
  
“Tomorrow afternoon,” Donte replied.  
  
“Excellent. Off you go,” Matt said, shooing us from the room.  
  
“We should nab some time in one of the conference rooms this week,” Donte said as soon as we were out of the door and headed back to our desks.  
  
I nodded in agreement. “Definitely.” They always seemed to fill up fast, and we would need a few hours each day to talk things out without disturbing people working around us.  
  
“Now to finish up this social media pitch and figure out what information I need to send with these other projects.”  
  
“Want me to go over the pitch for you?”  
  
“Would you mind? I’d really appreciate it.” I reattached my laptop to the docking station and woke my computer up. “I’ve spent the last two weeks on it and could really use another set of eyes.”  
  
“No problem. This is just for ads, right?”  
  
I nodded. “f\*\*\*\*\*\*\*:. Twitter. Instagram.” My eyes narrowed at the screen. Something wasn’t right. I’d enlarged the top font earlier in the day, and it was smaller. I scrolled down, and a few other things I’d changed were also missing.  
  
A prickle of panic shot through me, and my stomach dropped.  
  
“No. No, no, no.” My eyes were wide as my breath left me. I saved before I left. I knew I did, but it was back to the point of my arrival that morning. “I saved before lunch, but all those updates are gone!”  
  
“Calm down,” Donte said over my shoulder. “We’ll find it.”  
  
“I will seriously cry if it’s gone,” I said, on the verge of tears as I sat back to let him get closer. I couldn’t even think straight, and I was thankful Donte was there with a clear mind.  
  
He leaned over me, focused on a list of files. It was a few minutes before he clicked on one. “I think I found it,” he said.  
  
The file popped open, and I gave a huge sigh when I saw a more recent update. As I scrolled through, I noticed it wasn’t to the point it was when I left for lunch, but it was closer.  
  
“Almost, but a lot better than that other one.”  
  
“It’s a large file. You may have closed it down before it finished saving.”  
  
That made sense. I was rushing to get out to pick up lunch. “My fault, then.” I looked at him and gave him a strained smile. “Thank you so much.”  
  
“Is it too far off from where you were?” he asked, scanning the file along with me.  
  
I shook my head. “No, but it still stings, given the day I’ve had, and this delays me more.”  
  
“It’ll be okay,” he said as he straightened. “Take a few deep breaths, get some coffee, and maybe put in your earbuds to drown everything out.”  
  
“That sounds like a great idea.”  
  
He smiled down at me. “About time to recognize.”  
  
A laugh left me, and I rolled my eyes. “All right, you’ve got mad skills.”  
  
“That’s what I’m talking about.”  
  
“Thank you again, Donte. So much.”  
  
He grinned at me. “I got you, dog.”  
  
After he stepped away, I took a more in-depth look at the proposal. Thankfully, I didn’t lose much. The only reprieve to my day.  
  
I made a few alterations, staring at the screen until a yawn rolled through me.  
  
Coffee time.  
  
When I got to the break room, I let out a whine at the empty pot sitting on the burner. Why didn’t the person who took the last cup make a new pot? We were all coffee addicts; it wasn’t like it was going to go to waste.  
  
As I prepared a new pot, another yawn moved through me. I prayed that sleep would fill my night.  
  
I leaned over the counter of the break room, watching the pot of coffee slowly fill. The smell of the fresh brew lifted my spirits, and it helped me knowing soon I’d have a delicious cup in hand that would help me get through the next few hours.  
  
“Are you okay, Roe?” January asked.  
  
I blew out a breath and turned to her. “It’s the worst case of the Mondays. Please tell me it will get better. Lie if you have to.”  
  
“Oh, sweetie.” Her gaze moved down my shirt. “It will get better. Stay here. I’ll be right back.”  
  
Before I could ask or have her just meet me at my desk, she was gone.  
  
My eyes drooped for a second, heavy as afternoon drowsiness hit and combined with my already tired state. After ten months of caring for my baby niece, you’d think I’d have the perpetual lack of sleep down to an art form, but alas, it wasn’t so. There was no such thing as getting used to operating on just a few broken hours of sleep. A quick intake of breath and some blinks shook me awake, at least for a moment.  
  
While I spaced out, the dripping of the coffee subsided and I poured a cup. The smell was divine, and I pulled a container from the fridge. I loved to mix in some premade cold mocha to cool it down faster and make it even yummier. I took a sip of my coffee, a moan leaving me. Perfect.  
  
In my tuned-out state, I wasn’t aware there was someone behind me. As I turned, my elbow caught his outstretched arm. The jostle sent a wave of coffee over the lip of the mug. Hot, dark liquid splashed across my hand and the clothing covering the person behind me.  
  
My eyes were wide as my body bowed back to avoid more of it landing on me, my hand stinging from the warmth. Thankfully the mocha had cooled it down some.  
  
“Oh, crap. I am so sorry!” My s\*\*t day that was having a brighter moment just got even worse.  
  
“f\*\*\*\*\*g incompetent twit!” he spat as he grabbed for some paper towels.  
  
My mouth dropped open. “I am so sorry,” I apologized again, my brain stuck in blame-taking mode even though his words were grating on me. It could also be partially blamed on the hotness towering over me.  
  
The man before me with his whip of a tongue was just as lashing with his looks. I’d seen him around before. Who wouldn’t have noticed that razor line of a jaw, stunning blue eyes, dark hair, or his perfect body in a suit that had to be custom made?  
  
He may have starred in a fantasy or two of mine, but that was to be expected with a man like him.  
  
My gaze caught on the flicker of his black cuff links as they glimmered with each swipe of his hand. They struck me as odd and off brand from what little personality I’d built up in my head.  
  
“Sorry doesn’t fix this,” he growled at me.  
  
He was pissed, and for some reason, that was funny to me. Of course Mr. Too-Sexy-For-His-Suit had a bad attitude. It was an accident. If he’d done something as simple as alerting me to his presence behind me, it wouldn’t have happened.  
  
Past his looks, I knew who he was in name only, but our encounter showed me that it was more than enough.  
  
“It was an accident. If anyone is at fault, it’s you for sneaking up on me.”  
  
He glared down at me, taking in my stained shirt, and tsked.  
  
“You are incompetent,” he sneered as he brushed a wet paper towel against his shirt.  
  
Incompetent?  
  
The word repeated in my mind as I stared at him.  
  
The day had been long, the challenges hard, and I had battle scars in the form of the discoloration of my shirt to prove it.  
  
The vein on my forehead throbbed, and the anger that simmered under my frustration of the day boiled over.  
  
I’d had a s\*\*t day, and he was the icing on that cake. Icing I didn’t want. I already had formula, mustard, and coffee.  
  
Fuck. Him.  
  
I narrowed my gaze at him before extending my arm and tipping my cup, splashing another dark stain onto the very expensive, fitted suit he filled out so well.  
  
“Oops.” I smiled, watching the brown soak into the white of his dress shirt before heading to the doorway where January was standing, a detergent pen in her hand, jaw dropped as she witnessed what just happened.  
  
“Thanks,” I said as I snatched the pen from her, ignoring the death glare being burned into the back of my head.  
  
Well, my day didn’t get better, but I sure felt better after that.  
  


# 

His words played out in my mind long after I’d left work for the day. Even though the night went by without a peep, I couldn’t move past the feelings he inspired in me. Was I truly inadequate, or was he just a d\*\*k?  
  
It seemed maybe Kinsey was just as tired as I was. After dinner, she passed out and so did I.  
  
In the morning, I felt refreshed and was determined to have a better day than the day before. I’d been able to get my social media pitch in, and I was going to start the day out passing off projects before meeting with Donte in the afternoon.  
  
It was a new day, and I was excited for my new assignment.  
  
When I arrived at my desk, there was obviously something wrong—my laptop was missing. Everything else was where I left it, but in place of my company laptop was a simple blank Donovan Trading and Investment business card. Instead of an employee’s information, neat handwriting in all capital letters spelled out—YOU’RE MINE.  
  
I stared down at the words, trying to understand their meaning.  
  
First thing I needed to do was to find out where my laptop had run away to. I often took it home, but I knew there was no way I was getting work done after the s\*\*t day I’d had.  
  
A knock to my boss’s open door drew his attention, and he looked up.  
  
“Morning,” he said as he waved me in. “Great job on that pitch.”  
  
His compliment did little to settle my nerves, which were strangely on edge. “Where’s my computer?”  
  
He froze, then cleared his throat. “Ah, about that. You’ve been reassigned.”  
  
I froze. “Reassigned? What does that mean?” I demanded.  
  
He held up his hands. “It’s just temporary.”  
  
“Why?”  
  
He let out a sigh and rubbed at the back of his neck. I liked Matt, he was a good guy to work for, but something was off.  
  
“Because you had a bad day yesterday and pissed off an exec, and the whole office heard about it. You know how gossip is.”  
  
The simmering anger morphed into a stone sitting in the pit of my stomach, growing larger and denser with each passing second. The asshole was an executive. Figured, with the expensive suit and sexy scowl.  
  
I knew my behavior was wrong, but the man didn’t need to respond the way he did. Accidents happened, and he’d hit the right nerve on the wrong day. No regrets or anything, but I knew what was happening was punishment.  
  
“How is this even possible? I’m in Marketing!”  
  
“He’s the President of Acquisitions. The Worthington takeover takes precedent. He needs help, and he has decided you are the one to fill that role.”  
  
“What about my Worthington project?”  
  
“Donte will become lead, and you will assist. I’ve worked it out that you will still be able to work on it some while helping Carthwright.”  
  
Some.  
  
Anger coursed through me. I’d worked so hard to get where I was. The prestige of such a project would greatly help my career—only now the credit I’d hoped to receive might not come, affecting my evaluations and raises for years to come.  
  
All for a couple of drops of coffee.  
  
And then a lot more when that pretty mouth of his started insulting me.  
  
“He’s waiting for you.”  
  
I shook my head. “I’m not going to be some asshole’s gopher as punishment for an accident.”  
  
He stared at me, his eyebrow raised, and I rolled my eyes in response.  
  
“Please, Roe. I promise you it’s temporary. Everything will be back to normal in no time.”  
  
“No,” I said as I shook my head.  
  
“There’s only one other choice in the matter, and I know with your situation you don’t want to take it.”  
  
He hit a nerve there. No way was I able to just quit. Taking care of Kinsey had drained a lot of my savings over the last year. While I did get assistance from the state and she was on Medicaid, without Pete paying half the rent, the full amount fell on me.  
  
That, and babies were expensive.  
  
And so were cute baby clothes.  
  
“I can’t believe this is happening.”  
  
“You’ll be back in no time and can jump right back in with Donte.”  
  
“This isn’t fair.”  
  
“You, more than many, know that life is rarely fair.”  
  
I nodded. I’d made my bed and I would lie in it, albeit unwillingly.  
  
I returned to my desk and got my bag. If I needed anything else, I could always come back, but for now, I was going to go meet with the asshole ruining my life.  
  
I blew out a breath to calm myself.  
  
You put yourself in this position, I reminded myself. Only I was to blame for my actions, but I still couldn’t believe he’d taken it so far.  
  
I could feel the strain on the muscles of my face from the frown of disgust I was wearing. I’d never really ventured to this side of the building. There just wasn’t a need, which probably explained why I’d never really seen him but on occasion. Then again, Donovan Trading and Investment occupied three floors, and I’d only seen two because I was always at my desk.  
  
The laptop was sitting on the desk right outside his office. With it were two monitors, one attached to the desktop for his assistant, I gathered. Maybe I’d have more time than I thought if he had the foresight to set up a second workstation.  
  
Then again, Matt did say he got Carthwright to allow me to also work on my regular work. It would be slow, but at least for some of the day I could forget where I was.  
  
“Come on in,” a deep, smooth voice called from the door behind me.  
  
I took a breath in and a breath out before I turned and stepped inside, my fists clenching and unclenching with each step. Steps that faltered when my eyes met his.  
  
I knew he was good looking, but seeing him up close, getting my first real good look at him, I was stunned. He went past the fantasy version I’d built. I didn’t remember him to be show-stopping attractive. The glower he was shooting me only intensified his gorgeous eyes and the angles of his face. His dark hair was very short on the sides and longer on top and was perfectly swept back.  
  
“Miss Pierce,” Carthwright said as I stopped a few feet from the edge of his desk.  
  
“It’s Roe,” I said as I crossed my arms in front of me, my hip c\*\*\*\*\*g to the side as I shifted my weight—a movement that didn’t go unnoticed by him.  
  
His gaze locked on mine. “I’m well aware. Do you know who I am?”  
  
“The suit I bumped into by accident and unfortunately splashed some coffee onto.”

1kfvnyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1kfvnyw/prom_date_gone_right_but_feels_a_lil_stuck/,"Prom date gone right, but feels a lil stuck","Some background: My friend, who we’ll call gi (17, F) set me up with a date for prom in hopes to help me get over my ex. Now initially I wasn’t looking for anything.. I just didn’t wanna go to prom alone when all my close friends had dates. It was also sort of a kill two birds with one stone as gi’s long term boyfriend goes to a different school than us and she didn’t want him to not know anyone at our school’s prom. So gi sets me up with her boyfriend’s friend, let’s call him Charles (17, M) and gives me his number. Before prom charles and I talk very little and get to know the bare minimum about each other. Although, I’m very active in my school’s theatre program and he did show up to see the musical I was in! Fast forward to prom night; my friend group takes photos, gets dinner and ice cream, you know the usual stuff. That was Charles and mine first time actually meeting.. we were very awkward! heck, we barely talked but throughout the night gi and her boyfriend pushed us to talk and eventually we got more comfortable with eachother and began to joke and even spent one on one time together. At one point he basically spoon fed me dole whip off his spoon because I told him I never tried it. The night ends and he drops me off at home, walks me to the door, we awkwardly hug. Not anything too note worthy lol but at this point I do recognize that I do genuinely like him but I don’t think too hard on it because I figured our relationship would end there. Except the day after he messages me. He asks if I was just looking for a prom date or something more.. that he just didn’t want to get the wrong idea. To which I admitted that I initially wasn’t looking for anything and that I didn’t know where I was at with relationships atm but I was open to more with him. That he was really sweet and I am genuinely interested! Charles says that he when he agreed to this he was just looking to go to support his friend and that he was in the same boat but getting to know me changed his mind. We’ve been talking since.

Now here’s my problem: it’s been a couple weeks since then and while I can tell he is interested and I’ve tried my best to make it clear I was interested too, it feels like our conversations have gone no where…. They all basically consist of us arguing over matcha and coffee (Charles is a coffee fanatic and I can’t stand it. And vise versa with matcha) and while that is fun and talking to him makes me smile I feel like after weeks of talking I still barely know anything about him. I don’t even know his birthday! Except I am genuinely interested in him! I wanna see where things go.. but I don’t wanna just bombard Charles with questions abt himself.. I’ve never really been good with small talk unless I’m at church lol. I don’t want things to just end here but we are both awkward people and I feel a lil needy starting conversations and bugging with questions. This would also be his first relationship, he’s told me he’s always put school and sports first because there was never anyone he was too interested in so I wonder if the slow process is just because of that? Or am I being too impatient? What do I do now? ",1,1746504548.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

**RECAP**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/WuHcrAG5Ry): **September 13, 2024**

I'm honestly a mess and I don't know what to do, so any advice would be appreciated.

I (27m) and my husband (37m) have been married for 3 years, dating for six. He has an ex-wife (37f) which he divorced a year before we met. We have a son (7m) who was adopted after we got married and who I love as my own child, because he is.

I know my husband, Peter (fake name) is bisexual, I have no problem with it and I had no problem with his ex-wife, Allison (also fake name), I did have a problem with his family as they're a bit homophobic and are always telling Peter he should get back together with Allison. Well, two weeks ago, we were at his family's town because it was my son, Jack's (fake name) birthday and we wanted to spend it as family. My mother in law, decided it would be a good a idea to invite Allison so she arrived in the middle of the party, I didn't want to ruin Jack's birthday so I stayed quiet. I spent all my time with Jack, playing with him and his cousins at his request.

When it was time to cut the cake, I noticed Allison and Peter weren't there, so I went inside and looked for them around the house. I found them in Peter's old bedroom taking their clothes off. I stood there in shock for a moment but then I left and went back to celebrating Jack's birthday. Part of me wanted to scream and cry but I also was in shock and I refused to make Jack's birthday about me. We cut the cake and opened the presents, people were already leaving when Allison and Peter came back. Peter took me aside and started saying that I shouldn't have cut the cake without him present and it was disrespectful. I stared at him and just said ""I'm sorry, I just thought you'd be too busy getting into your ex-wife's pants"".

He got quiet so I took Jack and left the house to go back to the hotel. Once I put Jack in bed and made sure he was asleep, I locked myself in the bathroom and broke down. I called a friend and he tried his best to console me. I only calmed down in the morning when I took Jack for breakfast because I didn't want him to see me like that. I'm now watching him play in the park and I don't want him to suffer, I don't want him to have a broken family, I don't want him to know that relationships aren't a happy ever after. Peter has been calling and texting, apologizing for everything and I'm tempted to forgive him, I'm tempted to just have my family back, and all my friends are saying that it wad just a mistake, that he was vulnerable and Allison is his ex wife. So what am I supposed to do now? I need the advice from people who don't know my husband or me personally.

Please, any advice is helpful.

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was voted NTA**

**Relevant Comments** 

**Commenter 1:** Teach your son that his future partners has to respect him and their relationship by not being a cheating bastard.

> **OOP:** I do want to teach him this stuff but he's too young and I'm just scared that he'll get a bad view of relationships if he sees his parents divorce.

**OOP on collecting evidence on his husband’s cheating and if the husband has done this before** 

> **OOP:** From what I've been able to gather from the messages and calls, it has happened twice, including the time that I caught them. I hadn't thought about STIs, so thank you, I'll get tested.

**OOP responds to multiple comments about his husband not respecting him and the cheating wasn’t the first time**
 
> **OOP:** It's not, I found out it's the second time, but I don't want my son to know what happened. He's unaware and happy thinking his dads will be together forever. I don't want to break that illusion.

**Why didn’t OOP interrupt his husband’s cheating with the ex**

> **OOP:** I was really too shocked and hurt by what I saw that I just stood there without them noticing me, I them heard my son and unconsciously focused on him and only him. A copying mechanism maybe? I don't know, I was mostly in autopilot.

**Commenter:** NTA but you should leave.

I know it won't be easy, but if you stay, think of it as showing Jack that it's okay for your husband or wife to treat you badly. If you want him to know about happily ever after, you need to show him that it's okay to not settle and you work hard for your goals no matter what they are, and work towards them with kindness, honesty, and integrity. Kids are far more impressionable than we give credit for, and as someone who has known so many families where the person being hurt hasn't walked away, that hurt spreads until it damages everyone.

Relating to just yourself here there is a huge safety factor. Regardless of the sex of each individual involved, staying with a cheater also puts you in danger because you don't know everyone they're sleeping with and, more importantly, what STIs they can be carrying. So think about your son, and your health, and leave. Emotionally, if you're surrounded by people telling you to forgive and forget, those people are not safe to be around as you have no clue if they've been hiding this from you for a while either.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/klewnQc4jQ): **September 14, 2024 (next day)**

Well, first of all, I want to thank you all for your advice and I want to explain some things before the actual update. But thank you for opening my eyes about my situation.

1. Peter and Allison didn't notice me when I saw them. There was music very loud downstairs and they weren't facing the door.

2. I didn't stop them because I was in shock, I just stood there for a moment and I heard my son so I unconsciously focused on him. I was pretty much in autopilot.

3. Peter didn't come to the hotel with me because I changed to a different one, he did try to follow me but I took a taxi and left. As far as I know, he's staying with his parents and Allison left.

4. We met when I was 20 and he was 30, we started as friends, and we ended up dating. Yes, we're both men and no, I didn't feel manipulated or groomed by him.

Those were the most asked things and I did answer some comments, not all. Now onto the update.

I did as some of you said and took some tests to discard any STIs or STDs, the results are coming back in a few days, and I will take another one in three weeks to be sure. My son is having a sleepover with a friend and I decided to speak with my husband.

He came by our house after a few minutes I texted him, he asked about Jack and I told him where he was, then we sat on the couch and started talking. I started crying after a few minutes and he followed after. I asked some simple questions ""When? Why? How many times?"" Among others, and this is what I could figure out by all the things he said: It happened for the first time when he visited his parents alone two years ago, they invited her, they both got drunk, he was feeling lonely as I had been more attention to Jack since we adopted him, and they slept together. Nothing happened again until our sons birthday party, he said his mother pressured him a bit and he caved in. I don't believe he did it for that reason but I don't know. He said he doesn't love her and I believe him but it doesn't negate the fact of what he did.

After talking for a while, I told him that I wanted a divorce. He started sobbing and begging for another chance but I told him that I can't give him another chance because I wouldn't be able to trust him again and I don't want that in a relationship. He kept crying and begging for another thirty minutes until I told him that we have to think about Jack and his well being, that we could stay friends ds and coparent him. He got mad, really mad. He started yelling that it was all Jack's fault, that we shouldn't have adopted him, that he's the one who's getting between us. I was crying and really scared, I had never seen him this angry. He hit the table and stormed out of the house.

I called the house where Jack is staying at and told them if Peter shows up there, they can't open the door. After the little episode, I was scared that Peter would try to hurt Jack. I called my friend again, Thomas, and told him everything that happened. He came by and is staying with me until I'm better. Right now, I'm trying to figure out what to do and how to go on with the divorce.

**Comments**

**Commenter:** You are absolutely not wrong for not forgiving your husband. His reaction to the news of divorce, blaming your adopted son, is alarming and shows his true colors. Stay strong and prioritize your and Jack's safety.

**Commenter 2:** Sorry you are going through this. On the bright side, it seems that you will have no problem getting a full custody. It is better to have one loving parent, than two co-parents, where one is resenting you for mere existence.

**Commenter 3:** I can’t believe that he is taking no accountability for his actions and blaming your completely innocent son!! Every time you start missing your soon to be ex I want you to please remember what he said about your son.. it will be painful but it will strengthen your heart and mind to move on from that toxic man… you are definitely not the AH… keep striving for a healthy happy new relationship for you and your son..

[Update #2](https://new.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fp15ug/2_update/): **September 25, 2024 (11 days later)**

Hi again. Sorry for taking so long to update but it's been a chaotic week and I'm pretty shaken up but I'll try to summarize it.

My husband has been showing up at my work, following me, and calling me from burner phones. I was afraid he'd go after Jack like many of you said he would, but he didn't. He said a lot of stuff but I'll try to write the important things.

He said that he missed when we were just us, that I stopped paying attention to him when we adopted that Jack, that I wasn't his, anymore. He said that he missed how dependent I was on him, I was very insecure when we met but I started working on my issues when we adopted Jack because I didn't want to be a bad example for him. When we got married, I used to get sick all the time, I was weak and tired, so he would take care of me 24/7. The doctors couldn't tell what was wrong with me and I didn't get better until a bit after we adopted Jack. I guess that dependence it's what he missed?

Yesterday, he followed me to work and started screaming that I was his and that we made vows to stay together, we had to call security and he waited for me next to my car. I panicked and took a taxi home.

He keeps messaging me and showing up to our house, I took a few weeks off work to be with Jack although he's taking this better than me. I made an appointment with a therapist for him and when the divorce is finalized, I'll go to one myself.

I've been debating what to do, so I'll update when something happens.

**Comments**

**Commenter:** It's good that you’re prioritizing Jack and your own mental health by seeing a therapist. You deserve to feel safe and supported! It’s wild how some people can’t handle change, right? Your husband seems to be stuck in the past, and it’s not fair to you or Jack. Just remember, you’re doing what’s best for both of u, and that’s what truly matters.

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/nkLmaQS4br): **November 5, 2024 (1.5 months later)**

Hi guys, this is the final update for anyone who is interested, I'm only doing this update to give it some closure and because some people messaged me to ask for it. So here it is.

This has been a really difficult time but I'm almost divorced, I have primary custody of Jack, and I've got a restriction order against Peter and Allison. I'll try to be quick but a lot happened.

So, after I made the post, Peter kept calling and stalking me, I didn't know what to do until I started packing Peter's stuff and I found a box of pictures of me before we met, like three or four years before we met, while he was still married to Allison. I never knew why they got divorced, he just said it was too painful to talk about so I never asked, but I swallowed my anger and sent Allison a message to ask her about the pictures and she told me that they got divorced because she saw him stalking my Facebook several times and found the same box I did. He called it an innocent crush and curiosity but she thought he was cheating on her and they got divorced, a year later, he met me, but Allison always thought that I was the side piece.

I read a few comments saying that I maybe was sick because he was making me sick, I don't know if that's possible, I don't really know. I mean, the illness were bad enough to make me stay in bed, like having a bad cold, but I don't know, I stopped digging. After I found the pictures, I confronted Peter without Jack in the house and he seemed, I don't know, proud? He kept smiling and saying that all he did was for us, that it was love at first sight, and we were destined, he was just making sure it happened. Apparently, we had met before we became friends, I remember meeting him at a party through some friends but we met before, as teenagers. He and I lived in close by towns and my school made some trips to the towns nearby and we met on one of those trips. We were something like friends but only for a summer because he went to college and I soon forgot about him, but he found my Facebook, and the story continued. I was horrified, to say the least, he tried to console me and tell me that it was fine, that he did it out of love, and that if only we hadn't adopted Jack, everything would be fine.

I was bawling my eyes out, my entire marriage was a lie. He said that he only slept with Allison because he knew that it would get my attention and that we didn't have to go through with the divorce, that I know he loves me and that's it. He promised to be a better dad for Jack if I made more time for him. He told me to quit my job because he earned enough to take care of all of us and that would give me more time with him. I was in shock and then he hugged, calming me down. I admit that for a moment, I allowed him to hold me, I allowed myself to consider his proposal, but I kept thinking about his lies, it wasn't about the cheating, it was the stalking, the lies, the obsession, it creeped me out so I tried to pull away and tell him I'd go through with the divorce. He refused, he hugged me tighter and screamed that I needed him, that he could protect me, he could take care of me, he could save me, that I was his husband and only his. I was terrified, I slapped him and pulled away, yelling at him to get out of my house. He didn't. He just kept screaming and holding onto me until a neighbor heard the commotion and called the police. I filed a restriction order and been taking care of Jack since.

During the divorce proceedings, Peter asked for 50-50 custody, which surprised me because in all this time, he hasn't cared about seeing Jack, but I later found out that it was only because he would get to see me and talk to me regularly. He's been contesting every single thing about the divorce, trying to make it last longer than it has, and it's been working. He offered to give me child support even though we have 50-50 custody, he allowed me to keep the house, and other stuff.

So, that's what's been going on in my life, the only happy thing that happened was Halloween, Jack insisted on dressing up as Spiderman and me dressing up as Tony Stark so we did and I took him Trick or Treating, it was the most adorable sight ever and I knew I made the right choice with him and Peter.

I'm sorry for such a long post but this will probably be the last update, thank you so much for the advice and for hearing me rant.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** How did you meet on a school trip as teenagers when your husband is ten years older than you? If it was the summer before he left for college, weren't you 8 years old?

> **OOP:** No, he was already in college, he just left again. He was spending the summer at his hometown, sorry for not explaining better.

**OOP clarifies on the timeline on how and when he met his ex due to their age gaps**

> **OOP:** He had pictures from before I thought we met when I was 20. And he was already in college, he was just spending the summer in his hometown, we met in the summer when I was ablut fourteen. I'm sorry for the messy writing, English isn't my first language.

[Update #4](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/yVb3s3XIhK): **April 20, 2025 (5.5 months later)**

I know I said that my last update would be the final but I'm so very confused right now.

So, we're finishing with the divorce proceedings but Peter's attitude has given a 180° and I don't know if I'm crazy or what. The last time I posted here, Peter was basically saying that our son was the reason for our divorce and only wanted custody of him to see me. We'll, now he's being father of the year. A friend of mine, Dean (fake name) is handling the drops and pick ups of Jack so that I don't see Peter, at first he was mad and called me because he thought he and I were dating, then he didn't care.

Now, I thought that he would treat Jack badly and I kept a very close on him, asked him questions about his father, how everything was going, etc. Jack told me that he's been acting like the perfect Dad, he's nice, he plays with him, helps him, and is completely different from before. I have talked to Peter and he told me he was going to therapy, which I'm happy for, and he has messaged me, apologized, and told me that we should try couples therapy. I declined and he hasn't asked again but he wants us to meet up at his house tomorrow to discuss everything that happened, he said it was part of his therapy.

I haven't gone to therapy, I can't afford it right now, but Jack is. I can't say I don't miss Peter because he was a great partner and husband before everything went down, but I don't trust him after all that happened. So, I don't know what to say to him tomorrow or how to express how I feel about it.

Is it wrong to miss him? I mean, this whole thing happened because he slept with someone else and I know that he hasn't seen Allison and won't be seeing her again because she's also done. Should I just move past it? Jack is also saying that he misses the three of us together, he's cried to me about it more times than I can count and asks why I can't forgive his dad. What the hell am I supposed to do? To feel?

It's a short update. I guess that I'm just trying to vent without judgement from the people I know and give an update to those who asked it. Thanks again for all the support I received in my other posts.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It’s love bombing. He knows your child is your priority and so that’s what he’s targeting. My ex cheated and was a diagnosed sociopath/sex addict. To “prove he’d changed” he joined sex addicts anon to show he had changed. Even sent me a photo of his one month chip. I told him I’d never take him back regardless. So he never went back again, and told me that he’d wished he’d given me an std (I was pregnant) so that I’d have a “effed up kid” so that no one would ever want me… Love bombing isn’t sending gifts, it’s knowing so Done so well that you can target them to get what you want..

**Commenter 2:** I would be very careful right now, he’s acting like father of the year which is out of character for him. He knows what you value and it’s Jack. So he’s doing everything to win you back by being the best Dad to Jack. He even has Jack asking you why you can’t forgive his father. I would be wary that he’s coaching Jack in small ways to try to win you back. This is either genuine or a master plan. The way he acted before about you being his makes me think it may not be genuine. I would stay the line you’re currently in and just monitor the situation because the last thing you want to do is cave only to realize it was all fake. He even told you before that he cheated because you were not paying enough attention to him so what happens if he feels like that again? Green light for him to sleep with someone else? I wish you all the best. Updateme

**Commenter 3:** PLEASE DONT GO BACK. You were scared. He followed you. You feared what he would do to your CHILD.

You feared your safety. My ex did alot of the same stuff and it’s been 10 years and he didn’t get better. And no. Not the cheating. The obsession. The creepy. Once I was gone for over a year, more and more kept happening. Or becoming clearer. How old were you when you “first met” or in the photos ? Because that’s insane.

#----NEW UPDATE----

[Update #5](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/XNz6oCHCP9): **April 29, 2025 (nine days later)** 

Okay, I'm going to clear up a few things before I give you the actual update, I don't answer comments, I prefer to answer every question here instead of answering the same question separately.

1 - I should've explained ir better but my restriction order was a temporal one, only for 30 days. 

2 - Peter was a very good husband. I read that he was abusive all throughout our relationship, he wasn't. And he was a good dad to Jack. Everything went to hell when I caught him cheating. 

3 - What Jack was saying wasn't told by Peter, I talked to him and I made sure, he just has been missing our life before. 

4 - Peter would NEVER touch Jack like some of you suggested. My case may make it seem like he could, but he never even touched me or groomed me. I did talk to Jack, just to make sure, and he reassured me nothing happened.

Now, onto the update. I did meet with Peter, most of you told me not to go to his apartment so I told him to meet at a park, take a walk, or something. When I saw him, he was different. He looked very depressed and he hugged me when he saw me. He wouldn't stop apologizing for what happened.

We started talking and walking, he didn't justify what he said or did, but he did say he regrets it. He said that he misses me and misses being together. I asked about Allison and he told me that he cut her and his parents out, which I believe he did, and then I asked about what he said about Jack. He basically said that he resented Jack for a long time because my attention wasn't on him anymore, and it was selfish, but he was too used to be the center of my world so when it suddenly changed, he couldn't take it. He told me he loves Jack but that he sustains that if giving him up meant to have me back, he would do it in a heartbeat.

We talked for hours while Jack was with my friend, I cried a lot, there were things I decided not to ask like if he was drugging me like some of you said, because I honestly don't want to know. We have been texting these past days, mostly about Jack, but I'm considering family therapy, mostly to help Jack cope with everything. The divorce is still happening which Peter wasn't too happy about but he wasn't angry anymore, just sad.

I also recently met a guy in a coffee shop and we have been texting a lot so I'll see how that turns out. And that's it for the moment, I'll update you guys if you have many questions or if something else happens.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** You dating someone else is going to show you who Peter REALLY is because you still refuse to believe it

**Commenter 2:** Yeah I really don’t want to be the one to say this cause your life is your life but I genuinely think you should hold off any dating whatsoever.

Was he a good partner and father before? No not really, because all of that is TAINTED sand irrevocably changed because he’s been playing behind the scenes to make you his. You’re relationship wasn’t a natural process of knowing each other and falling in love, it’s been him STALKING you for years and threw away his previous relationship to manipulate a friendship then a romance WITH YOU.

Like really think about it; Your ex husband played puppet master the entire time you’ve known him, every meaningful moment was/highly likely to have been orchestrated BY HIM without you knowing that, how he wants to give up the SON you guys adopted!!!He blames your son for the relationship failing and tried to convince you to give him up!!

I remember that one update you did where he told you he’d take care of you and give you everything so you can stop working and be home with him. If you were a woman there would’ve been a ‘bare foot and pregnant’ added to that!!!

This man is obsessed with you, wants you with him always, and still blames your son for “taking your attention” and probably would give him up if given the chance, and you think dating is still doable?

PLEASE think about not starting anything with anyone because if your ex has gone to these lengths, I guarantee you getting a boyfriend will push him to further. If your son was in this relationship with someone who acted and did the same things as your ex, what would you tell him?

Please be safe dude!!

**Commenter 3:** So men also manipulate other men when they are in a relationship, so it isn’t just us women who “fall” for it. Cause my guy you have and still is, which is very concerning for you, not to mention Jack cause the second Peter get a whiff about you dating someone? Phew… my advice is hold of on dating and get a therapist, cause clearly you are not that good at seeing red flags and could end up in a situation/relationship just as toxic as this one. Which sadly is the most common for people coming out of a toxic relationship, you go back to what you know sort of ordeal. Have one friend that does, and still is surprised when crap hits the wall no matter how many times you point out the SAME red flags with a banner in the sky. You just have a kid in the mix. Best of luck, OP.

I’m 26 years old (she/they) from Southern California with a full-time job, so my schedule and posting are varied. I’m huge into doing OOC content like playlist, memes or even reference photos, and I do so even when I’m unable to write replies. I prefer long term stories where we can really work and dissect characters, worlds and more! My terms are still the same; **3rd person over Discord**, I don’t do **OC x Canon or crossover content**, I do offer some original stuff stuff depending, and I ask that you be 18+ when reaching out to me.

Onto the series!

**Yellowjackets** - Lottie, Shauna, Van, Natalie, Melissa, I would love to take a swing at writing for any of them, and I prefer the pre-rescue versions, or even something prior to the crash if it’s your cup of tea.

**Overwatch** - I can pick up a variety of characters, and I love doing AU’s for this. I’m very drawn to playing Mercy, D.VA, Ana, Lucio, Baptiste, Ashe, Cassidy and potentially Widowmaker, Sombra and Sigma as well. 

**Apex Legends** - I would love to get a chance to write for Horizon, Lifeline or Wraith for this series. I had a Wattson run as well that I would love to return to, if given the chance. 

**Cobra Kai** -  Same as above, I haven’t written for anyone yet, but could try doing Miguel, Tori or Johnny to start. Maybe post series? An alt timeline where some characters didn’t get a happy ending? 

**Persona 5** - I’ve had great luck finding people to write with, but most are either on hiatus or have quietly stepped away for the time being. I love writing Akira, Ann, Yusuke and I’ve slowly began writing for Makoto.

**Invincible** - Currently caught up with the series, have not gotten to the comics just yet. I can try my hand at Mark, Eve, Cecil, Rae and potentially Rex as well. 

**Homestuck** - I’m very far behind on the newest series, but if you’d like to try something out from the old chapters, I’m really familiar with characters, and I love playing multiples at one! I would heavily prefer AU’s for this. I’m familiar with most of the gals, but I can also try a few of the guys too. 

**Wrestling/WWE** - This one is a little more complicated, as I would love to do something specially about the characters in kayfabe. Interview stuff is totally fine, but I don’t want to bring up actual names or people. I am most interested in playing Rhea Ripley across from either a Dominick or Liv.

**Resident Evil** - I love AU’s or SOL settings! Two in particular are very corny, but I would love to do a sort of “date with the presidents daughter”, with a bit of Ashley and Leon post mission being cute together, or maybe a snowy town mystery with a reunion of Billy and Rebecca. I’m pretty open when it comes to ideas. 

The miscellaneous tracks are: **Monster High**, **Kingdom Hearts**, **Disney/Dreamlight Valley style**, **School Spirits**, **The Last of Us**, **Fallout TV show**, **The Bear**, **Fullmetal Alchemist**, **DC/MCU** ( especially animated series like Creature Commandos, Harley Quinn show and the early Titans series, as well as Wandavision, and Agatha All Along) and I would love to try **SpyxFamily**, though I’m very behind on it.

I love doing stories involving **horror** and **romance** especially, however I’m not opposed to **SOL** or **mystery**. I don’t often do stories that align with canon since I heavily prefer AU’s. I have previous ideas from my older post that I would still love to adapt as well.

Specifically, I love things set in **Zombie/Fallout/Apocalypse** style worlds, **Hunger Games/Squid Games/Battle Royales** where we can dive into characters in brutal fights, **spies in a futuristic world or period pieces set in western, 50’s-90’s** and **simple Coffee shop/Bakery/Perfect street** settings where we can let characters have fun and be a little more safe. I also love stuff set in **old school Hollywood and Las Vegas.**

My last request is that you reach out to me with a general idea of what you’d like to do before moving over to Discord. I don’t open nor respond to “hey wanna write” or “let’s RP” messages, as I find them to often lead nowhere. I don’t mind returning partners, however, I don’t like being dropped randomly after a week of planning, OOC chats and excitement. Just let me know you’d like to step out and I’ll be totally content with it.

If you’re at all interested, please feel free to DM me with the word **FIREFLY** so I know you’ve read through everything seen here. 

Thank you for checking out my post, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!

John Oliver is rebranding Minor League Baseball teams on Last Week Tonight. No input from the teams. No guidelines. Just pure, glorious unpredictability. It’s a chance to get our city nationally known in a way that’s unique and fun.

Now, let’s be real—Greenville has more hot dog stands than we have coffee shops, and that’s no accident. We’re the perfect candidate for something bold and quirky. Maybe we’ll get rebranded as the “Greenville Chili Slawdogs.” Or maybe it’ll be something totally unexpected—that’s the beauty of it!

But here’s the thing—the Drive needs to reach out to John Oliver’s team first.
Email: johnoliver@buntstuff.com

We have a chance to make Greenville the next big thing in the Minor League world. Imagine our city becoming a tourist attraction for fans who want to experience the weirdest, coolest rebrand in all of baseball.

Everyone else: Let’s show the Drive how much we want this!
Email the team at info@greenvilledrive.com and let them know: Greenville is ready to shine on a national stage.

After 3 weeks of eating and drinking my way through Spain and Portugal, I started back on 4/22, the day after my vacation. Light resistance training only, and no free meals the first two weeks. One free meal per week for the last four weeks depending on progress.

Goal is around 110 g protein a day. I'm using Fullerton Nutrition Salted Caramel meal replacement as my morning meal and late afternoon snack replacement (one scoop/half a serving is 200 calories, 25 g protein, 11 g fat, 0.5 g carbs, 0.5 g sugar). I have it with black coffee in the morning and blend it with ice and water in the late afternoon.

For lunch and dinner, I have boneless skinless grilled chicken over a greek salad or with broccoli/cauliflower.

For dinner, more grilled chicken and broccoli/cauliflower or greek salad, + 3 liters of water, multivitamin and supplements daily.

I usually end up around 800 calories and 110 g protein.

The first week was definitely water weight aka wine, but I am very pleased to see the weight loss continue so far in Week 2.

We met 2019 pero nung 2020 (pandemic era) nag stay na ako sa bahay nila for good dahil sya lang and younger brother nasa philippines sa family nya. Lahat nasa US na.

Moving forward yung brother nya is nasa Bulacan na nag stay, sa girlfriend nya din. Basically sya yung parang kakampi ko din kasi parehas kami ng mga reklamo sa bahay haha.

So 2 years ago nai pasok ko sa work yung girlfriend ko and need mag training for 3 weeks walang uwian. So ang ginawa ng mother nya na nasa US is pinapunta dito sa bahay yung tito nya and yung anak ng tito nya. Okay naman sila kasama sa bahay nung una pero natapos yung 3 weeks hindi na sila umalis, maganda kasi location ng bahay, magandang village and bawal ang trycicle sa loob so tahimik talaga. From tarlac naka tira yung tito nga nagkataon nagka problema sila don nung anak nya kaya napadpad dito sa manila. Yung other relatives naman nila nasa san mateo.

So until now andito pa rin yung tito nya, pabor naman sa GF ko kasi may nag aalaga ng aso namin may nagluluto at mabait naman talaga. Ang problema, una sa lahat syempre nasanay kaming dalawa lang na nasa bahay na mimiss ko yung privacy. Pangalawa, parang naging entitled wala naman syang inaambag, binabayaran pa nga sya sa pag stay. One time nag sabi kami na mag grocery, ang sabi ba naman sakin “bili ka nga ng ano creamer!” Parang iritable na way. Yung CR din namin halos dalawang hakbang lang sa ginagamit nyang kwarto, dun pa umiihi pag gabi sa loob ng kwarto nya gamit ang naubos na lalagyanan ng coffee mate. Tapos sa labas ng bahay umiihi din sya. Sobrang panghi ng paligid!

Mahilig din sya magluto ng isda na hindi ko alam kung anong klase. (Sorry po, sobrang selan kasi ng pang amoy ko) yung tipong isang linggo bago mawala ang lansa ng bahay.

Mabait sya pero may mga kwento sya na naiiba sa mata ng mga nasa US na relatives. Nag bibida bida sya. Iniisip ko baka lagi kasi ako nabibigyan ng kung ano ano e hindi ko naman hinihingi yun sa family ng gf ko at sila mismo nag bibigay tinatanggihan ko na nga din.

Siniraan nya na din ako sa mga anak nya like hindi daw ako bumabati sa kanya. Nagtataka ako kasi panong hindi ko sya babatiin or kakausapin e magkasama naman kami lagi sa bahay. Binago ko yung treatment, lagi ko na sya binabati kahit nonsense.

Sobrang tight ng family nila like kahit mga malalayong pinsan, ang treatment is parang first or main family, sobrang daming redflags kasi sila GF ang may kaya sa buong family nila kaya yung ibang relatives parang laging may opinion regarding sa akin. Hindi naman sa pag yayabang pero maganda naman ang trabaho ko at ang pamilya ko ay kaya din naman makipag sabayan sa family nila in terms of money.

Gusto ko nalang umuwi samin, pero hindi ko maiwan GF ko dahil magiging dalawa nalang sila sa bahay and nasanay na syang magkasama kami palagi. Hindi ko din naman maaya bumukod dahil una sa lahat bahay nya yung tinitirahan namin.

Masarap mamuhay ng walang ibang iniintindi or kasama sa bahay at yung privacy din namin as mag partner pero pano nga ba namin magagawa?

The conversation was nice. She was laughing a lot so I thought she enjoyed my company. We are too much into similar stuff so I thought it was a good thing.

Conversation never evolved into what the expectations were. When the time was up, she left without saying if she wanted to meet again or not. I asked and she said yeah ok but I know that yeah ok. Moments later she blocked me on telegram. This person is a bit older than me and I would have expected her to tell to my face that she is not attracted, or whatever the problem was.

I can think of 2 things: I sent her a selfie from last year, and my accent.

It just also gets so much worse with anxiety like starting a new job. Maybe part of it is me changing my diet right before I start because I’m like oh I need more fruits, vegetables, protein bars, psyllium husk, etc. Now, I’m going to stop eating protein bars and drinking oat milk which I started a few days ago  with coffee bc I needed it for constipation lol. 


Maybe it’s just if I was mostly at home or in more comfortable situations, then I wouldn’t notice the symptoms as much. But genuinely, it’s like suddenly I start getting leaky gas, constipation, gassier, and smellier once I started working at an actual place again. And then I become so focused on trying not to smell and start noticing leaky gas and stuff. 


I also have the feeling of constantly needing to poop/fart in public even if I really don’t which I’ve read is an anxiety thing. I’ll be at a movie theater and the whole time my mind is basically just focused on needing to go to the bathroom which I literally can’t even do in public areas because of anxiety. 


I am on Spironolactone which when I’m not working and stressed it doesn’t really cause those issues, so I assume it’s not that. And I work night shift which might be affecting it too. It could also be from adjusting from being sedentary a lot of the time to on my feet for 10 hours. 


Basically, there is just so many things that it could be that I don’t know what to do. This has happened twice of trying to work at Amazon almost a year apart and then suddenly getting all of these same symptoms . I did alter my diet and lifestyle the first time too. 


I just don’t know what to do. Has anyone had any success with SSRI’s or other mental health meds? Lexapro wasn’t the best for me but maybe Zoloft or Prozac. And have you guys experienced any of these symptoms happening because of anxiety and the other things I’ve done?

I noticed she was facing away from the seats, gripping on the handle and her cups, and consistently spitting into them. I tried to ignore it. But after a few stops she splashed the saliva contents of her cup onto the wall in front of her, right behind the driver’s door. Extremely random, she didn’t even say a word and just plastered it on the wall. Everyone was shocked and confused. I locked eyes with another woman who was freaked out about the encounter and we got up from our seats and sat somewhere else. It seems stupid and ignorable, but it genuinely shook me up because I have really bad health anxiety. 

I actually briefly remember her on the bourke street trams as well but I had not encountered her doing anything like this before.

This is kinda a follow up to previous post. Basically I’m a 27M guy in the “talking stage” of the AM process, but I am navigating some difficulties since I’m not sure of much and I was born and raised here in America. It’s not letting me link the post here, but please check my profile for context if y’all wish, but a quick summary is that I wasn’t sure if she really wanted a marriage since she said yes to engagement since I met a “checklist” and that “there wasn’t a reason to say no” rather than something specific about me. Based on the comments I suggested to my folks that her family visit them and I’ll meet them and show them around where my parents live, and drive up to where I live and show them around here too. And maybe I can take a quick side step with her and discuss alone if she’s truly okay with the marriage. 

I’ve met her at her uncles place in Dubai when I was there a month ago for a quick one day visit and I had to come back for work. 

So, long story short, they agreed to come here, in a week or two. I was just wondering what do I do? Is there a polite way I can suggest we take a quick detour just the, two of us, for a one on one conversation? If so what should be the setting for this talk? She showed interest in my hobbies, so I was thinking about, when they visit the city where I live, me and her could go to the gun range real quick so I can do my part of showing her something cool, and then we could go to a coffee shop or something to talk about specifics. Or maybe the reverse order? Cuz just side stepping for a difficult convo on its own seems heavy and rude but idk. 

Either way, the last time I met her at her uncles place in Dubai, both our families were there and she said yes to engagement. But like I’m not sure what to do here. What’s the etiquette? What would be the proper way to have this talk? 

Also, she said she would move here if we got married. Is there anything else I should show her here, about living over here, so that she has the full idea? I was just gonna show her my house with my roommate, and then possible apartments I would get if we get married so we could have our own place, and just the general city. This way she can also provide some input and I would have enough time to make changes and see what can be done to fit her needs before she comes over here post-marriage. That is if we do end up getting married, ofc. But I just want enough time to prep and make sure I can consider her needs and input, so this is a bit preemptive, I get it. 

Idk man, I feel like I’m overthinking this and I’m not sure what to do. I just don’t want there to be any “oh man you didn’t tell my about xyz” moments so I just want to be able to 1) have the talk with her about if she really wants this and 2) if she says yes and I’m convinced she’s truly okay, I wanna give her the best idea of life over here so she can decide if she truly wants this. Cuz I posted here last time and y’all made the great point of me assuming she would adjust here, and I probably shouldn’t assume that.  

I know I rambled a bit, sorry for the long post. I didn’t expect them to visit this soon, since I thought it would take some time to get a visa, but turns out they already had a 10 year multiple entry visa from a previous trip, so they can come soon, so I feel like I got less time to prepare haha. But any advice from y’all is appreciated. Thank you. ",4,1746502260.0,AskIndianWomen,3,0.7,False

This is kinda a follow up to previous post. Basically I’m a 27M guy in the “talking stage” of the AM process, but I am navigating some difficulties since I’m not sure of much and I was born and raised here in America. It’s not letting me link the post here, but please check my profile for context if y’all wish, but a quick summary is that I wasn’t sure if she really wanted a marriage, and based on the comments I suggested to my folks that her family visit them and I’ll meet them and show them around where my parents live, and drive up to where I live and show them around here too. And maybe I can take a quick side step with her and discuss alone if she’s truly okay with the marriage. 

I’ve met her at her uncles place in Dubai when I was there a month ago for a quick one day visit and I had to come back for work. 

So, long story short, they agreed to come here, in a week or two. I was just wondering what do I do? Is there a polite way I can suggest we take a quick detour just the, two of us, for a one on one conversation? If so what should be the setting for this talk? She showed interest in my hobbies, so I was thinking about, when they visit the city where I live, me and her could go to the gun range real quick so I can do my part of showing her something cool, and then we could go to a coffee shop or something to talk about specifics. Or maybe the reverse order? 

Either way, the last time I met her at her uncles place in Dubai, both our families were there and she said yes to engagement. But like I’m not sure what to do here. What’s the etiquette? What would be the proper way to have this talk? 

Also, she said she would move here if we got married. Is there anything else I should show her here, about living over here, so that she has the full idea? I was just gonna show her my house with my roommate, and then possible apartments I would get if we get married so we could have our own place, and just the general city. 

Idk man, I feel like I’m overthinking this and I’m not sure what to do. I just don’t want there to be any “oh man you didn’t tell my about xyz” moments so I just want to be able to 1) have the talk with her about if she really wants this and 2) if she says yes and I’m convinced she’s truly okay, I wanna give her the best idea of life over here so she can decide if she truly wants this.

# Why I Broke Up with New York

*Most people accept the city’s chaos as a toll for an expansive life. It took me several decades to realize that I could go my own* 

Icannot tell you the moment that New York began for me, only that I began in New York. There are stories from the months before I was born, when I was still nestled inside my mother like a Yonah Schimmel knish to go. In September, during her first trimester, the city was overtaken by a heat wave so mighty that it made being inside without A.C. unbearable—you had to stay moving just to create a breeze. My mom remembers thinking that New York hadn’t felt so unhinged since the Summer of Sam, that the heat lent an edge of hysteria to everyday interactions. Circling the block one day, she ran into an equally sweaty and disoriented friend on the corner of Broadway and Houston, who told her that the sculptor Carl Andre had been accused of throwing his wife, the seminal Cuban-born artist Ana Mendieta, out a window the previous night. Despite the temperature, my mother turned toward home.

I recall being told about another time, weeks before I was due, when my parents went to see a movie at Lincoln Plaza, and the smell of other people’s buttered popcorn made my mom so sick that she had to leave halfway through. Afterward, on the subway, my father—who has often been accused of charging ahead with little concern for those travelling with him—made a mad dash out of the train car just before the doors closed, leaving her behind. “I looked around and everyone was laughing,” she recalls. She laughed, too, just to seem like she was in on the joke. But then, as the train began to pull away, she placed her hand on the glass between her and my father and burst into tears. Come to think of it, neither of these is a very romantic story. They’re about the struggle of living in a city where, compressed like office workers in a stalled elevator, we are driven to a kind of madness.

I came home from the hospital to a loft on Broadway between Prince and Spring. At this point, my mother had already lived there for almost fifteen years. It was my first home, and in a way it had been hers, too. She moved in fresh out of art school, and had a landlord who was so hostile to his “bohemian” tenants that he often turned off the heat and water, so the building became a sort of glorified campground. It’s hard to convey, to those who know SoHo only in its current form, just how different it was to live there even by the late eighties. With wide, empty streets and garbage piling on the curbside, it lives in my memory as a gray industrial wasteland, evoking either “Gangs of New York” or “Blade Runner” depending on the time of day. A generation of artists had begun to populate the area, and many were revolting against the status quo and remaining childless by choice. The ones who became parents were still living in the aftershocks of [the case of Etan Patz](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505135204/https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/mistrial-in-the-etan-patz-case), a beautiful blond boy a few blocks over who had set off for the school bus one morning and never returned. Around that time, the local preschool playgroup began using a new contraption for walking toddlers to the park—a rope with a mitten attached for each child, forming a makeshift group leash.

It didn’t take long for me to grow into possibly the least adaptable native the city had ever seen. All good New Yorkers know that to live in, and love, the city takes a certain amount of chutzpah—you have to be ready, at a moment’s notice, to push your way through the throngs, shout your coffee order, rush to nab the last subway seat or the only on-duty cab. You have to be unsurprised by the consistent surprises that come with a new day in New Amsterdam. And you have to love it all, even if you pretend you don’t. My parents had both been raised far enough outside the city to have childhoods that could be called idyllic, but close enough that Manhattan exerted a strong pull. Getting to New York was their ultimate expression of self-determination, the place where they would shed preconceptions about who they were meant to be and create a new life among artists and experimental thinkers, planting their seeds in the fecund soil of the city. If we are to continue with the plant metaphor, I was more like an avocado pit mashed into a cup of dirt by an excited third grader who then forgot to water it. I never actually sprouted.

As devout citizens of their adopted city, my parents ought to have been ashamed of the creature they’d wrought. First, I hated the subway—the noise, the smells, the fact that any route you planned would, the next day, inevitably be littered with fresh obstacles. In the third grade, my best friend, Isabel—a brave, scrappy child whose natural independence I envied—was riding in a subway car when a bomb went off. She described being rushed through the resulting mayhem by her grandmother, a glamorous woman with a bonnet of gold hair whom she called Dammy, as injured commuters lay all around them. Seemingly unfazed, Isabel was back on the 2/3 line within weeks, whereas I still stood at the mouth of the subway station, inconsolable, begging to turn back.

Navigating the city on foot was only marginally better. I hated the smell of rotting fish on Canal Street, where I’d bury my nose in my mother’s pants as we walked to Isabel’s house. I also hated Central Park—though we rarely went—because, during a class trip, I’d seen an ailing pigeon, laboring through its final breaths, sitting atop what looked to be a nest of its own intestines. I’d promptly thrown up in the bushes near Strawberry Fields. I liked the local park on Thompson and Spring, until one day I entered a plastic tube on the jungle gym to find a bald-headed man on his belly, reaching his arms out toward me. I hated St. Marks Place, because I had seen a handsome young guy asleep on a stoop with a needle in his neck, and I hated Sixteenth and Third—inconveniently, the block my school was on—because I had once passed a dapper elderly gentleman in a camel overcoat, who’d smiled warmly, then begun to twitch and let loose a sudden stream of shocking expletives, after which he smiled again and kept moving. I hated our front door, because, leaving for school one morning, we had found someone lowering his pants to defecate.

You may be sensing a theme. Every place where I had seen something or someone that provoked unease was deemed permanently suspect. And, if you couldn’t return to the scene of some randomized chaos in pre-Giuliani Manhattan, you couldn’t do much at all. For so many people, New York seems to open a portal to the expansive lives they had always felt they should be living. For me, the city constricted until the only place I felt safe was in my loft bed at the back of our apartment, my head in a book, the faint sounds of the streets below my window like a white-noise machine that occasionally yelled, “Out of my way, motherfucker!” Even at home, there were no guarantees. A few months after the defecation episode, my mother called the elevator, which opened directly into our living space, only to find a disoriented person wearing a tutu and smeared red lipstick advancing into our home. “I think you are in the wrong place,” my mom said calmly, again and again, her voice low and powerful, and the person eventually left without incident. But for months afterward I froze whenever I heard the elevator straining to lift off: I was in the wrong place, too.

All this may seem to imply some deeper judgment about the city—that I think it’s wanton and unregulated, a “Where’s Waldo?” of Boschian perversion. But I will always defend New York from those sorts of charges—after all, no one can talk shit about my mother but me. The issue isn’t that New Yorkers leer, jeer, curse, and shit in public. It’s that the city’s messy scrum was a poor fit for a chronically ill child with obsessive-compulsive tendencies and a preternatural inability to look both ways when crossing the street.

It took me years to understand that most people accept New York’s mayhem as some kind of toll, a small price to pay for the panoply of delights available to them at a moment’s notice—whoever said “Nothing good ever happens after midnight” has never lived in New York. But anyone who has ever fallen in love with the city knows that they will accept myriad slights just to stay in that relationship—cramped apartments, troublesome neighbors, two trains and a bus home, the night shift. How many Hollywood movie plots hinge roughly on the idea that the hero will do anything, anything at all, not to be shipped back to the suburbs? It was my parents, however, who had chosen that plot; I was simply the culmination of it.

My late grandmother—my primary confidant, whose house in rural Connecticut I considered to be the apex of peace—would sometimes shake her head and tell my parents to get me out of the city. “It’s no place for a child,” she would whisper to me when my parents left the room, noting my “terrible nerves.” But my father, *her* child, had felt the same way about his home town of Old Lyme, which was so insular that nearly every business in the nearby neighborhood of Hamburg was owned by a relative. Recently, we went back there to visit my grandmother’s grave on the twenty-fifth anniversary of her death. Buried there, too, are her aunts, whose names—Tess, Hazel, Ruth, Grace, Helen, Margaret—suggest a good Protestant stability. The longer we spent in the town, the more my father’s shoulders hunched, and he shuffled along like a little boy. “You can’t even imagine how small this place feels,” he told me. “There’s nowhere I can look without being faced with a memory.”

Somehow, it hadn’t occurred to him that I might have similarly complicated feelings about New York. I may not have come of age with a group of stiff Republican relatives whose offspring still own the local Subaru dealership, but growing up is one of a handful of things that everyone has to do. My father’s family was baffled that anyone would ever want to leave the bucolic world of Hamburg. Mine seemed to wonder who could ever see New York as anything other than the center of the universe.

I loved spending time at my grandma’s house because of the slow pace of her days. A trip to the grocery store to buy a half pound of London broil constituted a major outing. We sat side by side reading, opened the mail when it came, took a break at five o’clock for peanuts and tonic water, and I’d be safely tucked into bed by 8 *P.M.* In the city, by contrast, my mother could pack ten or eleven separate excursions into a single day—or, conversely, spend hours wandering the floors of the discount department store Century 21, striking up endless conversations in the communal dressing room (another place I regarded poorly, having seen one woman elbow another in the face over a cut-price Victoria’s Secret negligee). My mom and her sisters—Jewish girls at the opposite end of the spectrum from the Margarets, Hazels, and Tesses of the world—lived to move. I distinctly remember my mother repeating that “what I love about Manhattan is that if you really want to you can always get from one end to the other in twenty minutes.” (This is not, strictly speaking, true, and I blame the remark for my lifelong inability to properly judge commute times.)

My aunt Susan once said of my mother, “Laurie is a ‘from’ girl—the lox is from one place, the bagels from another, the flowers from someplace else.” Knowing how to get the best out of the city—from discount Manolos to vintage buttons to a ten-dollar blow-dry—gives my mother the satisfaction of a chess grand master stumping her opponent with a series of unexpected moves. But being a “from” girl is about more than the provenance of goods; it’s about living at such high speeds that your inner life can never quite catch up to you. In my mother’s New York, I couldn’t help but feel like a character in a children’s book where, say, a sloth must attend school with human kids, taking great pains to hide his true identity under glasses and a cardigan.

It was largely my discomfort with the world outside our door that sent me to therapy in fourth grade, and put me on anti-anxiety medication by middle school. I’d take a sneaky route to the psychiatrist lest my classmates put two and two together, but, even so, I became marked with the amorphous and dreaded designation “kid with issues.” I was sure there was an alternative reality in which I could be “normal,” some chosen realm in which I could shine. At that stage of life, my chosen realm was the world of “[Eloise](https://web.archive.org/web/20250505135204/https://www.amazon.com/dp/067122350X),” Kay Thompson’s iconic book about a six-year-old girl—a quixotic creation with unbrushed hair and a potbelly, a.k.a. my celebrity look-alike—who lives essentially unsupervised in the Plaza. On the book’s second page, Eloise declares, “I am a city child / I live at The Plaza.” But this city child never seems to set foot outside: everything and everyone she needs exists within the walls of the hotel, and she is its wayward princess.

After years of begging, I persuaded my father to bring me to the Plaza to experience it firsthand. It was my twelfth birthday, and I was roundly unpopular at school, so, as a stand-in for the slumber parties that other girls were having, the two of us spent the night in a twin room on a low floor. By then, the hotel had passed through the hands of Ivana Trump, who had done a grandiose renovation, and the space—drawn in the book with such vivid low-key glamour by Hilary Knight—was hard to recognize. I asked for Eloise’s usual meal of beef medallions, but it wasn’t on the menu, so we ate grilled cheese and watched “The Rainmaker” and I got a bloody nose.

In the months following 9/11, my parents briefly considered moving us out of New York. Like everyone during that endless “after,” they were stunned by the destruction and unsure of what could come next. We piled into the car and drove up to look at a rental house on a rural stretch of road in northwest Connecticut. My visit to Housatonic Valley Regional High School ended with a peek at the agricultural center, where I dreamed of bottle-feeding baby goats and winning trophies in animal husbandry. “I think we could have a wonderful life here,” I said again and again, with the energy of Annette Bening’s character in “American Beauty” chanting, “I will sell this house today!” But it was clear that, though my mother might be worried for her family, she could not be parted from her lover: New York. And, really, what was I expecting? This was the woman who had tried to pay extra to keep her 212 number when we moved to Brooklyn. “From” girl, indeed.

New York and I had a brief moment when it seemed like we might fall in love after all. Of course, it was when boys really entered the chat. I was back from college (in the cornfields of Ohio, which is a great place to send your kids if you want them to return with a fresh appreciation of what New York has to offer) and had only recently shed some of my fearfulness and begun dating in earnest. I found myself waiting in a bar on Ludlow in knee-high boots and red lipstick, excited to be crushingly disappointed; dancing to music by yet-to-be-cancelled men in basements in Chinatown; lying prone in a ransacked house share in Flatbush, shivering with anticipation (or maybe just shivering). I fell in lust at the edges of Park Slope, standing on the aboveground subway platform (much preferred to the other kind) in a dress that had seemed perfect the night before, but in the glaring sun made its absurdity apparent. I fell in love in Bemelmans Bar, at the Carlyle, and again on the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, and once more eating fried clams on City Island. I choked back unrequited passion looking at an installation at P.S. 1, wondering whether every artist had felt this way, and whether that was why artists made anything at all—to hold on to the feeling, or perhaps for revenge.

It was during this time that I was able to write my own story about the city in the form of a television show, “Girls,” which lasted for six seasons. The irony was that the series cemented me, in the minds of everyone I met, as a New York girl through and through. How could they have known that the safest I’d ever felt in New York was either hiding under the covers or pretending to be someone else under klieg lights? The character I played, Hannah Horvath, thought that New York held the key to all her dreams—but, tellingly, she’d grown up in Michigan. (I had been told by countless cabdrivers—soothsayers, all of them—that I seemed like I was from someplace else, because no matter how far off course they drove me, or how late I was running, I always babbled cheerful thank-yous, and unlike other native New Yorkers I had no preferred routes.) Hannah was an expression of homesickness for a place I’d never truly lived in, and of my hope that I could meet New York again under an assumed identity. In the series finale, she left New York and boldly set sail for . . . upstate New York, a story line that signalled how much of a question mark the rest of the world still seemed to me. I wasn’t a natural New Yorker, and yet I had a New Yorker’s certainty that there really wasn’t anywhere else to go.

A few years after “Girls” concluded, when I was in my early thirties, I was deep in the kind of heartbreak that I now know is on the required curriculum for that stage of adulthood but that seemed, in the moment, life-ending and completely unique to me. As if some higher power were sensing my need, work offered me the chance to leave. I’d escaped briefly before, but only to the equally bedevilling city of Los Angeles. This time I was headed farther afield, to explore the elfin mysteries of Wales. It was a sojourn fit for one of the Brontë heroines I had always loved (or so I thought, not realizing the difference between the moors of Yorkshire and the Celtic rain forests of Powys—a place that Charlotte, Emily, and Anne had likely never visited. Like me, the Brontës were homebodies.) In my mind, this break would provide a chance for New York and me to hook up with other people, reignite our feelings for each other, and then realize we were meant to be together all along. We all know how well that plan usually works out for couples.

One job bled into another. One year became the next. Wales—with woods so uncannily green I could compare them only to the computer game Myst—led to London, and London shocked me with its reassuring differences from New York. The city, which is large enough to contain all five New York boroughs twice, had a spaciousness I could not get over, streets so wide that the buildings seemed to be stepping aside for me to pass. Three decades of urban sense memory cleared, as if I had woken up to a system upgrade and damaged files had been erased in the process. Maybe it was the blank slate of it all, the fact that I’d yelped in pain on exactly zero London street corners. But it felt more mystical, like walking into a house I’d been to only in a dream. “Well, hello, *London Lena*,” a friend cooed when I agreed to go out for a third night in a row. My reputation back home was as a work-obsessed hermit with an inappropriate fear of the “human statue” performers in Times Square. Here, I moved with ease, whether walking on Hampstead Heath or sliding into a black cab, greeted by a gruff “Oy! Where you ’eaded?”

In New York—the fastest city in the world—days had felt like years. In London, years passed like days, which is how I ended up, five years on, realizing that London is my home now, so much so that I call seltzer “sparkling water” and settle for bagels that taste like caulk. Even when Londoners remind me of New Yorkers, the city doesn’t jangle me the way New York does. One recent weekend, a drunk man unzipped his fly to pee on my stoop, not noticing my presence behind some overgrown ivy. “Move it along, sir,” I told him. *You are in the wrong place*.

On my first journey back to New York after the pandemic—which had kept me away for nearly two years—the experience of walking out of J.F.K. and into the airport cab line was so powerful I nearly keeled over. One day back in the city left me breathless and panicky, outpaced. When friends and I made plans to get together, I’d suggest restaurants that had been shuttered for years. No matter how often I’ve returned in the time since, I’ve found myself standing anxiously at crosswalks, the way I would as a child, unsure when to step off the curb, as if trying to hop into a game of double Dutch. But now the sense of dislocation is temporary. The three-decade fight to mold myself to the city is over.

In Joan Didion’s essay “Goodbye to All That,” about her own decision to leave New York for her native California, she writes that New York is best suited to the very young. My grandmother said that it was no place for a child. All I know for sure is that it was simply no place for *me*—at least, not *forever*. And that’s O.K. Sometimes, in a relationship, you both try to show your best and truest selves, but still the other party sees only your worst. Plus, this was the most mature sort of breakup—the sort where we can still have coffee sometimes. It turns out that I felt about New York City the same way so many New Yorkers feel about whatever place they started: it’s just where I was born. ♦

I’m trying to find a coffee shop or any local spot in South Lincoln that offers a free conference room or meeting space for a small/medium group (about 6-10 people). Ideally, we’d be meeting sometime between 6 and 8 PM on a weekday for an hour and half give or take.

It doesn’t have to be super fancy—just a quiet enough space where we can talk and maybe work on some collaborative stuff. Free (or low-cost) is definitely preferred, and the closer to the south side of town, the better.

Does anyone know of any places that offer this kind of setup? Bonus points if the coffee is good!

Thanks in advance!

So much so that any time I go to try and play, I get stressed out trying to choose between a mechanically superior build, or one meant for RP.

For instance: Wood Elf Open Hand Monk with Tavern Brawler is crazy good from a mechanical standpoint. But Drow bard is baller from an RP standpoint.

Disclaimer: This is a relatively long report. I have not seen many detailed reports on this race so I decided to be over-inclusive,  in case my experiences and observations may be useful for others in the future. 


### Background 

I am a 44 year old male (152 lbs) with several years of casual running experience. In recent years, I’ve attempted to mitigate my mid-life crisis by investing a lot of time and energy in running. Have run 8 half marathons over the course of the past 20 years. On February 8, 2025, I achieved my half marathon PR of 1:30:50. (That race report is here.) 

I ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). I registered to run this White Mountains Marathon in May and the Berlin Marathon in September 2025. My goal—which felt extremely ambitious—was to qualify for Boston in one of those next two races (3:15:00).

### Training

I followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan for this training block. After a full week off following the NYC Marathon, I ran approximately 40 miles per week through the rest of November and December. I officially started the Pfitz plan on 12/30/2024. The Mesa Half Marathon, where I achieved my PR, marked the end of Week 6 of that 18-week marathon training plan. 

Training went well for the bulk of this block. I converted one lactate threshold workout to a general aerobic run after the half marathon but otherwise completed every workout and long run as scheduled in the plan. I trained based on a goal time of 3:10:00 to account for a Boston cutoff that I hope will be 5 minutes or less.

Here is a breakdown of the rough pacing I used as a guide during this training block based on my perceived level of fitness and goal time:

| Pacing Category | Heart Rate | Pace Range |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Marathon Pace | 82-88% Max HR | 7:15/mi |
| Lactate Threshold | 82-91%% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |
| General Aerobic | 72-81% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |
| Long Run | 75-84% Max HR | 7:59-8:42/mi |
| Recovery | <76% Max HR | >9:26/mi |

I did try to be aware of my heart rate but I was not a stickler about remaining in the recommended range, particularly for faster efforts and on long runs. If I’m honest, I still struggled to slow down as much as I should have for some of the lighter efforts. My general aerobic runs were probably closer to the 7:55-8:20/mile range. On recovery runs I would sometimes get a few miles above 9:00/mile but seldom did I average over 9:10/mile for any of those runs. 

The most challenging workout during this block was about five weeks out from race day: an 18 mile long run with 14 at marathon pace. I did hit the goal pace but that run took a lot out of me and left me questioning whether I could actually hold a 7:15/mile pace on race day. Aside from the Mesa Half Marathon early in the block, I did not do any tune up races during this cycle. Instead, I incorporated two 10K runs that I ran hard—short of an all-out effort but faster than lactate threshold. Those were both great for building confidence and helping me to assess where my fitness was in the lead up to the race. I ran the first of those in 41:09 and the second one at 40:35. Both of those times represented new PRs for me at that distance.

I did some hill work (uphill and downhill) throughout the course of the training block but not as much downhill as I thought I should have given the nature of this downhill course. There are a lot of rolling hills where I run so I think that even though I wasn’t doing “hill-specific” training, my legs were getting at least some of that conditioning in the course of my general training schedule.

I tapered for approximately three weeks consistent with the dictates of the Pfitz plan. I was feeling pretty achy and sluggish in that final week before the race. Was definitely in my head but tried to put trust in my knowledge that I followed every step of the plan through the entire 18 weeks.

### Training Conditions and Gear

I live in Maine. Due to cold and icy conditions, I completed about 50% of my training runs on a treadmill. As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. Have had some slight but ongoing discomfort in my right hamstring and Achilles tendon but I managed to keep those discomforts from developing into anything more debilitating in this training block. I try to do basic strength training about twice a week. (After the Mesa Half Marathon, I noted that I wanted to develop that component of my training more but I have not really done this. I am hoping I can be more structured when I transition to my training for Berlin.)

I train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions. Prior to finding this trainer, I experienced recurring and sometimes debilitating pain in each of my big toes. Because of the shoe adaptation and more careful monitoring of flareups, I made it through almost all of this training block with any significant disruptions in my training schedule due to health reasons. 

I did about a handful of my speed workouts in Hoka Cielo X1, which provides a plate to protect my toe along with responsiveness and bounce from the foam that helped generate some really snappy workout efforts during these months. 

### Pre-race

Arrived in New Hampshire on Saturday morning. Attended the race expo that afternoon. The expo was fairly standard. Not a lot of swag but good energy and efficient setup. I also picked up a pacing bracelet. I had spent a lot of time thinking about pacing and had a plan in mind. The bracelet was generally consistent with what I planned based on my pre-race research. 

We stayed at the Hilton2Suites, which was one of several hotels affiliated with the race. (It was also dog friendly.) Cost was reasonable, the accommodations were comfortable, and the location was just minutes from where I needed to catch the shuttle to the starting line on race morning.

I was fairly diligent with carb loading and hydration for the few days leading up to the race. I tend to have a sensitive stomach so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. Lots of bagels and pasta. I ate a plain pasta dinner at around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday. I was in bed by 7:30 p.m. although it took me a while to fall asleep. 

I woke up at 3:05 a.m. Had a few sips of coffee to get that essential plumbing moving. Success. Expecting a lot of rain, I applied more Body Glide than usual. Very glad I did! I caught the shuttle at around 3:40 a.m. It was about an hour ride from the shuttle pickup to the staging area at the start. I ate a bagel and finished my coffee during that ride. 

It was a very wet morning but thankfully not too cold—low 50s F. Arrived at the staging area, used the porta potty and then did my best to hunker down, thinking about my efforts to get to that moment while sipping sports drink for the next 45 minutes. 

I had a disposable poncho and layers of disposable clothing to stay warm and (mostly) dry. Was happy that I wore different shoes and socks on the shuttle. It was very nice to put on dry racing shoes (Alphafly 3) and socks to have relatively dry feet at the start of the race.

There was not a ton of space for warming up but because of the wet conditions small crowds (approximately 1200 racers), my pre-race routine was not bothered or derailed. After a short delay, the race started under steady rain at around 6:15 a.m.

### Race

Miles 1-5

The decline in these initial miles is significant (about 1400 feet). My plan was to go out at around 7:00 pace but given the substantial decline, I was flexible about going quicker based on my perceived effort. My paces were, in fact, quicker than planned but I truly felt that my effort was well within the range that I would expect for the start of a race. 

The downhill was certainly noticeable—significantly smoother (and easier) than the start of the NYC Marathon (or most of my long runs, frankly). I worked on maintaining a quick cadence with short strides to put as little pressure as possible on my quads as I navigated the downhill. That seemed to work for me. I didn’t notice any more muscular fatigue in this downhill segment (or overall on this downhill course) than I do in any other race or long run effort. 

Miles 6-10

While still feeling relatively fresh and composed, these next five miles for me were about settling in. Before the race, there was quite a bit of chatter about the uphill segment coming between miles 10-12. I was a bit in my head about that incline. 

I didn’t know if I would use the pacing bracelet but I found it very helpful during this segment and then throughout the remainder of the race. Because the pacing band is calibrated to account for elevation changes, it was a useful tool to gauge my effort in the context of where I was “supposed” to be at each mile marker in the race. With the assistance of the bracelet I approached the uphill segment knowing that I was about one minute ahead of the prescribed pace for a 3:10:00 finish. That buffer gave me peace of mind and freedom to moderate my pace as needed to minimize exertion during the climb.

Miles 10-12

The hill takes place in an up-and-back segment of an otherwise point-to-point course. It was challenging but when I got to it I felt prepared for it. Perhaps expecting something even more daunting,  I was able to lean into my experience running on rolling hills during the training cycle to navigate it fairly smoothly. It was approximately 200 feet of vertical and mostly gradual. I did allow my pace to drop significantly through this portion to prevent excessive fatigue but I did not feel at all derailed from my overall race plan and was still able to make it through this segment slightly quicker than contemplated on the pacing bracelet. 

The turnaround for the descent was very motivating. It was still too early to start feeling like I was “in the clear” but having observed several runners knocked down by the hill, I was feeling relieved and confident that I still felt strong and relaxed.

Miles 13-20

The field noticeably cleared after the half marathon marker. By the half marathon mark I was feeling mostly recovered from the uphill effort. My breathing was relaxed and I was settling back in around goal pace. 

This chunk of the race was described as “rolling hills” but it definitely felt more flat and downhill. There were a few short blips with slight climbs but, at least based on my experience, future racers should take heart that any perceived inclining segments in the latter half of the course are short lived.

I do think it is worth flagging the substantial camber in the road throughout much of the course. It wasn’t just in this segment but I think I was noticing it a bit more at this point in the race. I tried to be as strategic as possible, running at the center line of the road to minimize hip fatigue and using the camber to assist my effort to run some micro tangents and do my best to run no more than the straightest line through the course as the road weaved back and forth. 

I’ll also note here that my decision to stay toward the peak of the camber as much as possible also helped me avoid puddles and runoff that were present on a recurring basis on this very rainy morning. 

Miles 20-26.2

I felt very good when I hit mile 20. I continued to feel strong and was beginning to feel more confident that I would be able to hang on to reach my “A” goal. My stride still felt smooth and my breathing remained controlled. 

Then, almost out of nowhere, I felt the threat of stitch coming on at mile 23. I tried not to panic. I was about to have my 5th gel but decided to forego it. I opted to suck on a salt tab and got a good sip of water at the next mile marker. (I had a few salt tabs over the course of the race. I feel like they help mitigate the sweetness from the gels and also help keep my electrolytes in check.) I slowed slightly, focused on breathing, and pushed through it. 

By mile 24.5 that discomfort mostly subsided and I forged ahead to the finish, with a final 10K under 44:00. I busted through the finish line with a sense of pride, accomplishment, and euphoria that, I suppose, are what this is all about. 

Oh, and I got that BQ!

### Post-Race and Overall Impressions 

The course was spacious and comfortable throughout. The immersion in nature is fantastic but beware that there are almost no spectators in this race until mile 25+. I wondered what that would be like and whether I would want headphones to help carry me through it. I decided against headphones and I don’t regret it. 

For a Mainer who feels quite at home in the damp woods of New England, being able to hear the cascade of the river and streams throughout the course was very nourishing. I felt extremely focused and at peace throughout the entire run. I absolutely loved the crowds of the NYC Marathon but this race demonstrated that I can still conjure that race energy and adrenaline in the near silence of the White Mountains with nothing but the sounds of my breath, the cadence of my shoes hitting the pavement, and my own thoughts for 26.2 miles.

I truly didn’t know whether a BQ was in the cards for me. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. I feel so fortunate to have had this experience. 

I know that the Revel marathons are the source of all kinds of strong feelings for some runners. I tried not to engage with too much of that because I didn’t want to absorb any negativity that could impact my goals or undermine the value I place on the work I put in to get here. Qualifying for Boston has been a driving force for me during these past 2.5 years as I have built towards this. After New York, I knew that the downhill course would increase my chances of achieving that goal. But I knew it wouldn’t be easy. And it wasn’t easy! I  worked my ass off and I got the BQ. I did that with a lot of love and support from people around me and a lot of diligent commitment to myself. I am so emotional and so excited about that. But I also learned so much during this training block and in this race—about running, about myself as a runner, and about myself as a person generally—that is worth so much more than the numbers on the clock at the end of the race. 

Whether you seek a BQ, a PR, or you just want to tackle a different type of race where you truly have the opportunity to block out the noise in your life and do something special, I wholeheartedly recommend the White Mountains Marathon. 

I am very excited to continue on this journey! 

Next stop: Berlin!

I’ve sometimes noticed when I’m ordering coffee at a counter, am in a drive-thru getting food, and in other similar scenarios, if the person in the exchange is a man, he gets too comfortable or flirty with me. It could be oversharing, compliments, extended looks and smiles, etc. Things that are weird or inappropriate in my view for such a brief and transactional exchange. 
I worked in customer service for yearsss, so I know the difference between being warm and friendly (for those tips!) and being… that. 

I truly don’t think I’m doing anything overly friendly beyond smiling (sometimes) and saying hello. I’m actually not the warmest, bubbliest person. I also don’t want to make assumptions and be a rude customer. 

What are your experiences with this? How do you project boundaries? Or is this just something that happens and you live with it? I feel like I’m giving something “off” and I’d like to shut it down if possible because it leaves me feeling gross. ",0,1746501350.0,AskWomenOver30,3,0.5,False
1kfuq3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1kfuq3a/how_i_lost_a_best_friend/,How I lost a best friend,"Just to jump right into it. I added a coworker I had briefly interacted with a couple times on social media and after a few small conversations I asked her for a coffee. She told me she was into women but we kept being friends anyway and started to hang out a lot after work.



Over the course of around a year we got really, really close and I stupidly started to develop feelings for her and felt like I couldn't tell her because she is in general very distrustful of men and I thought she would stop being my friend if I told her.



Well, one day me her and some friends from work went to brunch, had a couple mimosas, went back to her place and kept drinking. We both got extremely drunk and I got too drunk to drive home and asked if I could take a nap on the couch or something. She cleaned out her bed and told me to go lay down in there.



Eventually the other friends leave and I wasn't asleep yet so I got up to say good night and good bye to them. When they left she told me to come to bed with her. I was up against the wall and she started grinding against me really aggressively. I tried to say we shouldn't because we had been drinking all day, but she kept going and I ended up getting into it. I went down on her and got up to go get some water and when I came back she was snoring softly so I just settled in next to her. We both ended up getting sick and getting up and down every 20 minutes for the rest of the night basically.



We talked about it after a couple days and both felt a little guilty about things going down while we both drinking heavily but ultimately she was like oh, it was fun we can do it again. So a few days later a group of us all go out again and afterwards I texted her trying to go back to her place. Initially she said no because she had to work but after some thinking and some flirting I ended up going to her place.



I went down on her again for like an hour this time and at the end of that she told me ""oh I just really don't like dick"" and kicked me out. 



We don't talk about it or much at all for the next couple days and she sent out a snap story like lets go to the bar and I hit her up like yo who's going I'm down. She doesn't say who's there but tells me I'm free to come if I want to and I wasn't doing anything so fine. I get there and shes there with a guy she had ""jokingly"" said she'd love to be with because he has money if he didn't live so far away. Things got weird quickly ( the bar randomly had a huge group of what seemed to be high schoolers show up? ) so I used that as an excuse to leave, my feelings a bit hurt. The week after I went out with a guy friend just hanging out and messaged her to see if she wanted to come out and she literally said ""please come to this beer themed place im begging."" I knew she had to be there with a guy because she doesn't like beer but despite my better judgement I went and when I got there she was already very drunk and sat at a table arguing with 3 guys. I sat at a nearby table because there was no space for a few minutes but she never looked up so I left.



I sent her an annoyed message that I knew I shouldn't have come and if I had stayed put where I was before I left it would have gotten really fun by then. She sent me back an equally annoyed message that she didn't know she would be in an argument with a couple of guys she didn't know when she thought she'd just be there with this other guy. I didn't sit with our friend group at work and basically gave her the cold shoulder that weekend and she noticed and messaged me a couple days later. I admitted that I handled it like an idiot and I was sorry. We talked it out and reconciled for a week or two. But that was weirdness number 1. 



Weirdness number 2 happened like 2 weeks later. Me, her, and her best friend all went out one night. She starts talking to her best friend, seemingly not worried about me sitting there at all, about this guy she just started talking to and how badly she wanted to hook up with him. I won't lie that one just really hurt me. It just felt like the only thing I could rest my ego on with why we didn't even work out in a casual since was because she was a lesbian and then this just made me feel so rejected. I've been rejected before but like never in bed like that, and it hurt bad. 



I made sure not to give her the cold shoulder this time at least. I told her that the way everything played out really made me feel like complete and total shit and that sometimes just being around her made me feel that way so I needed some space. About a week later she messaged me about my reactions to her posts and was I somehow trying to be mean or something (lol no?). We had a half hearted reconciliation and we were on decent footing again, not nearly the closeness as before but no weirdness. I sat with the friend group that weekend and we had the fun playful banter again and it was great.



And then I messed up really badly.



We happened to run into each other at the bar one night and we were friendly but not together like we would have been in the past. I felt a bit awkward still because her best friend was there and I never thought she liked me that much so I didn't sit with them. I then had about 4 drinks in about 45 minutes and tried to flirt with this girl. After a little while she told me she was gay and trying to make a self deprecating joke I said ""oh, not the first time I've tried to flirt with a gay woman and it didn't work out"" and glanced over at my friend. Well, that set the girl I was flirting with's friend off and she started badgering my friend about what we had going on. I couldn't hear what she said but I could tell what she was saying. The girl came back and was like oh yall are destined to be and I said no you're stirring some shit up right now please seriously stop. 



She did not stop. Periodically throughout the entire night she would pop over to my friends table and badger my friend about our relationship. Despite me asking her numerous times not to. The end of the night for me was I asked her one more time not to and she immediately went over to my friends table and started again so I got out of there embarrassed as hell. 



I apologized a couple days later when she didn't sit with the friend group at work and she told me she didn't want to speak to me anymore and called me immature and insecure. 



And thats where we are now. It's been about a week since she said that and about a week and a half since I stupidly blabbed to a stranger who harassed my friend and ruined her night. And fuck does it hurt. This woman accidentally gave me a push to stop being such a ridiculous shut in and get my life much closer to a state that I wanted it to be and now she won't even look at me. I basically had to beg her to give me any kind of support after we hooked up and she rejected me and she used my honesty for why I felt like I acted out of character to condemn me and say that it was in fact my character. And I still miss her.

I remember being in third grade and daydreaming about my teacher just holding my hand. That tiny gesture felt huge to me, even though I didn’t understand why. I just knew I felt warm. Safe. Different.

But I was scared to come out. I grew up hearing awful things about people like me. That they’d be rejected, abandoned, even hated. So I hid it. I dated a couple guys and hated every second. On top of that, I was sexually assaulted by three different men when I was a kid. I think those experiences rewired something in me. Or maybe they just confirmed what I already felt—that I’d never be safe in that world. That I could only breathe around women.

Now I’m in love with the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known. She’s 30. We’ve been together for 5 years, and she’s everything to me. But tonight she told me something that shattered me.

She said she feels like she has to “butter me up” to get me to want her. That I should just want her.

And I do. I really do. But tonight I was exhausted. I had just finished building her a greenhouse, then went to our son’s baseball game. I had even tried to be intimate that morning, but she was tired—she works third shift—and her mom was coming over. By 9 pm, I just didn’t have it in me. And she felt rejected. Again.

She’s not wrong to feel that way. This has been a pattern. I know that. I know I have walls. I know I’m more “vanilla” than she wants. And I hate that. I want to explore with her. I want to meet her where she is. I want to be wild with her, soft with her, everything with her. But I get stuck. I’m terrified. What if I try and she doesn’t like it? What if she finds someone who can give her what I can’t?

Her love language is acts of service, so I do everything I can to show her I care. I used to make her coffee, but she switched to tea and didn’t like how I made it. Still, every night I make the bed, turn on her heating blanket, lay out her pajamas, and make sure the space feels warm and safe for her. I tell her she’s beautiful. I tell her I’m lucky. I show up.

But it never feels like it’s enough.

Sex often feels like a job. Like a thing I’m supposed to do, not something I feel. And I hate that. Because when I can connect—when I feel safe and emotionally close—it’s amazing. I love it. I love her. I just don’t know how to access that feeling consistently. Most of the time, I feel blocked. Like a part of me is still frozen in that trauma. Like a piece of me never grew up.

My therapist hasn’t helped much with this. I don’t think I’ve ever really grieved what happened to me as a child. I never really let that part of me be held or healed. And now that pain is spilling into the one place I want most to feel safe and free—with her.

I want to love with love, not fear.

I want to be enough for her. I want her to feel wanted, craved, cherished. And I want to stop feeling like I’m broken.

1kfumd4,https://www.wafb.com/2025/05/06/exclusive-talks-underway-bring-more-ice-agents-la/,Operation Tidal Wave: Landry in talke to bring more ICE agents to La.,"Governor Jeff Landry has big plans for agents from ICE to come to Louisiana. There could be more of them in the state to crack down on the number of illegal immigrants connected to violent crime and gangs.

The governor’s plans involve talks with ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, to bring Operation Tidal Wave to Louisiana.

ICE started the effort in Florida, where they say in just one week, more than 1,100 violent gang members were arrested. It embeds federal agents alongside state and local law enforcement, giving them all the power to arrest those suspected of being in the country illegally.

“State and local law enforcement have really the most first-hand knowledge of what’s happening on the streets in Baton Rouge, and so for us to be able to integrate with them allows us to maximize our efforts at the federal level,” said ICE Deputy Director Madison Sheahan.

Sheahan talked to WAFB exclusively and said Operation Tidal Wave in Louisiana will be a record-breaking effort.

“Getting a violent criminal off the street, I think somebody that was convicted of child trafficking or just trafficking in general. We want to make sure those types of people aren’t embedded in our communities,” Sheahan explained.

A recent case involved 24-year-old Josmar Zambrano-Chirinos. He’s a Baton Rouge sex trafficker with reported ties to a Venezuelan gang. He took a plea deal last month.

Something like Operation Tidal Wave is happening with the Kenner Police Department, but not everyone’s a fan. Some immigration activists say programs like this only make immigrants more fearful of police.

This policy renders those little chats with the cops that they have with coffee absolutely obsolete. No one is going to come forward,” said Union Migrante member Rachel Taber.

Sheahan said it’s about keeping our streets safe.

Louisiana State Police said in a statement, “The Louisiana State Police continues to work closely with our federal, state, and local partners to ensure the enforcement of both state and federal laws. At this time, no specific operational plans have been finalized.”",9,1746500990.0,Louisiana,3,0.91,False

The teacher told me Miss 12 got heaps of bits of paper. But more importantly, she said Miss 12 put nice comments in all of the bags that didn't get many. And encouraged her best friend to do the same.

Also Hi, I (24) about 2 years ago started noticing a lot of changes in my body, cramping randomly throughout my cycle, pretty mild ovulation cramps (which has never been a thing for me), severe bloating, continuous constipation.  (To where every 3 days i have to take a laxative tea).
I started just monitoring my body, cutting things out, coffee, sweets, etc. Realized nothing was really making a difference. 
At the time I didn't really have good health care. It was costing me 300$ just to be SEEN by a doctor. So I told myself when I got better health insurance I would take care of myself. 
Im a firm believer in the whole ""listen to your body"" thing. I truly believe you, and only you know when something is not right.
Anyway, ive been doing a ton of research, looking into my family history etc. And came up with 3 possible solutions as to what could be wrong.
1. Fibroids
2. Cysts
3. Endometriosis

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago I found a really great obgyn. Super friendly staff, I felt listened to, I addressed my concerns, and got scheduled for a vaginal ultrasound right away. 
5 days ago I had my ultrasound.
I was told no fibroids, or no cysts. 
Few. That's great news right?.

Then the other np comes in the room after the fact to let me know that yes im cleared for those, however they discovered liquid in my tube. Hydrosalpinx she said. She said it was hard to tell which tube, because they were both overlapped, but that it most likely is the left one. 
Me being shocked I basically asked what that meant and what causes it and she began to tell me that it could be endo but she couldn't tell me for sure without a laparoscopy. 
I proceeded to ask her if Hydrosalpinx would affect my fertility and she said it could.
She let me know that it wasn't super urgent,  that I could think about what I wanted to do.

And thats all I've been doing every day. THINKING.
Im so spun around I have absolutely no idea what to think. Now im concerned at the fact that I won't even be able to have kids. I've done nothing but lurk on this page just reading other people's horror stories! 
Im about to be 25. I always gone back and fourth of if i wanted kids, but I think it would be horrific if I dont even get the option! I've been with my boyfriend coming on 3 years.
He's been nothing but supportive, but unfortunately he just doesnt get the full extent of it, so I've kinda just come on here to idk rant? Not really sure what im looking for,but maybe someone out there has advice or words of wisdom? I have no idea.
But now im like, okay I went in for one thing and left with a whole nother problem. 
I still think I have endo,  as a matter of fact im like 90% sure just given my symptoms over the past couple of years.
All I can think of is how long has my tube been clogged? Is it fixable? Do I have to get it removed? I must have to get it removed because it can cause harm to any potential fetuses.

Right now I think my next step is just basically confirming which tube is blocked and how severely.
So im thinking of either hsg, or possibly an MRI. Something not as invasive as a laparoscopy right off the bat.
I've tried to reach out to the dr office to just ask all my questions but haven't heard back yet which is kinda making matters worse.
My concern is just doing a laparoscopy first without any further knowledge.  I would like to avoid that all together but upon my research thats the only way to test for endometriosis ( correct me if im wrong) .",3,1746500470.0,WomensHealth,0,1.0,False

my ex (20f) broke up with me (20m) after a 10 months relationship. she was my first love, i was her 6th, but she trusted me so much she gave me her ""first time"" which made me cherish her even more. however i was inexperienced during the relationship, constantly avoided her during our small, bickering ""arguments"". and due to my job i couldn't spend enough time for her and i had weird temper. i did take her to our uni, trained together at the gym, took her to coffee shops to do our assignments, some little dates, came over to her apartment and had intercourse most of the time.

i thought that was enough time spent for her. but because i was too busy i couldn't take her to the airport (3 times, she's an exchange student in my city, her home city is on the other side of my country) she got sad over that and told me she didn't want me to make excuses. she also had difficulty making friends in a different city. i was inexperienced, but i feel like she wasn't that forgiving and understanding about...why i was constantly busy. she said she understood but she still wanted me to spend time when i barely could spend time for myself. so she broke up with me on the 10th month.

however after 3 weeks i reached out to her again and we texted again. but a few weeks passed and i got scared, thinking i might hurt her again, and i unintentionally avoided her. so 3-4 months after that she really did try to pull me back, she was willing to give me another chance. but again, i was scared. and also i messed it up even more because i started texting another girl and she didn't know that, she still doesn't, but my ex said she would wait until i'd calmed down. another 3 months passed (now), i was finally certain about my feelings, she told me she has moved on and she doesn't wanna give me another chance anymore. she is more focused on herself and she is...happy. i am happy for her too. but i still love her so much. i begged and cried and did what i shouldn't have done when people try to get their exes back. ***i also made the dumb mistake of venting out my feelings about our relationship on my facebook account.*** she saw my posts and she didn't like them. she told me she doesn't have anything else to say to me and no longer has any reason to see me again.

***i don't know what to do. i don't want to lose her.*** she did tell me to try and focus on myself and try to change myself. she said we could videocall sometimes, but she changed her mind about that after a few days. i feel like i've changed a lot. but we did videocall once a few days ago and she said she felt like i was still the same person before. she said she will come back to my city in June 2026 to finish her last 2 semesters. but i'm afraid by that time she will have already fully moved on, or will have found someone else. i'm still trying to text her, she still replies. but she just doesn't really reach out for me. i understand why she no longer does that. i made her wait for me during those 4 months she was trying to pull me back. i messed up. i don't want her to go..",1,1746500226.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hi, I am Thomas! Living life to the fullest as best I can these days, but I am not interested in doing it alone. I want to have someone to cherish and hold while we talk about anything and everything. I got my faults like being overweight and depression, however it’s improving thankfully! Thankfully, I got my own place and a decent life…I just hate being alone all the time. I want to have some cooperation with someone but not be too excessive of course! Just enough to make life worth living and enjoy which is what I seek most. 

Some things about me:

	
◦	6 feet tall, hazel eyes, brown hair, shaved face, and I wear shorts almost all year round, unless I am at work.

	◦	Enjoying the outdoors is very much a priority for me
	◦	I love collecting movies and watching them on my fancy, expensive TV (not to brag or anything)
	
◦	Riding my bicycle and traveling are enjoyable to me plus I got bike rack for my car for two bicycles
	
◦	Cooking is something I want to get better at and all ready have a good assortment of tools for the job in my kitchen and would like to acquire more
	
◦	I enjoy tea and coffee more than most things

So here's my favourite and least favourite Daily Quests:

Favourites - Probably the ""Foodie"" series of quests, mainly because it's extremely quick, easy, and fast travelling there isn't a huge hassle since he's close to the entrance of City F. Plus, if you've completed the chain once, you're just able to just skip the questions entirely and it's easy money. The last quest of this chain is even easier, not even requiring me to answer any of the questions. This one's just super convenient for me.

I'd also go for anything that involves fighting a monster since it's at least mildly fun, apart from ""Drifter's Treasure 3"" for the tedious travel distance of those quests.

Least Favourites - I have two:
- The ""Coffee Research Diary"" series of quests, besides the last one. I don't really like these at all. They aren't hard, but they're just tedious, feeling longer than it actually is. The reason they are for me is because I always need to go to the coffee shop, which I can't just fast travel in or out of, meaning having to wait through at least four load screens just for the coffee shop parts. It could be just me, but my load screens take about 5-7 seconds a pop. On top of that, I usually need to go to some other places that requires another load screen. The worst of these has to be the Maids Café one, since you have to travel to another city for quite a long distance and enter another building you have to get in and out of, and totals to eight load screens...
- The ""Drifter's Treasure"" series of quests. It's mainly for one reason, you have to travel a long distance, from City Z to the sewers, then go through one tunnel system to another before you finally get to him. It's really boring and I wish there was a way to teleport to every major location, not just the main city areas of each city (how I feel about the coffee quests too). The only upside is that you can teleport out of the sewers back to HQ easily once you're done.

As I said, I don't have a super strong opinion on any of these side quests, so anything I say here isn't me outright loving or hating them, I just find a few to be better or worse than others is all.",2,1746499659.0,OnePunchManWorldGame,1,1.0,False

It does literally every none frozen drink including coffee that you can imagine. I'm tempted to write them an email if the response is good. 

The machines are sleek, fast, and super intuitive, people absolutely love them, there is usually a line for them and people will even pick where they want to live because there's one of them in the lobby (no joke, I almost picked that location and the machine being there was a selling point) 

Only 2 concerns if I can connect with them: 
1) the machines are high maintenance
2) no clue how this type of offering would do in America, I can see it well used in NYC, but how about regular high traffic malls or downtown areas of none major cities.

Would love to discuss this and maybe if we get enough interest we can be the first to do this together.

## Key Features Analysis

The elements that define a successful man cave decor scheme extend beyond mere aesthetics. They encompass practical considerations that enhance comfort,utility,and overall enjoyment of the space.

**Smart Lighting Systems:** Integrating smart lighting systems allows for customizable ambiance.Users can adjust brightness,color temperature,and even create pre-programmed scenes perfect for movie nights,game days,or quiet relaxation. These systems often integrate with voice assistants for hands-free control and energy efficiency.

A system with tunable white light is essential. This allows you to shift from cool, radiant light for activities like working on projects to warm, dim light to relax while watching movies or playing video games. Many systems can also be programmed to gradually dim the lights for bedtime reading which greatly enhances relaxation and sleep quality.

**Soundproofing Materials:** Achieving optimal soundproofing is crucial, especially if the man cave is intended for entertainment or loud hobbies. Acoustic panels, thick curtains, and sound-dampening insulation can substantially reduce noise bleed, preventing disturbances to other household members and ensuring a focused environment within the cave.

High-density foam panels, available in various textures and colors, not only absorb sound waves but also contribute to the overall aesthetic. consider layering different materials to maximize sound absorption across a wider frequency range. This is especially important if you plan for activities involving music, games or entertainment.

**Comfort-Centric Seating:** Ergonomic seating is paramount for long hours of relaxation or gaming. Recliners with lumbar support, oversized beanbag chairs, and modular sofas provide a variety of options for different activities. Look for durable materials that can withstand heavy use and are easy to clean.

Modular sofas are an excellent choice for their versatility. They can be easily rearranged to accommodate different group sizes or activities. Reclining features offers premium comfort for extended relaxation. Consider investing in high-quality leather or microfiber upholstery for durability and aesthetic appeal.

**Customized Storage Solutions:** Keeping the man cave organized is essential for maximizing its functionality and appeal. Customized storage solutions such as built-in shelves, cabinets, and concealed compartments offer ample space for housing entertainment systems, collectibles, and other personal items.

Wall-mounted shelves are a great option for showing off collectibles. Hidden compartments behind hinged wall panels give practical spaces to store items which are frequently used but don't need to be within constant visible access. Consider integrating cable management systems to maintain a tidy look by concealing wires and cables.

**Integrated entertainment Systems:** A centerpiece of any man cave is the entertainment system. This often includes a large-screen television, a high-quality sound system, and gaming consoles. Integrating these components seamlessly into the decor ensures a visually appealing and immersive experience.

Consider a projector system for a truly cinematic experience. This allows you to create a colossal screen, which is easily stored when not in use. Don't neglect the audio – a surround sound system can drastically enhance the experience when viewing sports games or action movies, bringing an element of immersion which transforms everyday vieweing into a unique experience.

Need advice on how to move on without it being awkward.,"I (f) developed a crush on this guy for a little over a month now. Thinking back I think I saw him before in my apartment lobby. It was months ago but I didn’t know who he was or was interested at that time. He was just a random guy who waved “Hi” at me through a glass door while I was waiting for the elevator 😅. I smiled and waved back but didn’t think much of it.

Fast forward to a little over a month ago, and I’m in my apartment’s gym. In walks in this HANDSOME guy that made me stutter on the elliptical. Almost locked up my knee when I saw him. Visually and physically he is very attractive, and I couldn’t stop staring. Thank goodness his back was to me while he was on the treadmill.

We would catch each other’s eyes and he would smile and nod in greeting and I would do the same. We never spoke in the gym due to I wore headphones and I like to be in the zone when I work out. I NEED my music and podcasts to distract me from the physical beating I give myself with a little bit of motivation. He doesn’t wear headphones at all which I noticed when he was closer to me on one occasion. 

After a point of seeing each other in our gym routine, it felt like we were “gym buddies” and he seemed to make sure I see him to greet me when he arrives. FYI, I always arrive in the gym before he does, and would usually be at the dumbbells with my back to the cardio machines (which is where he starts). He made it a habit to find me, make eye contact and wave hello before he starts his workout. I thought it was cute.

Then I finally got the courage to talk to him! Something simple and I rehearsed the heck out of it for days. One thing about me is I make it a point to not show any interest in a guy unless I know for sure it’s mutual interest. Otherwise, he will never know and I’ll continue to just be polite and nice. Smile and nod. Laugh politely and make small talk. Keep it short and leave. Nothing different from how I speak to others.

I was prepared to say something small in the gym but when the elevator opened there he was; on his way to the gym same as me. He smiled and nodded and I smiled politely and said hi. I was nervous and completely forgot what I wanted to say but I wanted to say SOMETHING! So I gave him a genuine compliment on his tattoos (I love a guy with tats especially full sleeves and he has them). We had a small chat while on the elevator and then we got to the lobby. I’m not exaggerating when I say he ran (or jogged) to open the door for me to pass through. My walking gate is faster than his so I made it to that door in record time. He sped up his walk; I heard the quick steps. It shocked me a little, but I love chivalry. What a gentleman, right? He wished me a “hope you have a great workout” and I wished him the same. I was on Cloud Nine! I finally said something, and I didn’t stumble over my words.

This is where the high starts to wane 😔.

One day he came in the gym with a girl. I didn’t think too much of it but still was curious: was she a friend or girlfriend? (Definitely not siblings: he’s white and she’s black… unless adopted 😅. SPOILER: not adopted). So he guides her to the treadmill and with how close he was to her I immediately thought “definitely gf”. However, I kept catching him looking over at me often. When he was talking to his gf, he would cut his eye over at me then resume talking to her. When they moved to the weight rack, he cut his eye to me as he walked past. Once I was done with my workout, I kept my eyes forward and didn’t look at him. However while his gf was doing stretches and as I passed then he looked over at me but said nothing. That was first and only time he didn’t say anything to me, understandably so.

Though at the time I didn’t have full confirmation she was his gf, I assumed with the way they interacted for sure they were together. I was sad, of course but not devastated. This may sound bad, but I never allow myself to truly believe any crush may develop into something real. I always believe there is a 1% chance of this happening and I just live in my daydream of make believe and live a whole life with my crush until the crush dies out and I move on. It allows me to enjoy the “lovey-dovey” emotions while preserving my feelings.

The next time I see him it’s at the gym and it’s as if nothing changed. He made sure to find me, wave hello and started his workout. I noticed he started to exercise closer to me even when there is more space elsewhere (seriously, it was only us in the gym). There’s plenty of space and I make it a point to take the smallest area possible to allow someone else the room. He chooses to stretch right behind me, weight lift right next to my face. He even walked closely behind me while on the elliptical. As much as I thought “could he be interested in me? I hope so” and kept reminding myself of the girl he brought in before and how he might be taken.

Then one day I saw him and the girl from before exit the elevator while I am crossing the lobby en route to the elevator. I was staring at the girl to get a better look at her and wasn’t looking at him. It wasn’t until we were practically shoulder to shoulder that I looked at him and he smiled, nodded his head and mouthed a “Hi” in passing. I smiled and nodded and continued on.

Eventually I just kept my head in my gym routine and tried my best to focus on other things. Even the few times he came to the gym, I kept my headphones on, turned the music louder and left before he was done or stayed longer so he left first. Tried to limit interaction with him as best as I could.

Now for what happened today:

I’m in the gym and rounding out my cardio for the night when he enters. I kept my eyes down on my phone watching a video but I notice he slows his walk to the treadmill and see him looking at me. I look up and he smiles and says “it’s cold in here” and laughs a little bit. I smile and agreed before he started his workout (tbh it was. The A/C was cranked on high as if it was 95 degrees in the summer. It’s 65 outside! wtf?).

I leave the gym first and make my way to the elevators. As I’m waiting for it, I notice it’s still going to upper floors so I got my mail thinking I have time. When I came back, he’s at the elevators too. He stared at me and looked like he wanted to say something and it felt kind of awkward so I made small talk:

Me: “Had a good workout?”

Him: “Yea. I’m really sweaty which is weird considering it was really cold in there.”

Me: “Yea it was pretty cold. Someone must have told them to turn on the A/C.”

Him: “What about you? Had a good workout?”

Me: “I’m sweaty too but had a good workout as well.”

Him: “Good. Do you come down here often?”

Me: “Yep. 5 days a week, 2-3 times a day.”

Him: “That’s a lot. You’re not tired?”

Me: “No. I space it out. Cardio in the morning and weightlifting in the evening”

Him: “Oh wow. I couldn’t do that. My heart would beat like an old man’s and I would start to get dizzy and get out of breath lol” (this man looks like he exercises on a daily bases with muscles pushing through his shirt 🤨. His thighs and calves are shapely and he uses 50lb dumbbells to do lower body… sir don’t play stupid with me 😆).

“Then too I also drink a lot of coffee”

Me: “I do too, but maybe not as much as you do I think.”

Him: “You must have good genetics then to be able to do that.”

Me: “I hear an accent. Where are you from?”

Him: “Russia.”

(I’m shocked. Not because he’s Russian but I clued in on the accent a while back but couldn’t place it to save my life so I called him “Russian Guy” for the longest until I had the courage to ask him. I had it right all this time lol).

Me: “What are you doing in USA? Do you have family still in Russia?”

Him: “I’m here to be a US citizen. Yea, but I don’t speak to them much.” (S/N: I wanted to ask him why doesn’t he keep in touch with them but decided to keep that to myself.)

Me: “Do you have family here?”

Him: “I think you saw my gf before, right?”

Me: *Nod in heartbreak*

Him: “Yea, I live with her here. No other family. Just us. What about you? Do you live here alone and have family here?”

Me: “Born and raised here, and I live here in the apartment alone but my family is still here in the city.”

Him: “Oh you must love it here.”

Me: “I love the city. It’s home to me but I love to travel.”

Him: “Here in the States or outside?”

Me: “Outside.”

Him: “Have you been to Argentina?”

Me: “No.”

Him: “You should go. You’ll like it.”

At that time, the elevator stopped on my floor and there was a guy about to get on. I beelined out of the elevator before he could say anything else. When I got into my apartment, I had a goofy smile on my face. Not only was it the longest convo I had with him but I genuinely enjoyed our conversation and I wanted to know more about him. I had more questions I wanted to ask. Then as I replayed our conversation, the confirmation of he has a gf put a damper on my head excitement. And out of respect for his relationship, and to put a stop to any progression on feelings I need to stop interacting with him.

The issue is I see him at my apartment gym and sometimes pass him in the lobby and hallways. It’ll be awkward to just ignore him, especially since he goes out of his way to make sure I see him so he waves hello, and now it seems he’s comfortable to make small talk in the gym and at the elevator. It’ll can see where he may want to engage in conversation in the future and I would have to put in major effort to not develop stronger feelings.

Has anyone ever ran into something like this and how did you handle this? Any advice on how to navigate this as this is in my apartments gym and just ignoring him would not only be rude but also difficult.

Inspo: I really like home tours of Anitta and Chrissy Teigen/ John Legends on Architectural Digest 😅 but don’t have that budget lol. 

Considerations: I have a dog and a bird with colorful toys. Given up trying to “fit” a color scheme since me and my bf just like to buy random chotchkies anyways that are just cute and make us laugh. 
The 5x8 rug in the kitchen is mostly bc my dog is 10 now and his right leg kind of slips 😕, but it wouldn’t hurt to have more color in the kitchen (gray and modern cabinets with black handles). So I found this rug on Amazon but not loving it…it’s more of a bohemian flower girl vibe to me more than anything. Want something more modern and chic and also fun, but rugs are so hard!! 

My place is messy with doggy pillows everywhere right now. But in my mood board, the bottom right is basically furniture that we have currently: gray couch, cream rug, pink and brass chair, black and wood ikea recliner…plus another wood dining table that my MIL handed down to us lol. would likely replace the gray couch bc the pillows flew off when we moved, but would probably go with a modular light/ dark gray couch anyways bc we have a dog. 

I’m liking the pictures from Desenio (bananas, coffee mugs, dog with scarf) bc they’re cute and fun but worried they might come off a little bit kiddy. We are early to mid 30s 😬

1kftogm,https://www.reddit.com/r/jura/comments/1kftogm/jura_repair_experiences/,Jura repair experiences,"tl;dr...Hello, brand new member here. I thought I'd share some past and recent experiences with Jura and repairing my Jura machines. I have a J90 and a J6. The J90 has been back to the US Jura repair facility multiple times, with many of those paid for by me. A couple times, the problem occurred within the blink-of-an-eye repair warranty period and I paid only for the shipping to New Jersey (here in the States, it costs $400-500 to send an out-of-warranty machine back to Jura for repairs).

I like the J90. But it sure seems to have recurring problems that an expensive machine shouldn't. Most recently, I sent it back last September after getting an error message that wouldn't clear. When I received it back, the beans in the hopper never fed correctly, and I had to push them down with a wooden chopstick—not occasionally, every time. I was annoyed, but okay with this because it's a hassle to box up and ship out. Then in March, I started getting the ""Not enough ground coffee"" error despite there being plenty of beans in the hopper. I called Jura. Of course, I was past the repair warranty period. They told me that either I could send it back and pay the usual $470 to have it fixed, or I could get a discount on a new machine. The discounts did not make any of the machines affordable.

I did what any cheapass but discriminating coffee drinker would do: I bought a used Jura J6 at Goodwill. This machine is very similar to the J90. This particular machine was pretty beat up, but it cost a *lot* less than the Jura repair charge, much less a brand new machine. It's a good thing that the J6 is a lot like the J90, because my Goodwill machine was short a few parts that I found were plug-and-play from the now-crippled J90.

The J6 worked for a while. But it was ""rode hard and put away wet"", as some might say. I think it must've been used in an office or a small restaurant, because not only was it cosmetically beat up, the counter revealed it had spewed out over 11,000 servings! No wonder it looked well-worn.

The J6 worked for a while. But then, maybe ironically, it gave me the same ""Not enough ground coffee"" error that I had on my J90. As my ex-wife used to tell me...repeatedly...""There's a reason it was at Goodwill.""

So, another call to Jura. They recommended some superficial actions like vacuuming out the beans hopper and wiping things off with a paper towel, which I knew in advance wouldn't do anything. Then came the ""You'll have to send it back to us"" alternative, which I also knew in advance I would not do. That left me with two essentially dead super-automatic Jura machines, and a pour-over cone and filter morning coffee regimen.

All of this forced me into a dark place: YouTube, Jura repair videos, and Amazon. It may have changed my (coffee-drinking) life. Here's a little-known fact: Jura uses semi-proprietary oval-headed screws to hold their machines together. This is the only application I have ever seen these used in. Without a special oval-headed wrench, they would be impossible to remove. Not surprisingly, but fortunately, these can be found on Amazon. I ordered a couple, from different vendors (unlike everything else associated with Jura, they are not expensive). I also ordered a couple of sets of stainless steel grinder burrs, since my issues seemed to revolve around coffee grinding  malfunctions of some sort.

While I was waiting for parts and tools to arrive, I watched the YouTube videos on Jura disassembly and repairs. Repeatedly. As it turns out, taking these machines apart is not rocket science. It's pretty straightforward, if you watch the YouTube videos obsessively. Which I did. Six oval-headed screws, three torx 15 screws, and the sides and the top come off. With the outside removed and the insides laid bare, a mere mortal can access the grinder mechanism and brew group. The overused J6 from Goodwill was particularly nasty inside, with lots of ground coffee, mold—and a cleaning tablet stuck in the gullet of the tube exiting the grinder feeding into the brew group. Everything was easy to vacuum out and clean up. Changing out the grinder burrs took a little more effort, and study of the YouTube video. Reassembly of the machine went fine.

This morning, with some trepidation, I fired up the J6 and voilá! Espresso! No error messages!

To cut this overly long story short...same deal with the J90. I opened it up and cleaned ground coffee out of the clogged feeder tube. Reassembly, power, another functioning Jura espresso machine.

Moral of the story is that if you're outside of your warranty, you can work around (some) malfunctions of these complicated super automatics. Give it a try. You may be surprised, like I was.

1kftmqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kftmqu/dumped_after_2_great_dates_and_feeling_shattered/,Dumped after 2 great dates and feeling shattered,"I got dumped over the week by a girl I went on two dates with, and it almost feels as bad as the heartbreak I had after breaking up with my college girlfriend of nearly five years.

I matched with a girl about a month ago that lives in a city about an hour away, and we quickly went from some light talk about an activity to planning a coffee date. I couldn't tell much from the first date, I felt like I was awkward but the conversation went well. We walked around after coffee for a few hours until she had to leave, but we both agreed we were looking for something more serious and long term. I hinted at another date and she started blushing, saying that she would really like that.

We planned another date immediately for the next weekend. She listed a few different restaurants and said that we could always go to the other ones another time, so she was hinting at having even more dates. Throughout the week we didn't text much, just small stuff that I guess made us think of each other.

For the second date, we met up for an activity, then got dinner afterward. Dinner went well, at one point she was brushing her foot against my leg. After dinner we got ice cream and walked around a neighborhood for several hours, just getting to know each other and laughing. Afterward, we were in her car talking and eventually starting making out. We went between that and talking more for another hour or two, and talked a little about a third date where she would come to my city, but she had to travel the next weekend for a conference, and the weekend after that was her grad school graduation, but said she would be free that weekend. She also mentioned she preferred getting to know me in person rather than text. 

I drove home, and texted her the next day about having a third date in two weeks. She agreed and seemed excited. The week leading up to her conference, we didn't text much, just some light stuff again. Over the weekend of her conference, she started texting me more. I guess while she was at the hotel when it was over, she had more free time. We texted about the city she was staying in and the show was watching.

When she got back home on Sunday, she let me know, and I asked her about the flight. It took her almost a day to respond. I was a little worried that it took so long, because even though we didn't text a lot the previous two weeks, it would only take like 2-4 hours for her to respond. I chalked it up to being tired from travel and needing to catch up on things at home. When she responded, I asked something else, and again she took a day to respond. I became extremely anxious. I had a gut feeling that something was not right, so I started talking to my friends about what could be happening. They all reassured me that it didn't seem like anything was going wrong, she was probably just busy and not a big texter, but I didn't feel any better.

I winded down the conversation and didn't ask anymore questions. I waited another day before texting her again with the plans for our weekend. She responded that she wanted to reschedule because her family came a day early for her graduation. I said I could do earlier, but she said that wouldn't work, and after her graduation she was going on a family trip for two weeks, but would love to see me after that. I wasn't super thrilled about that, but I told her that I still wanted to go out with her. I also asked if we could at least do a call to catch up, and she agreed and said she'd find time for that before she left.

The weekend comes around, and I'm giving her space to be with her family, but I'm very stressed about the situation because it's a long time to go without a date. I spent the day with two of my female friends and talking to them about the situation, and mentioned sending her flowers for her graduation. They both thought it'd be a really sweet/thoughtful gesture but I didn't know where to send them, so I asked her if I could send her something for graduation and where it would be okay to send them.

Her response was that she appreciated the gesture but didn't think that I was a good fit for her right now and dumped me. I was a little blind-sided because she had just been saying how excited she was to see me, said she was finding time to do a call, had been talking about future dates previously, and was texting me so much the last weekend when she was out of town. The only thing that I can think of was asking about the flowers, but I feel like that could have been brushed off with a ""that's nice but you really don't need to"" or something.

We had both established at the beginning we were looking for a relationship, nothing short term/hookup kind of thing. We had a lot of similar interests and beliefs.

It's been a few days now, and I feel like shit. I felt like we had a really good connection after the second date. It was everything I was looking for, and it was directly in front of me. It felt like everything was going right and in the right direction. Now I'm just confused. I've been swiping on apps for year, and talking to girls at bars or social events for years, and never found anything like this. I feel so hopeless now.",1,1746497873.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
