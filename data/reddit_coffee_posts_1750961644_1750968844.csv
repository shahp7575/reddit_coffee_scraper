1llaah8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1llaah8/stay_away_from_the_red_lake_tavern/,Stay Away From The Red Lake Tavern,"The great State of Wisconsin is known for many things. Cheese, bumpy roads, breathtaking sights… Well, you can scratch that last one if you are in the 80% of land covered with nothing but corn and wheat fields. But, there is one thing that the Dairy State has flown under the radar for. Wisconsinites love to drink. In fact, we have the highest rate of binge drinking out of the entire United States. With that, you wouldn't be surprised to know that there are bars everywhere. You could throw a stone in any of our “historic” downtown streets and there is a high chance you will hit a bar, inn, tavern, etc. It is why so many small establishments often go overlooked. 



After I finished work tonight, I decided to take the back roads home instead of I-94 (my usual commute). There's no feeling quite like driving down a dead, dark, almost dreamlike road in the middle of nowhere. My dim headlights were barely able to reveal any of the abandoned houses and barns that I passed. But I found a light in the darkness, a bright little establishment tucked away in a miniscule settlement. The building looks unkempt but not quite abandoned. The walls were painted white at some point, but exposure to the elements have cracked it into a spiderweb-esque pattern. Even the wooden supports of the front porch have cracked under the test of time. And yet, a warm yellow light pours from the sporadically cracked windows. Perhaps strangest of all, the place is packed! Cars litter the parking lot which is no more than a gravel clearing. I should mention that it seems these country goers have no idea how to park. No rhyme or reason to their spots! Despite it being a Tuesday night, I decided to stop for at least a shot or two. Walking past a door to the main floor, I see a large, almost brand new looking sign on the side of the establishment. A clean white canvas with red fancy lettering. The Red Lake Tavern.



I was pretty shocked upon entering the bar, which was quaintly running out of the basement. It’s very clean and very full! The decor and activities were about what I expected. Neon beer signs, slot machines, pull tabs, the whole nine yards. Despite the basic look, the energy was akin to a bustling saloon. People conversing at tables, sipping on their craft beers, playing pool, going head to head in some drinking games, and even smoking cigarettes. I'm one of those weirdos that doesn't mind the cigarette smell, but this place didn't reek of burnt tobacco. It smelled cold and dusty, like that one relative's unused basement you played in as a kid. The bartender (I didn't catch her name) was very personable and easy to talk to. I asked her why I've never heard of the place, to which she said what I told you at the beginning of this post. She mentioned that she and her husband own the place and even live in the unit upstairs.



I'm not one to write reviews like this, especially since most of these dive bars don't stand out, but this place is special. The liquor is dirt cheap, the atmosphere is immaculate, even the bathrooms are squeaky clean (despite not having plumbing it seems)! I mention that because I may or may not be writing this on the pooper. I see it as necessary though! I want more people to check this place out! If you are near >!**I'M STARVING**!< and don't have allergies, I highly recommend checking out The Red Lake Tavern.



5/5 Stars: Highly recommended! 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Apparently, I wrote that one a little over a month ago.



I do not remember writing this. Hell, I don't even remember ever visiting that bar before tonight.



That review is my favorite out of the 25 documents I've found in my Google Drive so far. I must've been in a good mood that day. There is some variation in the posts. Most are pretty short and basic but sometimes I just ramble about the place for pages upon pages. Sometimes someone comes up and talks to me, sometimes I end up playing cards, and sometimes I just sit silently with the bartender. My last review from a couple days ago even details getting a splinter from a wooden table. I still have it. But in every post, I mention how nice the lady tending the bar is, I always get a drink, and I always end up writing a post recommending The Red Lake Tavern while taking a dump. As you do, I guess.



Thank the Lord none of these got posted. I'm guessing my phone plan doesn't cover the middle of nowhere as these were all written in Drive’s offline mode.



But something different happened tonight that allowed me to uncover all of this.



It was really busy at work, as most Fridays tend to be. My social battery was sufficiently depleted and I wanted a change of scenery. When I first started working here, a customer told me that there was a back road that basically leads from my work to my hometown. I had nothing to lose, so I turned right out of work instead of left.



The road was desolate. It gets dark as early as 5 PM this time of year, so my headlights were the only illumination I had. Large empty fields on both sides of the road were only broken by the occasional abandoned plot of land. Road conditions were slick so I was driving pretty slow. I thought that was why I noticed it. A bar that I had never seen before. It looked a little run down, but it was busy enough that I felt confident to stop in. There were tons of cars next to the establishment, all of them were randomly strewn across the gravel. I remember thinking ‘parking isn't that hard, people’ as I slammed my car door shut and gazed upon the building that loomed over me. It looked like a single story house with a front porch and all. The only indication of business was a large sign over the basement entrance that read “The Red Lake Tavern” in basic black font. The front door creaked loudly upon entry, but the overwhelming sound of dozens of drunk patrons gambling, conversing, and singing made it seem like nothing more than pin drop. 



It was about what I expected out of a midwestern bar. The place was packed, but it had the classic accoutrement. Neon signs, sexy posters, rigged gambling machines, the whole nine yards.



The place was musty but clean. Shockingly so. The floor looked freshly polished and mopped. At the time, I regretted not taking my allergy medication in the morning because I could already feel the incessant itch begin in the back of my throat. Weird since I didn't see any dust. I made my way to the only free spot at the bar, which was immediately attended to by the lone bartender. She was no older than 30, blonde, personable, and absolutely gorgeous. She almost glowed in comparison to everyone else in the bar. I'm really not one to flirt, but I thought I could at least get some small talk in before my drink. 



She told me that shots were only a dollar on Fridays, so I took 2 bills out and told her to grab one for each of us. I thought I just overreached because she gave me a toothy grin that was not-too-obviously hiding a scowl. 



She came back with 2 shots and a glass of ice. Pouring both shots into the cup she says, “I've had plenty.” She didn't even take the money.



I really wanted to ask about the place. Having worked in customer service I thought I would have at least heard about it, especially in such close proximity to work. it didn't help that I couldn't recognize anyone. None of my customers, colleagues, or friends were there to help me if anything went wrong. It’s pretty uncommon to enter a bar and not recognize anyone, especially in these little Midwest towns where everybody knows everybody. I started feeling worried.



Thankfully I was graciously bestowed a beverage to cool the nerves… And I was so grateful. I swirl the drink around the ice as I can feel my allergies flaring up again. I hoped taking a drink would have soothed the itch. Holding the glass up to my lips, tragedy strikes. I sneezed directly into my drink. Liquid covers my face and spills onto my work shirt. 



I sit and stew in embarrassment for a minute. Then I breathe out a quiet, “Man… Thankfully I don't work tomorrow!” I thought I made a sly recovery as I looked at the pretty bartender. The look on her face was a shocked horror as she looked at the spill up and down. 



She quickly ran out from behind the bar, only a notch below a run. “Oh god! Oh shit- let me get that cleaned up for ya!” She says rushing me down with a towel. Before I could even take the rag from her hand and say thank you, she began to frantically wipe down my face. 



“Oka- wait sto- wh-” I could barely get my words out, spitting the hairs of the cloth from my mouth. “Alri- Okay thank y- THANK YOU!” I yell at her as I rip the towel from her hands. I just glared at her hoping she would understand the overstep she just took. 



She pauses and takes another look at my shirt before racing behind the bar. She shuffles a bit before, “Here! Here! Here!” She yells in a panic, running around the bar again with a new shirt. “Take that one off and put this on instead! We can wash that one here!” 



“I’ll be alright.” I say with obvious annoyance in my voice. I began to check my belongings to make a swift exit, but something stopped me in my tracks. It took me a second to notice. The silence. It was deafening. My ears ring in the stagnant bar. That is when I turned around and saw  the bar patrons. All stood where they were, all slowly standing up, and all looking directly into my eyes as if I had made a mistake.



Before I could react, the bartender was on me. Grabbing at my clothes trying to get them off, she screams, “TAKE THAT SHIRT OFF! JUST GIVE ME THE FUCKING SHIRT. PLEASE JUST LET ME-” She was relentless trying to pry the shirt from my skin. I truly believed she was gonna just rip it off. 



I'm not proud of my action, but I was sufficiently scared so I punched her in the face. The bartender reeled back, checking her nose for blood before looking up. I could barely make out a soft, “Shit,” force its way up out of her mouth. 



I was frozen. Terror and guilt locked me into place. When faced with danger, humans have a natural response of fight or flight. Not many mention that freezing is just as natural.



It was then that I was broken free from my panic. The sound I heard above me was truly something I cannot describe. No amount of detail will ever be able to explain it in its actuality, but I can try. 



I thought someone was moving furniture for a second. It was a loud rumble moving from the other side of the bar towards me. There was an incredible weight above us and it was moving. As it grew louder in its approach, I could hear a slight fleshy squelching under the rumble. It was like someone was dragging a burlap sack full of cinder blocks and viscera across the floor above me. Even that doesn't do it justice. Before I knew it I was in a dead sprint out of the bar. I wish I could have gotten some answers, but it just wasn't worth my life. For some reason, I am convinced that if I would have stayed any longer, I never would have left.



Before I crashed my way into the driver's seat of my car, I took one last look up at the bar. The main floor’s lights were on now. I couldn't see anything inside of any of them. In fact, I couldn't even see light coming from one of them. I squinted to see if I could satiate the curiosity that burned inside me. I couldn't see anything until a massive shadow moved out of the way from the window. Like a boulder rolling to the side to reveal the entrance of a cavern. I wish I could have sped out of there, but the snow slowed my escape. Nothing came after me, nobody ran out of the bar, and I just drove off. 



I turned my music up as loud as I could. It's cowardly, but I just wanted to pretend that nothing happened. Distracting myself and putting all of my focus on the lyrics. It was only when I turned off of the back road that I noticed a stench. It was sour and hot. Somewhere between the smell of vomit and sulfur. The only excuse I had was that something died nearby, but the smell didn't leave. My car was so dark I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. It wasn't until I made it home to my bathroom that I discovered the source. My shirt looked like someone spilled crude oil on it. The stain was so dark and I could see smudges all over my face. They were dark green and barely washed off. It smelled so bad. You know the feeling you get when you are about to throw up? The cold sweat as if all of your blood fell down to your feet? That was a good reminder for me.



I would've showered all night if I didn't run out of hot water.



I put the shirt in a plastic bag and tied it up. The smell was so bad I'm just gonna throw it away. I was gonna keep it and show it to the cops, but I don't think that's an option anymore. I dialed the non-emergency line for the town closest to the bar hoping to get someone over there. 



“>!**PLEASE HELP HER**!< County Police Department” a gruff sounding man answered the phone.



“Hey, sorry to bother so late, but I was attacked by some staff at a bar. It's outside of town so I'm not sure about jurisdiction or whatnot, but this feels bad enough to report.” 



He was quiet for a moment. “That shouldn't be a problem. Where are you now?” 



“Home. This happened a little over 3 hours ago.”



“Ooookay?” He replied in a confused tone. I guess it is weird that I didn't call right away. “Do you have an address for the place?”



“No, just a name. Red Lake Tavern. It's on County Road J.” 



“Hm… One second please.” I could hear him set the phone down and begin typing on his keyboard. He paused… Typed again… paused… clicked his mouse a couple times. Then responded with exactly what I didn't want to hear, “I'm not seeing a Red Lake Tavern… I'm not seeing… Any businesses on this road in fact. Are you sure you have the right ro-”



I hung up. What was I going to say after that? I was going to start writing a testimony at least. Maybe I can report it in person after I get some pictures of the place.



That's when I found the rave reviews already sitting as unnamed documents in my Drive. One thing after another signaling me that I'm on my own. If I show this to anyone I know, I'll be put in a ward or rehab. 



So I'm here now. I was going to just post this as a warning, but I can't leave it like this. I have so many questions I just cannot leave unanswered. That's why I'm going back tomorrow. It's stupid, I am well aware, but I'm not going to be stupid. I'll go during the day, I'll bring protection, and I'll report back. 



\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



It's the next day. I would like to start this by saying that I am safe. I'm writing this in a hospital bed, but I am safe. 



Where do I even start?



I went back, obviously. After work, on a rare morning shift, I stopped at a pawn shop and picked up a small old fashioned snub nose revolver. It was really cheap and so was the ammo. I know now it's because it might as well be a nerf gun. He said “long rifle” ammo so I just assumed it would be good. I'm not really a gun guy. I told him that I really didn't intend to use it so I didn't care. The fear of God is more powerful than any caliber, but God wasn’t here today.



The sky was clear and the sun warmed the snow. Roads were in perfect speeding conditions for an easy drive. It's kind of jarring how beautiful the scenery was. The sun's rays shone down like a spotlight upon the run down bar… But it was so different. The building looked the same, but that was about it. There were no lights on and there was no sign. It was just a house. There were tons of cars still randomly placed around the gravel clearing beside it. Rusted and inoperable. There was absolutely no indication that anyone had even touched the place in years besides the open door to the basement that held the bar… or what was the bar. 



I started to panic. I've never truly questioned my own sanity up until now. The only thing that kept me from losing it was the thought ‘if I'm having a mental breakdown, I shouldn't have this’ as I loaded 8 tiny cartridges into the cylinder. The idea that I was cognizant enough to recognize the danger of having a firearm was more than able to snap me back to reality. I knew there was a bar there, and I knew I had been there on multiple occasions even if I didn't remember



Even still, if the door wasn't open I probably would have left. I probably should have. Honestly, I was beginning to question what I was even looking to accomplish. I left the first time thinking ‘answers aren't worth my life’. Then I remembered that it wasn't the first time. Months of time robbed from me. This was personal and no one was going to help me. 



The open door was an invitation onto the bar floor and I humbly accepted. I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I wasn't too surprised to see an abandoned tavern. Mud caked the floor, tables were covered in dust, and a large family of spiders decided to call this sore sight a home. Broken glass poured from the screens of the slot machines that were now pushed over and looted. There were no chairs upright except for one. A single stool standing lonely in front of the bar. 



The bar itself was about as I remember. Well kept, well dusted, and well stocked. Stepping behind the bar, I could tell someone had been here recently. There were bottles open and rags left everywhere. I made the mistake of looking inside the bottle and, to my horror, it was filled with that dark bile. All other bottles contained it, too. 



For my sake, I decided to not think of the implication those bottles entailed and made my way to the back rooms. It was just a hallway with a couple of doors. There was a closet filled with old clothes, a disgusting bathroom (I was certainly correct about the lack of plumbing), and one final door that opened up to a staircase. I've been moving quietly before, but now I was silent. I could tell the stairs were creaky, but my light steps were enough to not cause any sound. Thank god I was quiet. 



It felt like it took hours to hike up 13 whole stairs. Details will be more detailed from here on as this moment will forever be seared into my mind. The first thing I noticed at the top was the smell. It smelled like shit. Like the actual feces of someone with severe lactose intolerance living in this State. Then I heard a sound that I hate to even describe. It sounded like a giant mouth slowly swishing around a thick liquid. Emphasis on giant as it sounded huge. As I listened, I worried that my gun might not be as helpful as I thought, but I readied it all the same. 



I waited for the squishing to stop before I slowly began to open the door. The smell intensified to the point that it burned my nostrils. The door didn't make a sound as it moved out of the way, creating a panoramic effect. From right to left. 



At first I saw what looked like a stable with no hay. Troughs lined the walls that were crudely fastened to the walls with tape and nails. They were stained in deep shades of dried brown and maroon. A dark green trail has been left in front of the troughs. I braced as I swung the door open a little more. Then I saw the bartender. She was wearing the same clothes as last night, now stained with the same liquid that now stained my work shirt. It was the same woman now horribly thin and sickly. I felt so sad watching her struggle to carry a heavy bucket up to one of the troughs. My sorrow quickly turned to disgust as I examined what plopped out of the bucket. It looked like wet coffee grounds mixed with liquid excrement. The sound was so unforgettable at the time, yet I have forgotten. What I saw as the door was fully ajar made the audible slap of shit into a trough sound like a summer’s breeze.



I apologize in advance.



I thought it was a horrendously obese naked man at first, but it was far too big. It looked like a large fatty tumor with random patches of hair. Its light flesh colored skin was covered in large red pustules that oozed a dark green liquid. Its loose skin draped over the ground like a curtain and dragged behind. It was huddled over a trough. Its arms were long and remarkably thin with large fleshy oven mitts for hands. It scooped up piles of bloody diarrhea and shoveled it down its “mouth” like it was loading a musket. It looked more akin to a prolapsed anus than a mouth. It pushed in and out with every scoop. I couldn’t see any eyes, ears, or a nose. Just a hole at the front of the mass. I stood frozen as it began to stretch upward. Like the hole was the front of an elephant's trunk, it slowly moved up towards the ceiling. The skin lifted with it, revealing the stain it has left on the ground. Under everything, I saw a pair of human feet jutting out of a large fold, crushed and deformed under the weight. It began moving up and down, making that horrible swishing sound again. Its skin draping over the ground, lifting up, draping down, again, and again, and again. 



I don't know how long I stood there. In reality it was probably only a few seconds, but it felt like days before I threw up. Blood and bile dribbled on my shirt, my stifled gagging alerting the bartender. The girl looked horrified, as if a stranger had just entered her home carrying a gun. Her scream was so weak that it was closer to a deep grumble, but it managed to get the attention of the mass. Its hole swung around to meet my gaze. No eyes to see or be seen, but it looked at me and… blinked. Before I could turn around and run, the room was filled with people, grabbing at me and holding me in place. They were screaming louder than the very pits of hell. A symphony crying out in agony, despair, and rage. All at once. I went to cover my ears, but one of the faceless faces forced my arm down which threw the gun towards the bartender. As I struggled against the crowd I noticed her scramble for the gun, completely unphased by the people surrounding us. The mass kept blinking at me as more vomit climbed out from the depths of my insides. I was completely frozen.



The sickly woman attempted to get the gun, but she was so weak. She eventually fell to the ground next to the pistol and grabbed it. I still couldn't help but feel sorry for her as she struggled to aim the pistol at me. She was lying on her side and staring at me with eyes that screamed, “I didn’t want any of this.”



I didn't even hear the gun go off. The gun barely kicked out of her weak grip. To be honest it didn't hurt at all… Then I opened my eyes.



Everyone was gone. The bartender had switched her sights onto the creature. A small hole now punched through its trunk. Green slime, blood, and residual diarrhea poured out from the wound, but it didn't react. It swung its mouth to look at her... then back at me… then back at her which is where it stayed. I scooped the disgustingly light woman into my arms and booked it. 



I wasted no time sprinting down the stairs I came from. Down the stairs, to the end of the hallway, past the bar, and out the door. Olympic speed. I felt no desire to look back and I don't think she did either



Carefully, I layed her into the back of my car, hopped into the driver's seat, and sped off towards a hospital. On the way I could hear sobs and whimpers coming from behind me.



“I’m… So sorry… I’m sorry… You didn’t deserve this… None of you did…” She choked out in between tears and labored breaths. I sat quietly for a moment. None of you? Before I could ask anything further she started coughing up bile and blood, but far more than I did moments before. She was in very bad shape.



I reached back to take her hand and simply said, “Neither did you.” That was exactly what she wanted to hear. She held onto me for the rest of the drive. 



So, here I am now. Hospital Staff took her out in a stretcher and took me to a bed where they started asking the usual questions about my health. I told them to wait until the police arrived to ask questions. I will not be getting committed today.



The police didn’t even ask for a statement. I just told them everything. Amazingly they didn't look at me like an asylum escapee, but with shock. Like I just whispered their deepest darkest secret in their ears. They all left except for one who went to go find the bartender. I still don’t know what happened to her or if she's okay, but the feeling I got from holding her hand makes me think that is the last hand she will ever hold. 



I just got out of a CT scan. The doctors were just as shocked as the cops. They told me that the walls of my stomach and intestines were dangerously thin. As if something had been corroding them from the inside. Apparently I'm also pretty malnourished and dehydrated, but I've always been pretty scrawny so I didn't even notice. I'm guessing I'll be here for a while even though I feel completely fine. 



The cops aren't back yet, but I'm more focused on getting this out. If they tell me anything I'll update here. I just want people to see this and seriously heed my warning.



Don't go to random bars alone. If you do, let someone know where you are; and if something seems off, it very well could be. 



And if you see a bar called The Red Lake Tavern on the side of a county road, just keep driving.

1lla3da,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1lla3da/should_i_27f_almost_28f_stay_in_a_relationship/,"should I (27F, almost 28F) stay in a relationship that has toxic qualities but is overall good and healthy? dating at this age seems bleak.","boyfriend is 29M. 

Pros: 
- he remembers details about me, he knows what i won't like socially and can kind of read my mind, like ""there's a big group of people that way so walk around the other way"", he remembers my favorite foods and stuff. he can be really caring at times like offering me tea or medicine when sick, rubbing my back, massages. 

- sex life is 80-90% there. it leaves some to be desired but he is good at most of the stuff, but in general doesn't like to eat out. after bringing this up many times he now initiates a little more, but it's still unequal. i also love DT and didn't realize this until i was older because I grew up with so much shame around sex - and even though he's trying, he just can't really deliver. he doesn't have the confidence i don't think. but we are working on it. i also noticed he doesn't seem super concerned if i don't finish. he def won't make me finish first by eating out or if he can't hold it that's pretty much it. he won't try to satisfy me later. 

- although I am now ""normal"" after years of therapy, he stuck by me and is supportive of the family abuse I experienced. I grew up with an emotionally unwell mother, and he has dealt with the affects. in college I was even physical at one point which I highly regret. though I barely speak to my family about him now, he is supportive when I had to distance myself from them, and he even acknowledges my abuse. it was very hard to get there though - he wasn't familiar with what growing up with an abusive parent was like. 

- financial: he supported me when i was unemployed and when he wanted to go on a vacation he paid for me to go with him, he generally pays for all meals 

- overall political views: kind of match, he thinks well about all women, even dated an on older one long long ago. isn't misogynistic. 

cons:
- says some really jarring red flag things; said that if i want to be a SAHM and he pays the mortgage entirely that he doesn't want my name on the house. i asked him what if i have and care for all of our kids, then i am left with nothing? he said if i really wanted kids i wouldnt be transactional like this. share your thoughts. 

- marriage: despite the above, if we get married, he wants me to take his last name and not hyphenate. 

- not a great listener or initiator, we live with his in laws so i clean up after dinner every night even if i didn't cook. if i say i'm tired and don't want to clean after i ate what they cooked, he will just say sorry. if i say im really hungry but dont want to cook, and he's distracted by his phone or whatever, he will just again say sorry. sometimes if i have a stomach ache he'll offer to make me tea, but he doesn't go above and beyond. if i have period pain and im laying in bed he doesn't offer or do anything extra. idk if it's too much to expect but it would be nice if some periods he brought me snacks or offers to bring me stuff in bed - but maybe that's rare.

-- in addition to the above, i cried heavily on the phone one day and when he got home an hour late he didn't 
even acknowledge me. i nicely told him next time if i cry or im really sad i need you to check in on me when you get home. he said i cry a lot but i really don't, not like that. that was after a friend really hurt me. 

- He’s manipulative in arguments. We’ve had this ongoing issue with sleep—he snoozes his alarm 7 times, stays up late watching TV, and I hate having a TV in the bedroom. Before moving in, I’d go to bed at 10 and read. He says my preferences are crazy and has called me annoying for wanting no TV in the room. Maybe he's right, but in my ideal world, we’d watch in the living room or not every night, and go to bed by 10-11 on work nights. He says blue light or snoozing doesn’t matter because he feels fine, but I don’t—I’m always tired. He dismisses that and says it wouldn’t help me anyway. Then he gets extreme: “I’ll set an alarm for 6 am,” or “other men get up at 5,” or “I’ll use the Google alarm again that you hated.” He says he’s always compromising, but I feel like I am. I’ve told him that. We’ve been arguing about sleep for months.

- we are not similarily motivated or enjoy a lot of the same things. he loves the outdoors, i kind of like them. my ideal saturday is getting up earlier sometimes to go to the market and get coffee and pastures. he's anti caffeine on weekends and doesn't get the joy of it sometimes. he's not a big beach person, i am. 

so i know what you're thinking? with all these cons why not leave? well...

- although I'm trying to work on this, I do feel like the majority of men around my age group would prefer someone mid to late 20s and I'm going to be 28 in October. I feel like my peak years of dating are already passed or coming to an end and I'm super nervous about dating with the late 20s or early 30s crowd as there seems to be so many divorces. i am sorry to say this but like many I really do not want to date someone who already established a family and kids with someone else.

- I said above he's not all bad. I would say it's major really good but his red flags are jarring to me, but I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts.",1,1750968150.0,makemychoice,1,1.0,False

for context, a girl just a few years older than me lowk catfished me with a great first year uni internship offer today - she was actually just trying to recruit me into a pyramid scheme.

fortunately, i’m not completely deranged, so i realised during the meeting and after it ended, immediately told her that i wasn’t interested in anything to do with it.

she told me she understood, but, within the same message, asked me if i wanted to become friends and get coffee sometime in october, since she liked me as a person. (we had never met before the meeting btw)

i thought about it and told myself she’d probably use it as an excuse to try to drag me into it again. So i said she seemed really nice, but since i’m uncomfortable with the idea of her bringing up the topic again, i politely decline and would rather we go our separate ways. 

she replied that “that was not her intention at all, but sure, she gets it.” and seemed quite annoyed (or insulted maybe?) by it. Since then i’ve been feeling like *reaaaaly* bad about saying no. I keep telling myself that there was probably some manipulation behind the message, but what if there wasnt?? and i just rejected this poor girl who genuinely seemed nice (except the whole ponzi scheme thing) and wanted to make a new friend 🤧

Confession is: I think I might’ve been better off a single dad or completely alone. 

I love my wife. She’s my best friend, biggest supporter, and most annoying person I know. We aren’t perfect. We got married fast and had kids soon after and have been together now for over half a decade. We have issues like everyone else;  we are in couples counseling to get better at communicating and work through issues we’ve struggled to understand in the past. It’s going very well and we’ve discovered a lot about each other in a short time. But we recently got into a really intense argument/ fight. We never yell or insult each other but we couldn’t get past each other’s views on this one. After a couple days of no resolve, she took the kids on a mini vacation because she didn’t want to stay depressed at home- her words. I was hurt at first. Scared because I’ve never been so far away from the kids but also because I didn’t know what life was like without them. The thought of divorce and dual custody was terrifying. Coming home to an empty house wasn’t something I ever wanted. But after the first day, I got so much done around the house, got such a good amount of uninterrupted rest that I felt refreshed without coffee, spent time with myself without worrying about bedtime routines and being home/ finishing tasks as fast as possible to help with the kids. Granted, I know this isn’t the case with single parenting. We’ve been in places where we both have had to work opposite schedules and would pass the care back and forth without ever really seeing each other. So there’s an idea of what it would be like. Maybe? Funny enough, the kids behave better when it’s just me and I get a lot less upset with them when it’s just us but that might just be a bias perspective.
It’s been both refreshing and lonely. I noticed that I wasn’t as depressed, sad, or anxious as I thought I would be. I missed my kids every moment they were gone, but when I thought of my wife, I didn’t feel the same. I don’t really know if I was even all that upset. I missed her, of course. Her banter, her hugs, her kisses and pain in the ass-ery. But I came to the conclusion that maybe I don’t need her like I thought. I want my kids always around me. But if we were to get a divorce and have a co-parenting situation, I don’t think I would… care? Or I wouldn’t be as hopeless and depressed as I always thought I would be when we ever threw the idea of separation around. It’s come upa couple times early into our marriage; not an uncommon thing for fresh couples, I hope. I would shake and feel such a sense of panic and sadness at the thought of my wife and kids not being home when I get back, not waking up to her every morning or seeing her in the evening and having to put them through the process. I should add that I don’t want to divorce her or separate. I want to stay married because I do truly love her. But after this spontaneous vacation and my time alone, I think I like it more being alone than being with her as a married couple. ",2,1750968067.0,confession,4,1.0,False
1ll9z16,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIContentAutomators/comments/1ll9z16/stop_showing_your_face_faceless_growth_is_here/,Stop Showing Your Face! Faceless Growth is HERE (And Printing Money) 🤑,"**Stop Showing Your Face! Faceless Growth is HERE (And Printing Money) 🤑**

Okay, let's address the elephant in the digital room: *Do we really need to show our faces to make money online?* Because honestly, sometimes the thought of putting myself out there feels more terrifying than trying to pet a lion. 🦁 But guess what? Faceless growth is not just a trend; it’s a real thing, and it's printing money like a boss!

So, if you’re tired of making TikToks with the ""I just woke up"" face or constantly worrying about how your hair looks on Zoom calls, this post might just be the breath of fresh air you need. 

Here’s why you can stop showing your face and still crush it in the online zone:

### 1. **Content Over Personality**
   - Not every influencer needs to be a personality powerhouse. Sometimes, the richest content comes from *undercover* ops. Ever heard of documentary-style videos or blogs? They can be way more engaging!
   - Think about channels like **Kurzgesagt** or **CGP Grey**—these creators avoid showing their faces entirely but still pull in millions of views!

### 2. **Unlimited Creativity!**
   - Faceless content allows you to let your creativity soar without the pressure of personal branding. 
   - You can experiment with animations, voice-overs, or even quirky stock videos. Plus, who doesn’t love a good meme? 😜

### 3. **Get Comfortable with Your Skills**
   - Focus on what you're good at! Is it writing? Voice-over? Editing? Perfect those skills and leverage them without worrying about your camera presence.
   - The beauty of faceless growth is that you can genuinely create what you love without feeling self-conscious.

### 4. **Monetization is Just a Click Away**
   - Whether it’s through affiliate marketing, sponsored content, or selling digital products, your faceless creations can still generate income.
   - Want a handy guide to figure out how to do this effortlessly? This program could be the game-changer for you! Check it out [here](https://whop.com/howtoai/?a=liveitupdeals) 🔗.

### 5. **No More ‘Camera Ready’ Stress**
   - Let’s be real, not everyone wakes up looking like they just walked off a magazine cover every single day. 😉 Faceless growth means you can work in your PJs, hair in a bun, and enjoy a cup of coffee without a care in the world!
   - Plus, you can even work from your couch or in your favorite café—who needs the whole influencer aesthetic when you’ve got delicious caffeine?

Let’s be honest, stepping away from face-time (pun totally intended) opens up exciting possibilities. Are you ready to embrace faceless growth and potentially find your golden ticket in the digital world without showing your face? 

Okay, maybe there’s *a little* pressure—like, the pressure to create killer content. But remember, there’s a whole community out there rooting for you and just waiting to share their own faceless success stories! 

So, what do you think? Are you ready to hit the ground running sans face? Let’s share ideas and support each other in becoming faceless content kings and queens. Excited to hear your thoughts! 🎉",1,1750967870.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1ll9xi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1ll9xi9/a_chill_noreastern/,A Chill Nor'Eastern," I was cold. I'm not sure if that word even comes close to where I was at that time, suffice to say that the signs of hypothermia kept running like a pilots checklist through my brain. 

 


In the last couple of days, the only relief I had from the below freezing temperatures was the brief moments spent in the convenience store where I went for my daily constitutional. Even then I didn't get enough time to fully thaw out.
 
 


Every joint in my body seemed to be freezing in place. No matter how I bent my legs or moved my arms, as soon as they were motionless for more than thirty seconds, they became steadily more resistant to motion, and it seemed to me that it wouldn't be too much longer and I wouldn't have the energy to overcome the resistance any more. At times, I thought that I could feel the presence of dooms hand just waiting for my body to give up this fight. 
 
 


Body found under the Third Street bridge would read the little paragraph if my death would even merit that much. 
 
 

My mind toggled between welcoming the inevitable and the relief it would bring from the pain and anguish that was still fresh and constantly searing itself deeper and deeper into my soul, and then back to the innate drive to survive that even a virus carried in it's DNA. 
 
 


It would be so easy to just let go of the struggle and slip off into sleep and never wake up again. No more hurt, frustration, or tears, just sleep. Possibly the best sleep that a human can experience. 

 


I was still at the point where the thought of never seeing my son, never being able to make him laugh or hear him say, ""Dad, I just love you so much!"" would double me over in a pain so overwhelming that at times I released it by howling at the night sky like some wounded animal caught in a trap with no escape. If there was a god, I hated the son of a bitch.
 
 


I was living under a bridge, which usually gave some measure of relief from the wind, but not tonight. Mother Nature had done her geometry homework for this winter bluster, and the wind was coming in wave after wave at just the right angle that the bridge seemed to strengthen the cold blast, like the way squeezing the end of the hose made the waters exit pressure stronger. 

 


All the garbage that had accumulated over the years was blown to one side of my luxury estate where it built up against the chain link fence that was erected to keep people like me out. I thought back to the snow drift fences in Wichita and how they would be completely covered by the wind driven snow on the Great Plains. 
 
 


My sleeping bag now offered very little resistance to icy temperatures. The night before I had urinated all over myself in my sleep, and the bag was wet, nearly useless. 

 


My brain injury had managed to short circuit the signals sent from my bladder to my brain, which caused me more than once to be standing there talking to someone while the dark stain spread across my lap. I would be blithely unaware till I could feel my legs getting wet and cold. 

 


I woke up this morning soaked in urine, with nothing to change into. The day before, someone had come into my space and taken every piece of clothing I had except what I had on at the time of the robbery, so I had walked around all day covered and smelling of urine. 

 


But, thanks to my brain injury, I didn't think too much about it. Or, rather, I kept forgetting about it. In the unfortunate moments when it occurred or dawned on me that I was walking around covered in piss, the overwhelming feeling of worthlessness, shame, and despair was so strong that all I could do was sit somewhere by myself on a bench and hang my head. 

 


I was now an honest to God piece of walking shit. No one was going to give a man soaked in his own urine a pep talk. No hugs wouldn't be forthcoming. I couldn't figure out what to do about it, so I did nothing. I could feel myself slipping, becoming one of those people that others either humor, or attack. Insane.
 
 


I heard a gust of wind tear across the field beside me, so closing myself into a ball to minimize surface area I braced for the impact. When it hit me, I was positive it was gale force and it brought with it a world of painful cold.

 


My ears felt it first, burning to begin with, and then feeling like millions of needles were stabbing into them, all the way into the ear canal. 

 


Then my face, my chapped lips felt like the skin had just been ripped off, exposing the tender tissue below, and now cold working in concert with my dehydration had cemented my lips together. 

 


Although my hands had seemed to be burning constantly, at the same time a kind of pain radiated through them that I had never felt before, something as foreign as another planet, like a solar system had placed it there, and moving my fingers was now a monumental and agonizing task. My whole body shook and spasmed in defiance of the cold.
 
 


""Fuuuuuuccckkkkkkk!"". 
 
 


At the top of my lungs I let it go. In spite of being ultra noise conscious of the condominiums two hundred yards behind me, I couldn't help myself. But it was clear that even if they had the windows open, they wouldn't have heard me over the howling of the wind. 
 
 


The only way I would be able to save myself at this point would be to swing around the chain link fence that extended over the concrete wall with a nasty twenty foot fall to the cement spillway below. That fall was a guaranteed serious injury. It was a harsh punishment for not taking my entrance way seriously, or trying to come visiting while shitfaced drunk. 

 


I had already seen the physics of that scene play out, ending in two broken ankles and a collarbone. A death-defying trapeze act without the precaution of a net. I was positive that my hands would not be able to keep an adequate grip on the fence to hold my body weight. I couldn't even make a tight fist. 
 
 


If I were to somehow manage the swing around the fence, then I would have to navigate the obstacle course of hidden ditches and bare thorned briar bushes in the pitch black to get to the road for help. About a hundred yards of booby traps.
 
 


And, where would I go then? I probably hadn't heard three cars go over the bridge in the last hour and a half. If miraculously a car did come by, what's the chances they would have stopped for me? Who was going to let a nasty, pissed soaked piece of shit like me get in their vehicle? 

 


'You would rather die than go to the hospital like this' the voice of my shame was repeating to me, over and over again, until I guess I just accepted it as the rule. The Gods honest truth.
 
 


No. If I was going to choose life, then the battle would be fought right here, on my turf, my homefield advantage. Fuck getting help. I could do this better, easier on my own, with only me in command. I hated how you had to give up control of yourself at the hospital it seemed, and all too often to people that I was positive had cheated their way through medical school. 
 
 


I had no idea which way to go for help anyway. At that very time, I couldn't remember if it was left into town at the closest road, or if it was right. I had walked the path to the B.P. so many times I could do it asleep, but my brain injury had clearly chosen to spray my situation down with some good old fashioned confusion, just to make things a little sportier, I guessed.
 
 


So, the decision now was to fight, to rage against the dying of the light, and to do it right here in my own yard.
 
 


My watch read three am, about four more hours until the sun would cascade life over this part of the world, four more hours in the ring with Ali. Nothing to it. 

 


I come from a long line of tough motherfuckers. A grandfather who fought in the Pacific during World War Two, at the same time, halfway around the world, another fighting the Third Reich hoping to reach Berlin before the Red Tide. 

 


It occurred to me as a child, that due to time zones, there was an ancestor of mine fighting twenty four hours a day against the evil that you could read all about and still never grasp the depravity. 

 


I thought about my moms dad, over in Belgium during the Bulge, thirty below, inadequate winter clothes, gloves with holes, and two clips left for his M1 Garand, outnumbered a hundred to one, but standing defiantly for what was right. 

 


""Goddam, at least no one is shooting at me. Come on grandad, be with me.""
 
 


I was going to live. I was not going to be found dead under some bridge, my body just another piece of litter with all the rest of the trash. 
 
 


Nobody was going to find my piss covered carcass by following the foul stench carried to them on the breeze of a spring thaw.
 
 


My body was now in a constant state of spasm, uncontrollably shaking, and I could feel the soreness of muscles contracting over and over and I thought of Micheal J. Fox and found a laugh. An actual gut laugh. It made me feel stronger instantly. No matter what, I had to laugh. If I could laugh, then I was in control of this situation. Rarely do you hear the loser laughing, always the victor.
 
 


I tried to think of my folks. Tried to recall some family moment, maybe on vacation or some happy occasion, a time that can always be conjured to the mind to elicit a laugh at pauses of family reunion conversations. 

 


All I could think of was sitting in the backseat of my dads 1972 SuperBeetle on the way back to Tennessee from Kansas, where my sister was living the bad biker chick lifestyle. One of her lovers was an acid dealer, and he laid twenty hits of some really nice Sunshine on me, two of which I had dropped an hour before stopping at the store in a severe case of time mismanagement. 

 


My dad parked the car and asked me if I wanted to get out and go in for something, and I barely managed a ""no"" through my unabashed laughter at the mere idea. 

 


For the last fifteen minutes, my vocabulary had become uninhibited and Pops had called me down for dropping the f word so many times that he had become agitated, he absolutely hated that word and would not permit it. Something my mom thought was more and more comedic with every Coors she could put down. 

 


When Pops went into the store, I leaned up and said in her ear, ""You know what? Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck....."" nonstop until my father emerged from the store. By the time he got to the car, my mom had laughed so hard that she peed a little. 

 


My dads authoritative facade completely broke, and he joined in. A little bug with three people and a little black dog sitting in the parking lot of some small store somewhere in Arkansas laughing uncontrollably for half an hour at least. I laughed a little at the memory then looked at my watch. 
 
 


Shit! It was after four am now, three and a half hours before something close opened. I was becoming exhausted now from all the energy expended by the spasms, compounded by malnutrition and on the line of dehydration, my energy was draining fast. 

 


It started to look like this one may come down to a war of time attrition. ""Me and you tick tock. Let's do this,"" I said out loud to no one but myself.
 
 


I figured that now was as good of a time as any to try and put something out to the Universe, the Cosmic Karma, time to try and play 'Let's Make A Deal' with the hands of fate. 

 


""This is my word. If I make it to the other side of this, if I live through this night, I will make it off the streets and when I do, I will do anything in my power to help who I can. This is my word."" I figured since I said it with my best Dances With Wolves imitation that it would carry more weight, a concept that amused me and made me wonder if a Native American could overrule the prayer of a White Christian since the Native would be speaking straight to the big man. 

 


I've long regarded Nature as God. Fits the bill, and here I was having thoughts that would probably make Bible God mad if he was real. 

 


Then, the internal comedian of mine took the stage, thankfully he was hot tonight and I started rolling. It all of a sudden occurred to me that he only came out when I was in that space between semi-asleep and asleep . It just then occurred to me that I might be dead.
 
 


I snapped awake and was shivering all over, the intensity of the spasms were making my legs and arms hurt and burn. I could feel the coldness inside of me as if my bones were made of ice, cooling the meat covering. 

 


I had to get up and walk, and at this point, I wasn't sure if I could. My balance still wasn't perfect, and my legs hurt. Nonetheless, I managed to stand with the help of a pillar, then started to walk in place and turning around scanning the area. 

 


A large piece of cardboard had been blown against the outside of the fencing, effectively blocking the wind. I got my stuff and headed for it. Sitting down in the corner I found I was able to shift the cardboard with my fingers to its optimum position, then I piled everything I could find on top of me. 

 


I balled up underneath and shivered. I pictured me frozen solid all balled up, stuck to the frozen fence and some schmuck accidentally bumps the fence knocking the balled up frozen corpse of me loose, and I roll down the hill and into the spillway then clean out of sight. The more I tried to picture that, the funnier it got until some laughs busted loose.
 
 


By six, I could feel some warmth building back up so I decided to make my way to the store. This meant being fully exposed to the wind, which was showing signs of boredom now, like this gig ain't worth the energy. 
 
 


When I arrived at the station, it wasn't open yet, but the owner was already there and was getting all set up for opening that day when he saw me. He called to me as I was trying to find a place to block the wind, and I turned to see him standing in the front door motioning for me to come over there and into the store. 
 
 


""You don't look so good,"" he matter of fact told me. He was from Pakistan, and he spoke straight to the point. 
 
 


""Yeah. I don't feel so good either.""
 
 


""You look terrible.""
 
 


I could feel it coming, that gut laugh that you know there is no stopping.
 
 


""I will get the coffee going for you. You must get warm. Why did you pee in your pants?""
 
 


That was it. I bent in half laughing. As a big deal of a deal, those pants were yesterday, after last night, that seemed to be the least of my worries. 

 


Maybe it's all in perspective. 

 


And they say that your perspective tends to change when you feel the chill Nor'eastern blow.

He’s also 23. I’m really really struggling to decide what would be the best option here and feel incredibly lost. Any advice is really appreciated.

He’s a very loving man. He works immensely hard for me, is clearly very attracted to me (constantly bigs me up, supports me when my confidence is low etc) helps me in many many ways (helps relieve pain without asking if I’m visibly uncomfortable, gets me small snacks to show he’s thinking of me, shows he loves me by making me coffee constantly without asking etc). He clearly does value me and wants a future with me. This is something he talks about constantly and is clearly working towards so it’s not just false words. 

My very big issue is that I was raised in a very toxic family where shouting was very prevalent and so I’ve grown very averse to it. He’s grown in a good family, but he has been raised around shouting and rude words if that makes sense and thinks that worked for him. I’m very calm in arguments, whereas he swears quite a bit (“shut up, “fuck off”, “you’re talking shit” etc) which I absolutely cannot stand. He does always come round and speak maturely eventually and apologise but he can be quite dismissive in the sense that he sighs, goes on his phone (if he thinks the argument is silly). I’ve obviously brought this up loads and he’s said he doesn’t know why he does it and needs to stop but never manages. I don’t think it’s down to him not caring because he’s sorted out other issues in the past.

I feel very lost as I’m now changing because of this. I don’t know if I’m making a big deal of it and being ungrateful for someone who does a lot for me. It’s my first ever relationship so I’m struggling a lot as I’ve got nothing to compare it to. I’ll admit I’ve also changed from when we met and am not as nice as I used to be (busier life, loss of honeymoon feeling etc) but I do love him very much and see a future with him. I do know he loves me, but the way he speaks to me really hurts me

Planning to play on PotD upscaled with story companions. I generally like playing control characters in games that support them, reacting to what encounters bring rather than just going in with the same plan each time. I played through the first game with both a mage and a rogue who focused on scrolls and spell bound items and had a ball with both.

I have played both SC psion and SC bloodmage through to early Neketaka and need to choose one (or something else I suppose). I have enjoyed the psion more than I thought I would. Feels very much like I am trying to control a situation, almost always have something to do and have backup grenades when building focus, been thinking about modding Serafen to a debonaire just cause it seems to fit and seems like it would be fun. But, if the game just starts to throw tons of intellect immune enemies or the high level powers fall flat I could see it getting dull just spamming mental binding, secret horrors and soul shock over and over again. 

The bloodmage just seems much more straightforwardly powerful, to the point where I am concerned that it can just run over every encounter with the same plan of group the enemies on the tank, slicken, chillfog, combusting wounds drink coffee... maybe start to use pull of eora to save Eder some black eyes.

  
Is either one head and shoulders more fun later in the game? Or am I missing a something else that fits the bill better. 

  
Thanks!

We recently had a user post asking for ideas on how to make their already ""decent"" living room feel ""more lively,"" specifically looking for wall decor, side furniture, and accent chair suggestions. They had a great foundation with their existing green sectional and a beautiful rug.

We took on the challenge with Style Blast AI, focusing on enhancing the space's vibrancy and adding key elements to complete the look.

**Here's what Style Blast AI did to transform the room:**

* **Vibrant Wall Gallery:** The AI replaced the smaller, scattered comic book art with a cohesive and lively gallery wall featuring abstract, colorful pieces. This instantly became a focal point, injecting energy and modern flair into the room. The art was carefully selected to complement the existing rug's warm tones and the sofa's green hue, creating a harmonious palette.
* **Inviting Accent Chair:** To address the need for an accent chair, our AI introduced a stylish, burnt orange armchair. This piece not only provides additional seating but also adds a fantastic pop of contrasting color, echoing the warm tones in the rug and tying the space together.
* **Thoughtful Side Furniture:** A small, elegant round side table was placed next to the new accent chair, perfect for holding a lamp and creating a cozy reading nook. This adds functionality without cluttering the space.
* **Refined Decor & Lighting:** Subtle changes like a more modern table lamp and simplified decor on the coffee table contribute to a cleaner, more sophisticated aesthetic. Even the throw pillows were updated to match the new color scheme.
* **Optimized Sofa Configuration:** While keeping the core sofa, the AI suggested a more streamlined configuration, opening up the space slightly and allowing the new elements to shine.

**Before:**

I politely told him I was going to head home. He seemed kind of annoyed and acted like I was being cold for not wanting to sit out there and keep the date going.

\*Started to come to lunch with our team every times he was in the office.   
\*He always comes to coffee with our team after the lunch.  
\*He always listens when i speak, like he really wants to listen what I say.  
\*He always laughs at my jokes, also in group chat.  
\*He have noted multiple times at lunch that he is single, noting he has baby names in mind for future, that his car is big enough for future kids etc. Nobody asked about these things, he just say this things all the time I'm around.   
\*He looks at me with these soft eyes. I swear I can see it in his eyes. Its like we talk through eyes.  
\*He often uses my name.  
\*He always points his legs looking at me when he is more far from me.  
\*He gave me a lift home one time after workout (although at first he offered to drop me somewhere on the way), but then asked if i really though he would drop me off on half way.  
\*He shared personal things when he gave me a lift.  
\*We always lock eyes when I walk into a room and he is in this room. It feels like he waits for me to show up and always notices me right away.  
\*One time I was teasing him and after i texted to ask him if he was mad, he assured me that he didn't and said he isn't like that to get mad and added smiley face:).  
\*After at work he stood very close to me (I could almost feel his body) and asked again why I though he got mad and reassured he didn't.  
\*After that he again stood very close to me and talked to me, so I could again feel his body next to me.   
\*He initiates conversations with me more and more every time we see at work and get physically closer.

I'm not sure if it's as bad as I remember it being, but I'm sure someone will get a kick out of it.

So it was 2017, I had just started at a new uni, and I didn't know anyone. I had taken a gap year so I was a 20 year old second-year, rooming with a bunch of freshmen who had just left high school, and it was really isolating. One of my mutuals on the site formerly known as twitter posted about looking for new members for their campaign. I had never played before, but had wanted to for a long while now. The mutual (let's call them M) specified in their post that they were in the middle of a long game (level 10 \[!\]) and it was an 18+ group. Slay!

So I joined the group! The players who were already there and had been with the game since the start were M, a soft spoken guy, and the DM. There was one other newbie (N), and we decided that our characters would have a romantic history so that we could gel into the story a bit more. Before our first session, we were all just chatting and hanging out in Discord. I had just started a new job as a barista and was making some off-color jokes about how every part of me smelled like coffee. M wound up deleting that message and spoke to me privately, saying it was inappropriate. Totally fair, I apologized. It was somewhere around here that I found out that N was only 17. Okay that threw me off. I think they were only a couple months out from turning 18, but it was still weird to me. But I let it slide since the DM and the rest didn't seem to mind. Again, our characters were former lovers. So I was put in a very awkward situation where if my character pursued her lingering feelings for him (which was my original intention) I would be hitting on a teenager. Weird and bad, all around.

Anyway when we actually start playing, everyone is super patient and chill with N and I. We're both new to the game, and I want to make it clear that as DnD mentors, these guys were great! I was playing a cleric, and they explained the rules so well that it's still my favorite class to play. I just GET the spell system. The issue started when I realized the DM was spending a lot of time on M and their character. Obviously, they were here from the start so they have more stuff to do. But at one point, there was a scene of M's character talking to an NPC privately so I muted my mic until I was needed back. I kid you not they went on for an hour and a half. I even messaged N and E like what the heck is going on???

So here's where I turn into the asshole. Over time it became really clear that M was the main character of this game. One specific example I can think of is that early on, N's character found a big ol' creature egg. They carried it around for multiple sessions, we had a running bit about their character keeping it in a BabyBjorn. But nothing they did to try to hatch it worked. So I think we assumed it would just take time. A few sessions later, M's character also finds an egg. They also try to hatch it and whatever their first try was IMMEDIATELY worked and M got a little baby dragon companion. I can't speak to how N felt about this, but I was kind of peeved. Like sure, maybe N wasn't doing the specific thing that the DM wanted to hatch the egg and M was, but it just felt kind of mean after everything N did with their egg to just have M's hatch right away. Another time was when my character tried to convene with her goddess but I failed the roll so I couldn't speak with her. M's character had a special bond with at least one member of the Seldarine, and would chat with them at least once per session. I think it was 4 sessions before I even got a sign from Selûne that she was listening to her level ten disciple. It was little things like that.

So I was building up resentment and couldn't just communicate it like a normal person, so my in-game character started getting MEAN. She made a lot of snide comments about M's character, and began isolating herself from the group. This all culminated with a rival goddess seemingly trying to poach my character. In one of the only times I got any one-on-one roleplay in this game, my character found herself in front of a dark portal and heard a voice telling her to join her. I figured, fuck it. Part of me was even thinking that if M can survive all the bullshit they try, maybe the DM is setting up something fun for me. So I stepped into the portal. N's character saw this happen, and chased after mine. We both insta-died. No saving roll, no anything. I was upset, actually crying for real. It was not pretty. It just felt really unfair. Especially since my little bitch fit led to N losing their character, too. A month later, the DM let us roll to save our characters and we both managed to survive. But as soon as our characters returned to camp, M's character kind of ignored us and went about playing with their baby dragon. As if our characters didn't even really matter. At one point, we entered a city and a guard started flirting with my character. They introduced themselves and the guard's name was MY NAME IRL. That felt like a pointed dig and it really hurt my feelings.

I will be the first to admit, I got WAY too attached to my character. So any slight against her felt like a slight against me. So I understand why the rest of the group probably wanted me gone. I think we had one or two more sessions after N and I's characters came back, and then the DM messaged me saying they were putting the game on an indefinite hiatus. I'm almost positive that they just booted me and kept going with the game, and were trying to spare my feelings. Ever since, I've only ever DMed, never been a player. It was just a weird, bad time. And I fear I am someone else's horror story.",2,1750966887.0,rpghorrorstories,1,1.0,False
1ll9jhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1ll9jhc/mysterious_man_with_a_wine_castle_north_of_milan/,Mysterious man with a wine castle north of Milan,"In my 20s I applied for a job at a Swedish-owned bed and breakfast north of Milan in Italy (i live in sweden). I didnt know any Italian and had close to no experience in the field so i thought i wouldnt even get a reply. 

Unexpectedly I got a call from a man who had seen my application and wanted to meet me for an interview. The man told me he knew the owners, a couple of swedes, but i never got to meet or talk to them, he always spoke on their behalf. Looking back i have no idea what his title was, if any, and he never told how he knew the owners. 

We met at a semi-fancy bistro (his choise) in the city where I lived. He was in his 40s-50s, had a slick back hairstyle and to me he looked like a typical phone-seller with expensive clothes.

The interview was relaxed and he offered me a meal but i only wanted a coffee, he had pasta or something. I dont know if this is a usual conduct but i have never had an interview like this (in a restaurant beeing offered food) before or after this.

I was told that the job involved cleaning and taking care of three rooms where guests stayed. The rooms were located in a wine castle where the owners also lived (part-time they also had property in sweden), they also used this property to grow and make wine. I would stay for free in a nearby house on the castle grounds. I would be preparing breakfast for the guests and if someone ordered a picnic basket I would go and buy ingredients for it in the small village nearby, i would have access to a car that i could use freely. To me it sounded like a chill job with one day off a week, dont remember the salary tho. Since most of the guests were Swedish, no knowledge of Italian was required. 

Over all the man talked alot, many small details about the castle and the surrounding area. So much that at some point it felt like he was selling me something, not the other way around.
He didnt ask me that much as i remember. I also noted he had a laid back attitude towards starting dates, ”we’ll see when they want to start the rental season”, ”could be june, could be august hard to tell”. 

The man was optimistic and towards the end of the ”interview” he even said ""it's time for you to go and buy a Swedish-Italian dictionary!"". 

A few weeks went by and the man and I kept in touch via email and things seemed to be moving along, we were discussing dates for flights to italy by this point. Until suddenly one day I received an email saying that the couple who owned the castle suddenly decided to sell it. That was the last I heard from the man.  

I often think about this, thinking this could have been some sort of ”sliding doors”. What would have happened if I had gotten the job in Italy, what would my life have been like? 
And was this guy a scam, looking back i feel he showed signs of beeing a mythomania. Did he just want to get into my pants, me beeing 20 and he in hes 40s? Was there even an castle? Who were the owners of this wine castle north of Milan? 

And yes, I had already bought a swedish-italian dictionary, i still have it.

My parents have ran a “successful” coffee shop for years in Brooklyn and I’ve recently been working on a piece of software for them to implement “dynamic” pricing, since all the big players (Starbucks, La Colombe, etc) are starting to build their own solutions. They suggested I reach out to people in the industry to get some early feedback, figured this would be the perfect place to start :)

What I’m trying to do is build a solution that integrates with square and monitors prices, competitors, and market/supply chain changes that could possibly impact costs to always be “ahead” of these things. Prices don’t change in a given day, but rather over week-month long periods only for items that need it. So far we have been seeing a big bump in profitability and I was curious if anyone would be willing to check it out/provide some feedback.

Would love to hear what people think/if anyone would like to try it (for free of course) and give further feedback.

Disclaimer: This is just what worked for me, YMMV. Also this treatment only works if you continue to use it, every day without fail. You or your partner need to be consistent.

My regimen:
- Yasmin birth control (I take it as directed with the placebo break)
- 3-4g (I do 1 level teaspoon) myo-inositol powder mixed in my AM coffee
- 2,000iu vitamin D

That’s it! This cured my PMDD. I started sleeping better, lost so much inflammation in my body, no more feelings of rage, panic, dread, anxiety etc.

The usual advice of eat healthy drink water & exercise never helped until I began taking all this stuff. It just wasn’t enough.

In the time frame of curing my PMDD I have returned to school and work, began dating, reconnected with friends, exercising, cleaning up my life.

I’m still neurodivergent and no pill can cure this but I find ways to work with it in my daily life. PMDD however was a significant hindrance to absolutely every facet of my life & I’m glad to be rid of it.

Good luck & I really feel for you all!

Attorney General Alan Wilson is drawing clear battle lines — and he's starting in Nancy Mace's backyard.

On June 26, Wilson secured early endorsements from three Lowcountry sheriffs representing key Republican counties, sending a message to the GOP congresswoman and likely governor's race rival that Mace may hold the seat but the political turf isn't automatically hers.

Those endorsements came from Charleston Sheriff Carl Ritchie, Dorchester Sheriff Sam Richardson and Berkeley Sheriff Duane Lewis.

""Public safety is a core function of government, and that is why I'm making it a hallmark of my campaign,"" Wilson said inside Coastal Coffee Roasters, a local café in downtown Summerville. ""These three gentlemen standing up here with me today, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate what they've done.""

Among the most striking of the endorsements is Ritchie, the same sheriff who was on the ballot last fall when a [public clash broke out](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/mace-graziano-ice-immigration-sanctuary-sheriff/article_df6a492a-7aae-11ef-9858-1bac666184f3.html) between Mace and incumbent Charleston County Democratic Sheriff Kristin Graziano.

Since [Ritchie's win](https://www.postandcourier.com/politics/carl-ritchie-wins-charleston-county-sheriff-election/article_df0fb554-9148-11ef-937d-efd5ae9d9b59.html), Mace has repeatedly taken credit in the victory, saying she was responsible for ousting Charleston’s sheriff after accusing her of gutting immigration enforcement.

""When our lieutenant governor stood silent, when the attorney general did nothing against the illegals who are here, the cartels who are here, the gangs who are here, our state didn’t do anything, and I single-handedly ejected a sanctuary sheriff in Charleston County,"" Mace said recently ahead of a Richland County GOP meeting. 

Ritchie, who defeated Graziano by 3 percentage points, pushed back against Mace's claims in an interview with The Post and Courier.

""Everyone knows one person cannot single-handedly win an election,"" Ritchie said when asked about her comments and his decision to endorse Wilson early on.

""But to say 'single-handedly,' that is dismissing my hundreds of volunteers who knocked on doors for me, handed out literature, made phone calls,"" he said. ""That also dismisses and disrespects all the folks that voted for me. Almost 106,000 folks came out to vote for me.""

Mace has been teasing a run for governor for months. She is expected to formally announce her bid later this summer.

Her spokeswoman Sydney Long responded in a statement, saying in part that ""Everyone knows Nancy Mace exposed sanctuary sheriff Kristin Graziano.”

She added that the local media covered the sheriff's race closely, before challenging Wilson's recent alliances. ""Now find one statement, just one, from Alan Wilson or (Lt. Gov.) Pamela Evette last year backing her up as she fought to remove Graziano. You won’t. They were silent then, and they’re pretending now.""

In accepting the endorsements Wilson called Berkeley County Sheriff Lewis ""a superstar,"" and said he knew within five minutes of meeting Dorchester County's Sheriff Richardson when he was still a candidate that he was ""going to be my guy.""

Wilson also thanked Ritchie for taking him on a 1:30 a.m. ride-along a few months ago, and recalled being in the ""war room"" with him during a raid tied to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force.

""These guys are the tip of the spear,"" Wilson said, adding, ""Public safety is always going to be at the top of my list. If you don't feel safe, if you're not safe, nothing else matters.""

The endorsements offer an early glimpse of the kind of coalition Wilson is trying to build, one that is rooted in law-and-order politics and local alliances. More endorsements are expected to follow, Wilson's campaign confirmed.

Wilson also insisted this rollout was not about boxing out any would-be contender.

""I'm running for something, not against other people,"" he said. ""I'm here to stand with these men today to say that I've got your back."" 

Positions on immigration should continue to emerge as a factor in the GOP race as all the would-be candidates, including Mace, so far are seemingly in line with President Donald Trump and his enforcement crackdown.

Last week, while taking questions at a business networking event in Mount Pleasant, Mace shifted her language slightly when she referenced the significance of the Charleston County sheriff's race.

""Right here in Charleston County, we had a sanctuary sheriff. Say what you want about her, but in a blue county that Kamala (Harris) won, you, the voters, replaced her with a sheriff who believes the law and order,"" she said.

""You did that,"" Mace told the crowd.

Her congressional [campaign website](https://nancymace.org/issues/securing-our-border-a-new-era/#:~:text=Nancy%20singlehandedly%20led%20the%20charge%20to%20remove%20Charleston%27s%20Sanctuary%20Sheriff%2C%20Kristin%20Graziano%2C%20who%20failed%20to%20prosecute%20violent%20criminal%20illegal%20aliens.), which now features decidedly statewide issues, strikes a different tone. It reads: ""Nancy singlehandedly led the charge to remove Charleston's Sanctuary Sheriff, Kristin Graziano, who failed to prosecute violent criminal illegal aliens.""

Prologue

 In the summer of 1976, Darlene Chase found herself in downtown Norfolk being harassed by the federal prosecutor. The humidity was one of many things closing in on her, but she grit her teeth and rolled her eyes. They were at a stalemate. The unrelenting figure in the corner leaned against his desk with his arms folded. Watching her, trying to scare her, he had her trapped. He laid out pictures of her cavorting with the mob. She swallowed hard, but wasn’t about to give in. She could play this game and she could win. After all, Big Sal was waiting for her.

  Maybe he would have champagne waiting for her, she imagined, hoping to convince herself of his kindness, even though her memories said otherwise. After all, he *was* a mob boss. He promised her a life out of poverty. She wasn’t about to lose that and he knew that meant that her loyalty was his. Besides, this meeting was pointless. She might as well as go home and take a tan.

  As if she wasn’t there being interrogated, she casually put her hair into a ponytail and primped, trying to make the best of it. She didn’t find much relief from the heat. Sweat beaded on the loose hairs on the back of her long neck, she fanned herself with her file. It had her name in big letters as if she were important. Who knows what it contained? She wasn’t a saint, but certainly not a criminal. Not really, in her mind.

  Feeling suddenly paranoid, she wondered who else was watching her. Maybe a bunch of these scoundrels watched from behind the mirror. When she turned to look behind her, Ed Giovanni seized the file and deposited it out of reach as if she were a child. She shrugged. *Keep it cool,* she told herself, reaching for her lighter. She smoked yet another cigarette, taking long, slow puffs to pass the time. He watched, unamused, by her defiance.

  “Well?” he loudly asked as if she were deaf, grabbing the table and shaking it. A few things rattled and tumbled over, such as his cup of coffee. She watched him take a lengthy breath, probably planning a different approach. Then he asked, “Aren’t you thirsty? Can I get you something to drink?”

  Offering a drink was a well-known ploy for obtaining fingerprints. That’s why police and lawyers always eagerly provided a glass as if being a considerate hostess. *They couldn’t care less if I wilted,* she sighed. Darlene shook her head and filled her mind with the latest antics from a sitcom. She almost laughed. Maybe he thought she was an idiot. But it was useful to occupy her mind, something she was familiar with doing at her dancing job. She had to put up with a lot of perverse men before Big Sal Bonfiglio took a liking to her. But associating with him had landed her here in hot water.

  Still studying her, the attorney paced around with a new coffee cup, which he had refilled twice. She hoped it was decaf. He seemed edgy, maybe because he was getting nowhere in his personal pursuit of one of the more reclusive crime families from New York, who started vacationing at the quiet Virginia beaches to avoid the Law and its scrutiny. 

  It was going to be a long day, she told herself. She checked her manicured nails for chips and pretended to be lost in thought. By keeping her there for hours, the prosecutor had only succeeded in annoying the hell out of her. He thought he was so damn smart. In his dark suit, he lorded over her like a badass. He demanded too much.  Information was dangerous, and he knew it. Didn’t he care that he risked her life? At least he was good-looking, she mused while fixing her bra which was riding up. She repositioned her large breasts into double-D cups and wiped off her sweat with his notepad. He gawked in disbelief but couldn’t speak. His curly hair and dauntless face made him look adorable – except he was the enemy. He oozed authority, but it could mean the end for her if she snitched. She wasn’t ready to die. Besides, she captured more dangerous men than him between her legs, and they usually fell to the ground before her, sometimes literally.

  Not giving in, she sat back in her chair and crossed her extensive legs. Her floral skirt barely fell to mid-thigh, a point he didn’t fail to notice. That baby-blue top hugged her plentiful chest, and her bra was slightly visible through the fabric. She knew her sassiness went from her bare-toed shoes to her fiery hair to the upturned nose and chin. She could tell he needed to show his dominance if he wanted to break her. She wasn’t about to make it easy for him.

  He got in her face and said, “You must *want* to go to jail.”

  “My only crime is going on a date with a man with the last name of Bonfiglio. Love is not a felony, honey. You just want to be Mr. Big Deal Prosecutor.”

  “I’m warning you! Tell me where your husband is!”

  “That is your job. I came to you for help! He has been missing for two years. What have you done to find him?”

  “I will ask you one more time. Where is Bob Chase?”

  “And I will tell you once again, you bastard,” she snarled. “Bob had a gambling problem. He owed money. He either ran or got caught by the people he owed. I’ve been waiting two years for you to do something about it. It’s been hard. I barely make it. And, yes, I was asked out on a date, so I went. Big Deal!”

  She shrugged and went back to her cigarette, which he knocked out of her hand. She bent over to snatch it from the tiled floor, but he quickly grabbed her shirt and pulled her to his eye level. She could feel his breath against her lacquered lips, causing her mouth to open in alarm. Without warning, he planted a deep kiss on her, and she responded to his passion with a wave of pent-up feelings and confusion. Her hands slid through his dark curls, moving down to caress his peppery scented neck as their tongues entwined. That encouragement made him even more ravenous for this forbidden aspiration. He tugged off her tank top and teeny bra to greedily eye the breasts that had taunted him since she arrived. Every inch of her creamy flesh with those blood-encrusted jewels from mafia crimes made his mind reel, but the sight of those natural breasts and how they felt in his hands made him at her mercy. He was intoxicated by her – despite what his ethics warned. As for her, she only felt power when men desired her. 

  He knelt down, slipped off her shoes and kissed her painted toes before working his way up to her inhumanly long legs, which quivered at their core. He quickly sought access and settled between them. She held him tight to her, digging sharp nails into his back, happily marking him an adulterer. He fell victim to her charms and she hoped he would now remain her ally. That is how she played this game.  She naively felt she had won.

   However, this man of the law enjoyed the most intimate depths of her just hours after a mob boss did. Maybe their seed met and collided on its way to making her a child – something that her missing husband Bob could never give her. Good and evil, morality and immorality, finity and the desire for infinity grappled for conquest. And soon something would become of it, something beautiful.

  After he fell exhausted on top of her, she pushed him aside and smiled. She dressed without speaking to him and then strolled out of the interrogation room and into the awaiting limo, keeping her little secret to herself. She reached into her purse, fixed her lipstick, and daydreamed about this lawyer. But who was she kidding? He would never love her. No one ever did. She only allowed herself one moment of sorrow over that. With a shrug of her shoulders, she pulled out her purse again and popped some pills.

Nine months later a girl was born, and Darlene sent a picture to both Big Sal Bonfiglio and federal prosecutor, Ed Giovanni. Though the irritable child offered little clue as to her origin, Darlene saw her otherworldly eyes and her fiery highlights playing against the darker tones. But what did it matter? Both men supported the child financially, and since Ed Giovanni was married, he didn’t let it slip that the child could be his. Big Sal never cared otherwise. Something about the strange girl softened his heart and he treated her like his own.

  “My Finity,” Darlene said with a sigh, holding the intense child who hated affection. “You could one day be the end of me or an end to a horrible family that took away my husband.”

   The child barely noticed her. She sometimes preferred the mobile toy over her crib to human faces, from which she routinely turned away. Darlene struggled to bond with this difficult child and with the desire to hide her away from a cruel world. She home-schooled her, leaving her in solitude while others went to public school. Because she didn’t have much of an education herself, she used free homeschooling resources. To her relief, the kid had no problem learning.

   As she grew, Finity played in the dandelion fields outside of their apartment, but she was rarely alone as her mother had hoped. Finity would regularly put on her best dress, a navy-blue one that made her feel so pretty, and await her usual guests. Though she didn’t like most people, she started to like the “shadows,” because they were friendly, though some of them were quite grim.

   Footsteps sounded nearby.

   A large man with a double chin and black hair greeted the girl with a smile. He was dressed casually but held the air of a king. Although of average height, he towered over her, so he sat down beside her and chatted, saying the weather was nice. They had pretend tea and she listened to tales of his boyhood in Italy, rarely speaking in return. In a dangerous world, the little girl’s silence endeared her to him. Unlike his other kin, he had no fear that she would betray him. She was the only good thing he had, despite a marriage to Janine, whom he rarely saw, and a couple of kids busy with teenage lives. She was his treasure, separate from his brutal existence. And he hoped to keep it that way for as long as possible.

   Though Darlene thought Finity merely had invisible friends at her tea parties, because Finity often spoke of an unfamiliar character named Emmanuel or “Manny,” and someone called Big Daddy, who came to see heer, no one knew for sure if these individuals were real. As a high-functioning autistic, Finity lived in her own world half the time playing repetitious games. A tiny child, she often looked up to block the sun from her eyes to see the shadowy form of a man who called her Princess, or to see the emotionless string of men who came after Big Daddy left to get information about him, all of whom brought her little cakes and trinkets like offerings to the doomed. 

   Finity actually preferred the emotionless men in their pressed suits. They seemed so robotic. Animated people stressed her. These serious men calmed her. They seemed less real. They never even smiled. 

   Maybe due to the lack of a real father, her arms would curl around Manny’s neck when he tried to leave and she would cling to him. He was as non-threatening as sunshine. Though affection usually troubled her, she didn’t see this bonding as anything different than embracing her lifeless stuffed animals. Besides, Manny was also bothered by friendliness, but he didn’t have the heart to push the child away. The dark-featured man crept back to the shade. He just happened to be one of the many specters that visited the edge of her life.

   Ed, or Eddie, as Finity knew him, sometimes visited late at night, bringing furs to Darlene or harassing her about “the family,” whoever they were. He didn’t pay Finity much attention, just stared at her features, as if trying to figure something out. He made her uneasy, especially when he fought with her mother. They had a turbulent love-hate relationship that occasionally left her mother battered and crumpled on the floor crying. Finity covered her ears and rocked back and forth, trying to mentally escape. Sometimes she’d band on the walls when she wanted him to stop.

   When Finity mentioned this to Big Daddy one day, Eddie stopped coming around. Darlene was devastated and stayed in bed for days with the heavy quilt drawn up around her. Her reddish hair hung in matted clumps and her beautiful face looked haggard. That’s when Finity asked what was wrong. Her Mom said that Ed Giovanni probably went to stay with Bob Chase in his underwater home.

   “Don’t worry. Maybe one day you will go there too,” Finity innocently replied, not knowing what that really meant.

   Darlene sobbed.

   Since Bob’s body was never found, Darlene was still legally married until Bob was declared legally dead, so listed him as Finity’s father on her birth certificate. She often talked to Finity about her “Dad,” whom the child assumed was Bob Chase, a former garbage collector from New York. He was said to be a kind man with a comical streak. He had dark eyes, a crooked nose, and small lips unlike her. She kept his picture by her lace pillow. Finity wanted a real dad so much, so she clung to his image. Darlene never corrected her, so the truth sank away like discarded bones.

   With Eddie gone, Darlene became an alcoholic. She stumbled around the spacious apartment feeling sorry for herself. Big Sal had too many girlfriends, and he rarely saw Darlene after the baby was born, except to see the kid and bring her money. Maybe he thought her stripper body changed too much. Sometimes she would stare in the mirror, wondering where her looks had gone. And the poor child was outside more and more waiting for someone, anyone to care for her, especially the shadowy men. They took more and more to the background the older she got, but she could still feel them watching her. Like ominous shapes they were waiting and wondering, just like her, about what fate had in store for this loose end named Finity, who didn’t have much of a beginning and was, perhaps only a harbinger for a violent end.[Finity trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxYP87KWBa8)",1,1750965931.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

Dating back to the 1800’s in China, Mahjong has been a widely popular game making its way to the United States in the early 1920’s. The rituals of setting up walls, doing the Charleston (tile exchange with other players) and constructing a winning hand are all parts of the game. In American Mahjong, we follow the rules established by the National Mah Jongg League, Inc. Created 88 years ago in New York City, this group of Jewish women create a new combination of winning hands yearly (referred to as The Card). At Mahjong 101 we cover: The End Goal (making a 14 tile winning combination and yelling, Mahjong!). The Tiles, The Card & The Deal. Finding a Section (and then a Line). The Charleston. Calling a Tile. Maintaining Pace of Play. Why learn mahjong? Mahjong is more than a game.

This post is for people living near Amsterdam or in the Netherlands. Sorry about it but long distance is not my thing..

I live in Amsterdam and living in Europe for more than 15 years. I am learning Dutch and I’m more confident that I will learn it someday unlike German 😅

I’m a 36-year-old Indian origin, whose father says he is no longer Indian 🤣. Probably because I picked up things from various cultures while living in and traveling to multiple countries, and they really changed how I see and live my life. I’ve light tanned skin, Black hair, Brown eyes, 183cm tall (not tall by Dutch standards, but I can reach things on the top shelf), broad shoulders, slightly muscular, and powered mostly by hugs.

I work in senior management at an international company – fancy title, but still can’t remember name of people I meet.

Now onto the good stuff…

Who am I?

📸 Photography nerd – will lie in mud for the perfect sunset shot.

🏍️ Motorbike rider – nothing beats a long ride with no destination.

🥾 Hiking enthusiast – let’s climb something tall and wonder why we did.

🍳 Lazy-ass cook – food’s great, but I don’t follow recipes, I follow mood.

🍰 Sweet tooth champion – will propose if you bake a great cake.

🏋️‍♂️ Lift weights – Muscles and fitness is as important as eating cake.

✈️ Travel addict – have passport, seen many countries, will explore more. Next dream: settle near water, adopt pets, live slow.

Looking for someone who fit at least one or two things below.

• Enjoys hugs and cuddles like I do oxygen.

• Likes travel, nature, and lazy Sundays.

• Takes care of her body and health (but yes, we can eat cake).

• Is open to pets and future waterside living.

• Love to Bake (or at least enables my dessert addiction).

I love affection – hugs, cuddles, forehead kisses, the whole warm and fuzzy package. I don't enjoy penetrative sex, but show my love/intimacy through touch, affection and closeness. So, if you are comfortable with this and think you can bear with me in real life then send me a message!

Let’s make a life full of adventure, laughter, and cake crumbs.

We will be a good match if you don't think a “great connection” means endless texting and a job interview 😂 Let's have a real-life convo over coffee, a walk, or anything low-pressure.

Note: I’m also looking for new friends (any gender) to hangout and do activities outside but I approach dating and friendships differently, so please mention in your message that you read this post else I will keep you only in friend zone 🤣",1,1750965921.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

It's been quite a while since I’ve connected with someone romantically or even socially, if I’m being honest. I haven’t been in a relationship in a couple of years, and I’ve mostly kept to myself outside of work and family. That’s made me a bit more shy and awkward (than I already was, lol), and really missing something I think we all need: a little intimacy.

I’m not looking to rush into anything serious right away. But I'd love to meet someone to spend a little bit of time with. Maybe over coffee or something else low-key. And if it feels right, maybe we end up making out and feeling a little close again. No pressure. I'm not looking for anything more intimate than that. But I'm not against a romantic connection if things naturally go in that direction.

I'm pretty open when it comes to age — anywhere from 25 to 55 or so. I tend to be most attracted to curvier or plus-size women, but more than anything, I just want someone kind and non-judgmental to share a moment or two with.

If this sounds like something you’d be open to, don’t be shy. I’d love to hear from you.",1,1750965878.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

ISO Roommate in Large Williamsburg Apartment Available 8/1.

Financial Requirements: 40x/Rent and Credit Score of 700+. $2112.50/month. 

Room: One private room and walk-in closet in 2BR 1 BTH Williamsburg apartment. You would have the bedroom to the left + the walk-in closet near the living room (in the video and floorplan).

Apartment: Williamsburg. A ton of space — 985 sq ft. Dishwasher in-unit. Laundry in building. High ceilings and massive windows in bedroom. 

Location:
Close to 4 different lines!
- 6min walk to M & JZ Lorimer
- 10min walk to L Montrose
- 10min walk to G Broadway

Safe area. Great spot if you want closet space and easy access to multiple commuting lines. Tons of good food spots in the surrounding blocks.

Furniture: Enough space in the living room to bring your furniture. I have a tv-stand, tv, coffee table, and couch currently, but we could fit a second set tbh!

About Me: I’m 27M. Work in finance in FiDi. In-office 4-5 days/week. I enjoy working out, going to dinner and events with friends, watching TV, and riding my motorcycle. Like to chitchat with my roommate, but can give you space and keep to myself, especially after a long workday. Personally, I don’t bring friends over that often bc I usually go to them. I like to keep public spaces neat. I clean weekly and expect to share chores to minimize those chores for the both of us. LGBT+ ally.

Note: video is from before I moved in, but apartment isn’t much different. Just different furniture.

Somebody I briefly met through another role invited me to apply to a position at an organisation that he had recently joined. He met me for a coffee and explained the role to me. A couple weeks later, I formally submitted my application via email. 

They took forever to get back and when they finally did they asked me to come to a workshop that they were organising in the outskirts of the city I live in. I reluctantly accepted since it seemed like a good role. At the workshop I was supposed to be interviewed by three people. The day was pretty exhausting. It involved writing and drawing comics on a chart. I was interviewing for a visual designer position so naturally people asked me to draw the comics. I did that, was super participative the whole day, and even volunteered to help another group finish their comic (Some much required buttering). Nobody interviewed me that day. 

Instead, I had four rounds of interviews over the next two months and upon following up a few times, they informed me that they changed the role and that the budget was slashed by over half!!!! They asked if I still wanted to continue and I was so mad. I shared some feedback about the interview process and the person I spoke to said “I have 20 years of experience in the social sector and all companies work like this.”

# The Issue

My wife's all-time favorite creamer is Chobani's White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha. She looks forward to it every season, savoring each cup of coffee enhanced by its delightful blend of rich white chocolate and tangy raspberry. Its seasonal availability, however, often brings disappointment as it disappears from the shelves all too soon. I am convinced that there must be countless others who share this sentiment, eagerly waiting for this beloved flavor to become a staple, available at any time of the year.  
  
Chobani has a reputation for offering quality products that cater to its consumers’ desires, and expanding their product line to include this creamer all year would no doubt resonate with a loyal customer base, besides attracting new fans. This sweet and sophisticated flavor combination isn't just a treat; it's an experience that enriches our daily cup of coffee, turning it into something special.  
  
Furthermore, making the White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha creamer a year-round option could benefit Chobani economically. By meeting a growing demand, they reinforce brand loyalty and potentially increase sales. Such a decision reflects a commitment to customer satisfaction and places Chobani in an even stronger position within the competitive creamer market.  
  
Join me in asking Chobani to listen to their customers and bring joy to many coffee enthusiasts by making the White Chocolate Raspberry Mocha creamer a permanent offering. Sign this petition to show your support for this beloved flavor's year-round availability.

.....buuuut the office *environment* is totally against it! 

There's no escaping the harsh fluro lights (hello daily migraine), the whole office is one big open plan encompassing all teams, think sales and account managers taking loud calls all. Of. The. Time. Next to folks in support (aka le me). Sales also has a big gong that they bang evey time they close a sale. So that's fun. 

And no fixed desks (you have to book them, but only half of the people do, which does my head in as it results in running around like a headless chicken having to find a desk that is ACTUALLY free).

Today I lost my loop earplugs, the noise cancelling headphones hurt my ears like crazy, but had to use them because of the missing loops. Everyone was in because the CEO was in (dude is awesome) and multiple very loud rounds of applause followed numerous meetings and speeches. 

Then a colleague helped themselves (rightfully so) to a mint, which they proceeded to chew oh so i credibly loud (misophonia anyone?)

I barely held back - not sure how - limited my outburst to a ""passive aggressive"" slamming of my coffee cup on my desk which seems to have gone unnoticed, and then snuck outside.

I'll have a chat with my manager hopefully tomorrow while this is still fresh so I don't minimize it (I tend to do that), but does anyone think I'm the issue and I should just suck it up?

Has anyone else made similar ""complaints"" to their workplaces, and how did it go?

But can anyone else relate to each and every day being utter chaos, and feeling like you’re just about getting through? Like I’m just about surviving, and barely. 

My beautiful smiley toddler turned 2 this week, and my youngest is 11 weeks old. 

I love them both so much but feel totally pulled between them at all times. I have so much mum guilt towards my toddler because the baby just wants to be latched and held the entire time (normal I know, my first was also a Velcro baby!) I’m happy to lean into this season of being needed but I feel like my toddler is missing out on so much. He’s desperate to play/cuddle with me; and I do try to give him some 1:1 time every day where I really focus and we cuddle/chat/play but obviously this is a fraction of what he’s used to. My partner is a doctor so works ridiculous shifts and we have 0 village/help, apart from nursery that my toddler goes to 3 days a week (he loves going and is thriving there). 

I love my baby, we’ve bonded really well and feeding etc is going super well, the mum guilt though towards my eldest is horrendous and getting me down. I thought at this point it would ease but it hasn’t. 

I take the boys out to different activities every day, like forest school, soft plays, local coffee shops for a treat, I feel like I’m doing my absolute best but that it’s just not getting any easier or more enjoyable. 

Is there something wrong with me? Has anyone else felt like this and did you find anything that helped?

What's up everybody its ya boi Frank, Frankie, Francisco! I just finished smoking a joint and I googled the best way to make friends and while I'm not able to really go anywhere far I have my pc, my phone and the internet! I figured I should give this a shot. Ya know, put myself out there. I'm a 5'11 Puerto Rican with long curly hair. As a huge gamer I think I have a duty to find other gamers, as I once did. I'm welcoming all who wish to apply just be kind and respectful and I will return the favor. I also enjoy hiking the forests and taking pictures with atmosphere or that present ambiance. Sometimes I also just take pictures to learn to shoot them better on my phone. I love going thrifting, I recently bought a night stand set that I painted black, sanded, stained and sealed the middle part. it came out nice but they're gone now my job threw them away. I love to theorize and brainstorm about practically anything. I'm very creative and think outside of the box most of the time, though I am direct. I also do a small amount of wood working, none now since I got let go. But it's a small hobby. I'm a big foodie and love all kinds of food. I make a mean sandwich and cup of ramen! (No seriously I turned it into a craft) I enjoy fitness as well, but I haven't been to the gym in quite some time. Coffee guy on occasion, Matcha is just dirt but I love it anyway. I also enjoy anime quite a bit, little bit of an anime nerd too. Love the visuals, I'm an aethetique kind of guy. Used to do parkour and ride a skateboard when I was much younger. My knees can no longer sustain such vicious wars. Live in CT, born in the Bronx. Big on music and great audio, not Hi-Fi but it is possible in the future. Enjoy most types of music, big on edm, dubstep, electronic, rock, 90's stuff, 70's stuff too, not too big on rap but can enjoy it. Not into country. I also enjoy cinema but not as deeply and as vested as I am in the previous.

1ll8z0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/IcedCoffee/comments/1ll8z0c/growler_steeping_jar/,Growler Steeping Jar,"I was trying to find a large jug/jar to steep some cold brew in. I came across an old 64 FL.OZ. Growler from a brewery, and I also found a smaller 32 oz one. I'm leaning towards the 64, because I don't want to have to keep making it every other day. On top of having to wait almost an entire day for it to be ready, would much rather a larger batch that will last 3-5 days. Then I can start a smaller batch in the 32 oz one while I finish off the last of the 64.   
  
I will be filtering out the cold brew at around the 16-20 hr mark via fine stainless steel strainer, and maybe a cheese cloth if there's too much sludge for my liking. I prefer Dark Roasts, but usually buy what ever is on sale at Costco (I don't get the flavoured coffees). I usually get the Starbucks Verona, Kirkland French Roast, and the Zavida Columbian Medium. I do not have a scale, and am not a coffee snob, so things do not need to be exact. That does not mean I cannot tell a good coffee from a bad one.

What size would be the best to use?  
does cold brew coffee taste any difference if its been in the fridge after a few days?  
Any suggestions on a brand/coffee available at Costco thats great for cold brews,?  
How much coffee should I be adding to the 64 fl oz growler?

I asked AI and the answer I received was:  
**Best Growler Size:** Use the 64 fl. oz. growler. It aligns with your preference for larger batches lasting 3-5 days.

* **Cold Brew Taste After Days in Fridge:** Cold brew can lose some of its nuanced flavors and become slightly less vibrant after a few days in the fridge. However, it generally remains palatable and enjoyable for up to a week.
* **Costco Coffee for Cold Brew:** The Kirkland French Roast is a solid choice for cold brew due to its dark, robust flavor profile that stands up well to the brewing method.
* **Coffee for 64 fl. oz. Growler (No Scale):** For a strong cold brew concentrate, aim for approximately 1.5 to 2 cups of whole bean or coarsely ground coffee for your 64 fl. oz. growler. Adjust in future batches based on your taste preference.

I notice that after about an hour of taking it, I find I am more ""emotionally activated"".  For example, I go to a meeting with a trusted colleague, and I find I am happy to see them and engage challenges with them.  Or random mid-day desires to call the parents just to check in.  In the past, I would say there was a baseline emotional response, I was just much more mechanical.

I will add that I usually have a coffee within a similar time frame; curious if caffeine might be a contributing factor.

I barely taste it. All i taste is the milk and the vanilla I might add, with a slight hint of chocolate which is extremely underwhelming.

I have tried salt, instant coffee, chocolate liqueurs and chocolate tequila, and nope nothing, it doesn't even come close to recipes that use actual chocolate.

Can someone tell me if I could be doing anything wrong? I've used dutch and natural, but I get the same results. Chocolate is extremely expensive here and once you add it to the mix the recipe is no longer affordable and its not even worth making. Seems like the only logical approach is either to spend a ton of money or don't try at all, which is really disappointing. I want to make a hefty batch for my whole family and I cant be buying 3-4 bars of chocolate, its just overwhelmingly expensive, but seems like theres no other choice.

  
Heres the simple recipe Im working with

500ml of milk

250g of sweetened condensed milk

200ml heavy cream

40g of cocoa powder

40g of sugar

1 tsp of corn starch 

A pinch of salt

\+Optional (things ive tried)

1/2 tsp instant coffee

Different types of alcohol (about 1 tbsp)

And vanilla

  
I know this is quite a noob recipe and I know most of you here are not into condensed milk but again, I want to make it as simple as possible, so I chose the condensed milk to mitigate for the absence of some short of syrup.

And yes, I do have WAY better, more complicated recipes with xantham gum, glucose, milk powder etc etc, but Im trying to keep things simple and accessible with this recipe, so I can easily give the recipe to a friend or something.

Last night was not what I had hoped.

I drifted to sleep, blindly hoping that I would wake up having freed myself of the terror. Instead, I found myself back in the cemetery. Again, the dream took on a new form.

*I am there, staring at the swelling black curtains, only inches away from me. After hours of agonizing fear I feel the invisible hand wrap around my throat once again. It squeezes tightly—my breathing turns desperate. Through choked breaths, I plead to be let go but the hand does not concede. My throat collapses all over again, slowly and dutifully submitting to the hand’s strength. I cough violently, feeling as though I will hack up my organs if it goes on for a moment longer. As I beg with half-formed words, the darkness becomes more alive than ever before.*

*The buzzing sound grows tremendously loud; the noise, formerly indistinct, now takes shape. The vibrations of the hidden insects become a conduit for something much more human—humming the theme song of Little House on the Prairie. Nostalgia curdles in my stomach as the melody begins to drift subtly off-pitch, paired with an almost imperceptible increase of the tempo. Layered on top of the buzzing and humming, a voice forms from the dark, delivering jumbled phrases, as if a broken tape recorder is spitting out disjointed words—a cheap mimicry of human speech.*

*“For eternity… I don’t want—want—want—want to leave, I don’t. I DON’T. NO, NO, NO–For eternity? Come in here, buddy—I, what? What? Turn it back on, please. I need it back.”*

*The chopped-up mutterings come from a deep male voice—nearly indistinguishable from my father’s.*

*The disembodied voice switches tone; I hear a female voice, far more coherently replicated than the previous imitation.*

*“Hello? Joseph, can you please take a sho—oh! Sorry boys, I didn’t realize you were asleep—it’s early, but Angie misses you both, so get up…”*

*Again I hear the stammering, staticky voice of my father.*

*“She’s coming really soon—look up at the treeeeees, aren’t they soooooooooooooooooooo tall?”*

*Synapses fire in recognition of that phrase. Where do I remember that from? The wretched voice continues to distort his words, half-howling while maintaining a sinisterly coy delivery. The words come to me as though invisible lips were pressing to my ear.*

*“Look up… please—JJ, WHERE ARE YOUUUUUUUU? I WANT TO SEE YOUUUU? I’M UP IN MY BEDROOM, I MISSS— I… I miss you, I really do…”*

*I hear his voice much more clearly, just before it returns to incoherent babbling. I lose track of it, swallowed whole by the raging storm of creatures waiting to pounce.*

*I look up to the tops of the trees, swaying my broken neck. I stare in awe of their height until, suddenly, the curtains fall.*

*A swarm of insects rushes forth. The air is now unbelievably humid, far more capable of ushering forth the putrid stench of rot–it’s so thick that I can taste it, almost as dew drops on my tongue. I try to shut my mouth, but–for the first time–I feel a second hand. Settling two fingertips on my face, one on either side of my jaw, it squeezes tighter and tighter. Suddenly it rips downward, dislocating my jaw with a sound that seemed closer to a crack of thunder.*

*Now hung open, I could no longer fight the stench nor the insects. Feeling my throat fill with tiny, squirming bugs, I give in. After a near eternity, all sounds halt and I open my eyes to see a figure in front of me, slowly emerging as the insects disperse in every direction.*

*In complete silence, like an old movie scene, I see the bugs, now filling the sky–my head bobs back. In a momentary glimpse I am only able to notice a pair of eyes, wide open and entirely unmoving—the plastic eyes of a doll, loosely nestled within deep sockets. As my limp neck bounces back, I stare down at the dirty and battered arms of suit jacket bridging the gap between the figure and myself. With one final tilt of my head, I see white liquid, foaming from between a pair of chapped lips—contorted into a smile. Shadows obscure nearly every other detail, but the figure seems to be ready.*

*Before it can emerge I choke out one last cough, spewing a chunk of saliva-covered insects with it–entirely depleted of air, I black out.*

*--*

When I woke up I was relieved to feel that my throat was no more bruised than it had been the past few nights, though a horrendous, bitter taste overwhelmed it that I can only compare to arsenic nasal drip. I went to the sink to wash my mouth, then noticed that I could not hear the running water–the buzzing still rang in my ears. Gently, and without any inclination as to why I was doing it, I began to wrap my hands around my throat. The tender skin ached as I squeezed down; my subconscious unable to protect me from choking myself–I wasn’t even sure if I was the one moving my hands. The shower curtain in my childhood bathroom had been gone for years, replaced by a glass door, which was actually quite a relief to me as it got rid of that monster’s hiding spot.

Then, I hear the window slide up, cautiously I guide my eyes over, the only thing I still have control of.

The face of the man from my nightmare cartoonishly pops through the window; its expression made of gleering eyes and a half-witted smile. My hands grow tighter around my neck–my trachea threatens to crumble at any moment.

Involuntarily I turn, only slightly, towards the window. Now, rather than being able to see it in the mirror, it is several feet to my back left, only slightly accessible in the corner of my vision. I fail entirely as I strain to turn my head and gain clear sight of the watchful eyes.  The image in the corner of my view is nothing more than a blur, but I can make out its grotesque movement as I stand, entirely still and suffocating to death. These thoughts feel relatively unimportant, though, as I see the creature slide down, through the window and out of sight. I can hear its suit buttons clatter against the floor tiles, growing closer.

After so many run-ins with these impossible situations, I was capable of deciphering dreams from reality; unfortunately, I knew I was awake. Despite my every wish, I knew what was coming and prayed that my lack of genuine rest had sent me into a hallucination.

If I am able to move, my body would collapse in reaction to the next feeling; my back, muscles–tight in anticipation of the being behind me–become immediately flaccid as I felt a wet, scratchy face press timidly against my lower back. Patiently, it slides up my spine, careful not to come any closer than necessary, only letting the prickly hairs deliver a fluid onto my back–I’m forced to imagine it was pouring from between gritted teeth and an unbearable smile. When it reaches the top of my spine my tears begin to pour; its crusted lips brush against the nape of my neck, scratching as they find their way up to my ear. Upon arrival, the figure holds its mouth at such a distance so that the flaky skin would only tickle my earlobes. The lips part like a dam opening the floodgates–ushering forward a humid breath that dampens my cheek and earlobe. The breath carries forth an equally unpleasant smell, one I have come to know quite well. Even through my collapsing throat it is enough to make me wretch. I hear a shaky whisper–its trembling was a consequence of stifling laughter;

*“Yooooooouuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu…Don’t you get curious sometimes? Ever wonder how it felt for him?” Breathily, now, as if it were excited, “Try it, you know you want to…I’ve been trying to show you how good it feels. JJ, I think you’ll really, really like it…it was good enough for him to forget about you, wasn’t it? Rememberrrrrr, JJ. I’ll let you see my face if you–”*

The figure lets out several low, raspy, crackling coughs; immediately following this he begins to release a childlike giggle in my ear, the sound bubbles and screeches like an overflowing pot of boiling water as it grows more emphatic. The desperate, wheezing laughter begins to morph into the drone of millions of flies. They desperately pour from his throat, filling up the bathroom. As my vision becomes clouded, the bathroom shrinks into a few patches of light that will soon be filled by flies. As I hold onto the last bit of light my hands release slightly, now only barely aggravating my fuschia bruises. A wave of relief rushes over me, yet I remain unable to move my own body.

Presumably in reaction to my new-found freedom, the monster’s hands begin to shift towards my stomach. As if imitating a spider’s jumpy movement, the monster taps its fingers like legs, crawling up the sides of my stomach, through my armpits, up my neck and under my ears–and then it reaches my face. 

The fingers–with their horrid, unkempt nails and calloused skin–smell sickly-sweet. Rotten.

They linger against my cheeks for a moment before brushing away my tears. Comfortingly, the hands rustle my hair, then guided my head gently towards the mirror. I can only make out its hollowed, sunken doll eyes before I feel the hand begin to push the back of my head. 

With a slow but incredibly assertive force the hand pushes my head towards the mirror. My forehead reaches it first, the hand now pressing forward with the patient, damning strength of a hydraulic press. The flies are so densely packed by now that they cushion my forehead’s contact against the mirror, but my fleshy pillow of insect bodies is quickly pulverized under the pressure, leaving behind an impressive amount of bodily fluid to drip down my face. As it continues to push me onward, the hand grips so tightly it feels as though my brain is swelling far beyond the capacity of its shell.

I begin to shiver uncontrollably; the hand seems to suck the warmth from me. In the haze I started to feel the glass press into my skin, splintering under the pressure. Slowly, and with absolutely no hope to change the situation, I realize that this is where I will die. Cursed, likely from my birth, my hands have been bound to leave me defenseless against this monster–my legs have been forced to walk towards this inevitable fate. 

The moments before my head shatters through the mirror and my throat splits open against the glass are agonizing–the splintering of the glass worsens dramatically with each second. The hand takes as long as it can to draw out my demise.

Time drags as each crack in the glass finds its way into my skin, peeling apart my face and burrowing deeper. My eyes are next–splinters begin to scrape away at my eyelids, but the mirror is at its breaking point–I pray that I’ll be lucky enough to only suffer cuts on my eyelids before death. Instead, a number of broken shards slide from my brow, lubricated by my blood, and fall into the sockets. In an instant the barrier between the internals of my eye and the outside world is violated. It was a simple realization; a soft pop in each eye, and then the feeling of liquid rushing forth. 

When stabbed anywhere else one does not feel the absence of space–only the severe pain of the wound–but this is different. The searing pain seems to reach past my eyeballs, grinding against the bone of my eye sockets. Worse though, is the feeling of emptiness, maybe best compared to the acute awareness of the empty space left when a tooth falls out–one does not have to touch the area to realize there is a hole in their flesh, the feeling is constantly there. 

*And then, snap.*

My skull finds its way through the mirror–my neck is thrust into the shattered remains along the frame, almost entirely severed. It takes a moment for me to realize that I remain somehow, regrettably, alive. Upon having this realization I feel my hair yanked backwards. Then a familiar sensation arrives–my head flops sideways, as if only attached by a rubber band. Through the swarm of flies’ violent noise I hear its voice again, hissing:

*“I just want you to have what you need, why not let go? Are you that much of a fucking pussy? You know you want to, so grow a pair, you waste of cum. Let. the. Fuck. go.”*

Satisfied with its message, it disappeared, dropping me to the floor. My body became my own again and I, without hesitation, reached up to feel my eyes–they were still there, fully intact. At my side lay a shard of glass, draped in red. In the remains of the mirror–to my shock, it really was broken–I saw a skin-deep cut parallel to my hairline, with countless other gashes across my entire face. I grabbed the bloodied piece with my right hand, immediately flinching upon gripping it–carved into palm were cuts as well; perfectly, they matched the edges of the shard, a self-inflicted wound.

A million thoughts rushed through my head; more than anything, I was eager to dismiss this as another of my hallucinations, or rather, a psychotic break. I would have had every reason to do so–no matter how real they feel, I have proven myself incredibly capable of weaving dreams and reality so effectively that I could never really differentiate, but I was bothered by an entirely different revelation. Fighting from the deep recesses of my mind, the thought occurred; did *it* really have to kill me with its own hands? Has it ever even tried? It was clear to me that there was something more–the loss of a parent is a tragedy, but how could it lead to *this*? There were two possibilities; either I was truly, irrevocably insane, or the beast of my dreams was fully capable of controlling my body, and was using it to lead me to my death. The former would explain everything, only failing on a few minor accounts; primarily, the origin of my madness. As a child I was troubled, but I moved on. And, not to forget, those markings on my throat–how could bruises from hands so giant be self-inflicted? 

I had to find out what “it” was and how it ever came to be. I could not have imagined how terrible the answer would be, even though the answers were so clear all along.

*I denied it, I had to.*

\--

Before I even realized what I was doing I had begun driving to the cemetery, this would be my first time back since that day that has plagued my life. My legs moved themselves, walking me down the same path that I had so many years ago. My hand felt the tightening grip of my mother’s; I heard the echoes of my baby sister’s cries and laughter; I stared at the many aged gravestones, although far more were now softened–nothing more than markers for long-forgotten loved ones who selfishly left the world behind.

When I got to his plot, I didn’t even glance at his gravestone. Instead, I stared at that same coastal sky, obscured by what I had to believe were the exact same foreboding clouds. Maybe it was the fact that the scene was identical, but it was only now that I realized that exactly eighteen years had passed since the invisible hand began to beckon me into the gaps between the trees. In that moment, though, the pines looked far smaller than I remembered. Their curtains had fallen revealing a truth so obvious that I began to laugh–the woods simply went on.

I thought; “Of course, I always knew that they were just woods, and that the trees were just trees. Somehow I had convinced myself that there had to be more, but there could never have been unbelievably dark curtains draped between the trees, or any unknown, desperate creatures, or a ridiculous invisible hand.”

And for a brief moment I felt truly comforted in that belief, but then I wondered if it was even possible for my subconscious to have led me back here, on the same exact day; or for the weather to perfectly match my memory. Maybe I suffered psychosomatic symptoms as a child, but what about the blood on my head, or the buzzing that continued to echo in my ears. As I looked back towards the trees, I questioned if I had simply imagined them as being smaller–at the very same instant, they began to stretch towards the sky in front of me, and the woods beyond slowly dissipated into tangled, moving shadows. The sound of buzzing grew oppressively loud, and my breath became shallow.

I cried out, “YOU’RE NOT REAL, YOU CAN’T BE. HE’S DEAD SO JUST LET ME GO–” but I stopped myself, overcome by the thought: 

*Why did my voice have to sound so much like his?*

I thought back to the time without dreams, to the many years of calm, uninterrupted sleep. I wished desperately to return to that time. Unwittingly, I had begun squeezing my eyes shut so tightly it hurt. 

When I opened them I saw my fathers face–the same sunken, hollow expression that I had seen buried in his shadowy room–now dimly lit in the blackness below the trees. His eyes flickered up towards me, fighting to stay open. 

He smiled. 

I smiled back.

I asked him why he left; his face softened, now a look of loving concern.

I heard his voice, gently assuring me,

*“You already know why, don’t you? I love you, JJ, for eternity. Now please come closer, I want to see your face. I need to hold you.”*

I begged him to leave the woods, to come to me.

Abruptly, the figure jolted forward. His spindly arms preceded him–I watched as the stretched appendages jumped between physical states like two reels of film projected on top of one another. In one, its arms slowly coiled up and unfurled–snapping the bones and grinding them against each other. In the other, his forearms jutted to unfeasible angles, far beyond the limits of the elbows. The sound of bones cracking filled the air, but they were not simply breaking–they were adjusting themselves. 

Before revealing anymore of itself, the entity decided on a form that was suitable; the splintered realities aligned as the arms snapped into place, now they hung limply at his sides, spindly and unwieldy. At the ends of its newly formed arms, fingers jittered back and forth on distended hands, entirely too large for even his body. His eyes, though… they were human. They were Dad’s.

*“JJ?”* his shadowy smile grew larger.

*“You look so handsome, just like your old man…”* his voice was cooing, warm. It carried the same raspy, calming inflection I knew so well–the voice I longed to hear again.

*“Please… let me get a closer look, you know my eyes were never the best without my specs. I just–I really missed you.”*

I couldn’t believe what I was seeing, “Dad? Dad, what is wrong with you? Are you okay? How are you even here?”

*“What, you think I wouldn’t say goodbye? To my boy, my baby? You–you think I didn’t know I’d be here? I never really left, I couldn’t leave you behind. My boy… just come here, how many times do I have to ask?”* Uttering the last few words, his smile dimmed.

“Daddy, I can’t–why can’t you just come closer? You aren’t acting right. I missed you, too–” my voice sounded so young, so frightened.

The first tear fell from my eye, stinging the cuts that covered my face. In the pain came memories of those impossible hands, the years of suffering they inflicted on me. For a brief, pathetic moment I believed him–in spite of everything, I wanted to. 

I drew back, and in exchange he took a step forward–seemingly aware of my new found distrust.

I began to make out his face more clearly: a bubbling, white liquid dripped down his chin from a familiar smile, softening his scruffy five o’clock shadow. 

*“Do you remember how much I love you? Why don’t you just–JJ are you listening? Can you hear me? Can you just, please, listen to me for one goddamn second?”*

I took another step back, and again, he came closer. My body reacted, my hands covering the bruised skin of my throat.

*“I am telling you. You–LISTEN–you need to come here, right now.”*

I revolted, his fingers were no longer twitching–they reached, curling and uncurling, as if feeling for something. As if waiting for a turn.

*“I am DONE playing this game with you. I have waited, and waited, and–YOU KEPT ME AROUND, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?”* As he barked at me, his voice began to falter–it would briefly slip into a register far deeper than my father’s, crackling from his hoarse throat.

Whimpering, I released the few words I could muster, “Please, *please*–just leave me alone. For once in my life I want to sleep, I want to forget about you.”

*“Oh booooohooo, how tragic. Why don’t you take a single second to think back? Was Daddy so special? He left you, you goddamn pansy. He didn’t give a single fuck about you, not enough to even leave you with a few words, you’re nothing, a nobody to everybody, but especially to your father. You don’t know a single thing about yourself or him, you’re still hiding from reality. If accepting the truth is so awful, why not just end your life? Is it really my job to make you accept that putting a stop to your miserable, pathetic existence is the only good thing you could ever do?”* 

His eyes were glassy and unblinking, even as the insects from my dreams began pouring from behind his eyeballs in writhing droves. With them came the stench. It was thick, sour. Not rot–something far worse. 

My stomach knotted, my vision blurred. What the hell was this smell? Why won’t it leave me alone for once in my life, for a single moment? I hated it, I fucking despised every moment of my life and I wanted to die, so why wouldn’t I? It gave me plenty of chances, it practically did the job for me–I hated that it was right. Yet I wanted to live, so badly–I must have. If I was really ready, wouldn’t I have walked to the woods? My twisted stomach began to boil–how many years could I handle wasting like this? Didn’t I deserve happiness too, or at least a goodbye? 

“DON’T YOU THINK I WANT TO DIE?” The words escaped me before I was even aware they were there.

It paused. Then let out a soft chuckle.

*“Oh, sweetheart,”* it said wryly, “*That’s all I’ve ever wanted to hear*.”

Something deep inside me snapped. “WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE? IF I’M SO WORTHLESS, WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT EVEN I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU?” 

I took a breath, “I… I don’t. I don’t need you. You’re not him and you could never be. Not even close.”

*“A little touchy, huh? I want you to do something for me, if you don't mind. Try and remember what made him sooooooo great. You don’t miss your father, you fucking crave him. It's sick, you disgusting, shriveled fuck. I can still see it in your eyes, everytime you think of him you get so excited.”* He grinned, clearly pleased to see me react\*. ""\*He wouldn’t give a shit about a little-pricked fuck like you.”

Vomit began to fill my throat; what was this *thing*? Its desperate attempts to degrade me–to make me feel worthless–stung, only for the fact that they came from *his* mouth.

*“Oh I’m just teasing, you fairy–and don’t think I don’t hear you in there–convincing yourself that it doesn’t bother you. I have heard your every thought for the past eighteen years. Do you even realize how constantly you think about him? You’re a broken record–either you let the fucking guy go, or you give up–he’s not coming back, and certainly not for you. Eighteen years, JJ–eighteen pointless years obsessing about a guy who didn’t think twice about you. Do you know why he didn’t leave you that letter? It wasn’t because you were unlucky, or because he wasn’t capable of loving you–your little obsession grossed him out, it made him resent you. Constantly begging for his attention–really, what else could he have felt? What kind of ten year old needs to sleep with Daddy every night? That is who you are, and who you will always be.”*

I stood, paralyzed, unable to distinguish between my feelings and that thing’s. I had known for a long time that the only real thing Dad left with me was a hollow heart, his parting gift. It really would have made me happier to leave the world behind, to fly away.

*“I–I can’t fucking stand it anymore and I know you can’t either–JJ, I SEE WHAT GOES ON IN THERE. EVERY FEAR. EVERY INSECURITY. THEY ARE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS OF THE TRUTH, SO STOP HIDING–FUCK–JUST FUCKING END IT BEFORE I–WHAT IS WROOOOONG WITH YOU?”* his voice no longer wavered; it had totally abandoned its imitation. It didn’t crackle–it screeched, desperately. Voices layered on top of voices, echoing and changing and crying:

*“YOU–WE–Heyyyy bud, when did you come in? WHY ARE YOuu–DON’T YOU SMELLL IT, YOU GREEDY FUCK? THAT’S ALL THAT’S LEFT OF GOOOOOOOOD OLDDD DADDDYYYY–SHUT THE FUCK UP, YOU, YOU–”*

The voices collapsed into one–for a fleeting moment, I heard my mother,

*“It’s fine if you want to stay here, my love–”*

And then, its face lurched towards me, its neck stretching far across the graveyard. I came face to face with the monster. Its was contorted with anger;

*“Do NOT think you can get away. You are a useless, self-obsessed, copycat who’s ‘Daddy’ hated him–that’s why he left, JJ, because he couldn’t stand you. Do your family a favor, make up for their loss by fucking. killing. yourself.”*

I couldn’t hear another word. Bearing witness to this horrific figure in full for the first time, the memory of the smell began to pester at me. I pushed away these thoughts as quickly as they came, but they were unrelenting. 

*When did I smell it for the first time?*

I saw *it* more clearly; beneath his disturbing facade was an unmistakable expression, a memory locked in the most unreachable part of my mind.

*Why did I have to recognize his face so clearly, so many years later?*

No–the memory may have been suppressed, but it was not locked. I could never truly hold it at bay; the imagery proliferated in my subconscious at every turn. Refusing to accept the nature of what happened back then, I disguised it in every possible way, desperate for any reality that denied my own.

“Wow, you think you figured it out, don’t you? Little JJ finally stopped living in denial–I’m so glad. Maybe this will finally push you over the edge… I’ll see you soon, freak.”

I had no choice, not anymore. I remembered now.

\--

Eighteen years ago, in early spring, my mother brought my baby sister to our aunt’s house for a night. After I refused to go along, my mother went to talk to my Dad, but standing at the bottom of the stairs, I heard sigh deeply and calmly ask him something to no response. When she came back, eyes now watery, she patiently said;

“It's fine if you want to stay here, my love, but please, if you need anything go next door, they have Auntie’s number. If I get a call I’ll come right home to–”

“Why wouldn’t I just go to Dad?” I asked, interjecting.

“JJ, your father needs more sleep than other people, let him rest for now, okay? I’ll be back soon.”

I told her I wouldn’t need anything, and they left.

It didn’t take long for me to need something, though, maybe just a few hours. What I needed was something that neither my Mom or neighbors could ever give me; I needed Dad.

I knocked on the bedroom door.

“Dad… you promised me we could watch a scary movie next time it was just us two. Wake up,” I slammed open the door, giggling while I shouted, “WAKE UP! IT'S TOO EARLY FOR SLEEP!”

And then I smelled the stench, one that has been stuck on the inside of my nose for my entire life. My brain could never truly forget it, although it tried so hard to. For eighteen years I convinced myself that this was the smell he *always* took up in his episodes, though I knew, I had to have known, somewhere deep down that I was lying to myself.

\--

When I was ten and a half years old, I found him.

I denied it then, tucked away from the world in the quiet of his room.

I understand it, finally.

He did not just pass away, he *left* us.

And I found him, although it took many years to realize what I had seen.

\--

There he was. The old wood-paneled television that my mother gifted him for their anniversary flickered against the dark. Its static made a piercing, ceaseless hum, filling the room. I called out, asking once, twice, “Dad, how can you sleep with that noise?” but he didn’t hear me.

The faint light of the television reached across the room, brushing his face with a shifting, electric glow. In the shadows, his cheeks looked hollow and his eyes sunken.

But they were open. His lips showed a gentle, melancholic smile.

I figured the light from outside would do the trick, so I set out to open the curtains. For some reason, though, I couldn’t do it. I hadn’t realized, but my hands were shaking and I was weeping, unable to hear my own whimpers over the television’s buzzing, now growing impossibly loud in my ears.

The moments that followed are the most vivid in my memories now. I took a step back, and then another. I thought about “Pa” from Little House on the Prairie, Dad’s favorite character. We spent much of our time watching the show, pretending to be a part of the cast. I knew that from my acting experience that Pa wouldn’t be nearly as scared as I was. I thought about the smile on Dad’s face whenever I pretended to be Pa, and I lurched forward to open the curtains.

The light rushed into the room, but so did the flies who found their way in through a crack in the window, lured by the odor. I began to sob uncontrollably. Unable to turn around–to bear seeing something that I, at least subconsciously, knew was behind me–I kept on waiting to hear Dad’s voice. I reached my hand out slowly, turning the television off. Losing track of time, the same phrases ran through my head at an unbelievable pace; my subconscious was desperate to rationalize the situation and I had no intention of stopping it. Over and over, all I could think was: “He must be really sick to sleep like this.” Despite my false confidence, I couldn’t muster the bravery to turn around.

I’m not sure how much time passed, but eventually I heard him wake up. 

I snapped my head around, thinking that his unintelligible noise meant we could go to the movies, or at least eat dinner. He coughed, or rather, *choked*. Despite the awful noise he emitted, his wet, hacking cough didn’t seem to be that bad–his body was almost entirely unflinching. And then he coughed again, this time I noticed another oddity; his eyes weren’t closing as he coughed. I saw something at the corner of his lips. Another moment passed, and a final cough. With it came a rush of white substance; his mouth was foaming up with some liquid that I found revolting and confusing.

Quickly I jumped up next to him, wailing, I begged:

“Daddy, please wake up! Look, you got sick on yourself. Please wake up–please. I-I can help you clean up.”

Using my sleeve I got the foaming liquid off his mouth and cheeks. I distinctly remember being so fearful when it came out of him, yet when I went to wipe it up there was no hesitation. In fact, I was suddenly calm. My eyes began to well up again but this time the tears fell upon a gentle, hesitant smile. It felt nice to help him, I guess.

The light faded as I laid next to him, going back and forth between begging him to wake up through sobs and silently, wordlessly, asking him to hold me. This went on for hours, until my throat became hoarse and my body was exhausted. I tucked my back against his scrawny chest, sinking into the bed with him. The moment I pulled his arm around me my body decided it couldn’t sustain me for another moment–for the last time, I fell asleep in Dad’s embrace. 

When I woke up, I first noticed the sun peaking out over the treetops. I realized how warm it felt. Almost immediately afterwards, my notice of Dad’s icy skin interrupted any pleasant delusions. Sitting up, I looked over to his bedside table, and saw several bottles of sleeping pills. Next to them sat an envelope. Inscribed, in his favorite pen, were the words;

*To JJ, my pride, my future, and my best friend. I love you, and I will for eternity. If I ever go, please stay here.*

*--*

When I was ten and a half years old, my father laid in his bed, took as many pills as he could swallow, and passed away.

When my mother found us wrapped up in bed it actually took her a moment to realize. She had been, understandably, put off by the smell but then again, some things are just too horrific to accept–I know that more than anyone. Her brain, even just for that brief moment, had to deny the implication of me, curled up in his arms; especially to avoid confronting the fact that it wouldn’t have happened if she were home. Unknowingly, her eyes avoided looking into the face of my father; in fact, they were entirely closed as she smiled at what appeared to be an affectionate embrace.

\--

Eighteen years later, I stood under a cloudy sky in a cemetery in Maine–hallucinating visions of the last night I spent with him; the creature that he became. Shifting my vision towards his grave, I think I can now see what he meant in his poem to Angie. My fingers ran across the aging words:

*“In our youth we fly…*

*I have come to much prefer the nest.”*

Dad was not able to live a normal life, not as a child or a young man, not even when his heart had been “filled.” Despite preferring the nest, the bird flew into the sun. Here, hand resting upon this lovely stone, I wondered how good the flight must have felt.

\--

The fall breeze traversed the folds of my pajamas, forcing itself against my most vulnerable points.  In response, my brain began to conjure the words of my favorite work in Dad’s collection of poetry. It was untitled and had been written urgently on an unfolded pregnancy test package with an expiration date in the year of my birth. His penmanship was different, too–there was a suggestion of excitement in the bouncy lettering;

*She twirled the fresh curls in her finger,* 

*flashing a toothy grin as the waitress circled with a fresh pot of bitter “Colombian” coffee.*

*Her smile lingered.*

*On each tooth I saw a different reality,*

*One with magical spells,* 

*or one where humans were roughly 15 feet tall…*

*In one we were Adam and Eve,*

*and in another there was only one difference; I had an extra toe.*

*Some had alien invasions, dictatorships, or whatever else I could imagine.*

*Only one thing was always there; all of our potential worlds revealed an image of two Moons above our heads.*

*I would stretch my neck to stare up at them,*

*whirling and circling each other in the most beautiful dance.*

*Each basking in the other’s glow.*

*I looked up into her eyes and saw the same beautiful Moons.*

*I asked her;*

*“Do you know how the Moon came to be?”*

*I never got an answer, she just kept on smiling*

The tragedy of the Moon, a broken fragment of the Earth that it longs to rejoin, began to overwhelm my thoughts as I suffered through the wind’s penetrating, bitter gnawing against my skin. I wondered how he wrote so much of my life story, our life story, in just a few lines of a poem. A life spent floating in his orbit had prevented me from ever becoming more than a memento of his legacy–a body made from a chunk of his own, unable to ever even replicate his image. It has come time to break my orbit, for our waltz to change.

Right now, I bet his wings are begging to rest as he heads into the Sun. His whole life he searched for its warmth, always too far to reach.

While he travels, hoping only to be embraced by that celestial body, I will still be waiting here, remembering his fading heat as I fell asleep on our last night together. I hope you find it, Dad. Maybe, for the first time, the warmth that escaped from your skin your whole life will be replenished.

\--

Uncertain what to do now, I laid down next to his grave, hoping that at the very least my body heat would reach him through the dirt. As the wind raged, harder and harder, I somehow felt entirely comfortable. I began to feel as if my body was sinking into the ground, and as my eyes gently shut, I began to dream.

*I open my eyes to see the Earth, plunged in a dark void–the unending blackness only interrupted by countless stars in the backdrop. My hands raise involuntarily, reaching out in front of me. I examine them as they desperately grasp towards the Earth.* 

*These hands are not mine, I think, they’re far too small. Inquisitively, I look at the body I’m attached to–it’s no different.* 

*A smile grows across my face as I realize I’m wearing my favorite t-shirt, a gift from my Dad. In bold font, the words “Redwood National Park” hover above a print of the tallest trees in the world. He bought it for me on a trip we took together shortly after my parents found out they were having another child. My eyes take in the ground below; somehow I’m on the Moon.*

*I blink–when I open my eyes I’m on the Earth, now looking back at where I just stood. My hands begin to wave; first at the Moon, and then at a lonesome bird overhead.*

My hand continued to wave until I felt someone grab my shoulder, shaking me. Looking back, I saw my mother, crying. I could feel the nurturing heat from the Sun soaking into my skin; softly, my eyes opened as I left behind my first new dream since childhood.

“Hi..” I muttered, still dazed. I realized I was crying.

“I saw what happened in the bathroom… come home, please.”

I cast a glance toward the tree line. Through my teary eyes, I couldn’t tell if the figure that still stood there was real.

I once again see her facial expressions from that first visit to the cemetery–the rage, the hurt, the loneliness–and I now remember the look she gave me when I read the quote in my father’s voice–she was terrified. I wondered if she had ever planned to give me that letter, only to decide against it when she realized why my likeness to my father scared him so much. Unfortunately for all of us, I found Angie’s first and kept it hidden, driving myself into the belief that I was the only one forgotten.

There is no doubt in my mind that the words I have been searching for are sealed inside that dusty envelope. Maybe I’ll read it one day–I’m sure Mom will give it to me if I ask–but today, I think my memories are enough to tell me all that I need.

\--

Dad… I forgive you, so please, go to that warmth that you need. Keep searching higher and higher, far away from here. You deserve to find whatever it was that was taken from you, fill your heart up as much as you can.

Part of me will always be here, sealed away– a child, terrified by the pines, hearing the static of your old television, falling asleep in your limp arms. Today, as I stood six feet above you but millions of miles away, I realized I don’t mind that so much. Honestly, I just wish you could see the sun emerging from the clouds above Mom and me. As it does, the light cascades between the trees, revealing the deep, unexplored woods–they have always been there waiting for me. Those dark, impenetrable curtains are finally wide open, and the Sun is shining so brightly. I can still see the imitation of you, its twisted face barely peeking at me from behind a tree. I wonder how long it will be before it beckons me back into the dark.",1,1750965078.0,u_PotentialPhase7966,0,1.0,False

It’s almost 3am. I def should be asleep (and you should too especially with school starting again). But I just talked to a friend, and I realised we have such similar struggles. we both keep feeling like we’re not doing enough. And I know we’re not the only ones. 

So if you need to hear this, you are doing enough. Poly makes it feel like if we’re not constantly burned out, we’re slacking. Like if our GPA don’t reflect our effort, then maybe we didn’t try hard enough. But that’s not true. No matter how hard you try, it still feels like you’re falling short. and sometimes it takes someone else to remind you that you aren’t. So I’ll be that person now. You’re doing enough. 
Even if your gpa isn’t where you want it to be. Even if you’re barely making it through the day. Even if you’re just surviving on a fuckton of Monster, coffee, or misusing pre workout💀 I see you. Waking up after barely sleeping, Stressing over exams, groupmates, deadlines, CCAs,worrying about your future, feeling like you’re behind. You’re juggling so much. And I see it. Maybe it’s part time jobs, gym goals, relationships (lucky bastards), family issues, or maybe just trying to hold yourself together and not fucking explode. That counts. We’re doing what we can with what we have. And that’s more than enough. 

Please don’t let this fucked system convince you that you have to destroy your mental health to prove your worth. Breathe. Take a break if you need it. You’re allowed to rest. You’re allowed to be lost af and still be figuring it out. 

Most importantly, you’re allowed to ask for help. 

We’re all just doing our best to survive. I see it. Trust me, we all feel it too. You’re doing enough. Maybe more than enough. 
Please rest well and take care of yourself. You’ve done enough. I’m proud of you.

1ll8pi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1ll8pi9/3_months_in_scared/,3 months in - scared,"Hello every-miserable-one (and those who have healed and stayed for the miserable once - welcome too). This is my 12 week, look up for my older post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1l0tdxz/2\_months\_update\_not\_yet\_good/](https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1l0tdxz/2_months_update_not_yet_good/) . This updates are more for me, to maybe come here in a year or so a told myself : ""It was sooo shitty"" or ""it wasn't soo bad as it is now"".

**Mental side:**

This month was... strange. I started it with a feeling that I really need a sick leave from my physical job, I was even talking about that with my parents, therapist and that one friend who belives me. Friend and therapist told me ""yes do it"", but my parents were like - "" NOOO YOU NEED TO WORK"" bla bla. I was desperate for words like "" yeah, take a sick leave we will take care of you no matter what will happen we love you"" - or something similar. Then in work at Friday I experienced a nerve pain from my back to my toe - it was burning, but again I did like 8k steps in my work and then I knew I have to stop - I was terrified, so the next day I did MRI and LUCKILY my spine wasn't hit by FQ - it is ""only"" ligament and probably it was so swollen that compressed on nerves. I took a sick leave for 3 weeks, and for 2,5 of it I come back to my parents house. 

First couple days was hell. I wanted die even more than when I was sitting by myself. My dad started yelling that I need PT, I need to move, I need to go to doctors, my mother took his side, so I was just sitting in my room considering to come back and be alone and just waiting for death, I was even prescribed some SSRI (due too my father I went to neuro) and my only thoughts was ""take them, take them and drink vodka - die"". After some days, we started speaking, I show my dad some articles and FINALLY he believed, started even searching for treatments, was angry that some doctors in Poland couldn't help even if familiar with FQ (this doctor is more interested in severe cases...). I was still spending my days on this subreddit. I didn't know how to speak to my menager, but finally I've overcome fear and ask about more desk job - he agreed!. Then I had pain in my thumbs... great, and the pain in my neck also increased so now I will have to probably test mattresses to have pain-free job. I am slowly running of my sick leave and preparing myself to come back to my stressfull - new type job. I dont know how I will make it... Typing hurts... 

Nothing much changed, waking up is the worst moment, my knees, ankles hurt but this is more like 1/10, sometimes during the day in turns into burning in my left knee, my back also hurt and I feel depressed that I have to wake up. I am just laying, doing ""active rest"" and watching the white ceiling considering my future - job, relationships I will never make, parties on which I won't be able to dance... I dont even want to drink anymore, fear of relapse will be too big. I have vision of myself becoming homeless, and not being able to beg for money because I would have to move my arms (it causes neck pain).

I feel invisibly disabled... what to tell in my job if one day my back will hurt, second my wrist, and third my head... God... How to answear those stupid co-workers questions when Im in pain :-:.

**Most bothering symptoms now:**

\- neck, shoulders pain it is spreading to new muscles in this area - I'm scared of how it works, Im not sitting pain free even, I dont know how I will be working, and how the fuck it is supposed to pass. 

\- lower back pain - since taking active rest approach and buying brace - it improved a little, but max I can make 5k steps in brace (maybe I can more, but NO NO IM NOT SOOO STUPID ANYMORE - no more testing limits which are low), without brace I can move in house 0/10 pain, without brace I am able to SLOWLY like 90-years old person walk for 1,5k during which the pain is 1/10. Im pacing, I want to recover badly.

\- period in month 2 didn't occur, in month 3 was scanty, lasted 4 days instead of 6-7, I checked my hormones and they definately change. Hope it will stabilize and I won't develop any kind of long-lasting thyroid problems. 

\- little knee, ankles, wrists pain 1/10 without certain reason, PACING if I can. 

\- thumbs and right hand pain when I type/text 5/10 very ennoying. 

\- depression, anxiety, OCD, worried about unknown, crying in random moments 9/10. (10/10 will be when I will kill myself)

**Not bothering but existing symptoms:**

TBH : I don't have such a thing. I have one eye-floater called by me BOB who will stay with me till rest of my life <3 Please Bob don't bring more friends into my eyes. 

Im in my parents house which is loud, they vacuum at midnight, work to 3 am, my brother takes random showers at 5 am so it's just loud. I am able to fall asleep again when something wakes me. Since Im not walking that much my morning calf tightness dissapered also. Sometimes I am waking up with numb hand probably due to positions sometimes dry mouth comes back - really got used to it.

**Well there are so many things that decreased and really Im thankfull for it, but now I am in soo much fear because the most painfull onces remain, and are increasing, still appearing... hope that I stop get worse within month or so, and will see even more improvment by month 6.** 

**Flare ups:** I feel like I don't have flare ups. Like I just live in a pain bacause I was sitting badly... Ohh such an irony. 

**Positive things: SICK LEAVE. THAT'S IT.** Oh well and I was able to watch stupid films and yt instead of FQAD stuff but not for long. Tried again 70 ml coffee and instantly have to go to toilet like within a 2 minutes. Then my gut hurt for 4 hours. Nothing serious. Next try in 4 month mark if I will be alive. 

**Personal Events:** don't have a life now, I isolated myself from everyone, Im trying not to move even. Im scared of everything, cannot make a single thing that will make me happy, like REALLY happy, not ""distracted happy"". I would like to be waken up in next 1-2 years and recovered. I'm scared I will be the one who will develop this chronic form of this shit - like it will never pass.

I wonder if people who recovered just did everything to do so - cut their working hours, ordered catering instead of cooking and doing painfull grocerries, came back to their parents, was pacing. This feel impossible, everyone has jobs, duties, families to take care of...

**Treatment:**

Started HBOT I hope it's not too early and it won't make anything worse. I feel like my back hurts less after that but this is temporary. First time I felt mentaly better. 

Still taking and buying new supplements but... I feel like this is too much... I have to stop, there is no cure - Im sticking to Q10, vit c,d,e, magnesium, omega-3, collagen I,II,III. 

For mental health Im talking with my therapist but it feels... useless. I started this therapy when I was normal, and I am not convinced if she is good at OCD, PTSD, chronic illness stuff. But I don't want to change her because I know her for this 3 months and I don't what to convince anyone once again that what I experience is real. 

Still eating mostly anit-inflammatory (which was my father's reason to be furious).

Was completely lost and devastated but met with a family friend who is 60 and has lived with epilepsy his whole life and he gave me some great advice I thought I’d share 

After my seizure a month ago I lost everything; my job, my license, and was damn near close to losing the will to live. Felt like I had to start over and no one understood of could relate to the anxiety this seizure caused in my day to day life. I’m still struggling with being in public but Im learning to accept my new life more and more each day. Met with a family friend for coffee last night and he gave me some valuable tips. (Hes had seizures every couple months his whole life, stopped driving at 45 after having 2 separate seizures while on the road, lucky to not severely injured himself or others) 

-epilepsy is the perfect reason to transform your life. Moderate your drinking (if at all). Get a gym membership. Set new bedtime routines. Learn a new skill or hobby. Switch your career. Take care of your body and your mind first and foremost. 

- let everyone in your circle know about your epilepsy. There’s no need to call an ambulance unless it’s longer than 5mins. I’ll wake up and be a little groggy for a bit but I’m okay. Your friends and family love having you around. They’d rather you show up and have a seizure than blow them off.

- if it happens it happens. You’re going to wake up. And if you don’t you won’t even know about it. Don’t let epilepsy stop you from doing what you love. Hiding from the world and isolating yourself will only have a negative impact on your well being.

- everyone has something going on. People are taking anxiety, depression, blood pressure etc pills like they’re candy. Yeah epilepsy is different but it is extremely rare to meet someone who isn’t taking pills for anything in this day and age. 

- the right people will stay by your side or won’t leave because of a medical condition. Anyone who left you behind because of epilepsy wasn’t worth it from the beginning. 

- pick yourself up, dust yourself off and do the best you can with the cards you’ve been dealt. This sucks for all of us who have this crap disease. But life isn’t a competition, do what makes you happy and enjoy the time you’ve been given. 

Sorry if any of these come off brash. He’s kind of an old school character lol. I hope to one day reach the level of acceptance he is at. Good luck to everyone!

Everything was different for me in high school, i did had several crushes but got to forget them and have time for myself, but as usual got a new crush once i went to high, she is very preety, fun, bit shy as well but a cool girl to be friends with as well. It started small, ofc we were getting to knew each other and other classmates as well. One month later she became more open with me, saying hi with big smile and wave, sometimes a kiss blew and small conversations. Then there were weird periods of time where she would be all happy and cool, and then the next all moody and gray. I kinda fell from her due to her finding a boyfriend, but once they broke up she was at me again, that time calling me her fav, blewing many kisses, usual conversations ect. Once we go out from school, she ignored everyone and went home like a flash. Her bestie would also hop in but more like a joke ofc. I remember one time they w were talking to friend of my and i teased him that she likes you, her bestie replied that she likes me instead and that she cried all night long, wich she desperately denied and went to squabble. Spring break came and went away, i came normally and they said about her ex coming back, i was bit depressed then but healed. Now in final week she and other classmates went to sit on a bench, ofc me and friend messed with em in a friendly way, one girl said to leave, we played sad ofc but she replied that she will talk to me. Week went on, we always talked about the coffee but never had any, i wanted to invite her on my family's ranch where no of our friends would see us, thus there was a coffee, but it wasnt successful. I was sad for a bit but ehh life goes on i guess, i do have my own options and from my experience i know what to do then, after i flirted with the cook of an local restourant and one visitor from other country.

After the war, the ship landed quiet.  
Steel on steel, the kind of sound you feel in your knees.  
He walked down the ramp, head low, bag on shoulder.  
Crowds stood behind the fence. Faces close, hopeful, tired.  
Some held signs, some flowers, some nothing.  
He looked at them without stopping.  
Then he turned, glanced back at the ship, maybe one last time.

A woman leaned toward him, a cloth apron tied at her waist.

“Need more coffee?” she asked, already reaching for the pot.

The cup in front of him was chipped near the rim.  
There was music playing low, and someone was coughing near the door.  
A fan spun lazily on the ceiling, ticking with each turn.  
She poured without waiting for an answer, steam curling in the yellow light.  
Outside, rain tapped against the window.  
He watched it for a moment, not really thinking.  
She smiled and moved on to the next table.  
His hand rested near the cup but didn’t lift it.  
The chair across from him was empty.  
He stared at it, not moving, as if it might fill itself.

A breeze moved the trees, and she sat down across from him.  
Her coat was too thin for the season.  
She tucked her hands under her thighs and smiled like they’d been talking for hours already.  
Birds called out above them, loud and invisible.  
The bench creaked slightly under her weight.  
Leaves shifted across the gravel path.  
She crossed her legs, uncrossed them, then rested her elbows on her knees.  
“I thought you’d say no,” she said.  
He didn’t answer right away.  
A child shouted somewhere in the distance, chasing nothing.  
He looked at her shoes. Scuffed. Ordinary. Real.  
The sun was low and gold, soft around the edges.  
Someone was playing guitar nearby, badly but with heart.  
“I almost did,” he replied.  
She smiled wider this time, but not too wide.  
“Why didn’t you?”  
He shrugged, looking past her for a moment, into the trees, into something else.  
“I don’t know,” he said.  
And he meant it.  
A pause held between them, warm and safe.  
She reached over and flicked something off his sleeve.  
He watched her hand as if he didn’t recognize it.

Then he was holding it.  
Her fingers curled inside his palm, small and uncertain.  
The sky behind her was different now, deeper, violet, touched with stars.  
Streetlights flickered to life.  
He raised her hand a little, slowly, like he was testing gravity.  
“Will you marry, me?” he asked softly, not quite smiling.  
The ring was already between his fingers.  
He didn’t remember buying it.  
He slid it on without ceremony.  
It fit.  
Her other hand came up to her mouth, but she didn’t speak.  
Wind pushed through the trees behind them.  
Somewhere, a car passed, headlights drifting by like ghosts.  
They stood beneath a statue, he didn’t know what it was of.  
She stepped forward and put her head against his chest.  
He looked over her shoulder, into the nothing beyond the square.  
She didn’t say yes.  
She didn’t need to.

Her hand gripped his tighter, suddenly, sharply  
a breath caught in her throat, the kind that doesn't come from surprise but from pain.  
The light above them was white now.  
Too white. Too still.  
Machines hummed somewhere behind the walls.  
She was lying down.  
He was kneeling beside her, his other hand on her forehead.  
She was sweating, jaw clenched, eyes locked on nothing.  
Someone said, *“Almost there.”*  
He nodded, but no one had spoken to him.  
Her hand crushed his fingers.  
She screamed once, short and low.  
Then it was over.  
Just a sound, wet, new, impossible.  
A cry, small and angry.  
She let go of him, only then.  
He stood there, not knowing when he had stood.  
A nurse, or maybe a stranger, handed him the child.  
Wrapped in white. Red-faced. Breathing.  
He looked down and didn’t recognize his own eyes in the baby's face.  
But he smiled anyway.  
She reached up, her fingers brushing the child’s cheek.

He viped cream from them,  
sticky with icing.  
He laughed with his mouth open, full of cake,  
crown tilted sideways on a mop of sunlit hair.  
The yard buzzed with quiet joy, paper streamers fluttering in the breeze.  
She sat beside him at the table, one hand resting on her belly,  
watching him tear through wrapping paper with wild delight.  
The sun dappled through the trees, and shadows stretched slow across the lawn.  
A toy train circled endlessly on its track.  
Someone turned up the radio.  
Neighbors clapped. A dog barked twice and was never seen again.  
He stood at the edge of the porch,  
holding a half-deflated balloon and a plastic cup of lukewarm juice,  
watching his son run, trip, get up again,  
laughing like he had never fallen.  
She looked over her shoulder and said,  
“He doesn’t stop, does he?”  
He shook his head and smiled,  
but his eyes never left the boy.  
And the world, like breath between sentences,  
held still for just one more second.

 

“Just one more!” someone yelled,  
and her whole body pushed against the bed,  
teeth bared, eyes shut tight.  
The room smelled of sweat and bleach and too much light.  
He was beside her again, gripping her hand like it could hold the world together.  
The nurse moved fast, too fast, no face, just motion.  
The cry came smaller this time, softer, but still sharp enough to cut the silence.  
She collapsed into the pillow, trembling.  
The doctor smiled, he thought it was the doctor,  
and said something, but he didn’t hear it.  
A second baby. A girl.  
Wrapped and warm and red-faced.  
Her tiny hand opened and closed like she was already dreaming.  
He looked at her,  
then at the boy’s empty chair in the corner.  
He had forgotten how small they start.  
She turned her head, sweat in her hair, and whispered,  
“She’s early.”  
He nodded.  
She wasn’t.  
She was right on time.

 

“Just right on time,” he said again,  
his voice quieter now,  
hands folded in his lap, suit slightly wrinkled,  
the weight of years sitting with him on the church steps.  
The bell hadn’t rung yet.  
The wind played with flower petals along the walkway,  
lifting them like memories.  
He looked up as the door creaked open.  
She stood there, veiled and glowing, her arm looped through his.  
She didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to.  
He rose slowly, knees stiff,  
and took her hand like he’d done a thousand times before.  
The music started, low, trembling, unsure of itself.  
They walked side by side,  
her steps steady, his measured.  
He stared straight ahead,  
but felt her glance up at him once, just once.  
The aisle stretched ahead, wide and golden,  
lined with faces he almost recognized.  
He blinked slowly,  
and for a moment she was five again,  
frosting on her cheeks, crown on her head.  
He smiled, just enough to keep from crying.  
They reached the altar.  
He placed her hand in another’s.  
And let go.

 

“Let it go!” a child shouted, somewhere close.  
Laughter. Small feet pounding across the floor.  
“Grandma, they’re running again!”  
She was already standing, waving them toward the table.  
“Come on, come on, it’s time.”  
The chairs scraped gently across the floor.  
He sat down last, hands folded, watching.  
Plates clinked. Someone poured juice.  
The cake was set down, slightly tilted, candles waiting.  
A match flared. Orange light flickered across familiar faces.  
His grandson leaned in, eyes wide, “Make a wish, Grandpa.”  
He smiled.  
Everyone smiled.  
He drew a breath,  
leaned in...

**SIREN.**

**A cold AI voice blured.**

**“All units. Prepare for combat reintegration. Five hours to frontline.”**

His eyes opened.

Blue light. Cold air. Metal walls.  
The hiss of the crono pod releasing.  
Fluid drained around his boots.  
His hand moved slowly to his face.  
Fingers pressed into his eyes, wiped nothing away.  
He sat there for a long time.  
Then said,  
“I hate crono pods.”  
A pause. A breath.

I can’t find anyone with the exact same problem in which simple solutions didn’t fix the issue. I’ll be as descriptive as I possibly can and hopefully someone can help. 

When I brew an 8 oz cup, the coffee comes out normal for about 3-4 oz, there is a pause, and then the keurig proceeds to spew coffee in every direction - making a total mess. 

In this process, there is a large accumulation of grounds, probably half of the K-cup or so. 

I have taken out the brew basket, cleaned the needles , ran anything you can imagine through the machine to get it cleaned out. The water comes out crystal clear, not a single ground. 

I’ll run another cup and it’s the same exact issue. It’s worth noting that there is a huge mess in the brew basket as well, above the K-cup and all inside the housing where the Keurig arm comes down to meet the cup. 

I’m open to any suggestions about what to do, including cleaning the needles out better, which is what I’ll do in the meantime. If I don’t resolve this today- I’m just going to be a new one. 

One thing I will say is that around Christmas, people gifted me bags of coffee and I used reusable K-cups to brew this coffee. I theorize that this had something to do with it, because I never had issues before. ",2,1750964055.0,keurig,3,1.0,False

My doctor put me on Brimonidine, Latanoprost and Acetazolamide. Insurance doesn’t cover anything else. My IOP has been steadily at mid to high 20s since, even despite receiving SLT in both eyes. 

My doctor recommends getting a Trabeculectomy next month now. I’m pretty scared of this; the recovery time, the higher chance of infection as a diabetic with not great blood sugar numbers, being able to feel the bleps forever, etc. 

My instinct is to sit on all this for a while; continue eye drops, continue making lifestyle changes (more exercise, less salt and coffee), getting a cpap for my bad sleep apnea. Maybe get the surgery next year. 

Should I ignore my fears and go ahead with the Trab asap knowing ultimately it will be best for my vision? Or are the risks of the surgery outcome not worth it yet for someone who is 37 and has IOP #s in the 20s instead of higher.

1ll8cek,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1ll8cek/betterme_cutting_meal_prep_guide_for_beginners/,BetterMe: Cutting Meal Prep Guide for Beginners,"Cutting is all about **losing fat while preserving muscle**, and your meals should reflect that. Whether you're prepping for the week or just one dinner, here’s what a solid cutting meal looks like — plus what to avoid to stay on track.

# ✅ What a Good Cutting Meal Looks Like

**Goal**: High protein + fiber, healthy fats, and slow-digesting carbs for fullness and muscle retention.

**Example Meal:**

* **Grilled Chicken Breast (4–5 oz)** – Lean, muscle-preserving protein
* **Steamed Broccoli + Roasted Sweet Potatoes (1 cup each)** – Fiber, vitamins, and slow carbs
* **¼ Avocado** – Healthy fats to keep you full
* **Seasoning + 1 tsp Olive Oil** – Flavor without excess calories

**Macros in action**:

* 🥩 **Protein** = muscle retention
* 🍠 **Complex Carbs** = energy + fullness
* 🥦 **Fiber** = digestion + satiety
* 🥑 **Healthy Fats** = hormonal balance + satisfaction

**Swap ideas**:

* Protein: turkey, cod, tofu, chickpeas
* Carbs: quinoa, brown rice, farro
* Veggies: spinach, Brussels sprouts, asparagus

**Pro Tip**: Weigh your portions to align with your calorie/macro goals, especially on active vs. rest days.

# 🚫 What to Avoid During a Cut

Not all calories are created equal. Here are the **top 7 foods that can sabotage your cut**:

1. **Sugary Drinks** – Empty calories, no satiety 🔄 Try: water, herbal tea, black coffee, flavored sparkling water
2. **Processed Snacks (chips, cookies)** – Low in nutrients, high in cravings 🔄 Try: boiled eggs, Greek yogurt, raw nuts
3. **Fried Foods** – Calorie-dense, poor nutrition 🔄 Try: air-fried or baked versions
4. **Sugary Desserts** – Spike blood sugar and cravings 🔄 Try: protein balls, fruit with yogurt, dark chocolate
5. **White Bread/Pasta/Rice** – Low fiber, less filling 🔄 Try: whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, or whole wheat
6. **Alcohol** – Empty calories, affects fat metabolism + sleep 🔄 Try: sparkling water with lime, dry wine in moderation
7. **Cheese/Heavy Cream Sauces** – High in fat + calories 🔄 Try: Greek yogurt for sauces, nutritional yeast for cheesy flavor

# 💥 Should You Work Out While Cutting?

**Absolutely.** Exercise supports fat loss, muscle retention, and overall health.

**Include:**

* 🏋️ **Strength Training (3–4x/week)** – Essential for keeping muscle
* 🏃 **Cardio (3–4x/week)** – Aids fat loss & heart health
* 🧘 **Mobility/Flexibility Work** – Prevents injury & aids recovery

**Balance workouts with:**

* At least 1–2 rest days/week
* Proper protein + carb intake post-workout
* Listening to your body (avoid overtraining)

# ❓ Meal Prep FAQs

* **Is rice safe to meal prep?** ✔️ Yes – cool quickly, store airtight, eat within 4 days or freeze.
* **Can you prep scrambled eggs?** ✔️ Yes – eat within 3–4 days, slightly undercook before storage.
* **Can chicken be prepped for a week?** ✔️ Store up to 4 days in the fridge; freeze the rest for later.
* **Cons of meal prep?**
   * Takes time
   * Can get repetitive
   * Requires proper storage 👉 Mitigate with variety, batch-freezing, and efficient scheduling.

**Meal prep doesn’t have to be rigid.**  
Stay flexible — switch proteins, rotate veggies, adjust to your cravings. Cutting is about **consistency over perfection.**

But when I count, it feels hard to “diet” or eat in moderation, and still get above 1500. I’ll use what I ate today as an example:

Breakfast:
Toast (105) with butter (~1/2 teaspoon = 51) and a 22 gram slice ham (34). + a cup of dark coffee (20)

Lunch:
1 cup cooked rice (~192) with sausage (117), one dl peas (62) and sauce (~130)

Snack:

Dinner: 
100g fries (according to the bag, 185), with 5 nuggets (275) and two teaspoons dressing (55) 


It adds up to about 1496 kcal. This is with what id consider a ”cheat” meal today for dinner, too. Am I underestimating and accidentally eating too much? Or am I eating too little and need to make my portions bigger? Or does it seem reasonable?

I was taking two different meds both at high doses to get to the high end of normal range, and my doctor lectured me about my weight. I did lose the excess weight (by obsessive calorie counting) but BP remained unchanged. Then I got lectured about coffee and salt (No salt!! No coffee!!).
I gradually regained the weight. Now on tirz my BP has dropped dramatically. It was unexpected, and I only realized it when I felt faint on standing a few times early on. This isn’t just weight related as I’m just 30% of the way to goal.

1ll88yr,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1ll88yr/advice_about_outing_myself/,Advice about outing myself,"I invited my niece and her husband over for the 4th of July weekend. Her parents (my sis & BIL) are very TBM as far as I know, and so is she. I am only recently out and have not told my parents or any extended family (we live far from everyone else). 

I have just barely started wearing tank tops but am trying to normalize that for myself (it's weird to me and to my children/spouse). I have been drinking coffee for several months now, but usually just at the gym in the mornings. 

So my question, looking for advice -- what are pros and cons of hiding my apostasy vs embracing it while she is here? I am so new that I could easily just not drink coffee and wear sleeves w/o much inconvenience,  so she wouldn't know unless she garment checks me (possible I guess?)?

This would keep me able to present my news on my own timetable with each family member as I want to... on the other hand, maybe this is a good way to  introduce the news to extended family? 

I really don't know whether she would say anything or not, my guess is if she did it would be to her mom (who I rarely talk to) -- who then might say something to our parents. Which would all then be an awkward but amusing dance of them trying to find out/ask me about it w/o betraying that they are talking about me. 

It also might be a way to signal to my niece that maybe she is more free concerning church things than she was raised to believe? Although I have no idea if she is even anywhere on the questioning continuum. 

(That is also a weight on the side of coming out more generally -- for my extended family to know if they are questioning,  that they are not alone. Of course,  that could also lead to my sibs/parents trying to protect their children from my heresy, so who knows?) 

Anyway I would love to hear what others think/advise/recommend/have experienced and if I am missing important considerations? ",8,1750963765.0,exmormon,5,0.91,False
1ll88lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1ll88lz/ross_vs_booth/,Ross ($$) vs Booth,"Hey Redditors,

I'm feeling really conflicted about making a decision between Booth and Ross. I'm incredibly grateful for both options, but I've been going back and forth between them.

I'm a 30+ y/o male with 9+ years of experience in healthcare, looking to pivot into consulting before eventually transitioning into product management in tech or health tech.

Ross offered me a generous scholarship ($$), while Booth unfortunately didn’t offer any funding, despite my attempt to negotiate.

I can genuinely see myself at either school. I love Chicago, but I also know I’d enjoy my time in Ann Arbor. Both schools offer very different teaching styles and communities.

**Academics:**  
I see Booth’s flexible, customizable curriculum as a big plus. That said, Ross’s structured core is also appealing—one less thing to figure out while adjusting to business school.

**Community:**  
I like how tight-knit Ross is, but I’m confident I’d find my people at Booth as well. Chicago’s large LGBTQIA+ community is another important consideration for me.

**Consulting/Tech Outcomes:**  
The difference here seems marginal. Both schools have strong consulting placement. Tech is obviously in a rough patch right now, but I still believe opportunities exist at either program.

**Student/Alumni Network & Global Brand:**  
In my experience, every Ross alum has gotten back to me and made time for a coffee chat. I’ve found it more difficult to get a response from current Booth students and alumni. That said, Booth’s global brand could be helpful if I ever decide to transition to UK in the future.

**Repayment/Loans:**  
I am older than most MBA students, and the idea of spending another 5–10 years paying off loans feels stressful. I’m also thinking about quality of life immediately post-MBA.

Open and grateful for any thoughts or advice. Thank you!",1,1750963742.0,MBA,4,1.0,False

We’ve talked on and off throughout the years. Always flirting but never really saying we’re dating until the past year. We don’t have a date for it, we’ve just felt it for so long and agreed to it. Within the past two years we’ve revealed our names and have each other on social media and voice and video call everyday. Is he the love of my life? I don’t know who I am anymore. I really really really need help. i feel like i’ve been brainwashed into thinking everything we have is true love. if it is true love you would want anything with the other person, you only want the other person. maybe in some ways yes. i’m not sure i want this anymore. i had a sickening gut feeling last night where i couldn’t sleep at all. the day he buys me tickets to come see him in europe for a month. a family trip. i was begging my parents for a week to let me go. they had a lot of concerns but in the end approved it. we met for the first time two weeks ago in paris. it was somewhat something out of a movie. we ran up to each other in the street and hugged. we had our first kiss together. it wasn’t awkward at all. when we first started calling it wasn’t awkward, everything flowed. it always has. we don’t ever stop talking. in person, everything came natural. the only thing that took me by surprise a little was that he touched me a lot in those places. we were both super “freaky” over text. i think i liked it in the moment? 

but here are things that bring up my concern, i wrote down a list, it’s really messy:

started showing up late to school everyday. just by a few minutes. but he would wake me up on call every morning which was sweet and i’d end up being late because we talked but he’d say it’s okay. so i kept being late. my parents hated it. he told me to stop studying and not to care for school. because we’d run away or move together soon. i listened. i’m an A+ student and got B’s this year. I’m questioning career vs love.  I don’t know what to pick. i wanted to be a doctor. in paris, which was my birthday present from my family for my 17th, i obviously wanted to go see everything. the only thing i saw was the Eiffel tower. me and him planned up meeting  in paris secretly, since he lives in europe. doesn’t matter though. he has a health condition that makes it painful to walk. i stayed at the hotel everyday when my family went out so we could just call. he wouldn’t have liked it if i went with them because i should prioritize him and stay with him. my parents met him there though, we all had dinner together every night but me and him would do our own thing throughout the day. was i happy? i want to ask my mom that. there were definitely good moments and bad moments with him. every time we were alone he’d kiss and touch me. like the love i feel so deeply and the pain hurts so bad. i feel like my life is ruined with school. i feel like paris ruined for me. maybe i can go again when i’m old. maybe im in the wrong because he has a health condition. he lives the lifestyle i always said i wanted to get away from. my dad is pretty cluttered. clutter to the point you can’t walk around. he has stained sheets and crumbs on his bed. i asked him if it was okay that we dont have passions. he said it was okay because we are each others passion. gaming doesn’t appeal to him anymore only i do. and that’s romantic. but i’m used to playing like three sports at once. i’m not taking care of myself anymore, not cleaning, he doesn’t like when i clean my room because it takes hours away from us. i don’t do my skincare anymore. not sure what i want/prioritize compared to his of only wanting each other and nothing else. in the ideal setting it’s love over money right? but i don’t know if i’m happy, and you follow your happiness right. my grandma said i won’t like it there (she’s from europe) i live in a middle class home in the united states and this part of europe which he loves is more run down. went from calling once in a while, texting everyday to literally calling 24/7 we don’t ever hang up like my screen time is 24 hours. lying to my parents about my lifestyle, saying friends are mean so i left them, studying in europe when the plan is to not study at all when i was always school oriented. months ago when i was watching movies with friends i craved him the only thing i wanted was to cuddle with him, is it bad that that’s the only thing i would really want?? not the sexy stuff. not even sure myself. i feel loved by him, the way he looks at me and holds me and touches my face, he only wants me only looks at me, we went shopping and he picked out longer shorts for me because he doesn’t want a lot of skin showing which makes me feel loved and gave me his belt because they were a little loose like he is a romantic. he makes me feel beautiful and more confident which i’ve always struggled with. i talked to him this morning and i still have some love for him. is it bad i like parts of the controlling?  i’ve sent photos of myself so i’m a little nervous about that too. he has them saved.

more about him:

is our age gap weird? does it make him creepy? his biggest value is exclusivity, we’d be on the edge of breaking up when i went out with friends, he wants be number one and to be chosen over my family and friends and everything else, but for true love you are each others number one so it makes sense? said our passion is each other we’re the only thing we need in each others lives our only priority. he’s quitting college for us to work for our future life. spent a lot of money on me on dinner and at the store. said we’d work fast food together, same shifts, low money because we’re so in love. doesn’t want to go swimming because of a sun burn he got 7 years ago (i think this is related more to insecurity, hasn’t been said out loud, which makes me bad) but we argue over this and so many other things that always end up resolved though. am i in love or do i like being loved? still argued in person i thought it would go away, silence in person. interesting and very unique kinks but it makes me feel loved because he loves every single thing about me nothing about me is gross. when we met he touched me and i liked it, we were both super into it over text but like it wasn’t the perfect meeting in a way, also in the elevator. wants to have sex everyday and says i should want it too because if you’re in love you always want it with your person, you would never turn them down. when i say no he gets upset. when i said no to in person with no protection he got upset. he says God will decide if we have a baby or not, a kink is to get me pregnant? i never got a face reveal until in person, i said i was okay with it, i saw his eyes and lips and hair and pieces on snapchat with filters. pick me boy? hello kitty filters and saying he has green eyes when hazel, we can only listen to his music one artist because old artists i have memories with the bad people (old friends) scared of heights, can’t walk over vents on the street, scared of bugs, scared of needles. maybe it makes me look bad but it comes of icky to me. bought me thousand dollar flight tickets  to go to europe in a few weeks, for a month, for a family trip, my parents took a while to say yes to it, everyone knows each other online, my family and his. engraved into my brain that this is true love, unconditional love, chasing money is worldly, we’re getting out of the rat race, the normal lifestyle. things were never awkward, never when we had a fave reveal, never in person, everything flowed. we have the same religion (christian) which i don’t have people in my life who relate to that, same culture, my moms from europe, he’s from europe, no one in america can relate to the culture aspect and tradition, i’m no one’s best friend, all my “best friends” clearly have their best friend, i feel fully heard with him, i feel fully known by him, my parents don’t know me as well friends don’t me as well i have never been as known. we talk 24/7 on the phone our phone calls go 72+ hours we sleep call this is why i can’t go out because we call literally every second.

final thoughts:

our life plan was to meet in paris for a week, run away together and our lives together because we want to go to God. it was a scary idea at first but i agreed to it. i really need help with all of this, i don’t think ill ever mention this part to anyone in person. our new plan is i move to him after i graduate and we live for a year off saved money and then die together. i don’t know what made me doubt all of this. last night i had a gut wrenching feeling, i couldn’t sleep at all and started writing this. my friends coming over uninvited, concerned, looking at my pinterest board of my dream life? i don’t know where the change of heart comes from. the question is, can i be alone and happy? can i live in the city in my apartment and go on runs and workout and work a job and drink iced coffee and listen to any music i want and adopt a dog if i’m lonely and hang out with friends? will i ever be fulfilled? can i recover from not going outside for months? i doubt ill have friends as i ghosted them but i can be okay on my own right? can i live without a love? i’m sorry the whole thing is a mess, it’s just bullet points put all together i’m sorry if things are repeated but i need help. i like that we love each other so much that we only want each other and nothing else? but then again some things are extreme and make me feel sick. please please please help me.",1,1750963650.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

Alright, community, let’s spill the tea ☕! We’re all on this journey of self-improvement, but sometimes it’s the smallest tweaks that end up making the biggest waves in our lives. I’m talking about those little changes that felt almost insignificant at first, but then turned into total game-changers. 

Here’s a little micro-change that flipped my life upside down: **switching my morning routine.** 🙌

### Here’s what I did:
1. **Woke up 10 minutes earlier** – I know, I know. You’re rolling your eyes right now. But hear me out! Those extra minutes gave me time to breathe, stretch, and NOT jump straight into the chaos.
   
2. **Gratitude journaling** – The first thing I did with those precious 10 minutes? Jotted down three things I was thankful for. Honestly, some days it was as simple as “coffee exists” ☕, but it shifted my whole mindset.

3. **Skipping my phone** – That’s right! No TikToks or endless scrolling first thing in the morning. Instead, I replaced it with a quick check-in on my goals or an inspiring podcast.

4. **Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate** 💧 – Downing a glass of water before even thinking about breakfast. Who knew H2O could work wonders for my energy levels?

### The result?
I started my day feeling like a rock star instead of a zombie. Suddenly, the morning grind felt a little less *grindy*. It’s all about those **small wins**, right? And the best part? This micro-change set a positive tone for the rest of my day.

But enough about me—what about YOU? I wanna hear your stories. 

### Some things to think about:
- What tiny change did you make that exploded into something amazing?
- Did it improve your productivity, relationships, or maybe even your sense of self?
- Have you tackled any pesky habits with a simple shift?

Let’s get this conversation flowing because if there’s one thing I know, it’s that *we all have secrets that can spark little fires for those around us!* 🔥",1,1750963631.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’m a 55+ year-old professional man living in Böblingen and I’m feeling pretty stuck in a boring routine: go to work, come home, make dinner, watch TV, go to bed… and repeat. I’m not looking to party hard or date — just really hoping to connect with people and start doing more with my free time. If I were in the UK I’d probably be down at the pub regularly.

I’d love to meet others (any age really, but especially people 40+) to:
	•	Explore local events, markets, or museums
	•	Grab a coffee or try out a restaurant or Biergarten 
	•	Go for a walk or a casual day trip or travel
	•	Join a group or take a class (art, cooking, language — I’m open!)
	•	I used to mountain bike a lot but it’s been awhile 😓

I speak very little German (still learning) unfortunately.

If anyone here knows of groups, social clubs, meetups, or even just friendly hangouts in or around Böblingen (or nearby Sindelfingen/Stuttgart), I’d really appreciate any recommendations.

1ll811o,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1ll811o/migraines_get_worse_when_im_out_of_school/,Migraines get worse when im out of school,"Hey yall im 18 and ive been struggling with migraines since I was around 2 years old. As of right now im out of school for the summer and ive noticed my migraines have been getting worse, I realized anytime im on a break from school my migraines jump from maybe 1 a month to multiple a week. This is really confusing because I dont really change my routine when im out of school so there's only 3 differences:

1. I dont really go outside anymore, I ride the city bus to school so im usually outside for a cumulative 2 hours a day when im in school.

2. I take my morning meds later. When im in school I take my meds before leaving so depending on what classes I have (college) I will usually take them between 8am and 9am but when i dont have class (breaks and weekends) I usually take them around 11:30am because thats when I drink my second coffee.

3. I dont wear my glasses. Im very nearsighted but I hate the feeling of wearing my glasses so I only wear them when I actually need to see, so when I go to class or anywhere. 

My dad says its because im not going outside much anymore, is that a plausible reason? Or is it more likely that its because im taking my meds later? Please help me im running out of my eletriptan faster than I can get it refilled.",2,1750963234.0,migraine,2,1.0,False

🚀 ""DEFCON DOUGH: A Metabolic Misadventure""

INT. HMS HOMEOSTASIS – CONTROL ROOM – MORNING
The ship hums quietly. Glucose is lounging in a beanbag, shades on. Insulin is snoring in a chair labeled “Only Clock In After Breakfast.” The system is calm. Too calm.

[ALARM BLARES]
Red lights flash. A klaxon howls.

📢 SYSTEM ALERT: THERAPY AT 10:45 AM. EMOTIONAL STIMULUS DETECTED.

CORTISOL (busting in wearing a general’s jacket)

GLUCOSE (sips from a Capri Sun)
“Chill, Cort. He just had an Apfeltasche. We’re golden.”

CORTISOL (slams fist on control panel)
“Golden?! He just mentioned his dad! Do you want flashbacks with that pastry?!”

GLUCOSE (mutters)
“Here we go…”

Glucose smashes the EMERGENCY LEVER. A flood of sugar is released from the liver's basement vaults.

💥 GLUCOSE LEVEL: SPIKE INCOMING. 💥

CUT TO: PANCREAS BAY – DARK AND DUSTY
Insulin is sleeping under a weighted blanket, mouth open, drooling slightly.

📢 INSULIN, REPORT TO DUTY.

INSULIN (groggy)
“…Whuh? Is it lunch? No? Then screw off. I don’t work overtime for stress.”

📢 CURRENT STATUS: BLOOD GLUCOSE 8.7.

INSULIN (grumbling)
“That’s not my fault. He’s anxious, not eating. Tell Cortisol to calm his ass down.”

BACK IN CONTROL ROOM
CORTISOL (typing frantically)
“He's talking about abandonment schemas! Deploy more glucose! Give him ENERGY! We need to OUTRUN THE FEELINGS!”

YOU (somewhere above deck, mid-therapy)
“…I guess I always felt like I had to be perfect, or—""

BODY (simultaneously)
🚨 FULL SYSTEM OVERRIDE! 🚨
""Protect the child at all costs. Drown it in SUGAR!""

CUT TO: LATER THAT DAY – POST-SESSION
Insulin finally shows up, coffee in hand, sunglasses on.

INSULIN (surveying the sugar flood)
“Ugh. Fine. I’ll clean it up. But I’m writing this down for HR.”

GLUCOSE (floating by on a donut-shaped pool float)
“Next time just show up on time, man.”

CORTISOL (in fetal position whispering)
“…He said he might cry next week…”

When I was working as a chef I worked for a caterer who made coffee cake like this but used a box mix. Today I was craving some and wanted to challenge myself to see if I could recreate it. Honestly wish O had written it all down because it came out way better than I anticipated.

Basically I started with Greek yogurt, watered it down a little, cracked a couple eggs in it, mixed in a stick of melted butter, almost two cups of sugar (it's not health food), a pinch of cinnamon, a dash of vanilla extract, baking soda, and all purpose flour.

I also mixed some white sugar and molasses together until it was kind of wet and sticky (also cinnamon was involved), then I put a base layer of the batter in an oiled loaf pan, slapped some sugar mixture on top, then spooned some batter over it, and finished with a crumb topping I had leftover.

Once baked I just topped it with a glaze made of powdered sugar and milk.

I am just an immigrant male who has been living +5000 Km away from family and home for years now. and really **Anxiety** is a problem of my life in **2025**. Well, I am a real coffee lover . I enjoyed it for like whole my life! 1 or 2 cappuccino a day. it is meaning of pleasure for me!

I am 22 yo and since 15s i had been diagnosed with **SVT tachycardia** that anxiety worsens. but at that time i didnt have such anxiety as i have now this year. it all started when i was diagnosed with **iron def without anemia.** earlier this year. what i can say that i had persistent lightheadness that made my life hard specially with college and living alone. what is happening since then is that each time i drink coffee i get extra lightheadness extra sensations of near fainting. other stuff. well , i treated iron def with doctors and persistent lightheadness is no longer there. but there is something new now .

post iron treatment, I feel myself strange really, I dunno whats wrong. but even people see me and tell me ""is everything okay ?"" , "" are you with us ?"" 

I got some sensations in chest and some symptoms like i cant breath well or i will faint some days ago. called ambulance . did ECG . evaluated me . told me . nothing is dangerous here. this happened even without any coffee or stuff

went to doctor later and described everything. and now I am being treated with some med by this general therapist till next near first visit to a psychiatrist referenced to evaluate me . I am just feeling afraid that I will no longer be able to pass thru this 

want to say that during iron def treatment . I made much of blood analysis and my organs are fine. glucose, cholesterol, thyroid levels. normal ranges 

I started month ago supplementation of magnesium citrate 1100 mg , b6 8 mg and omega 3 (EPA+DHA) 1000mg . 

and L theanine 200 mg prior to coffee actually helps sometimes.

A month ago probably I was walking in Chinatown and I went to grab coffee and payed the bill behind as a kind gesture. This lady (about my age btw) said thank you and we went on our days.

The next weekend I went to a skatepark near the TD garden. Saw her again I said hi and she said hi.

I’ve learned so much from this sub and figured it’s time to give back, especially for other beginners who might be going through the same growing pains I did. Please don’t judge me too harshly!

This is the first post in a short series documenting my home roasting journey. I’ll cover the roasters I’ve used, lessons learned, and hopefully share something useful (or at least mildly entertaining). Up next: the Kaffelogic Nano 7, which was my main roaster for a few years. After that, if I navigate the learning curve, my recent leap to the ROEST.

But let’s start at the very beginning: the humble pan roast.

**A Gift, a Grassy Smell, and a Cast Iron Pan**

It all started when a coworker and fellow cast iron enthusiast gifted me a few bags of Sweet Maria’s green beans. At the time, I was pulling long hours, riding the caffeine train hard, and mostly brewing with Aeropress and Chemex. I’d been exploring different origins through Angel’s Cup, but never thought about roasting.

The beans looked pale green, smelled grassy, and I had no idea what exactly to do with them. So I found Sweet Maria’s Roast Basics guide which is a goldmine for beginners. The visual roast chart alone is incredibly helpful!

**The Roast That Almost Called the Fire Department**

Armed with optimism and zero experience, I tossed some beans in a pan and started stirring. The transformation from green to yellow to brown, the cracks, the aromas - it was magic!

Then there also was the smoke. Even with all windows open, my air purifier turned red and started screaming. I was one bad stir away from triggering the building’s fire alarm. And yet, somehow, the coffee was drinkable. Not good - but drinkable. And I was hooked.

**Takeaways from the Pan**

* It’s fun! Watching the roast change in real time is addictive.
* It teaches you a ton. Seeing (and smelling and hearing) roast development firsthand is invaluable. It is also helpful for later when you are roasting “blind” in the machine.
* Even bad coffee you roast yourself feels like an accomplishment.
* Manual stirring is a workout and can be wildly uneven.
* A proper roaster became very appealing very quickly.
* Smoke is no joke. It’s not great for you. And unless you want to meet your local fire department, roast outside or get good ventilation.

Not long after, I saw a U.S. launch campaign for the Kaffelogic Nano 7, and I jumped on it. But that’s a story for another post.

TL;DR
Would I recommend pan roasting to a beginner? Absolutely, even just once. You’ll learn to recognize first and second crack, see roast stages up close, and gain a whole new appreciation for what a roaster actually does (and why you might want one).  Grab some green beans, read Sweet Maria’s basics, fire up a pan, and see where it takes you. It might just be the start of a whole new obsession.

1ll7hfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ll7hfg/caffeine_blues_review_and_highlights_910/,Caffeine Blues Review and Highlights (9/10),"Everyone should read this book. Caffeine does more than just block adenosine receptors so you don't feel tired. Caffeine = Stress. Would have given it a 10/10 but there is some stuff about supplements that I do not agree with. I tried all of the supplements and they had their own side effects. I am also not able to look at the studies listed so a more modern approach with links would be nice. I have read this 4 times.

---

## Highlights

These are my highlights copied straight from the book with some formatting. There is a lot more info in the book.

### Introduction

Caffeine can’t provide energy, only chemical stimulation, an induced emergency state that can lead to irritability, mood swings, and panic attacks.

Caffeine’s ultimate mood effect can be letdown, which can lead to depression and chronic fatigue.

Caffeine gives the illusion of heightened alertness by dilating pupils, quickening heart rate, and raising blood pressure. In fact, caffeine does not increase overall mental activity.

The drug contributes to palpitations, panic attacks, hypoglycemia, gastritis, fatigue, insomnia, and PMS, to name a few.

Contributes to adrenal exhaustion.

Raises blood cholesterol levels.

Caffeine also raises blood pressure, increases homocysteine (a biochemical that damages artery walls), promotes arrhythmias, and
constricts blood vessels leading to the heart.

*Caffeine gives you energy*. Wrong. Caffeine does not provide energy—only chemical stimulation. The perceived “energy” comes from
the body’s struggle to adapt to increased blood levels of stress hormones.

Role in depression and anxiety

Positively linked to panic attacks,

Users may feel more alert, the experience is simply one of increased sensory and motor activity (dilated pupils, increased heart rate, and
higher blood pressure). The quality of thought and recall is improved no more than the quality of music is improved when played at a higher volume or speed.

Caffeine actually *decreases* overall mental acuity.

Women are at higher risk than men, and children are the most vulnerable to caffeine because of their limited ability to detoxify
the drug.

Peak consumption periods at three, thirteen, and seventeen. These children are set up for a lifetime addiction with serious health
consequences.

Caffeine’s connection to hyperactivity, learning and behavior disorders, fatigue, cancer, heart disease, ulcers, headache, allergy,
PMS, birth defects, and more.

Many of our physical experiences of tension and pain are directly related to the level of stress hormones in our bodies.

Caffeine acts as a pain trigger because it elevates blood levels of these biochemicals.

No scientist can tell you how much caffeine is safe for you to ingest because the effects of caffeine differ significantly from person to
person.

What is tolerable for one person may be excessive for another. Moreover, what is tolerable caffeine intake at one point in your life
may actually cause health problems just a few years later.

I suggest that you try kicking the habit for sixty days—the minimum amount of time you’ll need to evaluate the benefits of a caffeine-free
body and mind.

### Coffee and Caffeine: A Dose of Reality

""We have seen several well-marked cases of coffee excess. … The sufferer is tremulous, and loses his self-command; he is subject to
fits of agitation and depression; he loses color and has a haggard appearance. The apatite falls off, and symptoms of gastric catarrh may
be manifested. The heart also suffers; it palpitates, or it intermits. As with other such agents, a renewed dose of the poison gives
temporary relief, but at the cost of future misery. … By miseries such as these, the best years of life may be spoilt.""

—SIR T. CLIFFORD ALLBUTT and   DR. WALTER ERNEST DIXON in *A System of Medicine*, vol. II, London,
1909

Robusta beans contain nearly twice the caffeine of arabica and are also more acidic. Mass-marketed brands of coffee contain primarily
robusta, whereas specialty coffees tend to be made primarily from arabica beans.

Supplying worldwide demand requires an incredible amount of space.

If predators persist in eating a caffeine-containing plant, the caffeine can cause central nervous system disruptions and even lethal
side effects. Most pests soon learn to leave the plant alone.

Evidence suggests that it may take up to *seven days* to decaffeinate the blood of habitual coffee drinkers.4 Plus, it can take three weeks
or more for the body’s levels of stress hormones to return to normal. If that’s not accumulation, what is?

It is also important to look at the chain of biochemical and behavioral events that caffeine creates, not just the immediate
effects.

### Are You Addicted?

Of all my recommendations—including weight loss, dietary change, exercise, and stress management—no single factor matched the impact of caffeine reduction.

“Caffeinism” is a state of chronic toxicity resulting from excess caffeine consumption. Caffeinism usually combines physical addiction
with a wide range of debilitating effects, most notably anxiety, irritability, mood swings, sleep disturbance, depression, and fatigue.

If your total is between 100 and 300 milligrams per day, you’re in the “danger zone.” Disruption of sleep patterns begins at this level, and
certain heart disease risk factors may be increased.

• If your total is 300 to 600 milligrams per day, you are undoubtedly experiencing some degree of mental and physical addiction to caffeine. Research shows an almost 200 percent increase of risk for ulcers and fibrocystic disease at this level.

• Intake of 600 to 900 milligrams per day indicates almost certain addiction. At this level, your mood and energy levels are severely
affected. Research suggests that your risk of heart attack may be twice that of non-caffeine users. If you are a pre-menopausal woman,
your chance of maintaining optimal iron levels is slim.

• At 900 milligrams or more per day, you’re a caffeine addict—hook, line, and sinker. At this level of dependency, all heart disease risk
factors are significantly increased, as are the risks for stroke, psychological disorders, and gastrointestinal disease. You may need medical help to kick the habit.

1\. Energy swings or periods of fatigue during the
day
2\. Mood swings or periods of depression during
the day
3\. Headaches
4\. Gastrointestinal distress; cramping, diarrhea
5\. Constipation and/or dependence on caffeine for bowel
movement
6\. Stifness in your neck, shoulders, jaw, hands, legs, or stomach
7\. Premenstrual syndrome; menstrual irregularity, cramps, sore
breasts
8\. Painful/sensitive lumps in the breast
9\. Insomnia
10\. Clenching the jaw or grinding teeth during sleep
11\. Anxiety
12\. Irritability, including inappropriate fits” of anger
13\. Involuntary movement in the leg (restless leg syndrome)
14\. Irregular or rapid heartbeat
15\. Light-headedness/dizziness
16\.Wake up feeling tired
17\. Generalized pain (back
pain, stomach pain, muscle aches)
18\. High blood pressure
19\. Ulcers
20\. Anemia
21\. Shortness of breath
22\. Difficulty concentrating and/or memory loss
23\. Ringing in the ears
24\. Coldness in the extremities, especially fingertips
25\. Hand tremor

Caffeine has been found to impair motor steadiness in neuropsychological tests.

TMJD affects millions of Americans, contributes to headache and a raft of other disorders, and is positively associated with stress and
caffeine intake.

Teeth clenching and grinding (bruxism) at night are also related to stress and caffeine.

#### WITHDRAWAL

Reducing the dose or stopping the drug altogether produces well-defined symptoms, which may include:

• Headache
• Depression
• Profound fatigue
• Irritability
• Disorientation
• Increased muscle tension
• Nausea
• Vomiting

#### DEPENDENCE

Despite knowledge of a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or
exacerbated by caffeine.

#### INABILITY TO QUIT

This was defined as a “persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control use”.

Caffeine doesn’t give you energy—*it creates tension*, and the ultimate result of tension is always fatigue.

Total health also requires emotional stability, peace of mind, and an optimistic attitude. The effects of caffeine diminish these qualities.
Relationships with friends, partners, and co-workers depend on harmony, which is destroyed by anxiety, irritability, and tension.

Caffeine not only intensifies the stress in our lives, but makes us less able to cope.

### Caffeine and Your Body

Nearly 90 percent of American adults drink caffeinated beverages. This includes the scientists who explore caffeine’s effects and the
journalists who report the scientists’ findings.

Increasing their risk for heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, PMS, panic attacks, and fibro-cystic breast disease.

The half-life of a single dose of caffeine can range from three to twelve hours.

Damage being done to your adrenals, blood vessels, breasts, brain, gastrointestinal tract, DNA, immune system, and bones.

Caffeine is rapidly absorbed by every organ and tissue in the body and diffuses into body fluids, including saliva, semen, breast milk, and
amniotic fluid. Caffeine goes everywhere and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier. Only then does the liver begin the task of reducing this troublesome toxin, and it’s not easy.

Usually, drug detoxification is a job shared by the liver and kidneys. The kidneys remove what they can and excrete it in the urine. Not so
with caffeine. The kidneys try to get rid of the molecule, but it is reabsorbed into the bloodstream before it reaches the urinary tract. Thus, the burden falls entirely on the liver.

Caffeine alone is broken down into more than twenty-five by-products or metabolites, the primary ones being paraxanthine, theobromine, and theophylline. Interestingly, each of these metabolites has its own biochemistry and effect on the body.

Caffeine and its breakdown products (collectively called methylxanthines) have a number of effects on the body.

First, they disrupt the normal function of adenosine receptors.

Adenosine dampens or slows down neuron firing. It acts like a fuse box to prevent your circuits from getting overloaded. When caffeine
inactivates this control mechanism, your neuron circuits keep firing, and you feel alert. The problem is, your circuits keep firing, and firing, and firing.…

Uncontrolled neuron firing creates an emergency situation, which triggers the pituitary gland in the brain to secrete ACTH
(adrenocorticotrophic hormone). ACTH tells the adrenal glands to pump out stress hormones—the next major side effect of caffeine. A single 250-milligram dose of caffeine (the equivalent of about *21/2* six-ounce cups of coffee) has been shown to increase levels of the
stress hormone epi-nephrine (commonly known as adrenaline) by more than 200 percent.

Caffeine also stimulates the production of norepinephrine, another stress hormone that acts directly on the brain and nervous system. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are responsible for increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and that “emergency” feeling. In fact, the emergency is quite real. 

Caffeine can trigger a classic fight-or-flight stress reaction.

There is one factor that tips the balance toward panic, and that is caffeine. It lowers the stress threshold so that events we would
normally handle suddenly become insurmountable. Not only that, you will soon see that caffeine reduces the brain’s problem-solving
ability. 

As part of the ancient survival response, stress stimulates neuron activity in the primitive part of the brain known as the limbic
system. However, the vast majority of problems we face today require reason, imagination, and creativity: all functions of the “higher
brain” or cerebrum.

The sugar and fat that are dumped into your bloodstream go unused. The sugar creates additional metabolic stress, and the fat clogs your arteries.

And since blood flow has been diverted from the gastrointestinal tract, the food you just ate is converted to a fermenting and
putrefying mass.

Caffeine is a major contributor to the bloating, pain, and gas that roughly 50 percent of American adults experience after they eat.

Unseen are the harmful by-products of fermentation and putrefaction.

Some of these by-products are absorbed back into the bloodstream, and the toxins that stay in the gut increase your risk of gastrointestinal disease.

There’s no reason to digest your breakfast if you are about to become lunch.… \[Under stress\] a whole series of maintenance and repair
activities just stop.

Another part of the stress response known as vascular resistance, in which peripheral blood vessels constrict.

This response is great if you’re fighting for your life—if you’re cut, you’ll lose less blood and your blood will clot faster. But if you’re
sitting at breakfast reading the morning paper, vascular resistance will only raise your blood pressure and significantly increase your chances of having a heart attack or stroke.

Vascular resistance affects blood vessels throughout the body, not just in your fingertips. The coldness in your hands and feet indicates
that billions of cells are suffering from reduced metabolic efficiency. That means less oxygen is getting to those cells and less carbon dioxide and other wastes are being removed. It means that fine blood vessels in the brain are constricting and cerebral blood flow is reduced. And because caffeine increases brain activity at the same time, a situation known as relative brain hypoperfusion results.

In this condition, the brain is deprived of oxygen, and the consequences, when repeated day after day, can be quite serious.

With daily caffeine use, another stress hormone known as cortisol becomes elevated.

Cortisol is that it tends to remain in the bloodstream much longer than epinephrine or norepinephrine.

People who consume more than 300 milligrams of caffeine per day may have elevated serum cortisol for eighteen out of every twenty-four hours.

Quality of their sleep is diminished, their immune system is adversely affected, age-related deterioration is accelerated, and there is a gradual but significant change in mind, mood, and behavior.

Not only is caffeine addictive, but it also encourages other addictions to substances like nicotine. The key factor in this interaction appears to be a brain chemical known as dopamine.

The center of the adrenal gland, called the medulla produces two major biochemicals: epinephrine and nor-epinephrine.

We need these hormones for more than the occasional emergency.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine are also required for any stressful activity, including sports and recreation.

Surrounding the medulla is the adrenal cortex, which produces a variety of other hormones that help regulate blood pressure, blood
sugar, mineral levels, immune activity, inflammation, and cell growth and repair. 

In all, more than 150 hormones are produced by the adrenals or metabolized from adrenal hormones.

One group, known as glucocorticoids (including corti-sol), act as a brake on the immune system. This is an essential function that
prevents overenthusiastic immune cells from attacking the body’s own healthy tissues.

Excess glucocorticoid production (caused by stress and caffeine) can profoundly suppress immunity.

There is an intriguing but not fully understood connection between stress, caffeine, and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid
arthritis, lupus, and MS. Now we know that the onset of autoimmune disease is very frequently preceded by a period of severe stress or depression, but it’s not simply that stress weakens the adrenals and leads to poor immune control.

DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) can accurately be called the vitality hormone.

The adrenals produce it in abundance during youth, helping to create the energy, optimism, sex drive, and high level of immunity we enjoy in our twenties.

DHEA is the precursor to other essential sex and youth hormones such as testosterone and estrogen.

At about age twenty-five, DHEA levels start to drop, and this decline continues until at age seventy, most people are only producing about
15 percent of prime peak. The effects of low DHEA are unfortunate and far-reaching: decreased energy, decreased immune competence, and immune dysregulation contributing to autoimmune disease. 

Low DHEA obviously contributes to decreased sex drive, as well as reduced ability to repair and rebuild tissues.

Much of the degeneration associated with aging can be avoided by maintaining high levels of DHEA. That, of course, is going to be
terribly difficult if you’re drinking a lot of coffee— since caffeine elevates cortisol, which leads to DHEA deficiency stress and caffeine create such a high need for cortisol that the exhausted adrenals simply cannot maintain production of DHEA at optimal levels.

Caffeine can lower the stress threshold (the point where stress becomes distress).

You cannot raise brain levels of GABA by eating it.

Caffeine, it turns out, disrupts the normal metabolism of GABA.

But when there’s caffeine (or its metabolites) in your bloodstream, you are unlikely to experience deep sleep at all.

Caffeine at any time of the day can cause sleep problems, especially if you are under stress.

Caffeine contributes to fatigue in at least three other ways. Adrenal exhaustion results in profound tiredness, as can blood sugar
abnormalities associated with caffeine use. And we’ve already seen in Chapter 2 that the muscle tension resulting from stress can
use up tremendous amounts of energy.

Caffeine plays a major role because it stimulates the fight-or-flight stress response described earlier. As part of this response, the liver
rapidly raises blood sugar levels.

Body must then deal with the metabolic emergency of hyperglycemia (elevated blood sugar). This is accomplished by the pancreas, which secrets insulin, driving the blood-sugar level down.

In some individuals, however, blood sugar may decrease to levels below normal, resulting in hypoglycemia and the all-too-familiar “letdown” feeling a few hours after the coffee lift.

Causes an increased loss of thiamin and other B vitamins in the urine.

Loss of calcium and other minerals.

As little as 150 milligrams of caffeine caused increased loss of calcium, magnesium, sodium, and chloride in the urine.

Zinc was added to the list of nutrients depleted by caffeine.

A single cup of coffee can reduce iron absorption from a meal by as much as 75 percent.

Low iron can seriously affect energy, immunity, and even brain function long before anemia develops.

Caffeine resulted in significantly lower levels of melatonin.

While the adrenals are busy fighting a phantom enemy, real enemies may go unchecked. The adrenals are responsible for helping mount an immune attack against a wide range of pathogens. 

Studies show that adrenal hormone production may triple during acute infection.

If stress is prolonged, adaptive mechanisms may fail, leading to serious and chronic illness.

Another gradual effect of caffeinism is that your concentration becomes one-dimensional. You tend to lose the big picture because you
can’t step back from what you’re involved in.

### Caffeine and Your Mind

Habitual and light caffeine consumers had basically the same increase in stress hormones, proving that people do not develop a tolerance to the anxiety-producing effects of caffeine. Rather, people simply become accustomed to the feelings of stress, irritability, and
aggressiveness produced by the drug.

Chronic caffeine ingestion may cause or exacerbate anxiety and may be associated with depression and increased use of anti-anxiety drugs.

Caffeine may aggravate the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.

Chronic users who are caffeine-sensitive may have symptoms of caffeinism at relatively low doses

As little as 100 milligrams of caffeine (a six-ounce serving) can cause a significant *decrease* in recall and reasoning.

Nature did not design the stress response to enable us to engage in abstract or global reasoning, such as may be required for complex
tasks or final exams. The stress response causes a shift of mental function to a very primitive survival-oriented part of the brain known as the limbic system.

Adenosine receptor antagonists (such as caffeine) have a depressive effect on other brain biochem-icals, such as acetylcholine.

Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter directly involved in memory and learning, this could account for some of the observed negative
effects.

Caffeine causes a remarkable decrease in cerebral blood flow.

Caffeine, even in small doses, is a potent cerebral vasoconstrictor.

A dose of 250 milligrams (approximately fifteen ounces of coffee) produced approximately a 30 percent decrease in whole-brain cerebral
blood flow.

At the same time, caffeine increases blood pressure in the brain, leading to an increased risk for stroke.

Caffeine reduces the oxygen level of brain tissues.

Stress and caffeine can abolish nearly all of the neurological benefits you might obtain from DHEA.

If you want the improvements in brain function that optimal levels of DHEA can provide, you’ll have to cut back on caffeine. That’s because there is a tug-of-war going on in your body between DHEA and stress hormones. When stress hormones predominate, your immune system, emotional state, energy, vitality, and DHEA levels all suffer—and aging is accelerated as a result.

*Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders* (DSM) includes an entire section on caffeinism.
>Why was it removed?

It can take three weeks or longer for stress hormones to return to normal after discontinuing caffeine.

Alcohol abusers who drink to counteract the anxiety and/or depression produced by excess caffeine intake.

When pregnant women consume caffeine, their babies are often born with a caffeine dependency.

Well-defined vicious cycle of caffeine intake: anxiety > depression > impaired sleep > increased caffeine use > anxiety > ...

As sleep improves, you would expect an increase in energy, but the ripple effect of benefits also included decreased pain, better mood, decreased reliance on prescription and over-the-counter drugs, enhanced immune function, and improvements in memory and learning.

Patients reported “feeling themselves” again. In some cases, where caffeine consumption had been lifelong, they were literally
discovering who they were for the first time.

### Specific Health Disorders: The Caffeine Connection

A modest amount of caffeine taken before exercise produced dangerous elevations in blood pressure.

Caffeine is known to disturb calcium metabolism.

Intake of less than 300 milligrams per day has been associated with greater incidence of arrhythmias.

Caffeine can also cause tachycardia (rapid heartbeat) and can exacerbate the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP), a common heart
defect.

Caffeine can cause a sudden contraction of the aortic muscle, as well as dramatically increased stress hormone release in the heart itself.

Caffeine can increase the incidence of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (PAT) and ventricular beats, other types of heart rhythm disturbance.

Moderate caffeine ingestion appears to produce no abnormal HRV in young adults, it has been shown to aggravate abnormal HRV in
overweight, middle-aged subjects.

Spasm of one or more arteries leading to the heart. Known as coronary vasospasm, this event can shut
off blood supply as effectively as a clot or atherosclerosis.

Caffeine contributes to coronary vasospasm in multiple ways. We know that caffeine, by stimulating the release of stress hormones, the stress threshold (review Chapter 3) so that situations that would otherwise have been handled become distressful. With this caffeine-induced stress “magnifier,” the risk of vasospasm is increased.

Caffeine also contributes to magnesium deficiency, a condition that makes arteries more prone to spasm.

A strong association between coffee consumption and elevated blood levels of a biochemical known as homocysteine.

Elevated homocysteine is a powerful contributor not only to heart disease, but also to stroke, miscarriage, birth defects, and possibly
Alzheimer’s disease.

The elimination of homocysteine from the blood requires optimal amounts of folic acid, vitamin B-12, and vitamin B-6.

Caffeine depletes these vital nutrients. Secondly, caffeine appears to interfere with the normal breakdown of homocysteine. A diet high in meat and dairy products, on the other hand, tends to overload the system.

When measured at rest, caffeine raises blood pressure only a little. But when you add stress (either physical or mental), caffeine can
raise blood pressure significantly.

The GI tract has five major functions

1\. Microbial Defense: 
- Caffeine Reduces Microbial Defense.
- Caffeine interferes with the secretion and immune activity of secretory IgA.
- As the stress hormone cortisol rises, slgA tends to fall.
- Caffeine consumed with food can actually decrease the normal and necessary acid response to a meal.
- This reduces both the digestive and the decontamination activity of your stomach.

2\. Digestion:
- Depending on when it is consumed in relation to food, coffee can either raise or lower production of HCL by the stomach. If acid levels rise too far or too fast, one group of problems is created, including increased risk for ulcer. 
- If HCL secretion is reduced, food will tend to ferment and putrefy, leading to the production of toxic by-products. 
- Coffee has been found to produce a chain reaction of maldigestion throughout the entire GI tract.
- Coffee may also speed gastric emptying, meaning that the contents of the stomach are passed prematurely into the small intestine, cutting short the important gastric phase of the digestive process.

3\. Essential Barrier:
- Caffeine Impairs the Barrier Mechanism of the GI Tract
- If material from the stomach is released too early, it tends to be excessively acidic, and this may injure sensitive intestinal tissue.
- Thermal or acid-related injury to this tissue is known to compromise the barrier function of the gut, leading to the absorption of materials that you really don’t want in your bloodstream.

4\.Absorption:
- vitamins and minerals that are known to be affected.
- Thaimin and other B Vitamins
- Calcium
- Magnesium
- Potassium
- Iron
- Zinc
- In animal experiments, coffee and tea were both found to decrease the bioavailability of protein

5\.Elimination:
- Caffeine Disturbs Normal Elimination
- Coffee is a frequent cause of both constipation and diarrhea
- Can also cause constipation due to its diuretic action
- Caffeine tends to pull water out of the digestive tract, leading to hard stools that are difficult to pass.
- Many coffee drinkers become dependent on this laxative action. Without the caffeine stimulation, they experience what is known as “rebound constipation.”

The undeniable coffee connection has to do with the effect that coffee (even decaf) has on the valve between the esophagus and the stomach.

Coffee reduces the pressure on this valve so that the highly acidic contents of the stomach are allowed to pass up into the esophagus.

Heartburn sufferers have been found to produce *less* stomach acid when given coffee.

Stop drinking coffee, tea, and soft drinks. Eat slowly and chew well.

Eat smaller, more frequent meals, start an exercise program and make it a regular habit, learn a stress management technique and take some time off, sign up for a yoga class and learn the breathing exercises.

Make sure to get at least eight hours of sleep a night, and slow down!

Life’s too short to suffer with internal bleeding from a perforated intestinal tract.

Individuals with chronic back pain were found to be consuming an average of nearly 400 milligrams of caffeine per day

The drug disrupts calcium ion flow through what are known as calcium-release channels. Smooth muscle lacks these caffeine-sensitive calcium-release channels, so there is no contraction. Skeletal muscle, however, is rich in calcium-release channels, and thus caffeine can cause contraction or spasm.

A procedure called the caffeine contracture test measures the degree to which a muscle contracts in response to caffeine.

A syndrome of muscle pain after exertion has also been identified in humans, and once again, the marker appears to be increased sensitivity to caffeine.

Caffeine is a common trigger for migraine and other types of headache.

Caffeine increases tension in the jaw, shoulders, back, and neck. It has a powerful vasoconstrictive effect in the brain.

A caffeine deprivation (withdrawal) headache results from the normal opening (dilation) of blood vessels that are constricted by caffeine.

One of the primary markers of aging, of course, is dehydration, and the loss of water from our tissues is accelerated by caffeine.

Caffeine is a known mutagen. That is, it can cause replication error, either by damaging the DNA blue print or disrupting communication of
that information to other “builder” molecules like RNA.

Caffeine has been shown to inhibit DNA repairs.

Caffeine magnifies the DNA-damaging effects of other mutagens.

Caffeine may very well potentiate free-radical damage in a number of ways:

1\.Caffeine directly reduces tissue levels of melatonin, an antioxidant critical to the protection of DNA.
2\. In animal experiments, caffeine magnifies the free-radical damage produced by radiation exposure.
3\. Caffeine raises stress hormone levels, which are known to accelerate free-radical damage.

Caffeine = Stress, and that dearly leads to degeneration and aging, not vitality and youthfulness.

*Caffeine raises blood sugar levels* and disrupts the blood sugar-regulating effect of insulin.

Has been shown to produce transient insulin resistance that is very similar to Type II diabetes.

*Caffeine raises fatty acid levels* in the blood.

*Caffeine raises homocysteine levels*

*Caffeine causes vascular resistance*

Peripheral circulation is already impaired in diabetes, and the added effect of caffeine can prove disastrous.

*Caffeine raises stress hormone levels*,

Chronic stress, including feelings of irritability and hostility, has been linked to the development of insulin resistance, leading to the
diabetic state.

Hypoglycemic state can be induced and/or exacerbated by caffeine.

Imagine if you had to live in a constant state of “emergency alert.” It would be exhausting. In the same way, the adrenal glands, designed
for episodes of stress (emergencies) in which tremendous energy is needed to fight or run away, find themselves in a situation where
heightened activity is required *all the time.* And it’s not just job stress. 

It’s metabolic stress from poor food choices, pollution, and electromagnetic radiation. It’s the pace of twentieth-century living
and the breakdown of family (tribal) support groups and community. 

And on top of that, most people add caffeine, a drug that elevates stress hormones and can keep them elevated eighteen hours a day. For the poor adrenals, there’s just no rest.

Adrenal weakness or adrenal insufficiency

After a certain point, your adrenals are so exhausted that the pendulum swings the other way. And that’s when you become most vulnerable to a whole new group of problems associated with adrenal exhaustion: namely, disorders related to inflammation and
autoimmunity, among them allergy, asthma (inflammation of the bronchial airways), and even rheumatoid arthritis.

Mood disorder and the inflammation may both be related to adrenal insufficiency.

DHEA appears actually to help restore adrenal function.

### Caffeine and Women's Health

Women detoxify coffee much more slowly than men. What’s more, the half-life of caffeine (the time it takes the body to eliminate one-half of a given dose) changes according to a woman’s menstrual cycle.

Iron deficiency, inadequate calcium intake, osteoporosis, and depression are devastating problems for women.

Caffeine dramatically reduces iron absorption.

Caffeine increases calcium loss and risk of osteoporosis.

Caffeine produces short-term mood elevation, but contributes to rebound depression.

Postmenopausal women?

 A significant association between caffeine consumption and reduced bone mass.

Documented cases have appeared in the medical literature showing that anemia was *incurable* until the patient stopped consuming caffeine.

Woman will typically be iron deficient for *two to three years* before she becomes anemic.

Simple and inexpensive blood test that measures body stores of iron, called serum ferritin.

Serum iron is a meaningless test. It only tells you how much iron is traveling through your blood.

Serum ferritin is also the only iron indicator that is able to differentiate between true iron deficiency and anemia due to
infection.

Most symptoms are related to energy and mental alertness, so the connection with caffeine is more than casual.

A woman with low iron stores is likely to have low energy and a hard time concentrating. Chances are she will also be depressed.

**Ferritin Level**: **Iron Status**
0–10 Severe iron deficiency
10–18 Marginal iron deficiency
18–40 Adequate
40–100 Optimal iron nutriture

Most bioavailable form of iron I have found is a chelated iron, known as iron glycinate.

If your ferritin is between 18 and 40, premenopausal women should still consider iron glycinate at 30 milligrams per day.

Vitamin C has been shown to enhance iron absorption. If your supplement does not already contain vitamin C, take a 200-milligram
tablet of vitamin C with your iron.

Avoid other iron robbers: sugar, high doses of calcium supplements (especially calcium carbonate), phytic acid (wheat bran), and oxalic
acid (spinach, beet tops).

Even marginal iron deficiency—what I call iron insufficiency—can contribute to mood, memory, and learning disorders long before anemia
ever develops.

The more caffeine you ingest, the worse your PMS will be.

Episodes of depression during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle have been linked with elevated cortisol and caffeine consumption

Caffeine is associated with decreases in levels of estradiol.

Caffeine ingestion also tends to lower blood levels of bioavailable testosterone in women, and raises levels of sex hormone binding
globulin.

Eliminating caffeine can help reduce both the number of hot flashes and their intensity.

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in their breast tissue. Since caffeine is known to increase cAMP.

Caffeine has been shown conclusively to cause fetal growth retardation.

Issue of unseen defects that would elude detection but still affect the baby’s health, such as decreased thymic weight (affecting
immunity) and degeneration of the lens of the eye.

### Politics and Pushers

The caffeine industry funds “public service” programs and prints brochures ostensibly to “educate” the public about caffeine.

People tend to crave fat when their stress hormone levels are elevated.

Commercially grown coffee is the most heavily sprayed food or beverage crop in the world (overall third, behind cotton and tobacco), and the chemicals that are liberally used include some of the most dangerous herbicides, pesticides, and fungicides.

In fact, many of the chemicals sprayed on coffee plants are banned in the United States, and there is evidence that these chemicals are present at high levels on coffee beans.

Brazilian coffee beans (the most common type sold in the United States) were found to contain residues of DDT, BHC, lindane, aldrin, and chlordane, all known carcinogens.

The countries with the greatest loss of rain forest were those with the highest production of coffee.

But in the late 1980s some of the large coffee growers started shifting to a new hybrid coffee that grows in full sun. Without competition from other trees and plants, these plantations were planted more densely. Yields from sun coffee plantations were three to four times higher than traditional shade coffee farms, resulting in greatly increased profits. 

Faced with competition from sun plantations, more and more growers started clear-cutting rain forest to increase their yields. This increased production coincided with two years of bumper crop production worldwide—and suddenly, in the early 1990s, there was a glut of coffee on the world market.

Remove the pulp of the coffee cherry from the bean and dry the green bean. The process takes large amounts of water over several washing steps.

But what happens to coffee pulp and the processing water? This water, now laden with pesticides, fungicides, and nitrogenous waste, goes directly into local streams, rivers, and lakes.

### Options and Alternatives

The acidity of coffee is higher in decaf because robusta beans are commonly used to produce decaf coffee.

### Off the Bean and on to Vitality

Other symptoms of caffeine withdrawal, like rebound constipation, are related to decreased muscular stress. With caffeine no longer contracting your intestinal muscles, you may experience sluggish elimination. It may take several months to restore the natural rhythm and function of your colon.

Fatigue, depression, and “brain fog” resulting from caffeine withdrawal.

Adjustment period is often perceived as a “letdown.

The human body is designed to last about 120 years, and that it is quite capable of sustaining a high level of energy until the very end.

When you exercise regularly, you are placing a demand on your body, and your body will respond by creating energy.

When the brain learns the muscles will be requiring more energy on a daily basis, it kicks into gear a whole cascade of metabolic reactions that make that energy available.

### Conclusion

Scores of people have told me over the years that the most significant change they noticed when they got off caffeine was in their personality, how they related to their family, friends, and colleagues. This is the very essence of who we are as individuals and
how we act together as a society.

### Notes

Although chocolate does not contain a great deal of caffeine, it contains high amounts of a related compound known as theobromine. If you add the stimulant effects of both caffeine and theobromine, chocolate has the stimulating power of forty milligrams of caffeine per one-ounce piece.

I finished my interview at 9:50am. The officer asked me if I'd elect for the oath ceremony on the same day. Of course, yes. She did tell me it was not offered every day. The system placed me for the 12pm wave. But when I went downstairs to the desk, the lady in charge was able to switch me into the 10am wave. Was done and became US citizen before 10:30am.

**SF FO logistics:**

My appointment was at 8:55am. I arrived around 8:25am and saw a spacious street parking spot one block away. While paying, the machine automatically had time allocated until 11am. Not sure if I could have extended it if I wanted to, but I was told same day ceremony is no longer offered, so 11am should be enough for my interview. $12.5. While walking over, I did see a parking garage. I think $8/hour?

I was desparate for coffee after the morning drive, so I walked to the Starbucks 1.5 blocks away to get coffee. But of course, I had to drink it before entering the building.

The citizenship appointments enter on Washington street. Almost no line. There's a long line on Sansome St (maybe for immigration court?). For my line (3 people), I learned that they come out periodically to let people in, so I waited for \~10 minutes while finishing my coffee. By the time I entered the building, it was past 8:55am. No big deal, as I found that you are put in the system (to be called) after you check in, so it's not too crucial if you are early, on time, or even a little late. The guy next to me entered one hour ahead of his appointment time.

I was able to bring my phone and laptop in. Browsed my phone the entire time while waiting. No issue with that.

**Interview Experience:**

I waited for around 20 minutes before my name was called. The lady's greeting was not exactly warm then. But once the interview started, she seemed totally fine. The standard process: 1) A question is shown on the pad, and she reads the answer for me to write using the stylus pen on the pad. 2) 6 random questions from Civic Test. Nailed it of course. 3) I obtained my GC through work 17 years ago, so there's nothing that'd reject my case. Much time was spent on chit chatting. She seems genuinely curious about my private life. 4) Then she went over a few standard questions that were in my N400 application (e.g. was I ever in a gang, etc?).
