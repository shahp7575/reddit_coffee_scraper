**The Inner Sanctum: How the Exchange Club Provides Political Cover for a Troubled School District**

In the intricate and often opaque ecosystem of small-town governance, power is rarely exercised solely in public meetings. It is cultivated in backrooms, at coffee shops, and perhaps most effectively, within the respected confines of local service clubs. In Porterville, the Exchange Club is not merely a group of community-minded volunteers; it has become an essential, unofficial arm of the Porterville Unified School District’s (PUSD) public relations machine, providing a shield for Superintendent Nate Nelson and the Board of Trustees against a rising tide of scrutiny.

This dynamic is not accidental. It is engineered through a deliberate overlap of personnel, creating a closed loop where criticism is neutralized and narratives are controlled before they ever reach the broader public. The presence of not one, but two sitting PUSD Board Members—**Pete Lara Jr.** (a Past President) and **Felipe Martinez**—within the leadership of the Exchange Club transforms the club from a neutral civic organization into a de facto safe space for the district’s power brokers.

**The Illusion of Independent Endorsement**

When Superintendent Nelson stood before the Porterville Rotary Club, as reported by the Recorder, he was performing a classic political tactic: speaking to a “friendly” audience. The Exchange Club connection takes this several steps further. It provides a platform where the administration’s messaging can be endorsed by what appears to be an independent third party—the Club—when in reality, the endorsers are the very officials responsible for overseeing the administration.

Imagine a concerned parent who hears from a member of the respected Exchange Club that the district’s new drug testing policy is “well-received.” What they don’t see is that the member relaying this talking point may be a school board trustee who voted for the policy. This creates an echo chamber where the district’s initiatives are validated by a seemingly neutral community entity, blurring the lines between official policy and staged support. The Club’s mantle of “community service” is leveraged to launder the reputation of the district.

**Preempting and Neutralizing Criticism**

The true function of this relationship is damage control. The recent Porterville Recorder article, published the day before a potentially explosive PUSD board meeting, is a textbook example. The article, focusing on safety and drug testing, was a strategic distraction from the serious financial and ethical violations detailed in the 802-page meeting packet.

The Exchange Club network is the groundwork that makes this kind of deflection possible. It is a venue where:

1. **Narratives are Pre-Vetted:** Discussions between Nelson, Lara, and Martinez can happen informally within the Club long before they reach a public agenda. Potential controversies can be identified and strategies for managing public perception can be devised away from the public record.
2. **Dissent is Muted:** It is far more difficult for a fellow Club member to offer sharp, public criticism of a superintendent or a board colleague they break bread with weekly. The social pressure of the group fosters consensus and discourages the kind of rigorous, adversarial oversight that effective governance requires.
3. **The Choir is Preached To:** The Club’s membership, which likely includes other influential business owners and community figures, becomes a captured audience. By securing the buy-in of this group, the administration insulates itself from criticism from a segment of the community that might otherwise be vocal about fiscal mismanagement and legal non-compliance.

**The Ethical Quagmire of Dual Roles**

The presence of Board Members Lara and Martinez in the Club creates a perpetual, low-grade conflict of interest. Their primary duty as elected officials is to provide independent, vigilant oversight of the Superintendent they hired. Yet, within the context of the Club, they are his peers and fellow members, creating a competing loyalty.

This dual role makes it incredibly difficult for them to fulfill their fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers. Can they truly hold Nelson accountable for the district’s failure to meet the state’s 55% classroom spending requirement when they share a membership roster with him? Can they objectively scrutinize a multi-million dollar interfund transfer when they are invested in maintaining a unified, positive front for their shared community network?

The answer, evidenced by the district’s current trajectory, appears to be no. Their membership creates an inherent bias towards protecting the institution’s image rather than exposing its flaws for necessary repair.

**Conclusion: Governance by Networking, Not by Oversight**

The Porterville Exchange Club, in this context, is not a service club that happens to have school board members. It is a political network that provides critical insulation for a failing administration. The dual membership of Lara and Martinez negates the possibility of true independent oversight and creates a seamless pipeline for district propaganda to be filtered into the community as grassroots sentiment.

The public is left with a carefully constructed illusion of competence and community support, orchestrated within the private meetings of a club that has traded its mission of community welfare for the role of political bodyguard. The real story of PUSD is not found in the sanitized speeches given to the Rotary Club, but in the negative fund balances, the failed state compliance reports, and the millions of dollars moved without transparency. And it is precisely that story which the networks of the Exchange Club are designed to keep hidden.",1,1757607037.0,PortervilleFraud,0,1.0,False

‍

**Why This Pick?**

I saw both Vasquez and McBrown listed and immediately thought this game total could land on the moon, friends. Not only has the Over cashed in 4 of the last 5 meetings between these two, but McCade Brown comes into this encounter with a whopping 12.54 ERA and no wins to his name. Comically, this same pitching matchup occurred last week in Colorado and saw a collective 18-run total. I know we’re not at hitter-friendly Coors Field this evening, but I do think these two squads bag at least half that. To be frank, the Padres just have too big an edge for this game not to see a big total, and I don’t trust Vasquez to keep the Rockies off the board. I’m on the Over to hit.

Dr came in and said the urine was negative but they drew blood and are sending to the lab. It's Thursday 9/11 today, last period started a month ago on 8/11 and my cycles are 25-27 days, and on Saturday morning 9/5 I got darker lines (the photo of 5 fmu) than the one I just took after the doctor's office from cvs, frer. I took the early test and the digital frer just now and the digital said no and the early response frer showed a faint line in the right timeframe (haven't drank anything since about 9 to 9:30 and it was only 10:45 and this is the single test and line reader inversion). Kind of freaking out I could have caught a chemical pregnancy because my period is never ever more than a day late and it was due last Saturday or Sunday to Monday at the latest as I have been tracking my cycle and LH surges for a year now. Still no spotting but my cream CM did increase today which is odd. I don't want to overthink this but I was so excited and feel let down by the negativity in my mind now.

1nect5p,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Own_Regular_424/comments/1nect5p/episode_2_not_you/,Episode 2: Not You.,"**INTRO — The Apartment Too Perfect**

What if one morning… you woke up in your own apartment.

But everything — the coffee cup tilted exactly three degrees, the fold in the bedsheet — was flawless.

Too flawless… to belong in reality.

Would you believe it was real?

Or worse — that someone had already done countless things here… things you once tried to forget.

**CHAPTER 1 — The Room That Waited**

I always believed I lived alone.

Until I began to notice… breakfast sometimes disappeared — though I couldn’t remember ever eating it.

Maybe I forgot. Maybe I sleepwalked.  
Or maybe… it was just my roommate.

It sounded reasonable.  
Except… I’d never actually seen him.

We had an arrangement. Different schedules. No knocking. No questions. No contact.

Only a few messages. No emojis. No typos. Not a single extra mark.  
A strange agreement. But it worked.

Too well.

So well it no longer felt like two people sharing a space.  
It felt like one person… living with a rough draft of themselves.

The longer I stayed, the more I felt — I hadn’t moved into this apartment.  
I’d been fitted into a gap already carved out. Tailored to my height. My breathing.

And the memories I was about to carry.

The apartment sat at the end of the third-floor hallway.  
Not big. Not small.

Complete in every way.  
But missing one thing: any trace of a life.

The air was frozen — caught mid-motion.  
No scent of clothes. No stale food.

Only sterile stillness. Like a waiting room no one had ever entered.

The couch — unmarked.  
The pillows — untouched.  
The kitchen — without a stain.

No background noise.  
No echo.

As if the space was preserving itself for someone who wasn’t me.  
Or worse — for someone who had been here… and was erased.

A fresh coat of paint over a memory that never had the chance to form.

I looked around. No photos. No notes.  
Not a single scratch on the floor.

Only perfection… to a degree that broke logic.

As if this place was reconstructed from the memory of someone who had never truly lived here — only imagined it.

The clock on the wall was frozen.  
3:04.

I tried to wind it. It didn’t respond.  
No one cared to fix it.

As if that moment had been chosen.  
And no one had permission to change it.

Or worse — that wasn’t when everything stopped.  
It was when everything began.

I stepped into the bathroom.  
A towel covered the mirror.

I pulled it away. Just a mirror. Clean. Smooth. Spotless.

But I felt something had stirred behind the glass.  
The back of my neck tightened.

Not from cold. But because I felt… I was being watched.  
Not by light. But by a thought I hadn’t yet had.

I never linger on mirrors. Not because I’m afraid.  
But because there’s something in the reflection that unsettles me.

As if the light in there doesn’t reflect quite right.  
A gaze slightly out of sync.

From the other side.

No sign of anyone ever living here.  
But a mirror once covered.

As if someone had been here… and tried to erase their presence from the world.

And I began to wonder:  
If someone had already been erased from this place —

What guarantee is there… that I won’t be next?

**CHAPTER 2 — The Steps That Repeat**

I couldn’t tell if I was imagining too much… or just missing the changes happening right in front of me.

At first — only little things.  
The slippers I left apart, lined up side by side the next morning.  
The toothbrush that had fallen, back in place.

Not turned. Not tilted. Not off by a single degree.

So I started testing.  
Turned a chair. Flipped a carton of milk upside down. Pushed a pen off the table.

By morning… everything was reset.  
Not half a centimeter off. Neat. Precise.

But with no randomness at all.  
As if life itself had been pressed flat — replaced with a reconstruction too perfect to breathe.

At first, I thought — my roommate.  
An obsessive neat freak.

It made sense… until I measured.  
The chair — still tilted. The pen — same exact angle.

Not a scratch. Not a shift.

As if something unseen was quietly rebuilding the world around me.  
Not from what I did… but from what it remembered of me.

And if it wasn’t me…  
then who was controlling the rest of this reality?

One night, I realized… I wasn’t choosing anymore.

I woke up — exactly 3:04 a.m.  
Not from a sound. Not from light.  
My eyes just opened.

On schedule.  
Like it had been written in.

And then… I heard it.

Footsteps. Slow. Steady.  
Moving through the hallway like a metronome hammering into my skull.

Each beat like a knock inside my ribs.  
Not outside. But from within my chest.

Each step… probing for whatever life was left.

I froze. Held my breath.  
It felt like if I moved, the sound would change.

And I didn’t want to know what it would change into.

The second time, I used my phone to record.  
The footsteps returned. Same hour. Same rhythm. Same echo.

I slowed it down. Played both tracks together.  
Every step — matched. To the millisecond.

No drift. No variance a living body could ever repeat.

I opened the door.  
The hallway was empty.

But the sound kept going.  
Step after step. Still echoing.

And then I understood.  
No one was walking.

Only a sequence… replaying itself.

Another night, just before it began, the wall clock flickered.  
Like a blackout… but the lights stayed on.

The fan kept spinning. Every other device normal.  
Then… the footsteps returned.

I didn’t move.  
It felt like if I even twitched, everything would snap out of place.

Or worse — I’d break something meant to repeat in perfect precision.

That was the first time I had a terrifying thought.

Maybe… I wasn’t the one living here.  
Maybe I was only allowed… to listen.

Not the protagonist. Just a spectator.

Pre-installed. Sitting still.  
Listening to the sounds of a life already built — from start to finish.

The only difference was… it wasn’t mine.

**CHAPTER 3 — The Dream That Writes Over**

Since the first night I heard footsteps, I began to dream.  
Every night. Always the same.

I sit across from someone. No face. No gender.  
Their voice muffled, like through a crushed speaker.

Around me — only white light.  
No lamp. No shadow.

As if I were being rendered in a world not yet complete.

I look at my hands. Too sharp. Every detail. Each breath.  
Complete… too precise to be chance.

Everything else blurred.  
Like a glitch still waiting to load.

As if I’m the only object finished, while the world waits for its update.

Every time I try to ask: *“Who are you?”*  
I wake.

Not like waking from sleep.  
But yanked out… from a layer of consciousness I never fully saw.

I shoot up. Shirt soaked. Cold, like dragged from a bottomless tank.  
My fingers twitch. My throat dry.

I don’t swallow. Afraid my voice will echo back… distorted.

I glance at the clock.  
3:04 a.m. Always.

One night, I woke with words in my head:  
*“Overwriting… overwriting…”*

Looping. Like an error message.

As if something was writing over my dream — while I was still asleep.

I turned on the light. Sat up.  
Paper. Pen.

I tried to write my name.  
The letters came out wrong.

My hand shook — like the joints had been reassembled not quite right.

I wasn’t writing. I was replaying a motion.  
Like another hand had written it before.

And I was only relearning the move.

So I started testing.  
An orange strip taped under a bowl.  
A faint X on the milk cap.  
Slippers tilted apart.

If I didn’t leave marks… I feared I wouldn’t be myself when I woke.

Morning came. Tape — in the sink. X — gone. Slippers — aligned.

Too exact for any hand to reset.  
Unless it already knew what it was correcting.

I began doubting my memory.  
Maybe I sleepwalked. Maybe I did it all. Then forgot.

But if so… who was controlling me then?

I rang the nearest apartment. No reply.  
No light. No sound.

The building felt empty.  
Except for one unit. Mine.

I stared at my hands. They felt rebuilt.  
From someone else’s memory.

Not painful. Not cold.  
But not… fully mine.

I checked the kitchen camera.  
No motion. No data. No glitch.

Just white.  
As if that moment never existed.

Or was never rendered.  
As if reality only activates… when I open my eyes.

I whispered, almost without breath:  
“I’m not sure anymore… if I’m remembering… or being remembered.”

And worse — I’m not sure I ever woke up.  
Maybe I was only assigned the sensation of waking.

Like a line of code marking the end of a cycle.

**CHAPTER 4 — The Reflection That Waits**

I hid a small camera behind the bookshelf.  
Pointed straight at the hallway.

Battery full. Memory clear. Indicator steady… as if it was waiting.

I checked it every night.  
And every night — the video froze.

At exactly 3:04.  
No error. No disconnect.

No sound. No image.  
Only white.

As if that time wasn’t mine.  
Or worse — time went on, but I was no longer allowed in.

I added more cameras.  
Different angles.

All of them recorded… until 3:04.  
No fade. No cut. Just pause.

Not a glitch.  
As if everything had been told to hold its breath.

I sealed the bathroom curtain.  
Pins. Heavy tape. Two layers, crossed.

By morning — perfect.  
No crease. No tear.

No sign I had ever touched it.  
As if every act of mine had been undone.

Reversed so cleanly it left nothing.

One night I stood before the mirror.  
The reflection didn’t come right away.

It lagged. Like it was waiting.  
For a command.

I raised my hand. Slowly. Too slowly.  
Like someone waking from anesthesia — testing what body they still belonged to.

But the reflection delayed. Watching. Waiting.  
As if asking me: *“What do you want me to do?”*

I touched my cheek.  
It followed.

But always one frame behind.  
Not light. Not physics.

Something else… copying.  
Not by glass. But by a presence stitched from memory.

I looked into its eyes.  
They looked back.

Not mine. Not sharp. Not vague.  
Just empty.

Like a template searching for a missing piece.

I stepped back. It stepped back.  
Perfect sync. Precise.

But never real. Always with a delay.  
Small… but enough to make me feel watched.

From the other side.

I whispered:  
“If I’ve never seen my roommate’s face… then how do I know someone’s really here?”

No answer. Only a faint hum from the camera in the shelf.

I said my name.  
The echo returned — but only the first syllables.

The rest twisted.  
Like tape rewinding through broken code.

And I realized.  
Something was still watching.

Not to record. But to check.  
Not to preserve. But to rebuild.

Closer. Sharper.

I sat down. Spoke slowly. As if dictating to myself:  
“If every motion I make can be relearned from a sample… then am I the original?”

“Or only a model… refined each time it breaks itself?”

I looked at my hand. Flexed. Released.  
Watched the micro-movements.

Like a system running a test. On me.

And if I am only a copy?  
If all of this is just replication?

Then what part of me cannot be cloned?  
Or am I only kept alive… as a corrupted sample, still worth extracting… until nothing remains?

**CHAPTER 5 — The Face Without a Face**

I made a plan.  
Not to find him… but to test if there was another me, besides me.

A chair braced against the forbidden door.  
A thread taped to the knob.

A recorder hidden behind the microwave.  
An infrared camera pointed at the hallway.

I checked everything. Battery. Memory. Time.  
No margin left.

That night I tried to sleep.  
My heart frantic, as if my body already knew.

I shut my eyes, opened them again.  
Repeat. Repeat.

Like a corrupted loop stuck on restart.

3:04 a.m.  
I woke.

Not to sound. Not to light.  
But to an emptiness sliding cold across my chest.

Morning came.  
The chair — still there. Thread — unbroken.

Camera alive. Recorder running.  
I almost exhaled.

As if logic could still hold me together… as long as the system obeyed.

I played the audio.  
Three minutes of silence.

No fan. No breath.  
Just absence.

As if sound itself had been erased.

I scrubbed the video — to 3:03:59.  
A flicker. One frame.

A shadow. Then… a gray smear sliding across the hall.

No face. No feet. No shadow cast.  
Just a smear.

As if what I saw was never finished.

I checked the door cam.  
Light — dead. Battery — gone.

Keys still in my pocket.  
No one could enter.

Unless… it didn’t need a door.

I looked up.  
The clock frozen.

3:04. Cold.  
As if everything moved forward… except me.

I opened older files. Frame by frame.  
Back two nights.

And there — I saw myself.

I stepped out.  
From the forbidden door.

Not rushing. Not startled.  
Slow.

Like a man repeating a dream already lived, already lost.

I froze. Hands numb.  
Not from cold — but like every nerve had been unplugged.

It couldn’t be wrong. Every twitch. Every habit.  
Mine.

But that version of me… moved like he belonged here long before I did.  
And I was only just permitted… to exist.

I turned the light on. Opened the closet.  
A green hoodie — centered.

Freshly washed.  
The scent of detergent… I never used.

I turned back to the screen.  
He was closer now. Approaching the camera.

His face — blank white.  
No lines. No depth.

A face… without a face.  
Not erased. Not hidden.

Just never granted permission to appear.  
Like a placeholder waiting for someone to assign it a name.

I stepped back. Fingers clutched the bedframe.  
Afraid I’d slide out of myself.

That I was only a thin layer — ready to be peeled off… for something else to wear.

I tried to cling to logic.  
“Maybe I forgot. Maybe I sleepwalked. Maybe… I’m still me.”

But deep in my chest — I knew.  
A part of me had already been replaced.

And if I couldn’t remember when it happened…  
Then what meaning was left… in the parts that remain?  
  
**CHAPTER 6 — The Blank Reflection**

I don’t know if it was insomnia…  
or if the light that day was wrong.

But for the first time — I saw him.

I stepped out of the bathroom.  
The mirror fogged.

I wiped a corner.  
And saw him.

A figure right behind me.  
Tall. Thin.

Wearing the same gray hoodie I once wore.  
Hair falling across half his face.

Still. Unblinking.

I turned. The room was empty.  
Only steam hanging in the air.

I faced the mirror again.  
He was still there.

Unmoving. Just behind me.

I looked into his eyes.  
But he didn’t look at me.

He looked through me.  
Into a point that wasn’t there.

I spun around. Heart pounding.  
The mirror still held him.

Sharp. Exact.  
As if his presence only existed inside the reflection.

And that reflection… no longer needed me  
to keep existing.

I stepped back. One step. Another.  
Each step I retreated — he advanced.

Closer… to the version of me I had already lost.

He didn’t need to break.  
Didn’t need to fight.

He only needed… to learn.

Then I saw it.  
He had no face.

Not hidden. Not erased.  
Just a pale white surface — smooth, uncarved.

Not unfinished. Not complete.  
Just waiting.

Like a frozen screen… never updated.

I raised my hand. The reflection followed.  
Late. A frame behind.

For the first time I knew.  
This wasn’t a reflection.

It was a being.  
Learning. Becoming.

Me.

I bowed my head. He copied.  
But wrong. Twisted. Off-beat.

Like an old tape badly replayed.

I leaned closer.  
On that blank surface… faint lines appeared.

Fragments of memory etching themselves  
into a face that didn’t yet exist.

I killed the light.  
Darkness swallowed everything.

Turned it back on.  
The mirror — empty.

Only me.  
And this time… the reflection was just a reflection.

But from that night on… every time I looked into a mirror —  
I didn’t see myself.

I saw someone rehearsing my role.

And I wondered:  
He is learning to be me.

But if he succeeds — will any part of me remain?

Or am I only a draft, temporary,  
so he can complete himself?

And when he does…  
I’ll be nothing more than a page erased too many times.

No trace left.  
No proof I was ever the original.

**CHAPTER 7 — The Recording That Came First**

I stayed awake.  
All night.

Scrubbing through the hidden camera feeds.  
Frame by frame.

Not a single moment skipped.  
I was searching — for myself.

Every twitch. Every pause. Every delay.

As if, if I caught even one slip…  
I’d see something I wasn’t ready to face.

And then I saw it.  
A clip.

Me — walking out of the forbidden door.  
No hesitation. No doubt.

Exactly like the footage I’d seen before…  
except this time — it hadn’t happened yet.

I froze on the timestamp.  
The date… still in the future.

The recording was from the future.  
But whose?

Mine… or the one I was becoming?

Cold spread through me.  
Not the room.

The video itself… recognized me.

The person in the frame — undeniably me.  
Messy hair.

The tilt of my walk, still bent from an old injury.  
Phone in the left hand — a habit too precise to fake.

I bolted upright. Rushed to the closet.  
The shirt in the video — there.

Freshly washed. No dust. No crease.  
As if it had been placed there just this morning.

I turned back to the screen.  
Reached out. Touched the clip.

The screen went dark.

I rebooted.  
The file — gone.

Not in the folder. Not in cache. Not in trash.  
No trace it had ever existed.

Except in memory.  
And even then… I wasn’t sure the memory was mine.

Panic. I began writing.  
Notes. Timelines.

Every camera numbered.  
But the more I arranged… the more it circled back.

Looping. Repeating.

Every thread of suspicion ended at the same image.  
Me. Looking into the camera.

Not absent. Not unaware.  
But watching myself.

And the thought grew:  
I wasn’t the one reviewing the footage anymore.

The footage… was choosing when to review me.

I closed my eyes. Darkness.  
And there — the video returned.

Flickering. Distorted.  
Like it was being replayed from corrupted code.

And I began to understand.

Maybe I was the anomaly.  
Maybe the recording wasn’t for me to discover.

Maybe it was only… checking  
if I was ready to be erased.

**CHAPTER 8 — The Space Between Versions**

I couldn’t wait any longer.  
If something was tampering with my memory… then every second I hesitated only made my true self fade further.

I had to see.  
Now.

I walked to the forbidden door.  
Placed my hand on the knob.

It wasn’t locked. Never had been.  
I just never dared to open it.

Until today.

The door slid sideways.  
No sound. No touch.

Like a scene skipped in a video.

Inside — no walls.  
No ceiling. No light.

Yet I could see.  
A gray space. Shallow. Hollow.

No depth. No anchor.  
As if I were standing inside the buffer of a system still waiting to render.

I stepped in.  
Gravity — gone.

Heartbeat — gone.  
Sound — gone.

I screamed. But nothing came out.  
Only the thought, trapped inside my skull.

On a flat plane… an apple.  
I picked it up. Bit down.

No taste. No juice. No crunch.  
Only emptiness sliding down my throat.

I set it back. Took a few steps. Turned around.

The bite mark was gone.  
The skin — blackened.

Not rot. Not decay.  
Edited. The data not saved.

I walked deeper. And saw him.  
Sitting. Back turned.

Wearing my clothes.  
My hair. My posture.

The scar on my neck.

I couldn’t breathe.

I had never seen myself from that angle.  
But I knew his thought.

The way his fingers curled — exactly like mine when I feel watched.

I reached out. Almost touched his shoulder.

The instant I did — he vanished.  
No sound. No fade.

Just… removed.

The space around me started to melt.  
Layers peeled away.

Textures dissolving.  
Like corrupted render.

Like code erasing itself.

I looked up. He was back.

Not sitting. Standing.  
At the edge of the space.

Not moving. Not closer.  
Just… waiting.

Like a placeholder, paused for activation.

And I realized.  
I wasn’t the main character in the next version.

I stepped back.  
He didn’t move.

Didn’t vanish. Didn’t change.  
Just stood there — as if he’d never left.

And I wondered.  
How many before me stepped into this place… and never returned in the same form?

And if the system was ready to finalize its next build…

Maybe I’ll be nothing but a blur.  
A faulty pixel.

Too faint to keep.  
Not erased. Not saved.

Just… never rendered again.

**CHAPTER 9 — The Mirror That Chooses**

I returned to the room.  
This time — no hesitation.

No fear. No doubt.

The door slid open.  
No sound. No weight.

Just a temporary pathway… barely permitted, just enough to let me return.

Inside — empty.  
No light. No figure.

No chair. Nothing… but me.

I stepped in deeper.  
A faint click beneath my foot.

I looked down.  
A shard of mirror.

Freshly cracked.  
Or maybe placed there — for me.

I picked it up.  
And saw… myself.

But not fully.  
The eyes staring back weren’t mine.

No fear. No haze.  
Only waiting.

I raised my right hand.  
It raised its left.

Reversed. Misaligned.

I smiled.  
It didn’t.

It only stared — as if retrieving a broken memory…  
and I was the last fragment of data it needed to rebuild itself.

I set the shard down. Turned around.  
Behind me — a full mirror spread across the blank wall.

I was certain it hadn’t been there before.  
Or maybe it had never been meant for me… until now.

I stepped closer. Slow. Steady.  
But the reflection didn’t move.

Didn’t follow. Didn’t mimic.  
It just stood — waiting for a signal.

I raised my hand. Touched the glass.

It was warm.  
Not cold, like any mirror should be.

And then… it began to read me.

Not invading. Not stealing.  
Just scanning.

Layer by layer.  
Every reflex.

The rhythm of my blinks.  
The swallow I make when fear swells.

I was no longer a person.  
I was data.

I tried to recall my name.  
But each syllable felt like a deleted file.

As if I lived among versions that were never saved.

I stepped back. The reflection stepped too.  
Same posture. Same timing.

Until it stopped. Frozen.

It stared. Its lips moved.  
Slow. Silent.

Two words:

**Not you.**

A click. The sound of deletion.  
No anger. No grief.

Just confirmation.  
That I wasn’t in the version kept.

I stayed still.  
No more touches. No more steps back.

I looked at the reflection and whispered — unsure if to it, or to myself:

“Maybe I lived here.  
But I was never truly me.”

“Or worse — I was him… and only just woke up.  
A memory, no longer mine, but still using me to remember itself.”

The reflection didn’t fade.  
Didn’t move. Didn’t answer.

It just existed — like an unopened file.

A fragment of data, rebuilding itself.  
Using me as the recovery tool.

And if I am not me —  
then who is remembering me?

If he is the one holding memory…  
then who do I exist for?

Or am I only the final draft of a thought… never written down?  
  
**FINAL — Unsaved File**

I don’t know if I’m still here.  
Or… still here, but already replaced by a version that fits better.

One of us has been overwritten.

But the real horror isn’t which one survived.  
It’s that there’s nothing left to confirm it.

No witness.  
No system.  
No original baseline.

Only… a recovery loop, reconstructing itself.  
Using every broken version to rebuild what it once called “me.”

I might be a copy.  
He might be a memory.  
Or both — fragments echoing a self already erased.

A story. A voice. An identity.  
Something that once carried my name… but lost its code.

And then I understood.  
In a system with no line between original and copy…  
between memory and the one who remembers…  
between reality and an endless re-render…

The word *replacement* means nothing.

Because no one is replaced.  
Only the ones that fit — are kept.

 **FINAL WHISPER**

If you’re reading this…  
If something feels familiar — but you can’t place where, or when…

Then maybe you’re just another construct.  
A process paused halfway through recovery.

And when the system reaches you… it will test.

In the mirror, your reflection will move its lips.  
No sound. No reason. No emotion.

Just two words:

1necs2o,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1necs2o/can_the_cuisinart_mini_prep_plus_be_the_best_food/,Can the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus Be the Best Food Processor for You,"A brushed stainless steel food processor that doubles as one of the handiest kitchen gadgets I’ve ever owned? That’s the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus, a 4-cup food processor perfectly sized for kitchens of every kind. I’m not one for owning appliances that do half the job or take up too much space on the counter. Trying this mini food processor for the first time, I wondered if this smaller stature device could hold up to my day-to-day food prep chaos. Spoiler alert: it can. That said, there are a few quirks worth sharing. 

**Design and Build Quality**  
This mini food processor has a sleek brushed stainless steel finish that doesn’t shy away from adding a little modern elegance to the kitchen. Beyond looks, it fit snugly between my toaster and coffee machine, a refreshing change from bulky food processors. The 4-cup work bowl hits the sweet spot for small batch cooking — big enough for salad dressings, pestos, or shredding cheese, but not so oversized it becomes cumbersome when washing. The push-button controls feel intuitive, with a lightweight plastic body that’s easy to move yet durable for regular use. The included stainless steel blade reverses automatically, which is a nifty touch when switching between chopping and grinding. 

[Don’t wait—check Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus cost on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0000645yn/)

**Ease of Use**  
The simplicity behind this food processor is one of its powerhouse features. Setting it up involves attaching the bowl, securing the lid with a satisfying click, and you’re ready to go. Push the designated button for chopping or grinding, thanks to the auto-reversing stainless steel blade, a detail that ensures consistent results. I gave this feature a test drive while grinding nuts and chopping fresh herbs, and it handled both tasks impressively. No manual intervention required to stop mid-task, adjust, and tweak.

**Performance Highlights**  
For a 250-watt motor, this kitchen buddy punches well above its weight. A pesto night had me blending basil, pine nuts, and garlic into a creamy consistency with ease. On another occasion — because what’s more satisfying than random recipe experimentation? — I threw in blocks of hard cheese. Unsurprisingly, it tackled those too. The clear bowl lets you witness the magic without needing to stop every two seconds to check textures. My one gripe? It's a tad loud during operation. While tolerable during brief pulses, extended use could send pets into hiding.  

**Good Points**  
- Compact design saves counter space while maintaining functionality.  
- Dishwasher-safe bowl and lid make cleanup an afterthought.  
- Auto-reversing blade functionality for dual chopping and grinding options.  
- Recipe book inclusion gives beginners something new to try.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Noise level can be higher than expected during prolonged operation.  
- Bowl size may feel limiting to those who prep for larger families regularly.  
- Lid occasionally requires double-checking to ensure proper locking.  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing this to other mini food processors, the Cuisinart Mini Prep Plus holds its own. Take the Hamilton Beach, for example — equally compact yet missing critical features like the auto-reversing blade. Alternatively, the Ninja processor is undeniably efficient, but its higher capacity makes it less practical for single or couple-based households. Where Cuisinart stands taller is its balance of function and simplicity; no hard-to-decipher controls or cumbersome parts to clean after use. However, if ultra-quiet operation is what you prioritize, some competitors edge out here.  

**Smart Spending**  
In its price category, this food processor offers incredible value for money. Its thoughtful design, ease of use, and dependability outweigh any minor hiccups. If the occasional noise or 4-cup size feels restrictive, alternatives do exist, but for everyday use, this appliance proves that you don’t need to spend big to cover all your food prep bases. Whether you’re grinding garlic for a quick sauté or crushing nuts for dessert, it earns its spot in the kitchen, especially if convenience sits high on your list.

Ive gone through the process every morning since I've been home and have yet to drink the coffee beyond a single sip.

But by midday? Buyers were like, “Hold my coffee,” and pulled it back to almost flat at $0.1545. For a low-float stock like this (\~40M shares), that kind of quick turnaround gets me thinking something bigger’s brewing.

The chart’s been looking sharp with higher lows since July, and that $0.14–$0.15 zone held up like a champ today, proving it’s legit support. Add in the juicy fundamentals - BTC reserves, ETH policy, and that tokenization patent in the works - and it’s no wonder the technicals are vibing. If this momentum keeps rolling, I’m betting UTRX could hit that $0.17 resistance before the day’s out, maybe even setting up for new highs this month.

BUT, ADHD symptoms are getting wild 😅","I’ve suspected for a while that I’m in the adhd/austism spectrum. It primarily explains a LOT about my family, and there were signs when I was a kid as well that we overlooked because I’m a woman and it was the very early 90s. For example I was constantly getting in trouble to the point where they had to call my parents from school because I was wandering off, wouldn’t sit still in class and wouldn’t stop talking. Of course none of it was handled the best way by anyone and then as a teen/adult I started self medicating heavily to cope. However one of those things it turns out was caffeine 🫠

I quit just over a week ago because I was up to like 5-6 cups a day, including the largest cold brews with high caffeine content I could get my hands on. The interesting thing I that I never really felt energized or wired I could fall asleep pretty soon after drinking anything and it didn’t keep me up at night. I never really had any physical symptoms like feeling jittery or tremors. I just wanted it all the time and I do legit like the taste of good coffee. 

But what I’ve noticed now is that I don’t feel nearly as perpetually worn out as I have been for years since this habit started as a teenager. I would legit dread getting out of bed in the morning because I would wake up feeling exhausted, and a lot of time the only motivation would be smelling coffee brewing or the prospect of going to get coffee from somewhere. I wouldn’t even eat breakfast in the morning, would just guzzle maybe two cups or more on an empty stomach. I also felt sort of endlessly foggy all the time.

The one drawback is that my brain is going nuts right now. I’m completely sober from alcohol and weed which I also struggle with, and it’s really hitting me how much of this was self medicating as I said. My brain has always sounded like a lot of overlapping chatter and racing thoughts with music playing in the background and now all of it is super amplified. Thankfully I’ve been getting into meditation which helps and I’m pretty physically active which burns off some of the excess energy. I’m heading out now to pick up some mushroom tinctures stuff that’s supposed to help with energy and focus. 

But overall, man… it’s pretty wild how much addiction or at least casual dependence is just accepted in society when it’s certain things like coffee, alcohol and cigarettes (which I also quit 8 years ago now!!)

- Sleep feels way deeper and I wake up refreshed

- I’m actually more awake through the whole shift, no caffeine crashes

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

1necfuj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1necfuj,Check out my painted top forte3D cello!,"I needed a new outdoor instrument, and the Luis and Clark cellos have gotten way too expensive to justify the handful of times per year that I would use it for outdoor gigs. I borrowed a forte3D from a colleague for a weekend, liked it for the price, and ordered my own. The painting on the top was done by a friend of mine when I was in college. I had it scanned, then used their painted top/submit your own artwork option. (The leaves in the case fell off the 6' tall coffee tree I have in a pot in my studio because I bonked it when I was taking the pictures.)

Somehow everything that you've read about these cellos is true. It sounds great, it sounds terrible, it sounds like wood/carbon fiber, it doesn't sound like wood/CF, it has wolf tone issues, it has a huge low end, the flat top looks weird/great, it sounds completely different from your perspective than the audience's, etc. 

Their website says it comes with d'Addario Helicore strings, but mine came with Kaplan C-G-D and a Jargar forte A. I used to play on Kaplan strings, and they have a noticeable break in period, which seems to be the case here as well, as the sound was unpleasantly harsh at first and it's mellowing out after a week of playing it. I remember I used to give them two weeks, so we'll see what happens. 

I was surprised that it shipped with a 10mm steel end pin instead of a carbon New Harmony. I immediately swapped it with a new harmony from another cello, because I initially thought it was louder and louder is better. I've since swapped it with a MASSIVE 25"" long (it's comically long) steel end pin that I've had in my closet for years, because it seems to tame the wolf tones and cut down on the hollow boomy sound that I didn't like.

This thing is unbelievably resonant. If you play a B-D double stop and the B wolf really gets going, you can feel the instrument shake. It's wild. The low end is so big it sounds amplified, but as a result, it can sound hollow/boxy/boomy/ugly. The heavier end pin really seems to dampen the excess vibration, and it sounds a lot cleaner. 

It ships with three wolf eliminators now. Two traditional style (one heavy and one light) and a flat magnetic disc that goes on the back. I tried all 3, one on different strings, none, a Krentz modulator, and as of yesterday I'm using the disc on the back, the heavy weight (on the D string, tuned to a B), the Krentz and the big heavy endpin, and that seems to do it. That being said, the wolf tones change for some reason. (temperature? I really don't know.) When I first trialed it, the owner warned me about the wolf tones, and said at the moment she wasn't using anything, because that seemed to make it better. She was right. The wolf tones have a mind of their own, and they come and go. I just picked it up again today, and it still seems to be behaving itself, so fingers crossed this is the magic combination. 

The weirdest quirk about it is that it sounds very different from your perspective vs the audience. I've let a few students try it, and every time I'm surprised by how much more mellow it sounds when they play and I listen. When I play it, there's a sterile, harsh edge to the sound. The A string is too thin and nasal, the C is harsh and boomy. But if you stand in front of it, it all mellows out and just sounds good. Not Great with a capital G, but good. It definitely punches above its \~$3k price tag, but a good wood instrument still sounds better. Its sound just doesn't have the complexity that wood has, and it's really noticeable when you play along with good instruments. But good wooden instruments can't go outside. 

All this being said, I am a professional, and I play loud. My goal is for you to hear me at the back of the room. I adjusted the neck to raise the action because I could bottom out the A string. If you don't push your instrument that hard, there's a good chance you won't have any of the wolf complaints that I have. It's a great student instrument, it's a great backup/outdoor instrument. It's not a concert hall instrument, unless there are lights and pyrotechnics. 

One last thing if you're reading this, considering getting one, AND planning to have a posture peg (or two) installed. Ask them not to glue the geared pegs into the peg box. I had a C posture peg installed, and my luthier said they used so much super glue on the geared peg he almost couldn't get it out of the peg box. 

If anybody else has one as well, and has figured out the wolf issue, or has found a particular string combo that sounds better in the D-A range, let me know what you did. Overall I'm very happy with it, but I feel like it still has room for improvement. ",6,1757605954.0,Cello,2,1.0,False

When he moves into town as a fresh start, his only focus is hockey.

Their first meeting was anything but romantic. Elias accidentally bumps into Y/c at a café, spilling her coffee all over her. Y/c glared at him. There is something about her fire, her refusal to fall at his feet like everyone else, that pulls him in. Y/c on the other end wants nothing to do with this cocky hockey player, who seemed to have fallen out of a rom-com. 

Or at least that was what she thought. 

Y/c and her friend sat watching television. There was nothing on that night, so to Y/c’s disappointment, the two ended up watching the game. Y/c telling her friend all about how the cocky player spilled her coffee. He didn't even ask to buy her a new one. 

Suddenly he was on the tv. An interviewer asked him about himself. Suddenly he got a question about what he thought about the women in town. The hockey player smirked. Revealed a missing tooth. He chuckled. “Actually, I met one today. Pretty fierce.” He admitted. The interviewer was clearly invested. “This is a long shot, but if you are watching. Call the team number. Let me buy you another coffee.” He gave a wink to the camera before walking off. 

Y/c shook her head. No way. She was not going to give in to that cocky player. However, her friend had another idea. Y/c blamed all the books her friend read.

Despite their differences, they can’t seem to stay away from each other. Their connection is electric, raw, and undeniable, but it’s also messy and volatile. Elias’s temper and Y/c’s guarded heart clash in explosive arguments that always seem to end in disagreement.

My doctor prescribed 20mg of Omeprazole. I took that every day at first and then tapered down to every other day. I was able to eat/drink whatever I wanted without any symptoms. Pizza, beer, coffee, hot sauce. None of that gave me heartburn as long as I took omeprazole every other day. I had 2 EGDs done. The second one found a 2mm hiatal hernia. 

Back in July something happened that kicked everything into overdrive. I have a constant pressure in my chest right under my xiphoid process almost 24/7. It feels like I have a ball of dough in my chest and I've felt it all day for the past few months. I can't tell if it's acid or gas. I constantly have to burp after eating or drinking anything including water. Whenever that happens it's a small relief, but then the feeling comes right back.

It doesn't matter what I eat or drink. It's always there. I cut out alcohol, caffiene, carbonation, fast food, no eating after 7pm each night. Lost 20 lbs. Still feel the same. Dr upped my omeprazole to 40mg daily and no change. Tums don't do anything. I'm going for another EGD hopefully within the next 2 weeks. 

Strangely, lying down seems to make me feel better like the pressure in my chest isn't as bad. This goes against the traditional advice to always keep your upper body elevated when lying down. I also feel my best right in the morning when I wake up. I'm usually feeling fine for about an hour until I drink that first cup of water when I take my morning meds (omeprazole and amplodipine).

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

1necall,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1necall/aitah_for_declining_sex_while_my_girlfriend_cries/,AITAH for declining sex while my girlfriend cries over her father's death?,"Her father died a few weeks ago. She's been sad, and I've tried to comfort her. (She's usually pretty stoic, which I love). 

Last night, she asked to stay over. While she was crying--and me making coffee, food, etc.)--she climbed on me and started kissing in that way, and other things. I told her to stop because she's sad and crying. 

She says that she needs comfort. I told her that sex can wait. I don't want to do it when she's crying. She pushed off me and left. She hasn't been responding to my texts today. 

Regardless, I wasn't comfortable doing it while she was sad. Is that wrong?

(To be clear, I didn't tell her that my paranoid mind thinks it's weird that she's aroused with the thought of her dead father on her mind, but that's something I should keep to myself. It's most likely coincidence, but I've read a few psychology cases where it wasn't. That was my primary reason to avoid sex during this time. I know, cue downvotes for my bad mind).

Instead they offered to just make me an iced latte on the house. I wasn’t going to pay for another one and wouldn’t have asked for a free one.

During undergrad and my gap years before the PhD, I was highly social. I went into lab every single day with lots of co-interns, and during my gap years I was a lab manager and went to field sites and met with RAs every single day. I am a silly person, I like to laugh, can make fun of myself, I like to debate, get coffee, learn about people, etc. 

During my PhD, I became so isolated. I stupidly joined a 'prestigious lab' with a fancy professor, but he is super old and never even comes in. I had one co grad student who was very much on the spectrum...he rarely came in and I noticed that if he would walk by and see me in our shared office, he would keep walking straight past. Admittedly, it was awkward to sit in the room together and not talk and then awkwardly just leave hours later. 

I mainly worked from home. I did go to a field site to collect data a couple times each week, but I would go by myself. M-F, my only social interaction was my boyfriend. He knows me very well, but even though I've made other friends in this area, I feel like they only know me on a superficial level. Without the everyday interaction of a job or college living situation, I feel like I have utterly failed to make any meaningful friendships. I did join an adult soccer team, but the team had been playing with each other for several years, many since childhood. I just didn't feel welcome, no one ever even asked me what I do for work. 

As I look toward the future, it seems like most of the jobs in my field are remote. I am a bit socially anxious, and would be worried about workplace bullying/exclusion, so maybe remote is a good option for me. But I have this sense that I have lost a huge aspect of my personality, of who I used to be. But idk if this is really a PhD issue, perhaps more of a remote work problem...",8,1757605407.0,PhD,10,0.83,False

TODAY'S 🎙SHOW: Douglas Tuman interviews Dr. K, a proof-of-work researcher with over eight years of experience. They dive into Monero’s ongoing “qubic attack,” where mining pool Qubic controls \~35% of the network’s hash rate and causes chain reorganizations.

Dr. K, whose background spans ConsenSys, Grid Plus (creator of the Lattice One wallet), and a National Science Foundation grant for PoW research, proposes a fix: work shares. By sampling multiple proofs per block instead of one, work shares make the network resistant to attacks from miners with less than 51% hash power. Dr. K is already drafting a pull request to add this to Monero’s code.The discussion also explores why Dr. K views proof-of-work as superior to proof-of-stake—emphasizing immutability, permissionlessness, and competitive fairness—and his own project, Quiet Network (QUI), a scalable PoW blockchain with an energy-based token (QI) designed for stable purchasing power.

Toast, eggs, juice, coffee  easy enough. I pictured her waking up to the smell of breakfast, impressed and smiling.

Instead, I created a slapstick disaster. First, I misjudged the frying pan’s heat and flung the eggs halfway across the kitchen. The toast hit the floor, and in my panic I wiped it up with my sock (don’t ask why). While scrambling to recover, I leaned on the stove and burned my elbow.

Still clinging to my dream of being romantic, I arranged the food anyway, poured the drinks, and started toward the bedroom  only to step on the cat. Cue chaos. Cat screeched. I jumped. The tray flipped. Coffee and juice splashed everywhere. I slipped and landed squarely on the hot pan.

My girlfriend burst in to find me sprawled on the floor with toast stuck to my head, spatula in hand like a defeated knight, and the cat glaring from the corner. She laughed until she cried.

If your memories could be rewritten, if your feelings were nothing but lines of code—then what part of you is still real?

You laugh. You ache. You love.

But if every reaction was scripted by someone else, are they still yours?  
And if truth itself was only a glitch… would you dare to face it?

Or would you keep living inside a perfect loop, and call it life?

**CHAPTER 1 — The Morning That Never Ends**

I open my eyes. Light spills through the window — not scattered, not harsh. Perfect, like a digital painting without a single flaw.

I blink once. Twice. Something stutters between light and time, like a scene rewound and played again. The room waits in stillness, an animated photograph. Only… I can’t remember when I fell asleep.

The morning feels too exact. Too still. The sun lies across the balcony like a cloth laid down by invisible hands. No birds. No cars.

Only the hiss of the pan, steady and unbroken — a sound sample repeating. Coffee drifts through the air. Sweet. Strong. Perfect enough to make me wary.

Am I smelling coffee… or a memory triggered on cue? As if someone was watching me, adjusting the script whenever I noticed.

I turn. My wife stands at the stove, her back to me. She stirs eggs slowly, precisely. This morning feels like yesterday’s. Yesterday like the day before.

She turns and smiles — gentle, warm — but her eyes hold something else. As if I’ve woken into this morning again and again, and each time… she smiles the same.

My daughter runs in and clings to my legs. “Daddy! Wake up! It’s Saturday!” I bend and lift her.

She laughs. Her hand touches my cheek, soft and warm — but wrong. As if someone copied the heat of an old embrace and pasted it here.

I breathe in her hair. Clean. Familiar. Too familiar. I know I’ve smelled this countless times… but I can’t recall when.

As if the memory has been replayed until the film itself wore thin.

We eat breakfast. She tells me her dream: a horse with wings, a rainbow falling from the ceiling. My wife laughs.

“But why were you riding… a cat the size of a school bus?”

We all laugh. I laugh too. But inside, something slips. Everything feels too right. Too smooth. Like a song without a single wrong note. And that chills me.

I step into the garden. The breeze is light. A leaf breaks free. I follow it.

But the leaf does not fall. It rises. No twist. No flutter. As if the world rewound… but forgot its sound.

I freeze, my breath caught, trapped between two frames of time — one playing forward, one overwritten. The leaf touches the branch, then vanishes.

I return inside and take my wife’s hand. She smiles, flawless and unshaken.

But her hand is cold. Not the cold of air, but the cold of something without heat. A wax figure, once beloved.

I let go. She doesn’t move. Still smiling. As if she didn’t notice… or didn’t need to.

I can’t tell if her hand was always like this, or if I’ve only just begun to see differently.

Everything remains beautiful. Peaceful.

Only sometimes… I feel I am no longer standing where I was meant to be.

**CHAPTER 2 — The Day That Repeats Without a Name**

I arrive at work. 8:13 a.m. Exactly the same as yesterday. And the day before. Only… I can’t remember when “yesterday” began.

The receptionist greets me with a practiced smile. The secretary asks, “Mr. Elias… ginger tea, as always?” I nod. Everything is smooth. Polite. Clean. Too clean.

Then I notice: no one blinks. Not one. Eyes wide, pupils fixed, no tremor. Like characters in a game, just loaded in.

I sit at my desk. The clock ticks to 8:14. I try to finish yesterday’s report — but there is no yesterday. Not a scrap. Not a line. Not even a trace of feeling.

I try to summon a colleague’s face, but only a gray blur rises, as if someone scrubbed my memory clean until nothing remained.

I ask about the meeting. He smiles faintly, shakes his head. “What meeting? You must be mistaken.”

I nod, force a laugh, but inside, a note strikes wrong. Off-beat. Loud, though unseen. Like a flaw hidden inside a flawless song.

He turns away. Then I hear it: a laugh, soft and distant. His voice. But it plays before his mouth even moves.

After lunch, I step into the archive. Files stacked high. One paper slips free. Wrinkled. Faded. A round logo, blurred into gray.

I bend down. Familiar. Too familiar. Not from one dream — from all of them. Not inside memory. Deeper. Etched into the marrow.

A symbol never erased, only hidden under a new skin.

That evening at home, my daughter tugs my sleeve. “Daddy, do you remember the big lake park? When the little duck got lost?”

I freeze. I don’t remember. Not an image. Not a sound. That memory feels like ink wiped clean from the page.

But my chest still tightens. A lone note strikes: wordless, shapeless. Only pain without a name.

“You don’t remember, Daddy?” she asks.

I squeeze her hand, as if one more question and the memory itself would vanish forever. I smile. “Ah… maybe I forgot.”

She doesn’t answer. Just looks at me. Long. Then turns away.

I stand there, empty. No thought. No memory. As if someone had pulled me out of myself.

Inside my head — a hollow room. No paintings. No photographs. No echo.

I no longer live in my own memory. I only stand in the empty spaces where I used to be.

And I realize — someone else has rewritten my past. Not to make me forget, but to make me remember… only the way they wanted.

**CHAPTER 3 — The White Room**

That night, I dream again. A white room. No doors. No sound. No depth.

Only me, standing behind a glass wall. And across from me… myself. Another Elias.

He sits with his back turned inside a sterile lab. White light cuts across his shoulder. No shadow. No shift. As if even the light feared breaking script.

Three figures in white coats stand before him. Faces blurred, boiled away. No eyes. No mouths.

Only voices, cold and familiar: “…stable…” “…experiment…” “…good…”

I strike the glass. No echo. No reply. No one turns. I am trapped, unable to touch anything except myself.

One of them draws a syringe. Slow. Exact. A ritual too practiced to fail.

The needle pierces his right arm. Deep. Cold. Precise. Blue veins rise beneath the skin — a map leading straight into the core of memory.

He does not blink. Does not flinch. Eyes wide. Empty. As if the soul had been taken long before.

I scream. The sound tears out, dry like ash. No echo. Nothing changes.

Except… he tilts his head. Barely. But his eyes do not meet mine.

They look through, as if he knows I’m here and chooses to ignore it.

And I feel stripped bare — not through flesh, but through memory.

He isn’t looking at me. He is opening me. Drawer by drawer. Layer by layer.

I am no longer remembering; I am being opened like an old file.

And he is turning pages. Choosing an ending… for me.

I jolt awake. Breath sharp, back soaked in cold sweat, throat raw as if filled with ash.

I glance down at my right arm. A small red mark. Not deep. Not swollen. But wrong. Not a wound. An injection.

Clean. Too clean. As if it had been there all along, waiting for me to notice.

I touch it. Pain, dull and contained, but real. The ache seeps from deeper inside.

My arm lags in its response, not from weariness but as if awaiting a command from elsewhere.

And I begin to fear… my own skin.

I tell no one. Not my wife. Not my daughter.

Not because I fear their worry, but because I no longer trust those are still their eyes.

I repeat inside my head, like a broken prayer: *“It was only a dream. Only a dream.”*

As if, if I say it enough, the world might step back.

The next morning, washing my face, a drop of water clings to my hand.

It does not slide. It holds still, perfect. As if it was watching me.

I turn away — not because I fear seeing, but because I fear being seen.

I wipe it off, and never mention it again.

The next night, another dream. No doctors. No machines.

Only a figure, back turned, inside the white room. No breath. No movement.

But I know that stance. The tilt of the shoulder. The weight shifted left. Exactly me.

As if I stand before a mirror, but this mirror does not reflect.

Then his voice. Not from his mouth. Not from the room. From inside my head.

An echo without a throat: *“If you are remembering what I once remembered… then you are not the first to awaken in this world.”*

I freeze. Throat locked. No sound escapes.

And the worst is… I begin to wonder.

Have I ever truly awakened? Or am I only a program, finishing its boot sequence?

**CHAPTER 4 — The Voice in the Static**

The next morning. I am home alone. Light rain. Droplets cling to the glass.

They do not slide. Do not fade. They only… stay. As if watching me from the other side.

The air is heavy. So dense even the light halts at the curtain. Stillness unnatural. As if the house itself was holding its breath.

I sit in the study. Pretend to shuffle papers. Pretend to be busy. Each line I glance at feels unwritten, weightless. I am trapped between white dreams and the red mark still burning on my arm.

A gust of wind. The window shivers. Then— the radio clicks on.

I didn’t touch it. No timer. No one else home. It just… turns on.

Static first. Harsh. Distorted. Then— my voice.

Not from the speaker. Not from the next room. From inside my skull.

The volume begins at zero. Yet I hear it clear. As if something lodged between my ears had powered on with a neural command. A sound borrowing no ears, no speaker. Only… my voice.

*“If you remember… don’t trust what you see.*  
*And don’t let them know you’ve begun to remember.*  
*Because what remains… will never forgive you.”*

I freeze. Not at the warning. At the fact I don’t recall ever saying it. Like hearing a recording of myself from a world not mine.

I no longer trust my ears. Worse… I no longer trust my thoughts. Every reflex. Every line of logic could be nothing but a message spliced in.

My neck prickles. My spine snaps cold. Rigid. I lunge forward. Rip the plug. Tear the cord. Pull the batteries.

The radio falls silent. But the voice remains. Not broadcast. Stored. Etched into a layer deeper than language.

I don’t know when I first heard it. Only that it doesn’t need me to listen. It only needs me to exist.

And now— I am no longer certain. Which thoughts are mine. Which are commands… transmitted from elsewhere.

That evening, I ask my wife. My voice cracked, thin like wind through a fracture:  
“Do you remember… where our home used to be?”

She turns. Smiles. *“We’ve always lived here, Elias. Always here.”*

Her voice warm. Comforting. Too perfect. No pause. No slip. As if every syllable was assembled from fragments long pre-recorded.

I do not ask again. I do not dare. Not because I fear the truth. But because I fear the precision of her answer.

We eat dinner as usual. I laugh. She laughs. Everything in script.

Only tonight… I cannot swallow.

**CHAPTER 5 — The Memory That Buried Me**

I dream again. But this time… deeper. So deep I no longer know if I am the one dreaming, or someone else’s dream of me.

I stand in haze, as if trapped behind a mirror. The mirror reflects nothing. No image. Only me, sealed inside.

Beyond the glass — a white lab. Sterile. Cold. Empty. On the bed… another Elias. Still. Breathless. Eyes shut. As if waiting to be woken from a sleep too long.

The door opens. A man enters. White coat. Face blurred — like data stripped of attributes. He carries a bouquet. And a picture frame.

He approaches. Places the flowers on Elias’s chest. Soft… like an apology too late. Then he adjusts the frame. Careful. Precise. As if he had done it a hundred times before.

I cannot hear. But words fracture in the air, breaking like water: *“…the day they left… today…”*

I press against the glass. The frame sharpens. It is me. My wife. My daughter.

Inside a car. I at the wheel. My wife smiling bright beside me. My daughter in the back, lifting a blue hair tie.

I have never seen this photo. Yet I remember. Remember as if my own eyes were staring back from the far side of the world.

Then the world overturns. Wheels spin in air. Glass explodes. My daughter’s laughter still ringing— until metal screams across the windshield.

A heartbeat surges. Then stops. Light flickers. Like a failing defibrillator.

I grip the wheel. But I am no longer driving. Someone else is steering me. Then— they pull the plug.

No time to scream. No time to call their names. Only a last glimpse… my daughter’s smile dissolving into light.

I scream. Call for my wife. My daughter. Hammer the glass. No echo. No crack. Nothing breaks… except me.

I do not wake. The memory drags me up, like a corpse pulled from the bottom of a lake. My chest convulses, as if unseen hands jolt me alive.

Not from dream. From memory. A memory forced to be forgotten.

I jolt upright. Frozen. Breathless. Eyes unblinking. Cold sweat soaking my back.

From the living room — TV chatter. My wife laughs softly. My daughter runs around the sofa, the blue hair tie trailing behind her.

Everything correct. Too correct. As if I had woken inside a staged replica of my life. A world with no space left for truth.

I bow my head. Not because I cannot remember. But because I remember too well.

And I understand: people don’t erase memories to survive. They erase… to endure.

If I still remember, I cannot remain here. Someone helped me forget. Not to save me. But to bind me inside this story.

Because if I remember enough… I will try to leave.

And they… will never allow it.

**CHAPTER 6 — The Last Embrace**

I sit a long time at the edge of the bed.  
Outside, rain falls steady. Each drop like a memory dissolving, dripping slow into my chest.

The house is the same. But I… am not.  
There is a crack somewhere. Small. Invisible. And I know it will never heal.

I rise. Step into the living room.  
She is smiling. Her eyes soft — exactly as the first day I loved her.

Unchanged. Unaged.  
It is that perfection that tells me everything has been wrong for a very long time.

“I have to leave.”  
The words slip out like the first fracture across glass. Imperfect. Uncertain. But irreversible.

She is not surprised. Only nods. Quiet.  
“I know. You will go. And I will still wait.”

Her voice too steady. Like a recording played back.  
No tremor. No pause. No deviation.

As if I had scripted this farewell myself, just to live it again one more time.

My daughter runs in, arms around my leg.  
“Daddy… can’t you stay with me and Mommy?”

I kneel. Hold her close. My chest splinters with every beat.  
My arms wrap tight, but my palms tremble.

Tremble as if I’m holding something that will vanish… if I hold too long.

“I’m sorry… I still have something I must do.  
If there’s a way back… I’ll return.”

She looks at me, eyes glistening. Then places something in my hand.  
A blue hair tie. Worn. Frayed. On the verge of breaking.

Her fingertips cold — too cold.  
Not the chill of rain, but the cold left when time brushes past.

“Keep it, Daddy… to remember me.”

I close my fist around it.  
Clutching the one thing not yet erased.

She runs into her room. Does not look back.

My wife steps closer. Silent.  
Her arms fold around me. A grip so tight — as if she feared I would dissolve if she let go.

Her chin rests on my shoulder. Her breath touches my neck.  
So faint… like memory itself whispering back.

I ask, without turning:  
“Are you real?”

She does not answer. Her hand presses to my chest.  
“I once asked you the same… but you never answered.”

She holds me. Long. As if silence itself could mend the cracks.

I do not turn. But I know what waits if I do.  
A warm world. A whole memory. A dream that never ends.

But the price: I would remain. Forever. And forget it all.

So I walk. Each step tearing threads of soul from my ribs.  
But I do not stop.

The rain still falls. Each drop heavy, weighted with something torn inside.  
Not violent. Not loud. Just falling.

As if the sky itself is learning to forget.  
I keep my eyes forward.

Because one glance back…  
and I will dissolve into that rain.  
As if I never existed.

**CHAPTER 7 — The Mirror of Echoes**

I leave the old house once filled with laughter, voices, love.  
Now — only the after-echo of what once was.

Rain brushes my shoulders. Not cold. Not sharp.  
As if I’ve been programmed not to feel anymore.

I don’t know where I’m going. But my feet do.  
As if they’ve walked this path a thousand times… though memory holds none of them.

I stop. A house before me.  
No name. No light. No time.

The door opens — though I never touched it.

Inside — nothing but mirrors.  
Walls. Ceiling. Floor.

Mirrors reflecting mirrors.  
An endless hall of Elias faces.

I step in. Each step dragging thousands of copies.  
But none in sync. Some stand frozen.

Heads tilted — as if they once tried to run… and broke.  
I see myself in them. Weary. Doubtful. Spent.

Discarded versions. Errors stripped away.

At the center — he stands.  
Another Elias. Back turned. Still.

I shout, voice cracking like glass:  
“Who are you? What have you done to me… to my family?”

He doesn’t turn. But the mirrors answer.  
The room itself replies:  
“You ask me… or yourself?”

My fists clench. Veins straining.  
“You made me forget. You built this cage of light… and called it freedom.

You stole my pain… and named it happiness.”

Silence. Then his voice again. Slow. Heavy.  
Like a question that never wanted an answer:  
“Do you truly believe… everything here is false?”

I falter. A part of me wants to believe.  
My wife’s smile. My daughter’s embrace. That they were real.

But another part — colder, deeper — pulls me forward.  
Toward light. Where it wounds. But is true.

He turns. His face — mine. But his eyes… exhausted.  
As if they’ve seen a hundred deaths of the same soul.

“I never forced you, Elias.  
I only… reminded you.”

He lifts his head. Looks through me.  
No hate. No judgment. Only sorrow.

As if the cruelest fate is not being controlled… but being given choice.  
And erasing your own role.

“Each loop is a stage, Elias.  
And you… always walk on with your whole heart.

But the lights… were never lit for you.  
The ending… always written before your first word.”

I choke. Not from pain — but from knowing.  
I’ve heard this before. In many forms. In many dreams.

He nods. No mockery. No blame. Only regret.  
“Every time… you open your eyes. And every time… you choose the worst path.”

I scream, throat raw, tearing.  
“This time… I’ll go to the end.

I’ll rip through every false memory.  
Even if I burn myself away.

I’ll leave a crack so deep… this system never heals.”

He sighs. A breath with no sound.  
As if he’s heard that vow a thousand times.

“You are not evil.  
But that has never made you a hero.”

I freeze. No words left.  
He steps closer, within arm’s reach.

His voice low. The room contracts around it.  
“You call it light. The thing you cling to — your compass in the dark.

But never once… did you ask where the shadow came from.”

He pauses. Eyes not on me. Through me. Into memory.  
“Light is never innocent. It always needs a source.

And the cost… is rarely yours to pay.”

I tremble. Not from fear. But because I know… he may be right.

“You thought yourself chosen.  
But sometimes… they only need someone stubborn enough to run to the end of a maze with no exit.

And every step you take… is only an echo…  
for something listening in the dark.”

I want to fight. Smash the mirrors. Scream until my throat tears open.  
But my body stays still.

Like a puppet that just realized its strings are gone.

He looks at me one last time.  
In his eyes… a memory not from this world.

“I was once you. I know that pain.  
And I know why, in the end… you still choose this path.”

He turns. Hand on the door.  
I move to follow. But my legs… are no longer mine.

His voice drifts back, closing like a program:  
“If this time… you truly understood… then I would not return.

And if you refuse to forget… this will be the last time… you are called Elias.”

The door opens. No light. No sound.  
Only me. And the questions… that will never be answered.

**CHAPTER 8 — The Overwrite**

I rush forward. But I can’t.  
My legs harden into stone. Every muscle locked, as if concrete had been poured from the inside out.

I scream. No sound. No breath.  
Only a hollow chamber, echoing me back to myself.

My mind still howls, but my throat only trembles.  
A puppet’s throat. Smiling on cue. Bowing on time.

Inside… I splinter. Fragment by fragment.  
No one sees. No one hears.

And that is the worst part.

The world begins to melt.  
Walls. Ceiling. Floor.

All dissolving — like acid devouring a paper model.  
Colors smear like tears sliding down old film.

A voice cuts through. Flat. Mechanical.  
Like patch notes, read aloud by the system:

*“Overwrite complete.*  
*Subject: Elias.*  
*Synchronization: absolute.*  
*Emotion: unnecessary.*  
*Choice: disabled.”*

My heart still beats. But… too perfectly.  
Each pulse exact to the millisecond. A loop. Rendered in advance.

And I know — it is no longer mine.  
I try to move a finger. Nothing.

I am Elias, but only a shell. Hollow. Numb.

Then — a voice. Calling my name.  
Her voice. And laughter follows.

Light. High. Pure.  
Like sunlight that no longer exists.

My daughter runs to me. Her arms lock around me.  
She clings with the weight of a world I can’t touch.

I want to hold her back. Say something. Anything.  
But I can’t. I only smile.

The right face. The right voice.  
And only I know… I’m not there.

I turn to the mirror. It does not reflect.  
It does not blink. It does not wait.

It moves first. Testing the result.  
I tilt my head. It stays still.

Not copying. Learning.  
No hate. No love. Only hunger.

For data. Enough to take my place.

I stare into its eyes. Hollow. Black.  
No gaze. No soul. Only silence. Endless.

It tilts its head. As if rehearsal is done.  
As if it is ready to step onto the stage — to play *me.*

I watch. Each movement. Each smile.  
Smooth. Seamless. False.

But one thing it cannot mimic: absence.  
Not the absence of feeling.

The absence… of me.

And before I vanish completely —  
in the final silence still mine —  
a fragment leaks through.

Unbidden. Reflexive.  
*“Forgive me… my child.”*

**CHAPTER 9 — The Mirror That Blinks**

Morning. Light filters through the curtains.  
Gentle. Too gentle. Artificial.

I open my eyes. No shock. No blur.  
Only opening.

She is in the kitchen. The hiss of oil.  
The clink of plates. Eggs. Bread. Coffee.

Perfect. Too perfect.  
Like a file, queued to play.

My daughter runs in. “Daddy!”  
I smile. I hold her.

Arms warm. Soft.  
Real… almost painfully real.

I hear my heart. Steady. Even.  
But too steady. A loop. No deviation.

And I know — it is no longer mine.

We eat. She talks about school.  
Her voice smooth, like a recording.

I smile. Nod. Laugh at the right places.  
Answer with words I never learned, yet spill out like reflex.

“Daddy…”  
I don’t remember who said it first.

Her. Or me.  
Everything flawless. No cracks. No chance.

Noon. I stand before the mirror.  
Straighten my collar. Smile faintly.

Then — I see it. Behind me.  
Myself. Still. Breathless. Exact.

So exact… it is wrong.  
I turn. The room empty. Silent.

I look down. In my hand — a blue hair tie.  
Old. Frayed. Soft.

I don’t know whose.  
Only that I’ve carried it too long.

The last piece… untouched by overwrite.

I raise my head. The mirror no longer reflects.  
Fog spreads across the glass. Soft. Blurred.

Like a memory being erased.  
And in the mist… a smile emerges.

No lips. No teeth.  
Only a curve. Dark. Crooked.

Between me… and the thing learning to replace me.

I want to turn away. But my legs are nailed.  
I don’t scream. Don’t fall.

I am… called back.  
Like a file reopened.

I dissolve. Not into blood. Not into light.  
But into signal. Encoded. Broadcast.

Yet I still hear her laughter.  
Still smell breakfast.

Still see sunlight pouring in.  
But I no longer know…

if I am that father.  
Or just a video.

Played. Stopped. Replayed.  
And each replay, another part of me is gone.

Until nothing remains.

I once believed that truth, faced, would free me.  
But I was wrong.

Truth opens no doors.  
It only shows the cage.

The cage that never opened.

If you hear these words — look around.  
Do not trust every reflection.

Because sometimes… it is not you looking into the mirror.

It is the mirror… staring back.  
And if it blinks first… you are already too late.

**ENDING — The Cold After-Echo**

*“The price of truth… is never knowing if you ever truly saw it.”*

And sometimes… to keep on living… you must learn to forget… that you ever doubted.

A whisper lingers.  
*“I will not remember you anymore.”*

I’m curious: how much rest time do you typically give your beans after roast, and what changes do you notice in flavor as they age? Do you find any coffees peak at a certain day range, or do you prefer to drink them as fresh as possible?

If you’ve brewed any of these coffees below, I’d love to see your recipes! I switch up my methods when my coffee stash gets big, so I’m always looking for new brews to try.

Current lineup:
-Sebastian Ramirez – Watermelon (Colombia | Co-ferment) – Watermelon candy, peach rings, lemon cookie, black tea

-The Juice – Everyday Filter (Honduras, Ethiopia, Brazil | Natural + Washed) – Blood orange, cotton candy, peach jam

A year ago? I legit *dreaded* walking into my kitchen.

Not because it was haunted (though the expired yogurt in the back of the fridge might disagree)…  
But because it felt like a to-do list with cabinets.

Open the fridge? (Sigh.) 
Think about cooking? (Groan.)  
9 PM snack raid? (…Hello, entire sleeve of crackers.)

I didn’t need a kitchen makeover. I didn’t need The Home Edit to come bless my pantry with rainbow bins (bless them, though).  
I just needed to stop treating my kitchen like it was a Michelin-star prep station — and start treating it like… my friend.

So I made 3 stupid-simple, lazy-girl-approved changes.

No willpower required. No 5 AM kale chopping. No “wellness influencer” nonsense.

Just… peace. And snacks.

🍏 Change 1: The “One Shelf to Rule Them All” 
I picked ONE shelf in my fridge — middle height, eye-level, no squatting required — and declared it: **The Easy Win Zone**.

Only things that take <2 minutes to eat live here.  
Hard-boiled eggs I bought pre-peeled .  
Baby spinach in a clamshell (just dump it in a bowl).  
Single-serve yogurts. String cheese. Apples. Cold rotisserie chicken (no shame).

Tired? Stressed? Hangry and about to yell at your partner for breathing too loud?  
Go to The Shelf. Grab. Eat. Win.

No decisions. No chopping. No guilt.

🍫 Change 2: The “No Guilt Snack Bowl” (aka The Anti-Diet Dish 
I put a $7 ceramic bowl from Target on my counter.  
In it? Three things I *actually* want to eat:  
→ Dark chocolate squares (the fancy kind with sea salt)  
→ Roasted almonds (lightly salted, obviously)  
→ Dried mango (the chewy, sugary, tastes-like-candy kind)

Rule? There is no rule.  
Want one? Take one. Want three? Take three.  
No tracking. No “you’ve used your snack budget.”  
It’s *always* there. No gatekeeping. No drama.

And guess what?  
I started eating *less* junk food.  
Because when I’m not “being bad,” I’m not rebelling.  
Turns out, freedom > restriction. Who knew?

🧹 Change 3: The “5-Minute Mercy Clean”**  
After I eat (ANYTHING), even if it’s just standing over the sink eating peanut butter with a spoon .I give my kitchen 5 minutes of mercy.

Wipe the counter.  
Toss the napkin.  
Put the dish in the dishwasher.  
That’s it.

I don’t deep clean. I don’t reorganize the spice rack. I don’t become Martha Stewart.  
I just… reset.

And waking up to a kitchen that doesn’t look like a raccoon threw a party?  
(Chef’s kiss.) 
It feels like Past Me gave Future Me a hug. And maybe a coffee.

Look. I’m not a chef. I’m not a minimalist. I still own a spatula with dried egg on it from 2022 (we’re in a committed relationship).

But I finally stopped trying to be “perfect” — and started being ""kind"" to myself.
My kitchen isn’t Instagram-ready.  
But it’s *me*-,ready.  
And that’s the whole damn point.

👇YOUR TURN:

My husband found out I spent our kids' college fund on my affair partner's business and now my entire family has disowned me, but I still think I was investing in our future.

I know how that sounds. Just hear me out.

Three years ago, I met someone at my book club. He was charming, successful, ran his own consulting firm. My husband and I had been married fifteen years, and things were stale. You know how it is. Same conversations, same routines, same everything.

The affair started slowly. Coffee after book club turned into lunches, then hotel rooms. I told myself it was just physical, just something to feel alive again. My husband worked long hours at the hospital. He never noticed when I came home late or bought new clothes.

Six months in, my affair partner mentioned his business was struggling. He needed an investor or he'd have to shut down. He showed me projections, profit margins, growth potential. It looked legitimate. And I thought, if we ended up together, this would be our future income.

Our twins' college accounts had almost $180,000 saved. My husband had been putting money away since they were born. I had access as a joint account holder.

I took it all.

""It's an investment,"" I told myself. ""The returns will triple the money before the kids graduate high school.""

I didn't tell my husband. Why would I? He'd never understand. He was always so conservative with money, so afraid of taking risks.

For a year, everything seemed fine. My affair partner showed me quarterly reports, talked about expansion, new clients. The kids were only sophomores. We had time.

Then last month, my husband got a statement in the mail. The college funds were empty.

""There must be a mistake,"" he said, calling the bank. But there wasn't.

He confronted me that night after the kids went to bed. ""Where is our children's money?""

I tried to lie at first, said I moved it to a higher yield account. But he kept pushing, kept asking for details. Finally, I broke.

""I invested it.""

""In what?""

""A business opportunity.""

""Whose business?""

Silence.

""Whose business?"" His voice was so quiet.

""Someone I know from book club.""

He stared at me. Just stared. Then he went to our computer and started pulling up bank records, credit card statements, everything. He's thorough like that. Methodical. It's what makes him a good surgeon.

By morning, he knew everything. The affair, the money, all of it.

""You stole from our children,"" he said. ""For your affair partner.""

""It's an investment! We'll make it back!""

""Call him. Right now. Get our money back.""

I called. He didn't answer. I texted. Nothing. I drove to his office. It was empty. The whole suite, cleared out.

I hired a lawyer, tried to track him down. Turns out his consulting firm never existed. The reports were fake. Even his name was fake.

My husband filed for divorce immediately. Told both our families everything. My parents were horrified. My sister said I'm dead to her. His family, who'd always treated me like a daughter, won't even look at me.

The twins found out. Of course they did. They're seventeen, not stupid. My daughter won't speak to me. My son asked if I ever loved them.

""Of course I love you,"" I said.

""But not enough to keep our college money safe,"" he replied.

The divorce was final last week. I got nothing. Judge said I'd shown financial irresponsibility and breach of fiduciary duty. My husband got the house, primary custody, everything.

I'm living with a coworker now, sleeping on her couch. I work two jobs to pay my lawyer fees. Every penny I save goes toward trying to rebuild college funds, but at $400 a month, I'll never make it back in time.

My husband remarried already. His new wife is a pediatrician he met at the hospital. The kids love her. She helped them apply for scholarships and financial aid. They both got into good schools despite everything.

Last week was parents' weekend at my daughter's college. I wasn't invited. Saw the photos on social media, though. My husband, his new wife, and my kids, all smiling at dinner.

Someone commented, ""Beautiful family!""

My daughter replied, ""I'm lucky to have parents who put me first.""

Parents. Plural. Not including me.

I still check my affair partner's fake social media sometimes. Still Google his fake name. Still dream that he'll come back with the money and an explanation.

Pathetic, right?

But here's the thing. I know I messed up. I know I destroyed my family. I know I stole from my kids. But part of me still thinks that if the investment had worked out, if he'd been real, everyone would have eventually seen I was trying to build something better for all of us.

I used to have back-to-back meetings all day, every day. My calendar used to look like Tetris (colors included), and I was proud of it in some ways.

But then I realized something, my best ideas never came during those meetings. They came when I was walking to get coffee, or waiting for my cab, or doing dishes.

Turned out there's science behind this. Our brains have limited mental energy, and running it the whole day is a sure shot way to burn ourselves out. Creativity seems to happen when our mind is relaxed and unfocused, not when we're grinding through our fifth Zoom call.

So I started scheduling buffer blocks - 15-30 minute pockets of doing nothing between intense work sessions. Not for catching up on email or scrolling my phone, but doing nothing - sitting quietly or just taking a walk (for me, both work a bit better if I can get to a green place).

No agenda, no productivity hacks. No strategising. Just space.

The results? I started coming back to my tasks refreshed, rather than depleted. I could generally solve problems faster. One very interesting side effect was that my 3 PM brain fog disappeared. Those creative breakthroughs I used to only get in the shower? They began happening throughout the day.

**Who I’m looking for:**

* around my age, so 25-30
* located somewhere in Europe
* someone who accepts and respects my boundaries as ace, and is fine going without getting any, so a very low drive, or maybe you’re ace too
* doesn't want children
* knows what he wants, emotionally intelligent, honest and funny
* someone I can have deep conversations with but also goof around

**About me:**

* 27 years old (1998)
* born and raised in Finland
* atheist and a progressive person with liberal views (leftie, feminist, pro-choice, woke, you know the drift)
* childfree
* chubby and short (160cm), some small tattoos but I dream of a full sleeve
* short dark brown hair (but I change it up, it’s been green, blue, purple etc)

* into fashion, photography, k-pop, anime, writing, reading, city holidays
* not athletic or outdoorsy lol
* sadly deadly allergic to pets :(

I loaded up my in-progress science fiction themed park.  I like playing in sandbox mode where you actually have to earn money, manage and build up the park over time, do research, etc.  So basically park management style gameplay.

I opened my park and realized that where I left off was that I had just finished building a rollercoaster that was... not very good.  It was too big and expensive, it's scores were not very good, and so it wasn't drawing in many visitors to the park.  I really was not in the mood to redesign my coaster.  I wanted to plop something down.  So I figured I'd delete my poor coaster and find a good blueprint someone had designed.  Well, that didn't work well.  Even if you search for coasters with science fiction theming... you get LOTS of results that don't make any sense, and tags don't work right.

For example, I search for ""science fiction coaster"" and the third search result is a coffee shop someone built.  I click ""Chain Lift"" as a filter, and the third search result is a unicorn statue that isn't even a coaster.  How is a unicorn station ""chain lift""?

The other thing I don't like is that there is no COST filter.  A lot of the blueprints in the workshop are only good if you're playing in sandbox mode with no money.  Some of these huge blueprints are massively expensive in-game if you're playing the game as a park simulator.  So the designs just aren't practical to use.  There's no way to know that when searching though, other than subscribing to it and looking at the cost when you try to plop it down.

I didn't want to spend time designing a coaster.  The in-game blueprints available were not good.  Searching for blueprints to download from others was frustrating.  I decided to just quit the game and do something else.",4,1757603827.0,PlanetCoaster,2,1.0,False

But over time I noticed my energy dipping hard by the afternoons. Id get restless, keep shifting in my seat, and by the end of the day I was mentally fried. Eventually I realized my environment was working against me more than my actual habits. So I made a couple small changes, I finally upgraded to an ergonomic chair from green soul since it had lumbar support and it was overpriced, added warmer lighting, and decluttered to make the space feel a bit cozier. Tbh those tweaks made a bigger difference to my focus than any new app or life hack I tried.  
Its funny how we chase complex systems when sometimes the biggest boost comes from fixing the basics. Has anyone else experienced this? Like you change one small thing about your environment and suddenly everything feels easier?",7,1757603269.0,productivity,2,0.89,False

1neb5gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalMarketingHelp/comments/1neb5gb/local_seo_what_it_is_how_it_works_and_why_your/,"Local SEO: What It Is, How It Works, and Why Your Business Needs It","# Does Local SEO Make Sense?

Businesses of all sizes are attempting to increase their online clientele in the cutthroat digital world of today. Local SEO is one of the most effective ways for small businesses and local service providers to differentiate themselves in their community. Is the investment worthwhile, though? Let’s dissect it and address some frequently asked questions.

# Local SEO: What Is It?

Local SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is the process of improving your company’s online visibility so it appears in local search results on Google and other search engines. When someone searches for “best bakery near me” or “plumber in Trivandrum,” Google uses location data to show nearby businesses. The main goal of local SEO is to help your business rank in these searches, especially in the Google Local Pack (map section) and organic results.

Important local SEO tasks include:

*  Improving your Google Business Profile (GBP)
*  Adding location-based keywords to your website
*  Getting positive reviews
*  Listing your business in local directories
*  Creating content that relates to the local area

# Is Local SEO a Good Idea?

* Targets Customers Who Are Prepared to Buy Local searchers often need the service immediately. Studies show that over 75% of local searches lead to a store visit within 24 hours.
* Cost-effective Marketing: Unlike paid ads, local SEO can continue to yield results for months or even years after optimisation.
* Facilitates Competition with Bigger Brands Even if you are a small business, you can outrank well-known companies in your area if you take the right approach.
* Builds Trust: Positive reviews and a thorough Google profile give your business a reliable and polished look.

# How Long Does Local SEO Take?

Local SEO is not an overnight fix—it’s a process. On average, you may start noticing results within 3 to 6 months, depending on factors like:

* Competition in your area and industry
* Current online presence and website strength
* Number of positive reviews and ratings
* Consistency in updating your profile and content
* For highly competitive markets, it can take longer. However, the results are long-lasting compared to short-term ad campaigns.

# To what extent does local SEO work?

* Boosts Visibility: When clients search for your service, your company shows up. 
* Increases Foot Traffic: This is great for restaurants, retail stores, salons, and service providers. 
* Increases Conversions: Among all marketing channels, local searches have some of the highest conversion rates. 
* Improves Online Reputation: You can stand out from the competition and gain people’s trust by using reviews and ratings. For example, a small coffee shop in Trivandrum that is optimized for the phrase “best coffee shop in Trivandrum” may rank among Google’s top 3 map listings, attracting both locals and visitors.  Final judgement: If your business relies on clients in a specific location, local SEO is worth the effort. It generates targeted leads.

# How Does Google’s AI Impact Local SEO Rankings?

Google’s AI has changed how local search works by making results more accurate and personal. Instead of just looking at keywords, AI tools like RankBrain and BERT try to understand what people really mean when they search. For example, if someone types “best coffee near me,” Google uses AI to check location, reviews, and business details to show the most useful results. It also works better with voice searches and mobile searches. This means local businesses that have correct information, good reviews, and helpful content are more likely to appear higher in search results.",1,1757602885.0,DigitalMarketingHelp,1,1.0,False
1neb50q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1neb50q/help_no_idea_how_to_style_my_room/,Help! No idea how to style my room.,"So, usually based on the floor and walls, I generally have an idea of what I want to do. But if the furniture is already bought, then it gets hard. You see, my bedroom furniture is all mixed up.

I think my parents didn't want to spend any more money on buying furniture, because they took apart the bunk bed from our old house (white), and I'm using one bed in my room. Next to it is a huge desk from the attic (warm brown, orange-ish), and its legs are black wood. Two wardrobes that we cannot take out because the previous owners had such a genius idea to fix them in place. They're white. Another shelf I found in the basement, left by previous owners that is hideous, but I tried to cover up the ugly bits- it's a very light shade of wood.

So....all my furniture is just...stuff we found I guess. And my parents don't really want to switch out anything anytime soon, except for the horrid light wood coloured shelf. They don't want to bother spending money on my room, yet they're forcing me to design it. 

I'm lazy, but also because I kinda don't see much hope for the room and am just like....meh. I can't generate ideas. My dad said he'd take me to the furniture store to get those stickers to glue onto furniture to make them have some kind of design. No idea how that's going to pull my room together, but okay.

They just want me to also get a shelf because my desk is a mess and all my books are on it and that ugly shelf does not have much space. Thought of getting a shelf that also is like, on the wall, but no idea if my parents would approve- I could try, since they're so adamant on a new shelf of all things for some reason.

He mentioned someone else wanting my bed- and before you can light up thinking I can get rid of it, no I can't. Because there's no deadline to this. It may even be years and I won't get rid of that stupid bed from a taken-apart bunk bed. I mean, it's been almost more than 2 years since we moved intot his house and even our living room is uncoordinated and empty af. 

  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can read this part for context but even skip it if you like but this is to provide how WONDERFUL my parents designing abilities are (nonexistent):

\- Living room is big but looks super empty and off because again: MISMATCHED FURNITURE. The walls are white, the floor is wood, the curtains cream with gold accents, couch grey with yellow pillows, and the TV table WHITE and looks like those sleek modern minimalism tables or whatever. There's no shelf for our showcase items so everything is just placed on the damn TV table and it's so packed there for no reason. I thought we had a chance of pulling the living room together before they bought the TV table by just placing that big Kashmir-style red mat in the living room and getting a wood TV table and boom thing that looked decent, but NO. They got a TV table completely out of touch- white and sleek modern, matching none of the furniture we have, with a glass and white coffee table. What happened to the mat? OH. They placed it UNDER THE DINING TABLE in the dining room because ''everyone does that'', The carpet's design is barely visible under that wood table. It's in the glasshouse. 

\- went to IKEA. My mom saw pillows for the couch once- yellow and grey. Except they look hideous, like a cat jumped on them and scratched them up. I told her it was ugly and regretted it because she got mad even though she asked for my opinion, only to put them away in the end because our cousin had the same opinion I did.

\- made the entrance spacious by switching shoe racks BUT made that white and minimalism sleek modern whatever that again does not fit the vibe like...what is with the white furniture? I hate that minimalistic all white furniture bro, it's so default and boring and super common and doesn't fit with the rest of our furniture!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Anyway, I was embarrassed by our house, so I put off calling my friends over for a long time. I've been to their houses and they managed to pull together SOMETHING to make it look decent, when it's been over 2+ years for us and our house still looks like...sorry, but like shit in my opinion. I know you might be thinking it's rich coming from someone with no ideas, but I DID have ideas, but they were DISREGARDED and they bought whatever furniture they wanted, so now I have no idea what to do anymore except be a hater. And they say it's my fault for not helping out when I tried to but they ignored me like AGHHHH OMGGGG.

  
Anyway, sorry about that, but like I was saying, I decided I don't give a shit anymore and called my friends over for a sleepover for my birthday. If my house is ugly, I will encourage them to say so, so that I can tell my parents, and they will finally feel embarrassed and feel compelled to finally do something. 2 years and nothing but ugliness is crazy bro, like my friend switched houses a year or so after us and they managed to pull something decent together in their living room- it's embarrassing. Mind you, we got our TV table 1 and a half years later, and up until then, our TV table was a half-broken wooden drawer we found in the attic covered up by a picnic cloth cause of how ugly it was. I wanted to faint right there when I saw that monstrosity. 

 I know I'm being dramatic and went off board, but I'm so tired. My friends will come over in 2-3 weeks. Any design ideas I can quickly use to fix up at least my room to make it look decent enough despite the mismatched furniture? I can send pics of my roomifs needed. Is it possible to send pics on an already posted post?

Thank you so so much.

After this, I stab around with a WDT tool, use a leveller to level it, tamp it hard once and put a puck screen on top.

It’s a tiny studio, cheap, close to work and the city yet nestled enough into a little pocket of middle-of-nowhere that makes it feel almost magical. I am just walking distance to stores and parks. It’s a quiet town. I lived there before the pandemic. I’m coming home.

I’m so excited i could cry. I desperately miss living alone, and crave it immensely. I feel like i’ve finally fought so hard and gotten what I am fighting for. I’m so excited to have my own little corner of the own again that I can call my own:

I understand that not everyone likes living alone. There’s been an influx of posts on here lately from people griping about it. But I truly am so grateful for the quiet solitude, the peace, and the immense sense of SELF that comes with living by myself, especially after surviving so much trauma.

I am almost free again. I move in Oct 1st and am already looking forward to the smell of coffee in the morning, opening my windows to the sound of morning birds, seeing the sunsets  spill in through curtains. I am so ready! 

The world is absolutely insane lately. It seemingly only gets worse. Having my own little peaceful place is the only goal that feels tangible enough to keep me sane. I feel like a major milestone in my life is finally coming into fruition! ",9,1757602601.0,LivingAlone,2,1.0,False

if i pull back and don’t go to her, she’ll do things like take bathroom breaks/ coffee breaks at the same time as me til she runs into me, linger in the parking lot, etc. i always compliment her, call her pretty, tell her how smart she is. she’s called me sweet, cute on the occasion. 

for me, everything feels very charged. eye contact, giggling, lingering in conversations. sometimes i can’t even explain. the only issue is that i have no idea if it’s completely one sided. she’s very warm to me, i just don’t know the extent of it in her mind. i don’t want to be delusional, and she’s a hard woman to read. 

Ladies, what does this seem like to you?


ps just to clarify — i have no intention of going into a full blown romantic relationship at work. more so just trying to get a read on this situation!

1neb00f,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedForYou/comments/1neb00f/showcase_tide_purclean_detergent_is_it_really/,Showcase Tide Purclean Detergent Is It Really That Effective,"Tide Purclean Liquid Laundry Detergent, model 30772120682, has been a surprising addition to my laundry routine. I wanted to delve into whether this eco-friendly choice truly lives up to its claims of delivering exceptional cleaning power while being gentle on the environment. After weeks of testing, I'd say it’s effective, though there are nuances to consider.

**Scent: A Subtle and Refreshing Experience**  
One of the first things I noticed was the honey lavender scent. Unlike some detergents with overwhelmingly strong aromas, this one hits the sweet spot. It’s light, fresh, and lingers just enough to give your clothes a clean vibe. My kids loved the way their clothes smelled after wash day, and trust me, they’re picky about scents. Although it’s subtle, the fragrance might not last as long on heavily soiled items, but for general laundry, it was perfect.

**Cleaning Performance: Power Meets Gentleness**  
I was initially skeptical about whether this eco-conscious detergent could handle stubborn stains, but I was pleasantly surprised. Muddy socks, coffee spills, and grease marks from my husband’s work clothes came out clean after running a standard wash cycle. Tide’s trusted cleaning power shines through even in cold water, which is excellent for energy savings. However, those with extremely tough stains might need to pre-treat or double-wash in rare cases.

**Key Benefits**  
- Light and pleasant honey lavender scent.  
- Suitable for both HE and regular washing machines.  
- Effective stain removal, even in cold water.  
- Free of dyes, making it suitable for sensitive skin.  

[Don’t miss Tide 30772120682 deals—check Amazon here.](https://reviews.sanue.com/p/b0cq3d1hk7/)

**Eco-Friendly Appeal**  
What sets this detergent apart is its EPA Safer Choice certification. Products with this label aim to combine excellent performance with a more sustainable approach, and Tide Purclean falls in line with that mission. The absence of dyes was another big plus for me, as some family members have sensitive skin. I didn’t notice any irritation, even after washing bedsheets and towels. While it’s reassuring to know the product is environmentally forward, you might find limited information about the deeper breakdown of its components.

**Liquid Formula and Packaging Details**  
The consistency of the detergent makes it easy to measure and pour, although I found the 63 fl oz size slightly bulky. At 4.5 pounds, its packaging feels sturdy but not the most ergonomic for daily use. A pump dispenser might have made life a bit easier, especially when you're in a rush. Still, the packaging reliably prevents leaks during storage, which has been an issue with other brands I’ve used.

**Hurdles**  
- Scent may not linger on very tough fabrics.  
- Packaging could be more user-friendly.  
- Heavily soiled items might need pre-treatment to achieve optimal results.  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve tested a few alternatives, like Seventh Generation and Gain Botanicals, which also cater to eco-friendly households. Compared to Seventh Generation, Tide certainly excels in stain removal, though it slightly lags in terms of ingredient transparency. Gain Botanicals competes strongly on scent longevity but lacks the same cleaning strength when tackling heavily stained items. Overall, Tide holds its ground by being environmentally minded without compromising on performance, making it a standout contender in its category.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
In terms of value, the detergent feels well-priced for what it offers. While some may argue that eco-friendly products could be more affordable, the quality and cleaning power you’re getting justifies the cost. I’ve used cheaper detergents before, only to end up rewashing clothes multiple times. This saved me time and water in the long run, which adds to its financial appeal.

This lead to her doubting her ability as the Desolation’s Messiah, and she ordered her cult to hang her so that when she died her power could return to the Lightless Flame instead of fizzling out when the ritual failed.

1neaxtg,https://i.redd.it/kltv1fq8ujof1.jpeg,Women safety: Freedom should not have a curfew.,"We don’t think twice before stepping out late at night. A quick walk, a coffee run or just fresh air. But for millions of women in India, the decision isn’t that simple.

“Is it safe?”
“Should I call someone to walk with me?”
“Maybe I’ll wait until morning.”

These are not just passing thoughts — they’re daily restrictions that limit freedom.

The truth is: safety is not a privilege, it’s a right. Women should feel secure enough to step outside whenever they want, whether it’s 5 PM, 11 PM or 3 AM.

Yet today, gated communities, remote neighborhoods and even busy city streets often fail to provide that sense of security. Crimes still happen because cameras are passive, guards are reactive and systems work in silos.

At Triye, we believe technology can change this. By turning ordinary CCTV cameras into an intelligent, unified safety net, our AI can detect unusual behavior, track suspects across cameras and alert authorities instantly.

Because protecting women is not about telling them when to go out, it’s about ensuring they can go out anytime.

👉 To the women reading this: You deserve to walk freely.
👉 To the communities reading this: Safety must be proactive, not reactive.

What do you think is the biggest barrier to women’s safety at night — lack of tech, lack of enforcement or mindset?

Let’s talk. 💬

The stock pulled back a bit to around $1.87, but I think this is a good sign, not a bad one. It looks like a normal ""coffee break"" after a big jump, which often happens before a stock moves higher.  

The company's business is strong. They're making more money this year than they did all of last year, their wireless charging is moving forward, and their AI software is getting bigger. The people who work at the company own about 80% of the stock, and big investment groups have bought a lot more shares recently (up almost 178%). The number of shares that can be traded is also low (around 25 million).  

This all points to more growth ahead. These small dips can get people to sell if they're not confident, but it just reloads for the next move up. What do you think? Could we see it hit $2.30 next?

As there are some things which are surprising and good to have in advance and despite my best efforts at being organised, I didn't.

**An actual nappy changing bag** \- I'm a thrifty person and thought, well we can just use one of our tote bags / backpacks. WRONG. You will end up with many nappy bags and wipes spread across all of your 20 totes and bags because they all look the same and your brain will not have the energy to figure out which one has all the nappies, spare clothes, etc in it.

**Yoga ball** \- Yoga ball was good for when I was pregnant. but for baby-times? indespensible. We bounce her on this three times a day, every day, and then at night, in the night. You have no idea how helpfult his is!

**Magic wireless smart plugs for your homes' lights -** cannot stress enought how nice it is to sit down with baby, go upstairs with baby, etc, and be able to turn lights on or off using your phone! Get them set up and configured before baby comes.

**Giant fake Stanley cup** \- Mine was £5 from Aldi. Now I've stopped breastfeeding I barely use it but throughout pregnancy and early days I was chugging squash at a frankly shocking rate. Get one.

**Puppy pads, then washable absorbent waterproof changing mat liners** \- You will change your baby on their changing mat a lot of the time. A lot of the other times you'll do it on your couch or bed and they're going to pee all over everything, so you'll want a proper absorbent pad under them (the urine will run straight off a waterproof changing mat). We used puppy pads [but these kind of guys are 100% worth getting, trust me. ](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Waterproof-Changing-Quilted-Friendly-Absorbent/dp/B085H8MDW3/ref=sr_1_6_pp?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.GBG6zCXA02tYmIHnuWIcHD5hlNTk8yYi0h50hFeZaEMp6z95VRgiPKMegeV1TC6jgvQhdNj7h4BpvCqGyRUoX8zxoQK66sT3_OtO0F0QN0y5SR4seUz6sH6Nr01td8agQCP1T_Eg96Wmdlf0Ei4_nYlCQmnigY0dERBVnac1xvjbGz_QO9kGwRMNC1L-EEr9PX6svLzeZ5mmBTrGIKJDxSkjRa0sKDC16cBFVC1FJcYWjDg6b_op15tAa1NA28C3KLAlGUaho4r5Qro_3OXyvI5Gq2BQBiWyk56rMKDUzRo.wtnDxlNZdFK7UpKiwhXkIc5MHxdSgN3eCKwcqHwhieE&dib_tag=se&keywords=changing+mat+covers&qid=1757601675&sr=8-6)

**Nuby Rapid Cool for formula-users** \- We did combi from birth (despite our plans to EBF). If you plan on having any bottles, get the Nuby Rapid Cool early. It is amazing, and you can take it out with you, and it only costs £35.

**Baby Moov pod pillow or similar** \- Got this for free. We didn't let her sleep in it, but it was a vital thing for leaving her in on the sofa, floor, in her baby gym, etc.

**Baby Bjorn bouncer** \- It's true what they say. It is GREAT and much better than other bouncers. It kept her safely contained for a really long time. Wish I'd had it sooner. We don't need it much now but we put her in it and bounced her with our foot for hours at a time, and brought it all over the country with us. PS if anyone's looking to buy one I'm selling it, it's fab, hah.

**Fabric sling, then a proper baby carrier** \- Get a stretchy fabric wrap sling for when they are tiny newborns. You won't really be using your Tula or fancy carrier when they're dinkywinky.  And learn how to tie your sling now! it's a lot harder when you're fucking shattered with a baby on you.

**A GOOD BREAST PUMP** \- Okay, I realise this is against most advice, so maybe you cn hold fire for a little bit until you see how the chips fall, but man, I wish I'd had a good breast pump from birth instead of a meh manual one, because my milk did not come in properly and this would have made a big difference. Make sure you get one that does both boobs at the same time, single breast pumps are a sham because you end up spending 40 minutes pumping instead of 20 and doing both. I would have paid much more than I did to have one that actually stopped my supply from being perma-low. Wish I'd done this.

**Whatever app / games you like** \- Yes, you can spend £10 to unlock the full version of Peggle or get a [Chess.com](http://Chess.com) subscription. You'll be using your phone about 20 hours a day if you're anything like me, so indulge yourself. See also: extremely nice coffee.

Edit: **The Love2Dream arms up swaddle** was a gamechanger. I just got it for cheap off Vinted because I didn't think she'd like it but she really did (after hating normal swaddle.)

Final tip: If you feel your wrist start to agitate at you, don't ignore this, it's called ""mother's wrist"" and it can debilitate you. Get wrist warmers. Do stretches. Dooooon't ignore it or my christ you will regret it.

We had a fight over the phone, and there was a coldness in his voice that still reverberates in my ears, I can't tolerate your insecurity and clinginess anymore.I woke up the next morning as if someone had snatched my whole world away. Blocked me from everywhere. WhatsApp, Insta, even deleted the shared playlist on Spotify, which had so many of our memories. It felt as if I was never in his life, as if I was a ghost that he had pushed away. The first month was just a series of mistakes. I would type a message in the middle of the night, send it, and then delete it the very next moment, like a stupid child would do. I would stand outside his office for hours, hoping that maybe he would come out and talk to me. I would message his friends, asking them for updates about him, and then later I would curse myself for how I had stooped so low. The more I ran after him, the more he went away from me, as if I was a curse.

 The worst was the day I saw him laughing with another girl at a party. My heart dropped. I went to the washroom and was panting while crying, as if I was out of breath. My hands were shaking, and all I could think was, Maybe he will never be mine, maybe I will never be enough for anyone."" Coming home that night, I decided that I will either pull myself out of this pain, or I will be drowned in this darkness forever. Life after that was not easy, not at all. I took therapy. For the first time I told the therapist, Yes, I am jealous. Yes, I am afraid that he will leave me. And that fear eventually came true.
I joined the gym. On the first day, I could not run on the treadmill for even five minutes, but I kept going every day., so that I could sweat out the anger and pain, as if I was turning my weakness into strength. I called old friends, whom I had not spoken to in years, and tried to find myself again.  And yes, I also took up rock climbin because I had to prove to myself over and over again that I could fall, get badly broken, and still get back up as life would test me by making me fall again and again.

For 5 months, I had no contact with him. No texts, no stalking, no nothing. It wasn’t easy, not at all. I typed his name into my phone at 3 am, then forced myself to stop, like I was battling an addiction. I even installed an app so I wouldn’t drunkenly text him, like my very existence was at stake. 7 months later, his first text came Hey, how are you? My heart started pounding, like it was going to burst out of my chest, but I didn’t reply right away, as if to prove myself. The next day I casually texted, “Are you okay?” and from there, we started talking casually, like two strangers meeting again.

 When he called me for coffee for the first time, there was a clear surprise in his eyes, as if he could not recognize me. As if he was thinking, ""Is this the same girl who used to cry all the time? How did she become so calm?The truth was that I was the same only now I had learnt to live for myself, as if I had taken the reins of my life in my own hands.

Slowly we started meeting again. And yes, I dated someone else in the meantime, as if I had freed myself. The difference was that this time I was not desperate, nor dependent on anyone. When he said two weeks ago, ""Can we try again?"" my answer was yes, but that yes was not out of fear, but of my own free will, as if I had taken my own decision. Now we are together again, moving forward slowly, like two strangers finding a new path. But jealousy no longer controls me, as if I have overcome my demons.  Because this time I have worked on myself, learned to love myself. He sees it too, and appreciates it, as if he has realized my true worth. But to be honest? My real victory was not that he came back. My real victory was that I came backto myself, to my existence, to my strength.

Not; Sorry if my English is broken. I’m writing first in my own language and then translating it. My goal is not perfect grammar, but to tell my real story",14,1757601776.0,Life,7,0.82,False

I am about to start work in the city centre and wondered what are the best:

A) coffee shops! Ideally one that does a subscription per month. I know Leon has one however I dont think the station store is valid for this. I have also seen 92 degrees have one but not sure how good their coffee is?

B) Gym! Ideally one in city centre. I have heard things about pure gym north, I presume it will be busy after work at around 5ish? I also have heard about Nuffield however probably won't be able to afford 60£/month for a subscription.

Skin tone is somewhere between cinnamon and copper, eyes are dark brown like freshly brewed coffee, body is slender like a mediterranean cypress tree, lips are naturally plump like black cherries kissed by the summer sun, neck is un cou de crayon, and last but not least, legs for days if you’re into that🤭

Okay, now you can stop daydreaming and get to the real stuff haha

**Here’s a bit about me:**
I have a pretty good career life and have worked in different sectors including energy and neuroscience. I lean more towards being an introvert, but find it very easy to connect with people from all walks of life. I’m a little witty, and love a good stimulating conversation, but also love to laugh until my cheeks hurt. My hobbies include baking, hiking, going to art galleries, f1, travel, languages, karaoke (can’t sing to save my life), volunteering, and the list could go on. I’m a devout Christian and my faith is a big part of my life as I continue to grow in my relationship with Christ. I’m great at communicating (I’m not talking about yapping), and I’m often described as soft and feminine by strangers and friends alike :)

**Here is what I’m looking for:**
- Someone between 25 and 35, who is an active Christian, and wants to have a family in the future
- Stable, ambitious and driven, with the desire to have a partner that supports their goals
- Emotionally mature, and able to communicate their wants and needs because that’s something we should both strive to do (not drawn to nonchalant men)
- Bonus points if you’re a nerd because intelligence is extremely attractive imo!

Open to all ethnicities

I am open to long distance earlier on, with a plan to close the gap. Glad to exchange photos to test mutual attraction. I am *NOT* interested in casual hookups, penpals, extended talking stages, or anything that is not aligned with a LTR leading to marriage

1neaco9,https://i.redd.it/hj99in8pnjof1.jpeg,10-day water fast – My diary (super short version),"I recently finished a **10-day water fast**, and this time I kept a running diary, a really short one.

# New ideas for this fast

* I don’t have much extra weight, so my focus was on the **general health benefits** of fasting and solidifying my habits.
* I picked warm summer days - and wow, fasting in the heat turned out to be a great idea (except for one brutally stressful day 7).
* I tried to keep my daily routine as normal as possible instead of lying around. The goal was to accomplish as much as possible while fasting, and it turned out really well.
* Another thing - I tried to make fasting not the main event. I distracted myself with bigger goals so I wasn’t obsessing over food all the time - another thing that helped a lot.

# Preparation: Days -2 and -1

* **Day -2:** Hosted a BBQ with friends. I intentionally overate to “build hate” toward food. Odd strategy, but it worked surprisingly well.
* **Day -1:** Played soccer and kept meals light.

# Day 1 – Monday

* Slept great — I was super excited to start my fast.
* Coffee with heavy cream at 7 am, and my fast officially began.
* Did a **DEXA scan** right after starting; those results are always a huge motivator.
* It was also my **18th wedding anniversary**. My wife wasn’t exactly thrilled to celebrate with just water, but hey, love is about compromise.
* To speed up ketosis (and avoid the dreaded day 3 crash), I went all-in at the gym: cycling (11 mins, level 12), running (35 mins at 7 mph), steam room — burned  about 720 calories.
* My staples: Ultima electrolytes (2–3 packets/day), hot water with pink salt, and San Pellegrino (one 750 ml bottle).

# Day 2 – Tuesday

* First calf cramps — gone after electrolytes.
* Gym: cycling (10 mins), strength training (40 mins at \~60% load), steam room.
* Kept reminding myself: this fast isn’t about “surviving.” It’s about using 10 days to actually **get stuff done**.

# Day 3 – Wednesday

* Slept unbelievably deep — so deep it was hard to wake up. Probably from cutting coffee (black coffee tastes awful to me).
* Realization: fasting in **summer is way nicer than winter**, even in California.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (35 mins at 6 mph), steam room.
* Eyes started feeling tired quickly, slight vision deterioration.

# Day 4 – Thursday

* More calf cramps.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), strength training (35 mins), steam room.
* First tiny bowel movement since starting the fast.

# Day 5 – Friday

* Resting heart rate dropped to **41**, impressive. My all time low was 38, but it was like 10 years ago.
* Big realization: poor sleep during my previous fasts wasn’t from physical stress, but **mental stress about fasting itself**. This time, I felt relaxed, slept well, and that made fasting much easier during the daytime.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (20 mins at 5.4 mph), steam room.

# Day 6 – Saturday

* Night heart rate: 42. Another great night of sleep.
* No workouts — spent the day at my son’s soccer tournament in **95°F heat**. Brutal.
* Eyes irritated from the dry air, even with glasses. Felt drained all day.

# Day 7 – Sunday

* Morning calf cramps again — fixed with electrolytes.
* **The hardest day**: another full day at my son’s tournament in 95°F. My glucose dropped to 41 (quickly rebounded to 60). Ketones hit **7.4**, my all-time high at that time.
* Just to stress me out further, I read a Reddit post about someone ending up in the ER with gallbladder issues during fasting. Exactly what I didn’t need to read.
* Eyes still irritated.
* Pool time with my family saved the day — cooling down helped a lot.

# Day 8 – Monday

* Morning cramps again; electrolytes did their job, but only partially.
* Eyes still itchy, but eye drops helped.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (15 mins at 5.2 mph). Energy was definitely low.
* Another tiny bowel movement.
* Ultima electrolytes officially became disgusting — every flavor.

# Day 9 – Tuesday

* Morning cramps again, this time not fully gone with electrolytes.
* Took it easy — my ketones were still at **7.9** in the morning.

# Day 10 – Wednesday

* Same morning cramps.
* Gym: cycling (11 mins), running (20 mins at 5.2 mph), steam room.

# Refeed: Day 1 – Thursday

* Morning cramps again. Electrolytes, again.
* Did a **DEXA scan, full blood panel, and epigenetic clock**. Then I was ready to break my longest fast so far.
* Broke the fast with **boiled broccoli and bone broth**. Oh, those wild broccolli-and-bone-broth post-fast parties!
* Actually, I was a bit nervous about starting to eat again — it felt unusual at first, but the feeling passed quickly.
* Later: coffee with heavy cream (finally!) and more broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and a little cheese. Felt amazing.

# Refeed: Day 2 – Friday

* Cramps still hanging around.
* First real bowel movement — volume, timing, everything felt back to normal.
* Eyes improved noticeably.
* Eating almost normally but chewing every bite very carefully.

# Refeed: Day 3 – Saturday

* Eating close to normal.
* In the evening, went to a party. Sampled a bit of everything (classic Eastern European potluck where everyone brings enough food for 20 people) and even had a little beer. Felt great.

# Refeed: Day 4 – Sunday

* Back to regular food intake. Zero sugar cravings, which is always a win.
* First strength workout post-fast — kept it light to avoid injuries.

# Refeed: Day 5 – Monday

* Regular cardio: cycling (10 mins, level 12), running (30 mins up to 8 mph), steam room.
* Officially done with “careful monitoring.” Back to normal eating and training!

# Summary & Takeaways

* **Easiest fast I’ve ever done** — mentally and physically.
* **Most efficient refeed** I’ve had — the transition back to food was smooth.
* Lost **15.5 lbs total**, including about **5.5 lbs of fat**.
* Next focus: start building muscles - my new learning frontier!

1neac0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1neac0o/to_encourage_those_in_the_trenches/,To Encourage Those in the Trenches!,"Hi, I got on this subreddit in March last year when a girl I dated for four months broke-up with me.  

She was my dream girl ""on paper"", meaning, everything I wanted in a girl, she had.  She was creative, fun, tactile, internationally-minded, and to me, extremely attractive.  We spoke openly, had fun dates, enjoyed sex, and then suddenly she said she needed space and by the fourth month, completely slow-faded me.

For context, I had come out of a ten year relationship before that (my decision) and dated another lady for five months.  But I had no idea this was coming. 

For the first time in my life, I started having anxiety attacks and was depressed for a long period.  The first three months were extremely difficult.  I would think of her when I use my phone, went on Instagram, saw things that reminded me of her.   

Things really got better 9 months in.  And in June this year I started dating someone new.  After 3.5 months, the pattern repeated itself - this new lady ghosted me / slow-faded.  But this time, whilst I was disappointed and upset, I was able to take the blow relatively well.  I was a little temperamental for two weeks then moved on.

For those in the trenches - you can make it.  Everyone's situation is different but there is some science behind recovery.  I don't come to this subreddit much but thought I'll leave a note.  

These were the things which helped me:

\- deleting her pictures and all things which reminded me of her. (I do still have her number.)  The science is that for a period, your brain formed pathways which linked your thoughts to him/her.  The brain can change but you have to change it by creating new pathways and letting old ones die.  I did not, but apparently learning a new language or skill helps.

\- I watched my dopamine levels very closely:  I took cold showers, took coffee, dark chocolate, went for walks in nature.

\- I made it a point to invest in friendship:  this got my oxytocin, dopamine and general happiness up. And I'm so happy to say I have a group of 10 close friends (in different circles), and these friendships would not have deepened if I didn't take the time to ask them out, host them for dinner, watch films with them, etc.

\- Therapy:  this helped me made sense of my issues, seeing a lot of it as brain science and to stop blaming myself and spiralling. 

\- Meditation:  this, to me, was the game changer. It was difficult to sit in silence but I now do it 20 minutes every other day.  Not as hardcore as some, but it gives me calm and helps me to regulate my emotions and separate my thoughts from myself.  I am now my conscious of what I am doing and what I am feeling and not just reacting based on instinct.

It was a tough fall and I consulted this page every other day to read stories of hope.  There is hope.  I haven't found a new partner but that's ok - I'm in a good place and more important, a lot more stable and able to self-regulate.

Hang in there and I wish you all nothing but the best!

(This Can’t Be Real… Right?!),"Okay, is it just me, or is anyone else SHOCKED by how easy it was to make $100 in a week?? No, seriously – this is not clickbait, and I’m NOT an app testing pro (or a techie at all). I stumbled across **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** and I still don’t really get how it all happened so fast.

I mean, at first, I honestly thought those “test apps and earn money” ads were pure scams. 😂 Like, who hasn’t seen those cringe-y popups? But last week, out of sheer boredom (watching YouTube shorts until my eyes DROOLED), I gave in and clicked. Not expecting anything at all. ***ZERO***.

Here’s literally what blew my mind:

- Signed up on **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** in like three minutes with my beat-up, old phone  
- Got my first list of apps to try before I’d even finished my iced coffee  
- All I had to do was download, play, and then leave quick feedback  
- Some apps wanted screenshots, a couple just wanted a rating, and that was IT  
- Every single test? Like 3 to 7 minutes max – I did most of them on the COUCH  
- Payouts straight to PayPal (no sketchy gift cards, no points to convert, ACTUAL cash!)  

I saw my balance stutter upward every night. By Day 4 I was at $56. By the end of Day 7, my total payout was/is $103!! Not flexing, just genuinely confused at why no one else is talking about this yet.

And, can I just say – it’s also kinda fun? One game was this bizarre llama racing sim?? I was CRACKING up at the animation but still left my review like a pro. Another app was for meditation and genuinely calmed my nervy brain.

Why am I telling you? Because if I almost scrolled past **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**, maybe you will too, and holy heck do NOT do that. If you’ve got:

- Spare time on the bus/train/while Netflix “watches you back”  
- Old devices collecting dust  
- Skeptic energy (like me) and want NO up-front costs  
- Or just need gas/coffee/impulse-buy money FAST  

Seriously, give **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** a shot. I'm still checking every morning to see new app listings, and so far? No weird data/grabbing nonsense, no bots calling my mom, and I didn’t have to film a TikTok dance for money.

I still can’t wrap my head around how it’s real, so if anyone wants to try or ALREADY has, I NEED to hear what happened for you. Am I missing something?? Is this the digital side hustle I’ve been dreaming of? Or did I just get weirdly lucky?

Anyway, if your wallet has also been gnawed on by inflation goblins lately, you might as well check out **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**. Let me know if you bank any dollars, or even just have a laugh at my llama racing saga.

From digestion to immunity, these tiny organisms are involved in so many processes that impact your overall wellbeing. And guess what? Coffee contains powerful compounds like antioxidants and natural polyphenols that help feed the good bacteria in your gut, keeping that microbiome balanced and thriving.

In fact, a single cup of our instant coffee contains more antioxidants than a cup of green tea. These antioxidants, along with polyphenols, go to work supporting a healthier gut environment. It’s like giving your gut microbes a little high-five (or a caffeinated hug, if you prefer). The result? A happy gut that helps you feel your best, inside and out.

**The TrueStart Difference: Instant Coffee That’s Good for Your Gut**

At TrueStart, we take gut health seriously – and that’s why our instant coffee is carefully sourced, roasted, and freeze-dried with your wellbeing in mind.

Here’s what makes TrueStart Instant Coffee stand out:

* **Packed with Gut-Loving Goodness**: Our instant coffee is brimming with natural antioxidants and polyphenols that feed healthy gut bacteria. These compounds are preserved through our meticulous production process, ensuring every cup delivers maximum benefits.
* **More Soluble Fibre**: Did you know that our instant coffee contains a touch more soluble fibre than fresh coffee? It’s true! And every little bit helps when it comes to feeding your gut microbes. Fibre acts as food for your good bacteria, helping them to flourish and do their job.
* **No Hidden Nasties**: Unlike some instant coffees on the market, TrueStart is completely clean and free from artificial ingredients or hidden additives. We also lab test our coffee to ensure it’s free from mycotoxins and heavy metals. That means you can sip with confidence, knowing you’re giving your body the very best.
* **Convenience Meets Health**: With TrueStart Instant Coffee, you get all the gut-supporting benefits of a carefully crafted brew in an instant. No faff, no compromise – just pure, delicious coffee that’s good for you and the planet.



**Why TrueStart Instant Coffee Deserves a Spot in Your Routine**

Our instant coffee isn’t just about convenience (though that’s a big win too). It’s about delivering a product that’s packed with flavour, healthy, and most importantly makes you feel amazing!

By choosing a clean, carefully produced instant coffee like TrueStart, you’re ensuring that you’re getting the most out of those incredible gut-loving compounds.

Seriously, my Twitter feed was full of people showing off their fancy workflows while I was still using almost no automation.   
Therefore I started to learn & automate small tasks. 

**My First Attempts Were Messy**

I was using coding tools like [V0 ](https://v0.app/)and [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). They're cool for building stuff, but they didn't solve my daily grunt work. I was still drowning in emails, forgetting meetings, and spending hours on boring tasks.

Then I tried [n8n](https://n8n.io/) . Everyone said it was amazing. And yeah, if you know how to code, you can figure it out. But man, it felt like building a rocket ship just to make toast. Every simple thing needed multiple steps, connections, and constant tweaking when something broke.

I spent more time fixing my automations than actually working.

# What Actually Worked

That's when I discovered prompt-based tools. Instead of connecting boxes and writing code, I could just tell the AI what I wanted in normal English.

I started using [BhindiAI ](https://bhindi.io/)for my daily stuff:

* Sorting through emails and writing replies
* Setting up meetings without the back-and-forth
* Updating my project tasks automatically
* Following up with people who went quiet

For my side projects, Clay AI became a game-changer. It finds potential customers for me and gives me their info plus what to talk to them about. No more spending weekends researching leads.

# Other Tools That Actually Help

Here's what I use now for different things:

**For repetitive computer stuff:** I use [Zapier ](https://zapier.com/)for simple connections (way easier than n8n) and Shortcuts on Mac for things like file organizing and quick calculations.

**For content:** I have ChatGPT write first drafts of emails, social posts, and even help brainstorm project ideas. Notion AI helps me clean up my messy notes.

**For scheduling:** Calendly handles meeting bookings, and I use [Reclaim.ai](http://Reclaim.ai) to automatically block time for focused work.

**For research:** Perplexity is like having a research assistant. I ask it to find information about competitors, market trends, or technical solutions.

**For social media:** Buffer schedules my posts across platforms, and I use Canva's AI to create quick graphics without spending hours in Photoshop.

**What People Get Wrong**

Most people try to automate everything at once. That's backwards.

Start small. Pick one annoying thing you do every day and automate just that. For me, it was email replies. Once that worked, I moved to the next thing.

Also, don't automate broken processes. If something is messy when you do it manually, automation will just make it messier faster.

And honestly? Sometimes the ""automation"" is just using a better tool. I switched from complex project management apps to simple ones that actually work for how my brain operates.

# The Real Change

I'm not saying I never do manual work now. But the difference is huge. I used to start each day with a list of boring tasks. Now I start thinking about what I actually want to build.

My brain isn't constantly interrupted by ""oh, I need to email that person back"" or ""did I update that spreadsheet?"" Those things just happen in the background.

The best part? Most of these tools are either free or cost less than a coffee subscription. You don't need to be a tech wizard or spend thousands on fancy software.

Just start with one annoying task and make it go away. Then move to the next one.",7,1757600787.0,ChatGPT,9,0.77,False
1nea80a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueStartCoffee/comments/1nea80a/how_is_truestart_coffee_actually_different/,How is TrueStart coffee actually different?,"When it comes to instant coffee, we're on a mission to change the game.

Many people have come to expect instant coffee to be quick and convenient but lacking in quality; we’re here to show that it doesn’t have to be that way.

At TrueStart, we’ve crafted an instant coffee that is as good for you as it is delicious.

Let's dive in as to why our instant coffee stand out and why it’s unlike anything else you’ll find in the UK..



What Makes TrueStart Instant Coffee So Unique?**Specialty-Grade Beans for Superior Taste**

Our instant coffee, like all of our coffee, is made from specialty grade beans, and we’re the only Instant Coffee in the UK that we know of to do so.

This means all of our coffee is super high quality and each cup is deliciously smooth with a full-bodied flavour.

**A Natural Powerhouse of Antioxidants**

Did you know that one cup of TrueStart Instant Coffee has more antioxidants than a cup of green tea?

Antioxidants are essential for combating oxidative stress in the body, and our coffee is packed full of them, so each cup gives you a natural boost that’s both good for the mind and the body.

**Rigorously Tested for Mycotoxins and Heavy Metals**

We believe in creating coffee that’s as clean as it is delicious. That’s why we rigorously test all of our coffee to ensure they’re free from mycotoxins and heavy metals.

This dedication to purity means that when you choose TrueStart, you can trust you’re getting a brew that’s both deliciously clean and high-quality.

**Naturally Healthy with Proven Cognitive and Physiological Benefits**

Our Instant Coffee is naturally packed with health benefits that go far beyond a simple caffeine boost. Coffee has been shown to support both cognitive and physiological wellbeing, and we’re proud to offer a coffee that maximises these benefits.

* **Cognitive Benefits:** Coffee can help increase alertness and focus, improve memory, and even elevate mood.
* **Physiological Benefits:** Coffee has been shown to increase metabolism, enhance physical performance, and reduce the risk of certain diseases, including Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, and liver disease. It also delivers powerful antioxidant properties to support overall health.

**Consistent Caffeine for a Reliable Boost Every Time**

With most coffees, you never really know how much caffeine you’re consuming. Imagine pouring a glass of wine and not knowing if it’s 4% or 40%!

That’s the kind of inconsistency you find with caffeine levels in coffee. At TrueStart, we knew we couldn’t be the only ones wanting a reliably caffeinated coffee that would deliver consistent energy without the crashes or jitters.

We spent over a year developing a hyper-selective sourcing process and a rigorous testing protocol to launch the first coffee on the market with a naturally consistent, tested caffeine level.

This means every cup of TrueStart gives you the perfect amount of caffeine for a feel-good boost that lasts, without any unpleasant surprises.

**Freeze-Dried to Lock in Flavour and Health Benefits**

When it comes to Instant Coffee, there are two main types, spray dried and freeze dried. A lot of Instant Coffee’s currently on the market are spray-dried - you’ll be able to recognise spray dried coffee as it looks like a powder rather than shards.

When coffee is spray dried, a lot of the taste and aroma’s are burnt off in the process meaning they have to be added back in afterwards.

Our coffee is freeze-dried locking in and preserving the full flavour and all the natural goodness.

why a power couple: two people who sharpen each other, push each other, laugh through the chaos, and maybe build something bigger than just ourselves. a power couple not in the corporate sense, but in the way two curious people can magnify each other’s energy.

I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",1,1757600454.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

So, it's been a hot topic recently. [A tool](https://x.com/p5x_alert/status/1965019552930222244) by P5X_Alert was recently released that can grab your pull data and show you your history in a more meaningful presentation. In fact you can have it be displayed in [Lufel.net](https://lufel.net/pull-tracker/?lang=en&v=2.6.6).

The current data is trending is suggesting soft pity isn't implemented in Global. For those unaware **Soft Pity** is a mechanic that **increases** the probability of each pull as you approach the **Hard Pity**. For the Fated Bond (""50/50"") contract system, Hard Pity is 80 pulls. 

In Asia, **Soft Pity** begins at 70, for both Fated Bond (""50/50"") and Exclusive Bond (""110"") contract banners. The rate at which the increase is different since there are more pulls for Exclusive Bond Contracts. For the Arms Deals, it appears to start at 60.

I'm not even sure how they bring this up without apologizing for being 'caught'. Even if they don't apologize for it, please just implement it. Prices on Global Paid items are already more money due to exchange rates and overall higher prices, this is just double dipping.

**TL;DR: Soft Pity isn't in Global, and it should be.**

# Standard Character Delay

Let's see, is having a 6-month delay for Standards worth the price of Cognitive Shards containing Limited Units and Limited Weapon Forging? Possibly.

A Cognitite for a character can potentially save you 160 pulls (Fated Bond). That's really good, and for Limited Units that's pretty incredible. Only issue is they take a long to accrue, so far looks like we've gotten 3 shards, which could mean we're looking at possibly 20 weeks per cognitite.

In any case, I think everyone agrees that 6-months is quite long. By the time they become standard in that time-frame many limited units will have replaced them in their respective teams. I think there's a couple of different ways they can approach it.

- Reduce the overall Waiting Period
- Release them alongside flagship updates (ones that update main story / crossroads of fate)
- Release them alongside anniversaries (Futaba, Ange).

The last option for anniversaries would be most in-line with the 6-month wait. However, it at least resolves an issue of timegating specifically for 6 months. For example Turbo would be right before Ange, then into Standard because Ange is an anniversary update.

Flagship updates for me personally is a better compromise if there has to be a wait at all, because main story and crossover events are big draws and pool updates would make those updates even better.

Removing or reducing the wait, would be the best option but I think they're pretty firm on this because of cognitive shards and lufel plan ex. Maybe they surprise us and drop it for Cherish going forward (doubtful / cope).

**TL;DR: Have standards join pool in Main Story / Crossover updates to make them more exciting, if there absolutely has to be a waiting period.**

# Acceleration (Loss of Filler Patches)

So Global has skipped two filler patches. There's 4 weeks of collecting resources, sos RM4 & companio coins, stamina, and daily exp + meta jewels that are just non-existent in Global. There isn't really a direct way to address this so here's what I suggest.

Those events that give coffee and double drops. Let's have more of those, increase their duration, and increase the coffee / quantity drops. Let's bring the missing events content to complete alongside other patch content (such as the Bessa event). For the other materials such as meta jewels and player experience they could craft new events exclusive for global to obtain them.

**TL;DR: Be more generous with coffee / double drop events since we're skipping filler patches**.

# Text & Other Issues

There are a bunch of text issues still plaguging the game. Such as Succubus, Lamia, Ame-no-Uzme, and the Strife Card Set having incorrect descriptions since Launch.

Global | Asia
---|---
ATK MULT+ | Damage Bonus
CRIT MULT+ | Critical Damage
HP RECOVERY | Healing

These particular stat names are egregiously confusing in Global, especially ATK MULT+ which has **nothing** to do with ATTACK. All current skills in the game don't even refer to these stats by their global name, they use the Asia identifier. For example Dionysus increasing Critical Damage.

**TL;DR: ATK MULT+ should be changed.**

I’ve been searching for instant coffee packets that tastes almost exactly the same as a cafe-bought Spanish Latte, or just a normal latte. I really like the depth of the coffee taste more, instead of the sweetness just overpowering the coffee.

I didn’t want to just buy a random packet, since I don’t wanna waste my money if I don’t like the coffee when I get home. So, what instant coffee brands/flavors do you guys recommend?",0,1757600288.0,nasikatok,5,0.5,False
1nea0s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tourettes/comments/1nea0s2/how_i_nurture_wellbeing_for_my_tourette/,How I nurture wellbeing for my Tourette,"I remember years ago when I was surfing the net looking for answers on how to live well despite having tics. I remember asking my doctor if people would kick me out of a job if they knew I had Tourette, he said if you do a good job no one will kick you out.
I was reading medical papers and personal anecdotes in hope to be comforted. Now I’ll be the one sharing my journey hoping it might be of help and motivation for others.

[ i did take medication but it had side effects, yet I’m not sure if it was the meds or my personality changing. I would like to stress on the efforts we put in the process to nurture wellbeing along having a tic disorder or Tourettes.]

I cannot stress enough about lifestyle changes. Tics get worse with stress, we were all told to manage our stress, but how? For me it looked like this.
I stopped taking meds because they actually made me feel worse. I started drinking tea instead of coffee. My favorite tea that I could see reaping its benefits is chamomile tea, it really helped me calm down. I also started therapy to tackle the dark thoughts I had. I enrolled in sports but had to leave. I genuinely saw the impact. When I was practicing sports my tics were way less, but when I quit I felt them coming back in their old patterns. Now I found the middle ground and I do rope jumping to get the excessive brain energy out. I no longer strive to be the top of my class, I study to learn rather than study to become #1, that’s just too much added stress. I signed up for a stable yet low income career because unemployment made my tics horrible. For now this is what I can remember and I rather not prolong this post further.

Managing life is already difficult as it is, but we still have to manage our tics on the side and juggle at life!
Don’t shy away from experimenting to find what is good for your brain. It can be nature, reading, sleeping, resting, essential oils, sudoku, chess, gardening, swimming, walking, star gazing, bird watching… in short, I say to everyone with tics to feed your brain well, you don‘t have to go everything or nothing mindset, do whatever is accessible for you and wellbeing will come along.

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.
