I'm curious though, where does the caffeine content come from? Green tea? Coffee berry? 

Because I'm noticing that often times, I feel like the energy drink has a more notable effect than a coffee with about the same amount of caffeine. (Been having brain fog and such the last couple of years, which seems to clear a bit with the enertgy drink.) Coffee, on the other hand, seems to be a hit-or-miss in effectiveness. (Altbough that has always been the case, so coffee is more like an occasional treat, and I haven't consumed it, or any caffeine, for the pick-me-up.)

Mind you, with the coffee, I actually try to use as few pumps of flavoring as I can ""get away"" with. (To minimize sugar.) And I get blonde roast only. (The others are too bitter.) So, I had considered sugar interfering, but I'm feeling like it's more related to the caffeine.

About a year ago, I (F 21) broke up with my boyfriend (M 21) of two years. The breakup was NOT due to my sexuality, just general relationship issues that 20 year olds have. At the time, I identified as bisexual, but since then I have gotten a better understanding of myself and my sexuality. Since the breakup I have not been involved with any men, and right now we are currently both dating women. To my knowledge (and that of a mutual friend‚Äôs) we ended on good terms, but I am not sure how to let him know (or if I even need to let him know) I don‚Äôt like men anymore. I don‚Äôt want him to feel offended or at all responsible for my change in sexuality, because it has nothing to do with our relationship or him as a person. 

What‚Äôs the best way to do this? Right now, the options I‚Äôm considering are:

A) Getting coffee or something to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù (we haven‚Äôt really interacted much since we broke up) and tactfully dropping in the small tidbit of me being a lesbian now

B) Getting a mutual friend to tell him

C) Finding a way to have a mutual friend subtly let him know during casual conversation or something 

D) Letting him find out naturally/not putting in any extra effort into letting him know - we broke up and we don‚Äôt need to know everything about each other‚Äôs lives (personally, I think it would be courteous to intentionally inform him, but some of my friends think it would be less awkward if he just found it out on his own)

1i8ort2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1i8ort2/considering_breaking_up_because_of_trust_issues/,Considering breaking up because of trust issues ?,"
I'm 31F with my boyfriend 48M since about 1.5 year. We met while we were both traveling around the globe ( we are still currently traveling together now). At first, I was only looking for sex/hook-up with him, mostly because I felt awkward about our age gap. He wanted a relationship, and eventually we ended up together. 

To be fair, he is a mostly a super nice person. Always here to give some help, handyman, fun, smart. Lot of small intentions everyday (prepare me coffee, massage me, etc) 
We have good time together and also some middle/long term projects. 

Nevertheless, he has deep trust issues + anger issues. Since the beginning, he jokes almost every week about when I will break up with him because he is too old or how I will educate my child I will have without him (he has a vasectomy, I may want a baby one day). That's the ""easy part"" to manage.

The difficult part to manage is : when he is tired or stressed, he will see bad intentions and or manipulations in misunderstandings / really small disagreements. For example : 

-> if I don't understand something he says, if he is tired he will quickly complain that I willfully misunderstand him
-> he can get really pissed off to make me repeat stuff when he doesn't get it the first time. 

More specifically:

-> We said we would stay 4 nights in some hotel but after 3 nights I want to move somewhere else because I don't like the place. I ask him how he feels about moving, he says he doesn't mind and tells me to make the decision. So I chose to move. The next night (in a new shitty hotel lol), he explodes saying the only reason we moved to this bad place is my tantrum. When I asked why he didn't tell me clearly he wanted to stay he answered I wanted so much to move I would not have listened to him... 

-> the day after I really take care to ask him specifically what he really wants to do and he yells at me like "" why do you act so weirdly ?"" 

-> tonight, I was speaking to him about a text I wrote months ago. He told me he never read this text. I was like : I'm pretty sure you read it because I remember this specific comment you made about it. He started to yell at me saying I lied (??) because he was super sure he never read it. He literally yelled at me without thinking at the possibility he may have just forgotten about this text, or maybe I mixed up with some other text.  Anyway nothing terribly bad (for me lol). But he went so crazy of the ""false accusation of reading my text"" he decided to sleep in another bed tonight. I told him before he went to bed he had to work on his anger issue, that his reaction was too much for such a small misconception, and he went even crazier like ""and now you say I have a problem ?"". I stayed calm but I'm super stressed inside. 

To be honest at this point I'm really considering breaking up because I'm tired of this impression of walking on eggs. Most of the time we really have fun so I'm not sure. 
But also, it's quite despairing to see him act like that because of obvious past traumas (grew up with some mythomaniac narcissist)... And thinking if I break up with him it will just trigger more his trust issues 

He is definitely a sweet person and I know we all have defects. Sometimes I just hope he would try to evolve. 

TL;DR bf has big trust issues due to past traumas. When he is tired or stressed it will come back for really small reasons. I don't know if I should stay or how to handle the discussion ",1,1737698215.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

I'm gluten free and mostly dairy free. I have severe constipation issues, I can't go without eating foods known to stimulate bowels (like prunes) as well as drinking coffee the next day (the coffee is what gets everything moving)

almost a month ago, i went every day for one week and my stomach was so flat, I didn't retain any water, I felt amazing. the reason for me bringing up the flat stomach is because my bloating is so bad I can look between 5 and 7 months pregnant just from constipation üò≠

I'm overly sensitive to miralax and other ""meds"", I tend to get extremely nauseous from them and it's never worth it. 

I can't afford (both financially and mentally) to keep going to the doctor about it. their solutions are always the same. ""do a full bowel cleanse and consume high fiber"" well, i already tried that multiple times. my body always ""resets"" 

I also get nauseous easily in general. i have to keep antacids on me at all times when I'm out of the house just in case.

The person I am considering rehoming my quaker to apparently lost the rescue she had acquired, so she is looking for another one. I normally would never think to let my bird be released to the care of someone whose bird had died, but, this one was apparently a rescue and, I guess the damage to the bird that was done in the prior home was just too much that the bird couldn't survive anymore, despite her trying to recoop lost opportunities.  
The lady seems like a good fit all other thhings considered. She said that her husband is a truck driver, and they will be taking the bird on the road with them. And that they like to go camping, and boating. Taking a bird on a boat makes me nervous. I'm fine with the truck driving though, assuming that cabin air in a semi truck is safe for a bird's respiratory system. She doesn't have any other pets, and has had quakers before. She is also willing to rehome the bird to me after I graduate college. But, she lives by a motto ""life is not measured by how many breaths we take, but rather the moments that take out breath away.""

1i8ofdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1i8ofdg/i_have_this_mind_boggling_talent_of_being/,I have this mind boggling talent of being rejected by women who have shown clear interest in me.,"I guess above all I‚Äôm saying this out of frustration more than anything and feel like I need to vent a bit. 

More often than not, I get rejected. Meaning I go on lots of first dates but not many seconds. I‚Äôd say 60-70% of the time I get no seconds dates. I guess having ADHD can make it difficult to connect with people sometimes and well I do struggle to socialize. So you can say I‚Äôm an acquired taste. 

Of course I‚Äôve had a few girlfriends and FWBs and one nights here and there but they don‚Äôt have happen often. Most of my dating life is going on first dates with no second. 

I obviously try my best to improve my social skills and always working on my personality through reading, hobbies, meditation, gym, etc. But simply put‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard for me. Truly. It‚Äôs very rare for me to date or sleep with someone I‚Äôm really into. 

And well this past weekend I went on date with a very cute girl. She was a bit too shy, but I thought we connect just well. We had lunch, then coffee, walk in the park. And it eventually I held her hand and she was cool with it. Eventually I kissed and she was cool with it. We ended the date making out, and she held me tight in the car for a good 2 minutes. When I walked her to her car and said bye, she again held me tight and put her head on my chest and stayed there for a while before we said bye. Sounds all good right?

Well no, cause she hasn‚Äôt really replied to my text or shown any interest.

Before that there was a match I had with another woman, but she never did reply to me. Fine, it‚Äôs cool, no replies on apps are common. Only one time we saw each other at the club. Both recognized each other. I didn‚Äôt approach cause I thought it‚Äôll be weird to approach someone who never texted you back. Well, all of a sudden she approaches me. Says recognizes me and wanted to say hi. We talked a bit, before she decided to give me her number. We left it at that, and before she left the club she went back to me to say bye. All good right? Again no, after exchanging 
 several basic text messages she never did reply to me again. Several days I send another messages saying how you doing and again no reply. 

Before that, another woman similar to the first. Went out on a date, finished with us making out, said a nice exciting goodbye/goodnight, text me when you get home/ see you later, and then nothing.

At the moment there‚Äôs this girl I took out a few months back who‚Äôs always texting me first and really into the conversation. We have seen each other at the bar often and last time she approached me and hugged me. Closing time comes and it‚Äôs clear she waited for me outside the bar, we talk and say goodnight and go back to our friends. She then texts me ‚Äúwyd‚Äù and well you know the rest, but once I tell her to come over she stops replying. This happened like 2-3 times with this girl.

I mean I‚Äôd understand, and it wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating, if it were me starting some of the interactions/being the first to show interests and then being rejected. That‚Äôs fine it happens. Or I‚Äôd understand if a girl rejected my kiss or something and naturally wouldn‚Äôt be interested in me for another date. 

Shit in a way I understand the behavior of these women too, I guess sometimes people get caught up in the moment, go home , think things through and realize they‚Äôre not interested‚Ä¶

I guess whatever, I‚Äôm not really blaming these women for anything‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just frustrating is all. It can really jade someone after a while. I never really know what I do right or wrong. Even on the dates that have to seconds or sex, I never know what went right. 

It‚Äôs difficult having a mental illness that makes connection difficult and not come naturally. ",1,1737696881.0,dating,2,0.67,False

A lot of my classmates and myself try to practice Korean IRL using what we learned in class... it sometimes goes smoothly with the Korean person or it sometimes gets lost in translation. 

For example, ordering a hot coffee seems to be easy enough... you can either say ""Ìôã"" or ""Îî∞ÎúªÌïú"" or just plain English ""hot"". The funny thing happens when my friend says ""Îî∞ÎúªÌïú"" and 
the barista looks at him with a wtf did you just order or say... and then the friend just says ""hot"". I told my friend that it's all about the pronunciation because of the batcheem.

Even our Korean teachers practice these kinds of pronunciation hypotheticals. And she assures us that it's correct when we say it. 

So this is my question, do you guys have any Korean words or phrases which are often misunderstood by Koreans, no matter if you said it correctly (close to the Korean pronunciation)?

Turned out to be married but still wants to continue.What's her intention?,"I am 28 yrs old, 5ft 11 average looking guy, I met this girl at the gym. She's around 30 yrs super fit and beautiful. She dresses very meticulously in skin tights. Claims to have been a physical instructor herself. My gym has slightly bigger male population all very decent guys but all are chatter boxes, I don't indulge in a lot of chatting, I always prioritize my workout. 

In the beginning a few glances were shared with her, after a month just some hi hellos, by the 3rd month I noticed her showing some interest in me, I first had my reservations as she's clearly older than me but I initiated the conversation.

Then on we started talking casually with a bit of personal things sprinkled in general talks, things were going good. I started looking forward to meeting her every evening.

She had a few damsel in distress moments, like not being able to start her scooty, I helped.

It was to a point where it felt like she's silently asking me for that coffee date. I was hooked. I wanted to date her as well but I felt teasing it out a bit. A little pre date foreplay üòÇüòÇüòÇ(the boys). I behaved as if I was blind to her signals. She was annoyed, but didn't budge so didn't I. The tension was very enjoyable.

Last month I saw her with a guy at a shop nearby, I thought he might be her brother that she mentioned and didn't thought much about it.  I was always curious as to why such a beautiful and friendly girl was single at her age? Although I had not openly asked her about it, but her actions and intentions clearly stated she was single or I thought so.

One fine day I happened to be at the same shop, same time as she came in and the shopkeeper greeted her as bhabhi. I went completely blank. She was very formal but slightly affected by the fact that I was standing near listening all this.

She continued her conversation while I left confused and conflicted. I was a bit sad and a bit relieved quite the irony of emotions. Since then we have talked but the spark is gone. I still find her feeling jealous when I talk to some other girl. 

Mannn, women are complex, now she doesn't show much interest but still expects me to not move on. What the hell does she want. I ain't no marriage destroyer. I am not willing to jump in this mess just to have a metaphorical happily ever after.

Please help make sense of this.( Note-We didn't do anything physical, except for a few handshakes)

Hi I hope everyone is doing well, I wanted to share my journey and how I am where I am today. I hope this helps, I know what it's like living with this for a lifetime it's the worst. I truly feel for those that are still suffering at the moment. But I want you to know that there is light at the end of tunnel if I did it you can too. Anything in this world is truly possible and I really believe that. Feel free to pm if you have any questions. I am not a doctor and this is not meant to be taken as medical advice, this is just my personal experience on how I conquered SIBO. Unfortunately I believe I lived with SIBO for a lifetime and just never knew, until I got an exam to confirm.

# My symptoms/extra stuff

* Constipation
* Hashimoto's Thyroiditis
* Bloating
* Anxiety
* Depression
* Brain fog
* Social anxiety
* Very very emotional for any little thing
* Irritability
* Bubbles in my urine
* Watery diarrhea
* Low blood volume (This caused me problems when using berberine because since it's a vasodilator it would cause me heart palpitations the fix was drinking some water with 1/4 teaspoon Redmonds Sea Salt anytime I took a vasodilator.)
* Heart palpitations
* Low back pain
* Knee joint pain
* On and off tinnitus depending on how hydrated I was
* Getting dehydrated to the point my pee was yellow after eating (The fix was drinking a ton of electrolytes with sea salt to make sure I was hydrated at all times.)
* Waking up with my heart racing and with a lot of fear (adrenaline rush)
* Insomnia (What helped me was raising my head on two pillows and also ensuring I was well hydrated once again.)
* Muscle twitching
* Restless leg syndrome
* Low blood circulation to hands when sleeping to the point they where numb upon awaking
* Inability to retain water (I would have constant trips to the bathroom as soon as I drank water or anything else.)
* Malabsorption (This was so bad I had to drink so much extra electrolytes just to feel hydrated and energized somewhat.)
* Inability to perform in sports physically compared to others around me, even the ones that were a lot less fit.
* Inability to concentrate or focus even in video games, I am lot better now and at sports too
* Addictive personality (to mask all the bad feelings)
* Sensitive to gluten and dairy

# Growing up with SIBO?/First time in Remission?

It all started at the age of 8 years old, I'm not sure to this day what exactly happened to me but I believe this is where it started. I remember that I started having this sharp pain in my right abdomen at first and 2 days went by and it just kept getting worst, suddenly I started feeling like something inside was twisting inside my abdomen at that point the pain was like an 8 out of 10. When this started, I started to cry literally all day from the pain, so this is when my parents took me to the hospital. I don't remember what happened at the hospital to well I just remember the doctors doing some tests, and after two days they sent me home with some antibiotics. GO FIGURE! The pain went away but they did more damage than anything. Going forward as a kid I started to suffer from depression, anxiety, social anxiety, insomnia and gastrointestinal issues (mainly bloating, constipation, and occasional diarrhea these all started mild and worsened as time went by) but I didn't know any of this at the time, since I was just a kid. I remember being in my room as a kid and just getting this feeling out of nowhere of extreme fear of dying or something happening to my family, and also this feeling of extreme sadness. I thought this was all normal and would just ride it out when it happened. Also my dad always told me growing up that men are tough and don't cry or act weak no matter what, this belief made me suck it up even though it was unhelpful at the time. I started gaining a lot of weight, I believe I was using food for self medication at the time, but I got really fat I probably weighed about 140lbs by the time I was 10 and went up to like 180lbs as I grew older and stayed around this weight up until I was senior in high school. Since this happened all the bloating and gastrointestinal symptoms were sort of masked even though they were there. The anxiety and depression I was experiencing from my gut issues were always making me feel bad about myself and making me self conscious all the time that I was fat and that I would be like this forever. In reality I was fat but what was contributing to these thoughts was the bloating it was making me believe I was way bigger than I was since I felt full all the time.

You can probably guess that with all these psychological and gastrointestinal problems growing up my life was ruined. I barely made it through high school with the minimum needed to pass the brain fog wouldn't allow me to focus on anything, and I had no energy to get stuff done. The summer of my senior year is when I decided I was going to lose weight and go on the journey of self improvement and I would do this no matter what it took. You may not believe this but I lost 45lbs that summer and when I went back to school as senior I was a completely different person physique wise. Now the way that I did it was extremely unhealthy but it makes sense now why I finally didn't feel full all the time. My diet consisted of only about 10-15 oz of grilled chicken, that was all, everyday until I got to the weight I wanted. (This may or may have not have put SIBO into remission momentarily.) Going forward I was able to maintain my weight by trying to limit how much I ate this time I would eat enough though and I was happy because for about 8 months my stomach didn't feel full all the time anymore or bloated. What I didn't know is that I was also starving the overgrowth of bacteria with this. (But I didn't contribute it to this I just thought it was because I wasn't fat anymore.) After a year of my new physique I developed a food eating disorder and from the time I graduated from high school to the age of about 22 I would lose weight by eating healthy this time and tracking my calories but then I would binge eat and gain it all back. When I would binge I would eat lots of junk food like pizza and chocolate chip cookies and by the time I was 18 a year after graduating high school I was back to square one with all my symptoms. I started college and was suppose to be an RN but my health once again failed me (lack of energy and brain fog like I've always had dreams I wanted to achieve but no matter how hard I tried how much caffeine I drank I always felt like crap) and ended up going to tech school to be a mechanic this was easier in my mind since I didn't want to deal with general studies, in reality I really wanted to be an RN but I didn't have the brain power maybe because of my malabsorption issues caused by SIBO? Or my gut being so messed up I couldn't make the necessary neurotransmitters for my brain? I never ended up being a mechanic even though I had my certificates, since my dream was to start my own business so I started going from job to job and ended up learning a trade in construction, but just to get through a day I would smash 2 energy drinks.

# Where things started getting better but not where I wanted /Network Chiropractic Doctor/Second Time in Remission without Knowing

When I was 23 I couldn't take it anymore and knew something had to change this is where I sought answers and was determined to get there no matter what. But without knowing that my main problem was SIBO (I had gotten use to living with the bloating and diarrhea that I thought it was normal at this point.) I was basically lost, because at first I was seeking holistic approaches for depression, anxiety, brain fog and insomnia (I had been only sleeping 4 to 5 hours a night for years and no supplement I took for sleep ever helped) because these symptoms I felt were holding me back tremendously and not allowing me to live my life I though if I could at least have the energy to reach my goals I would be satisfied. But I couldn't hold a job, go out with my friends or get a girlfriend. And I just watched as all my friends improved there lives, got the jobs they wanted, the house the picked fence and the whole 9 yards. Of course I was happy for them but I felt like I just could not function like they did, and I was determined to overcome it. Something that always helped me on the worst of worst days was listening to ""motiversity"" on Spotify, if I didn't keep those mindsets from those audios who know's where I'd be at the moment. SIBO is a horrible condition to live with. Also I never went to the doctors because I felt like they failed me when I was kid and I also thought they would just once again give me medication and just send me on my way. Plus I had heard of all the side effects with antidepressants or how most of the time they didn't help and then it was tough to get off them. I was determined to find a solution and told myself I would figure it out or die trying. Eventually I came across a holistic healing modality called Network Chiropractic Care through the internet. (Now from reading some of the posts I see here on reddit I have seen that a lot of people who have achieved remission have done it through healing there vagus nerve but most importantly there nervous system plus a few other things, so I now understand how this helped me at time.) The main reason I decided to start coming here was because since I was 10 years old I had chronic lower back pain on and off, I was scared my whole life growing up thinking I had kidney disease since every time I would pee I had a lot of bubbles that would stay in the pee in the toilet and I had read online this was a symptom of kidney disease and I was really hoping that  this wasn't the case. And that this would resolve it and that it was just a misaligned bone or something. (I now know this was from all the inflammation SIBO was causing and from C reactive proteins in my urine from the indigestion.) Another reason I started going to this special chiropractor was because I read online people were not only getting healed from anxiety and depression but they were coming out like a totally different person out of this healing modality in a good way. (Tony Robbins who is a really famous motivational speaker, one of my favorite, has this network chiropractic care done on him right before all of his speeches because of how much more confident and calm it makes him and how much energy it gives him.) They were more confident, braver and had the energy to reach their goals. After the first month of going here all of my symptoms were gone no anxiety, depression or gastrointestinal issues!! I was eating all kinds of food during this time without any issues!! I felt like a new man!! I had never felt this good in my lifetime or knew it was possible to feel that way. If you live in Texas in the Dallas/Fort Worth area do yourself a favor and go to Self Unbound I had to stop going because I live 2 hours away but for a year and a half this was so life changing that I was driving 2 hours once a week to get this done. For the first time in my life I felt normal and I started to notice that my health was even better than those I thought were healthier than me at the time it was crazy. I definitely recommend this! If you go to Self Unbound ask for Tyler, he's the main doctor but he's the best and he really cares about his patients on a different level! Tell him Jose from Tyler sent you. Going back to what I was saying about SIBO success stories where part of there treatment was to reduce stress, stimulate the vagus nerve, etc. I truly believe that part of our problem is a damaged nervous system this can be from trauma or really high levels of stress and cortisol or maybe even our own bodies being so stressed since our gastrointestinal system isn't working like it should. Going to place a like Self Unbound will help your nervous system heal but I personally put this healing modality at the top of the list if your looking to heal your nervous system that's literally these doctor's specialty. I will warn you that you have to be patient with this healing modality because depending on the individual it can take a few weeks to see results and I have seen many go and get impatient and leave while losing out on all the benefits. Unfortunately even though I was finally where I wanted to be I decided to stop going and continue with my journey, because at this point I realized I was symptom free but I never found out 0what caused me my symptoms and I almost felt as if there wasn't much of difference with going here and taking an anti depression pill. I wanted to know exactly what was happening with my body and make sure it was taking care of. I hadn't discovered SIBO was the villain.

# Finding out I had SIBO/Functional Medicine Doctor

At this point in time I started buying books and just read so many that talk about depression and anxiety still not knowing what the real problem was. Bloating and constipation were still present with diarrhea but I had learned to live with them to me the depression pain and short bursts of adrenaline I would get upon awaking were far more painful. Also without knowing anything one day I started taking a probiotic with 50 billion strains for men and it seemed to help at the time but then I ran out and I stopped. One day I discovered what a functional medicine doctor was and was thrilled. I thought this was the answer and it was, partially. For him to do blood work on me and check 100 markers I was looking at $1,000. But I really thought this doctor could help since he was a holistic doctor and I had already had a good experience with the chiropractor so I said what heck. My blood results came back normal except for the fact that I came back positive for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, again I thought this was it, I finally got the answer I was looking for. WRONG! P.S. if you decide to use a functional medicine only do it if you're looking to run blood tests that your other doctors don't want to run. Because most of the protocols they use you can either find in a book, YouTube or online. Now I'm not saying this is for all of them I'm sure there are good one's out there but just do your research after you know what you have. I ended up dropping another an extra $2,000 JUST for this doctor just to tell me I needed to go gluten, dairy, soy, bean and nut free and to give me list of supplements to take. And on top of this when I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's I quickly bought a book about the topic by the pharmacist Izabella Wentz and in this book it literally talks about what to do to put this disease into remission in a way more detailed manner than what the functional medicine doctor told me. The book even had the same protocol he gave me but better! The sad part about it is I even mentioned to him I had boughten this book and asked if it could help me he still proceeded to take my money which I worked extremely hard to raise and I even told him I needed time to raise it up. BEWARE. Now that I knew what I had was Hashimoto's I followed the functional medicine doctor's protocol he gave me I had already paid for it and thought I might as well give it a try. I followed it to the T and I started feeling better for about a month but I contribute this to the diet and this expensive supplement he gave me to take that cleans my liver. At this point I was extremely disappointed with this doctor and thought I hit a wall. This is when I started to research more on what I could do to put Hashimoto's into remission and I really started to believe that doctors were no help at all and if I was going to get better I needed to put matters into my own hands. I specifically started researching on Izabella Wentz's website and this is where I started suspecting I had SIBO because she has an article that talks about SIBO being just one of the root causes of Hashimoto's and that if you wanted to put Hashi's into remission you needed to get rid of SIBO first. All of the symptoms for SIBO lined up with me! She even had the whole protocol for SIBO she talked about the antimicrobial /antibiotics, low fodmap diet, elemental diet, prokinetics, digestive enzymes, Betaine HCL, OX Bile, Berberine and the list goes on all for FREEEEE. Now I started to feel like I was really close to achieving the health that I wanted and finally heal myself!! Just one problem I didn't know if I had SIBO for sure, even though I was sure of it. I ate my disappointment I had towards the functional medicine doctor and told him I wanted to get a test for SIBO/IBS but this time wasn't planning on spending an extra penny with him lol I just wanted to know if I had SIBO so that I could treat it myself. (I thought I already had the protocol.) I ended up doing the test and I came back positive for SIBO. Cheers.

# The partial fix

As soon as I knew I officially had SIBO that same day I started the protocol almost everyone in the SIBO community is familiar with oil of oregano, berberine, digestive enzymes, betaine hcl, coffee/carnitne/magnesium for motility. And for the first week I was back once again that same day the brain fog, depression, anxiety it all lifted. The only problem was I became extremely constipated by the end of the week and very, very bloated to the point I had upper right quadrant pain. And this scared me a lot because I thought I had somehow damaged my liver. So I stopped the protocol all together. (I now know this pain was just from so much gas built up and maybe undiagnosed gastritis) I now started feeling helpless I could always go back to the chiro but I really wanted to tackle this and know it was dealt with before going back. At the time I didn't realize my nervous system was highly involved with SIBO and that taking care of stress was an important part of the healing process, but it had to be something that relaxed your system way more than something like meditation, vagus nerve breathing, yoga, hot showers, saunas, etc. I had done all of these before with no clear result unlike the chiro which focused on healing my nervous system in a more direct approach. This is when I came across the famous hour+ long YouTube video that recommends Motility Pro, I ordered it before the video even finished and was really excited. Any way I got the supplement and it had no effect on me, what a bummer.

# Remission

One day my mom started telling me about this heating pad someone had recommended to her but it wasn't an ordinary heating pad I mean the price said it all the dang pad was $1,700, and it looked like a normal heating pad. But the person trying to sell it to my mom was saying that the company advertised this heating pad mainly for sleep but that she knew people who swore it cured there Hashi's and other diseases or helped them manage them so much it felt like the disease was not existent. At this point I was tired of spending money with all the doctors I had gone and the supplements paid for I was more than $9,000 plus in and on top of this I had spent $1,000 on an infrared red light therapy light that I didn't feel any type of  improvement with either. I was really skeptical about this heating pad but I told her I would get it and figured it would at least help me sleep if it didn't help with anything else. I ended up going out of town the week it was going to get here but when I came back I tried it the next morning I hadn't been watching my diet and I was really bloated and constipated. Most will find this really hard to believe and won't believe me but that's fine because I was a huge non believer of it too the only reason I even got it was because my mom wanted to try the heating pad herself. Now I have seen people say that when they're really bloated a heating pad helps with the pain but I had never tried a heating pad myself. Anyway the instructions said to place the pad on yourself for 45 mins to an hour, so I decided to place it on my abdominal area and 30 mins in I started passing gas and I also felt super relaxed just like when I would go with the chiro like the exact same. I was a little surprised but I thought nothing of it for some reason probably because I was negative about the whole thing. I decided to keep it on me the full hour, and I had to stop 10 mins before the hour because my constipation was relieved and I could not hold it. That morning I had a nice solid stool! I also felt like I wasn't full anymore. Going forward I believed in the pad but I stopped placing it on my abdomen and placed it on my back instead for some reason. I ended up stopping believing in the heating pad but then a month passed and I got so desperate with my symptoms and once again. I decided to start the protocol again but then the same thing happened I got really bloated, constipated and upper right quadrant pain. I quickly ran for the stupid expensive pad placed on my abdomen this time and this is when I had an **AHA moment**. While holding it to my abdomen I started immediately burping and passing gas. The upper right quadrant pain disappeared as well and my stomach was nice and flat! The next morning I decided to try an experiment I took the motility pro and placed the pad on myself once again for an hour and low and behold the answer to this whole SIBO thing may be motility after all, I mean the guy in the YouTube video already said it. But long story short I took not one but two trips to the bathroom and felt crazy energy I was back for the third time in my whole life!! NO SYMPTOMS!! And then I remembered how a long time ago that one probiotic I had boughten really helped me. I decided to bite the bullet and go buy some kind of probiotic but I wanted something natural. (I had seen a long time ago someone on reddit recommending coconut kefir) so I went with coconut cult from Sprouts even though it goes against what all the ""professionals"" advise. I took one serving of this coconut kefir which is about 1oz and I kid you not that same day when ever I ate I felt like I was cured I even had trigger foods which for me are rice and 4 tortillas with some shrimp. After this meal for the first time in a while my stomach remained flat, I was even able to burp hard once and pass gas. I am now months into this and have finally achieved my goal, I feel healthy no more gastrointestinal issues, depression or anxiety!! I am truly great full for my health now and I truly appreciate it.

# What helped and why

* Coconut Kefir (Started slow with 1 serving and gradually increased)
* Sleepm Heating Pad
* Motility Pro
* I still take digestive enzymes but I don't feel like I need them

Like the guy in the YouTube video (If you haven't seen it's titled How I Cured My SIBO ""IBS"" it's 1 hours and 46 minutes long) said, ""ITS REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP EVERYTHING MOVING"". And the motility pro paired with the heating pad moves everything in a fast way like the first time you use the heating pad you stomach start gurgling like crazy. Also the heating pad relaxes you so much which in turn I think calms the nervous system down and helps motility, again I'm not a doctor or a scientist. After this I believe that adding healthy bacteria via some kind of probiotic is important, this has just helped me to be in remission. And to be blunt I don't believe any of the doctors anyway especially the YouTubers. Also the probiotic literally helped me the first time around I just didn't realize it.

# Sleepm Heating Pad

After I realized how life changing this pad was I contacted the company to learn more about it and I came to find out why it's so effective the pad contains 16 Biocrystals and each Biocrystal has some kind of benefit. For example one of the crystals it contains is called Citrine Stone, this is suppose to help with digestion and blood circulation. The materials from the pad is made out of some cloth NASA uses. It's also a Class II medical device registered with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (Registration Number #3019315271). Here's small description I found: It integrates advanced energy vibration, far-infrared, and negative ion technology with the restorative benefits of biocrystals. This innovative combination brings together the natural healing power of nature and the sophistication of modern technology for a truly unique wellness experience. 

I was also told that since I bought this heating pad from a distributor that I am now a distributor and I am able to sell it apparently but this is not my main goal to be here, I just wanted to tell my story to help others and talk about what really helped me personally but if your interested I can help you order it since I am a distributor. If you go on their website there's no buy option you have to find a distributor to be able to order it. When you buy, you also become distributor yourself that's just how the sleepm company does their business for some reason. Other than that you can find it online on some random website just google it and order it right away if you're interasted in trying this for yourself.

Feel free to pm if you have any kinds of questions, after coming out of this I feel your pain and will help in any way I can. I got my life back and you can too.",1,1737695885.0,SIBOinRemission,0,1.0,False

I used to work early mornings in the Greenwich Village neighborhood when I wasn't in class, and back then I was a lot more of a bleeding heart than I am now (I was still fairly new to the city). I had a number of nutty interactions with homeless and begging folk, but there's one story i still tell on occasion that sticks out. 

One early morning, I'd stopped at Starbucks before work to get some coffee and breakfast, and was walking my way to work when a fella approached me while I was stopped at a red traffic light. He explained to me that his young daughter was waiting for him a few blocks away under some warm scaffolding (it was winter), and he was trying to find some help to get her some breakfast. I offered him the banana bread I'd gotten from Starbucks, but he rejected this, saying it would be ""too hard for his daughter to chew"". He then proceeded to ask if i would go with him to a McDonalds a few blocks away to buy food. I had to get to work, and didn't have time to go on an excursion, so I told him I couldn't do that. The man immediately changed his demeanor, became angry, and said, ""Oh, it's because I'm Black, right??"", and i was like, ""Dude, I'm leaving now"", and crossed the street and made my way to work. 

In retrospect, I doubt there was a ""daughter"". Cuz, like, wtf could she have eaten at McDonald's that would have been easier to eat than my banana bread? Lmao ",19,1737695434.0,ChoosingBeggars,3,0.91,False

""The File Format Debate‚ÄîWho Knew Saving a Logo Could Feel Like a Marriage Proposal?""

Ladies and gentlemen, let‚Äôs talk about a topic so niche, so specific, that even your cat wouldn‚Äôt bat an eye: file formats for motion logos. That‚Äôs right, we‚Äôre diving into the thrilling world of MP4s, MOVs, and‚Äîbrace yourselves‚ÄîGIFs. Why? Because choosing the wrong format can turn your sleek, animated logo into something that looks like it‚Äôs running on dial-up.


---

Act I: ""The Universal Lover‚ÄîMP4: The Format That Gets Invited Everywhere""

MP4 is like that friend who can charm anyone. Whether you‚Äôre at a social media party, presenting to a corporate boardroom, or sneaking your logo into an email signature, MP4 gets the job done. It‚Äôs lightweight, versatile, and looks good anywhere.

But beware‚Äîcompress it too much, and it‚Äôll lose quality faster than your phone battery at 1%. So, treat your MP4s with care. They‚Äôre like the extroverts of file formats: everyone loves them, but they burn out quickly if overworked.


---

Act II: ""MOV: The Fancy Cousin with a Taste for Luxury""

MOV is like that bougie relative who only drinks artisan coffee and insists on gluten-free everything. It‚Äôs high-quality, crisp, and perfect for professional-grade projects. If you‚Äôre working with high-end presentations, TV commercials, or video editing software like Premiere Pro, MOV is your best friend.

However, it comes with a catch‚Äîit‚Äôs heavier than your uncle‚Äôs holiday fruitcake. Don‚Äôt even think about uploading a MOV to Instagram unless you want to wait for eternity (or until your Wi-Fi collapses).


---

Act III: ""GIFs: The Life of the Party, but a Terrible Dinner Guest""

GIFs are like that one friend who‚Äôs amazing in small doses. They‚Äôre fun, quirky, and perfect for quick attention-grabbing moments‚Äîlike your logo doing a little jig on a website.

But don‚Äôt rely on them for long-term relationships. They‚Äôre grainy, lack audio, and can‚Äôt handle complex animations. It‚Äôs like inviting a comedian to give a TED Talk. Sure, it‚Äôs entertaining, but you‚Äôll miss the depth.


---

Act IV: ""PNG Sequences: The Perfectionist‚Äôs Paradise""

Now, PNG sequences? These are for the overachievers. Each frame is saved as a high-quality image, making it perfect for cinema-level animation and meticulous post-production. But, uh‚Ä¶ good luck with your storage. Your hard drive will fill up faster than a TikTok trend goes viral.


---

Act V: ""WebM: The New Kid on the Block""

WebM is the Gen Z of file formats‚Äîsleek, efficient, and designed for modern platforms. It‚Äôs perfect for web use, with smooth compression and excellent quality. But, like any new kid, it‚Äôs still finding its place. Not all platforms support it, so check before committing.


---

Closing Punchline: ""Pick the Right Format, or Watch Your Logo Suffer in Buffer Hell""

In conclusion, picking the right file format for your motion logo is like dressing for the occasion. MP4 is your all-rounder, MOV is for premium vibes, GIFs are the comic relief, PNG sequences are for perfectionists, and WebM? Well, it‚Äôs the edgy one that‚Äôs still proving itself.

So, next time you‚Äôre exporting that logo, ask yourself: ""Am I wearing Crocs to a black-tie event, or am I putting my best (formatted) foot forward?"" Trust me‚Äîyour logo will thank you.

I am getting mine removed in 12 days, so far have had it in for almost 2 years, Two years may not be a long time but they sure feel like it when you entirely lose your sense of identity and control over thoughts, emotions, perceptions, etc. 

Throughout the entire period of having an IUD, as well as my entire life, I have been particularly interested in natural remedies, especially coming from a family of doctors who saved so many but failed to save themselves after downing all the pills in the world. I‚Äôve always struggled with finding my place in the world and my life has not been easy at all so difficult does not scare me, but I wish that word captured the hell this iud put me through in its entirety. 

Anyways, I‚Äôm sure you are all in the same or similar boat in a sense so I am not here to complain I am here to share with you all of my discoveries that sustained me from, honestly, ending it at one point because of the chaos in my mind, and the things that after extensive research I‚Äôm sure will sustain me furthermore after removal.

P.S. My doctor is incredible and always listens to my concerns. Sadly, like many doctors he was only given information to the point of it seeming beneficial to the client until i came along and with sustained self awareness and battling through this, we came together to realize it‚Äôs not what is presented and it seriously does harm women. He has since helped confirm all of the steps I‚Äôm taking and the research I have been doing. He ended up very sick at one point and where western medicine couldn‚Äôt help, Ayurvedic medicine did which pushed him to partner with me on this discovery even further.

Let‚Äôs get into it. This is nothing serious nor something that could harm you if you tried, but through years of experience and experiment upon self with Anything and Everything I have found the best natural ways to balance your hormones and take your life back into your hands.

We‚Äôll start simple.

- Morning tea, which is not only anti-inflammatory, it is also one where each of the ingredients battles cancer and prohibits it from ever developing if not present, as we all know ovarian cancer is a possibility BUT not a rule, so don‚Äôt let that worry you, we‚Äôre simply taking precautions. (Because, the health care system has proven to put bandaids on until we are absolutely in need and codependent on the system for their long term profit). This tea balances cortisol levels which will in effect affect your serotonin/dopamine and help regulate heart palpitations, anxiety and depression. 

Ingredients: Holy Basil, Saffron, Cloves, Cardamom, Rosemary (can add Mullein leafs if your lungs need cleansing after trying to fix your emotional irregularities through smoking substances like I did for a while). You can look up each of the individual ingredients and their benefits but here are links to make it easier. 

Holy Basil: https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/basil-benefits
Saffron: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/saffron
Cloves: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/benefits-of-cloves
Rosemary: https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/rosemary-tea
Mullein: https://www.healthline.com/health/mullein-leaf

*I purchase tea bags from Amazon and fill them myself with the above*

- Peppermint tea at night is a great addition  

- Coffee: if you‚Äôre a coffee lover like me but feel like your chest is about to explode each time you come into contact with caffeine since Mirena, Matcha may have a strong amount of caffeine, but did you know that it also has the strongest natural concentration of L-theanine? Try to substitute your coffee with matcha. Another thing you can do, is add MCT oil in powder form, which is the only extraction of coconut oil which passes through the blood-brain barrier and therefore provides sustained energy when mixed with caffeine (makes a great creamer with some milk). I use MicroIngredients brand and have tested Every Single One on the market, this is the only natural one without thickeners present.

- Next, let‚Äôs talk supplements. Starting simple once more. Something I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard of, is the l-theanine and magnesium bisglycinate. Always works instantly for anxiety relief. L-theanine a natural amino acid while magnesium relaxes your muscles, therefore the stomach cramp you probably have from holding your breath subconsciously due to the overwhelming anxiety. Aka, you‚Äôll be able to breathe again and fall asleep easier. Night time is great for this.

- Morning relief and how to set up your mind, body, spirit for optimal performance: L-tyrosine. Naturally produced within our brains and stimulates dopamine production, where even after you stop taking it, it has trained your brain to function at its optimal production rate. 

 - NOW. LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY. 
5-HTP is also a friend that you‚Äôll want to accompany you on this journey 
BUT, NOT WHILE YOU HAVE YOUR IUD IN.
(Little background on the above, mirena iud alongside with other hormonal birth control, stimulates the production of progesterone. Progesterone, over time, affects serotonin production. Serotonin and dopamine are directly correlated. THE PROBLEM is, when serotonin is *over-produced* for *long periods of time*, it starts to *suppress* dopamine production. Don‚Äôt believe me? Do you feel numb lately? Thought so.

5-HTP stimulates serotonin production, so you will want to take it once you remove the iud to ease you off the hormones that were previously being dumped into your body. That is the crash everyone is talking about, your body is going crazy because all of the sudden, not only is your dopamine production suppressed due to having the iud, you are now lacking the serotonin that somewhat kept you going and away from being entirely checked into a mental hospital. Maybe not the time for jokes but hey, if it wasn‚Äôt for humour, I would‚Äôve given up but instead it helped me fight through this and seek solutions. 

This: this will be unconventional. But again, I have travelled far and wide, I have studied lots of cultures alongside with their practises and their healing medicines. I will be incorporating a 1 day on 1 day off psylocibin microdose. I‚Äôve worked in data research and human behaviour and have ran data sets, as well as tested on myself, that this indeed does help anxiety and depression, hell, it convinced them that your mind, body and spirit are inhabitable places for any negative thought. On the one day on, you will be creating new neuroconnections and new neuropathways, on the day off, your brain will force itself to operate as if it were constantly ridding of old patterns and creating new more favorable ones.
I‚Äôd start with the above first for a few weeks to balance hormones, then this, this will just propel you into the beautiful life that exists where your body is in tune with nature, your mind is in tune with your soul, and you, are the one taking authority over your choices. This suggestion is for people that have struggled with anxiety and depression long before this might have worsened their symptoms

P.S. something on a spiritual level that will help you, I hope, is the reminder that each hardship we endure, was Possibly given to us because we carried the strength necessary to overcome it and come up with solutions for those that may face that same challenge precisely but not have the strength, the tools, the persistence to seek out solutions. You will always find yourself being of help to another with the tools you seek out during your utmost hardships. This is one of hundreds for me, but I‚Äôve been able to advise thousands on variety of issues because of those. Remember you will come out of this stronger and more confident in your choices knowing that it was you who helped you when the healthcare system that is supposed to look out for you failed you. It‚Äôs a silent revolution within self and will serve you on any journey going forward. 

P.S. (2) if any of you were prescribed mirena as myself due to anemia (low blood pressure, low hemoglobin, low iron), it will help for a bit but it‚Äôs still just a bandaid. I had anemia since I got my first period and started losing blood. No iron pills helped. I discovered it‚Äôs because I couldn‚Äôt absorb folic acid well which was a sort of prerequisite for iron absorption. You can stop there if that works. If it doesn‚Äôt, run a blood test for Folate/Folic RBCs, it will show if there is any mutation in your dna that does not allow for folic acid to be absorbed properly, quite common, but too much work for doctors to go that deep, again I am lucky mine listens to me and has helped me make those discoveries. Now, if you have that dna mutation, you will start with L-carnitine and can include garcinia to that. It will help the mutation and bring back natural absorption process of folic acid over time. Then you will take folic acid. Then you will take iron. That is your solution cycle. 

VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. Ironically, when you have less blood in circulation and lower blood pressure, you get heavier periods. Your body is almost on a subconscious suicide mission. If you have a heavy period, you have a deficiency. Before you fix the deficiency, if you still have heavy periods you will want to take a blend of calcium/phosphorus/vitamin c. Watch how your blood flow will lessen and contribute to the healing of that deficiency. BUT it‚Äôs a precaution, not a solution. You have to discover the deficiency and directly attack it on a separate note. C/P/C blend is to sustain until you find the root cause.

Okay guys, I really hope some of this helps to some of you. Not everything will be for everyone. Feel free to do your own research of course. I have intuitively come across these solutions with time and as I solidified the balance between intuition and logic I discovered that our bodies and minds Always. Know. Best. 

Listen to yourself ladies you are most definitely right if you don‚Äôt feel right. 

(There is so much more in terms of practise, spiritual and psychological I could share but let‚Äôs take care of our health first and foremost then we can work on the mindset that helps sustain a healthy body) Anatomy of Spirit by Carolyn Myss is a great book if you want to find out the underlying reasons for your body being sick in the first place. 

P.S. (last) If our bodies are not healthy, outside of unnatural substances and devices we put in them, then we must be blocking the eternal flow of health. Think about it, it‚Äôs a similar concept to a light switch. When it‚Äôs on, the electricity is flowing. When you turn it off, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúturn on the darkness‚Äù but the switch rather resist the light. Health and abundance are our birthright, the world is just a messy place right now, but try to keep that in mind so you can get through this odd time of never ending political, socioeconomic, quantum and astrological shifts all piled up in one.

1i8nxxi,https://i.redd.it/g24cbz4rjvee1.jpeg,Dreams of others.,"Hey all.  Thought I would share one  many dreams I've had about encounters with others.  While I have not had any real world encounters I have had many dreams all with different beings. 

The most recent was an interesting experience.  I have attached an AI generated image to help give some context. 

Sitting on a stool outside what appears to be a cozy coffee shop, I slowly put on my ice skates.  Excitement comes over me.  It's been a while since I could feel the freedom of gliding on the ice in the open air. 

The coffee shop is above the ice rink with a long set of increasingly widening stairs leading directly down to the frozen surface.  The backdrop full of buildings, shops and street lights, reminiscent of large town or city square. As I make my way down to the rink, there are dozens of people already skating, laughing and enjoying themselves. 

The warm sun mixed with the cold, brisk air is refreshing as I take my first stride. I take in the sights and sounds around me as I make my way around the outer edge of the rink. 

Out of my left peripheral I notice a sudden movement, I turn just in time to see a small girl finish her fall to the ice.  Her pink jacket and hat a stark contrast to the dull ice surface.  I smirk and think to myself ""we've all been there kid, hopefully she's ok"" 

My eyes are fixed on this girl, I want to see her get up with a giggle, and continue her fun.  I take a few more strides and my smile fades, I notice two things.  She's not getting up, and no one else seems to notice she's fallen. 

I change direction and head her way.  My feelings of joy have faded into concern.  This little girl lay nearly motionless on the cold surface.   Why is no one checking on her? 

As I approach the fallen skater, her back to me, I ask if she is ok.  I hear a slight sob but get no answer.  As she starts to finally get up, she struggles with getting her footing on the ice.  Her feet betray her a bit and she spins around in a slow wobble with her face pointing down to her feet. 

I reach out and place a hand on either shoulder, helping her steady, and ask her again, ""are you ok?  That was quite a spill""

Now steady on her feet, the girl raises her head to meet my gaze.  I'm struck with a sense of relief and immense joy as our eyes meet. 

Nestled between a pink wool hat, and her puffy pink coat, is blonde bangs whisply flowing in the wind over two large almond shaped eyes.

Meeting those eyes with my own seems to have frozen me in place.  Not only could I not look away if I wanted to, I had no urge to break eye contact. Like I never wanted to look anywhere else again.  It felt like I was gazing into the deepest parts of the ocean.  The world around us seemed to stand still and dissapear as if my senses no longer perceived anything except these eyes. 

After what felt like an eternity, seeing only the vast depth and darkness of the void, I hear her voice, not with my ears, but with my mind.  It seems to come right from the center of my brain.

""Thank you.  I am not hurt.  Your kindness will be remembered"" 

A smile appears accross her narrow face, and her eyes slowly shut. 

Suddenly I wake up in my bed.  I am overwhelmed with emotion.  I feel immense joy, and crushing sadness.  It was as if I had made a new best friend and lost them all at the same time.

Most of all, I longed for the gaze.  To stare into the depths of the void.  Like there was something incredibly important to find in the darkness.",0,1737695120.0,gettoknowtheothers,0,0.25,False

Healthy relationships take care and attention. 

This weekend, how do you plan to or think you can intentionally care for your relationships? Consider taking time to get a cup of coffee with a friend Saturday morning or get your family together to do a much-needed chore around the house. Sunday dinners with your family or friends are also a great way to spend time with those you love. It can be literally anything and can be as simple as including another in something you have to do this weekend like grocery shopping or shoveling snow. 

These things may seem simple but you are caring for your relationship by intentionally seeking to make it stronger. 

In the comments below, share your goals for relationship care, ask for help coming up with ideas, or just share how you feel about devoting your time and energy to caring for the important people in your life. If the experience was positive, share it below to inspire others so we can celebrate your wins! If your plans do not go well or fell flat, share that too!

I am 19m, and every step dad i have gotten are awful. The one i have to deal with right now decided to cut off all of my internet access because i had a break between sessions at my college where i didn't go outside as much as he did when he was young (I currently don't have a job because I don't want that on top of the 10 classes making 35h of class/week without counting homework).

Almost every time I interact with them they tell me I am doing something wrong. That or my mom tells me something obvious which makes me feel like she is condescending (like \`\`put on something warm it is cold outside\`\` couldn't have foreseen that on my own/sarcasm) When I tell them I don't like it, they tell me that this is what a mom is supposed to do, in which case I don't need a mom anymore.

She doesn't teach me things that I ask her to teach me, but the she tries to teach me how to pay stuff with a debit card when I know full well how to do that.

Last and next summer I have an internship relating to the thing I study and that gives me the opportunity to live completely on my own. To them it is almost as if it didn't happen because they still think I am not able to live on my own. It is like they are unable to trust whatever I say without having them see it for themselves ( they visited three times counting the times they helped me move my things )

The only thing they drink is coffee in the morning and at lunch, then wine in the evening, I have told them that this affects our relationship because they are even dumber when they drink alcohol but they don't believe me.

I have talked to them multiple times about all of these subjects and they haven't done anything to change any of it, noticeably at least.

The session just started and I just have to power through until may 23 and the winter session will end and I will be in another Internship, then another school session, then another internship and theoretically I should be done, I will probably have a couple classes extra to finish afterwards, but I could get a job and do them at the same time. I think with the money I will earn (the internships are very well payed (avg. 23$/h)) and the money I have saved up (I have about 20k that i can pull out if ever needed including emergency funds but I don't want to use them) I could live somewhere else during the in between session. (I live in Qu√©bec, I study at cegep limoilou) I also have some friends I could live with. When I leave her home I am leaving her life, I will cut all my contacts with her.

My mom is jealous of how much money I have in my bank account, and she is about to retire (same time i would theoretically get my diploma) She also thinks it is completely normal for someone to still live in their parents home at 30, at this point I think she is lying to use me.

I see my dad sometimes in the weekends and she is jealous of him because I actually like him.

The fake leather seats sweat with late August humidity, and my backpack, slunk over one shoulder, slaps against the back of each seat as I walk from the last row toward the door. I share the stop with Jenna, who, when we were in elementary school, had a trampoline in her backyard, and Michael, whom, when we were toddlers, I was forbidden from playing with because his brother told my brother that the only way to heaven is through Jesus Christ. I walk down the road behind Jenna and Michael. My house comes before theirs on the dead end road. To the west are the homes and the river. To the east is the woods.¬†

My parents bought the house just after they were married. At the time, it was a small two bedroom home with access to the basement from the outside. As their family grew, so did the house, and by the time I had come into being, my dad had doubled the house‚Äôs size, but failed to install central air conditioning.¬†

My grandpa helped my dad build the house. Together they formed a unique beautiful ranch home with vaulted ceilings and large picture windows over the front door. My mom designed the landscaping. A large Oak tree, with a zinnia garden at the base of its trunk, was on one side of the front lawn. A pond, surrounded by several varieties of ferns and hostas, was on the other. The sidewalk stretched from the front gate along the large detached garage and up to the front steps.¬†

¬†I walk up the front porch and through the red front door into the foyer. My mom sits at the kitchen peninsula, her back to me, her head tilted upward, eyes squinting in the sunlight that streams through the skylights, her right elbow planted on the counter, a cigarette dangling from her right hand, smoke dancing in the streams of light. I take off my shoes and leave them on the ground in the foyer.¬†

‚ÄòPut your fucking shoes away,‚Äô she says. She doesn‚Äôt turn her head. She doesn‚Äôt move her arms. She just sits as still as a lion before it pounces.¬†

I ignore her and walk through the kitchen. I rummage through the cabinets and fridge to find some food. She doesn‚Äôt move. Her cigarette, still dangling from her hand, grows a long ash that falls onto the countertop next to the Dave and Buster‚Äôs ashtray I gave to her on my 10th birthday.¬†

‚ÄòEating. Always eating. No wonder you‚Äôre so fat,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòI could tell it was you when you walked through the door. You open the door fat. You walk fat.‚Äô

I stop looking for food. ‚ÄòFuck you,‚Äô I say. I walk to my room. I slam the door. I lock it. 	I clear the floor in front of my door, brushing dirty laundry, old children‚Äôs books, action figures and fish tank accessories aside with my foot, and pull my dresser over in front of the door. I brace the dresser with a two by four I keep under my bed against my bed frame. I put my backpack on the desk my dad made for me. I open the two windows, turn on my ceiling and oscillating fans, and find Harry the Orangutan, my favorite childhood stuffed animal.

¬†I sit on my bed with him and lift his arm, revealing a hole in his armpit. I dig around inside his stuffing and pull out a small bag of weed, a lighter and a pipe I made out of a dowel rod scrap from my dad‚Äôs bin in the garage. I pull a box from under my bed that has empty toilet paper rolls, rubber bands and dryer sheets and quickly make a filter to breathe out through. I turn on the Dark Side of the Moon and take as long of a drag from my pipe as I can. I lay on my bed and stare at the ceiling fan.

*Two more years,* I think. *Just two more years.*¬†

 	I lay there as tingles pass through my body in waves that start from the small of my back and roll up through my shoulders. I raise and lower my back with them. Over and over and I follow the sensation with my back, and I let my mind wander. *When I see the fan, I know it's there. But if I don‚Äôt see it, is it there?* I wonder. *What would Ricky think?*¬†

Ricky is the best to be high with. Once, we went to the grocery store and bought a box of Bubba Burgers and eight burger buns. We grilled the burgers, smoked a bowl and ate them all on his back patio. We would play guitar poorly and sing Jason Mraz at the top of our lungs. We once ate a whole bag of potato chips while lying on his bed. ‚ÄòRicky,‚Äô I said ‚ÄòI just found the best way to eat a chip.‚Äô He looked at me, opened his eyes wide and stared at me. ‚ÄòCharlie. What is it?‚Äô he said. I took one chip in my hand and extended my arm over my head. ‚ÄòStart like this,‚Äô I said, ‚Äòand then slowly, very slowly, while staring at the chip the whole time, move the chip to your mouth.‚Äô Ricky took a chip in his hand, extended it above his head, and at the pace of a sloth, lowered the chip into his mouth. ‚ÄòIt builds the anticipation, and nothing tastes better than anticipation,‚Äô I said.¬†

I become anxious to be with Ricky, laying on his bed with him, listening to Led Zeppelin and eating chips. I was anxious to be anywhere other than here. He is at work today. Danny is with his girlfriend. So is Adam. So is Mike. Nick and Josh are at Vinny‚Äôs, and though I can go there, Vinny‚Äôs basement smells like cat urine, and his parents won‚Äôt let me spend the night. I text Ricky to let me know when he gets off work.¬†

I hear my doorknob start to rattle then a knock. ‚ÄòWhat?‚Äô I say.¬†

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Dad. I‚Äôm going to work.‚Äô

‚ÄòOkay. Give me a minute.‚Äô I put the weed and pipe back into Harry‚Äôs armpit and put him in my closet. I undo my barricade and open the door. ‚ÄòIs there any dinner?‚Äô

‚ÄòYour mother didn‚Äôt make any.‚Äô

‚ÄòAre there any leftovers?‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know Charlie. Why don‚Äôt you look.‚Äô

‚ÄòMom‚Äôs in there and she‚Äôs drunk again.‚Äô

He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. ‚ÄòShe‚Äôs asleep on the couch now. You should be okay.‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòWhen are you sending her back to rehab?‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know Char‚Äì‚Äô

‚ÄòFuck you both.‚Äô Mom sits up on the couch and grabs her pack of cigarettes.‚ÄòFuck you Steve. Fuck you Charlie,‚Äô she says.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm going,‚Äô says Dad. ‚ÄòLet Rick know that he needs to get his laundry out of the washing machine.‚Äô

‚ÄòI don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs home,‚Äô I say.

‚ÄòFuck Rick too!‚Äô Mom‚Äôs voice grew louder ‚ÄòThe maid quit! He can do his own damn laundry.‚Äô She fumbles with her pack of cigarettes and finds it empty. ‚ÄòSteve, give me cigarettes.‚Äô

‚ÄòLet me know if things get really bad,‚Äô Dad says to me and begins to walk away.

‚ÄòSteve! I said give me some god-damn cigarettes!‚Äô¬†

‚ÄòJesus Christ, Carolyn!‚Äô he yells. ‚ÄòI bought you three packs this morning. How the hell did you smoke three packs today? What did you do all day?‚Äô

‚ÄòThe maid quit!‚Äô she says.

Dad tosses a pack of cigarettes toward her. They bounce off the top of the back of the couch and hit her in the shoulder. She exclaims in pain, grabs her arm and doubles over onto the floor. ‚ÄòYou fucking asshole! You abusive fucking asshole!‚Äô¬†

He turns back to me. ‚ÄòI packed your lunch. It‚Äôs in the fridge. If you leave tonight, bring it with you.‚Äô

‚ÄòDo you have any cash?‚Äô I ask.

‚ÄòWhat do you need cash fo‚Äì‚Äô¬†¬†

Mom interrupts him. ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs a fucking asshole who takes all the money. Where‚Äôs my money, Steve? Where‚Äôs my credit card, Steve? Where‚Äôs my car, Steve?‚Äô She sobs between words, still clutching her arm and laying on the ground.

‚ÄòI gotta go,‚Äô he says and walks to the front door. I grab my backpack and follow him.

‚ÄòI‚Äôm leaving too,‚Äô I say.

‚ÄòGrab your lunch,‚Äô he says, ‚Äòand text me where you end up.‚Äô

‚ÄòI will. It will probably be Ricky‚Äôs, or maybe Nick‚Äôs.‚Äô

Dad leaves the house but the smell of Brute, his favorite drugstore cologne, lingers behind him. It's his working smell. His leaving smell. He has several smells. His Christmas smell is cedar and kerosene, which he wears while making adirondack chairs in the garage as Christmas gifts for one of my nine sets of aunts and uncles. His out in public smell is cigarettes and coffee. His off day smell is barley and hops.

He works midnights as an airplane maintenance manager for United Airlines. He started as a mechanic at a small area airport, but when he asked my grandpa for Mom‚Äôs hand in marriage, Grandpa told him he needed to get a real job in order to support her. So Dad applied at United. Over the years, he worked to get a promotion so that he could make more money.¬†

He wasn‚Äôt happy though. Soon after his promotion he had to fire Pedro, his work friend. I liked Pedro. He would be at our house sometimes when I would get home from¬† elementary school, sitting on the dock with a fishing pole leaning against the railing, a Miller Lite in one hand. ‚ÄòHeyyyyyy Chuck,‚Äô he would say, ‚Äòthey‚Äôre biting today.‚Äô I would sit and fish with Pedro in the fall. ‚ÄòSee that ripple there?‚Äô ‚ÄòThat‚Äôs the discharge pipe from the water treatment plant. It stirs up all the muck on the bottom of the river, and the little fish come and eat it up. If there are little fish there, there are big fish there to eat them!‚Äô When Pedro stopped coming, I asked Dad why. ‚ÄòI have to pay the bills,‚Äô he said bluntly.¬†

I grab my lunch, stuff it into my backpack and leave the house, my mother still yelling, and swearing at me as I close the door. I see Jerry, our next door neighbors to the left, leaving his garage and walking to his front door. We make eye contact and he shakes his head and walks inside. It's dark out now, and I text my brother Rick not to come home. I then text Ricky again to call me when he gets off work.¬†

I meander through the neighborhood, passing the homes of my friends. I see Kim, Nick‚Äôs mom, through their living room window, watching TV, but Nick‚Äôs car isn‚Äôt in the driveway. I pass Adam‚Äôs dad‚Äôs house. All of the lights are out, and Adam is only there every other weekend. Josh‚Äôs kitchen light is on, but his mom‚Äôs voice carries through the front door and she is not in a good mood. I walk for hours until I return to Giant Oak Dr. I stand at the end of my driveway and see, through the front kitchen window, my mother sitting at the kitchen peninsula, her back to me, her elbow resting on the counter, her hand raised in the air, a cigarette dangling from her fingers.

If it was just the smell of coffee, I'd be fine... but it creates a strong burning smell too.  I have an ""allergy"" to both synthetic fragrances (all of them, it's an awful thing to live with) ... and anything burning also gives me horrible headaches, almost immediately.  I mean, even if the garlic gets burned in the oven, other family members have this condition.

So that part, I'm used to.  The strange thing is that I can still smell that hours later, next day, etc.  I aired out the whole apartment with windows open (it's like zero degrees here in Chicago) and the smell still comes back.  He certainly isn't down there grinding coffee, and he only does it once or twice a week.  I've increased my spiritual contact, and have had some great meditations... but the burning smell seems to be gaining in resilience.  I'm up late airing out the place in the freezing cold, and popping over-the-counter pain meds, none of it fun.

I'm wondering if there is something spiritual happening... that the burn smell sets off?  Combined with the rituals (to Clauneck several times, Bune a couple times, and a little Mammon and Beelzebub - totally new to demonaltry) I've been doing in my bedroom since I moved here a few months ago.

1i8nkvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1i8nkvp/i_would_appreciate_any_input_on_this_story/,I would appreciate any input on this story.,"Chapter 1: Ghosts
The Sun had long ago laid its bright face against the pillowy dunes. The world rests now. The deep blues and blacks of the night sky brighten the horizon with the promise of moonlight.
The wind blows relentlessly and harshly. Yet its waves, unseen, bring warmth radiating from the sands. Its noise brings sound to my ears. 
I walk, unseen by the creatures who have yet to make themselves known. While wild, the small birds have found their homes, tucked away waiting for the warmth of the morning sun. 
Singular bright pinpricks of light now dawn. Showing their light, like hope, for all to see. Though they be millions of light years away, their light shines just for me. 
My skin warm and reddened from the winds blowing, reminds me of its existence from time to time. It does not make itself known constantly only seemingly when no other thoughts exist. 
This arid landscape sings a gentle soft lullaby. Its sounds so soft and quiet that if my mind wanders I cease to hear its song. 
My footprints linger behind me, a slowly disappearing shadow. I look over the landscape eyes tired from a long day of seeing. They are dry from the waterless air. 
The calm leaves me a restless mess inside. The anxiety of living a haunted life seems to permeate every aspect and moment of my being. I pull out a cigarette from my pocket and light it with the flames of my young fire. The juniper smoke mixes with the tobacco as I inhale deeply. The warm vapor fills my lungs and my head clears. The calm rushes back replacing the panic that existed. 
I look at my small fire. The pops and crackles kick up small embers that float slowly heaven-bound. ‚ÄúIf there is such a place,‚Äù I think. My eyes follow the soft-hanging ashes upward. I view the twisted tormented junipers that speckle the sparse sand. 
My bedroll has been laid on the ground. The softest flattest part of the area I could find serves as my nest for the evening. I rest my heavy body atop the wool blanket and waxed canvas. My eyelids pulling downwards with the weight of the day
In my sleep, I see them. I always do. Their spirits call to me from across the sand. I want them to go. I can not escape their calls. It is she who calls most prominent. ‚ÄúAustin‚Äù she whispers with the wind. I know she is not real, but in my nightmares I see her. Stark blond hair and bright blue eyes, ghost-like as she stands before me. Her hand outstretched for mine. I reach knowing this will be the same as all the many visions that came before. The putrid stench of blood and spent gunpowder fills my nostrils. Her face becomes warped and disfigured. A memory of the last time I saw her. 
I jolt awake. The morning sun writes a promise to end its slumber with brilliant yellows and oranges on the horizon. My body is soaked from a mixture of dew and sweat. I light up another cigarette and start my morning routine. I place the cold coffee pot on the campfire, as level as I can make it. I'm praying the water will boil for me this morning. 
Against the dull landscape, I can see off in the distance cattle down in the valley. These are mine to watch and they seem to already be grazing on the Indian grass. Their hunger is never-ending. My horse, Dusty, hitched to the tree looks to me for directions. The day has begun. 

Chapter 2: Travelers
The long, hot day again beats me down. Moving cows furthers my exhaustion. The earth once again settles down for its daily slumber. 
	Against the brilliant purples and pinks, something feels different. Then I see it. Between myself and the huge rock sentinels that outline the valley, there are invaders. Strangers to this palace with their tarp-covered wooden wagons. I see the wagons circling a large fire.

I'm of a European background, 175lbs, handsome, well groomed, slim/athletic build (go to the gym 3-4x per week), have a good job, my own place and have a car. I have never been married and dont have any kids. My hobbies are board games, video games, exercising, watching stand up comedy, horror, action films, discovering new music, love hiking or taking walks by the beach. I'd explain my personality as laid back, harmonious, funny, happy go lucky and witty. I live in the east end and I also drive. 

What I'm looking for:

A sweet, caring, independent type of lady who takes good care of herself. A lady who values trust, communication, honesty and monogamy. Bonus points awarded if you are 35 or under and into fitness and healthy eating. I love to connect over conversation, board games, coffee, food, wine, music and movies so if you like that sort of stuff, chances are we will probably get along well.

On a first date I'd like to take you out for coffee, bubble tea or maybe even a movie or bowling etc... ",1,1737693608.0,r4rToronto_Clean,1,1.0,False

As I‚Äôve gotten older the less things or people I‚Äôm around the happier I seem to be. The only downside of that is I miss simple connections. 

I crave deep connections/conversations that not many people can even handle, which is fair sometimes but others times I wonder what our skill sets would be if we didn‚Äôt have the ability to communicate through social media or messaging apps. Would it be better? Would we learn more about people? 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am one definitely that has failed to do so in the past talking to new people but when I do find someone I click with I want to find out ALL about them. What was it like growing up, hardest lesson(s) they‚Äôve ever had to go through, I want to know more than just ‚Äúwhat do you do for fun‚Äù ? 

FYI, my pet peeve is that question. Which leads me into you learning a little about me:

Reasoning behind that pet peeve as a question is that it what I do for fun can be ever changing. It can change from the friends I‚Äôm with, to the seasons. It‚Äôs such a loaded question that can be broken down into many, many more questions but we don‚Äôt take the time to do so. 

So now that you know a pet peeve here are a few other things that may or may not interest you. 

I love the outdoors, eventually one day I will live in the mountains and hopefully drank my coffee on the porch every morning as the sun rises. I enjoy hiking and camping, I‚Äôd rather cook then to ever eat out again even though I‚Äôve had some amazing food. I dream of owning a farm, growing my food and living simple. I just got an order of seeds and I hope to start them inside! I haven‚Äôt made the best decisions in the past but I‚Äôm learning each and every day. 

Hopefully this message finds you well and if I‚Äôve made an impression I‚Äôd love to learn more about you! If not, I hope this post finds you well. ",2,1737693496.0,R4R30Plus,3,0.75,False
1i8ngxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1i8ngxa/now_i_understand_what_beans_i_prefer/,Now I understand what beans I prefer!,"Three months ago, I came by a video about coffee beans roasted with brown sugar in Malaysia. The closest thing I found was MightyOakRoasters' Koke Honey. It's a honey processed coffee bean that has some fruit of the cherry left intact to impart flavor. The flavor made me realize that I like light roast that doesn't taste too fruity. Unbeknownst to me, I won't find this taste anywhere else. I make a double espresso with some foamed milk, nothing crazy. The flavor though is mild smooth light body taste that has a light fruity essence that decays quickly giving this coffee a layered depth.

Today I tried beans from Georgio's, it's the fourth roasters I've explored so far. They also have a honey processed coffee bean but was sold out. I went for a medium roast labeled as bold and with little to no acidity. So is ""bold"" referring to that bitter aftertaste? I think I enjoy a Light Roast that have very low acidity.

Edit: Oh yeah I finally found the solution to the spraying/channeling issue I've been having. I changed out the shower screen, then tried different distributor tools until I found a powder receiver cup that has magnetically attaches to the portafilter.

Generally, 1 to 2 tablespoons of coffee per 6 ounces of water is recommended.**

Coffee lovers know that the right coffee-to-water ratio makes a big difference. Too much coffee can make your drink bitter and too little can make it weak. Finding the perfect balance can seem tricky, but it‚Äôs actually quite simple. The key is understanding how much coffee grounds you need for each cup.

This can vary based on your taste preferences and the type of coffee you are using. In this blog post, we will dive into the details of measuring the right amount of coffee grounds per cup. This will help you achieve that perfect cup every time.

# Coffee Ground Basics

Brewing the perfect cup of coffee starts with understanding how much coffee grounds to use per cup.¬†**Coffee Ground Basics**¬†are essential for achieving that rich, aromatic flavor you crave. This section will explore the different types of coffee grounds and the importance of grind size.

# Types Of Coffee Grounds

There are several types of coffee grounds, each with its unique characteristics. The type of coffee ground you use can affect the flavor, strength, and overall quality of your coffee. Here are some common types:

* **Whole Bean:**¬†Coffee in its purest form. Grinding just before brewing ensures maximum freshness.
* **Coarse Ground:**¬†Resembles sea salt. Ideal for French press and cold brew methods.
* **Medium Ground:**¬†Comparable to sand. Suitable for drip coffee makers and pour-over methods.
* **Fine Ground:**¬†Similar to table salt. Perfect for espresso machines and Aeropress.
* **Extra Fine Ground:**¬†Almost powdery. Best for Turkish coffee.

Using the correct type of coffee ground impacts the flavor profile and extraction time. For instance, using coarse grounds in an espresso machine can result in under-extraction, making your coffee weak and sour. On the other hand, using fine grounds in a French press can lead to over-extraction, producing a bitter taste.

# Grind Size Importance

The size of your coffee grind plays a crucial role in the brewing process.¬†**Grind size**¬†affects how water interacts with the coffee, impacting the extraction and flavor. Here‚Äôs why grind size matters:

|Grind Size|Brewing Method|Extraction Time|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coarse|French Press, Cold Brew|Long (4-12 minutes)|
|Medium|Drip Coffee Maker, Pour-Over|Medium (4-6 minutes)|
|Fine|Espresso, Aeropress|Short (1-2 minutes)|
|Extra Fine|Turkish Coffee|Very Short (30-60 seconds)|

Using the right grind size ensures optimal extraction.¬†**Under-extraction**¬†happens when coffee is ground too coarsely, leading to weak, acidic flavors.¬†**Over-extraction**¬†occurs with too fine grounds, resulting in a bitter taste.

For the best results, match your grind size to your brewing method. Experiment with different grind sizes to find your perfect cup. Remember, consistency is key. Invest in a good quality grinder to achieve uniform grounds.

# Measuring Coffee Grounds

Measuring coffee grounds is crucial for making a great cup of coffee. Knowing how much coffee to use can change the taste and strength of your brew. Understanding the right amount helps you enjoy a balanced and flavorful cup every time.

# Standard Ratios

The standard ratio of coffee to water is essential for a consistent brew. Typically, the golden ratio is about 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee for every 6 ounces of water. This ratio can vary based on personal preference and the type of coffee maker you use. Here are some common guidelines:

* **Drip Coffee Maker:**¬†Use 1-2 tablespoons per 6 ounces of water.
* **French Press:**¬†Use 1 tablespoon per 4 ounces of water.
* **Pour Over:**¬†Use 1 tablespoon per 5 ounces of water.
* **Espresso:**¬†Use 1 tablespoon per 2 ounces of water.

These ratios serve as a starting point. Adjust the measurements based on your taste. If the coffee is too strong, reduce the amount of coffee grounds. If it‚Äôs too weak, add a bit more.

|Coffee Maker|Coffee Grounds|Water|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|1-2 tablespoons|6 ounces|
|French Press|1 tablespoon|4 ounces|
|Pour Over|1 tablespoon|5 ounces|
|Espresso|1 tablespoon|2 ounces|

Use these guidelines to start, but remember to experiment. Your perfect cup may need a bit more or less coffee. Find what works best for you.

# Using A Scale

Using a scale to measure coffee grounds offers greater accuracy. A scale helps you achieve the same taste each time you brew. Here are steps to use a scale for measuring coffee:

1. Turn on your scale and set it to grams.
2. Place your empty coffee filter or container on the scale.
3. Press the tare button to reset the scale to zero.
4. Add coffee grounds until you reach the desired weight.

For most brews, a good starting point is a ratio of 1:16. This means 1 gram of coffee for every 16 grams of water. Here are some common weights to use:

* **Drip Coffee:**¬†15 grams of coffee for 240 grams of water.
* **French Press:**¬†30 grams of coffee for 480 grams of water.
* **Pour Over:**¬†20 grams of coffee for 320 grams of water.
* **Espresso:**¬†18 grams of coffee for 36 grams of water.

Using a scale ensures each cup of coffee has the same strength and flavor. It removes the guesswork and helps you perfect your brew. Start with these measurements and adjust according to your taste.

# Brewing Methods

Making the perfect cup of coffee starts with knowing how much coffee grounds to use. Different brewing methods require different amounts. Let‚Äôs explore how much coffee grounds you need for some popular methods.

To be clear, I think LDS and JW doctrine is a load of crap. But it's so funny to see these Christians *almost* develop critical thinking skills. Yeah, there's no proof that Joseph Smith didn't make it all up. Guess what? There's no proof that a virgin was magically impregnated by a God. There's no proof that Jesus walked on water.

You can't require proof for one thing, but not another. I can't claim that ""unicorns are real, and we don't need proof because only faith is required,"" and then turn around and demand proof for the existence of Yetis.

Many Christians will go into great depths to debunk Mormonism, and I just wish they applied that to their own holy text, too. The cognitive dissonance is just insane.

Much of the dislike of LDS/JW also comes from their rejection of the Trinity, but I've never met a Christian who can accurately explain it to me, and they can't even seem to agree on what it means.

I have a few friends, but they live a little far away and we are so close that I can and do end up doing pretty much anything with them (walks, baking, errands, laundry). For the first time in pretty much ever, I‚Äôve kind of been vibing with someone and I‚Äôd like to ask them if they‚Äôd like to hang out outside of our classes together (platonically). We did go on an outing a couple years ago but we weren‚Äôt the greatest of friends, and we didn‚Äôt do it again. If I offered now, I think there‚Äôs like an 80 percent chance she says yes (in an affirmative, actually planning stuff kind of way), and a 50 percent chance we actually end up having the time and drive to plan something. I‚Äôm going to put myself out there and try, but I‚Äôm lost on what to actually suggest. We aren‚Äôt close enough I think that going to either of our houses wouldn‚Äôt be weird, but we are still teenagers, I don‚Äôt think people go out for lunch or coffee just like that‚Ä¶.

hi everyone!

i (32 F) am coming here to see if anyone can relate to or find a thread in my symptoms and if my idea of seeing an ENT again is worthwhile. i have no formal LPR diagnosis but have been diagnosed with acid reflux first as a teen and then in 2021. i have struggled with globus/tight throat and have had myriad diagnosis ideas throughout my 4 years of hellish symptoms. 

please bear with me the context is longer than i wish, but due to the complexities of LPR i feel like maybe yall will understand‚Ä¶ 

Context/Symptomology:

All my life: allergy enduced asthma that ebbs and flows

2021: 
- i wrote in my notes app the following for a doctors appointment in April 2021: 
	‚Ä¢	‚Äúi‚Äôve having intense nausea and gagging, usually in the mornings, for about a year. It comes and goes in terms of intensity but has been fairly constant, sometimes leading to vomiting. It‚Äôs hard to say what sets it off, but sometimes it seems to be food, or not enough food, coffee, beer, other alcohol sometimes, my neck being touched, or intense bouts of anxiety/emotional distress. my primary discomfort seems to be in my throat but my sometimes has stomach pain too. 
	‚Ä¢	throat: swelling of throat around esophagus that causes gagging and constant swallowing
	‚Ä¢	wrenching and gagging
	‚Ä¢	stomach: vague feeling of sickness/ nausea from the stomach up
	‚Ä¢	started an SSRI with the guidance of my psychiatrist ‚Äú

Late 2021: 
- stopped drinking coffee bc it caused immediate flare 
- Went to an ENT who concluded nothing was abnormal
- Went to a gastro who was very rude and asked if i had ‚Äútried journaling‚Äù‚Ä¶ she reluctantly ordered me an endoscopy late 2021: results were evidence of esophagitis from acid reflux with presence of eosinophils in my LES, no evidence of h pylori and no celiac
- Barium test 2021: normal 
- Prescribed PPI but it exacerbated symptoms so i stopped 

2022: 
- started seeing a dietician who helped me understand my stomach acid was actually quite low. we worked together to slowly increase my food intake because by this point i could barely hold down more than a slice of white bread due to the constant pressure on my throat and gag reflex. during this time i took betaine HCl and ate primarily very cooked down food for easier digestion
- quit alcohol march 2022 (still sober!)
- After about 6 months (Aug 2022) I was able to eat tomatoes and raw vegetables again without gagging

2023/2024 
- symptoms better/were OKAY in that my symptomology wasn‚Äôt constant but would come and go depending on stress (primarily around high stress transitions like traveling) 

Late 2024/early 2025 
- my symptoms are coming back again. Ironically I am seeing a dietician again, because I‚Äôve been diagnosed with prediabetes. She was on the one who brought up my earlier Endoscopy and was curious about EOE and LPR. 

‚Äî

I am not sure I have EOE because I don‚Äôt struggle with any of the swallowing issues (getting food stuck) but as I‚Äôve done research on LPR i think it‚Äôs more likely. 

During flare ups, I tend to have like a thick mucous in my throat, though my nasal passages are clear. I really struggle with the feeling that someone is squeezing my neck/esophagus and the gagging sensation is unbearable. I have an intense fear of flare ups now because of this. I don‚Äôt suffer from any voice hoarseness, traditional heart ‚Äúburn‚Äù feeling, and any coughing I attribute to asthma though my asthma symptoms are less these days. 

I am reconsidering going back to a gastro/ent but tbh I feel kind of hopeless and want to avoid the run around. Any thoughts/advice/tips? ",2,1737692759.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

I have a good friend nga empleyado sa isa ka coffee shop in Uptown, ug sila ra pud ang garoast sa ilang beans since August last year hangtod karon.

Nashare niya iyang work experience sa among group of friends kay nag-depress siya tungod sa nahitabo. Wala siya gipasweldo sa iyang 15-day work (Dec 26 - Jan 9) ug walay memo/notice. Ug sa udto sa January 15, ang mga kauban niya sa trabaho kay nakadawat na sa ilang sweldo, pero siya wala pa. Naga-ask siya sa isa sa mga owners, nga co-owner pud sa sikat nga shop sa Limketkai, about sa iyang sweldo, pero wala siya gireplyan. Pati sa ilang group chat, nag-ask siya, pero giingan lang siya nga dili daw pataka ug pasangil, ug giingnan nga wala pa nahuman ang 15th ug kinahanglan pa maghulat. Nung giunsent ra ang pinaka-last nga message.

Pagka January 16, giremove siya sa tanan nga group chat. Giingnan siya nga tungod kay nakaabsent siya once sa January 14 nga wala nakapananghid, pero pag January 15, nag-duty gihapon siya, ug naka-chat pa siya sa owner nga nagkatawa.

Naluoy mi sa iya kay bisan barista siya, gitagaan siya ug admin/paperworks nga wala‚Äôy increase sa sweldo bisan pa nga nag-ask siya.

Naa pud siya mga bagay nga gipang-share sa amo bahin sa mga owners, ug murag luoy kaayo ang mga empleyado didto.

Giubanan namo siya pa DOLE kay nahadlok siya nga basin naay problema. Naghulat pa mi sa letter, unta ASAP para mapeace of mind na siya.

1i8n3sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/finfast/comments/1i8n3sb/india_coffee_booming_fy2025/,India Coffee Booming FY2025,"#IndiaCoffeeExports have witnessed remarkable growth, reaching $1.29 billion in the fiscal year 2023-24, almost doubling from $719.42 million in 2020-21, according to a press release by the #PressInformationBureau in Delhi. This surge is driven by increasing global demand for India's flavorful coffee varieties, solidifying its position as the #7thLargestCoffeeProducer worldwide.

In the first half of January 2025, India exported 9,300 tonnes of coffee, primarily to #Italy, #Belgium, and #Russia. The exports are dominated by Arabica and Robusta beans, which account for three-fourths of the country‚Äôs production and are mainly exported in #UnroastedForm. However, there is a growing trend of exporting #ValueAddedProducts such as roasted and instant coffee.

Domestically, coffee consumption has grown significantly, rising from 84,000 tonnes in 2012 to 91,000 tonnes in 2023, fueled by the rise of #CafeCulture, increasing disposable incomes, and changing preferences in both urban and rural areas.

India‚Äôs coffee production is concentrated in the Western and Eastern Ghats, with #Karnataka leading the way, contributing 248,020 metric tonnes in 2022-23, followed by #Kerala and #TamilNadu. These regions‚Äô #ShadeGrownCoffee plantations not only boost the industry but also support #EnvironmentalConservation.

The #CoffeeBoardOfIndia has launched initiatives like the Integrated Coffee Development Project (ICDP) to meet growing demand. This project focuses on improving yields, expanding cultivation to non-traditional areas, and ensuring sustainability in farming practices.

A notable example is the #ArakuValleyProject, where collaboration between nearly 150,000 tribal families, the Coffee Board, and the Integrated Tribal Development Agency (ITDA) has resulted in a 20% production increase. Supported by loans from the Girijan Co-Operative Corporation (GCC), this project highlights how coffee farming empowers communities and contributes to #AatmanirbharBharat.

With export incentives and logistical support, India is cementing its position in the #GlobalCoffeeMarket, enhancing both domestic production and international competitiveness.
