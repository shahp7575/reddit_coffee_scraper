I'm from Germany and would like to retire my existing Nespresso machine.

My wife and I drink **2 to 4 coffees a day**.  
My wife always has a **cappuccino** and I usually have 1 lungo and 1 cappuccino.

I don't like to buy cheap and twice, so I'm looking for something high quality that I'll enjoy. But it doesn't have to be unnecessarily expensive either.

After doing some reading and watching YouTube, I have set my sights on a **Linea Micra** as my new machine.  
Is there anything against it?

Otherwise, what is the name of the black scale that a lot of people here use?

Which grinder do you recommend for this machine?

Is there anything else I should consider?

1fybfv5,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1fybfv5/steam_wand_issues_after_descaling_breville/,Steam wand issues after descaling (Breville Bambino Plus),"Hey everyone,

I’m having some issues with my steam wand on my Breville Bambino Plus. It’s barely 4 months old, and the problems didn’t start until after I ran my first descaling cycle. I used citric acid (following James Hoffman’s instructions), and afterwards, when I used the machine for the first time, the steam wand wouldn’t work when I tried to steam manually. Instead, the temperature and steam lights started flashing and blinking. Interestingly, it works in auto-steam mode, but the flashing and blinking return when I switch to manual steaming mode.

I used the needle tool that comes with the Breville Bambino Plus to clean out the steam wand holes. The flashing lights randomly stopped after a few tries, but now the steam pressure isn’t as strong as it was before. It doesn’t seem like it’s pushing out air as much as it used to.

Any advice would be appreciated! I’m not sure what to do exactly. I worry that the citric acid ruined my espresso machine. I really don’t want to have to send it back to the supplier and be without coffee for more than a week or so.",1,1728317386.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1fybe9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/roleplaying/comments/1fybe9v/m4f_her_childhood_friend/, [M4F] Her Childhood Friend,"Sara and I had been introduced in college at a time when neither of us were really looking to settle down. We had our fun but nothing formal happened. It wasn't until after we graduated and we reconnected through some mutual friends that we started to seriously fall for each other. Sara had gotten a job at the city's hospital and I was working for real estate firm. Our families seemed to really like us together and we took the next step in buying a condo together and before we knew it, I popped the question. Being from a well-off family, I was able to afford a decent sized ring that Sara really liked. It was a fairy tale.

  
The whole time we were dating and after our engagement, Sara told me that she was upset that her childhood best friend hadn't seen her in so long. It had been so long that I haven't even met you. Sure, tons of FaceTime.. but that didn't count. Sara was so excited that you agreed to be her bridesmaid but knew that you'd have to eventually travel here to Raleigh in order to get your dress fitted.

  
The wedding... I wouldn't say that I didn't enjoy the process of planning the wedding. It's just that.. To me, a wedding was just a party amongst friends. By the time we were a few months out from the big day, she had already blown the budget. I had agreed to pay for part of the wedding along with her dad. Regardless, the pieces were starting to fall into place. One missing piece, your dress was being taken care of this weekend when you were visiting.

  
It's the morning that you're getting here, a Friday, I was planning on taking a half day at work. I'm drinking coffee and looking at some mail. Long story short, there's a bill for a wedding expense that I didn't know about. I find out that Sara had gotten a ""separate"" wedding budget from her father. We both leave for work pretty upset. She's upset that I'm not giving her a dream wedding and I'm upset at the thought of her deceit.

  
A few hours into my workday, I get a text from Sara. ""Sorry about this morning, I want to talk about this tonight. I'm stuck here for longer. Are you able to sneak out of work and pick her up from the airport? :) <3 xoxo""

  
I see the text and I don't really have an option. The ""her"" is you and I'm on my way to pick you up now...  


Hey all! So I had started this idea for someone else that doesn't want to play anymore but the idea is the your character is my fiance's childhood best friend and we haven't met yet. There is plenty of room for you to provide background. Our characters haven't met in person, only via some FaceTimes with Sara where I was in the background. I wrote this in first person but happy to do third person too!

  
I am detailed, interested in a natural and realistic development. I am very patient and I love to write! I also love references for our characters.

  
I have years and years of playing experience. I look for longer posts to get us started and then typically do paragraph responses as we get into the play. Looking for a good mix of play and smut but I don't want the role to be smut heavy, I do enjoy amazing storytelling.

  
Interests: bareback, oral, anal, unprotected , creampies, lingerie, heels, shorts, short skirts/dresses, long slender legs, rough, light hair pulling and spanking, oral (giving and receiving), mutual attraction/teasing/seduction.

  
Limits: scat, gore.

  
I really hope to hear back from you to discuss the role more! I desperately want a long term play. You can respond to my start or we can discuss the roleplay first. You pick.",1,1728317276.0,roleplaying,0,1.0,False

The other day I popped in, got 2 coffees, got my stamp which meant I get a free pastry then went to pay.

My partner tried her card which declined so I said I'll pay. I tapped my card then their payment system crashed. The lady behind the till said that's fine, it'll take 15 minutes to make the pastry and they'll reset their system in the meantime.

I waited for the food and when it arrived I went up to the till to pay for the coffees and there was another lady at the till who said ""no it's ok, the food was free because you got the stamp""

I replied ""yeah I know but I'm just paying for the coffee"". She looked at me confused and said ""you already paid for the coffees""

I replied no, the machine wasn't working and the other lady will tell you. She said that the other lady is on her break but she's sure it's been paid for.

A queue was forming behind me so I just thanked her and left.

What can I do to help better our bond? ,"Long story short, my partner (22 F) and I (25 M) have been together for a long while. We have 2 kids together, a 3 year old and a 1 year old, both boys. My partner has high functioning autism. I have my own mental health issues but am very good at hiding them and portraying a happy demeanour. My partner, being autistic, can become very sensitive to things, and captivated by them. My instant response is to want to offer a solution, although, in these harsh moments, that does not always help. I want to be able to offer support, but I simps can’t seem to find the proper angle to help. I find validating how she’s feeling when upset helps, but does not always solve the problem. I want her to know I’m on her side, she has my support, and my attention. 

To speak on our past, I have done some pretty horrible things. I cheated about 2-3 years back. At the time, I was in full blown addiction, having gotten addicted to opiates but kept it hidden from everyone, doing them every single day constantly for upwards of a year or two before finally getting clean when our relationship initially fell apart. Since then, and for every fuck up thereafter, I have lived with an immense feeling of guilt and shame. I dislike myself in ways I didn’t think were possible. Having her and my kids I’m my life really has helped me pick up and try forgiving myself. But just when things seem to be getting better, I always find a way to destroy things again. Around the same time I cheated, perhaps a little before, I had a pornography addition. I would watch porn, and save images I was attracted too, too my phone. I had private videos of past ex’s and I, or girls who sent me private images saved to my device. I had lost this phone inside a chair at my brothers house, and lost it remained for a long, long time. Around the end of my addiction, the girl I had cheated on my partner with had contacted her and come clean about what we had done, and from there, we broke up for a year. During this breakup, I did date someone new for roughly a month, before realizing I was using said woman to cope and quickly degraded into a depressed mess realizing what I had lost. During this time, my brother found said phone in the chair when they were throwing it out and returned it to me. I knew what was on the device. And although I didn’t go on the device besides when it was first returned to me, I kept it. I didn’t delete anything. Didn’t throw it out. Didn’t wipe it. I kept it as is with the porn intact. The phone sat. For a long time untouched. When one day, my dumb ass decided it be a great idea to put it in the same desk my partner and I would use for our sexual stuff. This occurred a while after her and I had gotten back together. So there the phone sat. Until one day, my partner found it and decided to go through it. I seen the drawer open and didn’t think anything of it. A bit later she asked me to come in, and there she was, phone in hand, porn open. I mistook a video she brought up for her in the first 2 seconds in my panic, which was the icing on the cake. I got pretty defensive. We managed to work around that. 

Fast forward to the final “incident”. We were trying the bar scene. We finally had a night to ourselves where both the kids were gone for the night. While out at the bars, someone had approached us, and I failed to introduce my partner to said person. And again, later, when someone else approached our group. At this point she was already feeling very unappreciated. Fast forward to a few bars later, and we run into a group of old friends we’re familiar with. Said group of friends, were talking to me a lot, being touchy with me (one girl had put her hand in my chest, another on my arm, but nothing sexual). Additionally, one of the girls had made a joke that was inappropriate, as I was having a conversation with a girl about a music artist her and I shared a mutual interest over, our friend made a joke about my partner losing me as a lover to said person. And I laughed instead of denying she would ever lose me. Later into the night, I’m drunk, being a dumbass, and I forget my partners drink at the bar and walk off to the table we were at while she was in the washroom. Her having a history of being roofied before, didn’t sit well with her, and a fight ensued after that where I left, she stayed, later that night, something horrible happened to her, of which I won’t discuss out of respect for her. 

So here we are now. We’re at a point where I can feel things are at the edge. I know in my heart and mind I love my partner dearly. She is my best friend and I could list a million qualities I love about her. I don’t know why I do the things I do. Lack of respect. Lack of realization. Total mindless behaviour? Forgetfulness? Or just not caring? I hate it, and with it, comes a deep hatred for myself because all I can think is, if I had just done things right, done things differently, or said the right thing, we wouldn’t be here. Last night we had a discussion where she spoke on feeling 50/50 about our relationship. 50% of her is scared to leave because she has love for me, but she’s scared of taking the kids from me as they’re attached to me. She’s scared of what my family may do to combat her regarding custody (which I argued I wouldn’t let happen). And the other 50% of her wants to leave because she’s tired of being hurt. She wants to believe all the reassuring things I’m saying to her, but it’s all been said before; and every time she gets comfortable, something happens. Way later into the night once the heat died down, she said it was more like 5% wanted to leave, 95% wanted to stay, yadayada, but just the fact that in the moment she had felt as she did, more worried about the consequences of leaving me then her own happiness leaves me with a sense of unease. 

Theirs nothing left. theirs no possible way I can screw up. I don’t watch porn. I don’t talk to other woman. I don’t follow models on Instagram. I don’t have Snapchat. I don’t look at other woman while out. The only way I could fuck up further is if we go out and I don’t recognize the signs of a woman invading our boundaries by being too touchy or saying something inappropriate and me not doing something to correct it. We’re supposed to be going to a Halloween party later this month, and want to stay away from liquor. We were talking about doing shrooms but we both fear it may unlock some realization in the other person that results in the end of our relationship. The love is there. She wants to believe I can do better. I want to do better. I’m in counselling. We’re doing couples therapy. I’m back on all my medications to try and get my mental health under control. I’m doing way more than I ever have for her in our home life with the kids, and simple quality of life things like making her food, bathing the kids, making her coffees in the morning, letting her sleep in while I take the kids in the morning, playing games with her so she feels included. But theirs still something missing. I’ve made posts on Facebook appreciating her. I’m posting more photos of her. But it’s still not enough. I need to do more. I need to make up for everything I’ve put her through. A part of me wants to rush it And solve it all now. But I know that can’t be done. So it comes to my question. What can I do to show her, that her staying, isn’t something she’s going to regret. How can I show her that in my heart and soul, she is the only girl for me? How can I show her that she’s loved, appreciated, heard, seen, valued, cherished… talk is so cheap and I’ve used every work humanly possible to talk my way out of the shit I’ve done in the past. Theirs nothing left to say. Action is all I have left. But it’s hard. Neither of us have a car. We’re full time parents. I’m open to the idea of her having time off to go see her friends occasionally. We’ve both agreed to staying clear of the bars, at least for now. If I don’t do something, then eventually another man will. I want her to see just how much she means to me. I’m ready to change. I’m ready to put my foot down, put in the work, and improve. I love her and I don’t want to lose her. She’s still here. So it’s now or never. I need ideas. Life advise. Breaking up simply isn’t an option. I’ve never met a girl like my partner now. She is so special in such inconceivable ways and we click so well for the most part. She satisfies nearly all my needs flawlessly unlike any previous ex could. I can’t find it in my to cope with the concept of losing not only her, but my whole family structure. Not waking up to her and the kids every morning is a nightmare.

Lately, he’s been liking my stories more. He messaged me asking about one of them (bike riding), we talked for a minute, then I decided to shoot my shot and ask him to go bike riding with me sometime. 


He agreed and said that it would be good to catch up. He asked if a certain day would work, and I said yes. The morning of, he messaged me confirming that we were still on. I said yes, and he picked a spot that was a halfway point for us. 


We met up and had a decent time. We biked pretty far, and stopped to get some coffee. He held the door open for me, and was about to pay for the coffee but I beat him to it. We stayed there for a bit and talked about our summer, family, school, etc. 


We laughed a bit, but I was a bit quiet. And nervous. At the end, he helped me with my bike and gave me a hug. I had to borrow my dad’s car since I don’t have a bike rack, and my car is too small. He said that next time he could pick me up and that mine could probably fit in his car. But we still didn’t exchange #’s (we still only talk on ig). He sent me a photo of the route/distance we went, and I replied “we went far, proud of us!” And he saw it but didn’t reply. I did post a pic on my ig story sat night of me and my (girl) friend. In the recent past when I did a similar pic of us he would like it (I usually don’t post much, or post pics of myself really), but he didn’t like this one. 


It’s only been 3 days since we met up. So I guess not that long. I’m not sure how he sees me. I haven’t reached out since, and am waiting for him to since the ball is in his court.

My BF (30) of 7 years and I (36) are going through a rough patch. 

Yesterday, I stopped by my BF’s house to bring him weekend snacks but found out he wasn’t home. His dad told me, “He has a sleepover with his volleyball friends.” My BF never mentioned that. We are always up to date on where we are or where we are going. From there I figured something is not right.

I called his phone non-stop for 20 minutes but he never answered. When he finally answered, he said he was just at a nearby coffee shop and didn’t notice his phone. I didnt buy that bull$#!T. I asked for his phone but he didn’t give it to me. And that’s when he started to explain. 

He met a lonely guy on Reddit. Offered to pay him money if he can spend a night with him— just a sleepover with a little side action. No penetration. I still didn’t believe that. For money? His family is well off!

We had a long talk about not being sexually compatible. I thought we were good but this issue came out just after 7 years? And now all of a sudden, he is suggesting Open Relationship.

It’s all BS from my point of view but after our long talk, we both agreed we still love each other and we need to fix our trust and sexual incompatibility issue. We are now on a pause as I needed space from him. The whole time I thought we were good. We’re both loving, caring, clingy, and affectionate with each other. We share a 4-year old dog.

I met a girl (A) at work and we ended up hanging out outside of work the other day with another coworker (B). Girl (A) was very touchy and did and said things that weren't ""normal"" in my eyes. She cleaned her glasses using my jumper, she touched me subtly over the course of the night until eventually her legs where resting against mine as we were sitting next to each other.

This sounds embarrassing to talk about and the answer is probably so obvious but these situations have never worked out for me because i either never to anything about because i shut down, or eventually realised maybe the girl was interested but by the time i do something about it, i get rejected. Which leaves me even more confused.

Are people generally touchy and flirty like this without romantic intent? Or is she interested in me? I wanted to ask a community as soon as possible this time so i don't keep repeating my reactions and responses to this behaviour.

As for girl B who is also from work, we used to hang out outside of work one on one and i thought we connected very well. She said to me on our first outing outside of work ""i feel like I've known you my whole life"" and planned ""a coffee date"" the following week. But when we went back to work, this were awkward and when i asked if she was still interested in doing something, she asked if she could invite another coworker (funnily enough, turned out to be girl A. But she didn't end up coming along). Girl B also mentioned that we finish each others sentences. So i eventually said i like her and she said she thought this was platonic.

These sorts of situations always leave me paralysed in doing anything because I can never get a clear enough sign (or i do get a clear sign but always miss the moment). I'm always so confused and defeated because i have no idea how to navigate through these moments.

If anyone has any advice, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance 🙏

Gender: Male 
Height/weight: 5, 7 150
No medication, no health issues (besides low VIT D) yearly labs and physical show I’m healthy 
Non smoker 
Issue: possible Vit D toxicity/ HyperCalcemia 

I am latino and originally form the Florida keys. I moved to New England about a decade ago & every-time I got bloodwork done my doctors always said my Vit d was low. 

About a year ago as fall approached I got so scared of how depressed I get in winter so I finally called my doctor who prescribed 50,000iu once a week which i started taking in November. 

When I tell you I have literally never felt so good, brand new, positive, energized- it’s honestly laughable that this whole time it was just that. Anyways I remember reading that you’re not supposed to take such a high dose for so long, so around January I got switched from 50,000iu d2 to 2000iu d3 daily.. Right away I remember noticing a difference (around 2-3 weeks after switching) & feeling sadder/ more insecure which my doctor gaslit me & told me was all in my head. I actually still had 4 doses of the 50,000iu and I ended up taking them bc my low mood (which lasted one more month) before getting worried and finally getting my levels tested which were at 70. My doctor said to just stop taking it altogether bc that’s in the upper range. Which I did for about 5-6weeks, but like clockwork, around 3 week mark I start feeling sad, melancholic, insecure & familiarly down- like I did before supplementing. 

So I’d decided my levels have probably dropped (it was also rainy spring season & I don’t go outside) so I decided to start the 2000iu maintaining dose bc SAD is no joke. 

Anyways overtime I adjusted, slowly felt normal (possibly due to the arrival of spring as well) but I did notice an uptick in anxiety that gradually increased over the late spring/summer months. 

I work from home and my job can be particularly stressful & it basically peaked in august where I noticed I was having breathlessness at night, depression, and eventually even panic attacks. I assumed it was coffee but then thought it might be vitd. So I stopped that and within 2 days, all anxiety symptoms gone but literally within days I notice lower energy and within 2-3 weeks AGAIN feeling sad and depressed. I get so insecure when I feel this way and I really hate it so I started up again 2000iu after about 5 weeks off & within literally 2 days I felt breathless and panicky. 

I read about magnesium so I bought a supplement with 800iu and 250mg of mag glyc which for one night felt nice, but the second night I took it , breathlessness again! 

I figured okay it’s low mag so I started supplementing with 400mg mag glyc with 2000iu and still breathless which fosters panic attacks… also worth noting even after stopping for over a month, and even after supplementing with mag glyc, 2000iu gave me such tight chest and breathlessness that when on a walk with my friend I genuinely could not catch my breath & felt so winded that I thought I genuinely was having a heart attack. …

I told myself okay clearly I’m so deficient in mag that I need to completely stop and just build it up. Well I then realized my MAGNESIUM gives me breathlessness too? It definitely gives me sedation the next day, but within 30 min of taking it I get slight breathlessness. 

So sorry this is so long but basically. I had to stop taking everything to stop the breathlessness and anxiety. I’m on one week now, and when I don’t take anything around day 2-3 I feel normal (physically). However again and again and again all my metal symptoms come back. I know after all these times it is literally vit d. It works like a serious anti depressant. I have a never in my life been as positive/ clear minded as I am when taking it and doctors have been telling me this for so long. I get so scared I’m just going to have to deal with being so ridiculously depressed & insecure when I am not normally like this. (Even my friends and fam are shocked at my metal symptoms self esteem bc usually I’m never like that)

So my main question is, can vit d actually cause a mini withdrawal? Do I just require higher vit d levels being latino & from Florida keys where I would naturally get far more sun? If my mag is giving me slight breathlessness too, could it just be hypercalcemia instead? I’m genuinely so tired of the back and forth but this low mood & low self image is affecting my job and it is directly correlated with my vit d intake.. has anyone else stopped and will my mood eventually go back to normal (like withdrawal) ? Should I just try a much lower does of vit d? I’m on one week right now & while I can breath, I have no motivation, it’s a butch getting up in the morning, brain fog, & I need like 3x the amount of coffee to function. Last note, what solidified vit d being the cause for sure is my sad mood hits like a bus right at sunset… clearly telling me my levels have dropped. 

Please help if anyone can relate or what I should do, I never thought my dumb ahh would somehow get addicted to vit d lmaoo ",1,1728315874.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Chicago never truly sleeps, and it was common to see people still moving around the streets, even as the clock ticked past midnight. My apartment was just a few blocks away, and I’d made this walk home more times than I could count. The night was cool, the streetlights buzzing softly overhead as I made my way down the familiar route.

There wasn’t much traffic, which was typical for this time of night. The occasional car would pass, and sometimes I could hear the distant hum of the L train. I checked my phone out of habit, scrolling through notifications without really paying attention to them. A message from a friend asking about plans for the weekend, a reminder about a bill due tomorrow . Just the usual.

As I approached my building, I noticed Tom, my neighbor, outside by the garbage bins. He had a cigarette between his fingers, the glow lighting up his face briefly as he nodded in my direction.

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

The elevator was sluggish as usual, and I found myself staring at the scratched-up panel of buttons. I lived on the fourth floor, and as the elevator crept upward, I glanced back at my phone. More notifications, more things to deal with tomorrow.

When the elevator doors finally opened, I stepped into the quiet hallway. My apartment was at the far end, and I could see a faint light coming from under my door .  I must have left the lamp on when I left earlier. Not unusual. I always forgot little things like that.

But when I reached my door, something caught my attention. The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was barely noticeable, just a fraction of an inch, but it was enough to make me stop. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, my hand hovering just above the knob.

I reached for the door, but as I grasped the knob, I froze. The door was unlocked. I was sure I had locked it before leaving, as I always did. I stood there, staring at the knob, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had been in such a hurry earlier that I forgot. But no, I distinctly remembered the click of the lock as I left.

A knot tightened in my stomach as I pushed the door open. The apartment was quiet, everything seemingly in its place. The small lamp in the living room cast a soft glow, illuminating the familiar surroundings. I stepped inside and locked the door behind me, twisting the lock back and forth as if to reassure myself that it was working properly.

I walked into the living room, tossing my keys onto the counter, and that’s when I saw it. Lying on the coffee table, where nothing had been earlier, was a photograph. My breath caught in my throat. I didn’t remember leaving it there, and more importantly, I didn’t own any printed photos.

I stepped closer, my heart thudding in my chest. The photo was of me. Taken earlier today, on my walk from work. I recognized the street, the same one I had walked down just hours ago. My hand trembled as I picked it up, flipping it over to see if there was anything written on the back. There wasn’t.

Whoever took this photo had been watching me. They had followed me, and now they had been inside my apartment.

I felt a rush of adrenaline, my mind racing with questions. How did they get in? Had I really left the door unlocked? I didn’t think so. I quickly scanned the room again, looking for anything else that might have been moved, but everything seemed in place. I checked the windows, but they were locked too.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from the stalker, but it was just Tom, my neighbor.

“Hey, you okay? You looked kind of off earlier,” his message read.

I stared at the screen, my thoughts too scattered to reply right away. Tom had been outside when I came home. Could he have noticed something? Should I tell him about the photo?

I hesitated for a moment, staring at Tom’s message. Should I tell him about the photo? Part of me wanted to confide in someone, but another part felt like I needed to keep it to myself, at least for now. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, and jumping to conclusions didn’t feel right.

After a long pause, I typed out a quick reply: “Yeah, just a rough day at work. Thanks for checking in.”

I put my phone down, running my hand through my hair as I tried to steady my breathing. The photo still sat on the table, taunting me. My mind raced, thinking through all the possibilities. Who had taken it? Why leave it here? How did they get in?

Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, hoping that some background noise would help calm my nerves. But I couldn’t focus. My thoughts kept circling back to the unlocked door and the photo. It was almost like someone wanted me to know I was being watched . Someone who knew I’d come home tonight and find their little message.

I stood up and walked around the apartment, checking the windows again, though I knew they were already locked. My eyes wandered over every corner of the room, looking for anything else out of place. Nothing. Just that photo.

The buzz of my phone startled me again. Another message from Tom.

“If you need anything, let me know. I’m up for a while.”

I stared at the message, feeling uneasy. Tom had always been friendly, but now it seemed like he was paying extra attention. I hadn’t noticed it before, but maybe I had never looked for it. Was I overthinking things? Or was it just a coincidence that he was always nearby, always checking in at the right time?

I didn’t respond to his message. Instead, I paced the room, glancing at the clock. It was past midnight now, and sleep felt impossible. My mind kept going over the day, trying to remember if I had seen anyone suspicious, anyone who might have followed me.

Suddenly, a soft knock came at the door.

The knock at the door sent a jolt through my body. I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour. I hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I tiptoed toward the peephole. It was Tom, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking casual. For a brief second, I felt relieved. Then, I remembered the photo on the coffee table and the unlocked door. My nerves tightened again.

I opened the door just a crack, trying to keep my voice steady. “Hey, what’s up?”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Sorry to bother you. I thought I heard something strange, like someone messing with your door earlier. Just wanted to check in, make sure you’re okay.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “You heard someone?”

“Yeah, probably just some drunk or something, but it didn’t seem right,” Tom continued, his eyes flicking past me into the apartment. “Thought I’d make sure everything was cool.”

My hand gripped the edge of the door tighter. I wasn’t sure what to make of this. Tom had always been friendly, but the timing of his concern felt off. And if he had really heard something, why hadn’t he called me or knocked earlier?

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, trying to close the door a bit more. “Thanks for checking in.”

Tom’s smile faltered just a bit. “Okay, well… just let me know if you need anything.”

I nodded, forcing a smile before closing the door fully and locking it. As soon as I was alone again, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right with me. I glanced back at the photo on the table, the reminder of someone having been inside, watching me.

My phone buzzed again, and I nearly jumped. Another message from Tom.

“Sorry if I freaked you out. Just being a good neighbor.”

I stared at the message, feeling my skin crawl. He was being too attentive, too involved. It was hard not to connect the dots. First the unlocked door, then the photo, and now Tom always seeming to be around at the perfect moment. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on.

I decided I needed to talk to someone, so I called my friend Sarah. As the phone rang, I paced around the living room, my mind still racing. When she finally answered, her voice was groggy.

“Hey… everything okay?” she asked, clearly half-asleep.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something weird’s been happening. Someone was in my apartment earlier, I think. They left a photo of me from today.”

There was a pause on the other end before Sarah spoke again. “That’s creepy. Did you call the police?”

“I’m not sure what to tell them.. and I…” I stopped mid-sentence, glancing at the coffee table again, where the photo still sat. It felt like it was staring back at me, an eerie reminder that someone had been close enough to take it. “I don’t even know what to say. What if they think I’m just overreacting?”

Sarah’s voice grew more alert. “You’re not overreacting. Someone took a photo of you and left it in your apartment. That’s serious. You need to call them.”

I bit my lip, considering it. “Maybe you’re right. But… it’s just so bizarre. And Tom keeps checking on me. It’s like he knows something, but I don’t know if I’m being paranoid.”

“Wait, Tom?” Sarah asked, confused. “Your neighbor?”

“Yeah,” I said, lowering my voice even though I was alone. “He’s been around every time something weird happens. He texted me just after I found the photo, said he saw someone hanging around my door. It’s almost like he’s watching me.”

“Okay, that’s weird. Do you think he could be involved?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, glancing nervously at the front door. “He’s always been friendly, but now it feels… off. I don’t know what to think.”

Sarah sighed. “Look, I really think you should call the police. Even if it’s nothing, better safe than sorry. And maybe keep your distance from Tom for a bit. Just in case.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah, maybe I’ll do that. Thanks, Sarah.”

“Stay safe, okay?” she said, her voice a little softer now. “Call me if you need anything.”

After hanging up with Sarah, I sat in the silence for a long moment… but she was right. It was better to be safe than sorry.

I dialed the non-emergency number, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I waited for them to pick up. When I finally spoke, my voice sounded smaller than I intended.

“I’d like to report something suspicious,” I said, trying to keep my tone steady. “I think someone’s been watching me… and maybe even inside my apartment.”

The dispatcher took down my information, asking for the details of what had happened with the photos and the sounds outside my door. I tried my best to explain, though it felt surreal even as the words left my mouth. By the time the call ended, they assured me that an officer would be dispatched to check things out.

It wasn’t long before I heard the knock at the door. My heart jumped, but when I checked the peephole, I saw the distinct navy-blue uniforms of two police officers standing just outside. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and let them inside.

One of the officers, a tall man with tired eyes, introduced himself. “Ma’am, we’re here to follow up on your report. Mind if we ask a few questions?”

I nodded, still feeling uneasy despite their presence. I led them into the living room, where they asked me to go over the events again in more detail. As I described the photos, the unlocked door, and the eerie feeling that I was being followed, the officer took notes, his partner occasionally glancing around the apartment.

“Have you noticed anyone suspicious hanging around recently?” the officer asked.

I hesitated. “There’s my neighbor, Tom. He’s been really helpful, but… I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. He’s always around, checking on me, and it seems a little too convenient.”

The officer nodded, his expression unreadable. “We’ll talk to him. Just to cover all the bases.”

After I finished explaining everything, they went down the hall to speak with Tom. I stayed inside, pacing nervously, listening to the muffled conversation through the door. It wasn’t long before the officers returned.

“Your neighbor says he hasn’t noticed anything unusual, but he’s concerned for your safety,” the officer said, his voice calm. “He offered to keep an eye out for anything strange.”

I nodded, not sure if that made me feel better or worse.

“Look, we don’t have enough for a full investigation right now,” the officer continued, “but we’ll keep a patrol car parked outside tonight, just in case. You should try to get some rest.”

I thanked them, feeling a slight sense of relief at the idea of police nearby. Maybe now, with someone watching over the apartment, I could get some rest.

I couldn’t sleep. The events of the night replayed in my mind, the unsettling photos, the noises outside my door, and Tom’s messages. The fear settled in deep, keeping me alert, despite the police being outside. I stayed up all night, jumping at every creak in the apartment, every distant sound from the street. The small knife I had tucked into my bag for protection felt like my only source of comfort as dawn finally broke.

The next day passed in a haze of routine, but the weight of the previous night’s fear lingered at the back of my mind. I went through my workday mechanically, my body tired but my thoughts racing. By the time I finished my shift, the sky had already darkened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over me.

As I made my way home, I decided to stop by the convenience store a few blocks from my apartment. I needed something to help me unwind, maybe a snack and a drink to go with the movie I’d planned to watch. The store was brightly lit, a small beacon of normalcy amidst the growing shadows of the evening.

I walked inside, the sound of the automatic doors hissing as they slid open. Grabbing a soda and a bag of chips, I wandered toward the counter, trying to shake the nerves that still clung to me.

The cold night air felt sharp against my skin as I left the convenience store, clutching the plastic bag of snacks. Ever since I found those photos in my apartment, my nerves had been on edge. I kept one hand near the knife in my jacket pocket as I walked quickly through the dimly lit parking lot. Something didn’t feel right, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

The parking lot felt unnervingly still, the flickering streetlights casting long, distorted shadows over the scattered cars. The silence pressed in around me, broken only by the faint hum of the lights overhead. I quickened my pace, the sound of my own footsteps loud and uneven. My breath hitched, and I glanced back, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was no one.

My heart pounded harder, every instinct screaming at me to move faster. The shadows felt like they were closing in, stretching farther across the pavement as I hurried toward the far end of the lot. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, just the leftover fear from the night before .

Then, everything went dark. A bag was yanked over my head with brutal force, and strong arms wrapped around my throat, squeezing tight. Panic surged through me as I thrashed wildly, trying to scream, but the sound was muffled by the bag, my voice trapped inside. My lungs burned, desperate for air, but each breath came in shallow, choking gasps.

The grip around my throat tightened, and my vision started to blur. My legs kicked out violently, but I couldn’t break free. Every muscle in my body screamed for oxygen, for a way out, but the world around me was fading, slipping into darkness. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

My hand fumbled toward my pocket, feeling the cold steel of the knife. With the last ounce of strength I had left, I yanked it free and swung blindly behind me. I felt the blade hit flesh, and a low grunt of pain followed. The grip on my throat loosened just enough for me to rip the bag from my head.

I gasped for air, stumbling forward, vision swimming as I tried to regain my balance. My entire body trembled with fear and adrenaline, but I forced myself to turn around. He stood there, hunched over, clutching his side where I had slashed him. Blood poured between his fingers, staining the pavement beneath him, but his eyes… his eyes were locked on me with a burning hatred.

""Who are you?""I rasped, my voice shaking, barely able to speak.

His twisted grin sent a shiver down my spine. ""You don’t remember me?"" he said, his voice low, full of contempt. ""Of course you don’t.""

I stared at him, struggling to place his face. There was something familiar about him, but it was like grasping at a half-forgotten memory.

""You think you’re so much better than me,"" he hissed, taking a shaky step forward despite the wound.

""You never even looked at me back then. You laughed, like I didn’t matter.""

The memory hit me like a cold wave. High school. He had been there, always lurking in the background, quiet, unassuming . Someone I had barely noticed. I swallowed hard, dread settling deep in my chest.

""You,"" I whispered, feeling a rising sense of horror. ""I barely remember you.""

“You rejected me, like I was nothing."" He took another step, his breath ragged. ""But I swore you’d pay for it one day.""

My pulse raced as his words sank in. This wasn’t just some random attack. He had planned this. He had been waiting for this moment, fueled by a hatred I hadn’t even known existed.

""I didn’t want your love,"" he said, his voice trembling with anger. ""I wanted you to feel what it’s like to be nothing. To feel hunted. To feel powerless.""

I backed away, my heart pounding against my chest. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""That was years ago.""

His face contorted with rage. ""You thought you could laugh at me and walk away. But I’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting all this time to make you suffer.""

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him as his breath came in shallow gasps. I stood there, paralyzed, watching him struggle to breathe, trying to comprehend the nightmare that had unfolded in front of me. A boy I barely remembered from my past had plotted his revenge for years, and now he had come for me.

Then, I heard it . The soft chime of a text message.

My pulse quickened as I looked down at his limp body. His phone must have gone off. My hands shook as I crouched down, reaching toward his jacket pocket. For a moment, I hesitated, but then I forced my hand inside.

I pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing with a new notification.

The message read: ""Did you get the job done?""

I opened the conversation and what I saw made my blood freeze .

There were photos of me : walking to work, leaving my apartment, moving through my daily life. He

had been watching me for weeks, maybe longer. Each photo was sent to him with a chilling, calculated precision.

My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I scrolled up further. The stalker had been communicating with someone else, someone who had been helping him all along. My blood ran cold as I read through the exchange.

""Make sure she finds the pictures.""

""Tonight’s the night. I’m going to finish this.""

Then came the reply from earlier that night: ""I don’t care what you do, as long as I get paid.""

With growing terror, I pulled out my own phone and compared the unknown number to my contacts. My hands shook violently as I scrolled through my list, praying I was wrong. But when I saw the match, my heart plummeted.

It was Tom...

A wave of nausea hit me as the realization set in. Tom, the friendly neighbor who had always been so concerned, so helpful, had been involved from the beginning. He had been feeding information to my stalker, planting the photos, manipulating me . All for money.

I felt numb as I dialed the police, my voice shaking as I tried to explain everything. Tom had betrayed me in the worst possible way, and I had never even suspected him.

It didn’t take long. A knock at Tom’s door echoed through the hallway, louder than I’d ever heard before. I stepped out into the corridor, standing in the shadows as the police spoke to him. I held my breath as I watched the scene unfold.

Tom opened the door, calm as ever, his face the picture of confusion. ""What’s going on?"" he asked, his voice dripping with faux innocence.

They moved swiftly, stepping inside. Within moments, Tom was in handcuffs, his calm facade cracking ever so slightly. His eyes locked onto mine, just for a second, as they led him past me down the hallway.

""You were always so easy to fool,"" he said, his voice low, cold, and with a grim smirk on his face.

How could I have been so blind? He had been right there, pretending to care, pulling the strings the entire time.

As I sat in my apartment, alone and shaken, I realized how close I had come to losing everything . Not just my life, but my sense of trust. I thought I had known who the real danger was, but the truth had been right in front of me the whole time, hidden behind a [neighbor’s smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeRkJGurY8).",1,1728315806.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

Chicago never truly sleeps, and it was common to see people still moving around the streets, even as the clock ticked past midnight. My apartment was just a few blocks away, and I’d made this walk home more times than I could count. The night was cool, the streetlights buzzing softly overhead as I made my way down the familiar route.

There wasn’t much traffic, which was typical for this time of night. The occasional car would pass, and sometimes I could hear the distant hum of the L train. I checked my phone out of habit, scrolling through notifications without really paying attention to them. A message from a friend asking about plans for the weekend, a reminder about a bill due tomorrow . Just the usual.

As I approached my building, I noticed Tom, my neighbor, outside by the garbage bins. He had a cigarette between his fingers, the glow lighting up his face briefly as he nodded in my direction.

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

One of the officers, a tall man with tired eyes, introduced himself. “Ma’am, we’re here to follow up on your report. Mind if we ask a few questions?”

I nodded, still feeling uneasy despite their presence. I led them into the living room, where they asked me to go over the events again in more detail. As I described the photos, the unlocked door, and the eerie feeling that I was being followed, the officer took notes, his partner occasionally glancing around the apartment.

“Have you noticed anyone suspicious hanging around recently?” the officer asked.

I hesitated. “There’s my neighbor, Tom. He’s been really helpful, but… I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. He’s always around, checking on me, and it seems a little too convenient.”

The officer nodded, his expression unreadable. “We’ll talk to him. Just to cover all the bases.”

After I finished explaining everything, they went down the hall to speak with Tom. I stayed inside, pacing nervously, listening to the muffled conversation through the door. It wasn’t long before the officers returned.

“Your neighbor says he hasn’t noticed anything unusual, but he’s concerned for your safety,” the officer said, his voice calm. “He offered to keep an eye out for anything strange.”

I nodded, not sure if that made me feel better or worse.

“Look, we don’t have enough for a full investigation right now,” the officer continued, “but we’ll keep a patrol car parked outside tonight, just in case. You should try to get some rest.”

I thanked them, feeling a slight sense of relief at the idea of police nearby. Maybe now, with someone watching over the apartment, I could get some rest.

I couldn’t sleep. The events of the night replayed in my mind, the unsettling photos, the noises outside my door, and Tom’s messages. The fear settled in deep, keeping me alert, despite the police being outside. I stayed up all night, jumping at every creak in the apartment, every distant sound from the street. The small knife I had tucked into my bag for protection felt like my only source of comfort as dawn finally broke.

The next day passed in a haze of routine, but the weight of the previous night’s fear lingered at the back of my mind. I went through my workday mechanically, my body tired but my thoughts racing. By the time I finished my shift, the sky had already darkened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over me.

As I made my way home, I decided to stop by the convenience store a few blocks from my apartment. I needed something to help me unwind, maybe a snack and a drink to go with the movie I’d planned to watch. The store was brightly lit, a small beacon of normalcy amidst the growing shadows of the evening.

I walked inside, the sound of the automatic doors hissing as they slid open. Grabbing a soda and a bag of chips, I wandered toward the counter, trying to shake the nerves that still clung to me.

The cold night air felt sharp against my skin as I left the convenience store, clutching the plastic bag of snacks. Ever since I found those photos in my apartment, my nerves had been on edge. I kept one hand near the knife in my jacket pocket as I walked quickly through the dimly lit parking lot. Something didn’t feel right, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

The parking lot felt unnervingly still, the flickering streetlights casting long, distorted shadows over the scattered cars. The silence pressed in around me, broken only by the faint hum of the lights overhead. I quickened my pace, the sound of my own footsteps loud and uneven. My breath hitched, and I glanced back, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was no one.

My heart pounded harder, every instinct screaming at me to move faster. The shadows felt like they were closing in, stretching farther across the pavement as I hurried toward the far end of the lot. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, just the leftover fear from the night before .

Then, everything went dark. A bag was yanked over my head with brutal force, and strong arms wrapped around my throat, squeezing tight. Panic surged through me as I thrashed wildly, trying to scream, but the sound was muffled by the bag, my voice trapped inside. My lungs burned, desperate for air, but each breath came in shallow, choking gasps.

The grip around my throat tightened, and my vision started to blur. My legs kicked out violently, but I couldn’t break free. Every muscle in my body screamed for oxygen, for a way out, but the world around me was fading, slipping into darkness. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

My hand fumbled toward my pocket, feeling the cold steel of the knife. With the last ounce of strength I had left, I yanked it free and swung blindly behind me. I felt the blade hit flesh, and a low grunt of pain followed. The grip on my throat loosened just enough for me to rip the bag from my head.

I gasped for air, stumbling forward, vision swimming as I tried to regain my balance. My entire body trembled with fear and adrenaline, but I forced myself to turn around. He stood there, hunched over, clutching his side where I had slashed him. Blood poured between his fingers, staining the pavement beneath him, but his eyes… his eyes were locked on me with a burning hatred.

""Who are you?""I rasped, my voice shaking, barely able to speak.

His twisted grin sent a shiver down my spine. ""You don’t remember me?"" he said, his voice low, full of contempt. ""Of course you don’t.""

I stared at him, struggling to place his face. There was something familiar about him, but it was like grasping at a half-forgotten memory.

""You think you’re so much better than me,"" he hissed, taking a shaky step forward despite the wound.

""You never even looked at me back then. You laughed, like I didn’t matter.""

The memory hit me like a cold wave. High school. He had been there, always lurking in the background, quiet, unassuming . Someone I had barely noticed. I swallowed hard, dread settling deep in my chest.

""You,"" I whispered, feeling a rising sense of horror. ""I barely remember you.""

“You rejected me, like I was nothing."" He took another step, his breath ragged. ""But I swore you’d pay for it one day.""

My pulse raced as his words sank in. This wasn’t just some random attack. He had planned this. He had been waiting for this moment, fueled by a hatred I hadn’t even known existed.

""I didn’t want your love,"" he said, his voice trembling with anger. ""I wanted you to feel what it’s like to be nothing. To feel hunted. To feel powerless.""

I backed away, my heart pounding against my chest. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""That was years ago.""

His face contorted with rage. ""You thought you could laugh at me and walk away. But I’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting all this time to make you suffer.""

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him as his breath came in shallow gasps. I stood there, paralyzed, watching him struggle to breathe, trying to comprehend the nightmare that had unfolded in front of me. A boy I barely remembered from my past had plotted his revenge for years, and now he had come for me.

Then, I heard it . The soft chime of a text message.

My pulse quickened as I looked down at his limp body. His phone must have gone off. My hands shook as I crouched down, reaching toward his jacket pocket. For a moment, I hesitated, but then I forced my hand inside.

I pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing with a new notification.

The message read: ""Did you get the job done?""

I opened the conversation and what I saw made my blood freeze .

There were photos of me : walking to work, leaving my apartment, moving through my daily life. He

had been watching me for weeks, maybe longer. Each photo was sent to him with a chilling, calculated precision.

My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I scrolled up further. The stalker had been communicating with someone else, someone who had been helping him all along. My blood ran cold as I read through the exchange.

""Make sure she finds the pictures.""

""Tonight’s the night. I’m going to finish this.""

Then came the reply from earlier that night: ""I don’t care what you do, as long as I get paid.""

With growing terror, I pulled out my own phone and compared the unknown number to my contacts. My hands shook violently as I scrolled through my list, praying I was wrong. But when I saw the match, my heart plummeted.

It was Tom...

A wave of nausea hit me as the realization set in. Tom, the friendly neighbor who had always been so concerned, so helpful, had been involved from the beginning. He had been feeding information to my stalker, planting the photos, manipulating me . All for money.

I felt numb as I dialed the police, my voice shaking as I tried to explain everything. Tom had betrayed me in the worst possible way, and I had never even suspected him.

It didn’t take long. A knock at Tom’s door echoed through the hallway, louder than I’d ever heard before. I stepped out into the corridor, standing in the shadows as the police spoke to him. I held my breath as I watched the scene unfold.

Tom opened the door, calm as ever, his face the picture of confusion. ""What’s going on?"" he asked, his voice dripping with faux innocence.

They moved swiftly, stepping inside. Within moments, Tom was in handcuffs, his calm facade cracking ever so slightly. His eyes locked onto mine, just for a second, as they led him past me down the hallway.

""You were always so easy to fool,"" he said, his voice low, cold, and with a grim smirk on his face.

How could I have been so blind? He had been right there, pretending to care, pulling the strings the entire time.

As I sat in my apartment, alone and shaken, I realized how close I had come to losing everything . Not just my life, but my sense of trust. I thought I had known who the real danger was, but the truth had been right in front of me the whole time, hidden behind a [neighbor’s smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeRkJGurY8).",2,1728315768.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False
1fyaqxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Horror_stories/comments/1fyaqxr/my_neighbor_has_been_too_friendly_lately/,My neighbor has been too friendly lately..,"I had been working late again, something I’d grown used to over the past few months. Chicago never truly sleeps, and it was common to see people still moving around the streets, even as the clock ticked past midnight. My apartment was just a few blocks away, and I’d made this walk home more times than I could count. The night was cool, the streetlights buzzing softly overhead as I made my way down the familiar route.

There wasn’t much traffic, which was typical for this time of night. The occasional car would pass, and sometimes I could hear the distant hum of the L train. I checked my phone out of habit, scrolling through notifications without really paying attention to them. A message from a friend asking about plans for the weekend, a reminder about a bill due tomorrow . Just the usual.

As I approached my building, I noticed Tom, my neighbor, outside by the garbage bins. He had a cigarette between his fingers, the glow lighting up his face briefly as he nodded in my direction.

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

The elevator was sluggish as usual, and I found myself staring at the scratched-up panel of buttons. I lived on the fourth floor, and as the elevator crept upward, I glanced back at my phone. More notifications, more things to deal with tomorrow.

When the elevator doors finally opened, I stepped into the quiet hallway. My apartment was at the far end, and I could see a faint light coming from under my door .  I must have left the lamp on when I left earlier. Not unusual. I always forgot little things like that.

But when I reached my door, something caught my attention. The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was barely noticeable, just a fraction of an inch, but it was enough to make me stop. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, my hand hovering just above the knob.

I reached for the door, but as I grasped the knob, I froze. The door was unlocked. I was sure I had locked it before leaving, as I always did. I stood there, staring at the knob, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had been in such a hurry earlier that I forgot. But no, I distinctly remembered the click of the lock as I left.

A knot tightened in my stomach as I pushed the door open. The apartment was quiet, everything seemingly in its place. The small lamp in the living room cast a soft glow, illuminating the familiar surroundings. I stepped inside and locked the door behind me, twisting the lock back and forth as if to reassure myself that it was working properly.

I walked into the living room, tossing my keys onto the counter, and that’s when I saw it. Lying on the coffee table, where nothing had been earlier, was a photograph. My breath caught in my throat. I didn’t remember leaving it there, and more importantly, I didn’t own any printed photos.

I stepped closer, my heart thudding in my chest. The photo was of me. Taken earlier today, on my walk from work. I recognized the street, the same one I had walked down just hours ago. My hand trembled as I picked it up, flipping it over to see if there was anything written on the back. There wasn’t.

Whoever took this photo had been watching me. They had followed me, and now they had been inside my apartment.

I felt a rush of adrenaline, my mind racing with questions. How did they get in? Had I really left the door unlocked? I didn’t think so. I quickly scanned the room again, looking for anything else that might have been moved, but everything seemed in place. I checked the windows, but they were locked too.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from the stalker, but it was just Tom, my neighbor.

“Hey, you okay? You looked kind of off earlier,” his message read.

I stared at the screen, my thoughts too scattered to reply right away. Tom had been outside when I came home. Could he have noticed something? Should I tell him about the photo?

I hesitated for a moment, staring at Tom’s message. Should I tell him about the photo? Part of me wanted to confide in someone, but another part felt like I needed to keep it to myself, at least for now. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, and jumping to conclusions didn’t feel right.

After a long pause, I typed out a quick reply: “Yeah, just a rough day at work. Thanks for checking in.”

I put my phone down, running my hand through my hair as I tried to steady my breathing. The photo still sat on the table, taunting me. My mind raced, thinking through all the possibilities. Who had taken it? Why leave it here? How did they get in?

Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, hoping that some background noise would help calm my nerves. But I couldn’t focus. My thoughts kept circling back to the unlocked door and the photo. It was almost like someone wanted me to know I was being watched . Someone who knew I’d come home tonight and find their little message.

I stood up and walked around the apartment, checking the windows again, though I knew they were already locked. My eyes wandered over every corner of the room, looking for anything else out of place. Nothing. Just that photo.

The buzz of my phone startled me again. Another message from Tom.

“If you need anything, let me know. I’m up for a while.”

I stared at the message, feeling uneasy. Tom had always been friendly, but now it seemed like he was paying extra attention. I hadn’t noticed it before, but maybe I had never looked for it. Was I overthinking things? Or was it just a coincidence that he was always nearby, always checking in at the right time?

I didn’t respond to his message. Instead, I paced the room, glancing at the clock. It was past midnight now, and sleep felt impossible. My mind kept going over the day, trying to remember if I had seen anyone suspicious, anyone who might have followed me.

Suddenly, a soft knock came at the door.

The knock at the door sent a jolt through my body. I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour. I hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I tiptoed toward the peephole. It was Tom, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking casual. For a brief second, I felt relieved. Then, I remembered the photo on the coffee table and the unlocked door. My nerves tightened again.

I opened the door just a crack, trying to keep my voice steady. “Hey, what’s up?”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Sorry to bother you. I thought I heard something strange, like someone messing with your door earlier. Just wanted to check in, make sure you’re okay.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “You heard someone?”

“Yeah, probably just some drunk or something, but it didn’t seem right,” Tom continued, his eyes flicking past me into the apartment. “Thought I’d make sure everything was cool.”

My hand gripped the edge of the door tighter. I wasn’t sure what to make of this. Tom had always been friendly, but the timing of his concern felt off. And if he had really heard something, why hadn’t he called me or knocked earlier?

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, trying to close the door a bit more. “Thanks for checking in.”

Tom’s smile faltered just a bit. “Okay, well… just let me know if you need anything.”

I nodded, forcing a smile before closing the door fully and locking it. As soon as I was alone again, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right with me. I glanced back at the photo on the table, the reminder of someone having been inside, watching me.

My phone buzzed again, and I nearly jumped. Another message from Tom.

“Sorry if I freaked you out. Just being a good neighbor.”

I stared at the message, feeling my skin crawl. He was being too attentive, too involved. It was hard not to connect the dots. First the unlocked door, then the photo, and now Tom always seeming to be around at the perfect moment. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on.

I decided I needed to talk to someone, so I called my friend Sarah. As the phone rang, I paced around the living room, my mind still racing. When she finally answered, her voice was groggy.

“Hey… everything okay?” she asked, clearly half-asleep.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something weird’s been happening. Someone was in my apartment earlier, I think. They left a photo of me from today.”

There was a pause on the other end before Sarah spoke again. “That’s creepy. Did you call the police?”

“I’m not sure what to tell them.. and I…” I stopped mid-sentence, glancing at the coffee table again, where the photo still sat. It felt like it was staring back at me, an eerie reminder that someone had been close enough to take it. “I don’t even know what to say. What if they think I’m just overreacting?”

Sarah’s voice grew more alert. “You’re not overreacting. Someone took a photo of you and left it in your apartment. That’s serious. You need to call them.”

I bit my lip, considering it. “Maybe you’re right. But… it’s just so bizarre. And Tom keeps checking on me. It’s like he knows something, but I don’t know if I’m being paranoid.”

“Wait, Tom?” Sarah asked, confused. “Your neighbor?”

“Yeah,” I said, lowering my voice even though I was alone. “He’s been around every time something weird happens. He texted me just after I found the photo, said he saw someone hanging around my door. It’s almost like he’s watching me.”

“Okay, that’s weird. Do you think he could be involved?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, glancing nervously at the front door. “He’s always been friendly, but now it feels… off. I don’t know what to think.”

Sarah sighed. “Look, I really think you should call the police. Even if it’s nothing, better safe than sorry. And maybe keep your distance from Tom for a bit. Just in case.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah, maybe I’ll do that. Thanks, Sarah.”

“Stay safe, okay?” she said, her voice a little softer now. “Call me if you need anything.”

After hanging up with Sarah, I sat in the silence for a long moment… but she was right. It was better to be safe than sorry.

I dialed the non-emergency number, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I waited for them to pick up. When I finally spoke, my voice sounded smaller than I intended.

“I’d like to report something suspicious,” I said, trying to keep my tone steady. “I think someone’s been watching me… and maybe even inside my apartment.”

The dispatcher took down my information, asking for the details of what had happened with the photos and the sounds outside my door. I tried my best to explain, though it felt surreal even as the words left my mouth. By the time the call ended, they assured me that an officer would be dispatched to check things out.

It wasn’t long before I heard the knock at the door. My heart jumped, but when I checked the peephole, I saw the distinct navy-blue uniforms of two police officers standing just outside. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and let them inside.

I’m already going to build a new PC this holiday season for 4K gaming/movie/show watching and also animation rendering since I’ve recently gotten into Blender and Daz as a hobby.

However, a lot of the set up I do before rendering on Blender and Daz is sculpting, rigging, painting, and posing, stuff that doesn’t need a 4K gaming PC to do. 

This the kinda stuff I would like to do on-the-go like at coffee shops or at work during lunch breaks, so I’m looking into laptops that are capable of doing just that and low quality renders for testing while my 4K rig does the 4K rendering.

But I’ve been exclusively just desktop and only owned two cheap laptops for high school and college so I know next to nothing about them.

1fyaq9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1fyaq9s/my_neighbor_has_been_too_friendly_lately/,My neighbor has been too friendly lately..,"I had been working late again, something I’d grown used to over the past few months. Chicago never truly sleeps, and it was common to see people still moving around the streets, even as the clock ticked past midnight. My apartment was just a few blocks away, and I’d made this walk home more times than I could count. The night was cool, the streetlights buzzing softly overhead as I made my way down the familiar route.

There wasn’t much traffic, which was typical for this time of night. The occasional car would pass, and sometimes I could hear the distant hum of the L train. I checked my phone out of habit, scrolling through notifications without really paying attention to them. A message from a friend asking about plans for the weekend, a reminder about a bill due tomorrow . Just the usual.

As I approached my building, I noticed Tom, my neighbor, outside by the garbage bins. He had a cigarette between his fingers, the glow lighting up his face briefly as he nodded in my direction.

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

The elevator was sluggish as usual, and I found myself staring at the scratched-up panel of buttons. I lived on the fourth floor, and as the elevator crept upward, I glanced back at my phone. More notifications, more things to deal with tomorrow.

When the elevator doors finally opened, I stepped into the quiet hallway. My apartment was at the far end, and I could see a faint light coming from under my door .  I must have left the lamp on when I left earlier. Not unusual. I always forgot little things like that.

But when I reached my door, something caught my attention. The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was barely noticeable, just a fraction of an inch, but it was enough to make me stop. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, my hand hovering just above the knob.

I reached for the door, but as I grasped the knob, I froze. The door was unlocked. I was sure I had locked it before leaving, as I always did. I stood there, staring at the knob, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had been in such a hurry earlier that I forgot. But no, I distinctly remembered the click of the lock as I left.

A knot tightened in my stomach as I pushed the door open. The apartment was quiet, everything seemingly in its place. The small lamp in the living room cast a soft glow, illuminating the familiar surroundings. I stepped inside and locked the door behind me, twisting the lock back and forth as if to reassure myself that it was working properly.

I walked into the living room, tossing my keys onto the counter, and that’s when I saw it. Lying on the coffee table, where nothing had been earlier, was a photograph. My breath caught in my throat. I didn’t remember leaving it there, and more importantly, I didn’t own any printed photos.

I stepped closer, my heart thudding in my chest. The photo was of me. Taken earlier today, on my walk from work. I recognized the street, the same one I had walked down just hours ago. My hand trembled as I picked it up, flipping it over to see if there was anything written on the back. There wasn’t.

Whoever took this photo had been watching me. They had followed me, and now they had been inside my apartment.

I felt a rush of adrenaline, my mind racing with questions. How did they get in? Had I really left the door unlocked? I didn’t think so. I quickly scanned the room again, looking for anything else that might have been moved, but everything seemed in place. I checked the windows, but they were locked too.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from the stalker, but it was just Tom, my neighbor.

“Hey, you okay? You looked kind of off earlier,” his message read.

I stared at the screen, my thoughts too scattered to reply right away. Tom had been outside when I came home. Could he have noticed something? Should I tell him about the photo?

I hesitated for a moment, staring at Tom’s message. Should I tell him about the photo? Part of me wanted to confide in someone, but another part felt like I needed to keep it to myself, at least for now. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, and jumping to conclusions didn’t feel right.

After a long pause, I typed out a quick reply: “Yeah, just a rough day at work. Thanks for checking in.”

I put my phone down, running my hand through my hair as I tried to steady my breathing. The photo still sat on the table, taunting me. My mind raced, thinking through all the possibilities. Who had taken it? Why leave it here? How did they get in?

Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, hoping that some background noise would help calm my nerves. But I couldn’t focus. My thoughts kept circling back to the unlocked door and the photo. It was almost like someone wanted me to know I was being watched . Someone who knew I’d come home tonight and find their little message.

I stood up and walked around the apartment, checking the windows again, though I knew they were already locked. My eyes wandered over every corner of the room, looking for anything else out of place. Nothing. Just that photo.

The buzz of my phone startled me again. Another message from Tom.

“If you need anything, let me know. I’m up for a while.”

I stared at the message, feeling uneasy. Tom had always been friendly, but now it seemed like he was paying extra attention. I hadn’t noticed it before, but maybe I had never looked for it. Was I overthinking things? Or was it just a coincidence that he was always nearby, always checking in at the right time?

I didn’t respond to his message. Instead, I paced the room, glancing at the clock. It was past midnight now, and sleep felt impossible. My mind kept going over the day, trying to remember if I had seen anyone suspicious, anyone who might have followed me.

Suddenly, a soft knock came at the door.

The knock at the door sent a jolt through my body. I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour. I hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I tiptoed toward the peephole. It was Tom, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking casual. For a brief second, I felt relieved. Then, I remembered the photo on the coffee table and the unlocked door. My nerves tightened again.

I opened the door just a crack, trying to keep my voice steady. “Hey, what’s up?”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Sorry to bother you. I thought I heard something strange, like someone messing with your door earlier. Just wanted to check in, make sure you’re okay.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “You heard someone?”

“Yeah, probably just some drunk or something, but it didn’t seem right,” Tom continued, his eyes flicking past me into the apartment. “Thought I’d make sure everything was cool.”

My hand gripped the edge of the door tighter. I wasn’t sure what to make of this. Tom had always been friendly, but the timing of his concern felt off. And if he had really heard something, why hadn’t he called me or knocked earlier?

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, trying to close the door a bit more. “Thanks for checking in.”

Tom’s smile faltered just a bit. “Okay, well… just let me know if you need anything.”

I nodded, forcing a smile before closing the door fully and locking it. As soon as I was alone again, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right with me. I glanced back at the photo on the table, the reminder of someone having been inside, watching me.

My phone buzzed again, and I nearly jumped. Another message from Tom.

“Sorry if I freaked you out. Just being a good neighbor.”

I stared at the message, feeling my skin crawl. He was being too attentive, too involved. It was hard not to connect the dots. First the unlocked door, then the photo, and now Tom always seeming to be around at the perfect moment. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on.

I decided I needed to talk to someone, so I called my friend Sarah. As the phone rang, I paced around the living room, my mind still racing. When she finally answered, her voice was groggy.

“Hey… everything okay?” she asked, clearly half-asleep.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something weird’s been happening. Someone was in my apartment earlier, I think. They left a photo of me from today.”

There was a pause on the other end before Sarah spoke again. “That’s creepy. Did you call the police?”

“I’m not sure what to tell them.. and I…” I stopped mid-sentence, glancing at the coffee table again, where the photo still sat. It felt like it was staring back at me, an eerie reminder that someone had been close enough to take it. “I don’t even know what to say. What if they think I’m just overreacting?”

Sarah’s voice grew more alert. “You’re not overreacting. Someone took a photo of you and left it in your apartment. That’s serious. You need to call them.”

I bit my lip, considering it. “Maybe you’re right. But… it’s just so bizarre. And Tom keeps checking on me. It’s like he knows something, but I don’t know if I’m being paranoid.”

“Wait, Tom?” Sarah asked, confused. “Your neighbor?”

“Yeah,” I said, lowering my voice even though I was alone. “He’s been around every time something weird happens. He texted me just after I found the photo, said he saw someone hanging around my door. It’s almost like he’s watching me.”

“Okay, that’s weird. Do you think he could be involved?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, glancing nervously at the front door. “He’s always been friendly, but now it feels… off. I don’t know what to think.”

Sarah sighed. “Look, I really think you should call the police. Even if it’s nothing, better safe than sorry. And maybe keep your distance from Tom for a bit. Just in case.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah, maybe I’ll do that. Thanks, Sarah.”

“Stay safe, okay?” she said, her voice a little softer now. “Call me if you need anything.”

After hanging up with Sarah, I sat in the silence for a long moment… but she was right. It was better to be safe than sorry.

I dialed the non-emergency number, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I waited for them to pick up. When I finally spoke, my voice sounded smaller than I intended.

“I’d like to report something suspicious,” I said, trying to keep my tone steady. “I think someone’s been watching me… and maybe even inside my apartment.”

The dispatcher took down my information, asking for the details of what had happened with the photos and the sounds outside my door. I tried my best to explain, though it felt surreal even as the words left my mouth. By the time the call ended, they assured me that an officer would be dispatched to check things out.

It wasn’t long before I heard the knock at the door. My heart jumped, but when I checked the peephole, I saw the distinct navy-blue uniforms of two police officers standing just outside. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and let them inside.

One of the officers, a tall man with tired eyes, introduced himself. “Ma’am, we’re here to follow up on your report. Mind if we ask a few questions?”

I nodded, still feeling uneasy despite their presence. I led them into the living room, where they asked me to go over the events again in more detail. As I described the photos, the unlocked door, and the eerie feeling that I was being followed, the officer took notes, his partner occasionally glancing around the apartment.

“Have you noticed anyone suspicious hanging around recently?” the officer asked.

I hesitated. “There’s my neighbor, Tom. He’s been really helpful, but… I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. He’s always around, checking on me, and it seems a little too convenient.”

The officer nodded, his expression unreadable. “We’ll talk to him. Just to cover all the bases.”

After I finished explaining everything, they went down the hall to speak with Tom. I stayed inside, pacing nervously, listening to the muffled conversation through the door. It wasn’t long before the officers returned.

“Your neighbor says he hasn’t noticed anything unusual, but he’s concerned for your safety,” the officer said, his voice calm. “He offered to keep an eye out for anything strange.”

I nodded, not sure if that made me feel better or worse.

“Look, we don’t have enough for a full investigation right now,” the officer continued, “but we’ll keep a patrol car parked outside tonight, just in case. You should try to get some rest.”

I thanked them, feeling a slight sense of relief at the idea of police nearby. Maybe now, with someone watching over the apartment, I could get some rest.

I couldn’t sleep. The events of the night replayed in my mind, the unsettling photos, the noises outside my door, and Tom’s messages. The fear settled in deep, keeping me alert, despite the police being outside. I stayed up all night, jumping at every creak in the apartment, every distant sound from the street. The small knife I had tucked into my bag for protection felt like my only source of comfort as dawn finally broke.

The next day passed in a haze of routine, but the weight of the previous night’s fear lingered at the back of my mind. I went through my workday mechanically, my body tired but my thoughts racing. By the time I finished my shift, the sky had already darkened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over me.

As I made my way home, I decided to stop by the convenience store a few blocks from my apartment. I needed something to help me unwind, maybe a snack and a drink to go with the movie I’d planned to watch. The store was brightly lit, a small beacon of normalcy amidst the growing shadows of the evening.

I walked inside, the sound of the automatic doors hissing as they slid open. Grabbing a soda and a bag of chips, I wandered toward the counter, trying to shake the nerves that still clung to me.

The cold night air felt sharp against my skin as I left the convenience store, clutching the plastic bag of snacks. Ever since I found those photos in my apartment, my nerves had been on edge. I kept one hand near the knife in my jacket pocket as I walked quickly through the dimly lit parking lot. Something didn’t feel right, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

The parking lot felt unnervingly still, the flickering streetlights casting long, distorted shadows over the scattered cars. The silence pressed in around me, broken only by the faint hum of the lights overhead. I quickened my pace, the sound of my own footsteps loud and uneven. My breath hitched, and I glanced back, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was no one.

My heart pounded harder, every instinct screaming at me to move faster. The shadows felt like they were closing in, stretching farther across the pavement as I hurried toward the far end of the lot. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, just the leftover fear from the night before .

Then, everything went dark. A bag was yanked over my head with brutal force, and strong arms wrapped around my throat, squeezing tight. Panic surged through me as I thrashed wildly, trying to scream, but the sound was muffled by the bag, my voice trapped inside. My lungs burned, desperate for air, but each breath came in shallow, choking gasps.

The grip around my throat tightened, and my vision started to blur. My legs kicked out violently, but I couldn’t break free. Every muscle in my body screamed for oxygen, for a way out, but the world around me was fading, slipping into darkness. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

My hand fumbled toward my pocket, feeling the cold steel of the knife. With the last ounce of strength I had left, I yanked it free and swung blindly behind me. I felt the blade hit flesh, and a low grunt of pain followed. The grip on my throat loosened just enough for me to rip the bag from my head.

I gasped for air, stumbling forward, vision swimming as I tried to regain my balance. My entire body trembled with fear and adrenaline, but I forced myself to turn around. He stood there, hunched over, clutching his side where I had slashed him. Blood poured between his fingers, staining the pavement beneath him, but his eyes… his eyes were locked on me with a burning hatred.

""Who are you?""I rasped, my voice shaking, barely able to speak.

His twisted grin sent a shiver down my spine. ""You don’t remember me?"" he said, his voice low, full of contempt. ""Of course you don’t.""

I stared at him, struggling to place his face. There was something familiar about him, but it was like grasping at a half-forgotten memory.

""You think you’re so much better than me,"" he hissed, taking a shaky step forward despite the wound.

""You never even looked at me back then. You laughed, like I didn’t matter.""

The memory hit me like a cold wave. High school. He had been there, always lurking in the background, quiet, unassuming . Someone I had barely noticed. I swallowed hard, dread settling deep in my chest.

""You,"" I whispered, feeling a rising sense of horror. ""I barely remember you.""

“You rejected me, like I was nothing."" He took another step, his breath ragged. ""But I swore you’d pay for it one day.""

My pulse raced as his words sank in. This wasn’t just some random attack. He had planned this. He had been waiting for this moment, fueled by a hatred I hadn’t even known existed.

""I didn’t want your love,"" he said, his voice trembling with anger. ""I wanted you to feel what it’s like to be nothing. To feel hunted. To feel powerless.""

I backed away, my heart pounding against my chest. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""That was years ago.""

His face contorted with rage. ""You thought you could laugh at me and walk away. But I’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting all this time to make you suffer.""

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him as his breath came in shallow gasps. I stood there, paralyzed, watching him struggle to breathe, trying to comprehend the nightmare that had unfolded in front of me. A boy I barely remembered from my past had plotted his revenge for years, and now he had come for me.

Then, I heard it . The soft chime of a text message.

My pulse quickened as I looked down at his limp body. His phone must have gone off. My hands shook as I crouched down, reaching toward his jacket pocket. For a moment, I hesitated, but then I forced my hand inside.

I pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing with a new notification.

The message read: ""Did you get the job done?""

I opened the conversation and what I saw made my blood freeze .

There were photos of me : walking to work, leaving my apartment, moving through my daily life. He

had been watching me for weeks, maybe longer. Each photo was sent to him with a chilling, calculated precision.

My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I scrolled up further. The stalker had been communicating with someone else, someone who had been helping him all along. My blood ran cold as I read through the exchange.

""Make sure she finds the pictures.""

""Tonight’s the night. I’m going to finish this.""

Then came the reply from earlier that night: ""I don’t care what you do, as long as I get paid.""

With growing terror, I pulled out my own phone and compared the unknown number to my contacts. My hands shook violently as I scrolled through my list, praying I was wrong. But when I saw the match, my heart plummeted.

It was Tom...

A wave of nausea hit me as the realization set in. Tom, the friendly neighbor who had always been so concerned, so helpful, had been involved from the beginning. He had been feeding information to my stalker, planting the photos, manipulating me . All for money.

I felt numb as I dialed the police, my voice shaking as I tried to explain everything. Tom had betrayed me in the worst possible way, and I had never even suspected him.

It didn’t take long. A knock at Tom’s door echoed through the hallway, louder than I’d ever heard before. I stepped out into the corridor, standing in the shadows as the police spoke to him. I held my breath as I watched the scene unfold.

Tom opened the door, calm as ever, his face the picture of confusion. ""What’s going on?"" he asked, his voice dripping with faux innocence.

They moved swiftly, stepping inside. Within moments, Tom was in handcuffs, his calm facade cracking ever so slightly. His eyes locked onto mine, just for a second, as they led him past me down the hallway.

""You were always so easy to fool,"" he said, his voice low, cold, and with a grim smirk on his face.

How could I have been so blind? He had been right there, pretending to care, pulling the strings the entire time.

As I sat in my apartment, alone and shaken, I realized how close I had come to losing everything . Not just my life, but my sense of trust. I thought I had known who the real danger was, but the truth had been right in front of me the whole time, hidden behind a [neighbor’s smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeRkJGurY8).",2,1728315666.0,nosleep,0,0.67,False

Our realtionship is good overall. He's kind, caring, patient, sweet, and I know that he loves me. The biggest issue in our relationship is I feel that there's a lack of effort and initiative to see each other more and have more romance in our relationship from him. Sometimes feels like we're not in a relationship really and more of a glorified friendship that mostly takes place over text. It's a conversation we've had for months and he always says he will do better because I deserve it but it never happens for long. When we are together it's good, but it just takes a while for us to actually be together!

He's busy. He works in the morning and then three times a week he volunteers as an assistant band instructor at his old high school. He has practices, weekend games, and performances and I understand that. I just wish he would take more effort in being the one to plan too see each other and dates without me having to ask and jusy do a little bit more to make me feel like our relationship is also a priority in his life.

Im the one who suggested the break. I asked if he felt like he had time in his life right now for a relationship and he hesiated. I then asked if he felt like he needed some time apart and he agreed. He was emotional  but didnt give me any push back which hurt me a bit that he didnt fight more. My boyfriend says he doesn't know how long this will last because he feels like he needs to get his life together and more in control. While I understand that and I understand because i am too going through some of my own things right now, I don't need him to be perfect. Because I am not perfect and I also have things I need to work on personally to also be better.  I just want a commitment that he will put in the effort.

We're planning to meet on Friday for  coffee and I want to have a deeper talk more about how exactly I want to be treated, what makes me feel loved, etc and learn more what he needs from me as well to be a better partner.  This is both of our first relationship so we both had to learn how to be in one and never really outright talked about our expectations, so I think that plays a part too. We were so awkward and both a bit reserved at first but we made progress but I feel that still comes up for us both sometimes too.

Since our issue is not that big, I feel like it shouldn't take so long for him to need decide if he can committ to putting in more effort after we talk about our expectations and needs?

WIBTA if I tell him on Friday that he has a week to decide (it will then be two weeks break in our 2 year realtionship)?  I want to be considerate of his space, but don't want to continue to feel like I'm waiting for him and being the one to constantly initiate the hard conversations.",1,1728315664.0,AITA_Relationships,1,1.0,False
1fyappg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wls/comments/1fyappg/do_you_use_any_software_for_tracking_proteinother/,Do you use any software for tracking protein/other data? Like on your phone or watch?,"I use an iPhone and Apple Watch to keep track of my meals. I have a notes app (SnipNotes) that syncs to the Watch (Apple's stock Notes app does not work on their Watch), and I use it to note when my last meal was. I also have a Shortcuts tool that logs protein. Apple Health isn't fully on the Watch, but a few things are recorded by specific apps. I'm surprised this Shortcut works — it does *not* work on my Mac, saying Apple Health is not available on the Mac. But, it works on my Watch. Asks me how much protein I consumed, then asks the date and time. I can't review previous entries though, hence the note.

For liquid, I use WaterMinder. It tracks all kinds of beverages and gives a hydration score. Water is worth 1.0, which means 20 ounces of water is reported to Apple Health as 20 ounces of water. (All Apple Health cares about is water.) Coffee has a score of 0.9, which means for every 10 ounces of coffee I claim in WM, it tells Apple Health I drank 9 ounces of water, plus however much caffeine. Sports Drinks (like Gatorade) have a score of 1.2, so for every 10 ounces of Gatorade, it tells Apple Health I drank 12 ounces of water.

I don't recall what I paid for WaterMinder. Maybe $6 tops? It competes with another app, WaterLlama, which has an ongoing subscription. I paid $10 for SnipNotes, which I think is free, but if you want sync between iPhone, Mac, and Watch (all of which I need), it's $10. It's less if you only need sync between two of them (I forget which two).

There's a way to share Shortcuts, but I don't know how to make Shortcuts and it was SUPER easy to set up. I literally just made a new Shortcut, found Health, and found Protein (it would be under Nutrition). I added a text prompt to make it user-friendly, but that's not necessary. That said, I can probably share the Shortcut if someone really wants it.

I've tried MyFitnessPal, but it won't let me sign up. They won't let me use my name, or any random combination of letters and numbers I've tried. I've contacted support and their response is ""keep trying."" Like really? Just let me use my name. If someone else is using my name, make them pick something else. Like their name. Or assign me a random name. Having to answer all their questions every time the name choice fails gets old after 2-3 tries.

If I were a programmer, I'd make an app, but I'm not... I feel like bariatric patients in particular should have an app that tracks liquid/water intake, as well as food.

I'm looking for recommendations in the Apple ecosystem (Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch), but if you have recommendations for Android/Windows, well, I'm sure others will benefit, so don't hold back if that's all you have! Also, if something is only on one platform, it might be possible to persuade the developer to port it over to the other.

Lastly, if I've flaired this post incorrectly, please let me know! I don't know what ""accountability"" means. If it only means payment, I'll change it to ""Off Topic,"" but I assumed ""accountability"" could be useful here! I use these apps to keep myself accountable to my diet.",1,1728315626.0,wls,2,1.0,False

“Burning the midnight oil again?” he asked.

“Yeah, work’s been crazy lately,” I replied, pausing for a moment before heading toward the door. “You?”

“Couldn’t sleep,” he said, shrugging. “Figured I’d step out for a bit.”

I nodded, pushing the front door open. “See you around.”

“Take it easy,” Tom replied before I disappeared inside.

The elevator was sluggish as usual, and I found myself staring at the scratched-up panel of buttons. I lived on the fourth floor, and as the elevator crept upward, I glanced back at my phone. More notifications, more things to deal with tomorrow.

When the elevator doors finally opened, I stepped into the quiet hallway. My apartment was at the far end, and I could see a faint light coming from under my door .  I must have left the lamp on when I left earlier. Not unusual. I always forgot little things like that.

But when I reached my door, something caught my attention. The door wasn’t closed all the way. It was barely noticeable, just a fraction of an inch, but it was enough to make me stop. I didn’t remember leaving it like that. I stood there for a moment, staring at the door, my hand hovering just above the knob.

I reached for the door, but as I grasped the knob, I froze. The door was unlocked. I was sure I had locked it before leaving, as I always did. I stood there, staring at the knob, trying to make sense of it. Maybe I had been in such a hurry earlier that I forgot. But no, I distinctly remembered the click of the lock as I left.

A knot tightened in my stomach as I pushed the door open. The apartment was quiet, everything seemingly in its place. The small lamp in the living room cast a soft glow, illuminating the familiar surroundings. I stepped inside and locked the door behind me, twisting the lock back and forth as if to reassure myself that it was working properly.

I walked into the living room, tossing my keys onto the counter, and that’s when I saw it. Lying on the coffee table, where nothing had been earlier, was a photograph. My breath caught in my throat. I didn’t remember leaving it there, and more importantly, I didn’t own any printed photos.

I stepped closer, my heart thudding in my chest. The photo was of me. Taken earlier today, on my walk from work. I recognized the street, the same one I had walked down just hours ago. My hand trembled as I picked it up, flipping it over to see if there was anything written on the back. There wasn’t.

Whoever took this photo had been watching me. They had followed me, and now they had been inside my apartment.

I felt a rush of adrenaline, my mind racing with questions. How did they get in? Had I really left the door unlocked? I didn’t think so. I quickly scanned the room again, looking for anything else that might have been moved, but everything seemed in place. I checked the windows, but they were locked too.

Suddenly, my phone buzzed in my pocket, startling me. I pulled it out, half expecting to see a message from the stalker, but it was just Tom, my neighbor.

“Hey, you okay? You looked kind of off earlier,” his message read.

I stared at the screen, my thoughts too scattered to reply right away. Tom had been outside when I came home. Could he have noticed something? Should I tell him about the photo?

I hesitated for a moment, staring at Tom’s message. Should I tell him about the photo? Part of me wanted to confide in someone, but another part felt like I needed to keep it to myself, at least for now. I didn’t know what I was dealing with, and jumping to conclusions didn’t feel right.

After a long pause, I typed out a quick reply: “Yeah, just a rough day at work. Thanks for checking in.”

I put my phone down, running my hand through my hair as I tried to steady my breathing. The photo still sat on the table, taunting me. My mind raced, thinking through all the possibilities. Who had taken it? Why leave it here? How did they get in?

Trying to distract myself, I turned on the TV, hoping that some background noise would help calm my nerves. But I couldn’t focus. My thoughts kept circling back to the unlocked door and the photo. It was almost like someone wanted me to know I was being watched . Someone who knew I’d come home tonight and find their little message.

I stood up and walked around the apartment, checking the windows again, though I knew they were already locked. My eyes wandered over every corner of the room, looking for anything else out of place. Nothing. Just that photo.

The buzz of my phone startled me again. Another message from Tom.

“If you need anything, let me know. I’m up for a while.”

I stared at the message, feeling uneasy. Tom had always been friendly, but now it seemed like he was paying extra attention. I hadn’t noticed it before, but maybe I had never looked for it. Was I overthinking things? Or was it just a coincidence that he was always nearby, always checking in at the right time?

I didn’t respond to his message. Instead, I paced the room, glancing at the clock. It was past midnight now, and sleep felt impossible. My mind kept going over the day, trying to remember if I had seen anyone suspicious, anyone who might have followed me.

Suddenly, a soft knock came at the door.

The knock at the door sent a jolt through my body. I wasn’t expecting anyone at this hour. I hesitated, my heart pounding in my chest as I tiptoed toward the peephole. It was Tom, standing there with his hands in his pockets, looking casual. For a brief second, I felt relieved. Then, I remembered the photo on the coffee table and the unlocked door. My nerves tightened again.

I opened the door just a crack, trying to keep my voice steady. “Hey, what’s up?”

Tom smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Sorry to bother you. I thought I heard something strange, like someone messing with your door earlier. Just wanted to check in, make sure you’re okay.”

I blinked, trying to process what he was saying. “You heard someone?”

“Yeah, probably just some drunk or something, but it didn’t seem right,” Tom continued, his eyes flicking past me into the apartment. “Thought I’d make sure everything was cool.”

My hand gripped the edge of the door tighter. I wasn’t sure what to make of this. Tom had always been friendly, but the timing of his concern felt off. And if he had really heard something, why hadn’t he called me or knocked earlier?

“I’m fine,” I said quickly, trying to close the door a bit more. “Thanks for checking in.”

Tom’s smile faltered just a bit. “Okay, well… just let me know if you need anything.”

I nodded, forcing a smile before closing the door fully and locking it. As soon as I was alone again, I let out a breath I hadn’t realized I was holding. Something about the whole situation didn’t sit right with me. I glanced back at the photo on the table, the reminder of someone having been inside, watching me.

My phone buzzed again, and I nearly jumped. Another message from Tom.

“Sorry if I freaked you out. Just being a good neighbor.”

I stared at the message, feeling my skin crawl. He was being too attentive, too involved. It was hard not to connect the dots. First the unlocked door, then the photo, and now Tom always seeming to be around at the perfect moment. I couldn’t shake the feeling that he knew more than he was letting on.

I decided I needed to talk to someone, so I called my friend Sarah. As the phone rang, I paced around the living room, my mind still racing. When she finally answered, her voice was groggy.

“Hey… everything okay?” she asked, clearly half-asleep.

“I don’t know,” I admitted. “Something weird’s been happening. Someone was in my apartment earlier, I think. They left a photo of me from today.”

There was a pause on the other end before Sarah spoke again. “That’s creepy. Did you call the police?”

“I’m not sure what to tell them.. and I…” I stopped mid-sentence, glancing at the coffee table again, where the photo still sat. It felt like it was staring back at me, an eerie reminder that someone had been close enough to take it. “I don’t even know what to say. What if they think I’m just overreacting?”

Sarah’s voice grew more alert. “You’re not overreacting. Someone took a photo of you and left it in your apartment. That’s serious. You need to call them.”

I bit my lip, considering it. “Maybe you’re right. But… it’s just so bizarre. And Tom keeps checking on me. It’s like he knows something, but I don’t know if I’m being paranoid.”

“Wait, Tom?” Sarah asked, confused. “Your neighbor?”

“Yeah,” I said, lowering my voice even though I was alone. “He’s been around every time something weird happens. He texted me just after I found the photo, said he saw someone hanging around my door. It’s almost like he’s watching me.”

“Okay, that’s weird. Do you think he could be involved?”

“I don’t know,” I admitted, glancing nervously at the front door. “He’s always been friendly, but now it feels… off. I don’t know what to think.”

Sarah sighed. “Look, I really think you should call the police. Even if it’s nothing, better safe than sorry. And maybe keep your distance from Tom for a bit. Just in case.”

I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. “Yeah, maybe I’ll do that. Thanks, Sarah.”

“Stay safe, okay?” she said, her voice a little softer now. “Call me if you need anything.”

After hanging up with Sarah, I sat in the silence for a long moment… but she was right. It was better to be safe than sorry.

I dialed the non-emergency number, feeling a wave of anxiety wash over me as I waited for them to pick up. When I finally spoke, my voice sounded smaller than I intended.

“I’d like to report something suspicious,” I said, trying to keep my tone steady. “I think someone’s been watching me… and maybe even inside my apartment.”

The dispatcher took down my information, asking for the details of what had happened with the photos and the sounds outside my door. I tried my best to explain, though it felt surreal even as the words left my mouth. By the time the call ended, they assured me that an officer would be dispatched to check things out.

It wasn’t long before I heard the knock at the door. My heart jumped, but when I checked the peephole, I saw the distinct navy-blue uniforms of two police officers standing just outside. Taking a deep breath, I opened the door and let them inside.

One of the officers, a tall man with tired eyes, introduced himself. “Ma’am, we’re here to follow up on your report. Mind if we ask a few questions?”

I nodded, still feeling uneasy despite their presence. I led them into the living room, where they asked me to go over the events again in more detail. As I described the photos, the unlocked door, and the eerie feeling that I was being followed, the officer took notes, his partner occasionally glancing around the apartment.

“Have you noticed anyone suspicious hanging around recently?” the officer asked.

I hesitated. “There’s my neighbor, Tom. He’s been really helpful, but… I don’t know. It’s just a feeling. He’s always around, checking on me, and it seems a little too convenient.”

The officer nodded, his expression unreadable. “We’ll talk to him. Just to cover all the bases.”

After I finished explaining everything, they went down the hall to speak with Tom. I stayed inside, pacing nervously, listening to the muffled conversation through the door. It wasn’t long before the officers returned.

“Your neighbor says he hasn’t noticed anything unusual, but he’s concerned for your safety,” the officer said, his voice calm. “He offered to keep an eye out for anything strange.”

I nodded, not sure if that made me feel better or worse.

“Look, we don’t have enough for a full investigation right now,” the officer continued, “but we’ll keep a patrol car parked outside tonight, just in case. You should try to get some rest.”

I thanked them, feeling a slight sense of relief at the idea of police nearby. Maybe now, with someone watching over the apartment, I could get some rest.

I couldn’t sleep. The events of the night replayed in my mind, the unsettling photos, the noises outside my door, and Tom’s messages. The fear settled in deep, keeping me alert, despite the police being outside. I stayed up all night, jumping at every creak in the apartment, every distant sound from the street. The small knife I had tucked into my bag for protection felt like my only source of comfort as dawn finally broke.

The next day passed in a haze of routine, but the weight of the previous night’s fear lingered at the back of my mind. I went through my workday mechanically, my body tired but my thoughts racing. By the time I finished my shift, the sky had already darkened, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that had settled over me.

As I made my way home, I decided to stop by the convenience store a few blocks from my apartment. I needed something to help me unwind, maybe a snack and a drink to go with the movie I’d planned to watch. The store was brightly lit, a small beacon of normalcy amidst the growing shadows of the evening.

I walked inside, the sound of the automatic doors hissing as they slid open. Grabbing a soda and a bag of chips, I wandered toward the counter, trying to shake the nerves that still clung to me.

The cold night air felt sharp against my skin as I left the convenience store, clutching the plastic bag of snacks. Ever since I found those photos in my apartment, my nerves had been on edge. I kept one hand near the knife in my jacket pocket as I walked quickly through the dimly lit parking lot. Something didn’t feel right, and I couldn’t shake the feeling of being watched.

The parking lot felt unnervingly still, the flickering streetlights casting long, distorted shadows over the scattered cars. The silence pressed in around me, broken only by the faint hum of the lights overhead. I quickened my pace, the sound of my own footsteps loud and uneven. My breath hitched, and I glanced back, expecting to see someone behind me, but there was no one.

My heart pounded harder, every instinct screaming at me to move faster. The shadows felt like they were closing in, stretching farther across the pavement as I hurried toward the far end of the lot. I tried to tell myself it was just paranoia, just the leftover fear from the night before .

Then, everything went dark. A bag was yanked over my head with brutal force, and strong arms wrapped around my throat, squeezing tight. Panic surged through me as I thrashed wildly, trying to scream, but the sound was muffled by the bag, my voice trapped inside. My lungs burned, desperate for air, but each breath came in shallow, choking gasps.

The grip around my throat tightened, and my vision started to blur. My legs kicked out violently, but I couldn’t break free. Every muscle in my body screamed for oxygen, for a way out, but the world around me was fading, slipping into darkness. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t think.

My hand fumbled toward my pocket, feeling the cold steel of the knife. With the last ounce of strength I had left, I yanked it free and swung blindly behind me. I felt the blade hit flesh, and a low grunt of pain followed. The grip on my throat loosened just enough for me to rip the bag from my head.

I gasped for air, stumbling forward, vision swimming as I tried to regain my balance. My entire body trembled with fear and adrenaline, but I forced myself to turn around. He stood there, hunched over, clutching his side where I had slashed him. Blood poured between his fingers, staining the pavement beneath him, but his eyes… his eyes were locked on me with a burning hatred.

""Who are you?""I rasped, my voice shaking, barely able to speak.

His twisted grin sent a shiver down my spine. ""You don’t remember me?"" he said, his voice low, full of contempt. ""Of course you don’t.""

I stared at him, struggling to place his face. There was something familiar about him, but it was like grasping at a half-forgotten memory.

""You think you’re so much better than me,"" he hissed, taking a shaky step forward despite the wound.

""You never even looked at me back then. You laughed, like I didn’t matter.""

The memory hit me like a cold wave. High school. He had been there, always lurking in the background, quiet, unassuming . Someone I had barely noticed. I swallowed hard, dread settling deep in my chest.

""You,"" I whispered, feeling a rising sense of horror. ""I barely remember you.""

“You rejected me, like I was nothing."" He took another step, his breath ragged. ""But I swore you’d pay for it one day.""

My pulse raced as his words sank in. This wasn’t just some random attack. He had planned this. He had been waiting for this moment, fueled by a hatred I hadn’t even known existed.

""I didn’t want your love,"" he said, his voice trembling with anger. ""I wanted you to feel what it’s like to be nothing. To feel hunted. To feel powerless.""

I backed away, my heart pounding against my chest. ""I don’t understand,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""That was years ago.""

His face contorted with rage. ""You thought you could laugh at me and walk away. But I’ve been waiting. I’ve been waiting all this time to make you suffer.""

His legs gave out, and he collapsed to the ground, blood pooling beneath him as his breath came in shallow gasps. I stood there, paralyzed, watching him struggle to breathe, trying to comprehend the nightmare that had unfolded in front of me. A boy I barely remembered from my past had plotted his revenge for years, and now he had come for me.

Then, I heard it . The soft chime of a text message.

My pulse quickened as I looked down at his limp body. His phone must have gone off. My hands shook as I crouched down, reaching toward his jacket pocket. For a moment, I hesitated, but then I forced my hand inside.

I pulled out his phone, the screen still glowing with a new notification.

The message read: ""Did you get the job done?""

I opened the conversation and what I saw made my blood freeze .

There were photos of me : walking to work, leaving my apartment, moving through my daily life. He

had been watching me for weeks, maybe longer. Each photo was sent to him with a chilling, calculated precision.

My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I scrolled up further. The stalker had been communicating with someone else, someone who had been helping him all along. My blood ran cold as I read through the exchange.

""Make sure she finds the pictures.""

""Tonight’s the night. I’m going to finish this.""

Then came the reply from earlier that night: ""I don’t care what you do, as long as I get paid.""

With growing terror, I pulled out my own phone and compared the unknown number to my contacts. My hands shook violently as I scrolled through my list, praying I was wrong. But when I saw the match, my heart plummeted.

It was Tom...

A wave of nausea hit me as the realization set in. Tom, the friendly neighbor who had always been so concerned, so helpful, had been involved from the beginning. He had been feeding information to my stalker, planting the photos, manipulating me . All for money.

I felt numb as I dialed the police, my voice shaking as I tried to explain everything. Tom had betrayed me in the worst possible way, and I had never even suspected him.

It didn’t take long. A knock at Tom’s door echoed through the hallway, louder than I’d ever heard before. I stepped out into the corridor, standing in the shadows as the police spoke to him. I held my breath as I watched the scene unfold.

Tom opened the door, calm as ever, his face the picture of confusion. ""What’s going on?"" he asked, his voice dripping with faux innocence.

They moved swiftly, stepping inside. Within moments, Tom was in handcuffs, his calm facade cracking ever so slightly. His eyes locked onto mine, just for a second, as they led him past me down the hallway.

""You were always so easy to fool,"" he said, his voice low, cold, and with a grim smirk on his face.

How could I have been so blind? He had been right there, pretending to care, pulling the strings the entire time.

As I sat in my apartment, alone and shaken, I realized how close I had come to losing everything . Not just my life, but my sense of trust. I thought I had known who the real danger was, but the truth had been right in front of me the whole time, hidden behind a [neighbor’s smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmeRkJGurY8).

1fyan04,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1fyan04/my_dad_beat_up_my_ex_boyfriend/,My dad beat up my ex boyfriend!!,"So this happened a while ago, I(22F) still don't know if I did the right thing, but here goes. Most of my life I've lived with my mom (45 F) and my two sisters. Though I've known who my dad(45 m)is most of my life, he was never a big part of my past or raising me. Now onto the story. So when I turned 18 I wanted to live with him for a little bit, I graduated in 2020 which was COVID's year so my senior year got cut short. Everything was really good when I first went down there, we went camping, fishing, most backwoods country things minus what nasty people do out there lol. A couple months after that he started dating this women, we'll  call her Bizzo(43F) for the story, Right off the bat this chick was a little crazy, after only a few days of knowing eachother she moved in with us, I was fine with it because she was in a tight spot and I don't mind helping people out. I worked at a gas station at the time and that's how I met josh(25m) (fake name duh). We didn't start dating until about a year later and in that year I was ready to throw a house on bizzo. My dad worked at a steel plant and worked 12 hours a day 5 days a week, so to say his job was demanding is an understatement. She would constantly be texting him and if he didn't call her any chance he got she would start blowing up my phone freaking out asking if he was cheating on her and saying that it was ok and I could be honest with her. I remember one time specifically when his phone was crushed by a crain at work and for 11 hours she was texting me, calling me, and constantly crying. As soon as my dad got home I sent a pic of his phone to her (even the back of the phone was crushed guys). They spent the rest of the night talking on my phone. After a month she proposed to him and he said yes. They both got mad at me when all I said was isn't it a bit soon? Don't get me wrong if you want to get married do it idc, but you asked for my opinion that's what it is. After about six months they got married I did the photos for the wedding. I wouldn't say she was a bridezilla, cause she's not a mean person just really passive aggressive. I offered to do her hair and makeup because I was doing my own and she said she wanted her friend anni who apparently took cosmetic classes or something. I never want to make someone feel bad on they're big day but bizzo looked a little ridiculous, Annie couldn't do a winged eye to save her life and bizzos hair looked like a poodle. Moving on. Bizzo asked me specifically to do the photos for the wedding since my phone camera was the best out of anyone's and I had taken photography courses all throughout high school( I am not a professional photographer by any means) I asked everyone to please not get in my way while taking the pictures but that they were more than welcome to take they're own. Annie immediately got in my way and then kept giving me side eye when I'd ask her to move. The whole situation at this point I was over it. Then a couple months after I had done a little editing with the photos bringing out the colors more Bizzo loved them but kept saying that I should've done my hair and makeup differently since I looked better than her in the photos. I was in one of the wedding photos, I was in a cheap blue dress from Walmart that had big printed flowers on it. Plus I guess the nail shop we choose a day prior had done her color scheme wrong 😑. But they had done mine perfectly. She choose her own colors btw. This is a small instance that happened. About a year into me living with my father I started seeing Josh and because my dad didn't approve I was promptly kicked out. Me and Josh lived on our own from about May to November and since I wasn't budging and I was working hard I lost 40 pounds in a week and I was still dropping weight from being stressed and not eating, Josh did not have a job at this time and we had 2 dogs and 2 cats and I was paying for everything. I smoke green but I have never done dr*gs in my entire life and don't plan to. The moment bizzo saw me and how much weight I lost she asked ""Are you doing dr*gs, cause that's the only way you would lose weight that fast"" It all came to a head when my dad had called me about doing my taxes and I was literally pulling out of an H&R parking lot after doing them and Josh was driving. The ball joint on the passenger side busted and that was my breaking point I immediately started crying and all Bizzo could say was don't cry because crying doesn't solve anything. My dad replied and said that I was stressed and needed to vent. He said he was on his way and would be there asap to wait for the tow truck with us. We spent thanksgiving together all four of us. It was a lot of fun when my cooking wasn't being watched by Bizzo. Me and Josh moved in a couple weeks before Christmas cause my dad felt bad and offered to let us have the upstairs loft and we agreed. He was asking for 400 dollars a month which was perfect for me cause he also got Josh a job. I was content and things we're looking better for all of us. I didn't realize during the time I was living with just Josh how much Bizzo was getting to my dad. He's always had anger issues but I have a lot of patience for people and was always able to deal with it and help him instead of making it worse. Bizzo was not as patient almost every day she would sit there and push his buttons then have an attitude with the littlest things and then make little aggressive remarks. Like that's not how I would do it, or it's easier if you do it like this🙄. I was literally doing the dishes. My dad try's very hard not to be an angry person and he's one of those people to give you the cloths off his back if you were cold. Everyone has a breaking point and yea he choose this but that doesn't mean I can't have sympathy for him in this situation. With all of that going on and Josh not exactly being the hardest worker, one thing that's gonna make my dad mad is being lazy. Josh was a very lazy person but for good reason, he had scoliosis so his back would tweak out constantly. I've never had that so I wouldn't know what it's like. My dad however saw this as no excuse because he had back, knee, feet, basically body problem in general and it never got in his way. My father is a pretty big man weighing about 300lbs at the time. Josh only weighed about 2lbs soaking wet. It all came to a head around mid may of 2022 me and my father were arguing about something I can't even remember the specifics of the argument. But I've always told Josh to stay out of me and my dads fights because we're a lot a like and he won't be able to get a word in. At the same time what happenes between me and my dad is between me and him no one else. Bizzo learned that the hard way. I was up in the loft and we were yelling back and forth, Josh was at my left sitting on the couch, my dad started coming up the stairs and we were both screaming at eachother when Josh chimed in and said ""can we please all talk like adults"" this sent my dad over the edge he put his hand on Ian's chest pushed him into the couch to where Josh was on his back and started to punch him in the face. I was pushing him, hitting him kicking, screaming, anything I could to get him off Josh. My dad grabbed me by the throat and told me to "" stay the f*ck out of it."" Before throwing me backwards in between a chair and coffee table. Then went back to punching Josh. After about two more hits he got off and walked away. As soon as he did I went to Josh and with a towel cause his nose got the brunt of it. My dad broke his nose, 6 of his front teeth, and fractured his cheekbone on his right eye. We immediately went to file a police report, Josh decided to press charges I decided not too. No matter what unfortunately he was still my father. After we went to the hospital for Josh, got some medication and we moved into a camper on Josh's parents property. A month later he broke up with me and with nothing left down there I moved back up where I currently am with my mom. Thank you for listening to my story sorry if it was confusing 🫤. I'm doing a lot better now and me and my dad are at least on speaking terms now. ",1,1728315442.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

I have the 2019 model and have installed a few Shades mods but never had the courage or ability to install the PID which I found too intimidating.

Without a PID I have been getting consistent espresso which I am very happy with and have no intention to improve the brewing setup further. 

However, the steam functionality has always been shocking and this was, if anything, what I wanted the PID to help improve.

So I was pleased to see the Supersteam+ mod as this would improve the steam with only a very simple bit of cabling and thermostat change. I also installed the single hole steam wand upgrade 'The One'.

The installation was only 5 minutes or so, very straightforward. The difference is enormous, the power is much higher and genuinely unlimited as long as there is water in the tank. It has done exactly what I needed it for and beaten my expectations.

The support chat was also amazing as I ran into a small issue of my own making and they worked through it with me very quickly.

Definitely would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to install a PID but wants better steam.",4,1728315399.0,gaggiaclassic,0,1.0,False

We both work for downtown Toronto firms as articling students (your equivalent of first year associates). I work for an elite mid-size (100 lawyer) litigation boutique that follows big law lock step and they work for a true big law firm although they do not have a NY office. She is interested mostly in IP litigation, and I, being a measly mid-law, am interested in litigation for the other side of the aisle (plaintiff/worker/union-side-type-work). This post is mostly for her since I know my firm name will carry minimal weight down there.

Both firms offer hire-back after this year, although with the economy in the toilet we’ve seen a rise in temporary contract offers (such as 6 or 8-months) instead of full job offers. We’re not in a rush to move to NYC but if we do not receive permanent offers then I figure the opportunity cost is lower now compared to if we are secure. We will be writing the NY bar exams next summer. 

Can anyone give us some advice on how to approach moving to NYC, my partner’s chances on landing a spot at a biglaw or adjacent firm, and whether we’re idiots for even trying? Are there any mid or big law firms that offer plaintiff/worker/union side positions specifically in labour, PI or class actions? 

We’ve considered LLMs but that is the last resort for her, simply because of the time and cost. 

We will be reaching out in the New Year for virtual coffee chats, and so looking for any advice!

I (31F) matched with a guy (36M), and we hit it off right away. We talked for over a week—lots of phone calls, texts, the whole thing. We finally met up, had a great night, and I ended up staying over at his place. The next morning, he disappeared for a while whilst i was still in bed, only to come back and tell me that his ex had reached out about possibly getting back together. I made it clear that it was none of my business, stayed for a little longer, had some nice small talk over a coffee then left his place on good terms.

We didn’t text or call after that, but later that day, he sent me a heartfelt message saying he wasn’t in the right place for dating and that the ex situation was real. I’ll admit, I was a bit skeptical because I've used that excuse myself to end things without hurting someone's feelings, but I responded politely, thanking him and saying it was good to meet him anyway.

Then, a few hours later, I found out I’d been blocked everywhere—unmatched on Bumble, blocked on my phone number, WhatsApp, all social media. It felt really harsh. I can't help but wonder if I’m taking this too personally. In the past when I’ve ended things after just one date, I’ve never felt the need to block the person entirely. Am I overreacting, or is this as brutal as it feels?

1fyaj28,https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaminD/comments/1fyaj28/please_help_do_i_have_hypercalcemia_magnesium/,PLEASE HELP: Do I have Hypercalcemia/ Magnesium deficiency or Vit D toxicity? ,"I am latino and originally form the Florida keys. I moved to New England about a decade ago & every-time I got bloodwork done my doctors always said my Vit d was low. 

About a year ago as fall approached I got so scared of how depressed I get in winter so I finally called my doctor who prescribed 50,000iu once a week which i started taking in November. 

When I tell you I have literally never felt so good, brand new, positive, energized- it’s honestly laughable that this whole time it was just that. Anyways I remember reading that you’re not supposed to take such a high dose for so long, so around January I got switched from 50,000iu d2 to 2000iu d3 daily.. Right away I remember noticing a difference (around 2-3 weeks after switching) & feeling sadder/ more insecure which my doctor gaslit me & told me was all in my head. I actually still had 4 doses of the 50,000iu and I ended up taking them bc my low mood (which lasted one more month) before getting worried and finally getting my levels tested which were at 70. My doctor said to just stop taking it altogether bc that’s in the upper range. Which I did for about 5-6weeks, but like clockwork, around 3 week mark I start feeling sad, melancholic, insecure & familiarly down- like I did before supplementing. 

So I’d decided my levels have probably dropped (it was also rainy spring season & I don’t go outside) so I decided to start the 2000iu maintaining dose bc SAD is no joke. 

Anyways overtime I adjusted, slowly felt normal (possibly due to the arrival of spring as well) but I did notice an uptick in anxiety that gradually increased over the late spring/summer months. 

I work from home and my job can be particularly stressful & it basically peaked in august where I noticed I was having breathlessness at night, depression, and eventually even panic attacks. I assumed it was coffee but then thought it might be vitd. So I stopped that and within 2 days, all anxiety symptoms gone but literally within days I notice lower energy and within 2-3 weeks AGAIN feeling sad and depressed. I get so insecure when I feel this way and I really hate it so I started up again 2000iu after about 5 weeks off & within literally 2 days I felt breathless and panicky. 

I read about magnesium so I bought a supplement with 800iu and 250mg of mag glyc which for one night felt nice, but the second night I took it , breathlessness again! 

I figured okay it’s low mag so I started supplementing with 400mg mag glyc with 2000iu and still breathless which fosters panic attacks… also worth noting even after stopping for over a month, and even after supplementing with mag glyc, 2000iu gave me such tight chest and breathlessness that when on a walk with my friend I genuinely could not catch my breath & felt so winded that I thought I genuinely was having a heart attack. …

I told myself okay clearly I’m so deficient in mag that I need to completely stop and just build it up. Well I then realized my MAGNESIUM gives me breathlessness too? It definitely gives me sedation the next day, but within 30 min of taking it I get slight breathlessness. 

So sorry this is so long but basically. I had to stop taking everything to stop the breathlessness and anxiety. I’m on one week now, and when I don’t take anything around day 2-3 I feel normal (physically). However again and again and again all my metal symptoms come back. I know after all these times it is literally vit d. It works like a serious anti depressant. I have a never in my life been as positive/ clear minded as I am when taking it and doctors have been telling me this for so long. I get so scared I’m just going to have to deal with being so ridiculously depressed & insecure when I am not normally like this. (Even my friends and fam are shocked at my metal symptoms self esteem bc usually I’m never like that)

So my main question is, can vit d actually cause a mini withdrawal? Do I just require higher vit d levels being latino & from Florida keys where I would naturally get far more sun? If my mag is giving me slight breathlessness too, could it just be hypercalcemia instead? I’m genuinely so tired of the back and forth but this low mood & low self image is affecting my job and it is directly correlated with my vit d intake.. has anyone else stopped and will my mood eventually go back to normal (like withdrawal) ? Should I just try a much lower does of vit d? I’m on one week right now & while I can breath, I have no motivation, it’s a butch getting up in the morning, brain fog, & I need like 3x the amount of coffee to function. Last note, what solidified vit d being the cause for sure is my sad mood hits like a bus right at sunset… clearly telling me my levels have dropped. 

Please help if anyone can relate or what I should do, I never thought my dumb ahh would somehow get addicted to vit d lmaoo ",1,1728315165.0,VitaminD,4,1.0,False
1fyaid0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1fyaid0/confused/,Confused ,"So when I was dating my husband he wrote me poems. He sent me messages all the time that were so sweet they’d make you melt. I always wanted to be loved whole heartedly. Like I was the most important person in the world to that person. And I believed I had found just that. He’d hold my hand in stores and when he was on a work trip and still found someone to deliver me flowers on Valentine’s Day cause he couldn’t. 

But once we were married things changed. We’ve been married for almost 3 years now and he never wrote me another poem or bought me flowers again. I married him because he was so sweet and caring and now he’s so different. He refuses to hold my hand more than 5 seconds because he says he doesn’t like holding hands. I asked why he held my hand when we dated and now now. And he says he doesn’t have to try anymore because we’re married. He gets upset if I try to cuddle with him too much. Just the other day he asked me to make him a coffee and I was teasingly like “oh what do I get?” “I’m not going to give you anything for a 10cent coffee.” “I don’t want stuff from you. But we could go cuddle and watch a movie or you could tell me something sweet.” “I’m not gonna blow smoke up your ass and I don’t want to lay down.” “Oh…okay.” 

We did end up cuddling later so I guess he did show up. but I just don’t know if this is what I want anymore. Is there any advice on how to improve this situation or should I adjust my expectations?",1,1728315118.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

Since the beginning the endocrinologist has recommended a dozen different vitamins and supplements, she's basically saying throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. 

Well, nothing is sticking so I've  decided to cut out sodas, flavored waters, and drinking our of plastic through the end of the year. It's impossible to cut out all plastic, but I can do this. Maybe. I can usually go 4-6 weeks max on a new thing before  I revert so Ive given myself a *huge* challenge. Also, I drink soda and flavored water pretty much exclusively so switching to plain water, soy milk (I'm lactose intolerant), and coffee is going to be a biiiiig change.

Wanna know why I love crypto transactions? After switching to cryptocurrency, there’s no going back! It’s simply the best option for online gambling. First off, crypto gives you real privacy. Unlike using credit cards or bank transfers, which require you to hand over all your personal details, crypto transactions are much more discreet. You just send it from your wallet, and that's it.

Another thing is speed. With regular bank transfers, especially international ones, you could be waiting days for your withdrawals to come through. I’ve had to sit there and watch the clock. But with crypto? It’s almost instant—depositing and withdrawing within minutes, no hassle. One time, I cashed out and had my winnings in my wallet before I even finished my coffee.

Fees are another huge plus. I used to cringe at the charges for using traditional payment methods, especially when gambling on international sites. But with crypto, the transaction fees are minimal, which means more of my winnings stay with me. Overall, it’s faster, safer, and just easier. For me, crypto is the ultimate game-changer in online gambling.",2,1728314905.0,Cryptocherryreels,1,1.0,False

>COMMANDER

>Damn, guess I really did get the wrong girl...Anyways, I couldn't help but notice back in Bohnsdorf how you managed to quickly treat someone about to succumb to ELID infection. I'm going to pretend that my dolls didn't do this exact thing to me back in Sector 11 when I was exposed to the dirty bomb, and make this out like you have a magical ELID cure for Kalina that is going to justify me abandoning all common sense and falling into an obvious trap later on.

>

>MACHLIAN

>Yes, I'm able to cure ELID. I have spent the last few years in Bohnsdorf treating as many refugees as I can, because it's the right thing to do with the ability I have.

>

>COMMANDER

>How can you manage to do that?

>

>MACHLIAN

>I would tell you, but I still don't fully trust that you aren't some spy from Paradeus.

>

>COMMANDER

>Jesus Christ, woman! You have spent five years in a village where they shout their affiliations with Paradeus from the rooftops every five minutes! How the hell did that little detail manage to slip your attention for years?!

MACHLIAN suddenly SLUMPS OVER UNCONSCIOUS AGAIN.

>COMMANDER

>Not again...

>

>DANDELION

>Well, I suppose now would be a good time to point out that she is a Nyto, and I can hack into her mind and sift through her memories.

>

>ST AR-15

>Wait, what?! Why couldn't you just do that earlier?! Why didn't you tell us that she was a Nyto and could have ripped Team Griffin and their pea-shooters to shreds while we were gone?! Why did we waste time letting the Commander drag us along for a pointless meeting with Ange when we're racing against the clock to stop an imminent Terror attack?!

>

>COMMANDER

>Shut up, Star. Hack her, Dandelion.

DANDELION HACKS into MACHLIAN

A MEMORY appears WHEREVER THE HELL THE COMMANDER CAN SEE IT FROM. MACHLIAN and A LITTLE GIRL are TALKING in BOHNSDORF

>LITTLE GIRL

>Hey, Machlian! Look at how cute and innocent I am! Wouldn't it just be such a tragedy if I died horribly and meaninglessly later in the event?

>

>MACHLIAN

>Yeah, that would suck even more than if my entire role in this story was to serve as cheap character development to the protagonist after I get impaled by my evil twin sister.

>

>COMMANDER

>This isn't getting us anywhere, next.

ANOTHER MEMORY begins PLAYING, showing MACHLIAN STRAPPED to a GURNEY in a GRIMY LAB.

>WILLIAM

>I know I've already been established as the most amoral and ruthless war criminal in the history of mankind, but apparently the writers still don't think I'm evil enough yet. I hope you like getting tortured while I remind you that I turned your parents into zombies. God, I have such a massive fucking boner right now.

>

>COMMANDER

>Oh, look, his face is conveniently blurred out. You know, I don't really get why hiding it is such a big deal now. He's obviously not somebody I know, so why are the writers still blurring out his portrait even after both Ange and I have seen him in person? Anyways, next!

ANOTHER MEMORY STARTS.

>NARCISS

>Alright everyone. I need you to take these devices that are called Iaso's Boxes that are designed to saturate areas with radioactive zombie pollen, and plant them in these places inside of Berlin. You see this map here with all of them on it? Be sure to look *very* closely at it!

>

>COMMANDER

>Okay, that's more like it, are there any others?

ANOTHER MEMORY PLAYS. ALL of the TERRORIST ATTACKS PARADEUS wants to COMMIT in BERLIN play out in EXCRUTIATING DETAIL. IASO'S BOXES DETONATE ABOVE and UNDER BERLIN, the QUARANTINE WALL EXPLODES.

>ST AR-15

>Wait, what the hell?! That obviously didn't happen yet!

>

>DANDELION

>It's a memory from the future, obviously.

>

>ST AR-15

>But– No, that's stupid! You can't just drop something like that and expect us all to just go with it! Did we really just go from having a sci-fi setting that, although taking place 40 years in the future, still felt grounded and familiar, and operated with rules identical to the real world, to just casually dropping that time travel magic and clairvoyance exists?

>

>DANDELION

>Don't worry, give it a few more events and we'll be so deep in unexplained semi-mystical bullshit that even this will seem like nothing.

>

>ST AR-15

>Well, in any event, there's our terrorist attacks. Let's give Ange a call and bring her up to speed on what Paradeus's plans are and the type of dirty bomb they plan on using.

>

>COMMANDER

>Nuh-uh.

>

>ST AR-15

>The fuck you mean “nuh-uh”?!

>

>COMMANDER

>The writers really want to push that slim pretense of non- linearity for this, so we're going have both of our storylines completely branch off and we will both discover the exact same things through different means.

>

>ST AR-15

>That makes no sense from either perspective! From a story perspective, we look like idiots because we never call anything in and run off on our own without cuing the other in on vital information that could save valuable time while we're urgently rushing to save thousands of lives, and from a gameplay perspective, we're wasting the player's time by making them sit through hours of redundant dialogue!

FEDOROV pulls out a BASEBALL BAT and GLARES at ST AR-15

>ST AR-15

>(Groaning) Fine, I'll shut up!

>

>COMMANDER

>Anyway, we're done here. Wake her back up.

>

DANDELION SMACKS MACHLIAN, JARRING HER AWAKE

>MACHLIAN

>(Sitting up) AAAHH! GET AWAY FROM ME PARADEUS SCUM!

>

>COMMANDER

>Calm down! I told you we're not Paradeus!

>

>MACHLIAN

>I don't believe you! I will never trust another word you say ever again!

>

>ST AR-15

>Motherfucker, we pulled you out of a settlement that had every square inch of it packed with some kind of Paradeus death-squad, who started swarming us like we stepped in an anthill the moment the Commander grabbed you, your appearance is a one-to-one match of a known Paradeus infiltrator, and now, on top of all of that, we just yanked detailed step-by-step plans of how Paradeus plans to set off a dirty bomb inside the city out of your head. Bitch, how do *we* know that *you're* not with Paradeus?!

>

>COMMANDER

>Star, stop being mean. Look at her! She isn't some Assassin, she looks so pure and innocent.

>

>ST AR-15

>THAT'S WHAT ASSASSINS ARE TRAINED TO DO! THEY USE MANIPULATION AND DECEPTION TO GET CLOSE TO THEIR TARGETS AND ELUDE SUSPICION AFTER THE DEED IS DONE! YOU CAN'T JUST LET YOUR GUARD DOWN BECAUSE SHE GIVES YOU PUPPY-EYES AND CROCODILE TEARS!

>

>COMMANDER

>Alright there, miss conspiracy. Why don't you go slide under some aluminum foil where the lizard people can't get you?

>

>ST AR-15

>(Groans) At least ask her about the dirty bombs!

>

>COMMANDER

>...Right. **Ahem**...Machlian...PLEASE TELL ME WHERE THE BOMBS ARE! IF THEY GO OFF WHEN I'VE BEEN TASKED TO STOP THEM, I'LL LOOK VERY STUPID IN FRONT OF ANGE...Oh, and I guess a lot of people will die and stuff...

>

>MACHLIAN

>I'd tell you, but my memories are scrambled. I can't reliably tell you anything about what Paradeus is planning.

>

>ST AR-15

>Well isn't that convenient...

>

>COMMANDER

>Oh well, can't be helped. Now, how did you cure ELID back in the camp? It is very important that you tell me how.

>

>MACHLIAN

>Well, you see, I use my blood, except the blood is just the base for the medicine, and it needs to be processed with special machinery.

>

>COMMANDER

>It would sure be inconvenient if you didn't have any more of that medicine, but seeing that you were on your way to treat people afflicted with ELID when I grabbed you, you have some of this medicine on you, right?

>

>MACHLIAN

>(Shaking head) Actually, I only had one vial, and I gave it to that person who collapsed during the speech. I just went over to the medical tent to tell the patients to their face that they were totally boned now.

>

>ST AR-15

>You went into a refugee camp, the residents of which were majority ELID infected desperately waiting for a miracle cure that was promised to them, with only just enough dosage of the medicine to cure a single person?

>

>MACHLIAN

>I'm afraid that you're just going to have to accept that.

After FORCING THEMSELVES to ACCEPT that a CORE CONFLICT of the story MAKES NO SENSE, THE COMMANDER and ST AR-15 CALL IT A DAY.

CUT TO:

INT. ANGE'S APARTMENT

TEAM DEFY and LIGHT meet to DISCUSS their NEXT MOVE

>ANGE

>So, it turns out Leone doesn't know anything else. Who else can we beat up?

>

>LIGHT

>Well, that guy Powell's still in prison. Apart from Morridow, he's the last lead from the previous operation.

>

>ANGE

>Get me into the prison, I'm going to go beat him up again.

>

>LIGHT

>What do you think that'll do?

>

>ANGE

>Sometimes you just have to shake the tree and see what falls out.

>

>LIGHT

>Alright, let's make it quick though, my Mom's going to be worried if I don't make it home in time for dinner tonight.

>

FADE TO:

INT. BERLIN PRISON – A FEW HOURS LATER

ANGE makes her way into the PRISON and meets with a PRISON GUARD

>PRISON GUARD

>Alright, Miss Tsoi, before you can meet with the prisoner, you need to undergo a rigorous vetting process. I want you to hold up your right hand and say that you won't abuse the prisoner.

>

>ANGE

>(Holding up right hand) I promise not to abuse the prisoner.

>

>PRISON GUARD

>Hmmm...Yeah, good enough. You can go through now.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM – BERLIN PRISON

ANGE and LIGHT enter the INTERROGATION ROOM where POWELL is sitting.

>ANGE

>Powell...Why are you still wearing that same suit from the last event in prison?

>

>POWELL

>My sprite is literally a recycled asset from previous seasonal events, do you really need me to spell it out?

>

>ANGE

>I guess it was stupid of me to ask, anyways, on to the real questions. Alright, Light, turn off your body-cam.

As LIGHT SWITCHES OFF his BODY-CAM, ANGE LUNGES at POWELL and begins BEATING HIM SENSELESS.

>ANGE

>TELL ME WHERE THE BOMB IS! WHO ARE YOU WORKING FOR?! GIVE ME THE NAMES!

ANGE PUNCHES, SLAMS, AND SMASHES POWELL'S FACE into TABLES, WALLS, and THE FLOOR as POWELL tries to SAY SOMETHING through a BROKEN JAW and SWOLLEN GUMS. Suddenly, after another BLOW TO THE HEAD, POWELL DROPS TO THE FLOOR CONVULSING AND SPASMING.

>LIGHT

>JESUS CHRIST!

POWELL continues VIOLENTLY SEIZING until he FALLS LIMP, his EYES ROLLED BACK.

>ANGE

>Uh...Oops...

>

>LIGHT

>I think he's dead...

>

>ANGE

>You can cover this up, right? Just, say he fell and hit his head on the table...about 10 to 12 times?

>

>LIGHT

>I might not even have to do that considering how grossly incompetent all other relevant authorities have been lately. He'll probably be rotting in here for weeks before anybody even gets around to cleaning up the body.

>

>ANGE

>Well, I guess it would be too much to hope that he kept a journal around detailing all of his diabolical plans...

As ANGE LOOTS POWELL'S CORPSE, she suddenly finds a VIAL of HALLUCOGENIC POLLEN

>ANGE

>What the hell? It's that hallucogenic pollen he was using back in Bremen. How did he get this in here?

>

>LIGHT

>Like I said, I'm kind of the only person here who knows what they're doing.

>

>ANGE

>Well, I'm going to play this off as an actionable lead, it's not like anything I do in this side of the story is actually going to matter.

FADE TO:

INT. ANGE'S APARTMENT – A SHORT WHILE LATER

ANGE and DEFY once again PLOT THEIR NEXT MOVE.

>ANGE

>So, I didn't get anything about any kind of terrorist attack, but he did somehow manage to smuggle some of that hallucinogenic pollen from Bremen inside the prison. I'm going to assume Paradeus had something to do with that, so, AK-12, I need you to go and figure out who is smuggling drugs into Berlin's Prison. I want you back here in two hours with the good news.

>

>AK-12

>Ange, I am a Russian Tactical Doll who has only been in the country for a couple of weeks and this city for a couple of days. How am I supposed to track down a handful of smugglers in a city of 3.4 million people that is 900 square Kilometers big in two hours?

>

>ANGE

>We're going to do the writing thing where we chalk it up to you just being *that* good and hope the audience overlooks how horribly implausible the feat you've accomplished is.

>

>AK-12

>Works for me, I guess.

That HAPPENS, and AK-12 RETURNS in TWO HOURS.

>AK-12

>All of the drugs are coming from a Galatea warehouse outside of town owned by Gray Blackwell.

>

>ANGE

>Excellent, let's go.

>

>AK-12

>Wait, *right now?*

>

>ANGE

>Time's wasting, no time to even inform Light about this.

>

>AK-12

>But-

ANGE CHANGES THE SCENE before AK-12 can VOICE HER OBJECTION.

CUT TO:

EXT. GALATEA WAREHOUSE – BERLIN OUTSKIRTS

ANGE and TEAM DEFY MATERIALIZE in the YARD outside the WAREHOUSE.

>AK-12

>Alright, first off – Why are you even here?! Not only are you a human who is physically incapable of keeping up with us, but you are *injured.* Not only are you useless, you are an active liability by tagging along.

>

>ANGE

>I need to see the evidence with my own eyes, 12.

>

>AK-12

>Ange, I am literally a walking camcorder that is programmed to be unconditionally loyal to you.

>

>ANGE

>But-

>

>AK-12

>*Second*, have you already forgotten about what happened following Bremen? You are a foreign national that is breaking into private property without a warrant. Any evidence we find in there will be deemed contaminated and inadmissible.

>

>ANGE

>But The Earl-

>

>AK-12

>Yes, exactly. Why do we need to secure the warehouse in the first place? Look, those people walking in and out of the Warehouse are clearly Nytos – illegally modified cyborgs that only Paradeus can fabricate and deploy. We can just send our visual feeds to him, and Galatea and Gray will be flagged as Paradeus agents.

>

>ANGE

>It's not that simple, 12.

>

>AK-12

>Not that simple how? Either the legal system of this country is going to flag any evidence we find as null and void because we are illegally raiding this place, or this is an autocratic dystopia where the Government can make anybody disappear on the mere suspicion of treason. Which is it?

>

>ANGE

>…

>

>AK-12

>Come on. Back over the fence. We'll send the footage we have back to Griffin and have Gray put on his hit-list, and as punishment, no ice cream for a month.

As ANGE and AK-12 are about to LEAVE, YUZHONG suddenly RUNS UP and SHOVES both ANGE and AK-12 onto a CATAPUALT, and LAUNCHES THEM into the DEAD CENTER of the WAREHOUSE. THEY CRASH through the CEILING into the middle of an ARMY of PARADEUS GOONS.

>AK-12

>Or, I guess we're going to duke it out in here anyways...

After suffering through another AWFUL COMBAT NODE involving WAVE AFTER WAVE of MONTONOUS FIGHTS with PRE-SET ECHELONS, ANGE and DEFY EMERGE VICTORIOUS. However, when they move to the next STORY NODE, ANGE and 12 suddenly find themselves BARELY CONSCIOUS OUTSIDE.

>ANGE

>Wait..what happened?

>

>AK-12

>They're doing the stupid video game thing where they make you fight a battle, but then after you kill the last enemy, they play a cutscene where you lose anyways.

>

>ANGE

>Fantastic...

ANGE looks up to see GRAY as well as a HORDE of PARADEUS MERCENARIES and DIRTY COPS SWARMING AROUND HER and REMOVING THE EVIDENCE.

>GRAY

>Bwa ha ha! Behold! I'm doing the supervillain thing where I show up in person to gloat to your face instead of telling my men to just waste you on the spot. Sure nothing will-

Suddenly, LIGHT runs onto the scene with a SEARCH WARRANT and a SQUAD OF STASI AGENTS.

>LIGHT

>Hey, Ange! I got that search warrant!

>

>GRAY

>D'oh!

>

>ANGE

>Thank God, tell these guys to drop those bodies and stop contaminating the crime scene.

LIGHT SMILES AWKWARDLY and RUBS THE BACK OF HIS NECK.

>LIGHT

>Eh-he...you see, this search warrant doesn't authorize me to actually search anything or detain anyone, so, these guys are kind of free to tamper with any evidence to their hearts content...

>

>AK-12

>For fuck's sake! You guys are the *Stasi! The Secret Police!* Are you telling me that you guys have no problem going around kidnapping and torturing suspected dissidents until they confess under duress, but stopping third parties from removing evidence from an active crime scene is beyond your authority?! Come on, guys! You can't just be all “Call the cops, oh wait hahaha” when you're screwing *us* over, but then act like your hands are knotted up in red-tape when there are terrorists smuggling bioweapons right in front of you! What kind of police state dictatorship is this?!

>

>LIGHT

>We don't care about being consistent, we just make sure that this country is as miserable of a place to live as humanly possible. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to go tell my men to stand around uselessly.

>

>AK-12

>Oh well...At least we have our recorded feeds of the Nytos in and around the warehouse registered in Gray's name loading up bioweapons as well as Gray herself gloating at the center of it. Let's upload this to Griffin so he can mobilize people against her.

>

>ANGE

>Fuck that. She's made this personal, so we're settling this mano-a-mano

>AK-12

>...I'm calling my fucking agent.

CUT TO:

EXT. BERLIN OUTSKIRTS – A WHILE LATER

GRAY sits in a CONVOY of MERCS and POLICE OFFICERS.

>OFFICER

>Alright Miss Gray, we're at where you wanted us to take you. Why are you having us stop in the middle of nowhere?

>

>GRAY

>I'm angry that Angelia might be potentially on to me, so in order to vent my frustrations about being cast under suspicion, so I'm going to murder a dozen sworn police officers for no reason.

NYTOS and STRELETS suddenly JUMP out of the bushes and TURN THE COPS that were LAST SEEN with GRAY INTO MINCEMEAT.

>GRAY

>Bwa-ha-ha! I'm sure this will avert me coming under rigorous scrutiny by the authorities now that a dozen police officers who were last seen with me have turned up dead! My evil plan to destroy the city that I work in and is being used as the headquarters for the company I am using to carry out vital research for Father's ultimate goal is going perfectly! I am an evil genius!

>

CUT TO:

INT. ANGE'S APARTMENT – A WHILE LATER

ANGE and LIGHT arrive at ANGE'S APARTMENT

>LIGHT

>Well, Ange, I know you went off on your own and completely screwed over our investigation because you couldn't wait five minutes for me to get a warrant signed, but I just wanted to say that I forgive you and have complete faith in your judgment. You are my idol, after all.

>

>ANGE

>I'm sorry...

>

>AK-12

>Please tell me you're going to upload the footage we have to Griffin now.

>

>ANGE

>I have a better idea.

>

>AK-12

>Such as?

>

>ANGE

>We're going to go to her office and shoot her.

>

>AK-12

>We can do that?

>

>ANGE

>I'm out of other ideas.

>

>AK-12

>Have you been listening to a word I say? Do you really think The Earl, the physical embodiment of “The end justifies the means” is going to drag his feet and let Gray run amok once you tip him off? That doesn't make any-

>

Suddenly, a STRELET CRASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW. AK-12 quickly SHOOTS IT DEAD.

>AK-12

>Okay, what the fuck?! That's a *Strelet –* an ELID creature encased in power armor in the middle of downtown Berlin! We've spent this entire event running around trying to figure out what kind of Space-Age technology Paradeus has developed that would allow them to smuggle Epiphylla through the state-of-the- art scanners employed by the Quarantine perimeter, come to find out that Paradeus can just march ELIDS toting power armor and automatic weapons straight into the town square without raising a brow anywhere! What is this bullshit?!

RPK BURSTS INTO THE ROOM

>RPK-16

>We've got a problem! They've gunned down the Stasi agents on the lower floors and have set the building on fire!

>

>AK-12

>Holy shit, they just gunned down a dozen Federal Agents in broad daylight *and* burned down a building used to house foreign dignitaries. Anybody suspected of being affiliated with Paradeus is probably going to get dragged off to a Black-site now and never see the light of day again. We could probably just leave town at this point and let this problem take care of itself.

>

>ANGE

>Forget that for now, how do we get out of here?!

>

>RPK-16

>I'm afraid that Paradeus has encircled the building and is watching the fire escape, and our backup won't arrive fast enough before the flames reach us. The only way is for one of us to stay behind and draw their fire while you slip out.

>

>ANGE

>RPK, we're inside an *apartment building*. There is a narrow hallway and a central staircase, where the hell are you going to draw their fire to? Furthermore, how am I going to get outside with Paradeus encircling the building?

>

>RPK-16

>You're not. You're going to go down to a lower floor and hold out there until backup can arrive.

>

>ANGE

>But the building's *on fire* and the reason you just gave as to why we can't just hunker down here and funnel them in to be cut down in a choke-point is that the fire will reach us before backup arrives! How will moving to a *lower-floor* where the fire is more intense increase my odds of survival when common-sense dictates it would do the *exact opposite*?!

>

>AK-12

>(Sigh) Ange, I have something to tell you. I just got off the phone with my agent, I'm getting out of this stupid event. Naturally, this means that the writers had to shit out some kind of contrived reason for me to be left behind in the face of insurmountable odds and be left to an ambiguous fate. So, as they say in America: “See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya”.

>

>ANGE

>(Dumbfounded) Wha-?!

AK-12 KICKS ANGE out of the WINDOW and sends her PLUMMETING DOWN into a DUMPSTER, where BAGS OF TRASH BREAK HER FALL.

EXT. ANGE'S APARTMENT – MOMENTS LATER

TEAM DEFY FISHES ANGE out of the DUMPSTER

>AN-94

>Ange, there you are.

>

>ANGE

>Where's 12?...

>

THE TEAM looks solemnly at ANGE

>AN-94

>I'm sorry, Ange. I tried to hold her back, but she kept screaming about how she couldn't take it anymore and ran straight into the flames.

>

>ANGE

>...And Light?...

>

>AK-15

>What about him? Were we supposed to protect him too?

>

The TOP OF THE BUILDING suddenly FUCKING EXPLODES

>AK-15

>...Crap.

>ANGE

>God, I hope the Commander's investigation is going better...

CUT TO:

INT. GRIFFIN'S SAFEHOUSE – DINING ROOM

THE COMMANDER moves MACHLIAN into the FRAME of a CAMERA

>COMMANDER

>Alright, Machlian, it's time to introduce yourself to the rest of Griffin. Be sure to let everyone know how happy you are to be alive and how much you look forward to the future! Just trust me.

ST AR-15 and DANDELION stand over a sleeping MACHLIAN

>ST AR-15

>Alright, Dandelion, patch me in to her virtual brain thingy and let me dig through her memories myself.

>DANDELION

>Only if you let me tease you about your friend who has been missing for weeks.

>

>ST AR-15

>You have no idea how much I wish killing you would accomplish something meaningful...Fine, I accept, now do it.

>

ST AR-15 ENTERS MACHLIAN'S MIND and immediately finds a HIDDEN MEMORY. MORRIDOW stands in front of a DEAD BODY.

>MORRIDOW

>Haha, I just totally murdered you – the REAL Morridow Voigt. I can't wait to take your place as the Chairwoman's Secretary and have that Ivan bitch completely bamboozled!

>

ANOTHER MEMORY PLAYS, MORRIDOW stands in front of a VILLAGE covered in ALIEN ZOMBIE POLLEN.

>VILLAGER

>I have done as you asked, Lady Morridow, and murdered all of my friends and family as well as destroyed the only home I know for no reason at all.

>

>MORRIDOW

>Awesome, I'm going to kill you too now!

>

>VILLAGER

>Huh? But what about the feet pi-

>

MORRIDOW SLICES the VILLAGER CLEAN IN HALF like an ANIME NINJA and LICKS THE BLOOD from her BLADE.

>MORRIDOW

>Wait...I can't get Hepatitis, can I? I'd look pretty stupid if I could...

>

>ST AR-15

>Holy shit! She *is* Morridow! I need to tell the Commander right now!

CUT TO:

INT. GRIFFIN'S SAFEHOUSE – COMMANDER'S OFFICE

ST AR-15 RUSHES into the OFFICE.

>ST AR-15

>Commander! I found memories inside Machlian's brain that had been sealed off! They clearly show her acting as Morridow and killing Chairwoman Ulrich's secretary, bombing villages out in the wasteland, burning down orphanages, and throwing litters of puppies into vats of acid!

>

THE COMMANDER suddenly starts LAUGHING.

>COMMANDER

>AHAHAHAHAHA! HEY STAR, SOMEONE DREW ON YOUR FACE, BAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

>

>ST AR-15

>GOD DAMN IT, COMMANDER! THIS IS SERIOUS! SHE IS AN ASSASSIN WHO HAS BEEN FOOLING YOU THE ENTIRE TIME!

>

>DANDELION

>Actually, she isn't. You see, Nytos Virtual Consciousnesses are scrambled by their very nature, and sometimes memories from other Nytos can just randomly appear in there for no reason.

>

>ST AR-15

>NONE OF US EVEN KNEW THESE BRAND NEW ELITE NYTOS EVEN EXISTED BEFORE YESTERDAY, HOW DO YOU JUST SUDDENLY KNOW THIS?! HOW DO YOU HAVE ANY DATA WHATSOEVER TO CROSS-REFERENCE AND VERIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS?! ARE YOU ONE OF THEM TOO?!

So the reason why I'm posting here is because yesterday I think my brother didn't like how I babysat his daughter. Now mind you, he worked from 9am - 6pm on Sunday, but I had that day off from work, and since I was gonna be home I said I could babysit. 

(Keep in mind, I'm currently enrolled as a full-time student and work part-time, this is important to mention because I don't earn as much income to support with rent. To make for this, me and my bro came up with an agreement where I'll pick drop off and pick up his daughter from school (we take the bus).
Also, I can't apply for income assistance as a student).

Which leads us to yesterday, I woke up at 7am and chilled in my room for the morning because I heard my brother getting ready for work and heard my niece doing her lil morning routine. There was one or two times when he angrily knocked on my door and even though I responded that I was up, he still was pissed off that I wasn't out there. Also mind you, we just moved into this place a week ago.

I was in a little bit of a sour mood afterwards because I was having a good morning up until then, when someone expects you to be mad but you're not, then continues to insist that you're mad, Eventually you'll get mad - or pissed off as I was in this situation.

So I came out of my room and stood around since we don't have a kitchen table to sit at, I could have sat in the living room but there's like 2 seats available and the rest is covered in him and his daughters unpacked clothes thrown around.

Just before he left to work he reminded me to feed her, which, obviously. So at 9am she was chilling in the living room and I made her a bowl of cereal, she floated around me while I was grabbing the stuff. Then eventually we made our way to the living room and I used a box as a temporary coffee table and gave her the cereal. She was chill and munched on it while watching YouTube and I returned to my room to watch TikToks. (My room doesn't have my PC or Desk set up, only my bed and chair.) (Living rook has the PS5 and TV hooked up.)

Eventually 12pm came and I came out again to make her lunch, which was Mac and cheese (she only likes her safe foods). The thing is, her dad and her complain that I make it ""wrong"" even though I follow the exact instructions and to me, it tastes fine. So to avoid that complication, I have my niece add the ingredients and mix them, that way she SEES that we followed the instructions to a T.
(Mind you, she's been playing Minecraft until then and she enjoys cooking.). 

So when the Mac and cheese was done, I gave her ⅔ of the serving (one box) cause she absorbs it instantly lol. Then I took ⅓ for myself. So she went back to the living room and I went back to my room (again, door open).

At around 3pm she asks for a snack, so we go to the fridge and I get her small box of blueberries and she washes them off. Then I head to the living room and make sure everything's still going OK here. She's watching YouTube at this point and is munching on her blueberries. Once making sure she's still vibing, I head to my room again.

At 5pm I start to make supper for her, which is Chicken nuggets and Fry's. Since we had just moved in this week and the management cleaned everything before moving in, turning on the oven smelt like real rank chemicals for a few min. For that time, I opened the screen door in the living room a bit and opened my bedroom window a bit too. (It was a cold day yesterday, hence not opening it fully). 

In less than 10min the smell cleared and I tossed in her food. Then once it finished I took it out and made our plates, with again, giving her the larger portion cause I'm taking care of her, not myself.
(Also note, she has been drinking water throughout the day). 

Eventually at 6:40pm my brother returned and I was like ""swag, she was chilling throughout the day and ate all her meals."" And then I went to my room again, but this time I closed the door.

-

Which leads us towards the evening and today (the next morning). This past month Ive recently been trying to change my emotional responses to situations, instead of seeing myself as ""the victim"" (since that was the response my parents always forced onto me.) I've been trying to change my perspective into ""What can I do to help myself?"". Basically, I'm rewiring my thinking and self perception, which is taking a tole on me because instead of defaulting to my normal response, I'm having to quickly analyze my emotions, then redirect them. As a result, I'm left with a enormous amount ""Energy A"" but I'm now trying to change to ""Energy B"".... which means that now my ""Energy A"" has no where to go.

Which, usually when I hit a roadblock like this I'd go for a long walk or draw... except that I couldn't go for a long walk cause I was babysitting, and I couldn't draw because I didn't have my notebooks or my PC. So my go-to outlets for ""Energy A"" are gone.

So throughout yesterday my ""Energy A"" stocks were building and building. But since I had no outlet, I was just holding in all that tension. Because again, I've recently changed to ""Energy B"". My responses and actions have been much more direct; meaning that I'm actually able to get things done. Which is better when compared to the previous months.

(Energy A ""victim"" = Not helping myself, self sabatoge)

(Energy B ""Solver"" = Helping myself, changing my self image and esteem.)

-

So when my brother came back, I went to my room, chilled for a moment, then grabbed my headphones and went for a VERY LONG walk/adventure to decompress. And by that I mean I walked 6km then hopped on random buses, then walked back home for like 2km. So I would've been gone for like 4hrs. During that time I just kept think and thinking because that's what ""Energy A"" would do, but it wasn't self sabatoge thinking but rather just erry clarity of mind, so slowly turning ""Energy A"" to ""B"". 

By the time I was near home, I had calmed down. So I went to the store and got my brother a cup of coffee since he had asked, then I also bought myself a sandwich and munched on it for a bit. Then I went back home, gave him his coffee, then went to my room.

-

Alr the thing is, I used to HATE kids. But in these last couple of years, I've begun to be ok with them, I'm chill with my nieces and nephews now. (The other day me and my niece were at the park and somehow in less than 20min I had become a random adopted auntie to like 4 kids who wanted me to watch their scooters and push them on the swings lmao)

It's just- ahhhHHHHH!!!!

I would remind my niece throughout the day that I love her and care for her, and she'd be like ""yee, love you too auntie"". But AHHHHH.

How is it that my old behaviour WASN'T enough, but now my newer one isn't either???
Also, mental illness is a thing to mentions to add more context.

Me = SzPD and ADHD
Bro = BPD, MDD and ADHD
Niece = ADHD...?",1,1728314765.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

I am planning to visit Monterey with my SO, this October 23 - 25, 2025 (Wednesday to Friday), coming from Canada!

I understand I have packed a lot in to this Itinerary, and would like to see as much as possible, without things being too draining. If you have any honest opinions or re-directions, general tips (parking, restaurants, etc.), please let me know, I would appreciate it greatly!

**Day 1 - Wednesday, October 23:**

* Arrive at SFO \~ 11:15am
* Pick up rental car \~ 12:30pm
* Drive to Monterey - Route from SFO to Monterey (Highway 1): with these stops:
   * Pacifica (check out the Taco Bell)
   * Moss Beach - Moss Beach Distillery
   * Half Moon Bay
   * Pescadero - Pigeon Point Lighthouse
      * Pie Ranch
   * Stop at Swanton Berry Farm near Davenport, right before Santa Cruz. 
   * Davenport - Shark Fin Cove
   * Santa Cruz (check out the Boardwalk)
   * Moss Landing: Check out Phil's Fish Market/The Power Plant Coffee
* Check in to hotel and drop off luggage
* [17-mile drive](https://www.pebblebeach.com/17-mile-drive/) (\~ 1 hour)
* Monterey fish house for Dinner
* Check out Cannery Row/Old Fisherman’s Wharf
* Sunset at Asilomar State Beach

**Day 2 - Thursday, October 24:**

* Wake up 7am, find breakfast (recommendations?)
* Drive to [Big Sur](https://anappleaplane.com/things-to-do-at-big-sur/) and make stops here:
   * Point Lobos State Park:
      * Cypress Grove Trail
      * Point Lobos State Park – Sea Lion Point Trail
      * Point Lobos State Park – Bird Island Trail
   * Calla Lily Valley
   * Rocky Creek Bridge Vista Point
   * Bixby Creek Bridge
   * Pfeiffer Beach (purple sand), Pfeiffer Falls Trail
   * Lunch at Nepenthe Restaurant
   * Henry Miller Memorial Library
   * Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park - McWay Falls
* Drive and park at Carmel-By-The-Sea, walk around.
* Sunset at Carmel State Beach/other beach
* Drive back to hotel in Monterey
* Walk somewhere in Monterey for dinner

**Day 3 - Friday, October 25:**

* The Butter House in Monterey for breakfast
* Drive back to SFO (either via Highway 1 or the other faster route). Leave early (?)
* Make some stops in Santa Cruz (?)
* Return rental car by 12:30 pm
* Continue with SF itinerary

I know this might be a lot but I'm wondering if I can get some guidance on what to take out/replace, if its too much. There is a lot to see and do and its our first time coming to CA! I think its better to take more time and enjoy each spot without rushing too much. 

**My questions:**

1. Potential traffic from SFO to Monterey along Highway 1 at \~12:30pm? What can I expect on the Wednesday?

2. Restaurant recommendations for all 3 days? Bfast/Lunch/Dinner, nothing too fancy or expensive, please!

3. Parking situation - I might be in a pickup truck like a Tacoma - what parking options can I expect at places like Point Lobos/Bixby Bridge/Pfeiffer Beach/Carmel-By-The-Sea? We are going during the weekday so hoping traffic it not too bad.

4. Are there fees for entering some of the stops in Big Sur? or for parking? I know 17-mile drive is a fee per car but I'm not sure about places like Bixby Bridge/Pfeiffer State Park for McWay falls, etc.

5. Timing of stops - best time of the day to see McWay Falls/Bixby Bridge? I know there might be fog, but we can't control that!

6. Given some of the road closures, I think we should be fine since all of the stops are before Esalen Institute?

Please feel free to offer any additions, suggestions, or modifications to my trip. Thank you so much for the help!",0,1728314753.0,MontereyBay,6,0.33,False

* the cardboard boat race
* the farmer’s market (this Thursday is the last week) not snooty or elite like other markets and they take EBT cards

Why would he do this other than an attempt at manipulation.,"little background, I ended a nearly 2 year relationship. good man, bad fit. met when I was an incoming freshman, barely 18, he was 20. broke up a month ago, but we agreed to be friends. I ended things for 2 big reasons, all of which he knows:

- I could not grow with him as he wasn't at the same place, we were in different worlds. I had trouble letting him into my head.

- I realized I did not know myself, and I hated that I did not know who I was. I couldn't let him love me if I could not truly love myself 

so a month passes and we get coffee, and at the end he asks me to take the clothing I BOUGHT FOR HIM and his journal from the day we broke up to the day we met up. He said I did not have to take these things, but in the heat of the moment I agreed. On the drive back to my house I found myself thinking that it was shitty of him to do. We want to be friends, why would he give me this? The book is heavy with emotion, his words are heavy and genuine, but I don't think we can laugh about the end in 3 years when I read so much of it. 

I went cover to cover. He said that he highlighted passages that were written in anger so i would not have to stumble into them, so naturally I read them first. The book boiled down all my feelings to the initial breakup to, ""*God, if only you were a little different. We could've worked out.*"" I don't want him back. It hasn't changed that.

However, my feelings on him as a person changed.  Only ex lovers or erotic rivals give each other a book of letters that are full of such pain and emotion. It feels like his last ditch effort to connect with me, and kind of fuckin manipulative. He has attachment issues and his last two girlfriends cut him out completely, so I get why he is being so... desperate. But jeez man, he's trying to talk to me everyday.

I’m pregnant at the moment and there are so many new triggers. If it’s just me, I can usually move on eventually but now any contamination involves my baby.

Yesterday I went to a coffee shop and on the counter there was what looked like a Torani Syrup bottle next to the Splenda. I thought it was liquid sugar (like simple syrup) and almost squirted it in my mug before reading the front and seeing it was actually hand sanitizer. Rationally I know I read the front and stopped myself. I remember thinking I shouldn’t even drink the coffee because I knew I would have these thoughts that I had contaminated it but I forced myself to drink it as a form of exposure therapy.

But my brain is now telling me, what if I did squirt it in my coffee and I don’t remember and now I’ve poisoned my baby. I just cannot seem to move on from this.

I don't qualify for the injectables and can't afford them out of pocket. What I was given was Metformin which I rolled my eyes at. Seeing however as I had struck gold by being given an appointment with the Endocrinologist I said I would do everything by the book and take it. 

I've been taking 500mg after my first meal of the day. For the first week I would have to make a dash for the bathroom but no faster than I would after my morning coffee. I think that has settled down for the most part

It's been a few weeks now and the food noise has mostly gone. I had a cake in the house for a WEEK!!! Each day I would take a slice and put the rest back. In the before times I would eat it all in one day. I wouldn't be able to stop thinking about it until it was gone. I'd be up in the middle of the night eating dry crackers etc. I have no desire. 
When I'm hungry and I feel....hungry instead of what I used to be like. A frenzied shark in a school of fish or an addict with a gnawing, dizzying need.

My diet has been 1500 calories with 80g of protein. I'm trying to bring the protein up slowly. That being said I lived the 120g a day protein life before and it's truly joyless 🤢

I've actually abandoned my breakfast beside me to type this as I'm too full to finish. 

I'm curious has anyone else any positive Metformin stories?

I've also started seed cycling and have raw carrot every day. If it does nothing it does nothing but at the very least it's adding something to my gut biome.

About me:

Mostly sabi nila, I don't look 26. I look like 20-24 yrs old. Lagi din napag hinalaan na studyante. (Well studyante pnmn ako) I'm still studying because nagshift ng course, but I have a part-time job (WFH).

I'm a Christian guy & naging part ng KBS (Mostly, sinasabi nila sakin is mabait, and inosente, but they don't know my true nature. I mean tao lang po tayo, we need sexual desire right? hahaha)

* 5'7
* Maputi, Neat, and Mabango
* Cute (Not sure, pero sabi daw nila)
* Naka salamin & braces
* Average Body (Nag gym dati, pero na stop because busy sa school, other activity sa labas and + work pa)
* Lowkey lang, I'm not a social media person (But we can video call, If you want to see my face)
* Introvert, coffee lover, & chill guy
* I love Games, Movies, Anime, Manga, and Music
* Not interested sending nudes, in messenger or other apps (Mahirap napo, baka kumalat, kaya ingat po tau lahat)

Let's get straight to the point:

I'm only looking for one partner. I don't like third parties and makikipag talik kahit kanino. One is enough for me. I'm also very open, if may mga fantasies or fetishes ka na gusto mo itry, sabihin mo lang po sa akin, and we can talk about it. Gusto kodin nmn mag explore and magtry to gain experience. Malay mo ung mga fantasies or fetish mo, magustuhan kodin. As long as makipag communicate ka lang. If di ka na satisfied, wag kana mahiya, just tell me, and we will do another round, until I ma satisfied kita. (For me, that's the point ng meetup, to satisfied our sexual needs dba?)

I'm also respectful po. If you're not interested to me, or nakahanap kana ng mas better ka FUBU, just let me know, and we can end it. Ganun lang po ka simple. :)

So ayun lang po, I'm looking for a FUBU (Long-term sana), we can chat and share din nmn about life. We can also help each other, If gusto mo din ng kalandian G lang ako.

Note: Respectfully po, Not interested with a Man (Gay) & Trans

This episode was the part where Dan and this professor at Constance had a rumor. The first time I saw the professor and Dan having a conversation, I already smelled something fishy. I was so mad at Dan always hanging out with this professor outside school LIKE DUDE??? He’s smart but doesn’t know about basic knowledge outside school? I was also mad at him when he comforted her at the coffee shop (Serena did an amazing job capturing that moment btw) like, why would he do that? He has a girlfriend and he don’t even talk to Serena that much because he’s still upset about her not accepting Yale but hanging out and comforting a freaking teacher? I was SO satisfied when Serena broke up with him. 

 Kinda felt bad to the teacher because I gave her the benefit of the doubt but my last straw was Dan, going to that teacher’s apartment and having sex with her, hours after breaking up with Serena.

After the figures of the squad disappeared, Muranaga leaned back on his desk. ""Whelp, it's gonna be a fun night. We're gonna kick back and relax for a bit, catch some sleep and then get the coffee going for the team tonight."" He reached up above his bunk and started pulling things down – a large carafe in the shape of an hourglass, several small tablets, and a container labeled ""Dread Pirate Roberts Coffee"" with a Terran skull on top of two crossed bones. Below in smaller print ""A better coffee is simply inconceivable!"" - below that in even smaller print was a list of warnings. There were a lot of warnings. The lid was opened and Gryzzk felt overwhelmed by the intensity of whatever was in there, and highly concerned for Muranagas' well-being.

Finally Gryzzk spoke up. ""er, what precisely is that?""

""Coffee. Plant that grows, produces caffeine. Wouldn't recommend it for you though – at least not until you've seen the doc and had a little screening.""

""Is it bad for you?""

""Can be. For Terrans it just elevates the heart rate, makes you more alert, all that. Which we're going to need tonight. We're on boarding party duty for about 6 hours. There'll be a quick chow break about 3 hours in for everyone – but right now we're just getting ready for tonight."" Muranaga looked over the setup and nodded before taking several gallons of water from the sink and setting them on his desk.

There was a nod. ""Ah. We would inhale herbs that had been crushed for energy if we needed it.""

Muranaga shrugged. ""Takes all kinds, I guess. Hopefully you won't need it tonight. For now though...we're on a mandatory rest. Hit the rack, try to settle, and we're waking up in about 7 hours."" After that he took his own advice, laying down, taking several deep breaths, and then Muranaga began a soft regular breathing pattern.

Gryzzk recognized the pattern as sleeping. Terrans. How they were able to do such things was amazing. for his own part, he was not at ease, with his thoughts clamoring to be heard all at once. At the same time. He tried focusing on an image of his wife, but the initial ease was broken by her berating him for failure, leaving her to care for their lord. As much as he couldn't be in two places once, that wasn't exactly an excuse. His lord needed him, his wife needed him, and at the same time his wife and lord needed him to be here. The thoughts kept rolling through his mind before finally he sat up to take account of his things to confirm that all was orderly.

Clanfur was present, reminding him of home. After a moment he tucked it into a pocket. Clothes were in place waiting for when he was no longer on duty. Spare translator unit was in place. The emergency beacon looked different somehow. It was normally on Lord A'kifabs' personage as part of his traveling attire. That his lord had given it to him was a deep sign of his lords' care, and yet somehow there was something of it that seemed off. Gryzzk puzzled over this before setting it aside and going through the rest of his items with care. Finally he completed his inventory, and returning to the clanfur and taking deep breaths. Wherever he was, the fur was with him – and the fur was the clan. It set his mind at ease. At least long enough for his eyes to close and then have himself shaken awake by Muranaga, who was already fully dressed in his combat armor.

""Shake a leg, Gryzzk. We got a job to do, observer."" From Gryzzks' perspective, Muranaga looked like some manner of armored titan, ready and able to dispense the justice of the gods themselves should the situation call for it – despite Muranaga only being a little taller than normal.

Gryzzk swung his feet out of bed, testing the gravity again before standing fully and getting dressed slowly in the armor he'd been given. The room smelled odd, as if something fragrantly bitter had been spilled. Muranaga helped with securing a few of the fittings that weren't where he would have expected them to be. Part of him was amazed that they were able to modify the helmet cleanly to fit his head. Overall, it was comfortable and not at the same time – the displays that slowly lit up showing the time, conditions outside the armor, armor condition, and squad position were awkward to see at first. It did make sense for soldier. Which brought a question to mind.

""Lieutenant Muranaga – I am an observer, is all of this truly necessary?""

There was a nod in reply. ""Yep. For your safety and ours. Don't worry. Ninety-nine times out of hundred it's just a six hour bull session with crappy midnight rations and bad coffee. Speaking of which..."" Muranaga lifted a large jug that looked like some sort of crockery – it appeared to be the source of whatever Gryzzk was smelling.

Gryzzk lifted his helmet face-shield and sniffed. And it was definitely the source. On the positive side, Gryzzk seemed to have his fatigue lifted from him after 3 breaths of it. He tugged his face shield down and the hud lit up, though the time read 2155 in yellow. Muranaga touched the control to open the door, and the stepped out into the half-lit hallway to see the rest of the squad – the only differences were height, rank insignia, their nameplate, and their weapons load-out. For the first time Gryzzk was able to see a human squad in combat readiness. Despite the portrayals in popular dramas, in the flesh they seemed both less and more than what the writers of such dramas described. Muranaga was frightening enough. Gryzzk multiplied that by the other four in the squad and stopped wondering why Terrans were forbidden from declaring war or having war declared on them.

Muranaga set the jug down, and spoke softly, his voice coming in clearly through an audio speaker in the helmet. ""Squad, ten-hut."" He looked at all of them casually. ""Sergeant, squad ready for inspection?""

""Squad is ready, sir."" Roberts' name pulsed blue as he spoke.

Muranaga nodded. ""Comm check. Squad sound off.""

At his command each of the spoke their name in turn, and all seemed in order, as Muranaga nodded. ""Observer Gryzzk, comm check. You got a name?""

Gryzzk blinked in surprise. ""Er, I do. Gryzzk.""

""Good enough for an observer."" There was light amusement in his voice. ""Sergeant, get 'em moving.""

The squad made their way to the rear of the ship, where an almost inaudible hum greeted them. There was a brief moment of formality as the watch was officially exchanged, and then Muranaga got the jug in place on a shelf that appeared to have been built for the purpose. After locking it in, Muranaga flipped his visor up, and the rest of the squad did the same.

""Alright. Welcome to home for the next six hours, coffee's courtesy of the Dread Pirate Roberts, latrine hasn't moved. Who other than Reilly's got a joke?""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Officer country, Muranagas quarters*

Despite the fact that the halls were dark and empty, the two officers walked softly as they overrode the lock and walked in, smirking at the scent of the coffee.

""Glad at least one other officer's got their head straight. Twenty creds says if we tossed Muranagas' bunk half his storage would be his squads' favorite nibbles from home and a couple-four pints of liquor in a false bottom."" Ericsson seemed to faintly approve.

""Why do you think the old man said to toss Gryzzks' stuff and not the whole room?"" Sparked grinned easily, taking footage so they could put everything back as they found it. ""A ventbug can't fart in this place without the Major knowing. Anyway. Looks pretty tame for the most part. No fakery in the luggage itself, inside we got clothes, sundries, and...what do we have here. A locator beacon."" Sparks eyed it. ""Looks like one of the old Crybaby-5 models, but this casing's a little off."" After a few moments of scanning to make certain there was no switch associated with the casing, Sparks selected a tool and tapped the casing a few times before prying a section off. ""I spy with my little eye, a docu-disk."" The casing was replaced and the device scanned again. ""Captain, we've got a problem. This crybaby's gonna nap for about another hour, and then it's gonna go off.""

Ericsson tapped his rank once. ""Major, Captain Ericsson, urgent - emergency locator beacon had a docu-disk hidden, and the beacon's primed to go live in an hour. Orders?""

There was only silence in reply. Long enough that Ericsson coughed. ""Comm check; Major?""

A growl was the Captains' reply. ""Stand by, Captain.""

Sparks checked against the video to verify before putting everything back as he found it. Which was not nearly as easy as it seemed, as Gryzzk had a very odd way of packing. Finally the comm came alive again.

""Captain, return those quarters to their original condition, bring the docudisk. Might be it's just some Vilantian adult entertainment.""

""And the beacon?""

""Leave it. Someone set a trap for us, and I'd like to know who - that way Legal can send the bill to the right estate. This also means Sparks that you've got an hour to find out what's on that docu-disk.""

Sparks nodded, moving at a double-time to his electronic nest.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Aft docking hatch*

The squad was, for lack of a better word, bored. Muranaga seemed content to let them be bored and sip coffee, occasionally sipping coffee in between grumbling. For his part, Gryzzk seemed fascinated by the attitude. Something like this it felt important, even at such a late hour, and yet they were treating it as an inconvenience tempered only by the fact that they were receiving extra energy once their duties were completed. It certainly didn't mesh well with the Clan-Way, where even being noticed by the lords and Great Lords was the greatest privilege. Gryzzk was certainly aware of his position, and knew that it was his greatest fortune to be where he was. While there may have been some talk among the other servants, it was only talk. Everyone knew their place and kept to it, as even in peaceful times punishments were severe - and these were not peaceful times for Vilantia.

""Incoming message."" Gryzzks' faceshield slapped down a few moments after the electronic warning, and the face of the Major appeared on his visor. All of Gryzzks' eyes blinked looking at him, and he stammered a bit before speaking. ""Hello, Major.""

The Major seemed apologetic as he spoke. ""I'm sorry to interrupt like this - I know you're still adjusting to the ship, but I've just received a priority warning from my counterparts in Alpha and Charlie companies about a Vilantian group called the Hurtian Unification League. Something about accepting the Hurdop as partners and integrating the Clan Way to their species. Would you happen to have any insight into that?""

Gryzzk furrowed his brow for what seemed an eternity. ""I believe my Lord spoke with one of them once at a gathering of all the nearby lords and our Great Lord. Lord A'kifab seemed highly disappointed afterward. He commented..."" Gryzzk paused for the exact words ""...that the League would have us submit to their ways and be pirates and brigands.""

There was a silence as the Major seemed to take it in. ""Rogue faction. I think I understand. Thank you for your time."" The visor rose back enough to see the visors of all the squad members also going back up.

Gryzzk blinked. ""What. What happened?""

Muranaga spoke for the group. ""Well, not to put to fine a point on it, but we are a recon squad, and we've been doing our job. Just from what you've told us, your planet's in a bad situation. There's generally some rationing in any war as resources are diverted, but your planet - it's as severe as I've seen lately and usually when that happens, losing's a guarantee. But the Vilantians ain't quitting. At least on the surface. That said, you can't keep this up forever. Unless there's some drastic change, Vilantia's got a year, maybe three. Neither of you are important enough to the Collective for there to be any fuss, but someone on Vilantia wants to change the game."" Gryzzk sensed that all had not been told, and he was right as Muranaga continued.

""We just had our quarters inspected, and Sparks found a locator beacon. Had a compartment in it with a docudisk, laid out the whole plan - said you'd skimmed money, arranged for the Throne-Heir to be kidnapped and taken to Teegarden in order to finagle more money from your lord and his fellows, knowing that you'd be the observer and start a war between the Terrans and the Hurdop. According to the doc, you wanted Terrans to fight the Hurdop while the Collective discussed things in committee and eventually would have decided the Hurdop were the aggressors on account of this was a legal contract. Thus giving the folks at home their Throne-Heir, a reason to fight, and breathing space to fight back long enough for the Collective to drop a full sanction on the Hurdop. After that, the Hurdop worlds would be wiped from nav maps, and any ships with Hurdop registry would be shoot on sight. Unless they submitted to the full authority of a Collective member, which Vilantia is. And then it ended with sworn statements from you and your wife that Lord A'kifab didn't know any of this, and that per the Clan-Way he should be absolved of your crimes. Convenient, yeah?""

Gryzzk blinked. Blinked again. ""But kidnapping the Throne-heir. Such a violation would mean terrible things. My wife, our children...we would be exiled, lost to twilight...better to have been born without life..."" He sat heavily, each word a sledgehammer to his heart. Gryzzk sat, the enormity of everything causing tears to rise to his eyes and fall unnoticed to his muzzle and chin. ""We will be exiled. Why? Who would this...to us?""

Muranaga spread his hands. ""You did say Lord A'kifab gave you the locator beacon.""

Gryzzk nodded. ""Yes. I...excuse me."" He went to the latrine and slammed the door shut, managing to get his helmet off before vomiting into the bowl. And after that, more tears came at the realizations that his friend since birth, his lord, the one who had chosen his mate so well that they were one scent in two bodies was the creator of all of this.

The squad was waiting for him when he exited, Muranaga with his visor down and the rest of the squad with their helmets off. Reilly and Edwards engulfed him with an embrace, while Roberts and Laroy waited. The smells were mixed and powerful, with the coffee underpinning a mix of sorrow and anger.

Once the two had stopped hugging him, he felt somehow better. Laroy had taken off his helmet and pulled a small satchel from around his neck and put it around Gryzzks'.

""Dat right there a *gris-gris* bag from my Grandmama Thibedeaux. She say it bring me good luck in the stars. You need good luck more than me, *ami*."" Laroy then punched Gryzzks' shoulder gently and stepped aside, waiting for Roberts to say something. Which he did.

""Ain't a war fought that's been won by tears. Right now Gryzzk you're feeling some kinda way and I can appreciate that. But right now, LT's on the comms and that means there's a job to do coming up on us fast. And right now, you're are gonna need every scrap of who you are to kick through. Not what anybody else thinks you are. What \*you\* are. This squad'll do everything it can to keep you alive, but you're gonna have to do your share as well. Right now, we need you, and your family's gonna need you in the days coming. Understand?""

Gryzzk nodded, drawing strength from this latest in the latest turn. It seemed that the Terran Clan-Way was markedly different. The Lords' word would have been sufficient, and Gryzzks' family would have been provided the barest essentials for modesty's sake before being driven off the land with fire.

Muranagas' visor came up. ""Folks, longscan shows one unknown vessel on a direct vector for us. We're the welcome wagon in about 20 minutes. Stretch, hit the latrine, then lock and load. Sergeant, make sure everyone’s sealed in. Comm check in five, Weapons check in 10."" And with that his visor snapped down again.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

*Bridge*

""Lieutenant, status report."" The Majors voice was calm and collected. For the moment.

Muranagas' voice came over the comm. ""Well sir, Gryzzk cried and then barfed. Could be worse.""

""Keep 'em ready, we got 10 minutes before this incoming ship hits comms range. We're gonna talk, but I doubt they're willing to listen. When that happens, do your job. Major Williams out.""

The Major silenced the comm, looking over the bridge crew. ""Alright, you know what to do, but I'mma say it any just in case. Comms, make sure the Standard Warning is prepped to send, advise we're not firing first but we will fire last. Tactical, after standard warning get a lock on their drive core. Make sure they know we can make their day a bad one. Sound General Quarters.""

The ship continued on its' course, with the unknown ship coming to intercept. In contrast to the sleek lines and arrowed shape of the Terran vessel, their counterpart appeared to be cobbled together with happy thoughts and duct tape. Weapons arrays, an offset drive section, and multiple hull patches spoke of a ship that didn't have a proper repair facility. Or an improper one. But it was flying and it was most definitely armed and that made it an item worthy of consideration.

""Major, this thing's got two ident squawks on it. Could be a split-ship."" The tactical officer looked concerned at the possibility of an honest brawl becoming a two-on-one.

""Confirm that – launch a drone and see if you can give me a ping from their sensors. Let's see if we can give them a ghost to chase."" The Major turned slightly. ""Once we've got a lock on what they're using, code up a ghost for Cereal Killer and launch.""

The next few minutes were quiet until the tactical station called out. ""Major, they're using a sensor suite cobbled from at least four different ship lines. It's gonna be a minute until we can get a solution.""

""You've got one minute Tack. Make it count. Conn, all stop - shut down everything not life support, let's see if these boys'll give chase.""

Fifty-eight seconds later the tactical officer punched a button and a new dot appeared. ""Cereal Killer is away.""

""And with two seconds to spare. You spoil me Tack.""

Everyone on the bridge had their eyes glued to the display showing the relative position of their sensor-duplicate and the ship pursuing them. Everyone breathed a little easier when the pursuer took the bait and began chasing the duplicate at high speed.

The Major pointed a finger. ""Bring us back to normal silent, lay in a pursuit course. Stay in their drive shadow and get the cold-weld docking ring ready. Once we've made contact, we'll decide how tight the leash needs to be for the aft boarding party.""

Sparky spoke up after a few minutes of pursuit. ""We're being hailed. Audio only.""

There was a nod from the Major, and a voice that sounded a bit like a Vilantian was heard. ""Terran invader - this is the Hurdop warship *Glorious Purpose*. We have a targeting solution on your drive core. Cut your engines and exit the system. Any deviation from these orders will be seen as an act of war.""

The Major didn't immediately reply, sending a typed query for when they would be ready to board. Satisfied with the reply, he turned his attention to the communicator. ""*Glorious Purpose*, this is the Terran Mercenary ship *Voided Warranty*. We are on a legal contract - naturally I can't share the details, but the contract is valid and has been filed under standard seal. Non critical details will be made available two standard weeks after completion. If fired upon, we are authorized to take any and all measures to defend ourselves."" There was a small green light on the Majors' screen, signaling that they'd matched docking bays and were ready to board at his nod.

There was a growl from the speakers. ""There will be no two weeks, you and your ship will die now."" There was a blip to indicate the comms had been cut and a pair of missiles ejected from the *Glorious Purpose*, streaking toward the decoy.

The Major nodded. ""That counts according to Legal."" He tapped a control. ""Aft boarding party, good hunting.""",12,1728313710.0,HFY,4,0.93,False

so a month passes and we get coffee, and at the end he asks me to take the clothing I BOUGHT FOR HIM and his journal from the day we broke up to the day we met up. in the heat of the moment i agreed. but even before i opened it at home, i thought that it was shitty of him to do. I don't need to know your grief, how could you ask me to take this? are you guilting me? how can you say we should be friends and give such an item to me. 

the clothing hurts as well. I bought him flannels because i knew he would look nice in them, and he did. There was also a nice dress shirt for an interview, i got him this for our first christmas together. getting these back, he said ""*They're too close to you, but i want them back one day. I just can't have them right now*"" 

I fully intend on seeing him again one day, even after this, but god it made things shitty. He's being shitty to me and i cant tell how aware he is of this. Although he kept my other gifts to him, getting the flannels sucked.

But the journals? Only ex lovers or erotic rivals give each other a book of letters that are full of such pain and emotion. It feels like his last ditch effort to connect with me, and a little manipulative. bleh",1,1728313589.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

### Training
I started this year as bad as I have ever felt, physically, outside of being injured. I wasn't running much, eating poorly, not sleeping, and was stressed. Babies will do that to you, I suppose. But we found a deal at Sam's Club on an exercise bike that my wife wanted to get, and then a great deal on a treadmill popped up too, and having the low barrier of those in our garage really helped us get back on track. A buddy of mine wanted to do some races together, the only one of which we actually did was a relay marathon, but that encouragement also helped me put more mileage in over the spring. I lost some momentum over the summer with a ridiculous work schedule, but have felt pretty good since September or so.

My big problem was that I wasn't getting the distance back. I had some fast runs, I had some great runs, but I never had any real *long* runs. I signed up for this race two weeks ago, mostly because it went literally through my backyard and it seemed too convenient not to do it. But I hadn't run over 10 miles in a few years, so I was genuinely concerned about a half.

On Tuesday, I bought new shoes out of necessity. I ended up with some Saucony Kinvaras, which are an actual dream. So light, but it feels so cushioned. I had a frustrating work call on my way back from the running store, so I stopped in a neighborhood and started running. I ended up doing 10.25 in a very quick pace, and felt great after, which gave me a lot of confidence.

### Pre-race
Since sleep is a rare commodity in our house right now, I set my alarm and went to bed on the couch, hoping I could get up early and sneak out without waking my wife or kids. Sadly, the baby cried basically all night long and no one got much sleep. I had set out my standard cereal, but more than usual (muesli, bran flake, almonds, various seeds), put a coffee in the microwave, and slept in my racing clothes so I could make the morning go as fast as possible. So at least that went in my favor.

Parking downtown is free on Saturdays, and I work right by the park where the race began and ended, so it was low-stress getting in. I picked up my bib and did some light dynamic stretching while trying sort out my running playlist. I had accidentally put in a podcast that I already listened to (Welcome to Night Vale) and was trying to remove it, but my watch only syncs music on WiFi, so I was stuck with it. So I turned it on before the race to get it out of the way, listening to Cecil talk about the town for a second time that week.

As we lined up, I tried to find out who was running at what pace. I knew the beginning of the route was a fairly narrow path, so I wanted to be able to spread out early. Looking at past years, there were usually a handful of sub-90s, with one or two sub-80, and I figured I could keep up with them just for the first mile to get a good space between folks. But no one seemed very committal about pacing, so I ended up right in the front. 

### Race
When the race started, one guy went out *hard.* Like, comically hard. He was sprinting, but with, shall we say, interesting form. After half a mile, I caught up to him and he seemed gassed already. And that, shockingly, left me in first, a position did not anticipate. I figured others must be right behind me, and would soon pass, but as we started nearing the second mile I realized that if anyone was planning to run a sub 80 they'd be well ahead by now. And, if anyone was planning to run sub 85, they would need to be ahead of my pace as well. 

The first turn is about 5k into the race, at which point I felt like I was running completely alone. I wondered if there was something wrong, like I had missed something major, but the guy at the turn just cheered me on. That episode of Night Vale came on for a THIRD time, so I was graced with Cecil Baldwin yet again. I looped around a small lake where my family often plays, then went up into the neighborhood across from my own. I knew this was a deceptively large hill, with the first rise going for .6 miles and a second hill for .4 after, so again I expected someone to pass me there. But I kept enough momentum to keep my pace decent, and managed to regain the speed quickly as we passed into my actual neighborhood.

I live behind a nature preserve with a beautiful paved trail separating my backyard from the wildnerness, which is where we ran. [I had made some fun chalk signs](https://imgur.com/a/683VBlg) with my older kid the day before, included a big spider on a web telling people to not take the path into the road but to continue on the path to the right (later, my wife told me she heard several runners missed the chalk and the race had failed to put a sign there, the only oversight on the course, so they weren't happy). Since my yard was right there, I stashed a squeeze bottle of salted gatorade on a post to grab, and my family was out with noise makers and signs. They, and I, were shocked that I was in first at that point, since we were at the halfway point. I threw the bottle in my neighbor's yard and tried to get some speed, as I knew this section super intimately and wanted to maximize the downhill.

Going through the neighborhood was a little sad, as no one was out supporting. Plus, it was hilly. But I got back to the main road and prepped to turn, only to be waylaid by a fire truck. It only added a few steps to around them, but I had to basically direct traffic for myself as the guy in the intersection didn't know what to do. Then I hit the 'viking ship,' which is a run I've been doing where I run down a steep hill and up the equally steep backside, then turn around and do it all again and again. I made it across the valley and turned back to the path back to the start for the final 5k, still expecting someone to pass me.

When I go to mile 10, and the straight path back (with lots of morning runners and the 10k racers), I wanted to win. But the second I started to think 'I'm gonna do this!' I also started thinking, 'but what if someone passes you right at the end? Won't that hurt so much worse? You should slow down and let someone pass now so you don't feel so bad at the end.' What a dumb, intrusive thought! Not being accustomed to winning anything, this was a real mind trip for me.

For the last three miles, I fought that weird thought, plus my toes started to feel like I was losing a toenail, plus my right hamstring started to feel a little crampy, but I didn't want to waste this opportunity to finally win a real race. I didn't have the energy to really push any pace for the last two miles, but I was able to coast in with a reasonably strong finish. I nearly collapsed at the line, but overall felt pretty dang great!  

### Post-race
This was a smaller race to begin with, and the group hosting it was pretty minimal and chill. There was some music, a massage table (a true godsend for that right hammy), and lots of relaxed cheering. Had a banana and a biscuit, plus some gatorade while I waited around to make sure I didn't miss being honored; I've placed in my age group before, but never in the overall, and finally headed home.

Very silly choice, but I offered to camp with my toddler in the backyard that night, so I got no sleep for the second straight night. Sunday is a big work day (I'm a minister), so this weekend was *a lot.* Plus, this morning, a staff member publcially resigned without informing us, so I'm taking some much needed time to be distracted and ignore reality for a little bit (sorry for the length...).

I think I'll lose two toenails, but otherwise no big issues. Totally worth it.

I'm getting in the dating scene for the first time. I only had a 6 year long relationship, but in that case we were already friends so I don't really know how dating works.

I have to give you some context before my question starts making sense.
I met a girl, 29f, who works in the coffee shop in front of my office. After chatting every once in a while for a few weeks, one time knowing that I was soon going to be away for a whole month I asked her if she wanted to keep in touch. She happily accepted so I gave her my number and my Instagram tag. For the remaining week we texted a bit (only) on instagram, then asked her to go to a local concert/festival. She told me she was already going with a friend, but she was happy to meet up there. Sadly I had to cancel, and when I told her she also said she wasn't going, because her boyfriend (which I didn't know about until then) broke up with her.

Considering the situation I slightly pressed the brakes of my interest towards her, for her sake, but still kept in touch with her, both in and out (via text) of the coffee shop. So we spent the next 2 months talking and chatting every once in a while, about everything, even pretty personal stuff. She then texted me on WhatsApp, that means she kept my number for like a month and a half. She seemed to be getting over the past relationship pretty quickly (it lasted only a few months to be fair) and she seemed very happy. One day I texted her asking if she wanted to go out sometime, and she was happy to do so. So one afternoon we hung out for 2 hours, ate a lot of ice-cream and talked a lot. It might not seem like much time but she had a very busy day and was exhausted. Also, I specifically asked her to see each other in the afternoon because I wanted to take it easy.

Here is the thing, I'm feeling like she thought of it only as a friendly hang out. I mean, I thought I was pretty obvious with my intentions, also telling her that I would have preferred asking her out in person instead of via text but I didn't want to bother her at work. Also, I thought I was obvious even 2 months ago, when I gave her my number and asked her to go to the concert. At least this time she alluded a few times to go out again.

By the way, considering I never really went out on dates, is it normal to nonchalantly talk in passing about past exes? Not directly about them, but about situations in which they were linked in some way. Maybe it’s me, but I really do not like to talk about my ex and stuff, even in passing, especially when I’m out with someone, even friends, so I don't know what is the norm. 

I like her a lot. I thought it was obvious, but it might not be enough. I don't know how dating works so I don't know what to do. Was that little hang out even a date? Also, she is really cool, and I would still really be interested to stay friends if it doesn't work out, so I am afraid to mess things up between us.

I developed PT in beginning if July, panicked obviously, went to the doctors, the found what is referred to as a ""bruit"" on my neck. Basically it's the sound of turbulent blood flow which travelled up my head to my ear. They kind of indicated that it's commonly associated with stenosis and scheduled a CT scan about a month later. I had some really rough weeks after that, basically felt that it would never go away, that I might have to go through some stenting, be in blood thinners for the rest of my life and all these things that come up online.

But, I also stumbled upon two specific things that caught my interest.. 

One of them being ""dissection"", which I understand is a sort of separation of the arterial walls, potentially causing stroke, and being the most common cause for stroke in people under the age of 50. It seemed these could be caused by strenuous activities, and I had actually been doing a 10K running program, basically pushing myself to do the 10K before schedule just a day or two before the onset of the PT. I found this a little suspicious, so I looked into it more and I found another person on this sub actually that had developed a dissection without any other symptoms than the PT by lifting something heavy. I told my doctor but they basically said ""it comes with a lot of pain, so it's not it"", but it when looking into it, it doesn't always do that.

  
The other thing that I also found was iron deficiency, and being a vegetarian I couldn't rule out that when I look at my diet. Especially as liked to drink a lot of coffee which also inhibits the uptake of iron. Again, the doctors said ""your hemoglobin is fine, you're not deficient"", but looking into it further it seems that one needs to check ferritin specifically and that the ""normal range"" is so huge that just because you fall within the range doesn't mean it's good, if that makes sense. I turned out to be in the very low end of the range. So, I started taking iron supplements. It seems not uncommon as a symptom for iron deficiency, but I am not entirely sure that the specific type of sound I have is associated with that. 

After a week or two I started noticing that the PT became weaker and weaker, and finally I realized I hadn't heard it for a whole day, and then basically it hasn't come back. Then the CT scan also came back clean.

I still struggle to believe it, but I haven't heard it for two months now or thereabouts.

So, all I know is that there was a turbulence that caused a sound, this was verified, it has since gone away and they didn't see anything on the scan. The downside is that it means I don't know what it was that caused it. But, I suspect it could have been iron deficiency or a small dissection that healed on it's own.

Obviously, these are all just thought that carry no medical value whatsoever, but the fact remains that I developed PT, it was objective verified by a doctor, and it went away without a real explanation.

So, it can definitely happen.

I was thinking stuff like coffee shops, bars, restaurants, parks, nature trails, general activities like gaming spots or I don’t know mini golf, theaters, etc. anything to get people out of a constant thought process of relief and rebuild, if only for a moment.

Before we moved in they ""lost"" our deposit. In UK, money moves as instant transfers - it's seconds, money doesn't go missing. Once we provided the details they found it and were apologetic but that was first red flag but sometimes people mess up so we let it go.

We mostly roast coffee, they knew this and it's literally in the email address we used to them. Our first time roasting we did some air flow tests, piped the smoke outside and stuff but the next morning we had an email saying it must stop with a hyperbolic email as if we lit a fire in the middle of the unit and start cooking on an open flame. That took a month to sort out and I only roasted properly at the unit first time yesterday.

We are 90% online, but there's issues with the neighbours too closing the gates to let dogs roam in the car park or an entitlement to all the space which stops proper access to our unit so if we did start to aim to attract walk in customers we've got potential difficult conversations to have.

We're a husband & wife team and we've been doing this over 10 years, we're small but know what we are doing and getting along, the ""ban"" costs us £thousands but landlords hardly seemed to care or have any urgency about it, the rep we deal with hides behind ""the directors"" and only when I ask to speak to them something gets done. Their names have never been offered. Landlords are a proper limited company, not just random people with a property.

This is our 3rd premises in the time we've been in business and our previous commercial landlords have been great, it was only residential landlords making us homeless forced a city move.

On one hand the unit is cheap, good location, and ticks many boxes and it's just the landlord which we could excuse since everything else is good and just acquiesce to all landlords are bastards and we put up with it. This is the cheapest and easiest option.

On the other hand we've only signed a 1 year lease, we have to give 3 months notice so come May 2025 we could be in moving out stage for August. This would require more cash and make me much busier but I could spend my time from now to make sure we get it right and I wouldn't be spending any money on the current unit to improve it for shitty landlords.

I planned to pay for it, but at the end of the meal my date just grabbed the bill and paid. I guess I was taken off guard because I kind of just said “thank you” instead of insisting on grabbing my half. Once it was paid I felt it would be weird to offer to transfer him, so I just said thank you for dinner again when we parted ways. I feel terrible that he paid for me to waste food, and am wondering if this is the reason he never asked me on a second. Like I’ve said I’ve known him for awhile, and in that time have offered to buy coffees etc so I hope he knows I’m not using him for money.

1fy9apy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CureAnxiety/comments/1fy9apy/effective_natural_methods_for_treating_panic/,Effective Natural Methods for Treating Panic Attacks - You don't need to futilely try to overcome panic attacks by thinking and controlling your breathing.,"Panic attacks are a manifestation of anxiety disorders and also indicate that anxiety disorders are getting worse. If generalized anxiety disorder is not treated promptly, it can likely develop into panic disorder.

If you are suffering from panic attacks, I completely understand, as I have had the same experience. Four years ago, I experienced 3 to 4 severe panic attacks daily. However, I am now fully recovered. Here, I am willing to share my recovery experience，hoping that everyone can overcome the distress of panic disorder.

The causes of panic attacks are not entirely clear at present. Biologically, scientists have discovered several theories that may explain panic disorder:

1，**Amygdala and Hippocampus:** These brain regions are closely related to emotional regulation and stress responses. In panic disorder patients, the amygdala and hippocampus show increased sensitivity to fear stimuli, and their volume may increase or decrease. When the amygdala becomes excited, nerve signals are transmitted through the autonomic nervous system to parts connected to the internal organs and trunk, causing rapid heartbeat and difficulty breathing.

**2，HPA Axis:** The HPA axis is also called the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. It is an important endocrine system in our body that regulates the body's physiological response to stress. The HPA axis gets activated during conflict and stress. Excessive stimulation can lead to dysregulation of the HPA axis stress response, triggering panic symptoms.

**3，Neurofunctional Imbalance:** Neurological dysfunction, resulting in a lack or excess of the serotonin system, causes individuals to overreact to certain potential threats, which in turn causes symptoms of autonomic nervous system disorders.

4. Panic patients are very sensitive to anxiety-inducing substances, including caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and sugar.

5. Individuals with panic disorder may have a genetic predisposition.

These factors lead to dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system connected to the internal organs, causing symptoms similar to heart disease and stroke, although physical examinations show no substantial lesions. However, this does not mean there are no issues in the body.

Currently, we do not have the technology to detect real-time damage to brain neurons and the autonomic nervous system. Nevertheless, in animal experiments, abnormalities in the brains of some anxious animals can be found through dissection and microscopic observation. Therefore, even if the physical examination does not find abnormalities, it cannot rule out abnormalities in the brain and nervous system related to anxiety.

Some people think that panic attacks are just psychological problems, but those who have really experienced it will know that no matter how hard you try to overcome them through thinking, it is futile.

Panic attacks need to be addressed by calming and balancing the autonomic nervous system while repairing the amygdala and hippocampus in the brain.

The following are effective ways to treat panic attacks:

1. **Stabilize the Nerv**es: When panic attacks occur frequently, the first step is to stabilize the nervous system. The quickest and most effective method is to take medication immediately to calm the nerves, such as Ativan. This is a prescription drug and you need to find a family doctor to prescribe it. Panic disorder can cause atrial fibrillation and excessive nervous tension, and long-term frequent attacks may cause damage to the body. Therefore, it is necessary to calm the nerves first to prevent excessive damage. These medications should only be used short-term, ideally not exceeding one month. When the brain and nervous system recover, you don't have to take it again.

**2, Comprehensive Examination:** During the first panic attack, get a full medical checkup to rule out other possible diseases. If other organic lesions are found during the examination, treat them as soon as possible.

**3, Avoid Trigger Substances:** Certain substances can trigger panic attacks, especially those with anxiety disorders are particularly sensitive to these substances. Please avoid coffee, tea, chocolate, nicotine-containing substances, alcohol, marijuana and sugar.

**4, Treat the Root Cause:** The most important thing is to treat the root cause of panic attacks, that is, to restore the normal function of the amygdala and hippocampus in the brain and restore the autonomic nervous system to normal.

* **Magnesium Supplements:** First, take magnesium supplements to improve brain function. Research shows that magnesium can improve anxiety in a short period.
* **Nutritional Supplements:** Provide substantial nutritional supplements needed by the brain to accelerate brain cell recovery, such as high-concentration fish oil, lecithin, and vitamin C.
* **Appropriate Exercise and Diet:** Proper exercise and diet are also crucial for brain recovery.",1,1728312103.0,CureAnxiety,0,1.0,False

One of the reasons I developed PairPoint is because of too many missed opportunities with people you might actually have a real chance with. We all know that spontaneous in-person connections happen every day—whether it’s at your local coffee shop, on the train to work, at the gym, at a party, or at events like business networking, fairs, football games, etc.—but often, no move is made, leading to missed opportunities. There are many reasons for not making an in-person approach: fear of rejection (which is completely normal for most of us), bad timing, or perhaps the other person is with friends and you don’t want to intrude. This is where PairPoint comes in handy—next time this happens, just open the app, allow discovery, and save your location. Later, relive your day by opening your location history to see who else saved it. The rest is up to you.  
All while having full control over your profile for both real-time and location history. You decide when to allow your profile to be discoverable, when to save your location, and how you want your profile to be seen by other users.  
There’s no liking or swiping, no matching based on interests and potential compatibilities, and no matching algorithms. With PairPoint, you are the algorithm.

We’ve worked hard and bootstrapped this ourselves, so your feedback is genuinely appreciated and will be very helpful. The app is currently available on the App Store in the UK and USA and can be downloaded here. For additional information, visit our website at https://pairpointapp.com.

..._<sits us down for breakfast>_... I had a small setback or disappointment this weekend. Someone seems to turn out not as supportive and understanding as I thought they would be. Mor judgemental than I had expected from them. And I get it, having one's own opinions, but I didn't expect them to sort of take it out on me. 

..._<takes sip of coffee to wash bite of bread away>_... While it's no fun, here is what has changed for me over the years in my reaction to something like this. ""People filter themselves out."" See? It's less about _me_ feeling the pain, loss, or disappointment -- although the ""this is not my idea of a fun life experience"" is still there, of course. It's more about that person, that friend, revealing themselves to be not the kind of person I need in my life. They filter themselves out. And for them, it's sad that their prescriptive opinions prevent them from having a full on supportive friendship.

..._<smiles>_...

And I don't know if this is a function of age or the work I've been doing on myself, but there is peace and ease. There isn't that almost anxious feeling of I need to keep this person in my life come what may. I have my own good life -- including the normal ups and downs -- and that doesn't change with this.

It's good to become more solid throughout the years. More at ease with being oneself.

I've recently moved into a roommate situation. The appliances except for a couple are old though functional and have likely been installed by the landlord. Including this Krups microwave. 

https://preview.redd.it/ganajyb9actd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f02c89d41d11d0bcb6a90af72011ce058c6d6f6

The only make and model number I was able to find is this one:

\[ Text Transcript:   
KRUPS  
Type 794   
220V\~ 50Hz   
2450MHz   
MW 1350W   
Registered Pattern  
Patent Pending  
Made In France  
Mod: 17M800PPOO (but the zeros could be o's and vice versa; the 8 might also be a b)   
4856462 \]

Now, I've tried searching for it online because I would like to have the manual to figure out which symbol on the lower dial corresponds to which number of watts. It's important because my microwavable heat plushy only takes a specific number of watts and I would want to not destroy it or set it on fire or something.

The issue is: I cannot find any manuals for Krups microwaves. To be exact, I cannot find proof of Krups even making microwaves, ever, by simply googling it. All it's giving me is small ovens and lots of coffee makers.   
I also tried Google Lens but while the pictures I found through that looked very similar, none of them were made by Krups. I also tried simply sifting through the databank of microwave manuals on like the biggest manual pdf websites and all, but no luck. The paper manual is also not in the basement or such.   
The last thing I just tried was different languages since this microwave was apparently produced in France. By using *Krups Microonde* I was able to find an *Italian* site, that led me to the name *maybe* being **Krups 794 micro-pro-compact (850W)**? But that doesn't match the watts given above, right? I don't really know how this works and whether the number on the back is also the number corresponding to the highest symbol / level.

Does anyone know which make and model this is, or, rather, does anyone have the manual, perhaps?  
Or, does anyone know how to figure out the watt amount for dials like this?

Basically if a coffee is advertised as $5, there must actually be a method for you to pay $5 for it. If they have a CC surcharge and that coffee is going to cost you $5.50, they need to accept cash so you can actually pay $5 for it. On the other hand, if they don’t accept cash, they need to abolish surcharges, or price the coffee at $5.50
If the population lets this slide, we are in for a lot more expenses in future, while transitioning to a cashless society, now is the time to stamp this out.

I'm working with an accounting and legal agency to help facilitate this transfer.  Right now we're expecting to sign on the 15th of this month (not sure yet if I'm to transfer the money on that exact date), with the actual physical handoff occurring on November 1st.  I'm wondering if it's normally to make the purchase in advance but not yet hand over the keys until 2 weeks later.  What happens to the revenue of the business in those 2 weeks between?  Should I hold on transferring funds until the handoff?  Or should I propose an initial deposit with the rest of the money sent after the handoff?  By the way, I'm in a developing country where these practices are nowhere near as formalized as in the US or Europe.

My business partner who is the restaurant expert (he owns and runs several restaurants and coffee shops) who usually handles this part is on a business trip overseas at the moment, while I'm waiting to hear back from him I was curious what the good folks here might have to say.

I work in Accounting in a small Office. There is one Keurig.   
  
One of my colleagues, will make coffee, and literally leave their cup on the little..tray thing. I moved the cup one day because it was sitting there and she was yappin across the hall for over 5 minutes. My coworker felt that this was disrespectful. I felt it was not alright to just harbor your mug when we have other employees that also want to make coffee. If you drink this shit you know exactly what I mean. It's part of the daily process. I am pretty cut and dry at work. I come in, I make my coffee, I work.   
  
""Good morning.""

Last week, it happened again. They just leave their mug underneath the thing. It's arrogant and inconsiderate, but I know as a man when something is petty as fuck and let me tell you what, this is petty. So I found a solution. I bought my own Keurig. Lil $80 guy from Amazon. It's perfect. I have it in my Office now. I never again have to worry about someone else's mug. Problem solved!

Well...it was not solved. My coworker finally mentioned, and I am paraphrasing, ""Did you really buy your own coffee-maker?"" I responded with ""I was getting irritated by not being able to make coffee when I come in because you leave your cup underneath the Keurig."" She did not enjoy this response whatsoever and got visibly upset.

Look, typing this out and re-reading this makes me not want to post it, but please my friends... if there is one coffee-maker that supplies the Oil to 10+ employees every day in a department, and you are leaving your cup underneath it and walking away talking about some Netflix series you watched over the weekend, you are in the wrong. Be considerate of others. Stop harboring over the coffee-maker please. One of you out here needs to read this and I have made it my duty to save one person on this Earth from the colleague who fucks around at the coffee-maker every single day.

(I also haven't traveled internationally, with connections, in a long time and all the lounge changes, etc etc).

  
I have Sky Club access via my Reserve Card. Next week I will be traveling from MSP-CDG < 2.5 hour layover > CDG-DEL. First leg is on Delta, second is on Air France but all booked through Delta. The flights are on different days due to the first being a redeye but it is all one reservation.

I know my way around the MSP lounges, no problem there. My question is the process of popping into a lounge in Paris. I doubt I'll have much time but it may still be nice to grab a coffee/snack/go to the bathroom/whatever even if for five minutes. I'll be traveling solo (work) so I'll be able to move fast.

  
Also, any general advice on navigating CDG would be useful as all I see is that it is a disaster. I flew through there a lot in my 20s-single-no-kids-whatever days (but still post 9/11) and it doesn't stand out as a bad experience but my standards were likely much lower and I was probably not connecting, just either arriving or leaving. I assume I won't have to go through customs since I'm not connecting to an EU country so it isn't my port-of-entry but Europe has some weird set-ups so I also assume nothing.

1fy8ql8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fy8ql8,OXO accidentally made a $35 Pulsar?,"The title is essentially the whole story, i dont own a Pulsar, but i just bought a hario switch, so i had. been looking into the pulsar and how it worked. i bought this OXO brewer to try for cold brew because it was cheap and people reviewed it well (also the carafe is adorable). as i was unboxing it however, i started to feel like it was just a bigger pulsar with some extras included for around half the price. 

whats got me interested:
-shower head water distributer
-drip stop valve
-comes with a metal mesh filter BUT FITS STANDARD AEROPRESS PAPER FILTERS!!!! 

as for downsides:
-i dont know if it was designed to deal with hot water. OXO can definitely make stuff out of plastic that can handle the heat, but this was purpose built for cold brew...
-it does require more effort because the dripper is like the clever dripper and just opens and closes with the carafe. 


i just cant justify buying a pulsar when i have this and i already decided to ignore it in favor of the switch for now anyway. 

if theres anyone here with a pulsar thats willing to get the OXO to compare, i would love to hear results because i dont have the skills, confidence, palatte, or tools i would need to really break this down in a comparison. if it is close, it could become a way to get a cheaper or larger pulsar for those who wanted one.",20,1728310667.0,pourover,5,0.93,False

I've tried several prompts nothing looks like a coffee bursting out of an launching rocket. I use stable diffusion 3, but I also can use sdxl. 

Here are some prompts I've already tried:

* Soviet propaganda poster, rocket bursting out coffee
* Soviet propaganda poster, A rocket launching, bursting out of coffee instead of rocket exhaust
* Soviet propaganda poster, towering Soviet rocket launching as steaming coffee bursts outward from its body
* Soviet propaganda poster, A massive Soviet rocket lifting off, coffee explosively streaming from its base

Any advice on improving my prompts or getting better results would be greatly appreciated!
