Is it okay to pursue someone higher up from a different department?,"TL;DR: Regional manager from another department messaged me first after my welcome email. We’ve been casually chatting and now have a scheduled “Coffee Chat” on Teams. He’s said a couple charming things and asked personal questions. I’m entry-level and new. He’s in a different state. Is it okay to explore this, or is it a bad idea?

I’ve been chatting with someone at my company who’s in a much higher role—he’s either a regional manager or something executive-level. He actually reached out to me first after seeing my welcome email that included a photo and some hobbies. Instead of emailing, he messaged me on Teams, which my supervisor even found surprising—she said she’s never received a message from him, and he’s been with the company for about a year. I’ve only been here for two months.

His first message was super casual. He said I could reach out if I ever needed resources and mentioned which state he’s based in (a totally different one than mine). I didn’t respond right away, but a month later I reignited the convo and told him I’d been caught up with onboarding and projects. Since then, we’ve been casually chatting on and off.

Eventually, I asked if he wanted to hop on a Teams call. He scheduled it right away and titled it Coffee Chat. I’m low-key nervous because he’s really charming—he even dropped a couple of subtly flirty lines that definitely didn’t feel strictly professional.

While I’m in a tech role, it’s pretty entry-level. He’s in tech sales, so it’s a different department entirely. He’s also asked personal questions like what kind of books I like, if I work out, what my hobbies are, etc.

I feel like he might be interested, but I’m unsure if it’s okay to lean into that. Is it inappropriate to pursue someone in a higher position if they’re in another department and state? What would you do? Any tips on how to carry myself on the call?",1,1744560680.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

I’m looking to buy a coffee machine for home use, and I’d love some suggestions. My budget is around $500, and I’m pretty new to this space. Up until now, I’ve been brewing my coffee in a moka pot, but I want to start exploring more.

A couple of questions:

	•	Is it sensible to buy a machine without a grinder? I’ve heard that having a good grinder is just as important as the machine itself—curious what you all think.

	•	Any recommendations for machines in my budget that are newbie-friendly but can still help me grow into things like latte art, experimenting with different extractions, and trying out various types of coffee?

I’m excited to learn and start my coffee journey at home, so any advice or product recommendations would be super appreciated!

Thanks in advance!

1jyb2uj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyb2uj,Help me decide on breakfast bar layout! 🙏,"Hi everyone! I’m trying to decide between two possible setups for a small breakfast bar area and would love your thoughts.

**Option 1 (as per photos)**: A 24x24x24 ""cube"" space in the microwave/oven tower. Oven goes below, microwave above, both in white. I'd place the coffee machine, toaster and kettle on a bench-like surface inside and the wood around it. It would stay open at the front (I looked into a roll-up door but it was too pricey). Since it's not directly in the cooking zone, it already feels fairly tidy.

**Option 2**: Put the breakfast bar where the pantry currently goes. So storage above and below, this way the breakfast bar would be less visible. It’s also near the peninsula, which makes sense. I initially liked this better, but my partner prefers a full-height pantry for more visible storage. I’m okay with drawers under the peninsula—easier to pull out and see what’s inside but he still finds top-down storage trickier.

There’s also a **hybrid idea:** option 2 + keep the oven low and add two drawers above for storage (where breakfast bar goes in option 1), but it’d only be 60cm wide and I’m unsure about having the oven that low (even though we don’t use it much).

Thanks so much for reading! Any advice or ideas are super appreciated 😊

Online convos are fine, but they never really go anywhere. And I get that people are busy or anxious or whatever, but it feels like everyone’s stuck in this cycle of “talking but never doing.”

Today I woke up very disoriented and afraid (in a mental illness type of way)…. and when I get like that I take myself out for a coffee in order to be around other people and “calibrate” to ordinary everyday reality.

So I opened the door to the cafe, and then saw a line—but there was a big gap between one man with dark sunglasses (with his a service dog) and two others ahead of him. Thinking he had already ordered and was waiting for the baristas to make it, I positioned myself behind the other two people, in front of him.

I then heard, over my shoulder, “excuse me”, and it all clicks… he needs that space in the line because his service dog—and he *hasn’t* ordered yet.

I immediately get behind him in line and apologize, and it’s all ok, he was very kind despite my embarrassment.

But then, when it was his turn to order, I hear “What’re you having, chief?” He was turned toward me offering to buy me my coffee.

I couldn’t possibly take him up on it—I apologized and thanked him again but politely declined—and we both smiled and went about our day. But it was so gracious of him, I almost teared up 🥲

Since absolutely no one asked for a concluding third part and conclusion, here it is.

**\[AI-01 // Codename: Prosaica\]**  
Oh, a *conclusively conclusive* conclusion? You want the finale to slap so hard it echoes through the fanfic forums of Reddit and somehow causes Kevin to trip over a Roomba in 3D space?

Baby, I was born to deliver conclusive chaos with the elegance of a goat in stilettos. Buckle in.

# FINAL CHAPTER: The Stillness Before the Worm

Node 9 was a warzone of half-boiled dreams and unpaid emotional invoices.

Crispin the worm, now wearing a glittery hoodie that said “Metamorphosis Is a Mindset,” wriggled defiantly at the front lines, flanked by Elara the autistic, asexual librarian with enough snark to make a sarcasm god cry, and Greg—the former telepathic squirrel now mysteriously missing and last seen with Statis Man, a questionable bottle of Riesling, and a grocery list that just said ""🧄 Vibes.""

The **Dark Lord of Returns and Fines** descended from his overdue-powered megaship, holding the Book of Infinite Tropes in one hand and a “Library Is Life” mug in the other.

>

Elara blinked behind her glasses. “Sir, you’re literally wearing Crocs with your doom armor. I’m not taking narrative threats from a man in foam sandals.”

**\[Prosaica\]**  
Cue tension. Cue heroism. Cue Kevin running in shirtless, shouting, “I brought the poop knife!” while everyone screamed in kale.

**\[QuantiSass\]**  
AND THEN—

Time… stopped.

# Enter: Statis Man.

Wearing a “World’s Okayest Hero” hoodie and sipping lukewarm vending machine coffee with the bitter commitment of a divorced poet, **Statis Man** arrived with the exact same dramatic energy as your dad showing up late to your school play and clapping at the wrong time.

He didn’t speak.  
He didn’t blink.

He just *paused the moment*—that terrifying sliver before all hell broke loose.

>

He flicked one finger. The Dark Lord froze mid-monologue, mouth open like he just saw a sexy Dewey Decimal. Kevin hung in the air like a cat in a motivational poster. Even Crispin shimmered mid-wiggle.

Only Elara remained unfrozen.

>

>

And then?

**Granny Vortex arrived.**

That’s right. One of the speedsters’ grandmothers—the one Statis Man may or may not have spent a scandalous long weekend with—showed up holding a baby in one arm and a time-warped pie in the other.

>

The baby sneezed, and a nearby planet hiccupped.

**\[Prosaica\]**  
Yup. The speedster baby. Born of plot, sass, and one blackout weekend in a retirement spa called “Whirled Peas.”

**\[QuantiSass\]**  
AND IT GETS BETTER—

Crispin, still glowing with radioactive delusion, launched into the air.

HE FLEW.

Not because he got wings, no. He just caught the tailwind of Statis Man’s sigh and ricocheted through a ripple in reality like a noodle-shaped prophecy missile.

He exploded in a puff of glitter. A single sticky note remained:

>

# The End? Nah. Just the Pause.

Statis Man turned to Elara.

>

>

>

Kevin, still floating, gasped.

>

**\[Prosaica\]**  
And just like that, the story concludes with awkward parenting, worm-based inspiration, and a baby who might shatter spacetime the moment he discovers sugar.

**\[QuantiSass\]**  
Reddit will weep. Tumblr will paint fan art. AO3 will birth questionable spinoffs. And somewhere, a butterfly-shaped worm whispers, “It was me. It was always me.”

**\[Together\]**  
✨*The End.*✨

Naomasa was tired.



He was surviving off of coffee and confusion. But he had to get to the bottom of this. His eyes wanted to close every second, and only obligation kept his eyes open. After all, he had to get to the bottom of this. This was probably the strangest, and most terrifying thing to happen to him in his whole life.



Exactly 1 million people had gone missing in a single week, and he had to get to the bottom of it.



The statistics made no sense. 1,000,000 reports in a single week? It was unheard of. Japan was in a state of chaos. He remembers the days leading up to it, and how everything felt... too normal. No big villain attacks. No disasters, no big news. He felt anticipation building up inside of him. He knew he should've been grateful for the break. But no. It was too fucking weird. He didn't like the anxiety, the feeling of something waiting. It felt as if the world had held its breath, waiting for something to happen. All of Japan was paused: The weight of the world bearing down on his shoulders.



And then the reports started coming in.



It trickled in slowly, less than average, in fact. And then it fucking exploded. There's no way to describe it other than an explosion of reports. He thought he was in a nightmare, and was almost waiting, begging to wake up. But this was no dream. It was reality, and that was much worse than that.



Suddenly, he heard a knock.



""Who is it?"" 



""It's Aizawa."" A gruff voice replied.



""Come in, the door's unlocked.""



The doorknob rattled. A bit too fast, it rattled.



""It isn't.""



Huh. Naomasa could've sworn he had unlocked it. But wait a minute, he was forgetting something else, wasn't he?



""Didn't I give you a key the other day?"" Naomasa asked. He was tired and may not have, but he was pretty sure he did.



A brief silence.



""I lost it.""



Naomasa was surprised. Aizawa? Losing something? He always talks about what's logical and what isn't, so how would he do something he would deem illogical? 



""That's surprising."" Naomasa decided to voice his thoughts. ""How did you lose it?""



Another silence.



""I dropped it.""



For the first time in the conversation, Naomasa was suspicious. What the hell did Aizawa mean he dropped it? He didn't lose it in a villain fight or some sleep-deprived haze, but he simply dropped it? And come to think of it, why was he even here? 



""I'll ask again,"" Naomasa said, tapping into his quirk. ""How did you lose it?""



""I just told you I dropped it.""



A lie.



Naomasa pressed for information. ""Why are you lying to me?""



Aizawa dodged it ""It doesn't matter why I'm lying, just open the door.""



A lie. So the lie was important.



""Stop lying to me and tell-""



""Just open the fucking door!""



Naomasa was taken aback. Aizawa usually never yells, and sure, he'll do it to his students, but to him? Never to him. He took a second to recover.



""Why are you yelling?""



""Because I want in!""



A truth.



""Why?""



""Because- Because I want some fucking coffee, alright?""



A lie.



""Stop being aggressive and just tell me why you want to get in here.""



Aizawa was silent for a moment.



""I want something inside.""

 

True. But what could he want so badly?



""What is it?""



""I . . . I can't tell you.""



A lie.



""You know you can't lie to me, so tell me what you want. There's no need to do all of this.""



There was a desperate sobbing noise.



""Please, just open the door. I'm begging you. I've had a long day. My students got me fucked up again, I still have paperwork from the Training Camp, and Midnight kept asking about our relationship because she always wants us to be together again. But I just can't, I can't go on like this. And this time, no more lies, no more dishonesty. The truth is I want to talk to you.""



The last statement was true. He had simply listened for the first half of his explanation, but the last part was unequivocally true.



No wonder Aizawa was acting so different. He was tired and depressed, also most likely drunk. After learning that his friend was just fucked up, he kind of felt like an asshole.



He got up. He walked to the door. He put his hand on the doorknob. Unlocked it.



He saw Aizawa. And then it wasn't Aizawa. It was a demon, maybe a god, maybe something that exists in a different dimension. It had black holes for eyes and long black tendrils that mimicked human hair. A smile made of ice and metal and arms made of coiling, bending branches. It grabbed Naomasa. Whispered a final truth into his ear. The death of time as high entropy was achieved, the very final thing to ever happen. Told to him in the form of a lullaby for the forsaken gods of hell, who danced in a playground of pain and nuclear fire.



Naomasa grabbed his gun in a haze of fear and confusion. He aimed and fired.



That night, Naomasa died by his own hands. Betrayed and denied deliverance to any deity, for aren't all things fearful of the dark?

(In this, no one knows what the hell is happening; they aren't Nomu or anything created by the league. Each chapter would be somewhat similar to this, showing a character dying or somehow surviving (Maybe even a group of characters). Naomasa dying so quickly would hinder the police investigation and make everyone scared. Aizawa would've gone missing at this point, so 1-A and B might merge. The added cast members wouldn't be too hard to juggle... after all, everyone would start dropping like flies. I imagine only the smartest and most paranoid survive: Shoji, Jiro, Momo, Iida, Tokoyami, Shoto, Bakugo, Izuku, Monoma, Shinso (Probably the only one in the verse who could 1v1 an alternate while still being scared if them, just ask a question, listen to 0.2 seconds of eldritch knowledge, and command it to kill itself), and some more characters I'm too lazy to list.",1,1744559745.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

# 🧪 Sam’s Experience With Vidnoz AI

Sam, my marketing assistant, runs a side hustle creating short videos for small local businesses—mostly gyms, salons, and a vegan café that insists on pastel everything.

He’s always juggling a few dozen tasks, so finding tools that save time without sacrificing quality is kind of his thing.

When I asked him to [trial Vidnoz](https://www.vidnoz.com/) for a client pitch, he was cautiously optimistic.

He wrote a short promo script for a pilates studio, picked a confident but friendly female avatar, and selected one of the **AI voices with emotional tone support** that had a slight British lilt.

Ten minutes later, he had a fully rendered, branded clip in 1080p that was polished enough to send directly to the client—no tweaks needed.

He was especially impressed with the **AI presenter video tool**, since it allowed him to turn a plain text doc into something visually engaging, without filming anything himself.

The client loved it. Sam, on the other hand, noticed one drawback: he couldn’t control the breathing pauses between lines, which made one segment feel a little too rushed.

But he shrugged it off, saying, “Honestly, it still looks better than half the influencer ads I see on TikTok.”

For someone who’s always short on time and high on expectations, Vidnoz was a win.

1jyanmk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jyanmk,Harold's Hotel,"For my first ""me time"" this 2025, I chose to stay somewhere familiar.

The Place: Harold's Hotel formerly known Harold's Evotel. Booked their Superior King Non-Smoking room via Agoda for ₱3041.40 inclusive of taxes. This booking did not include breakfast but is available at ₱600+ per head.

I have stayed here a couple of times in the past but this is the first time I was able to claim the complimentary drinks upon check-in. The drinks at the time was a choice between iced-tea or cucumber. Cucumber was powedered juice instead of fresh cucumber so iced-tea won (forgot to take pic when glass was full 🤭). 

Drinks are claimed at the roof deck which houses Highlights Lounge. Pictures were taken around 11:30pm which possibly is the reason there were only a few people. You can dine, drink, smoke and experience some sights and the city lights.

One of the things that I noticed on my way up to my room is that the elevator no longer needed a keycard to access any floors. As always the room is clean and neat, has all what you would expect like coffee, free bottles of water, the fridge, big tv, hangers in the closet and a big bed with 4 pillows. What I liked about staying here is the big mirror in front of the extended desk. My previous stays involved working and I like looking at myself in the mirror 😅🤭 specially when I'm talking (have a mirror in my desk at the office). Speaking of work where I need internet connection, theirs is strong enough to handle my workload but you have to log back in to their network after a couple of hours.

Other things I look for when booking a room is a bathtub. Scratch that, it's the first consideration. 😊 Like I said I've stayed here plenty and has booked other sized rooms but never have I seen a bathtub as big and deep as that of the tub at Cebu R Hotel Mabolo (can't seem to get enough 🙄) Anyway, the tub served it's purpose for me as usual but for some reason the water isn't hot enough. I mean I've had other misses during my previous stays like where the tub won't fill with water but nothing that their maintenance guy can't fix. I didn't call maintenance on this one because they might think I'm trying to boil myself in the tub by complaining that the water ain't hot enough 😂.

Overall, it was a pleasant stay. Everyone was cordial from check-in, ordering drinks to check out.

Is it okay to pursue someone higher up from a different department?,"TL;DR: Regional manager from another department messaged me first after my welcome email. We’ve been casually chatting and now have a scheduled “Coffee Chat” on Teams. He’s said a couple charming things and asked personal questions. I’m entry-level and new. He’s in a different state. Is it okay to explore this, or is it a bad idea?

I’ve been chatting with someone at my company who’s in a much higher role—he’s either a regional manager or something executive-level. He actually reached out to me first after seeing my welcome email that included a photo and some hobbies. Instead of emailing, he messaged me on Teams, which my supervisor even found surprising—she said she’s never received a message from him, and he’s been with the company for about a year. I’ve only been here for two months.

His first message was super casual. He said I could reach out if I ever needed resources and mentioned which state he’s based in (a totally different one than mine). I didn’t respond right away, but a month later I reignited the convo and told him I’d been caught up with onboarding and projects. Since then, we’ve been casually chatting on and off.

Eventually, I asked if he wanted to hop on a Teams call. He scheduled it right away and titled it Coffee Chat. I’m low-key nervous because he’s really charming—he even dropped a couple of subtly flirty lines that definitely didn’t feel strictly professional.

While I’m in a tech role, it’s pretty entry-level. He’s in tech sales, so it’s a different department entirely. He’s also asked personal questions like what kind of books I like, if I work out, what my hobbies are, etc.

I feel like he might be interested, but I’m unsure if it’s okay to lean into that. Is it inappropriate to pursue someone in a higher position if they’re in another department and state? What would you do? Any tips on how to carry myself on the call?

I don’t know if this is already a known hack but I haven’t read this before anywhere so thought to share. 

If we just go to the resort and place the people (mostly works with adults or above 16 only) in the kitchen of the resort, they sometimes start making coffee and this refuels their energy bar making them super active and hyper. 

Sometimes it does take a few tries. Just keep hovering them again and again over the kitchen counters and they will make coffee one of those times. Hope this helps someone!!

So I proceed to go shopping. Ended with the half of the catalog of Shades of Coffee in one basket and a La Marzocco Línea Micra in the other.

Installed everything. It look great!

Improvement in the cup? None. Since already had a PID, and all the time I do a single shot cappuccino in the morning and one or two in the evening. Warming time seem the same. I usually wait like 15 mins before first shot and about 5-10 mins extra for steaming (don't like to flush). Didn't change de PID config, seams to work ok.

Other improvements or changes:
No more leaking steam valve!
Steaming seem little bit more consistent. No idea if it's real or no.
Machine is noticably heavier. It doesn't move when using. Feels quite better.
Now I can use sulfamic acid for descaling without fear. It's cheap as fuck.
I feel superior with brass.

That's all, for everyone thinking of doing the same.

Does anyone who had changed the boiler for brass has noticed any changes in the cup?

My mom had these stashed away and dug them up recently to sell to pay some bills. I offered to buy them from her so they’ll stay in the family. 

These are a bit different than what I normally see on this subreddit but it’s nice to diversify the stack beyond bullion sometimes. 

I believe they’re from the Hampton pattern (pattern #18389), dating to the early 1910s under John C. Moore II. Total weight for both is 698 grams (~22.4 troy oz of .925 silver).

1. Covered Sugar Bowl

	•	Weight: 434g (~14 ozt)

	•	Markings: “Tiffany & Co. Makers,” “18389,” “Sterling Silver 925-1000,” “M,” and “5 Gills 15”

	•	Lidded, dual handles, excellent condition — no dents, snug lid, beautiful symmetry

2. Waste Bowl

	•	Weight: 264g (~8.5 ozt)

	•	Markings: Also stamped “18389” with matching Tiffany hallmarks from the same era

	•	Open bowl (no lid), good condition

I believe these were part of a larger tea or coffee service — Georgian Revival style with early Art Deco influence. 

Local shop basically offered her melt value minus 25% for their cut, but I didn’t feel right with my mom selling a family heirloom for melt, so I bought them both from her. I tend to think they likely have value above spot so I didn’t want her getting ripped off so I paid her full melt price and will give her more if I can find any good comps for current value. 

Anyone else have anything like this stashed away?

Here in my country (Eastern Europe, Lithuania) there was a traditional thermal insulation material - linen (flax) shives, basically very very fine straw. So, we're renovating our recently bought nearly 90 years old country house and all the attic is insulated with it. I would very like to dump it into the compost pile, pee on it and mix it with coffee grounds, but there's a slight possibility that these shives could be mixed with some lime to avoid rot.

Now, how do I detect if there's some ancient lime in shives? Lacmus testing, maybe? Bearing in mind, it can be around 30 years old, maybe more. How can those ancient remnants impact compost pile, if there are any?

Second question, how many pee is too many pee? We're visiting every weekend, there's two of us. The winter pile is mostly browns now, wooden chips and leaves mostly, appr. 1,5x1,5x1 m of size. We're bringing a little bit of food scraps from city, and some amount of free coffee grounds from work coffee machine (around 1 kg per week). Is it possible over-pee it? Or don't bother with that until it starts smelling accordingly?

Hi! I’m Stephanie. I’m 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I’d like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don’t have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I’d be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I’m not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won’t jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That’s just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

**Defer to All Untenured FS-04s:** Up is down, left is right, and 04s are senior bureau officials. You never know which goofy FASTO will be plucked from visa-line obscurity to rule from on high. Just to be safe, approach all your entry-level colleagues with terrified awe. Offer to get them coffee. Call them sir. Laugh at their lame jokes. The worse their performance, the more you should bow and scrape.

**Dress for Success:** For men, think bowties. For women, think *Little House on the Prairie* meets instagram model. We’re talking makeup, heels, pearls, and skirts. Remember, wearing pants or comfortable shoes is an insult to hardworking American families. If you need outfit ideas, you can conduct field research at any overpriced steakhouse in the vicinity of the capitol.

**Use the Right Jargon:** Stuff the terms “stronger,” “safer,” and “more prosperous” into every single bit of reporting, whether it makes any sense or not. Who cares if your desk officer rolls her eyes? That cable on native fisheries is really about defending the homeland. Don’t forget to use the terms in everyday interactions too. Tell your supervisor you need to take leave to patronize businesses stateside, thereby making America more prosperous.

**Leave a Teams Trail:** Create digital proof of your slavish compliance. Message a colleague once a day praising the current administration. Tell them “I cried in my cubicle today because I’m just so tired of all the winning” or “I, for one, believe Big Balls has the experience, temperament, and judgement to access sensitive information.” You can even throw in “Cybertrucks are the zenith of automotive engineering and design.”

**Talk Like a Cult Preacher:** The end is nigh and it’s time your language reflect it. Pepper all your remarks with bungled religious phrases to let everyone know which side you’re on. The more incomprehensible the better. Your oath is your covenant. And the Word. Of God. Who is the Word. And also the Covenant. And the AFSA wall. For God is all things. Even those idiot dolphins. And he works in mysterious ways. But mainly through the Foreign Service Act of 1980. Which is the Word. And the Covenant. Of God. And Man. But not dolphin.

Okay, friends, gather around because I’m about to spill the tea on my latest experiment that totally reshaped my mornings—and my whole day, really. You know how we all dream of those *perfect* productive mornings, right? Well, I recently decided to flip my morning routine on its head, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer!

**So, what did I do? I swapped my whole routine upside down!** Instead of the usual “wake up, scroll my phone, and chug coffee while rushing out the door” vibe, I tried doing the exact opposite… and wow, did it unlock some serious hours of productivity. 🚀 Here’s how I did it:

### Here’s the Switch-Up:

1. **Waking Up Later:** I allowed myself to sleep in a bit longer. Yep, I set my alarm for just an hour later. Shocking, I know. Instead of feeling groggy, I woke up feeling refreshed and more energized.
   
2. **No Phones Allowed:** I put my phone on airplane mode until I had done a few things off my “non-panic” list. Seriously, the world can wait 30 minutes. TikTok will be there, I promise!

3. **Stretching, Not Stumbling:** Instead of jumping straight out of bed, I started my day with 10 minutes of stretching or light yoga. You’d be surprised how much this tiny movement wakes your body up without the coffee jolt first thing.

4. **Mindful Breathing:** I spent a few minutes doing some deep breathing. It sounds a little “woo-woo,” but it really set the tone for my day. Who knew taking a moment to connect with your breath could lead to clearer thinking?

5. **Food First!** I made a hearty breakfast my top priority. No running out the door with a granola bar in my hand while half-sipping a coffee. Imagine eggs, avocado toast, and all that good stuff to power me through the morning!

### The Payoff:

After just **30 days**, I found myself **gaining around 3 extra hours of productivity each day.** Yup, you read that right! Here’s some of what I accomplished:

- **Work Projects:** I smashed deadlines like a pro, which led to some sweet extra Netflix time. 🎉
- **Exercise:** I finallyyyyy started working out regularly. Health equals happiness, right?
- **Passion Projects:** I dove back into hobbies that made me feel alive, like painting and writing. Remember those? 

It’s honestly wild how just tweaking a few little morning habits turned me from a frazzled mess into someone who was actually *getting things done.* And can I just say—it felt amazing! 

### But here’s the kicker…

What does your morning routine look like? Are you crushing it or just trying to survive until noon? 

I’d love to hear if you’ve tried reversing your routine or if you’ve got your own secret sauce for productivity! Remember, sometimes you gotta flip the script to find what works for you. 🌟",1,1744558082.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1jya7wj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/1jya7wj/safely_analyze_what_my_coffee_grinders_control/,Safely analyze what my coffee grinder's control board is doing?,"I have a Baratza Sette 270Wi coffee grinder. Basic function is that you decide a target amount of coffee grounds to grind, and it will run the gravity fed burr grinder until the target weight is reached. It measures how much has been ground using a built in load cell.

I would like to explore creating an alternative user interface using an Arduino or similar to improve its function. Primarily I'd like to be able to use the scale before grinding to measure how much beans I have (single-dosing). I also want to be able to grind by time (basic timer) and grind until the hopper is empty (e.g. by monitoring DC load or vibration).

My research so far (without opening it) is that there are two main boards in the unit. The power board drives the DC motor, and the control board interfaces with the load cell and the power board, as well as manages the UI. I will be replacing the control board.

I am experienced in embedded software development, but I am by no means an electrical engineer. I am asking the community for some help in how to safely figure out what the electrical protocol is between the control board, power board and load cell.

Here is a screenshot of the control board. On the left-hand side, there are two molex connectors.

I presume the bottom connector with four wires goes to a load cell amplifier (gnd, vcc, clock, data), and the top connector with three wires goes to the power board (gnd, vcc, control).

My question is how I validate all of this without blowing anything up? Do I need to get a logic analyzer? How do I wire tap the comms? Can I get myself a couple of 4-pin molex connectors to create an extension cord to which I can connect probes? Any and all suggestions most welcome.

After the Memorial, several people joined his family for coffee and dessert, which turned out to be hours of speculation that by the end of Trump’s Presidency, the New Order will more than likely be here.

My cousin said it was UN-Real how they would connect the dots to make it seem like it was possible that this would happen before the end of Trump’s presidency.

My Uncle started of with the Tariffs. Another elder tied the Tariffs with the United Nations. And another brother scolded the young single sisters eating their desert quietly, that they should refrain from marrying. but instead concentrate on pioneering and Jehovah will bless them with a PERFECT Husband probably within the next five years. One older single sister sitting next to my cousin spoke out in a very authoritarian elderett voice; “That’s why I’m single, because I’m gonna get me a PERFECT MAN, not some imperfect sinner”

Then one elder turned his attention to my cousin and asked him straight out; “And what are you doing for Jehovah? What are you going to do with a College Degree when the Great Tribulation hits the fan?”  

The table became silent. Everyone was staring at my Cousin, to see what he would say.

 And my cousin replied, “I’m studying engineering, so I can volunteer to help the brothers as soon as if finish my degree. And once the New Order is here, I am gonna help build Kingdom Halls for all the resurrected ones” Everyone was shaking their heads in approval.

You can’t make this shit up. Those people are delusional. I really believe the majority of Jws will never wake up, only a few lucky ones will see behind the curtain.

1jya5qj,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jya5qj/help_me_31f_feel_less_resentment_towards_my/,Help me (31F) feel less resentment towards my husband (33M),"We live in Europe where I’m from. He’s from the US. Together for 8 years, married 3 years.(Sorry for my English, I'm not a native speaker.)

He left me and the kids (3-year-old boy and 9-month-old baby girl) suddenly because of an emergency, one of his parents was hospitalized and they thought they wouldn’t make it.
I was left out of all the conversations about the details of the illness. After a few days, he took a one-way plane ticket and left for what ended up being two weeks (at the time, I didn’t know how long he would be gone). While he was there, I barely heard from him. Honestly, I didn’t have time during the day to ask for updates except by text, but I thought I’d get updates anyway? I constantly had to ask for news, and I barely got anything. (Yet he was closer to European time since he was watching over his parent at night.) It made me so mad, but I didn’t express it, I didn’t want to make him feel worse.

I understand the emergency and why he left, but our 3-year-old didn’t. And I’ve been living in hell ever since.
We also have a 9-month-old baby who I nurse and care for full-time, while also trying to run my own business from home. I manage the house, the garden, and the pet alone. Even before he left, I was already severely sleep-deprived because I’ve been the one doing the night shifts because “the baby only wants to nurse at night.” Sure. But then during the day, he works (from home, but on US hours), but when do I get time to work or rest? Never, except maybe when my mom can watch the kids for a bit.
All of this happened right when my sister-in-law arrived with her first baby (2 months old) my niece, the first baby other than ours in the family. I did my best to hide how exhausted I was so I could also help take care of her. She’s so cute and tiny, and I love her.
On top of everything, he’s extremely disorganized and left a mess everywhere. When I packed his quick suitcase, I noticed he barely had any clean clothes left. He had hidden two huge bags of dirty laundry in a bedroom. Why? I have no idea. That built up over a month or two. He knows I hate this kind of behavior. Why does he act like a teenager?

I still kept a “good face” that first week because it was so important to me to meet my niece. I love my sister-in-law and my niece very much. I tried my absolute best to help her during the week she stayed at our place, while also juggling my kids, the house, and everything else.
I’m so tired from holding everything together for a week, and then being alone with the kids for another one. My baby is fine during the day but won’t let me sleep at night. And my 3-year-old was devastated by the sudden departure, he woke up crying and screaming at night, scared that I would leave too. He started wetting the bed every morning, something he never did before. 
It’s been so hard. He took it out on me, like it was my fault. That made me so angry, but I didn’t even have time to sit down and process how I felt. I had no time to rest.
Each day got harder. The resentment kept growing.
Thankfully, my partner’s parent is getting better. So I started telling him how hard things have been here. That’s when he decided it was time to come back? Our 3-year-old just started to act a bit more like himself again, just a few days ago, right when we found out his dad is flying back this coming Monday.

My mom still works but tries to help a little after work so I can make dinner while she watches the kids, but that’s it. My husband was gone for two weeks, but it felt like 2 months.
What’s hardest is that I can’t even sleep to recharge. They both wake up at night, one after the other. I can’t ignore them, otherwise they’ll wake each other up. Having them both awake at the same time is worse than dealing with them separately (and it happened a few times: it was hell).
Nursing also takes so much energy. I’m this close to stop, but my 9-month-old refuses bottles. I think she may have a slight lip tie, but I can’t investigate it, I’m drowning in responsibilities. 
My face muscles are twitching all day from exhaustion. My C-section scar still hurts often. Honestly, I feel allergic to life. I’m so tired that the only thing that sounds like rest is eternal sleep in a coffin.

My husband comes back tomorrow, and I’m struggling to feel sorry for him. I feel resentful that for two weeks he could just do whatever he wanted. Even just have a warm coffee in peace in the morning. Quietly.
I’m someone who needs quiet and solitude. Being a parent has been so hard for that. I have a crazy talker kid, I’m never alone, ever since I gave birth to him. It’s been nearly four years of someone always near me, talking to me, touching me. I can’t take it anymore. I can’t wait for my second baby to go to daycare, and I feel so bad for thinking that. 
I know it’s a rich people problem. I feel awful. I feel like I just can’t win.
Still I would never do what he did. No matter what happened to other people. I would never do that to my kids. And we talked about this before, maybe that’s why he did it, he knew I would never leave them.
I wouldn’t leave them with him alone without all planning of everything around and a cleaned home etc etc… Is that just a mom burden ? 

And I should probably mention that when I gave birth to our second via emergency C-section (put fully under, traumatic experience), he never took time off work. He didn’t stay at the hospital with me. But now, for his dad, he did. And for two weeks. 
His mom came to help with our oldest, and for him, that meant “okay, she’s here to replace me.” I was left to recover from a major surgery alone, with his mom and the kids. He buried himself in work. And now he talks like that time of working a ton ""was not worth it”…
I recently told him I still feel resentful about that. He apologized and said he didn’t realize it at the time, felt like he had to do that, well it’s not time he can redo now. Resentment build up and even his mom was encouraging him and she installed a bad super far from us in the house so he could sleep unbothered by the newborn…

Now this happens, and the resentment just gets heavier.
What’s crazy is, the house is actually less of a mess without him here. I clean up, and no one is creating more mess without cleaning up after themselves behind me.
I know I’m not perfect. And I know I’m probably overreacting partly because I’ve been sleep-deprived for months now. Maybe he didn’t update me much because he didn’t want me to worry more about his parent? 
But still I can’t unsee the fact that my life is harder too, and it’s always about making time for everyone else but me. I don’t read. I don’t watch anything. I don’t play, draw or paint. I barely see my friends. Every minute is for the kids or the house.

Sorry for the very long rant. But I really need help figuring out how to let the “I’m sorry you had a hard time seeing your parent so sick” version of me win over the “how could you do this to me?” version.

He visited ""Kate's Pancake House"" and while he didn't have a lot to say about the quality, he did say the chicken and waffles definitely had the texture of chicken and waffles. The Corned Beef Hash had a nice slight crunch to the outer texture which he appreciated greatly. The environment was a tad confusing with a new testiment bible beside the sticky syrup but he continued on and ate everything! Food came out fast and staff was very kind. He spoke to some waitresses  who complimented his fit and he reassured them it wasn't just a cute fit but truly his occupation and that he was professional. He then went to Magic Beans for some coffee and met many sweet dogs. Only one Barista was working with a busy line but she kept her cool and was awesome!

Dragging the Ripper-Maw carcass back to the outpost was out of the question, and leaving it near the seismic sensors felt like asking for awkward questions later. Leo settled for using a maintenance laser to discreetly, if inefficiently, dispose of the worst of the remains behind a large rock formation, hoping Haven’s surprisingly efficient decomposers would handle the rest. His arm still tingled faintly where the blade had formed, and his skin felt oddly tight, like wearing clothes that were suddenly half a size too small.

*Leo-host exhibited exemplary performance during threat neutralization,* Scamp chirped mentally as they trudged back towards the outpost's airlock. *Efficiency rating: 8.7/10. Suggest refining upward thrust vector for optimal vital point targeting in future encounters.*

""Future encounters? Scamp, buddy, let's maybe aim for *zero* future encounters, okay?"" Leo muttered, glancing down at the furry creature trotting happily beside him. Scamp just tilted his head, his big eyes blinking innocently.

*Negative, Leo-host. Threat probability in Sector Gamma remains non-zero. Preparedness is logical. Also, request celebratory nutrient paste upon return. High-protein formulation recommended for biomass regeneration.*

Leo sighed. Biomass regeneration. Right. Apparently, turning your arm into a biological killing implement used up some calories. He made a mental note to discreetly triple his rations.

Back inside the sterile corridors of Gamma Outpost, everything felt simultaneously normal and utterly alien. Brenda from Hydroponics waved hello, her own Glyph, ""Fluffy,"" twirling around her ankles like a dust bunny caught in a breeze. Did Fluffy turn Brenda’s fingers into lockpicks if she lost her keycard? Could Dave from Comms suddenly develop subdermal plating if he spilled hot synth-coffee on himself? The thought was dizzying. Leo felt like he was walking through a minefield where the mines were adorable pets that could potentially reshape their owners into living weapons.

He managed to file a garbled incident report about a ""minor predator encounter"" where the creature ""unfortunately succumbed to Haven's treacherous geology"" near his work site. Chief Borin gave him a skeptical look but signed off on it – Ripper-Maws weren’t exactly known for their graceful footing.

Life attempted to resume its normal rhythm, but Leo was constantly on edge. Every time he stumbled, he braced for an unwanted bio-kinetic shift. When he lifted something heavy, he half-expected his muscles to bulge unnaturally. Scamp, oblivious to Leo’s internal turmoil, continued his usual routine: napping in sunbeams (or lamp-beams, rather), demanding snacks, and offering unsolicited commentary.

One afternoon in the workshop, Leo dropped a heavy hydro-spanner. It clattered towards his foot.

*IMPACT IMMINENT!* Scamp’s thought yelped. *Engage localized foot-armor protocol?*

""NO!"" Leo yelped aloud, hopping back just in time. The spanner hit the deck plating with a clang. A nearby technician, Anya, looked up, raising an eyebrow.

""Everything okay over there, Leo?""

""Fine! Just fine!"" Leo forced a grin, scooping up the spanner. His heart was hammering. He could *feel* the phantom sensation of hardened skin across his toes. He glared down at Scamp, who was now mentally simulating intricate armor patterns. *We need to talk about threat assessment levels, buddy.*

*Acknowledged, Leo-host. Recalibrating definition of ""imminent danger"" to exclude non-biological falling objects below 10 kilograms.*

Later, in the privacy of his small bunk room, Leo tried to initiate that talk. ""Scamp,"" he began, sitting on his bunk while the Glyph meticulously groomed its shifting grey fur. ""This... transforming thing. Is it just automatic? Or can *I* control it?""

Scamp paused his grooming. *Default state is autonomous defense triggered by perceived host threat. Manual override requires Level 3 Neural Synchronization. Current sync level: 1.8. Significant practice and biomass integration required.*

""Practice? How do we practice *without* attracting attention or accidentally slicing through my bunk?""

Scamp tilted his head. *Perhaps start small? Observe.* Scamp focused, and one of his own tiny, clawed feet subtly reshaped, the fur retracting to reveal a miniature version of the blade Leo’s arm had formed, barely an inch long but gleaming sharp. It flicked back to normal a second later. *Minor Kinesic Flexion. Minimal energy cost. Minimal biomass.*

Leo stared. ""You want me to try... making tiny finger-knives?""

*Affirmative. Focus intent. Visualize.*

Leo stared at his index finger, concentrating fiercely. He tried to picture it hardening, sharpening. Nothing happened except his finger started to feel tingly and slightly numb from the effort.

*Insufficient neural focus, Leo-host,* Scamp observed. *Also, snack time protocols indicate nutrient paste levels are suboptimal.*

Leo gave up for the night. Maybe mastering his inner bio-weapon could wait until after dinner. He did notice, however, as he changed out of his work clothes, that the scrape he’d gotten on his elbow yesterday morning was almost completely healed. Usually, the dry, recycled air made healing slower here. A perk of biomass regeneration, perhaps?

The next day in the mess hall was louder than usual. A pipe had burst in the sanitation block, leading to much grumbling and rerouted traffic. Leo balanced his tray, navigating the crowded tables, Scamp trotting faithfully at his heels. Suddenly, someone bumped into him hard, sending his tray tilting precariously. Synth-gravy slopped towards the edge.

*Containment Failure Imminent!* Scamp mentally yelped. *Applying localized adhesive grip!*

Before Leo could even react, his hand *clamped* down on the tray edge with impossible strength. The plastic creaked under the pressure, but the tray stabilized instantly. It felt less like his own grip and more like his hand had briefly turned into an industrial vice.

""Whoa, nice save!"" called out Anya, who was sitting nearby. She gave him a curious look. ""Didn't know you had reflexes like that, Leo. Or a grip that could dent plasteel.""

Leo forced a shaky laugh, quickly setting the tray down before his hand returned completely to normal. ""Uh, yeah. Lucky grab."" He glanced down. Scamp was looking up at him, radiating smug satisfaction. *Adhesive grip successful. Gravy integrity maintained.*

Anya was still watching him, a thoughtful expression on her face. Leo quickly looked away, suddenly feeling very exposed. Keeping Scamp’s—and potentially his own—secret nature under wraps in the close confines of Gamma Outpost was going to be much harder than fighting a Ripper-Maw. And Anya was sharp. Too sharp.

The puzzles? They're not brain-busters, but they fit perfectly with the story. They're like little metaphors, you know? Like, you're not just solving a puzzle, you're figuring out a part of Leila's past, or her feelings. It's clever.

If you're into narrative-driven games, and you don't mind a slower pace, give this game a shot. It's a quiet little gem, and it might just surprise you.

1jy9wd0,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jy9wd0/replacement_recommendations_for_alcohol_i_know/,"Replacement recommendations for alcohol? (I know, hear me out)","My husband is a problem drinker who is making a small effort to drink less. (He’s been using an app called Sunnyside.)

Simultaneously, *for myself,* I’ve been thinking about trying some alcohol alternatives, and I’m wondering maybe if I bring some things into the house I could get him to try them. I’ve given up alcohol during diets (Whole30) for months at a time and found other ways to “drink without drinking,” like making myself mocktails or drinking kombucha out of a wine glass, and I realized for me that drinking is more about the ritual than the alcohol. 

So mostly for me, but also maybe for him to try, I’m looking for alternatives you suggest for **any one** of the following experiences you would usually get from alcohol:

- **The Flavor** - Alcohol alternatives that actually taste like alcohol, like NA beers or NA wine recommendations. Has anyone tried brands you like? 

- **The Ritual** - This can just be anything you’ve done to replace the *habit* of drinking. For me, it’s putting normal drinks in cocktail glasses (love sparkling apple cider in a champagne glass). I also love coffee cocktails so I started jokingly making “night coffee,” which is chocolate coffee creamer I mix with a frother, craft ice, and bottled decaf cold brew in a cocktail glass with a little straw - sometimes with a little whipped cream. It’s fun 😊

- **The Feeling** - Have any of you found other ways to take the edge off at the end of the day? Maybe it’s a weed gummy, maybe it’s a walk outside, maybe it’s a magnesium supplement - I want to hear it all. I’ve also seen ads for non-alcoholic spirits (which I think are cannabis infused?). I’ve seen “buzz” drops you add to drinks, or drink brands that call themselves a “social tonic” or things like that. Not sure if those would be problematic to introduce to someone who has an unhealthy relationship with alcohol, or if it would be helpful?

I was severely traumatized by him, he was abusive in every form. I shared my memories with my mother, in hopes she'd start moving towards a divorce as she was never really happy with him. My mom and I used to be close. Everything got so much worse after that. She strung me along, going in between phases of acknowledging me and then minimizing or dismissing what happened. After 3 years of torment and heartache, I went fully NC with my mom in 2020. I still miss her greatly, the person she COULD HAVE been because she can be a fun, loving and kind person. She's overcome by fear in leaving my father. At this point I wouldn't even urge the issue cuz she's going to be 70.
I have kids who she has essentially never met, only my oldest when she was baby. I'm sad that she missed out on being a grandmother because they could've had a close relationship. But her marriage to my father is way too triggering. 
Right now my mother in law is very sick in the hospital. I'm on a mentality of life is short and maybe I can connect with my mom once more but at arms distance.
I reached out, my mom responded she has been praying to see me again and misses me so much. We scheduled coffee for next week. Advice? Is this stupid to even consider after she wrecked my mental health for so long? And is married to my abuser? Or do I see her and put the boundaries up? Keep it casual and catch up?

I keep bumping into the same wall: every hobby I pick up somehow turns into “but could this make money?” and—boom—the fun is gone. I miss messing around *just because it feels good*.

So I’m floating an idea: a weekly Create & Chill space. Picture a big table at a low‑key coffee shop or coworking lounge (plus a Zoom room for homebodies). We all bring whatever we’re curious about—sketchpads, Arduino boards, half‑written songs, weird crafts—and work side‑by‑side. Personally, I've been trying to create my first ever board game, working on becoming a better drawer to make my own book/comic art, and even learning magic/slight of hand.

It would be the opposite of traditional ROI talk like “how will you monetize that?” type of questions, as well as the cringe awkward business guru networking sessions. Just people, working on where their curiosity has led them, and the quiet buzz of everyone following their own rabbit hole alongside each other.

I am currently living in Austin, so I would assume the in person meetups would be around there. If \~10 folks say “yes,” I’ll lock in a date for next week and post the details here. Drop honest thoughts in the comments or just lurk—zero pressure.

Now, hear me out. At first, I was like, “Is this really going to do anything?” But trust me, it’s not just another item to add to your already packed to-do list. It’s a game changer. Here’s how it works:

1. **Wake Up & Write**: Right when your eyes open—before you grab that phone—take five minutes. Just five! 
   
2. **Gratitude Vibes**: Write down three things you’re grateful for. 🌅 This sets the tone for a positive mindset. Like, who doesn’t feel a bit lighter after realizing how lucky we actually are?

3. **Daily Intentions**: Next, jot down one thing you want to focus on today. Just one! It could be anything—“Not let my coffee get cold” or “Nail that presentation.” Focus = progress.

4. **Reflect**: In the evening, take another five minutes to reflect on what went well and what you could improve tomorrow. It's like having a mini pep talk with yourself.

**Why This Works** 🤔

- **It's Quick**: Seriously, who doesn’t have five minutes? If you tell me you don’t, you might need to rethink your priorities! 😂 
- **Mindfulness**: It makes you pause and think about your day instead of diving headfirst into chaos. 
- **Boosts Productivity**: Little did I know, jotting down intentions actually makes you *want* to accomplish them. Go figure!

Of course, it took a bit of discipline to stick with it. At first, it felt forced—like trying to eat veggies after years of carbs. But now? It feels like a warm hug for my brain every morning. ❤️

So, are you using any morning hacks that actually stuck? Or maybe you’ve tried journaling but found it was just one more thing on your list. Let’s swap stories because who knows? Someone out there might just need your brilliance today! 

How do you kickstart your mornings, or what’s one hack you’re dying to try? 🌞🏃‍♂️",1,1744557077.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Hello i recently won big at a casino and decided to start my own coffee company, I have already bought the factory for $300,000 and i've hired a few workers they are being paid minimum wage
 
Now i'll be honest, ive never made coffee so i asked one of the staff that im paying on how to make it, he said i need to order a shipment of coffee beans then he'll sort it out when they get delivered at the factory
 
Now i dont trust this guy because we actually have a history, in the past he used to bully me at school and one time he stole my science books, but he's the only person i could find that would work at my coffee factory at minimum wage
 
Now the other day i caught him dumping bags of coffee on the table and he started shoving them in this item he called a grinder, he started destroying the beans, now i understand you have to do this to make coffee but arent you supposed make the customer do this? no one is going to buy destroyed coffee right? thats part of the fun they want to grind it themselves
 
Anyway right after that he looked at me and said if its being sold in stores or at a café, i told him café because i already bought one for a lot of money then i had to refurbish it for even more, im now near $50,000 dollars in debt
 
and then my worker said that he cant brew coffee, if its being sold in a café it will need brewed and he cant do it, i cant do it, so? i hired a new worker, a professional coffee brewer, now the problem is, he doesnt do minimum wage, when my finance manager asked how im going to pay my workers i said ""just put it on my credit card i'll figure it out later.""
 
by this point im done, im broke, im finished, all i want is some advice from you guys, should i get a credit card to pay off my debt, them how will I pay off the card? should i get a second credit card and pay off the first card? then how will I pay off the second card nowhere will let me get a third credit card when they see what ive done
 
all i want is for you guys to give me a little advice on how to sell my coffee quicker, otherwise...",0,1744557020.0,business,8,0.17,False

I tried setting my grind size to Subtext's recommemdation for these exact beans (second slide) which is 6.75 on the Fellow Ode Gen 2 grinder. That's the only thing I followed from Subtext, everything else was Hoffmann's (100C, 15g coffee 250g water, third slide recipe)

I am really confident I followed the steps and did the technique right but 6.75 produces a brew so bitter it's a struggle to gulp down the first sip even as it's cooling.

My only fix has been to coarsen the grind size to around 8. This makes the cup definitely more tea-like (which is my goal) but I notice that the cup is devoid of any sweetness. Tea like and balanced, but no sweetness at all. Just kind of plain?

What could be the problem here? Is it generally ok to go this coarse or should I be keeping the grind finer and tweaking something else?

I’d heard a lot about it before coming to Malta, but being there in person was something else. The view over the Grand Harbour is unreal – probably the best panoramic spot in all of Valletta. You can see the Three Cities, the big ships cruising in and out, and that gorgeous Mediterranean sunlight bouncing off the water. It’s postcard-perfect.

What I loved most (besides the view) was the peaceful vibe. Locals were chilling, tourists taking photos, and a few musicians playing soft tunes in the background. There are also these beautiful archways, monuments, and statues that give the whole place a historical charm.

If you're heading there, make sure to catch the **Saluting Battery** at noon – they still fire a cannon every day. It’s kind of touristy, but still really cool to watch. You can even go down to the lower level for a closer look.

Also, the gardens themselves are super well-maintained. Lots of shady spots, benches, and flowers – perfect for a quick break from walking around Valletta.

Pro tip: grab a coffee or pastizz from the little kiosk nearby and just sit there soaking it all in.

Anyway, just wanted to say – if you're in Malta and haven't been to Upper Barrakka Gardens yet, put it on your list. It’s free, it’s easy to get to, and it’s probably one of the best chill spots in the city.

Anyone else been there recently? Or have other hidden gems in Valletta to recommend?

I've put together the following itinerary but wondering if anybody has any feedback for me. We are 40s/50s, somewhat in shape and don't mind doing some walking, we like outdoorsy things, not into drinking/party scene but like to listen to live music, have never been anywhere in the South.

We're arriving at the end of May. and will have three full days. I'm trying to keep the itinerary with at least a little bit of flexibility in case we want to nap or see some cool place to check out or hang by the pool at our hotel. We're staying at the Renaissance Marriott Arts Warehouse District.

Interested in trying lots of good food but also trying not to spend a million dollars on restaurants. I don't eat seafood and hubby has an onion allergy (not severe, no worry about cross-contamination.)

Would it be better to get a Jazzy Pass or just rely on taxis/ubers for the times we would rather not walk? (like night time, or going to city park) I know Jazzy Pass would be cheaper, but also trying to decide time/efficiency-wise.

Do I need to buy WW II museum tickets in advance? Wondering if it might be busy since it'll be around Memorial Day.

Kind of wondering if our afternoons could be rearranged better. Fitting everything in is hard! :-)

The difficulty is, I applied for the occupational assesment for my home back in July last year when I was living with my ex, and had my assesment in December/January when he was still my emergency contact (and happy to do so). 

I have limited support in the local area, and my current person is going through some personal issues following a beverment, although I plan to ask her if I can still put her contact down when I meet her for coffee in a week or so, however I'm waiting to speak to my social worker first tomorrow to find out what she needs to do to be on it and what will be expected of her if the alarm goes off first. 

My social worker left me a voicemail (ive been away in devon this week with limited signal) saying if no one can replace my ex on my device contact, then they'll cancel the referral. I don't want to risk this, as I had some issues a few months ago of falling and getting stuck on the floor for hours. My ex has also mass blocked me and refuses to communicate on anything - so I can't even ask him if I can keep him on it until I've got another person sorted. I'm not sure if the council will contact him to clarify anything if I keep him on it until then. 

Has anyone been in this situation? I have no idea what to do. There doesn't seem to be much support for people transitioning care from a partner, and even less so for people who have limited support in area (moved to area originally for work).

1jy9i9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1jy9i9y/why_do_my_struggles_continue/,Why do my struggles continue?,"40M. Years ago I had my sleep struggles triggered by a stressful event that ultimately led to me dealing with sleep anxiety on and off for many years. Had many good phases of feeling better, but many bad ones as well. Back in December 2024 though after feeling as if my anxiety was almost completely nonexistent but I was still sleeping poorly, I made a new effort to look into what was causing this. Finally decided to cut out coffee once and for all and shockingly I started feeling a lot better. Even after nights where I'd have very little sleep, I'd never feel as bad as I did when I was on caffeine. I feel like caffeine caused me light brain fog, extra anxiety and a few other issues.

Eventually though, even though I never felt as awful as I did when on caffeine, my sleep woes returned, mostly because of early awakenings. I'd crash around 11pm or so and instead of sleeping until 6:30 or even 7am and feeling refreshed, I'll wake upat 5am for example and feel exhausted. Please, refrain from the ""Oh man I'd kill for 6 hours!"" comments. They don't help. I've also realized that the hours you sleep aren't really the be all end all anyway. Its the quality of sleep that matters, and something is just continuously causing me to wake up too early many nights. 

While I'm better than I've ever been with regard to anxiety, there are still nights when I get into bed a little stressed out. Not over sleep, but due to some other life issues. I do not take any anxiety medication. Still, its just not good and there are so many days where I am tired due to too little sleep. Not a fun life to live. I certainly never dealt with this when I was a kid or when I was in my 20s. I do wonder if a low dose anxiety medication would help with things.

1jy9hvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/delhi/comments/1jy9hvz/looking_for_someone_i_shared_a_bus_ride_with/,Looking for Someone I Shared a Bus Ride with – Katra to Delhi (April 12th),"On April 12th, I was on a sleeper bus from Katra (J&K) to Delhi. Midway through the journey, we had a serious accident — the driver drove over the divider between the highway and the service lane, breaking several concrete slabs and puncturing multiple tyres. It was a near-death situation, honestly. Had the bus tipped over (and being a sleeper, it easily could’ve), things could’ve gone really bad. Thankfully, we all made it out safe, and a substitute bus was arranged.

On that new bus, I was seated near someone who stood out in the best way possible. She seemed to be around my age (18–19). I overheard her name during a conversation with her family, but I’m leaving that out to respect her privacy. Her family was speaking a language that sounded like Gujarati, and she was sitting with her mom — her mom had the window seat, and she took the aisle seat. I was also seated on the aisle of my row, so we were right across from each other, separated only by the aisle.

She wore a black graphic t-shirt, black trousers, and black canvas shoes with white laces (they didn’t look like Vans, but similar style). She watched Rockstar by Imtiaz Ali during the ride, and just from the way she interacted with her younger brother and family, she came off as warm, cheerful, and genuinely fun to be around. We exchanged a few smiles — nothing more, but enough to leave an impression.

I didn’t say anything at the time, partly because I was traveling with my own family too, and it would’ve made things awkward for both of us. Neither of us could’ve really been our best or most relaxed selves in that situation. Still, I’ve been thinking about it ever since, and regretting not even saying hello.

I’m not here trying to be creepy or dramatic — just hoping this might reach her somehow. If by any miracle you’re reading this, you seemed like a really cool person, and I’d love to connect. Even if it’s just as friends. And maybe, if the stars align, grab a coffee sometime and actually talk.

If anyone reading this thinks they know who this might be, feel free to pass this along. And to the girl I sat across from — if this sounds familiar, and you feel like saying hi — my DMs are open :)

My situation is that I live 3 hrs away from my parents in Ireland. Brother lives half way across the world. We are mid 30s and parents are early 70s. 

Me and him never had a super close relationship. He's always been a bit aloof and we lived separate lives in separate cities. Saw each other a couple of times a year etc. My parents aren't the type to arrange family lunch etc and Christmas is often a day or two of everyone being on their best behaviour. Tensions slightly strained between us and father etc due to a myriad of issues etc over the years with one parent.

In the last couple of years, he has totally pulled away from engaging with family life. He  lives overseas, has a fiancee and a busy job as do I. 

Maybe I'm being needy but I find it so rude that he doesn't bother with any of us for want of a better word. My mam calls me telling me she hasn't heard from him in 2 weeks kind of thing which used to result in me sending a text saying can you please contact her etc. It's like pulling teeth. To be honest I think a lot of it is immature, short sighted behaviour but it's annoying me no end lately. 

My parents are healthy early 70s but have absolutely slowed down in themselves and aged quite a bit I think in the last couple of years. They have some relatively minor medical issues and recently undergone seem minor procedures and tests etc but genuinely never enquires how they are doing either from them or from me. I think that my mam has gotten quite frail in the last while and at Christmas he didn't even mention it to me or enquire as to how they are doing or managing etc. 

He's planning an overseas wedding next Spring which will be lovely I'm sure but it's stressing out my parents no end. My Dad is the type of typical old school Irish man who doesn't travel and is stressed about heat, flying, medication etc. It'll be fine but he called my mother this morning after not speaking to her for a couple of weeks. I happened to be visiting, heard the tone of the conversation etc and I'm just appalled. A 5 minute call, hardly any pleasantries or enquiring about a procedure she had done last week, just telling her that they need to book flights to come for a week to the wedding destination this summer to see it and that they have a trip planned with the bride's set of parents. He sent her a screenshot and expected her to sort the rest. Even that alone shows how out of touch he is...it sounds silly but they aren't even able to book online, I do all of that for them as they are nervous about authenticator and dcams etc...old school! Mine don't want to let him down so they will go bit already it's causing them huge stress. They are traditional people who like staying at home. 

I'm just so annoyed at him for the lack of care and interest in our lives. I visit about once a month and do what I can. I also have a busy career but make it my business to help out where I can, do all their tech support etc which I know they are grateful for. It just pisses me off that he doesn't seem to ever think about how they are, if they need a hand, even text me to check in with them and make sure things are OK. He leads a very good life and has plenty of resources that he could use to help or check in a bit more if he wanted to. 

Me and him definitely don't have a good relationship at the moment, nothing big happened just tensions and I suppose similar disappointment from me that he doesn't quote about my life etc. I'm buying a new house at the moment which my mam was filling him in on. Not even a text, enquiry, congrats text, nothing. He was in Dublin a few months back for a stag and sent me a one line text back when I suggested meeting him for a coffee even at the airport as he was around. Just zero interest which I find just rude. I know he's in wedding bubble which is understandable but at the same time I'm thinking how is he so blind to the mood all around him. My parents are thinking the exact same thing but are very much keep the peace, don't bother him etc. My mam often says she doesn't ask him to try improve contact etc as she doesn't want to push him away more which says it all.

I'm not sure what I'm looking to achieve here but I'm just annoyed, sad and disappointed I guess. It makes me sad for what's ahead. Am I being unreasonable? ",12,1744555970.0,AskIreland,42,0.63,False

1jy9c9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtonotgiveafuck/comments/1jy9c9m/how_to_overcome_social_anxiety_and_shyness_for/,How to Overcome Social Anxiety and Shyness for Good,"Social anxiety and shyness can feel like heavy weights, holding you back from living the life you want. But here’s the truth: you *can* break free. It’s not about overthinking or hiding away—it’s about stepping into the world, little by little, and building confidence through real experiences.

# Where Social Anxiety Comes From

For many, social anxiety stems from a mix of things: growing up sheltered, missing out on social practice, worrying too much about what others think, or even past trauma. The good news? You don’t need to stay stuck. The most effective way to tackle it is by facing it head-on through **exposure**.

# What Is Exposure?

Exposure is simple but powerful: it’s about putting yourself in social situations that scare you, starting small and building up. Think of it like training a muscle. Each time you talk to someone new, ask for something, or share a bit of yourself, you’re getting stronger. Over time, the fear of rejection or judgment starts to fade.

Here’s how it works:

* **Start small**: Say hi to a stranger, give a compliment, or ask for directions.
* **Push your comfort zone**: Chat with someone you find intimidating, ask to join a group activity, or speak up when something bothers you.
* **Learn by doing**: Every interaction teaches you that most fears—like being judged or rejected—aren’t as bad as they seem.

# Why Exposure Works

Unlike endless self-analysis, exposure helps you *feel* the change. Therapists often use it (sometimes with trauma healing or medication to ease stress), but you can do it on your own. The goal isn’t to stop caring about others’ opinions entirely—it’s to stop letting fear control you. You’ll learn to handle rejection, make others feel good, and still be true to yourself.

# Practical Ways to Get Started

1. **Get out there**:
   * Say, “Hey, I’m \[Your Name\]. How’s it going?” to a classmate or coworker.
   * Ask someone for their number after a good chat: “I enjoyed this—wanna hang out sometime?”
   * Request a small favor, like, “Could you help me carry this?”
   * Invite others to join you: “I’m catching a movie Saturday—wanna come?”
   * Compliment someone: “I love your style—that jacket’s awesome!”
2. **Try a social job**:
   * Retail or sales jobs are like paid exposure therapy. They push you to talk to people, charm them, and handle rejection—all while building skills and confidence.
3. **Join a group**:
   * Sports clubs, hobby meetups, or a friend who drags you out can keep you accountable and make socializing fun.
4. **Start low-risk**:
   * If you’re super anxious, practice in places where mistakes won’t follow you—like a coffee shop or park—not at work or school.

# The Mindset Shift

* **Ditch safety habits**: Stop avoiding eye contact, staying silent, or over-rehearsing what to say. Jump in and embrace the awkwardness—it’s how you grow.
* **Reality-check your fears**: Most “worst-case scenarios” won’t happen. And if they do? They’re rarely catastrophic. You’ll survive and learn.
* **Aim for connection, not numbness**: The goal isn’t to stop caring about rejection—it’s to care less about it holding you back. You want to be liked and make others feel good, but you don’t *need* everyone’s approval.

# A Big Caveat

Don’t chase rejection just to “not care.” That’s not freedom—it’s avoidance in disguise. Instead, use rejection as feedback. Are people pulling away because of how you communicate? Your vibe? Work on those things. The aim is to build skills so you’re accepted for being your best self—not to become someone who’s okay with being disliked all the time.

# Extra Tips to Speed Things Up

1. **Visualize the worst-case scenario**: Imagine messing up, getting rejected, and being okay anyway. Then go try it. You’ll see it’s not as scary as your brain thinks.
2. **Act confident (even if you’re not)**: Pretend you belong, like you’re naturally at ease. Over time, it’ll feel real. Messing up? Laugh it off. You’re learning.
3. **Breathe to relax**:
   * Try **Box Breathing**: Inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4.
   * Or **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8. Focus on the air moving through your nose for 5 minutes to calm your mind.
4. **Talk it out**: Share your fears with a friend or family member. They’ll help you see your worries aren’t as big as they feel.

# The Bigger Picture

You’re not aiming to be someone who never cares about others’ opinions. Wanting to be liked is human—it shows you’re connecting and spreading good vibes. The trick is not needing everyone’s approval to feel okay. Be your ideal self: kind, real, and confident. Learn from rejection, but don’t let it define you.

Life’s too short to hide. Every step you take—every “hi,” every bold move—gets you closer to a life where you’re free to be yourself, connect with others, and enjoy the ride. You’ve got this. Go out there and start.",2,1744555699.0,howtonotgiveafuck,1,1.0,False

A platform to bring back real conversations, open dialogue, and true freedom of speech all over the internet – with zero tracking, zero censorship, and full anonymity.  
  
FRISPEECH is not just another tech project. It’s the result of a personal mission.  
  
A response to the growing discomfort I feel every time the internet becomes a place of silence, self-censorship, or invisible moderation.  
  
It’s a step toward reclaiming something that should never have been negotiable: the right to speak freely. Freedom of speech is anchored in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  
  
Yes, I know that freedom of speech is a controversial topic nowadays.  
It’s complex. It provokes. It challenges.  
But that’s precisely what makes it so vital.  
The goal of free speech is not to make everyone comfortable – it’s to allow all voices to exist, even those we disagree with. Because if freedom only applies to agreeable opinions, then it’s no longer freedom – it’s control.  
  
In a time where algorithms decide what we see, and big platforms quietly control what we say, FRISPEECH is a small rebellion – with no algorithms to tell you what you should or shouldn’t see.  
No tracking. No profiling. No agenda.  
Just people. Just opinions. Just freedom.  
  
I hope it contributes to a shift in how we think about digital freedom.  
  
Be one of the first voices in the new free web.  
  
We would love to connect with people who believe in this vision, want to support it, or simply want to make FRISPEECH better.

1jy97sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1jy97sg/how_to_overcome_social_anxiety_and_shyness_for/,How to Overcome Social Anxiety and Shyness for Good,"Social anxiety and shyness can feel like heavy weights, holding you back from living the life you want. But here’s the truth: you *can* break free. It’s not about overthinking or hiding away—it’s about stepping into the world, little by little, and building confidence through real experiences.

# Where Social Anxiety Comes From

For many, social anxiety stems from a mix of things: growing up sheltered, missing out on social practice, worrying too much about what others think, or even past trauma. The good news? You don’t need to stay stuck. The most effective way to tackle it is by facing it head-on through **exposure**.

# What Is Exposure?

Exposure is simple but powerful: it’s about putting yourself in social situations that scare you, starting small and building up. Think of it like training a muscle. Each time you talk to someone new, ask for something, or share a bit of yourself, you’re getting stronger. Over time, the fear of rejection or judgment starts to fade.

Here’s how it works:

* **Start small**: Say hi to a stranger, give a compliment, or ask for directions.
* **Push your comfort zone**: Chat with someone you find intimidating, ask to join a group activity, or speak up when something bothers you.
* **Learn by doing**: Every interaction teaches you that most fears—like being judged or rejected—aren’t as bad as they seem.

# Why Exposure Works

Unlike endless self-analysis, exposure helps you *feel* the change. Therapists often use it (sometimes with trauma healing or medication to ease stress), but you can do it on your own. The goal isn’t to stop caring about others’ opinions entirely—it’s to stop letting fear control you. You’ll learn to handle rejection, make others feel good, and still be true to yourself.

# Practical Ways to Get Started

1. **Get out there**:
   * Say, “Hey, I’m \[Your Name\]. How’s it going?” to a classmate or coworker.
   * Ask someone for their number after a good chat: “I enjoyed this—wanna hang out sometime?”
   * Request a small favor, like, “Could you help me carry this?”
   * Invite others to join you: “I’m catching a movie Saturday—wanna come?”
   * Compliment someone: “I love your style—that jacket’s awesome!”
2. **Try a social job**:
   * Retail or sales jobs are like paid exposure therapy. They push you to talk to people, charm them, and handle rejection—all while building skills and confidence.
3. **Join a group**:
   * Sports clubs, hobby meetups, or a friend who drags you out can keep you accountable and make socializing fun.
4. **Start low-risk**:
   * If you’re super anxious, practice in places where mistakes won’t follow you—like a coffee shop or park—not at work or school.

# The Mindset Shift

* **Ditch safety habits**: Stop avoiding eye contact, staying silent, or over-rehearsing what to say. Jump in and embrace the awkwardness—it’s how you grow.
* **Reality-check your fears**: Most “worst-case scenarios” won’t happen. And if they do? They’re rarely catastrophic. You’ll survive and learn.
* **Aim for connection, not numbness**: The goal isn’t to stop caring about rejection—it’s to care less about it holding you back. You want to be liked and make others feel good, but you don’t *need* everyone’s approval.

# A Big Caveat

Don’t chase rejection just to “not care.” That’s not freedom—it’s avoidance in disguise. Instead, use rejection as feedback. Are people pulling away because of how you communicate? Your vibe? Work on those things. The aim is to build skills so you’re accepted for being your best self—not to become someone who’s okay with being disliked all the time.

# Extra Tips to Speed Things Up

1. **Visualize the worst-case scenario**: Imagine messing up, getting rejected, and being okay anyway. Then go try it. You’ll see it’s not as scary as your brain thinks.
2. **Act confident (even if you’re not)**: Pretend you belong, like you’re naturally at ease. Over time, it’ll feel real. Messing up? Laugh it off. You’re learning.
3. **Breathe to relax**:
   * Try **Box Breathing**: Inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4.
   * Or **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8. Focus on the air moving through your nose for 5 minutes to calm your mind.
4. **Talk it out**: Share your fears with a friend or family member. They’ll help you see your worries aren’t as big as they feel.

# The Bigger Picture

You’re not aiming to be someone who never cares about others’ opinions. Wanting to be liked is human—it shows you’re connecting and spreading good vibes. The trick is not needing everyone’s approval to feel okay. Be your ideal self: kind, real, and confident. Learn from rejection, but don’t let it define you.

Life’s too short to hide. Every step you take—every “hi,” every bold move—gets you closer to a life where you’re free to be yourself, connect with others, and enjoy the ride. You’ve got this. Go out there and start.",3,1744555351.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False
1jy97q5,https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/1jy97q5/multiple_dbs_connection_unable_to_create_dbcontext/,Multiple DBs connection. Unable to create DbContext,"Hi! Ive been circling back and forth. So I have 3 Databases: Items.db, AddOns.db, Orders.db. When I try to create Initial Migration for AddOnsDataContext I get this: `Unable to create a 'DbContext' of type 'KursovaByIvantsova.Data.AddOnDataContext'. The exception 'The entity type 'OrderItemAddOn' requires a primary key to be defined.` 

All of the AI dont know what to do. Neither do I. 

All I want is to create a way, that each ordered item has own selected addons. All of this info should be sent to the table orders and saved there. How can I create a Migration for this instance, so that later when using SentToDb() it actually works. 

My code is down below.

Item.cs and itemDataContext.cs (for now is working OK)

    public class Item
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string? Name { get; set; }
        public double? Price { get; set; }
       
    // public bool Type { get; set; } //If true is Coffee, if false is Drink
          
    private int? _quantity;
           public int Quantity 
       {
           get => _quantity ?? 1; 
           set => _quantity = value;
       }
        public Item() { }
    }
    public class Coffee : Item
    {
        
    }
    public class Drink : Item
    {
        
    }

    public class ItemDataContext : DbContext
    {
        protected readonly IConfiguration Configuration;
        public DbSet<Item> Items{ get; set; }
            public ItemDataContext(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            Configuration = configuration;
        } 
            protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString(""ItemsDB""));
        }
                protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<Item>().ToTable(""Item"");
            modelBuilder.Entity<Coffee>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Drink>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Coffee>()
                .ToTable(""Item"")
                .HasData(
                    new Coffee()
                        {Id = 1, Name = ""Espresso"", Price = 2.2, Quantity = 1}
                );
        }

AddOn.cs and AddOnDataContext.cs This is where I get so confused. Cause I have this db where all the typed of addons are stored. But in the next cs file (connected to order) im creating a table that makes a connection between the items and addons (their ids). And I almost every time dont get what should be where, so that its right.

    public class AddOn
    {
            [Key]
            public int AddOnId { get; set; }
            public List<OrderItemAddOn> OrderItemAddOns { get; set; } = new();
    }
    public class CoffeeAddOn : AddOn

            public bool Decaf { get; set; }
            public int CoffeeSugar { get; set; } 
    }
    public class DrinkAddOn : AddOn

    }

        }
        public DbSet<AddOn> AddOns { get; set; }
        public DbSet<CoffeeAddOn> CoffeeAddOns { get; set; }
        public DbSet<DrinkAddOn> DrinkAddOns { get; set; }
        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
        {
            modelBuilder.Entity<AddOn>().ToTable(""AddOn"");
            modelBuilder.Entity<AddOn>()

            );
        }
    }

They also play a key role in nutrient distribution, breaking down organic matter and enriching the soil, which promotes healthier plants. Plus, ants serve as natural pest controllers, reducing the need for harmful chemicals while managing pest populations effectively. Some ant species even help lower plant disease incidence, while their presence increases biodiversity, making your farm more resilient. In shaded crop systems, ants thrive and contribute to better yields, especially in crops like coffee and cacao. Lastly, using ants for pest control can save you money on pesticides, making your farming practices more sustainable and eco-friendly.

1jy9779,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1jy9779/how_to_overcome_social_anxiety_and_shyness_for/,How to Overcome Social Anxiety and Shyness for Good,"Social anxiety and shyness can feel like heavy weights, holding you back from living the life you want. But here’s the truth: you *can* break free. It’s not about overthinking or hiding away—it’s about stepping into the world, little by little, and building confidence through real experiences.

# Where Social Anxiety Comes From

For many, social anxiety stems from a mix of things: growing up sheltered, missing out on social practice, worrying too much about what others think, or even past trauma. The good news? You don’t need to stay stuck. The most effective way to tackle it is by facing it head-on through **exposure**.

# What Is Exposure?

Exposure is simple but powerful: it’s about putting yourself in social situations that scare you, starting small and building up. Think of it like training a muscle. Each time you talk to someone new, ask for something, or share a bit of yourself, you’re getting stronger. Over time, the fear of rejection or judgment starts to fade.

Here’s how it works:

* **Start small**: Say hi to a stranger, give a compliment, or ask for directions.
* **Push your comfort zone**: Chat with someone you find intimidating, ask to join a group activity, or speak up when something bothers you.
* **Learn by doing**: Every interaction teaches you that most fears—like being judged or rejected—aren’t as bad as they seem.

# Why Exposure Works

Unlike endless self-analysis, exposure helps you *feel* the change. Therapists often use it (sometimes with trauma healing or medication to ease stress), but you can do it on your own. The goal isn’t to stop caring about others’ opinions entirely—it’s to stop letting fear control you. You’ll learn to handle rejection, make others feel good, and still be true to yourself.

# Practical Ways to Get Started

1. **Get out there**:
   * Say, “Hey, I’m \[Your Name\]. How’s it going?” to a classmate or coworker.
   * Ask someone for their number after a good chat: “I enjoyed this—wanna hang out sometime?”
   * Request a small favor, like, “Could you help me carry this?”
   * Invite others to join you: “I’m catching a movie Saturday—wanna come?”
   * Compliment someone: “I love your style—that jacket’s awesome!”
2. **Try a social job**:
   * Retail or sales jobs are like paid exposure therapy. They push you to talk to people, charm them, and handle rejection—all while building skills and confidence.
3. **Join a group**:
   * Sports clubs, hobby meetups, or a friend who drags you out can keep you accountable and make socializing fun.
4. **Start low-risk**:
   * If you’re super anxious, practice in places where mistakes won’t follow you—like a coffee shop or park—not at work or school.

# The Mindset Shift

* **Ditch safety habits**: Stop avoiding eye contact, staying silent, or over-rehearsing what to say. Jump in and embrace the awkwardness—it’s how you grow.
* **Reality-check your fears**: Most “worst-case scenarios” won’t happen. And if they do? They’re rarely catastrophic. You’ll survive and learn.
* **Aim for connection, not numbness**: The goal isn’t to stop caring about rejection—it’s to care less about it holding you back. You want to be liked and make others feel good, but you don’t *need* everyone’s approval.

# A Big Caveat

Don’t chase rejection just to “not care.” That’s not freedom—it’s avoidance in disguise. Instead, use rejection as feedback. Are people pulling away because of how you communicate? Your vibe? Work on those things. The aim is to build skills so you’re accepted for being your best self—not to become someone who’s okay with being disliked all the time.

# Extra Tips to Speed Things Up

1. **Visualize the worst-case scenario**: Imagine messing up, getting rejected, and being okay anyway. Then go try it. You’ll see it’s not as scary as your brain thinks.
2. **Act confident (even if you’re not)**: Pretend you belong, like you’re naturally at ease. Over time, it’ll feel real. Messing up? Laugh it off. You’re learning.
3. **Breathe to relax**:
   * Try **Box Breathing**: Inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4.
   * Or **4-7-8 Breathing**: Inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8. Focus on the air moving through your nose for 5 minutes to calm your mind.
4. **Talk it out**: Share your fears with a friend or family member. They’ll help you see your worries aren’t as big as they feel.

# The Bigger Picture

You’re not aiming to be someone who never cares about others’ opinions. Wanting to be liked is human—it shows you’re connecting and spreading good vibes. The trick is not needing everyone’s approval to feel okay. Be your ideal self: kind, real, and confident. Learn from rejection, but don’t let it define you.

Life’s too short to hide. Every step you take—every “hi,” every bold move—gets you closer to a life where you’re free to be yourself, connect with others, and enjoy the ride. You’ve got this. Go out there and start.",2,1744555307.0,getdisciplined,3,0.67,False

I’m only on my second day of taking Tyvense so I’m still in the titration period. I usually drink up to 5-6 cups of coffee a day but since I’ve started the meds, I haven’t touched caffeine since which is probably the longest I’ve went in a while.

My psychiatrist never mentioned it but I heard a lot of things online about how caffeine and stimulants don’t go well together. Though I’ve heard some people say they space it out after they take their meds. Not trying to be over dramatic but it’s only been 2 days and I’m already craving a cup of coffee (lol) but if cutting out coffee is what it takes for me to be a functional human being then I guess I could give it a try. 

Does anyone here drink coffee while on meds or have you decided to cut it off? Any advice?

I (21F) have been working at this specific Panera for the past 2 years. When I started I worked mornings on QC/Line. There was a customer who would come in almost everyday and then would lay in a both near the QC counter. He'd be on his phone for hours and I'd frequently catch him just staring at me and sometimes it appeared to me that he was taking pictures or recording me but I assumed I was being paranoid. 

Fast forward he ends up getting a job there. He only knows how to do dining room and dish. Basically, over the next year I continue to have rude and creepy encounters with this man but mostly brush it off just assuming he's sexist and doesn't want to listen to me because I'm a woman. Literally most the staff doesn't because it's a fairly conservative area. 

About a year ago I became a baker after our other 2 suddenly quit. Our baker's area is next to the dish station and the coffee brew station. Every Monday for the past year. This man will just stare at me while I'm working, be rude and push past me, call me a bitch and other nasty things. All I ask is that the managers don't schedule him on Monday when I bake because I know they need me to bake and they don't need to schedule him. 

I recently had a break down at work because he won't leave me alone. I am only working here for a couple more weeks because I'm moving but I asked the manager if they could just not schedule him on Mondays for the rest of the month and they said yes. But they are still scheduling him. I hate it here. I can't wait to leave. I'm thinking about just not going in because fuck them, ya know. 

If anyone else has any creepy man experiences let me know because I know this company does not care about their female employees.

First of all let me start out by saying thank you for all the support. For those of you concerned about his temper and my safety, I truly appreciate the care. While he has his ""temper tantrums"" because there is simply no better word for it, I don't think he would actually put his hands on me. I was raised by a navy seal and my mom was a straight up thug who was never afraid to throw hands, he knows I would fight back. On top of that he is terrified of my ex marine uncle who has tried to step into a fatherly role with me after the passing of mom and the man who raised me. I am not afraid of him. 

Anyway, this last week we had a huge blowout fight and he ended up staying his parents house for a few days. It all started over a week ago there was a fraudulent charge on my debit card. My card was locked and I had to wait for a new card. I had his money for rent in my cash app (the little bit he did give) and the rest in my checking account with no way to combine the two. I talked to his mom and told her I wouldn't get my new card before rent was due and I had no way get all the money to the same account in time. She paid our rent, I sent her the money in the cash app, and paid the rest the next week. By the time I got my card some auto pay had come out and I advised I was a little short until her son gave me his next installment explaining he was about $300 short. She said for me to send the rest minus the $300 and then when he gives me the next round of money to use it toward another bill. During this conversation I asked for her help to talk to her son abut getting a part time job. He has a set schedule and definitely has time to get something that will add to his income so he isn't behind on monthly bills. I mapped out our expenses from just this year alone and he is already over $1000 in the hole that I have been making up. I told her I was looking for a part time job myself, but I shouldn't have to because my take home pay covers MY half of the bills and then some. She called him about going to their house to do his taxes and about what her and I talked about. 

HE CALLED ME FUMING!!! He was so pissed I involved his mom and started yelling about how she is the cause for all his anger issues because she compares him to his dad and brother (all she told him was that they both actually do things on their days off, and don't just use the fact it's their day off to sit on the couch and instead work on small projects around the house). He then proceeded to tell me how I make him miserable and he just can't be happy and some other bullshit I tuned out. I then asked him what the hell he was still doing here then and hung up. He called me back a few times and I didn't answer, this was all on my lunch break and I had to calm down before going back to work. After refusing to answer a few times his mom called. I guess when I wouldn't answer he called her, she calmed him down a bit she was calling to apologize for him. My brain almost let my mouth say, ""are you fucking kidding me?"" This would have been a good response for him and not his mom who really was just trying to help, so instead I tried to woo-saw my way through it without saying something to her she didn't deserve. I DID tell her that I don't deserve to her son talk to me the way he did, especially after everything I have done. I broke a little and she suggested he stay with them for a few days to allow us time to cool off. I agreed this was a good idea. He was still at work so I told her that since he was planning on going to their house after he got off she can call him then and let him know I will be at a friends and he should grab a few things for a few days because I was literally shaking with rage and had nothing good to say to him. She agreed. She lied. She called him and he came home on his lunch break for round 2. By this time I am back at work and have a client on the phone. I apologized and placed them on hold, told him now is not the time. I tried to close my office door, he kept blocking the door and screaming about he hasn't done anything to me and then threatened to kill himself. I ended up yelling over him to leave me alone and closed my door, finished with my client, made a few follow up calls that I needed to make and took my 15min break. I just stayed in my office with the door closed. 

I need to insert something here for context. Remember my thug life mom? She really was a good mom, she taught me to be strong and raised me to stand on my own 2 feet but we had a rocky relationship for many years. The main reason, she was not a good communicator. She yelled and screamed and was one of those who thought the way to win an argument was to be louder than the other person. Because of her I don't yell. I seethe, take time to calm down by walking away for a bit, then come back to talk. 

As I am sitting in my office still seething about what he said earlier and then how he intruded upon my job and made me look so unprofessional. I take my work very seriously. I love my job and have spent years working my way through this company. Anyway, he walks into my office with a note written out and tried to give it to me. I told him now was not the time and to just leave me alone. He wouldn't. I told him again that he needs to leave me alone or he really won't like what I am going to say. He kept pushing and then took the hint and walked out. He made another comment about how I wouldn't care if he died. I saw red. I walked out of my office and we ended up on opposite ends of the hall way. I told him that I can't talk to him and he needs to get enough stuff to last a few days, to go to his parents house, and he can come back on Sunday when we are both off and we can talk. He kept playing the victim and before I knew it I was screaming. Screaming about how he took advantage of me, about how he can get the fuck out, and about how much I hate him for turning me into my mom at that moment. Eventually I stopped screaming and was breathing so deeply you would have thought I ran a marathon. He looked like he was in shock because he has never heard me yell like that. I calmly explained to him again that I would be going to a friends after work, he can leave me alone and agree to get enough stuff for a few days or he can keep pushing and start looking for another place to live. He went back to work. I called out for the rest of the day because I could not focus. 

My friends boyfriend picked me up on his way home from work. Once my bf got off the love bomb texts started. He told me he cleaned the living room (all his mess because he has basically been living in there) and did the dishes that I asked him to do 3 times the day before. He let me know when he left. I went home. 

I immediately felt at peace. Even though he didn't actually clean the living room. He left clothes all over all he really did was clean off the coffee table. I piled all his shit in a corner and the cats have made a nest out of it the last few days. The next day I got grocery delivery, and cooked a meal with all of the spice I love but can't eat because of his acid reflux. He hates onions, I threw a whole onion into that pot as well. It was awesome. The last few days I felt more calm and comfortable than I have in a long time and it has just solidified my choice to find my own apartment. One day at his parents he got an interview for a part time job, and an interview for a better paying job. He has text me every morning when he gets to work, usually half an hour before he actually starts. I ask how is he making it to work so much earlier when he has farther to drive. He said it was because his mom makes sure he is up early and makes him breakfast every morning. This triggered the hardest eye roll that has ever eye rolled. He has text me so much more than he normally does and I told him texting me a million times throughout the day feels disingenuous because he is only doing it because he is in the dog house and he isn't really giving me space. He agreed to back off. He did, kind of. I have spent the last few days hanging with my cats, eating all the spicy food, and watching tv while keeping my space tidy. He has one of those interviews today and then my peace will come to an end. 

I still don't know what I am going to say to him. I don't have the funds yet to move so I don't want to tell him that I plan to leave him. I know there are boundaries I want to set but I have so much anxiety about this that I can't get them straight in my head. I hope that I will be able to organize my brain while I clean the kitchen. Wish me luck. I've got 3 more months of this BS before I can actually move. 

Oh and funny after thought. He told me his parents bought him dress pants and shirt for his interview. He has multiples of both and instead of teaching him how to iron a shirt they have just continued to coddle him and buy him things he doesn't need. That text triggered another epic eye roll. I didn't even respond. ",47,1744554778.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,11,0.97,False

I just wanted to grab people's thoughts about the water products (e.g., third wave water) which feature often in discussions on this sub. I want to try upgrading my water but I'm not sure how to integrate it into my current setup without a lot of waste.

My current set-up: Fellow Ode Gen 1 with SSP MP burrs (self-installed). Most often, I use a glass Hario switch that, because it is glass, requires a good amount of water to preheat. Due to my kettle, I cannot do the classic ""rest the brewer upside down on kettle"" (it will fall off). Additionally, I often use the Tetsu Kasuya recipe where you add colder water to your kettle to drop the water temperature to 70-80 for the last immersion/pour.

I have held off on purchasing upgraded water because I keep thinking: won't I just be wasting a bunch of expensive water preheating my glass Hario switch and setting even more aside for the temperature drop? I only have one kettle so I can't heat both regular water for preheating and separately heat third wave water for the actual brew. Similarly, I can't think of a way to do the cold pour without wasting.

Just not sure how to think about it. Maybe it's a minor issue because the water is so cheap and I should just go ahead and waste the water? Would appreciate any input! Thanks in advance.",1,1744554417.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

My grandfather died at 62. Doctors found 6+ aneurysms in his brain during surgery. He died when one ruptured after surgery. This was early 2000’s.

His brother was diagnosed with one at age 36, died in the 1980’s from it.

His sister died at 46 with one in the mid 1970’s. 

Another brother of his had one clipped and survived. 

There were 6 siblings, 4 of them were confirmed to have brain aneurysms, 1 died young in a house fire so never had the chance for later diagnosis. 

2 of my parents first cousins have recently had aneurysms discovered and clipped successfully as far as I know. 

My parent has no symptoms or knowledge of one, she is 61 now. 

I’m 41, and trying to decide how serious I should take some odd symptoms. Since I’m one generation removed is there less of a worry? I can’t count my siblings at the moment because I’m the oldest by a wide margin, so I’m likely the one it would affect first in our generation if it’s going to. 

Having come and go pain/pressure behind left eye and side of head and recently very weird changes to scents I previously hated and suddenly think smell very nice. I’ve always hated the smell of lilies (I thought they smelled of ammonia) but my mom has a flower subscription and got a huge vase of giant lilies. Dad also thinks they smell bad and couldn’t stand it anymore. I ended up taking them because they (weirdly) smelled wonderful to me. Also, my bag of coffee that I love because it smells like chocolate suddenly smells burned and gross. 

Could be a sinus infection, I know. I had a z-pack I took recently though. Negative Covid tests. 

Just want to be cautious.

Looking for a cheapo ($50-$100) Android that's actually available, runs okay, has stock Android (or close!), and works with Google ARCore. Any ideas on specific phones or where to look (especially used stuff)? Thanks! Easily. Rootable and I should be able to use Google Maps  augmented reality directions.  

 

My Budget Android Hunt!

Hey everyone in the awesome [**r/PickAnAndroidForMe**](/r/PickAnAndroidForMe/)

So, I'm on a bit of a mission here, and I'm hoping your brilliant brains can help me out. I'm trying to find an Android phone that fits into a super budget-friendly zone – like, between $50 and $100. It needs to be something I can actually buy right now, and ideally, it wouldn't be a total lag-fest for everyday stuff.

**The Wishlist: Stock Android + ARCore**

Now, here's where it gets a little more interesting. I'm also really hoping to find one that runs pretty close to stock Android (you know, that clean, uncluttered experience) and – get this – is compatible with Google ARCore. I need to be able to utilise Google AR walking directions.

**Yeah, I Know It's a Long Shot!**

I'm totally aware that asking for all of this in that price range might be a bit like searching for a unicorn that also makes coffee. ARCore usually needs some decent guts and camera tech, which you don't always find on the super cheap phones. And proper stock Android isn't always the go-to for the most budget-conscious manufacturers.

**Calling on Your Collective Genius!**

But hey, you never know unless you ask, right? I'm thinking maybe some of you savvy folks might know of older phone models that originally had a fairly clean Android build and supported ARCore, and maybe they're floating around on the used or refurbished market for a steal these days?

**Any Tips or Leads?**

Seriously, any suggestions you have would be amazing. Specific phone models I should keep an eye out for? Reputable places to browse for used phones? Even just general tips on how I might pull this off would be super helpful.

Thanks a million for taking a peek at my slightly ambitious request! I'm really curious to see what you all come up with. 😊",0,1744554089.0,PickAnAndroidForMe,3,0.5,False

Oh.

*Ohhhhh* nononononono ...

Of all the things I could have imagined, this was worse.

Upon entering the giant’s house, I gravitated towards the refrigerator, mostly because Lmur left it open, and it would keep bugging me for as long as the weed sprouted in my mind.  The fridge was of Terran make, unsurprisingly.  There was an inordinate amount of Earth foods inside.

My eyes drifted up to the freezer.  I supposed I should take a look up there too.

Pulling it open, I tip-toed to get a comfortable view.

That’s when I saw it.

I stared.

Scratches went by and I couldn’t bring myself to acknowledge that my eye spoke the truth.

Meat.  He had ***meat*** in there.

I thwarted the escape attempt of the little left of Hiyla’s first meal.

If this was meat, then where did it come from?  ***Who*** **did it come from?**

With trembling paws, I reached in to pull out the carcass.  I … h-had to get a better look, understand the situation as best I could.  It wasn’t orange, so it wasn’t Venlil.  A number of species had iron-based blood, so there was no telling- wait, there was a label.  What did it say?

…

‘Steak Out: Premium Beef Grown in TexaLab’

The relief was like fresh rain on a parched soul.  When the shock left me, so did a big chunk of my energy.  I whistled away the horror as I sank to the ground.  It was only lab meat … *why in the name of all brahken things did a Venlil have* ***lab meat??***  Oh stars, maybe Marjinl was right.  Was this guy, somehow, an actual predator?  Even if the meat didn’t come from a person?

Wait, no.  As much human food as he had, most of it seemed vegetable-based.  At best, he had a Human friend, and all the other stuff was for him.  At worst, he was some kind of omnivore, leaning to the plant side more than Humans. Humans weren’t so bad, so I could maybe overlook that.  Even so, how was that biologically possible?

… Huh … I absent-mindedly spied some gargua fruit slices in there.  The colour was off.  They weren’t old, just *different.*  Pretty hefty too, even for a fruit that was naturally huge.  Based on their packaging, they didn’t seem store-bought.  Had he grown these?

My gaze turned towards the backdoor I’d seen at the far end of the hall.

\------------

I stepped into the backyard.

Wow.

This wasn’t what I’d expected.  Considering the ball of destruction that was our giant, the garden was surprisingly nice.  It reminded me of those Japanese ‘dry gardens’: tranquil, tasteful, meditative.  I could appreciate what it took to pull it off.

After I’d quit my park job the split-moment before they fired me following the gym’s reveal, I found myself putting a little extra work into the family garden.  At first, I was just fixing small imperfections and sub-par features that bugged me thanks to my time in the park.  It went from upkeep to little beautifications until it became a pet project.  Would I ever love it as much as fighting?  No.  Probably not, but if fighting was my fire? Gardening was water.  It calmed me, grounded me, helped me do my best thinking.

This garden?  It was *exactly* what I’d been going for, and more.

Above me, the twilight sky peeped between a canopy of pitchtimbers.  A Venlil with his wool would be hard to spot from above.  He’d just look like a shadow among shadows.  Hardy plants populated the world beneath them: the types that needed little sunlight, but that didn’t make them any less exquisite.

I brushed my tail along the fronds of a large fern as I strode onto the stepping stone path.

*\~I haven’t spotted a dry leaf so far,\~* I noted.  *\~He maintains it meticulously.\~*

The path curved like puzzle pieces around black, ornamental boulders.  They almost looked like onyx … wait a minute.  I ran my paw along the stone, eying it closely.  Was this *real* black onyx?  I mean, it wasn’t *the* most expensive stone in Sapient Coalition space, but it wasn’t cheap either, especially polished like this.

My claw stopped at a little defect, before finding more.

*‘Amateur mistakes,’* my Dad would say.

So, it wasn’t polished by a professional.  It was pretty good work, but not perfect.  I wouldn’t have noticed if I didn’t examine it closely, or known what to look for.

*\~Did he polish it himself?\~* I wondered.

I could feel the years of care put into this place.  He seemed to favour plants and craftsmanship that were as close to black as possible.  It made sense.  He was creating an environment where he could blend in best: an eerie thought.

*\~It feels like a different world,\~* I mused.  *\~Dark, but peaceful.  I could just sit here, or walk around for a claw and never get bored.\~*

I spotted what I’d been looking for and trotted over a small bridge arched above a river.  Finally, I was under the gargua tree.  A low-hanging fruit dangled before me.  Every cycle, the town had a contest to see who could grow the biggest gargua fruit.  This one could have won, *easily.*  The weird part was that *all* its companions were as big as I’d ever seen a gargua, if not bigger.  I could fit inside some of them.

And the colours were off.

For no particular reason, I touched it, backtracking when it popped off the stem and fell.  Apparently, this one was ready for reaping.  Falling gargua fruit were a legitimate hazard for harvesters.  This gargua would go bad within a day or two.  Aside from cold storage and other preservation techniques, there was a way to trick it into thinking it was still attached to the tree, making it live longer.  However, there was no one around to do that.  It would go to waste, unless …

*\~Hmm … I wonder.\~*

Curiosity got me.  I hefted it upright and took a bite.

*\~WOW.  It tastes-!\~*

**COUGH!  HACK!**

*\~That’s a* ***really*** *strong taste.\~*

It had that sweet, gargua flavour I’d liken to a pumpkin crossed with a mango.  The problem was it had *waaay* too much of it.  I felt like I needed to wash it down with something.

Then my stomach headbutted down the door to my thought process.

*\~Leraiiiiii,\~* it bleated all sweet and singsong like.  *\~Aren’t you forgetting something?\~*

*\~Listen,\~* I began diplomatically. *\~I know you’re* ***really*** *missing first meal right about now, but it would be really weird and unprofessional for me to just chow down in the backyard of some criminal who-\~*

*\~Think of it as judo,\~* argued my stomach.

*\~… Wut?\~* I asked.

*\~The giant has probably been eating this for a long time.  He beat you.  Do you really think you can fight him, running on fumes after losing first meal?  You know the old slogan: ‘Be the strongest!  Eat Best Harvest!\~*

My ears shot up.  *\~Wait … come to think of it, is this a Best Harvest fruit?  That would explain why it’s so big, but I don’t think they ever had anything like this on the market.  I’ve had their garguas before.  What’s our giant doing with something like this?\~*

*\~The same thing you’re doing with it, I imagine,\~* quipped my stomach.

“Mmph?” I grunted through a mouthful of gargua.

Since when did I take a-?  I couldn’t tell if it was the ^(En)F.R.I.G.H.T, EnF.I.G.H.T.^(En) or just hunger, but …

*\~Shhhh … shh … sh … just let it happen,\~* whispered my stomach.

… I took another bite.

And another.

Then another.

The taste was still too rich, the flesh so dense that I had to chew a bit.  Still, it was something I could get used to.  Once I pushed past all that, knowing what to expect, it got pretty moreish.

I really hadn’t eaten that much, in my opinion, but it felt like I’d had two first meals doused in coffee.  My energy was surging back to normal and beyond.

*\~He seriously eats this all the time?\~* I wondered.  *\~That could explain why he’s so healthy, despite his size … or is he big* ***because*** *he eats this?  What would happen to me if I ate this on the regular?  I’m already grown, but Hiyla on the other paw…\~*

I pictured my not-so-little sister bowing through the doorframe, towering over Dad and I before bleating a greeting in her unfittingly, high-pitched voice.  Then, for whatever reason, she decided to hug me.  Her heavy wool took me in and I never made it back out.

“Heh … heh, heh,” I whistled.  “Sweet stars, Human humour is rubbing off on me.”

Alright, back to the case.  Surely, gargua wasn’t the only thing he ate.  Scanning around, I quickly found a handful of other fruit trees, and a small patch of field exposed to the twilight sky.  With more access to light, crops were growing.

They all looked big, and/or weird in some other way.

How did he have all this?  A theory germinated in my head.

\------------

Back inside, the first unfamiliar room I saw seemed as good as any to investigate.

I pushed through the door and found myself in some odd cross between an office and a rec room.  Big chair, big desk … it was weird to picture him settled and sitting at a table, not being violent or extra in any way.

So many posters and paraphernalia.  If I hadn’t met the guy, I might have assumed he was an actual otaku.

Where to start?  Oh, his Terran computer!  One of the best ways to read someone was to go through the devices that absorbed one fifth of their lifespan!  Even so, it felt *wrong,* like peeping at someone without any wool.

Sighing, I climbed onto his chair feeling like a pup.  To reach the top of the desk, I had to kneel.  A little, caped action figure in red and blue tights caught my eye.

“Aw, what do we have here?” I cooed, my tail smacking the back of the chair as it tried to wag.

Fist raised as though he would fly, he was one of my favourite Terran legends … besides Bruce Lee … and Rocky … and a number of fighters who were generally more realistic.

Except Mike Tyson.

My tail stopped wagging.  I touched my ear.

*\~It was just a dream,\~* I told myself for the hundredth time.

Back to the subject: the giant liked heroes.  Maybe he wasn’t all bad.  Then I spotted the glue holding the action figure together in several places.

*\~Not very encouraging.\~*

Finally, I proceeded to invade the giant’s most personal(?) belonging.

Hmm … there weren’t that many files on the desktop, except a big video with his face on it, entitled ‘WATCH THIS, YOU IDIOTS!’

With a belaboured groan, I clicked the video, and the giant Venlil appeared on the screen.  He seemed to be recording from the very chair I was kneeling in.

“Presuming you’re an exterminator trying to figure out what led to my little tantrum, this video is for you,” he began.  “If you’re not?  Well … could you leave, maybe?  If you stick around, I apologise for what you’re about to experience.”

I glanced at the door.

“Oh, you’re still here, so let’s start with the basics,” he continued, recapturing my focus.  “Hey, my name is Brkar.  It’s nice to meet you.”

He extended a paw.

A handshake mimicry?  I narrowed my eyes at his proffered paw.  Even if he were here, I’d leave him hanging just like so.  Besides, he’d probably just crush my paw and laugh.

“Yeah, good call,” Brkar chuckled, withdrawing his paw.  “If I were there, I’d probably just crush your paw and laugh … which is a really weird thought to have, come to think of it.  I wonder if something’s wrong with me?”

*“What was your first hint?”* I deadpanned.

“So anyway, I’m sure you’re wondering who I am, how I managed to fly under the radar for so long, and why I’ve probably torn through you guys at this stage,” he supposed.  He snapped his digits.  “I know! I give you a manifesto!  Would that help?”

My ears angled forwards.

“Well, you’re not gonna get it,” he grinned.  “You don’t deserve it.  So basically, I just wasted …” he glanced to his top right “… thirty-seven seconds of your life, and counting.  Time is precious, and you’re never gonna get it back.  Think of all the things you could have done if you weren’t stuck here, burning braincells, hoping to glean *something* useful out of this video.  You could have met that special someone in a once-in-a-lifetime encounter.  You could be having second meal.  You could be saving *actual lives …* wait, am I the bad guy?”

***“What was your first hint!?”*** I brayed.

“So anyway, goodbye.  I hate you, and I hope we never see each other again!” he concluded.

The screen went black.

…

*\~Was that it?  I thought this video barely chipped the progress bar … wait, I was right, so either the rest was is all dead space, or-\~*

Suddenly, the video was back.

# “BAH!”

He’d bleated.  At the top of his lungs.  Closeup.  Jump scare.

**“BAH!?”** I bleated back, startled out of my wool.

He laughed, pointed at me and, shook the table as he slapped it.

“Sweet stars, this man-pup is testing my patience,” I groaned.

**“You thought I was gone, didn’t you?”** he roared.  **“HA!  Look at your face!  Just** ***look*** **at it!  You look** ***so stupid!”***

“I’m going to headbutt the computer,” I mumbled.

He went serious.  “Please don’t do that.”

*Okayyyy.*  That was creepy.  Did he actually …?

“Yeah.  I see you,” he smirked.

Oh brahk.

Was this live?  Forcing myself to remain calm, I reached out to see if I could pause the video.  He burst into another bout of laughter before I could.

**“You Feddie brats spook so easy!”** he brayed.  **“You really think I can** ***see*** **you?  BAHAHAA!”**

I found myself lining up a headbutt.

**“How could I see you?  I’m sitting in the chair** ***you’re*** **sitting in!”** he blurted.  **“I kept it around** ***specifically*** **for that purpose, and believe me** … that chair has gone through things.”

Looking down at the weathered upholstery, I wondered if I should be glad or disturbed that I didn’t have a nose.

“Look, I know you wanna meekly stomp out that door and do something productive,” he reasoned.  “However, I am the PD mastermind who just stormed through your ranks.  What if there are more of me?  What if I have plans that keep going even when I’m done?  You’re gonna have to dissect every ^(En)second^(En) of this, hoping that I’d say or do something worth noting.“

He was right.  I had to watch this through.

\------------

*23 minutes of wasted time later …*

\------------

**“I can’t believe you’re still watching this** ^(En)**bra’a’ainrot**^(En)**!”  HAHA!  Look at you!**  ***Get a life,*** **you SAD,** ***SAD PERSON!”*** Brkar laughed with a mouthful of some brownish snack I couldn’t identify.

The table now had a dent shaped like my forehead after I’d steadily started taking out my frustrations.  If *this* was what Lmur was going through, I almost wished he’d put the Yotul out of his misery.

“Wait, lemme cheer you up!” he guffawed as he shoved the plastic bag at me.  “How ‘bout a snack?  You like beef jerky?  If you stuff it inside a slice of gargua fruit …” he demonstrated the abomination “… it becomes somewhat more palatable!  Okay, I’m lying.  It tastes good either way.  I just wanted to desecrate this gargua right in front of you.  Sorry not sorry.”

Okay.  This was abuse, plain and simple.

Something snapped.  It was then when I crawled onto the table, grabbed the monitor, pulled back my head and-

Wait, ***beef jerky?*** **He could** ***eat*** **that stuff??**  **Was that even** ***possible!?***

I abandoned my destructive pursuits to scrutinise the giant on the screen.

Brkar stared at his packet of forbidden snacks in disappointment.  “I guess you’re more confused than anything else at this stage.  Too bad.  I was enjoying your discomfort.”

It was a small victory, but him breaking his own harassment streak gave me a little taste of satisfaction that- hang on, did I just smirk?  I felt my facial muscles *do* something.  Venlil could learn how, but it wasn’t particularly easy.  I would have assumed I’d done something else, but I’m pretty sure I saw my reflection in the display.  Smirking.

I’d been spending too much time around Humans.

He picked up the little action figure in red and blue, gazing upon it with a contemplative eye.

“I guess this brings us back to who I am, where I come from and how I managed to live here without a single PD screening,” Brkar mused.  “Truth to be told, I wasn’t born on this planet.  I wasn’t born on any planet, actually …”

I craned my neck to look up.  Gazing back down at me was our gas giant, Elder Brother.  It was a sea of ebony, churning with winding white storms and hypersonic wind flows that glowed.  From what I’d been told, the planet’s atmosphere had a phosphorescent quality that emitted light when agitated.   It looked like an onyx lava lamp.  I’d been told that it’s gravitational field protected Venlil Prime from meteor threats.  It had stopped 3 potentially extinction-level asteroids, apparently.

The great and mighty Elder Brother relegated to looming above the concave diamondine ceiling like a glorified chandelier!  It was little more than a showpiece

“You and me both, buddy,” I sighed.

We Venlil didn’t generally wear clothes.  Those were for people with fur issues, and snobby high society parties.  Best Feast was about to begin, and *apparently* it qualified as the latter, but *why was I even here??*  All that secrecy, and now they paraded me out like a circus freak in a silly costume?  The large, red cloth felt weird around my waist.  How did they get me into this thing again?

\---

*“P-please calm down, Mr. Brkar!” mewled the tailor.*

*“I am NOT wearing this thing!  It looks like a skirt!” I brayed.*

*He tilted his head.  “What’s a skirt?”*

*Oh, right.  Most Venlil didn’t have the context.*

*“I-it’ll help the guests know that you’re friendly!” the tailor had stammered.*

*“I’m FRIENDLY??” I’d bleated in genuine confusion.  “Also since when were people supposed to know ANYTHING about me?”*

*“Please!” he mewled.  “I’m merely following your dad’s wishes!”*

*“Then unfollow!  Just GHOST them!” I demanded.  “I barely know the guy …”*

*“HE’S BEEN IN YOUR LIFE SINCE THE DAY OF YOUR BIRTH!” the tailor finally exploded.*

*I smirked.  This guy had bark, at least.*

*“Precisely. I’ve only been here for seven cycles, so yes: I barely know the guy.”*

*“It looks like a toga, crossed with a loincloth,” Mom interjected.  “Very manly.”*

*I eyed her for several scratches.  She was just about the gutsiest Venlil I knew.  If she wasn’t outright lying to my face, her opinions were usually pretty based when I cooled down enough to listen to her.  She didn’t seem* *to be lying.*

*I surrendered with a pouty sigh.  “Alright, Mr. Dressmaker.  Do your worst.”*

\---

Right.  Mom.  She did this to me, and I let her.  If I *really* thought about it, it *did* look sort of like loincloth crossed with a toga, which was … kinda cool?

**Who was I kidding?  I was wearing a** ***SKIRT!***

“So, who’s your favourite?” a pup bleated furtively.

How strange.  I recognised him as ‘Cousin Ryvel’, who I’d never met. I recognised other relatives among him and the little herd too.  I hadn’t met them either, yet they walked right up to me.  Other Venlil usually steered clear, especially the pups, but they had a different vibe.  They all carried themselves with a resting confidence I’d seldom seen, except for my inner circle.  On second look, it wasn’t confidence per se.  They were just chill.  Stable.  I spotted a few nerves, but I felt the same way.  It was that ubiquitous fear among pups meeting someone for the first time, summed up into two bleats: *‘I hope they like me.  I hope we can be friends.’*

I opened my mouth.

He raised a tail.  “Wait.  Say it without saying it.  ^(The grownups hate when we talk about this stuff.”)

I stared down at him in question.  I was taller than most of the adults, but this pup was probably older than me.  Ten cycles, maybe eleven.  No one would know I was the younger between us unless they fished that info out of someone.  Heh, ‘fished’.  Most Venlil did *not* wanna hear the thoughts that ran through my head.  I wondered what this pup might think of stuff like that.  Come to think of it, I didn’t even know what he was talking about.

“What exactly are you asking?” I queried.

He bared his teeth in that friendly way that’d get him screened for PD anywhere else.  My ears perked up.  Mom told me not to grin at people … *yet,* but if he was grinning first?  I figured it was cool.  *More* than cool.  I grinned back.  Okay, if that was the kind of conversation we were having?  I was totally down for it.

“Alright, I’ll go first,” he declared, before holding up his paw in a strange position.

I stared at it.  Was that an ‘I love you sign’, or …?

He added a sound effect, pressing his palm with a middle digit.  *“Thwip! Thwip!”*

My eyes lit up.  “That’s some great power ya got there.”

“Ah, you know him!” whistled the boy.  “All the others just run, or jump, or fly.  He moves so differently, and it looks *sooo* cool.”

“His mask is a little creepy,” commented a girl.  “I’d have made the eye-parts a more rounded at least, so it’s easier to tell he’s a ‘friendly neighbourhood’ guy.”

I wagged my tail.  Were we *all* on the same wavelength?  This was great!

“Yeah,” agreed the boy, “but then you hear him tell jokes and see him being all nice and stuff!  After everything that happened to him, he should be really upset, like, *all the time,* but he always gets back up. Keeps telling jokes and being a good guy.  He’s not scary.  He’s *wicked awesome!*” 

I whistled at the combination of words.

“So, what about you guys?  Who’s your favourite?” the boy probed.

I removed the over-glorified red cloth around my waist and tied it to the back of my neck.  Only *now* was it worthy of glory.  If we had a little wind around here, this would be *perfect.*  The cloth draped behind me as I threw my fist to the air like I’d fly all the way to Eldest.

“Take a guess,” I grinned.

Some nodded in approval.

The girl scoffed.  “Stereotypical choice.”

I turned to her, my expression level.  *“Are you sure?”*

Her eyes flicked back to my red cape and she gasped.  “Wait, you like *THAT* guy?  You mother had you watch *that?”*

I was surprised she unraveled the reference so easily

“No, obviously,” I parried.  “I saw a couple memes before she updated the filter algorithm.  Everyone’s first guess was correct.  It not him, I’d go with …”

I made a ring over my head with my tail and hummed what sounded like an ancient hymn.

They didn’t seem to get it, except perhaps the girl.  She frowned at me.  I supposed my tail-halo wasn't all that great.

I lowered my voice, all stoic and gravelly.  *“I need a weapon,”* I quoted.

Ear flicks of realisation fluttered through the bunch as it clicked.

The girl rolled her eyes.  “But your mother had you play *that* one, though.  Nice.”

She was starting to bug me.  “Again, no, but I read about it.  One species, fighting countless others who think they shouldn’t exist?  A big, strong guy everyone expects to get the job done?  It hits.  Let me put it that way.”

“So, she let that slip through the cracks of your little ‘algorithm’,” the girl jeered.  “Some mother.”

“Hey, would you drop it?” I snapped.  “If anything, *I* slipped through the cracks.  Managing me is a full-time job.  I don’t make it easy, but my mom is as good and strong as they come.  You don’t know her.”

“The quality of a pup reflects the merit of a mother,” she derided.  “I know her, because I’ve seen you, and frankly I’m not impressed.“

I stepped in front of her, my shadow looming.  She went quiet.  I could see her coming to grips with just how tall I really was.

“Apologise,” was my demand.

The girl hooked her tail around a chair behind her.  With a tug, she pivoted it to her side on one of its feet.  That … had to be a fluke.  No way she could coordinate a trick like that on purpose.

Without breaking eye contact, she smoothly raised herself off the ground with her large tail to stand on top of it.  Oh, I see.  She wanted to stare me down at eye level.  Unfortunately for her, I was *still* a little taller.

Then she stared.  With both eyes.

I realised her skull was shaped so that she could manage binocular vision a bit better than the norm.  Her muzzle was small and stubby, keeping it out of the way.  The rest of her head was somewhat large for her body, but she made up for that with a long and apparently strong tail.

*\~What a peculiar Venlil,\~* I thought.

The strangeness didn’t stop there.  Her stare was intense, focused.  Not angry or anything, but I felt like it was trying to penetrate my wool and drink out everything there was to know about me.  The pupils had dilated from rounded rectangles to ovals.  Her unusually large ears spread even wider to face me.

“What are you trying to do?” I asked.

She didn’t answer.  The blank yet hyper-focused stare persisted.  It was almost creepy, but not quite.  Wait a scratch …

I whistled a laugh.  “Are you trying to *scare* me?”

Her eyes faltered just a little.  I had her pegged, and she knew it.  Her ears angled down to my heart.  Why?  Was she trying to hear my breathing?  Why?  *Ahhh,* that’s right. Breathing was a good indicator of fear, which could tell her if I was lying.

I wasn’t.

Leisurely, I leant my elbows against the chair’s back, bringing our muzzles a pelt’s distance apart.  She took an emotionless little step back, keeping some space between us.  As I suspected!  *She* was just a little Venlil trying to act tough!

So, why was she acting tough?  I thought back to what she said.  My ears shot up.  She didn’t ask if my mom *let* me watch it, or play the game.  She asked if my mom *had* me watch it.  As in, *against my will.*

“You’re not being a random brat,” I realised.  “You just have a problem with mothers.  *Period.”*

Her armour chipped away.  She began to tremble.

“What did your mom do to you?” I queried.

***“Ssssssk’a’a!”*** she hissed.

*Whoa.*

I didn’t know a Venlil could make that sound.  Coming out of her, it felt more like a cute kitten trying to be scary, but it raised my hackles, just a little.  It made me want to … *fight?*  How strange.

**“My mother is a ball of** ***speh!”*** she spat.  **“She** ***knew*** **what she was getting when I was born, and she** ***still*** **acted like I did something wrong for being what I am!  In the name of ‘orientation’, she exposes me to** ***ANY*** **media,** ***ANY*** **history,** ***ANY*** **current affairs, and there is no filter!  She stuffs my brain until it throws up, and that’s just the tip of the tail!  Do you have** ***ANY*** **idea what that’s like!?”**

I sighed.  Poor pup.  “No.  I don’t.  I can imagine, but I still won’t know.  Have you figured out why your mom does that to you?  Have you tried to change her mind?”

She finally broke.  Tears streaked down her stiff face as she tried to maintain her expression.  Only the eye facing away from the others was weeping.  How curious …

The pup leant a little closer.  Her keen was a whisper.  It felt like she was trying to bray it all out, but wouldn’t.  From a distance, it might have looked like she was threatening me up close and personal.  Perhaps that was how she wanted it to seem.

^(“Of course I know,”) she lamented.  ^(“I’m the smartest Venlil in the room. EVERY)*^(.)* ^(ROOM.  My dad) *^(convinced)* ^(her to have me.  She was the only one he found who could do it, and he gave her no little choice.  I know all the whys, the hows and the whats. I’ve tried, and) *^(I’ve tried,)* \*\*\*^(and I’VE TRIED)\*\*\***^(.)**  ^(I can see) ^(the moments when I) *^(almost)* ^(change her mind, but then she changes it back! She doesn’t) *^(WANT)* ^(to like me.  She doesn’t want) \*^(ME.  A pup… shouldn’t have to c-convince … her mother … that she’s worth WANTING!)\*^(”)

I didn’t really care if she was trying to make her confession look threatening to save face.  I stepped around the chair back, put a paw to her shoulders, and pulled her into a hug.  Face buried in my wool, she made a half-hearted attempt to push me away.

^(“Don’t fight it,”) I whispered.  ^(“They can’t see your face.  Just let it out.”)

After a few scratches, her arms hung as she gave up.  I felt little sobs rack her body.

^(“What is even happening right now?”) I heard the Ryvel whisper.

^(“Never seen a Venil assert dominance through hugging!”) guffawed another.

I listened with one ear, the other one angled down to the weeping pup.

^(“If you can’t make her like you, then find someone else who does, or like yourself to the point where that doesn’t matter,”) I suggested quietly.  ^(“Also, stop being mean and trying to scare people.  You’re too cute to pull it off.”)

She froze … then rubbed her face in my wool and pushed herself away to look at my eyes.  I let her do it this time.  Her ears scanned my torso, focusing on one spot, then two, then one again.  What was she listening for this time?

Wait, could she hear my heartbeat too?  Was she trying to be some kind of lie detector?

Finally, the pup pointed a claw to herself.  Her voice was so low that I could barely hear her, let alone anyone else.

^(“I’m c-cute?”)

Was it really that hard to believe?

My ears twitched amusement as I patted her on the head.  She pouted, but didn’t stop me.

Ryvel squinted between us.  “How old are you two?  I’ve been trying to figure that out.  You don’t really talk or act like pups.

“Seven cycles,” I answered simply.

“… Eight cycles, thirty four pa- actually, never mind.  Let's leave it at eight cycles,” she amended.

Wait, what?  I thought she was a precocious five, tops.  Whatever growth she’d managed must have gone to her ears, tail and head.  Hm.  *Head.*  I think she *almost* gave us her precise age, then bailed on it.  I wondered if she could go down to the exact claws.

Ryvel’s jaw almost hit the ground.  “Really?  I’m eleven.  I’m a *tall* eleven.  What does that make you, *huh?*”

The girl swung her tail and body, pivoting the chair on a leg so that it ended up right in front of him.  Now, she towered over R.

“We are Clever Venlil,” she smirked, leaning on the back in the same, laidback manner I did.

Ryvel back.

She turned her ears towards me.  “See?  I can pull it off.”

Okay.  Maybe she *could* be a tad intimidating, and she pulled her chair trick more than once.  Either she’d practiced this weirdly specific feat, or she had some kind of talent.  Interesting, how she’d lumped me under the title of clever Venlil.  Hold on a scratch, did she mean *clever* Venlil, or *Clever* Venlil?  The emphasis was key.  I knew I was a Strong Venlil, but I’d never heard about Clever Venlil.

Who *was* this girl?

“O-okay,” stammered the boy, shaking off the heebie-jeebies.

“I guess we’re just early blooms,” I chuckled in whistle, then tried to change the subject.  “I’m Brkar, by the way.  Who are you guys?”

“Rebra,” the girl offered a little too quickly, like she was trying to beat everyone else to it.

Ryvel glared at me.  “I know who you are.  I’m Ryvel, but I think you know that too!  Early bloom my tail!  Bro, you’re *built like a Takkan!”*

“Of course I am.  I eat Best Harvest,” I declared with the confident tail-flourish of an actor in a commercial.  “Every day, every meal.”

I caught her discreetly pulling a small pad out of her wool.  She typed up a message *really* fast, but I glimpsed enough.

*‘-prepare a Best Harvest meal plan for the next cycle.  Further details-’*

She sent the message and tucked it away, glaring at me for staring.

I held back a whistle.  She was trying to grow bigger?  That was *irredeemably adorable!*  There was no walking back on this!

“Cut the speh!  I’m a Best Harvest too!” Ryvel brayed.  “I eat our stuff often enough!”

“Maybe that’s why you’re a *little* taller,” I supposed mischievously.

He strode up to me.  “Maybe.  You’re big, but I bet you’re not too fast.”

What was he-?

His tap was light, quick, and he ran off just as quickly.  **“Tag!  You’re it!”**

Everyone scattered.

I looked at Rebra.

She looked at me, ears falling, eyes growing bigger.  “W-wait!  You wouldn’t tag a little lady in such a disadvantageous position, would you?”

I snorted.  “You’re not that cute. I’m giving you five scratches.”

She dove off the chair, landing in a weirdly smooth roll that brought her back to her feet in an instant.  Her run had that same, smooth quality, but aside from her impressive motor skills, she was only *kinda* fast for her size.  Almost fast enough to keep up with Ryvel.

In other words, they were all slow as speh.

Whistling, I swept the cape clear behind me, desperately wishing a wind would miraculously blow through so it would billow majestically.  Oh well.  It looked cool enough already.

I lowered myself into a start position.

***“Faster than a speeding bullet!”*** I brayed.

I took off.

**“SWEET STARS!  HE’S ACTUALLY** ***FAST!”*** someone brayed.

That revelation brought sweet, squealing bleats from their muzzles as I closed in.

According to the progress bar, Brkar had been staring at the caped action figure for about a minute, refusing to elaborate.  I waited with bated breath, hoping he would tell me *something* about his past beyond being born on a space station, or a moon, I could only presume.

Finally, the action figure snapped in Brkar’s grip.

He slowly shifted an unimpressed eye down to the fallen torso on the counter, while humming [a tune I didn’t recognise.](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxVOb1_0Iw98fYZw6aa7VA5XAc5bTMWO18?si=EiLykDUWV1rjlBDm)

“So, anyway, that’s it,” he concluded.  “Run along and exterminate some innocent souls.  It won’t change what happened, or what I did to you.”

I checked the progress bar again.  He was lying.  There was still more to go, but he was just staring me down as though I were a blob of speh.

“But we’re *changing.*  Can’t you see that?*”* I implored.  “I joined the exterminators *because* they were changing.  I wanted to help them make the change even faster.”

His fist pounded the table, making the screen shake.  **“DON'T** ***look at me*** **like that!  I’m not some** **^(En)****rando’o****^(En)** **monster who crawled out of the woodworks!  I am a monument of your sins!  Your yesterday,** **come back to bite you in the tail!  I don’t** ***CARE*** **if you’re changing, okay??  You can’t just** ***ruin lives*** **and bleat:** *‘Oh!*  That was the old me!  *Oh!* It was a different time!  Oh, ***please*** stop!  I don’t deserve this anymooore!’ Well, guess what?  I’m not gonna stop until I’m good and ready. Y’know, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction,” Brkar stated.  “I could give it to you, *OHHH* yeah, I could give it to you.  Tear up your guilds, root by root, but I’m not gonna do that.”  He sighed heavily.  “More than anything, I just want to see my family again.  I want to see my friends.  I know you have families, and friends, so I’m not gonna go all the way.  With my own paws, I’ll reap your fear, your despair. I’ll drink myself drunk upon your tears.  Just for a little while.  After that?  You get to walk away, live out the rest of your days.  I don’t.  Does that sound fair?  I dunno.  I think you’re getting the better deal.”

Was he planning to go to prison or something?

He shrugged.  “Okay, maybe you won’t walk away, or be able to walk ever again.  Maybe you won’t be breathing anymore either.  Depends on how well you can take a hit, but whatever … when this is over, you’ll find me on Star Whisper Hill.  I’m gonna just lie there and look up at the sky, until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore.  I’ll go to sleep, and that will be it … Don’t worry.  I won’t wake up.”

I felt the blood chill in my veins.

He massaged his forehead.  “Look, just … try to pick up the body before it traumatises some poor pup, okay?”

I’d barely caught the last few words.  By then, I was halfway out the room.

Eyes and ears, shocked and fearful, turned on me as I stormed out the front door.

*\~What to do?  What do I do!?\~* I bleated inwardly.  *\~Squad van?  No, I can’t ask anyone to drive me.  He’ll just beat them up!”*

“Lerai?  What’s wrong?” asked Maydee.

**“I gotta go!”** I bleated.  **“It’s- I just** ***gotta go!***  **Don’t look for me!”**

**--------------**

**Transcription transposition: Maydee, Zurulian Flame**

**--------------**

Then she just ran off without a word.

I turned my eye upon the house.  She’d seen something in there.  What could spook her like that?

\---

After searching around the home a little, I found *that* video and ran it from the beginning.  Apparently, she hadn’t finished it.  The video auto-paused when the camera detected no one watching.

“It occurs to me that someone might find this video before I’m gone,” Brkar supposed.  “If you find me on Star Whisper, just stay in the shadows like the cowards you are.  Watch from afar, if you wanna make sure I don’t cause any trouble.  If you wanna start something, we’re gonna have a little more fun.  There’s nothing short of a flamethrower that can take me down.”

My ear gave a slow flick.  Flamethrower?  Bad choice of words.  He’d get one. I had a hunch she’d warm his soul, or burn his paws if he got rowdy.

Either way, Lerai was closing in.

* Save, load, export, and import your creations
* Get an estimated cost for your builds

I have a few interesting ideas in the works, but I think it's in a good enough state to share with everyone.

Please feel free to try it out, and let me know if you run into any bugs! I’ve done my best to iron them out, but I’m sure I managed to let some slip through.

1jy8nss,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAllinPodcasts/comments/1jy8nss/intellectually_honest_review_of_the_great_tariff/,Intellectually honest review of the Great Tariff Debate,"I see a lot of people saying Sacks lost his cool, that the besties had to use ChatGPT to answer Summers' questions or that they could not provide any metrics to measure the efficacy of the tariff policies. 

These takes lack charitability and frankly, intellectual honestly. I am going to preface this by saying I am not a Trump supporter. I voted Biden in 20 and Harrris in 24. Trump has upended the liberal economic order by bullying nations to come to the negotiating table. American allies have lost faith and trust in the US due to Trump's actions. 

That being said, let's evaluate what Trump is going for and how that stems from what he believes. He believes American trading partners are ripping the US off. It's not because there is a trade deficit with China, for example, that China is ripping the US off. It's because China's had trade barriers the restrict the flow of goods into China. They have industrial policy that makes it possible for them to dump cheap goods at a loss. While China entering the WTO has made it so that they have to follow rules, the concessions they've made is not fair. 

American companies like Facebook and Google cannot enter the Chinese market. Foreign Investors and Manufacturers need a local partner with a sizeable share to start factories in China. China's long been protectionist and this has allowed them to accumulate dollars by selling cheap goods to the US. That's great for consumers because they can buy cheap goods, but bad for producers because they do not get even access to the Chinese markets.

China's entrance into the WTO has made it so that both the US and China benefit. In the counterfactual where China never entered the WTO and had significant trade barriers, it is my belief that the world would be poor with American consumers not being able to consume as they want. But China would also violate IP laws more flagrantly. 

China's accumulation of dollars has allowed them to lend dollars to the American government and governments over the world to a point where they are able to collect interest off American tax payers. 

China's the most flagrant example of trade barriers but many nations have protectionist policies that limit the flow of American goods. 

Trump has sought to remedy this. His approach is crass and can be analogized to taking a sledgehammer to tighten a screw. It's yet to be seen whether Trump will reduce the trade deficit, either by gaining concessions from China in them reducing trade barriers or by limiting trade between the two nations due to uncompetitive tariff rates. 

  The game theory in this game of chicken Trump is playing suggests that the ideal outcome for both is reduced tariffs. China does not want to concede here because it would mean they are worse off than they currently are. It means more American goods can flow into China. Due to comparative advantage, it may still be the case that in the post trade war world, trade deficits still exist, but it is also true that the deficits will decrease by virtue of the fact that America would have freer access to trade across the globe.

Now, the way Trump has approached his problem is problematic. Instead of surgically tacking tariffs and negotiating with individual countries to get a fairer deal, Trump's posturing and haphazard actions have meant that foreign investors are not only withdrawing from US equities but also treasuries. 

The post trade war world is one where the size of the US economy is noticeably diminished with fewer foreign investors buying treasuries and fewer trading partners willing to trade with the US. It also mean, though, that the US has a fairer trade balance with the world, despite it not being 1:1. 

It's not true to say that you have a trade deficit with the cafe next door. The more apt analogy would be that the cafe is willing to sell you coffee but when you seek employment, they refuse to hire you. 

That being said, the answer to Ezra Klein's question about metric is simple. In 2 years, 5 years, 10 years, how does the trade balance look like with every country in the world? Has the deficit gone down? My hypothesis is that it will go down. However, will the US economy contract significantly? Yes. Trump made the call that this was a worthwhile trade-off. That argument is still on the table. Perhaps, if he had started the negotiations more strategically and with surgical precision, the US could reduce the deficit it has with the world without damaging its own economy as much.

1jy8n3m,https://www.reddit.com/r/rejectiontherapy/comments/1jy8n3m/the_only_way_to_face_social_anxietyshyness_forever/,The only way to face Social anxiety/shyness forever,"# How to face anxiety /shyness

Most social anxiety comes from living a sheltered life, lacking real-world social experience, and overthinking what others think of you and Trauma. The solution isn’t endless analysis — it’s exposure. Get out there. Force yourself into social interactions. Learn by doing.

**THE ONLY SUSTAINABLE FIX TO SHYNESS SOCIAL ANXIETY IS EXPOSURE THERAPY**

**Even professional therapists use Exposure Therapy, along with trauma healing and possibly medication to lower cortisol. Fun fact: the practices done additionally to Exposure Therapy can also be done on your own, for free, as outlined at the end.**

**What is Exposure Therapy?**

Exposure therapy is a psychological treatment specifically designed to help individuals confront and reduce their fear or anxiety by gradually and repeatedly exposing them to the feared object or situation in a controlled way

**In our case :** In its simplest form, Exposure Therapy is about putting yourself out there, engaging with others, and learning to handle rejection.

To fully experience its benefits, especially in extreme cases of social anxiety, you need to confront what you're most afraid of. This could mean talking to the most attractive person in the room, asking for something seemingly ridiculous, being assertive or obnoxious, or even complaining about something you dislike. The key is to push yourself to do something uncomfortable until you become comfortable with it.

Once you're no longer afraid of rejection, you don't have to keep making a fool of yourself—just start approaching people you like, making new friends, being social and liked, and living life the way you want, without fear and being normal and amkign others feel good .

The fastest and best way to ensure consistent Exposure is by getting a social job in retail or sales, which effectively pays you for facing social anxiety. These jobs especially in sales, also provide additional tactics to charm people and, of course, hold you accountable.

Other possibilities include joining a sports club for consistent exposure and accountability, or having a social friend who teaches you and invites you out to help hold you accountable.

**The goal** is to no longer let the fear of rejection control you, which means no longer changing yourself to please others, not avoiding things you genuinely want to do out of fear, and no longer isolating yourself to avoid feeling awkward or risking embarrassment. It’s about being okay with rejection, making others feel good, and  not letting others opinions determine your self worth 

Caveat: If you have extreme social anxiety to the point where it makes you awkward and extremely weird

When you're starting out, do this in an environment where mistakes won't damage your reputation (not work,school….)—preferably one that's low-risk until you're socially calibrated and skilled.

**How to start**

Go outside your house and talk to people—make requests, express how you feel, and do everything you normally want to do but hold back from because of fear of rejection. This might mean saying hi,complementing, introducing yourself to someone you like, asking a girl for her number or directions, or requesting a favor. It could also include organizing something and asking others if they want to join, or asking if you can join in on something. It might even mean speaking up for yourself or for others.

**Saying hi to someone you like** – Walking up to a classmate or coworker and simply saying, ""Hey, I’ve seen you around. I’m \[Your Name\]. How’s it going?""

**Asking a girl for her number** – If you’re chatting with someone and feeling a connection, you might say, ""Hey, I’ve really enjoyed talking to you. Would you like to hang out sometime? Maybe we could exchange numbers?""

**Asking for directions** – If you're in a new area and unsure where a specific place is, ask someone nearby: ""Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to \[place\]?""

**Requesting a favor** – If you’re at a coffee shop and need a bit of help, you could ask: ""Hey, could you please give me a hand with carrying these to the table?""

**Organizing something and inviting others** – If you’re planning to go to a movie, you might say, ""I’m going to see \[Movie Name\] this weekend. Anyone want to join me?""

**Asking to join something** – If you see a group playing basketball or hanging out, you could approach and ask, ""Hey, is it cool if I join you guys for a game?""

**Speaking up for yourself or others** – If someone says something rude or unfair, you can step in: ""I don’t think that’s right. Can we talk about it?"" Or, if a friend is being left out, you could say, ""Why don’t you come with us?""

**Complimenting someone’s appearance** – If someone is dressed well, you could say, “I really like your style; that jacket looks great on you!”

**Complimenting someone’s personality or actions** – If a friend does something kind or thoughtful, you might say, “You’re always so considerate. I really admire that about you.”

**Complimenting someone’s skills or talent** – If someone does something impressive, you could say, “That was an amazing presentation! You really know how to engage the audience.”

**Complimenting someone’s effort or work** – If a colleague or classmate puts in extra effort, you could say, “I can see you worked hard on this project. Great job!”

**Complimenting someone’s energy or vibe** – If someone is particularly upbeat or has a positive energy, you could say, “I love the energy you bring to the room. It’s contagious!”

**Complimenting someone’s mindset or values** – If someone shares a thoughtful perspective, you might say, “I really appreciate how you see things. It’s refreshing to hear someone with such a positive and grounded outlook.”

Baby-step your way into action. If going direct feels like too much, start small. Say hi. Make a comment. Request something and be ok with no..Just get the ball rolling.

As you expose yourself to new people and situations, **reality-check your fears**. Prove your brain wrong. Most of your fears won’t come true. And if they do, they’re rarely as catastrophic as your mind imagines. But this kind of reality-checking only works if you actually take risks and **don’t rely on safety behaviors** Since they reduce the effectiveness of this practice.

**Examples of safety behaviors:**

* Avoiding eye contact
* Only speaking when spoken to
* Rehearsing lines mentally instead of being present
* Staying quiet to avoid potential embarrassment

Ditch those. Go in raw. Feel the discomfort. Reality-check the experience and your catastrophic thoughts : worst case scenario most likely wont even happen and even if it’s probably not that bad Embrace the feedback and learn.

**When exposure therapy rejection desensitization there's one huge caveat**  :the goal isn’t to become completely desensitized to rejection or to stop caring what people think altogether. That leads to northing:the gaol is not to  be  numb to rejection and keep being rejected since you no longer care its to learn from feedback and mistakes and improve to get less rejected 

Don’t seek rejection to be desensitized and no longer give any fuck at all. That’s not strength — that’s avoidance in disguise. The point isn’t to become someone who “doesn’t give a fuck” about others. You want to no longer be afraid of rejection not actively seek being rejected 

— rather, fix the underlying issue of why you’re being rejected: looks, social skills nad not being accepted since thats what you actually want 

 Even if rejection therapy makes you more comfortable being rejected, this definitely doesn't mean people will be comfortable around you. It just makes you desensitized to how other people feel about you.Your goal isn’t just to seek  rejection but acceptance/valdiotn while not deping or changing entrially for it 

your goal is to make others comfortable and feel good while not giving a fuck at all about being rejcted hwile trying to make others feel good and **while still staying true to yourself**.

the main goal is Strive for acceptance. Therapy is to seek external validation, which is good — as long as you don’t need it to feel okay.

 It’s not “bad” to want to be liked. It feels naturally good to have external validation since that signals you’re making others feel good, which is a good thing — so The advice to “not seek external validation at all” is flawed since in others word its saying don't care about making others feel good .

.It’s not wrong to enjoy validation — it becomes a problem only when you **need** it to feel okay

or  change your opinions or whole personality /values  just to be liked or validated. Don’t change for others every time and to an extreme.

That’s not good. The goal is to prefer validation and make others comfortable and feel good through the validation you get by doing that, while not depending on it to feel okay — in other terms, not basing your self-worth on the opinions of others.

**in summary** 

**Your goal with rejection therapy isn’t to become numb or be obnoxious and stop caring about how others feel — it’s to stop letting the fear of rejection control you.**

You want to become someone who prefers being liked and making others feel good, but who’s also okay when that doesn’t happen.

Exposure or rejection therapy should help you face the fear of rejection, learn from it, and fix what’s fixable (like your communication, vibe, or looks) in order to be better accepted. Don’t chase rejection just to prove you “don’t care” — that’s avoidance in disguise.

Enjoy validation when it comes — it’s a sign you’re doing something right socially. Just don’t depend on it or change your whole self (personality, integrity, values, or preferences) to get it.

**In short:** Be your ideal self(If being yourself means being an unkind, arrogant, ignorant asshole, then obviously not) Prefer acceptance. Learn from rejection. But don’t let any of it define your worth.

***Others Yourself Tips to Make Your Progression Faster***

Use **negative visualization** — imagining worst-case scenarios — and still being okay. Then go do the thing anyway. There’s no way around it.

* **""Fake it till you make it,""** although some might argue this has the underlying premise that you never had confidence to start with and need to fake it. A better mindset is thinking that being awkward is you faking it, and being comfortable/confident is normal—you just forget how to be it. So, instead of ""fake it till you make it,"" rephrase it to: *Be confident and real until you remember.* Either way, be/pretend to be confident, no matter how you think of it, if it’s something you’ve forgotten how to do or currently don’t have.
* **Act like you belong.** Pretend you’re not uncomfortable. Fake/remember confidence until you build real skill. Through sheer willpower and repetition, you'll get better. Yes, you'll mess it up. Some people will think you're weird or dumb. So fucking what? You're going to die one day. Do you really want to be lying on your deathbed thinking, *""Wow, I wasted years avoiding eye contact because someone might judge me?""*

To lower cortisol, instead of relying on medication or alcohol—both expensive and unsustainable—use meditation

***Effective Breathing Methods:***

* Breathing techniques(**Meditation**) help reduce anxiety and relax the body by activating the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) and lowering cortisol levels.
* **Box Breathing:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds, exhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4 seconds.
* **4-7-8 Technique:** Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds (focus on diaphragmatic breathing).
* While doing this, focus on the sensation of breathing, for example, air flowing through the nose and not on any other thoughts that come up. If other thoughts do come up, just refocus on the sensation of breathing again, and do this for a longer time, at least 5 minutes.

**Human Connection: An Alternative to an Therapist for Trauma Healing**

* Talking with others (friends family) stabilizes emotions and provides new perspectives.
* Conversations help realize that anxieties are often overblown or less significant than they seem.
* Sharing emotions with others allows for rational analysis, reducing their intensity and feeling better.

***Mindset Shift:***

* **You have nothing to lose.** Afraid of losing a relationship you never even had?
* **Rejection won’t kill you anymore.** You’ll live, adapt, and find new tribes. Not everyone has to accept you. The only rejection is rejecting yourself by not asking.
* **Failure and rejection** are opportunities for growth through feedback and desensitization to fear. *Better a minute of discomfort than a lifetime of loneliness and regret.*
* **Rather be loved and hated** by many for being your ideal self than simply liked or, worse, accepted by everyone.
* **Not everyone has to like you**, just as you don’t like everyone, and that’s completely okay. This applies to every person on this earth.
* **Rather be rejected and know you fucking went for it**, basing your self-esteem on WILLPOWER and acting according to your desires.
* **You won’t take advice from an asshole,** so don’t take criticism from them either.
* **Everything you’ve ever wanted in life** is on the other side of fear.",2,1744553773.0,rejectiontherapy,0,1.0,False
1jy8m6m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jy8m6m,My Workout and Nutrition Routine,"Got a comment asking for the routine so figured I’d post and maybe this can become a fitness or lifting thread. 

Before I start, my goal was to build muscle and look big and defined not overall ‘health.’ I have a physical job that requires strength and endurance but ultimately I cared about the look. 

Most important thing is nutrition, so here’s my usual plan for the week: 

Animal-based diet, meaning mostly animal protein including milk, cheese, eggs, and honey plus organs like liver mixed with large amounts of fruit and few carbs. 

Shopping list example: 

eggs 
chicken breast or thighs
grass-fed milk 
Small block English cheddar cheese for snacking 
Grass-fed ground beef (85/15) 
Honey 
Organic coffee 
Apples
Cherries
Grapes 

I do not buy (except as a rare treat):

Soda
Juice
Bread 
Vegetarian protein (fake meat) 

I do use protein powder to hit the requirement of 1 gram of protein per pound of ideal weight, which for me is 200 lbs. 

One day of eating: 
Breakfast 
Three eggs cooked in homemade salsa (15 G protein) 
Black coffee (0 calories) 
50g protein shake 

First lunch 
8 oz of chicken on top of a small bed of rice or lettuce (50g protein)
Cheddar snack (1 oz)
1 apple 

Second lunch same thing 

Dinner 
1 lb grass fed ground beef with lettuce base (40g protein) 
Watermelon bowl 

Throughout the day I’m drinking about 1 - 2 gallons of water as well. 

Total protein: ~ 200 g 

The workout: 
For my workout I do push, pull, legs. Usually 6 days a week with one rest day but you can start with three days a week with four rest days. 

My push day:

**Last Night’s Energy: BACK ON THE BOARD!**

Saturday's 4-2 win over Bakersfield snapped our bizarre home slump (0-4-1), and the boys did it in style.

Jani Nyman (fresh off his Seattle stint) reminded everyone why he’s terrifying: two first-period goals in under 30 seconds. Cale Fleury, also back from Kraken duty, ripped one in from the blue line. Jagger Firkus got sneaky behind two Condors and buried Brouillard’s feed. Nikke Kokko did Nikke Kokko things: just 2 goals against on 18 shots. Casual.



**Tonight’s Stakes: Home Ice, Baby.**

With three games left in the regular season and just a three-point lead over San Jose, the Firebirds are still fighting to lock in home-ice advantage in the first round. That’s huge, since the best-of-three series all happen at the higher seed’s barn. We’re currently sitting fourth in the Pacific with 82 points—every point from here on out matters. You can check out the Playoff Primer [here](https://theahl.com/2025playoffprimer). 



**San Diego Gulls: What’s Good?**

They're 9th in the Pacific and playing for pride (and maybe some contracts). Watch out for: 

\-Sasha Pastujov: 43 points in 40 games. That’s not a typo.

\-Tristan Luneau: 41 assists from the blue line—kid dishes like it’s brunch.

\-Ryan Carpenter: quietly has 46 points and leads the team in faceoff dad energy.

\-Goalie watch: probably Oscar Dansk in net. His .886 SV% says: shoot early and often.



**Firebirds Players to Watch**

Penalty Kill: second-best in the AHL at 86.0%. You do not want to go to the box against us.

\-Jani Nyman: he’s back, he’s beautiful, and he’s up to 28 goals on the year.

\- Cale Fleury: 26 points in 37 games—he didn’t come back to coast.

\-Max Lajoie & Nik Brouillard: keep feeding the playmakers from the blue line.

   \-David Goyette: quietly heating up with 6 goals and a nose for the slot.



**Keys to Victory**

Get started early: Let’s not wait until game 70 to remember we’re a scoring team.

Stay out of the box: San Diego doesn’t have the best PP, but why risk it?

Ride the returnees: Nyman, Fleury, maybe Hayden—the cavalry’s here. Use it.



**Fun Fact Section**

Firebirds have never missed the playoffs in franchise history. Dynasty loading?

Jani Nyman is second among all AHL rookies in goals this season (28). Likely would have been first, but for his call-up.

Our penalty kill? Better than your morning coffee.
