Not a coffee expert here. Only started Aeropressing last year. I predominantly drink Black or Flat White simply. So I bought a Joepresso few months back. Writing this post because I almost gave up and wanted to throw the Joepresso away.

Tip 1: do not grind too fine. water flow can get stuck

Tip 2: start with 14grams. doing 17-18grams = water flow can get stuck

Tip 3: Tamp lightly or do not tamp, it is fine. I tamp with my finger. Haha

not a Tip: you can pour in hot water second round after your espresso shot to get ""filtered coffee"" not strong but decent taste. Not wasting coffee flavour = save the Earth?

Nothing deep knowledge but silly mistakes that caused me to need to press the aeropress super duper hard to squeeze out the coffee and check a few videos but still could not figure out. Joepresso info is not that many.",1,1769485097.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1qo2ksf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Transmeme/comments/1qo2ksf/want_to_understand_ultimate_truth/,want to understand ultimate truth ?,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1qo2iwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1qo2iwn/bellwether_shop_roaster_experiencereview/,Bellwether Shop Roaster Experience/Review,"Seriously considering purchasing a shop roaster Bellwether for my very small coffee roaster/shop. Let me give context.

I have been in the coffee industry for roughly 13 years. I love coffee and am very passionate about serving coffee to the best of my ability. Valuing high quality experience of customer interaction and high quality coffee. I have been roasting for about 3-4ish years, starting with a .5 kilo propane drum roaster. I started my cottage food law coffee roasting business at a farmers market at a midwestern small city with initial success. After my first year, I purchased a used 2010 2 kilo propane drum roaster. With a little TLC and dialing it in, loved the results I was getting. Started my 2nd year at the farmers market with a lot more success than the first year and by the end of the year, I was able to set myself up in a small (76 sq. feet small) walk up window in a great part of the city. 

I have a solid customer base who are excited and are wanting the coffee we produce. At this point, I am at a cross roads. I am stuck between the point of trying to move my roasting facility into a commercially approved facility and compliance (local and state regulations). In the meantime, I am using a local coffee roaster, solid coffee, but feeling as if I am not living up to my business model.

**So here are my thoughts**

1. I am currently quoted around $7,000 to ventilate my current coffee roaster. To me it's a lot and I already owe so much in my current build out of my walk up window.

2. I am feeling the pressure of needing to be able to provide my coffee for my current customers (they frequently ask for bags of coffee) and I feel like I'm letting them down.

3. With the restriction of my current space being so small, the idea of a ""plug and play"" type roaster is extremely attractive to me.

4. I'm not opposed to financing a machine of $22,000+ if I see that it will be worthwhile with wholesale and savings on my bar's end (instead of purchasing multiple 5 lbs bags at a time). I am aware that making it worth my while is on my end, I guess I'd like to hear others experience in taking that leap of faith with a machine and lined up accounts.

**What I am wanting to hear feedback on**

1. I know of a local roaster who purchased what I believe is to be the series 1 from Bellwether and no longer use it due to technical issues and lack of support. I have an aversion to using newer coffee technology if there is a lack of support (bad experience with a slayer V1 in my first specialty coffee shop). With that to say, do the newer models have the issues worked out? Is support actually supportive or responsive in assistance when needing it soon-ish?

2. How are the results when it comes to the overall quality of coffee? That is of utmost importance to me and I don't want to sacrifice quality for efficiency. I am wanting and willing to upload my own profiles.

3. With electric technology, my thoughts are the technology is not quick in it's response. I feel like it will take several seconds to acclimate to my adjustments. We all know with coffee roasting, seconds matter  in responsiveness.

I really like their no nonsense menu. Which is light roast, dark roast, and decaf. I just love the simplicity of “we keep it simple, this is all we have”. The guy who sold them to me said they were roasted the day before. The beans are crazy oily, and also very VERY dark. Like darkest I’ve ever had. I have heard that darker roasts can sometimes be oily but still good and or fresh

Is this anything to worry about? Other than maybe having to clean my grinder out more frequently? I always assumed oily meant not good in one way or another. Like the oils have made their way to the outside of the beans suggesting they’re old. I dialed them in and pulled 4 shots to get me close so I can enjoy my coffee tomorrow morning. It tasted ok, robust and deep as hell, that’s for sure. Like the final boss of dark roast. But I have two pounds of it, so I’d like to drink it.

The one thing that's been really obnoxious about the experience,  though,  is that our  LC (who is a replacement after our first one had to move away) says we are contractually obligated to take our kid to one meet-up a month. It's always nearly an hour away,  boring,  and a pain to get him to go. He has a ton of friends, and he and my son formed a band and they live a very busy and social life. In s couple of weeks he's supposed to go to this thing with ISE that starts at 7 am on a Saturday morning an hour away from our house.  

I totally get that these kids SHOULD be checked on and seen by the organization. I'm all for that.  But this planning is ridiculous. She even said that going forward they will have to miss extracurricular school activities if it's the same as her scheduled meet-ups. These days are different from the ones our original coordinator planned,  and the activities are just not enticing.  The first coordinator planned trips to nearby cities and the football stadium every other month,  with less time-intensive activities between.  Now he's going to have to get up at like 5:30 am on a Saturday to meet her for a progress report.  

These kids are not here to go to lame coffee shop meet-ups with kids they never see.  They are here to experience life,  and the meets are getting in the way of that.  How can they be involved in school activities if they're required to miss things.

New here—I’ll fill in the details on my situation and hoping for insights. Started low dose aspirin last May after PFO closure surgery. Always felt fine until over the holidays I ate poorly and drank a lot (esp New Year’s). Couple days after, started gnawing stomach discomfort, bloating, and gas that feels better with food.

Fearing an ulcer, I took Prilosec 20mg every morning for 2 weeks. Felt basically healed by end of week 1, but discomfort came back week 2. Not restarting PPIs till doctor appt, but can’t stop baby aspirin for clotting reasons. Wondering how my stomach can heal itself?

Also did stomach acid test: for 2 days, morning after baking soda (1/4 tsp in water), no burp for 7 min—makes me think low stomach acid? Coffee is the WORST trigger, but green tea and chamomile seem to soothe. Milk also upsets.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

•I had a good professional career

• Relationship started 2010

• Quit my job and moved 8hrs drive to live with him in smaller town

•Struggled to find work settled for low paying jobs

•When pregnant I encouraged him to ask to buy into company and be a partner at work, as we would have one income

• Two Kids (Had 1 child, married, had 2nd Child, both currently in primary school from 9-2.30pm weekdays)

• I always worked part time when pregnant or returned once each baby was 6m old (I like to and want to work)

• He was offered partnership which I contributed capital for, which meant his hours and workload increased (he only worked  3-4 days prev) , so I did EVERYTHING at home to support him in that as I saw it as a long term, team effort investment.

• At tax his income was distributed to me  ( on paper) to reduce tax, so he liked it when I dont work or only get 20-40k/yr

• He struggles with relationships/parenting/work used to get mad at me because he worked

• after years of arguing, due to his emotional avoidance and manipulation  I left in 2021, but struggled to find a place and would have to move away with kids as too expensive in his town, so he bought a house in the town and pays the mortgage and utilities, I spend all my pay on food and keeping the car running an4d the kids. I dont go anywhere or pay for social stuff, dont drink, dont smoke, even quite coffee to save money.

• Because hes been a slow learner with parenting at first he had kids 1 weekend a fortnight, and thats gradually increased, and we are just about to start 50/50 7days Sunday-sun shared care

• Part of the reason I seperated is because he is avoidant and separating would mean he has to spend time with the kids while they are young. Work wise he can do that now becuase he is higher up and can hire staff, so he schedules his work around having the kids.

• we have not officially divorced because he says it looks better on paper if he needs to apply for a loan or for tax purposes. So I just go along with that.

• It's great that he pays the mortgage and utilities (but also the funds come from a dividend that I helped raise capital for and instigated) but I want to become indpenedant, most of all because hes a bit of a psychological terrorist so he holds me to ransom about living in the house and anything to do with money, and I would like to talk to him as little as possible, so I would like to be more independant

• However Im finding that now I want to prioritise my career to do so, he is sabotaging my efforts a little, but most of all I cant find a job where I can work school hours one week and then full time or 24/7 the week I dont have the kids

• The way things are setup up seem to have really benefited him, because now he has the kids (at a time of life they can feed themselves and be left home alone for 20mins if needed) and his work is set up to accommodate this because we prioritised it, and Im trying to sort out a career for me but I dont have a babysitter/maid at home like he did.

• Now we are going 50/50 with the kids, I want a real job (career) but Im worried Im going to have to stick with cleaning and gig style jobs because I only have a bachelor's (psych) that I have not used yet, and employers seem to want people who can work 9-5 and devote themselves to the job which I can only do 1 out of 2 weeks.

• Im in my 40s so  I want to get established in a less physical role than cleaning in my older years. So I planned to work in lower level professional 9-5 roles starting this year so Im set up to have a less physical but also a higher professional role in 5-10 years time, but I also dont have a partner, so someone has to be home with the kids.

Also living in this town really doesnt have much on offer work wise. 

I cant be a cleaner until Im 70, so I need a plan or something support to make a change.

**TLDR I want to divorce and be fully independant but how can I if I have kids and my work options are constrained?** 

Should I bring anything up about the diviidends? 

I dont really want the house or anything, I just want autonomy, and to be there for my kids on the days I have them. 

**Does divorce take into account the setback a primary carer faces long term?** 

How do I go about this? 

Am I being screwed because hes kept me on a low income wage so he gets a tax break? 

or should I shut up and live like this for another 8-10years and then just walk away? 

He's used me as a maid and a babysitter and Im the default parent. To the point Im highly anxious because even when he has the kids he still calls up and says I have to take them if theyvare sick etc, so I also find it hard to commit to a job because he puts a lot of surprise problems on me. 

But I feel like as the kids get more self sufficient, he will have less of a need for me and I could be kicked to the curb at anytime.

I just want to make sure things are fair,  we are both in our kids lives but also my future is secure... if anyone can help? ",0,1769483476.0,AusLegal,2,0.5,False

Awhile ago a man sent me this message: ""Interesting to find someone else like me, who doesn't drink. My friends told me to state in my profile that I'm a casual drinker, to increase my chances, so that's what I did""

I refuse to lie about anything on my profile. I don't drink (never have except for tasting beer and wine once as a teen) because I don't like the taste and smell and don't want/need any substances affecting my brain. That's all.

It never occurred to me that it might conjure up various other things in people's minds.

Are people put off because they think you're ""no fun""?

Or do they suspect you're an alcoholic and thus can't/don't drink?

Like when I started a new job and the manager asked if I wanted tea or coffee. I said ""No thank you, I'll just have water"". She looked at me strangely and said ""Ohhh, are you religious?"" Huh? Nope. I just don't like tea or coffee. 

Most people think it's odd. ""Well what on earth do you drink then?""

Non-drinkers, what has been your OLD experience?

Drinkers, do you message or date non-drinkers?

A little about me. I’m 18, majoring in Biology with a pre-med track and planning to minor in Dance/ Exercise Science. I’d say I’m pretty chill and laid-back. I’m definitely social most of the time. Some things I enjoy are dance, hiking, hanging out with friends, drinking coffee, and yes, I still play Roblox.

For housing, I’m hoping for a double room in a suite of eight, ideally on mid-campus or south campus, I’m open to any suite-style dorms. I like to keep my space moderate to clean, and I usually do my studying in the library or outside the dorm, not really in the room. I’m flexible about sleep schedules, guests, noise, and temperature. I don’t mind sharing things like snacks, fridge space, or clothes, and I like a friendly, easygoing roommate vibe.

If this sounds like it could be a good fit, the best way to reach me is by Reddit DM. I’m happy to share my Instagram or phone number after we’ve chatted a bit. I can’t wait to meet someone fun, chill, and easygoing to share a suite with.",2,1769483126.0,UNC,0,1.0,False

If you long for Pink Suede, I would say that Khamrah Qahwa is \*pretty\* similar. The only big difference I notice is that Qahwa is missing that super juicy fruity note that Pink Suede has, perhaps from the blush berries. Qahwa is hardly sweet, but reminds me of a more toned-down, unisex version of Pink Suede. Which is good enough in my book. 

I tried the body cream and Qahwa together, since I sadly ran out of the body mist. Nothing spectacular as they’re so similar in scent, but the spicy notes of Qahwa balance out the juicyness of Suede. Still a very great combo!!",2,1769483116.0,bathandbodyworks,2,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1769482982.0,TransAdvice,0,1.0,False

1qo1wsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1qo1wsx/grinder_confusion_300/,Grinder Confusion [300$],"Alrighty.

**Beans:** all roast types  
**Coffee style:** Lattes, straight espresso, pour overs (we use a basic electric grinder \~30$)  
**Machine:** Bambino  
**Budget**: around 300 USD. (must be somewhat easily available in US)  
**Workflow needs**: set it and forget it, \~2 espresso drinks or so per day, no clumping/static, little to no mess.

I've seen rec's for the DF series but am put off by the people claiming it has static/clog/QC issues that require people farting around with it to get it to work long-term. I've also seen rec's for the Baratza  ESP or pro line but I worry this is not much better. People have recommended the Niche Zero, but its a bit more expensive and I cannot easily get it in the US.  The Eureka machines (zero/facile) look intriguing but im not sold on it, plus it seems a bit more pricey. I looked into Varia VS3 (second edition) though people are complaining that the dial still moves and its big power brick is unsightly. The Vs4 seems like its fixed the issues but has a large price tag that other brands beat.

I really am not too picky about the micro details, I just want something I can reasonably afford in the USA that can grind beans for espresso consistently and just works. The simplicity is very important to me. A hopper is a plus and the ability to adjust for the occasional pour over is also, but these are not must-haves.

They regularly pull out of their 401ks and use it like a savings account. They own their home but don't maintain it. I recently learned that they owe money in taxes because they just have avoided it for the last few years.

They are constantly complaining about money and saying that they can't afford anything, but I have no idea how. They have a $2000 mortgage and make about 115k a year. I don't understand how they spend their money or where it goes. They do smoke cigarettes which I know adds up, and my dad plays about $15 of keno/lottery a day. My mom buys a dunks iced coffee every day for like $4. (I do think that they deserve little things that make them happy).

In the oldest of five and all I know it's not my responsibility to take care of them, but I want to make sure they can retire. They are great parents who both work physically demanding jobs. I don't want to see them struggle and have to work into their 70s. But at the same time, my husband and I want to start a family and I am so bitter at them for not planning themselves. I honestly think they're just assuming they'll die or hit big in the lottery before it's time to deal with it.

What steps can I take to help them? They're very sensitive to talking about money and will shut me down immediately if I try and bring it up. Maybe I can set them up to talk to a CPA? Any other suggestions?",2,1769482946.0,FinancialPlanning,18,0.67,False

So here's the recipe:( please note i live in India and have bought some ingredients that are available locally to me such as specific brands of cream , spices, utensils such as manual egg beater, baking tray etc after checking the labels. you can modify as per the ingredients you get locally while ensuring you are on keto) 

I've also used Ai to refine the text. 

Keto ice cream
Ingredients
 * 1.5 cups Amul or D'lecta Whipping Cream (Cold)
 * 2 tbsp Unsweetened Cocoa Powder
 * 1 tsp Instant Coffee powder (dissolved in 1 tsp warm water)
 * Stevia to taste
 * 1/4 cup Chopped Walnuts or Almonds
 * A pinch of Sea Salt (essential to balance Stevia)

 * Prep the Pan: Place your metal baking pan in the freezer immediately to get it ice-cold.
 * The Coffee-Choco Base: In a small bowl, mix the cocoa powder, dissolved coffee, Stevia, and salt with 2 tablespoons of the cream to make a smooth paste. This prevents cocoa lumps.
 * Whip the Cream: Pour the rest of the cold cream into a chilled bowl. Use your manual egg beater and crank vigorously for about 5–8 minutes. You are aiming for stiff peaks—where the cream stands up on its own. This air is what keeps it soft without the 30-minute stirring rule.
 * Fold it Together: Gently fold your chocolate-coffee paste into the whipped cream using a spatula. Do not over-mix, or you’ll lose the air. Fold in half of your nuts now.
 * The Thin Freeze: Spread the mixture into your pre-chilled baking pan in a thin layer (about 1 inch thick). Sprinkle the remaining nuts on top.
 * Seal and Freeze: Press your baking paper directly onto the surface of the cream to block out air. Place it on the floor of the freezer.

Keto kulfi: 
 
Ingredients
 * 1.5 cups Amul or D’lecta Whipping Cream (Cold)
 * Stevia to taste (start with a small amount and adjust)
 * 1/4 tsp Green Cardamom (Elaichi) powder
 * 1/4 tsp Ground Cinnamon
 * 8-10 Saffron (Kesar) strands, soaked in 1 tsp warm cream
 * Optional: 1 tbsp chopped almonds for texture
Instructions (The 2-Hour Method)
 * Infuse the Flavors: In a small pan, simmer 1/2 cup of the cream with the cardamom, cinnamon, and saffron for about 3–5 minutes. This ""blooms"" the spices and gives you that authentic cooked-milk flavor.
 * Sweeten and Cool: Stir in your Stevia while the mixture is warm. Once combined, let this base cool completely in the fridge for about 10 minutes.
 * Whip the Remainder: While the base cools, take the remaining 1 cup of cold cream and use your manual egg beater to whip it until it is thick and airy (soft peaks). This aeration ensures you don't need to stir it every 30 minutes.
 * Combine: Gently fold the spiced, cooled cream into the whipped cream until the color is uniform.
 * Fill the Moulds: Pour the mixture into your 6 kulfi moulds.
 * The Seal: Cover each mould by pressing a small square of baking paper directly against the surface of the cream to prevent ice crystals.
 * Flash Freeze: Place the moulds in your freezer. They should be set in approximately 2 hours.

1qo1q0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1qo1q0k/the_cigarette_case/,The Cigarette Case,"🇵🇱Gdańsk, Poland. The 90s.

Kazimierz found the cigarette case one morning on a bench as he walked his usual route through the park to the shipyard, where he worked as a painter. In the gloom, the ugly outlines of creaking cranes loomed, resembling sick birds, and the smell of dampness and rotting autumn leaves seemed to crawl directly into his soul, causing fits of melancholy.

Kazimierz looked around and, seeing no one nearby, picked up the case from the rain-soaked bench. It was silver, looked simple — without inscriptions or engravings. On the move, Kazimierz opened it and saw that it was full.

— O kurwa! — Kazimierz exclaimed with joy. — O kurwa! To dobrze!

He was genuinely happy about the find: his cigarettes had run out yesterday, and Kazimierz desperately wanted a smoke. He took out a filter cigarette with no markings, sniffed it, and, after making sure it was tobacco, lit it and took a greedy drag. His head swam, and with a sigh of relief, he exhaled the smoke, noting that the tobacco was excellent. Pleased, feeling as if on wings, Kazimierz hurried to the gate to make it to his shift on time.

The rusty wind beat against the walls of the smoking area when the crew came out for their afternoon break.

— Got a smoke, Kazimierz? — his partner Tadeusz asked, coughing terribly and spitting up yellow phlegm. — We’ll smoke mine tomorrow.

— Here, — Kazimierz said, opening the case and offering him a cigarette.

— Wow, good tobacco, — Tadeusz said, taking a drag, and again went into a fit of coughing, exhaling smoke.

— Kurwa mać, this painting work will be the end of me, I’ll cough up my lungs, — Tadeusz rasped glumly.

Kazimierz remained silent. He knew about the harm, but he continued to go to this job, as if chained, just like all the other laborers. He saw their thoughts on their faces in the morning and knew what they were thinking when they walked home from work.

The next morning, Kazimierz, as always, woke up earlier than anyone else and left while his son and wife were still asleep. Coffee and a cigarette on an empty stomach were his loyal morning friends. And, opening the case, he saw that it was full again.

— Matko Boska!, that can’t be! — Kazimierz exclaimed and began to carefully examine the case and the cigarettes. Nothing unusual. But he couldn’t believe his eyes and tore up one cigarette: it looked like tobacco, good tobacco, and the smell was right.

— Fine, — he said, snapping the case shut and finding no explanation for what had happened. He lit up, sipping his coffee, looking out the window, and thinking about the miracles that still happen in this world.

So several days passed, and every morning the case was full. Kazimierz, offering the foreman a cigarette in the morning, asked about Tadeusz.

— I called his wife, Agnieszka, last night, — the foreman replied. — She said he died. First, he started throwing up blood, and then he coughed up his lungs into the sink. The ambulance didn’t make it.

— Jezu Chryste… — Kazimierz whispered, his blood running cold, and stepped away. He understood that the case was the cause. The very one from which he had been handing out cigarettes left and right. “Who’s next?” — Kazimierz thought with horror. After smoking down to the filter and burning his fingers, he immediately lit the next one.

— Heard the news, Kazimierz? — the workers asked in the smoking area.

— What news? — he asked, growing cold inside.

— Waldek, our grinder, died. He choked on phlegm in his sleep. How did he manage that?..

Kazimierz shrugged indifferently and, without another word, went back to work.

Over the next few months, a series of accidents and fatal illnesses wiped out almost the entire old crew of their shift. Only Kazimierz and a few other guys who didn’t smoke were left. Just yesterday, after work, when Kazimierz offered a cigarette to a new guy, the man died in a crash, his head hitting the dash as his car swerved into oncoming traffic. The cause of the accident was a cigarette that had fallen onto the seat.

Maybe the cigarette case wasn’t forgotten or lost, but left there on purpose? Maybe someone before couldn’t bear the weight and got rid of it that way?

These thoughts swirled in Kazimierz’s head as he stood early in the morning in that same gloomy park at the familiar bench. He thought: it’s time to leave it, to throw it away for good, enough!

At the same time, he rationalized it to himself: now he was more careful — he only offered cigarettes from the case to random passersby. For his own, he had a regular pack.

— Tomorrow… I’ll throw it away tomorrow, — Kazimierz promised himself and hurried to work, knowing deep down that this “tomorrow” would never come.

That night, his son woke up, needing to use the toilet. Returning, he noticed the edge of the cigarette case sticking out of his father’s jacket pocket. Listening — everyone was asleep — he quietly and carefully pulled out two cigarettes for himself and a friend.

“Well, even if Dad notices, what’s he gonna do? Spank me?” — the boy thought.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

So I began keto over 2 weeks ago. I started slowly because I wasn't sure if I wanted to do this- my main motivation was friends who have taken it who have had massive increases in energy. Week 1 was fine, though I went over the 20g carbs goal frequently. Week 2, I got more serious and started to get keto flu symptoms- low energy, nausea, lack of appetite, headache. I course corrected with electrolytes and broth. But appetite and and energy have not come back. I tried the keto urine test straps today and came back purple, so I think I am in the right spot, but I need guidance for a few things.

Firstly- I'm really struggling to meet my macros, I just don't have the appetite for 1,500 calories everyday anymore. I'm doing okay at keeping under 20g of net carbs as shown above.  Should I be concerned about not getting enough protein or fats?

I am a swimmer, and I like lifting weights and dancing, but the last 2 times I went to work out, I fell asleep at my desk the next day. Not great. If I'm showing as in ketosis, (urine strips) where is my energy? Is this tiredness from not eating enough fat? This is so much worse than before I started.

If I drink a glass of water, I have to pee 20min later. I'm waking up in the night parched. I'm adding salt to my water, but is this normal? Today i drank a liter of decaf coffee, 2 liters of herbal tea, a liter of stock, a liter of electrolyte water. Still just in and out. Is this normal?

I guess i'm just looking for assurance that this is all normal and i'm just going through the usual process. ",1,1769482261.0,ketobeginners,1,1.0,False

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Nothing out of the ordinary, but turns out, I managed to place it directly under one of my monstera’s stems. Once it drooped and I noticed it, I put the candle out and propped the stem up on another, taller candle in hopes that it would somehow heal. It didn’t burn it, it’s not charred, but the heat literally cooked it. 

Now, it’s been a week or so and the part that I cooked has gone dark and hard. I’m thinking if I leave it this way, the leaf is gonna die. Although, if I can save it and keep it on the plant somehow, please tell me how!!

My dilemma is what to do now? Could the healthy part of my plant be taking the nutrients from the dying part or is it just dying? Could I snip the leaf off just above the cooked part and propagate it? Do I wait for it to die before removing it or should I just get it over with? I don’t want to put my monstera through too much stress if I can as it only will have three leaves left after this one goes.

General info about the plant: 

I don’t water it as much as I should, but it’s frequent enough so that it doesn’t droop often! 

I have it right in a window but being in a NYC apartment, I only get two hours a day of direct sunlight.

I put coffee grounds and eggshells in the soil to give it extra nutrients after I traumatized it.

The affected leaf started to yellow yesterday and it’s going quickly.

Overall: boy howdy it was rough, but I’d do it again. 

In my initial recovery I was on a crack load of calcium and vitamin D, and that sent my into hypercalcemia, which put my in the hospital for three days. They then told me don’t take any calcium, so I didn’t, then I was back in the hospital with hypocalcemia and hypokalemia. I decided I’d had enough of being yanked around and figured out what dose/nutrient balance worked for me, and ignored doctor’s orders for about a week and it sorted itself out. 

I got a skin infection that required antibiotics. My T3 and T4 got high and my TSH was super low, and all that triggered All Of The Itchy that I’m still trying to get straightened out - dyshydrosis on my hands, weeping plaques on my scalp, rashes on the underarms, and incredibly fragile skin. 

OK THAT’S ENOUGH OF THE BAD

Through all of this though I have felt fantastic. My mind is clear, and though it takes me a little longer to get to sleep since I have energy, the sleep is restful. Coffee is optional (when my preschooler sleeps, anyway). I’ve joined the local Y and enjoy going, and still have the energy to do household things after. So yes it has been ROUGH, but even if I knew I’d have to go through all of it I’d still do it. My anxiety is so much less, my brain can think through problems without panicking. My relationship with my husband is better. I’m more patient with our daughter. I even think my hEDS symptoms are better. We went to the aquarium and I didn’t have to lie down after. I feel ten years younger because I can DO things again.

1qo1gom,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1qo1gom/airing_myself_out/,airing myself out,"my “ghost story” is pretty short compared to a lot of the ones i see on this sub. however, it similarly continues to kick my ass. i’m sleep deprived and sad and i feel so incredibly insane so i’m gonna rant about it now. read all about it if you want!

talking about it just feels like beating a dead horse but unfortunately it keeps popping back up in my mind. i know time will help more than anything i can do. it already has a lot—while it still comes back at times, it’s not so extreme, not every day, not as painful.

but it still does come back. the whole situation feels ridiculous. it feels terrible for a lot of reasons.

**timeline, context.**

i “officially” got ghosted in mid november. but i could feel him pulling away ever since our date in early october. we matched on hinge mid september, the same day i suffered a pretty bad injury i would need surgery for.

i’m 21, so is he. i’ve notoriously avoided dating basically forever. i’m not very good at being vulnerable or feeling comfortable with intimacy or being an object of desire. the people i have “been involved” with were mostly just crushes, weird talking stages, or weird intimate experiences. i finally felt like putting myself out there, just to get experience. i knew it would get easier the more i experimented. my short term goal for myself was just: go on a date with Someone, and don’t have any expectations for it. i was fine with the idea of a bad date, and i certainly wasn’t expecting anything groundbreaking for my first official date ever. i was open to whatever hinge could offer, lol.

i’m giving context mostly because i feel clueless about what “matters” in my situation or for how things played out. i just don’t have a lot of similar data to pull from, it feels difficult sometimes to judge this situation objectively.

anyways…

i’d been entertaining many options on hinge, feeling things out, but nothing was piquing my interest in particular — which again, wasn’t the point really, but just to frame where i was at when i matched with this guy.

i recognized him from a club i was considering joining a couple weeks earlier in the semester — when i saw him then i thought he was super attractive, and he was in leadership, which i also found attractive. i didn’t end up joining, and that was just a passing thought really, but i honestly am not attracted to people like that very often. maybe it had to do with the fact that i found someone in my own major attractive, which genuinely never happens lmao. whatever the reason, it felt extra strange that i saw him on hinge so shortly after. like a synchronicity, kinda. not to mention it all happened the day i got injured, which i was completely depressed about, but this was an enticing my distraction. anyways, it just made it more interesting for me.

we hit it off fast. he asked for my number within the hour, i gave it to him, and we started texting for \~2 weeks. it was fun and playful and exciting. he was direct and flirty but seemed genuinely curious about me. eventually, we planned a first date.

**the date.**

i was obviously nervous, obviously excited, scared but also hopeful, as one gets before a date they’re looking forward to. i did not expect my first date ever to be one i was really looking forward to — i had set my expectations extremely low! but i considered myself lucky. i hadn’t been excited about someone like this in a while. the thrill was fun.

this is gonna be long, so ill try to avoid excessive detail. but the date went really, really great. conversation felt effortless, banter was fun and easy. i felt relaxed being myself, i didn’t feel like i had to put on some performance, which i often do just in every day life. we talked about growing up, our families, our work, our hobbies, our interests, our school. we clicked on all levels, really. i didn’t really have a box unchecked, no red flags raised. it becomes hard to talk about this because i always feel like i am exaggerating. but that’s what i remember experiencing, that’s what i had written down when it first happened, and i think i owe it to myself not to change this part of the story just because it ended on a low note.

after our planned portion of the date, neither of us wanted to call it there. so we went to a small party one of my friends was hosting, which was super fun and i continued to feel great about this guy. at this point we had both drank a substantial amount, but not so much it overshadowed the experience in any way. the interest still felt mutual, it still felt fun, it felt very genuine. one of my friends told me the next day she noticed him playing with my hair at one point. if that means anything. lol.

i certainly did not expect myself to invite him back to my house. again, though, it felt as if it was perfectly lined up. my house was a block away from this party. we walked back with my roommate and friend, we all laughed and chatted for a while. they went to bed and eventually we did, too. we watched an episode of a show we both love.

and then we had sex. and he was my first time. and trust me, my expectations for losing my virginity were even lower than those for my first date. but jesus christ man, he was great AGAIN! i will spare you the details, but, trust. it exceeded my expectations Greatly.

i wasn’t waiting to “lose it” for any particular reason. the opportunity had just never presented itself and i hadn’t taken much initiative up until this point to make it happen. i’m not interested in hookups or casual sex. that has literally zero appeal to me. i knew i’d only want to do it with someone i felt comfortable with, and felt more deeply about.

**morning.**

once we started to wake up, he continued to hold me close. he kissed me, gently, then passionately, then all around my face, my body, and back to my face again. he let me kiss him the same way. we paused and silently looked at each other, just an inch away. he brought his hand to my chin, thumb to my bottom lip, softly caressing it down, then releasing it, over and over and over. it was sweet. soft. special. really hard to describe with words.

this is the part i always cry at, without fail, when i think about him. maybe it’s my lack of experience. maybe i was just thrilled to be desired, chosen, by a boy. maybe it’s just the psychology of having sex for the first time. maybe it was just a “spark,” and that’s it. maybe i just make a big deal out of shit that is insignificant to everyone else. maybe it was just a hookup to him and i missed some cue to indicate that. maybe he’s a man whore. maybe i’m his second, third, fourth choice while he waits on someone else. maybe i was manipulated and im completely blind to it.

but i have felt chosen before, i’ve felt desired, i’ve experienced closeness and intimacy. and this was undoubtedly distinct. i have never felt something that tender, that eager, that excited, that playful, that passionate, that attentive, that gentle, that patient, that genuine, all at the same time with the same person. i can’t say it more plainly. i’m not trying to exaggerate or misrepresent it. to me, it was singular.

and just because i hadn’t felt that before, doesn’t make it less true. at least that’s what i’ve been telling myself.

as he left my place that morning he hugged me, kissed my head, my cheeks, my lips. i called out to him to text and he assured me he would. he did. but it didn’t take long to notice a shift.

**after**.

as time went on it became more and more apparent he was avoiding making any set plans or commitments. i gave him the chance to opt out, he told me he was definitely still interested and had a great time, but was busy and asked if we could just text until his schedule opened up. i was fishy about that last part, in hindsight it feels like a glaringly obvious sign. but in that moment i was so nervous about confronting him at all that i mostly just felt relieved, and i felt hopeful that we would see each other again, and that he was telling the truth when he said he wanted to. but predictably, nothing really changed, he continued to pull away, and it fell on me to initiate conversation.

i did not want to abandon hope immediately. i have chased people before, i know what it feels like, i knew where this might be heading. but it didn’t make any fucking sense at all. i couldn’t bring myself to actually accept it, because this wasn’t like those other times. i was certain my experience was not one sided. you just wouldn’t click with someone like that if it was. i might be inexperienced in love but i know what depth in connection feels like — notably in my friendships, whose depth and sincerity i’m proud of having built and sustained.

in past situations, my anxious side has really come out. i’m well aware of these tendencies. and this time, i didn’t want to repeat that pattern. and you know what? i did a great job. i’m proud of myself for how i handled it. i did the best i could. i was patient, i gave space, i tried to be direct, i tried to compromise, but i did not neglect my wants, which was to continue going out with him. investment seemed like the natural progression. i wanted to keep things moving beyond just texting, because that doesn’t fucking count as anything. it didn’t line up.

i knew he was drifting off. i couldn’t really take it. so i asked one final time to hang out — the easiest date ever: coffee — and he never responded. a week later it was pretty set in stone. i texted a flippant “my bad” and deleted the text chain from my phone.

i know of course it was not my bad. it’s entirely his bad. but it seems like i’m the one being punished. my chest felt like it was physically hollowing out. i don’t want to regret my decisions with him because i was following my gut, leading with my heart, leaning into the joy i was experiencing instead of withholding it from myself like i so often do. i was trusting because i had faith in that joy. rarely has that trust lead me astray. i don’t want to regret letting myself get excited about someone. someone who was genuinely promising. it wasn’t even about “potential”… i got a real glimpse at who he is. and fuck man. we seemed like such a great fit. it’s like it was too good to be true, too good to last. i know i didn’t sign up for anything certain, i know i barely knew him, i know i intended to keep my expectations low. but it’s like i made a sound investment, and it skyrocketed for a second, and then started to tank for inexplicable reasons.

some outside force beyond my control changed the tides. i couldn’t have seen it coming. and i couldn’t conjure sunshine once the clouds started to roll in.

i hate feeling so heavily over this. i feel foolish for caring, for being invested, for giving something so short lived so much importance. i feel like a freak if im being honest. like most people would just get over this. like this is just part of the game and im too incompetent to play along. like i’m missing something.

i cant really change who i am. i’m a sensitive motherfucker. i’ve always felt singled out because of it. like the extent of what i feel is just incompatible with most people, that i must adjust and monitor myself to meet people’s emotional expectations.

i feel this so deeply right now. it sucks a lot. i feel crazy.

i can’t count how many times i almost messaged him or how many fake confrontations i’ve played out in my head. there was an event last week i thought i would almost certainly see him at, but he wasn’t there. i didn’t have a plan even if he had been. i wish, of course, he would just apologize. i won’t act like i don’t desire an explanation, even if it doesn’t change anything.

right now, i just want to yell at him. i want him to see how this has hurt me. but i cringe at the thought of him just thinking im insane, dismissing me. the thought of him not caring even the slightest. i have suspicions that he’s talking to someone else. which, like, duh. i’m under no illusion that he actually cares about me. but i just don’t know how to make sense of what happened between him and i. is he a sociopath? what was he going through? why couldn’t he tell me? i don’t even want him anymore. of course i wish things could be different, but i try not to kid myself. at my core im just desperate to make it feel right, to make myself known, to resolve this some how. i don’t know what that even looks like.

logically, i know my feelings are perfectly valid. i don’t feel a compulsion to convince him or anyone that they matter. i value myself and what i felt and my experience. it was important to me. it is impossible to shake the want for it to be important to him. but if it was, this situation would be much more symmetrical, wouldn’t it? if that was the case, maybe i wouldn’t be writing this now. i don’t know.

that mismatch is hard to accept. it hurts to accept. and it’s aggravating not knowing exactly what the reason behind it is. what his experience was. why he left me high and dry. how i can feel this strongly over something so short lived, someone i barely even knew.

and i still really want to yell at him about it. i know there’s no use. but fuck do i want to. i’m looking for a way to justify it, lol. it’s not like it’ll speed up the process of letting go. if anything, it will slow it down. i know all the things. but i bet that release would feel fucking awesome. but who knows. clearly i don’t fucking know anything.

***if i am actually being crazy…. please god someone tell me*** 😭

okay. rant over. i have a life i love to go and live. gonna try and trust in the universe or something. nothing else i can do. (except yell at him. which i might do. because what EVER! IM MAD!)

doubt anyone will read this bc it’s long as Fuckkkkk but if u did hi i guess. thanks. i’ll probably delete this out of embarrassment within the hour.

I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",1,1769481752.0,stayawake,0,1.0,False

1qo1fp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qo1fp0/where_the_distance_collapsed/,Where the Distance Collapsed,"My name is **Evan Alder**, and for the last twelve years I’ve been the person people call when someone doesn’t come home.

That’s not a poetic way of putting it. It’s the job description, just without the bullet points.

Search and Rescue work is mostly arithmetic; time, distance, elevation gain, weather windows, daylight. We turn lives into numbers because numbers are honest, and because hope, by itself, is not a plan. I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",2,1769481727.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

1qo1far,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1qo1far/where_the_distance_collapsed/,Where the Distance Collapsed,"My name is **Evan Alder**, and for the last twelve years I’ve been the person people call when someone doesn’t come home.

That’s not a poetic way of putting it. It’s the job description, just without the bullet points.

Search and Rescue work is mostly arithmetic; time, distance, elevation gain, weather windows, daylight. We turn lives into numbers because numbers are honest, and because hope, by itself, is not a plan. I’ve coordinated everything from sprained ankles to late-season hypothermia to recoveries no one says out loud until you’re back at the command trailer and the radios finally go quiet.

I’ve learned what fear looks like on paper.

It shows up as missed check-ins, wrong trailheads, a vehicle that’s still warm in the parking lot, a water bottle left behind like it fell out of a hand that didn’t have time to close.

This one started with a single sentence from dispatch that I didn’t like the sound of.

“Missing hiker,” the deputy said over the phone, “and his last known location doesn’t make sense.”

That was what he led with, as if that kind of thing was rare.

It was a Tuesday in early fall, one of those sharp mornings where the air looks clean enough to drink. The first frost hadn’t hit yet, but the nights were cold, and the trees were already deciding what to keep.

The missing hiker was named **Caleb Rourke**, thirty-two, software engineer from the city, weekend backpacker. His girlfriend, **Jillian Park**, called it in when he didn’t answer her texts by nightfall. That part was normal. His vehicle was at the south trailhead of a backcountry network the locals just called *the bowls*, because the terrain folded into itself in a series of steep drainages and rounded ridgelines. You could be two miles from your car and still feel like you’d been swallowed.

The deputy’s issue was Caleb’s phone location. Jillian had shared it through one of those “find my” apps, desperate and practical at the same time. The dot wasn’t hovering over the parking lot or the first mile of trail. It was deep. Too deep for a day hike unless you were moving with purpose.

And the timestamp attached to the last ping made it worse.

The last location update came in at **4:18 PM**, and it put Caleb nearly **eight miles in**, past the second bowl and close to a ridge that took most people half a day to reach even with a light pack.

Jillian insisted he’d planned a short loop. Four miles, maybe five, back before dark. She’d said it through tears, but she’d said it with certainty.

Eight miles in by 4:18, and then nothing. No movement. No further pings.

It looked like he’d stopped.

In our world, stopping is what kills you.

By the time I drove up to the trailhead, my incident kit was already sitting on the passenger seat like a weight. Maps, flagging tape, extra batteries, laminated grid overlays, spare radio mic. I parked beside the deputy’s SUV and found Jillian on the tailgate, clutching a phone so hard her knuckles had bleached.

She looked up when I approached. Her eyes were raw like she’d been swimming in something abrasive.

“I can show you,” she said immediately, as if I might not believe her.

I introduced myself, and she gave a jerky nod. Jillian was in her late twenties, hair pulled into a messy knot, wearing running shoes that had never seen dirt. She was trying to be a person who could handle this.

The deputy, **Mark Denton**, stood nearby with his arms folded, watching the tree line like he expected it to move.

Jillian shoved the screen toward me.

The dot was exactly where Mark had described it. Deep in the bowls, pinned to a tight contour section that the map labeled with nothing but elevation lines stacked like teeth. A place that didn’t have a name, which meant it wasn’t a place most people went on purpose.

I asked the questions I always ask.

“What time did he leave?”

“Ten forty. Maybe ten fifty.”

“What was he wearing?”

“Gray jacket. Blue pack. He has a red beanie. He always wears it.”

“Experience level?”

“He hikes a lot. He’s not stupid.”

Nobody is stupid until they are cold, alone, and trying to make the world behave.

“Any medical issues?”

She shook her head. “He… he had a GPS app. He had a battery pack. He was excited. He said he wanted to get away from screens for once, which was… funny, because he literally builds them.”

She tried to laugh, and it broke halfway out.

I looked at the map again. Eight miles in. The dot was static. If Caleb had stopped because he’d twisted an ankle, he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he’d gotten lost and decided to “wait it out,” he might still be alive. If he’d stopped because he couldn’t move, then we were already late.

I started the operation.

Within an hour we had our command trailer set up, our whiteboard filled with names and assignments, and a half-dozen volunteers arriving in dusty trucks. Our team is a patchwork of professions; nurses, mechanics, a high school math teacher, a guy who runs a towing company, a retired firefighter who still wears his old station jacket like armor.

I called in **Tessa Wynn**, our logistics lead, who could run a staging area like an airport. I called **Luis Ortega**, our best tracker, whose eyes didn’t miss broken fern stems or a scuffed rock. I called **Casey Harlow**, our comms specialist, who had the kind of calm voice that made frightened people breathe slower.

By noon, we had two hasty teams ready to deploy, and one technical team on standby in case we had to rope down into one of the bowls.

The plan was straightforward; you always start by assuming the world is normal.

Team One would head toward Caleb’s last known ping location along the main trail, then cut into the first drainage and work their way up. Team Two would approach from the east ridge and look down into the bowls from above, scanning for movement, color, any sign of a pack or a person. If we found a track, Luis would take it. If we found evidence, we’d expand the search.

I briefed everyone, and I watched their faces as I pointed at the map. They were listening, but I could see the subtle shift when I mentioned the distance.

Eight miles. Steep terrain. Late afternoon ping. No movement.

We were all doing the same math.

Casey ran radio checks. Everything came back clean.

“Tessa to Base, radio check.”

“Base to Tessa, loud and clear.”

“Luis to Base, check.”

“Base to Luis, loud and clear.”

Team One moved out first. I stayed at base with Casey and Tessa, monitoring, updating, and keeping the operation’s shape intact. That’s what incident coordinators do; we don’t chase, we direct. We keep the puzzle pieces from turning into scattered debris.

At **1:12 PM**, Team One called their first check-in. They’d reached the first junction, exactly as expected.

At **1:47 PM**, Team Two checked in from the ridge approach, moving steadily, no visual on Caleb.

At **2:09 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One. We’ve got sign.”

My spine tightened.

“Go ahead.”

“Fresh boot scuffs off the main trail, about a mile and a half in. Not on the map, not a social trail either. It’s like he stepped off on purpose.”

“Any other prints?”

“Hard to tell. Soil’s dry. But there’s a consistent scuff pattern, same tread. Looks like a trail runner, not a boot.”

That matched Jillian’s description. Running shoes.

Luis added, “He’s moving fast, or he was. The scuffs are long, like he was taking big strides.”

I wrote it on the board. Unplanned off-trail. Fast movement.

“Track it,” I said. “Mark it. Keep comms tight.”

“Copy.”

Normal so far. People step off trail. They follow game paths, they chase a view, they think they can shortcut. Eighty percent of our rescues begin with someone deciding the map is optional.

At **2:42 PM**, the first inconsistency arrived like a stone through glass.

“Base, this is Team One.”

I recognized the voice; **Drew Calhoun**, steady, competent. “Go ahead, Team One.”

“We’re… we’re at the creek crossing.”

I frowned. The creek crossing was three miles in, not one and a half. “Confirm location.”

Drew exhaled. “Creek crossing. It’s the one with the fallen log, the wide bend. We’ve got the rock outcrop on the left, and the dead snag on the right, same as the map notes.”

I looked at the map. I looked at the clock. Team One left base at 12:55. It was 2:42. That was one hour and forty-seven minutes.

To reach that creek crossing in under two hours, they would’ve had to jog, and even then it didn’t make sense with packs.

“Drew,” I said carefully, “what pace are you moving?”

A pause. “Normal. We’re not pushing. Terrain’s been… easier than I remember.”

“Easier,” Casey mouthed, watching me.

I pushed my thumb against the map edge as if the paper might correct itself.

“Any chance you took the wrong fork?” I asked.

“No,” Drew said, and the way he said it made my stomach drop. He sounded offended, but not because I’d questioned him. Because the question itself didn’t fit what he was seeing.

He added, “We passed the junction, we confirmed it. We’re on the right trail. Evan, we’re where we are.”

There are moments in this job where you choose between arguing with reality and adapting to it. I didn’t know which one this was.

“Copy,” I said. “Hold for a minute. I’m going to cross-check.”

I muted my mic and looked at Casey. “Check their last GPS breadcrumb,” I said. “The team unit, not their phones.”

Casey pulled up the tracking dashboard. Each team carried a shared GPS unit that dropped points at intervals. It wasn’t fancy, but it was reliable.

Her eyes narrowed. “That’s… weird.”

“What?”

“They’re showing at the creek crossing,” she said, “but their breadcrumb trail isn’t continuous. There’s a gap.”

“How big?”

Casey zoomed. “Two miles. One point is near the junction, then the next point is… just past the creek.”

I stared. A gap like that meant the unit had lost signal, or been turned off. But the forest wasn’t dense enough for a complete blackout, and Drew wasn’t sloppy.

“Ask if they powered down,” I said.

Casey keyed up. “Team One, Base. Confirm GPS unit status. Any power loss, battery swap, or shutdown?”

Drew replied immediately. “Negative. Unit’s been on the whole time.”

Casey looked at me. In the trailer, the radio hiss filled the silence between our breaths.

I told myself it was a glitch. Satellite drift. Device error. The kind of thing that happens and gets blamed on trees and terrain.

Then Luis called again.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go ahead.”

“You’re not going to like this,” Luis said, and his voice had lost its normal calm.

I sat forward. “Say it.”

“I was tracking the scuffs. They led me down into the first drainage, then… they just stop.”

“Stop like on rock?”

“No. Stop like someone picked him up and set him down somewhere else. The scuff pattern ends at a flat patch of dirt. No pivot, no stumble, no turnaround. Just… ends.”

The image formed in my mind; a line drawn, then cut clean.

Luis continued, “I found a water bottle. Clear plastic. Still cold, like it hasn’t been sitting in the sun long.”

My pulse thudded once, hard.

“Is it his?” I asked.

“There’s a sticker on it,” Luis said. “A tech company logo. A rocket.”

Jillian had mentioned he worked in software. People put their identity on their gear now, like we’re all branded.

“Bag it,” I said. “Mark location.”

Luis hesitated. “Evan… that location is wrong.”

“What do you mean?”

“I’m looking at the map. I’m standing where the scuffs ended. This should be a steep section. It should be brush and loose rock. But it’s flat, like a shelf. Like the hillside got shaved off.”

I rubbed my forehead. A flat shelf in the drainage. Not impossible, but unusual.

“Send coordinates,” I said.

Casey took them and plotted. Her brows lifted.

“That’s not in the drainage,” she said quietly. “That’s… that’s closer to Bowl Two.”

Bowl Two was miles away.

I stared at the screen. “Maybe the coordinate format is wrong.”

Casey shook her head. “No. It’s correct.”

I keyed up. “Luis, confirm you’re seeing the first drainage. Confirm landmarks.”

Luis answered with the impatience of a man being asked whether the sky was above him.

“I can see the junction ridge behind me. I can hear the creek from Bowl One. I’m in Bowl One.”

“Copy,” I said, and my mouth went dry. “Hold.”

I turned to Tessa. “How many teams are out?”

“Two,” she said. “Plus Luis with his partner, **Mara Keene**.”

Mara was a paramedic who tracked with Luis because she was stubborn and fast and didn’t panic. If anything went wrong, Mara was the kind of person who would tie your life to hers without asking.

I breathed out slowly and tried to impose order.

“Okay,” I said. “We have three anomalies; Team One is ahead of schedule, Team One’s GPS breadcrumb has a gap, Luis is physically in one place but his coordinates plot in another.”

Casey looked pale. “Could be device error across the board.”

“Across different devices,” I said. “Different satellites, different users.”

In the field, when multiple instruments disagree, you default to the simplest explanation; human mistake. Misread junction, wrong ridge, miskeyed coordinate.

But Drew wasn’t a rookie. Luis was allergic to sloppy data. Casey’s equipment was checked and double-checked.

And then the radios picked up a voice that shouldn’t have been there at all.

It came over the search frequency, weak and crackling, like someone talking through a mouthful of water.

“Base… this is Caleb.”

Every hair on my arms stood up.

Casey’s eyes snapped to mine, and for a second neither of us moved. In the trailer, even the heater fan seemed too loud.

“Say again,” I said into the mic, and I hated how steady my voice sounded. I hated that it didn’t sound surprised, as if some part of me had already been expecting it.

The voice came again, clearer, and it made my stomach turn because it sounded tired.

“Base, this is Caleb. I’m… I’m at the creek. I can see the log. I can’t… I can’t find the trail back. It’s not—”

The signal broke into static.

I stared at the radio like it might grow hands and explain itself.

Casey whispered, “That’s not possible. We don’t have his frequency.”

We didn’t. Caleb wasn’t carrying one of our radios. Jillian hadn’t mentioned any handheld. Even if he had a cheap FRS set, he wouldn’t be on our channel unless he’d somehow matched it by accident.

Team One was at the creek crossing. Drew had just said so.

And now a voice claiming to be Caleb was saying he was at the creek crossing, unable to find the trail back.

“Drew,” I said immediately, “Team One, did you just transmit on search frequency?”

“No,” Drew replied, too fast. “We didn’t transmit. We’re holding. Evan, we’re… we’re hearing it too.”

“Copy,” I said.

The radio hissed. The forest outside remained indifferent.

I keyed up again, careful with the words. “Caleb, this is Base. If you can hear me, say your full name and describe what you see.”

Static. Then, faintly, “Caleb Rourke. There’s… water. The log. The dead tree. Someone’s yelling, but it’s… it’s like it’s far away even though it’s right there.”

His breath hitched, and the sound that followed was not a sob, not exactly, but the noise someone makes when they realize the world has stopped following rules.

“I can see the trail,” he whispered. “It’s right there. It’s right there, and it’s not…”

Static swallowed the rest.

Casey’s fingers flew over her console. “Signal origin,” she muttered. “Come on.”

She pulled up the directional antenna readings from our command unit. It gave a rough bearing when a transmission hit strong enough.

The bearing arrow pointed dead ahead.

Straight into the bowls.

I glanced at the map again. If Caleb’s last phone ping was near the second bowl, and he was now transmitting from the creek crossing, and Team One was already at the creek crossing, then either Caleb had doubled back faster than physics allowed, or someone was spoofing us, or we were hearing a recording.

Or, and I didn’t want to think it, the creek crossing wasn’t one place anymore.

I made a decision that felt like stepping onto ice.

“Team One,” I said, “approach the creek crossing slowly. Call out. Do not cross the log. Confirm if you hear a voice in person.”

Drew’s voice came back, low. “Copy.”

I switched channels to Luis. “Luis, Mara, I need you to move toward the creek crossing, but do it cautiously. Flag your route. If you lose visual on each other, stop.”

Mara answered instead of Luis, her voice clipped. “Copy, Evan. We’re moving.”

Tessa stepped closer to me, her face serious. “Do we call in more assets?”

“Not yet,” I said, though my stomach wanted to say yes to anything that felt like control. “Let’s verify before we escalate.”

The truth is, escalation in wilderness operations is still just people walking. More boots, more radio chatter, more fatigue. If something was wrong with distance itself, then adding more bodies might just add more variables.

I watched the clock.

At **3:18 PM**, Team One came back.

“Base,” Drew said, and his voice was different. Not panicked, but careful, like he’d stepped into a room where someone had been arguing.

“We’re at the creek.”

“Copy. Visual contact with subject?”

Silence, then: “Negative.”

“Do you hear anything?”

Another pause. “We can hear someone breathing. Not like… not like near us. Like it’s coming from the creek itself.”

I felt cold crawl up my ribs.

“Drew,” I said, “describe what you mean.”

He swallowed audibly. “It’s like the sound is inside the water. Like when you put your head under and you can hear the world muffled. That kind of sound. But the creek isn’t loud enough to hide it.”

Casey shook her head slowly, as if refusing.

Drew continued, “We called out. No response in person. But… Evan, the radio.”

“Go on.”

“It’s answering us,” he said, and the way he said it made my mouth go dry. “When we call out, the radio transmits back, but it’s delayed. Like an echo, except it’s words.”

My thoughts snagged on a memory of training; radio reflections, signal bounce, weird atmospheric conditions. But this wasn’t a mountain repeating static. This was language.

Casey leaned toward the mic. “Team One, ask the voice what time it is.”

Drew didn’t argue. He keyed up.

“Caleb,” Drew said, steady, like he was talking to a frightened person on a ledge. “What time is it?”

Static. Then, faint and breathy, Caleb’s voice.

“Four eighteen.”

My stomach dropped so hard it felt like I’d missed a step.

That was the time of the last phone ping.

Drew’s voice shook slightly. “Base, did you hear that?”

“I heard it,” I said.

Casey stared at her console as if it might confess.

Four eighteen. The last timestamp. The moment Caleb had stopped moving, at least as far as Jillian’s app could tell.

But it was barely past three now.

I forced myself to speak. “Drew, do not cross the log. Mark the area. Look for physical evidence; gear, clothing, tracks. Anything.”

“Copy,” Drew said, and I could tell he was relieved to be given tasks. Tasks are walls we build against the dark.

I turned to Casey. “Pull Jillian’s phone logs. Every ping. Every timestamp. I want the last hour in detail.”

Casey nodded, fingers moving.

Tessa looked at me. “Evan, what is this?”

I stared at the map, at the contour lines stacked tight where the land folded into bowls like hands closing.

“Either we’re dealing with technology error,” I said, and my voice sounded too small for the trailer, “or we’re dealing with a location that isn’t behaving like a location.”

At **3:41 PM**, Luis called.

“Base, Tracker One.”

“Go.”

Luis’s voice was low, and it carried that tone he used when he’d found something he didn’t want to name.

“We found a second bottle,” he said. “Same sticker. Same model. Same cap bite marks.”

“That’s impossible,” Casey whispered.

Luis added, “And Evan… it’s warm.”

Warm meant recently held. Warm meant skin contact.

“Location?” I asked.

Luis hesitated. “That’s the problem. It’s on the ridge above Bowl Two.”

“That’s miles from you,” I said.

“I know,” Luis replied, and he sounded angry now, angry the way a person sounds when their senses are being insulted. “We haven’t climbed. We’ve been moving downhill toward the creek. We should not be on any ridge.”

Mara cut in, her voice tight. “Evan, the trees changed.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“They’re wrong,” Mara said. “Same forest, but different. The moss is on the wrong side. The deadfall patterns aren’t consistent. It’s like we’re walking through a copy that got… arranged by someone who didn’t understand it.”

Her breathing was controlled, but I could hear the effort.

Luis’s voice came back. “We can see the creek below us, but it’s too far down. It wasn’t like this ten minutes ago.”

I pressed the heel of my hand to my forehead. “Stop moving. Flag your position. Take a bearing. Confirm with GPS.”

Casey’s console beeped softly. She looked at the screen, then at me, then back again.

“Evan,” she whispered, “Luis’s unit just jumped.”

“How far?”

She swallowed. “Three point two miles. In one update interval.”

No one covers three miles in thirty seconds.

I took the mic. “Luis, Mara, do you see the creek?”

“Yes,” Mara said quickly. “But it’s… it’s not lining up with the sound. It looks close, but it sounds far. The distance doesn’t match the way it feels.”

The words landed with a sick certainty.

Distance doesn’t match the way it feels.

That was not a technology error. That was a symptom.

I made another decision, and it tasted like metal.

“Luis,” I said, “do you have line of sight to the creek crossing log?”

A pause, then: “We might. It’s… hard to tell. The view is wrong.”

“Do not descend,” I said. “Hold where you are. Keep each other in sight. I’m sending Team Two to your bearing to establish a visual anchor.”

Team Two, led by **Nina Cho**, was on the ridge approach. If they could see Luis and Mara from above, then we could triangulate and restore reality through geometry.

At least, that’s what my brain told itself.

At **4:02 PM**, Jillian returned to the command trailer. Tessa had kept her occupied, fed her water, done the human things while I did the operational ones.

Jillian’s face was gray with exhaustion, but her eyes were bright with a desperate kind of focus.

“Any news?” she asked.

I weighed my words. You never lie to family. You also don’t hand them raw fear.

“We’re getting signals,” I said carefully. “We’re working toward a confirmation.”

She stepped closer. “His phone updated.”

Casey looked up sharply. “What?”

Jillian held out her phone. The dot had moved.

It was now at the creek crossing.

The timestamp said **4:18 PM**.

My blood went cold.

It was 4:03.

Jillian stared at me like I was the one who had done it. “How is it four eighteen?”

“It’s not,” I said, and the way the words came out, flat and absolute, seemed to frighten her more than any comforting lie could have.

Casey grabbed the phone, checked the network, checked the time settings. The phone time was correct. The app time was correct.

Only the location ping was wrong.

Or it was right, and our definition of “now” was the thing that had drifted.

The radio crackled again, and Caleb’s voice returned, clearer than before, like someone stepping closer to a window.

“Base,” he said, and he sounded calmer, which was worse. “I can see you.”

I froze.

Drew’s voice came instantly. “Caleb, where are you? We don’t see you.”

Caleb whispered, “You’re right there.”

Casey’s eyes darted to me, wide.

Caleb continued, and his voice had the dazed quality of someone describing something they didn’t have words for.

“I’m at the creek,” he said. “I’m on the log. I’m looking at all of you. You’re not… you’re not standing where you are.”

Drew’s voice sharpened. “Caleb, step off the log. Step back.”

A pause, then Caleb’s quiet, bewildered answer.

“I can’t. The log is longer than it should be.”

The trailer felt too small suddenly, as if the walls had moved closer.

Jillian made a sound behind me, a strangled breath.

I took the mic, because I needed my voice in the system, needed an anchor.

“Caleb,” I said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator. Listen to me carefully. Do you see the water? Do you see the dead snag on the right side?”

“Yes,” he said, and his voice shook at the edges. “But it’s… it’s looping. The water keeps meeting itself.”

I closed my eyes for a second, just long enough to feel the weight of my own heartbeat.

When I opened them, Casey was watching me like she was waiting for permission to be afraid.

“Caleb,” I said, “I need you to tell me something only you and Jillian would know.”

Jillian leaned forward, trembling.

Caleb’s voice came softly. “We went to that ramen place, the one with the paper lanterns. She made me try the soft egg even though I said it looked weird.”

Jillian’s hand flew to her mouth. Tears spilled instantly, silent and unstoppable.

It was him.

It was him, and he was talking to us from a place where the creek met itself and time was a circle you could step onto.

My mind tried to salvage a plan.

“Drew,” I said, “Team One, extend a line. Throw a rope to the log, but do not cross. Keep tension light. We’re not pulling. We’re giving him an anchor.”

Drew answered, “Copy.”

I switched to Team Two. “Nina, I need you to establish visual on Luis and Mara. Confirm if you can see their exact position. Give me bearings.”

“Copy,” Nina replied.

Everything moved at once after that, like we’d kicked a hive.

Team One secured a rope to a tree, tossed the coil. Drew narrated, voice tight but professional. The rope landed near the log.

“Caleb,” Drew called, “reach for the rope. Tie it around your waist if you can.”

Caleb’s breathing came through the radio like a tide. “It’s… it’s closer on your side than mine.”

“Reach anyway,” Drew said.

There was a sound then, a faint scraping, as if fabric had dragged across wood.

“I have it,” Caleb whispered, and Jillian sobbed aloud behind me, raw and involuntary.

Drew’s relief came through in a single exhale. “Good. Hold it. Don’t move.”

Caleb’s voice was suddenly very small. “Drew,” he said.

“How do you know my name?” Drew snapped, and then immediately sounded regretful.

Caleb didn’t answer the question. “Drew,” he said again, “you’re standing behind yourself.”

Drew went silent.

Then, in the background of Drew’s transmission, I heard something else, faint but unmistakable.

Another voice.

Drew’s voice, delayed, like an echo that had learned how to speak.

“Team One to Base,” the delayed voice said, “we’re at the creek crossing.”

Casey stared at me, horrified.

The radio was not bouncing. It was repeating, but not as a loop. As a second channel of reality that was slightly out of phase.

Nina called in, and her voice was sharp enough to cut.

“Base, Team Two. We have visual on Luis and Mara.”

“Copy,” I said quickly. “Confirm their position.”

There was a pause that felt like the air holding its breath.

Nina’s voice returned, lower. “Evan… we have visual on Luis and Mara, but…”

“But what?”

“There are two pairs,” she said, and the words came out like she didn’t want her mouth to form them. “Two positions. Same clothing. Same movements. Like a delayed mirror.”

My hands went numb on the map.

In the trailer, Jillian was shaking so hard the chair beneath her rattled.

I keyed up to Luis. “Luis, do you hear Team Two? They have visual on you.”

Luis’s response was immediate. “We can see them too,” he said, and his voice sounded strained, as if he’d been holding something heavy for too long. “But… Evan, there’s another Team Two.”

My stomach lurched.

Mara’s voice came, soft and urgent. “Evan, the forest just… stitched.”

“Explain,” I said, though I didn’t want the explanation.

Mara whispered, “The ridge line moved. It slid like fabric. There’s a seam.”

A seam.

That was the word.

I looked at the map, at the contour lines, at the bowls nested inside bowls. They had always looked like folded fabric, but I had never considered the possibility that they might actually behave like it.

Drew’s voice came again. “Base, rope tension changed.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s heavier,” Drew said, and I could hear the strain in his breathing. “Like someone grabbed the other end, but not Caleb. Like… like the rope is going somewhere else.”

“Caleb,” I said urgently, “are you holding the rope?”

“Yes,” Caleb whispered, but his voice sounded distant now, muffled, as if he’d stepped underwater. “Evan… I can see the trailhead from here.”

“That’s impossible,” I said, and the words felt useless.

Caleb continued, voice trembling. “I can see Jillian’s car. I can see you. You’re all standing by the trailer. You’re… you’re looking at maps. You’re…”

His breathing hitched. “Evan, you’re sitting at the table, and you’re also walking into the trees.”

My heart hammered once, hard.

I wasn’t in the woods. I hadn’t left the trailer.

I had been at the trailer the whole time.

I tightened my grip on the microphone until my fingers ached.

“Caleb,” I said, forcing the words to sound like procedure, “tell me what I’m wearing.”

Caleb’s voice became oddly calm, like someone who has stopped trying to fight the shape of things.

“You’re wearing your red search jacket,” he said. “The one with the tape on the shoulder. You have a coffee stain on the chest, and you don’t notice it until later.”

A cold wave rolled through me.

I looked down at my jacket.

Red. Search patch. Tape on the shoulder from a repair I’d never bothered to redo properly.

And a coffee stain, dark and crescent-shaped, right where my hand had been resting, hidden by the map until this moment.

I had spilled coffee on myself this morning. I hadn’t looked down.

Caleb’s voice went softer. “Evan… the rope is… it’s going into the water, but the water is… it’s like it has depth that doesn’t belong to it.”

Drew swore under his breath, and then his voice snapped back into professionalism like it was the only thing keeping him upright.

“Base, we’re seeing the rope line sink.”

“Sinking?” I repeated.

“It’s going down,” Drew said, and his breathing was harsh. “Not into the creek. Into… into the reflection.”

Into the reflection.

Option three, the misalignment, made real in my mind like a nightmare deciding to obey the laws of physics just long enough to hurt you.

Jillian stood up abruptly, chair scraping. “Caleb!” she shouted, and her voice cracked. “Caleb, I’m here!”

Caleb responded immediately, but his words weren’t to her. They were to me, and they were barely more than a breath.

“Evan,” he said, “I can hear you calling my name from earlier.”

My mouth went dry. “Earlier today?”

Caleb’s voice trembled. “No. Earlier than today. It’s… it’s like the sound has been waiting here.”

A sound waiting.

A call that arrived before it was made.

I thought of the 4:18 timestamp sitting in Jillian’s app like a fixed point, like a nail hammered into time.

I thought of the breadcrumb gaps, the coordinate jumps, the duplicated teams on ridges.

I thought of Mara’s seam.

I forced myself to do the only thing I knew how to do when the world stopped behaving; I tried to simplify.

“Drew,” I said, “do not pull. Keep rope tension steady. Caleb, do not step forward. Do not step back. If you can, sit.”

Caleb whispered, “I already did.”

Then, in the background, under the hiss, under the creek sound that should not have carried through a radio, I heard something that made my blood turn to ice.

My own voice.

Not live, not from the trailer, but thin and distorted like it had been recorded on cheap tape.

“Caleb,” the recorded Evan said, “this is Evan Alder. I’m the incident coordinator.”

It was the exact phrase I had used earlier, the same cadence, the same professional calm.

Only the timestamp in Jillian’s app flickered, and for a split second it read **4:18 PM**, then **4:18 PM** again, as if it couldn’t decide which reality it wanted to belong to.

Casey’s eyes were wide, wet with terror she hadn’t let herself feel yet.

“What is happening,” she mouthed.

And outside the trailer, somewhere beyond the parking lot, beyond the first mile of trail, beyond the bowls folding into themselves like hands closing, the radio cracked once more and Caleb whispered the last thing I ever heard him say, a sentence that sounded like a man realizing he had already crossed a line he never saw.

“It’s closing,” he said softly, “but it’s closing around the part of me that already came back, and I can feel the distance pulling like a muscle, and Evan, I think I’m about to arrive where I started, except when I look at the trailhead now, the trailer is already packed up, Jillian is already gone, and you’re walking into the trees with my red beanie in your hand like you-”",2,1769481701.0,horrorstories,0,1.0,False
1qo1f7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1qo1f7d/what_the_bleep_do_you_mean_by_just_be_the_person/,What the BLEEP do you mean by JUST BE the person???,"You hear coaches say in the comments all the time: ""Just be the person who already has it.""

And there is always the same response: ""What does that even mean? I *am* being the person, I'm doing all the things!""

So let me break down what we actually mean by that.

**You are not manifesting the thing. You are manifesting a version of yourself that has the thing.   You are shifting your identity.**

The SP, the money, the body—whatever it is—that's not what you are manifesting. You are shifting your identity. Your state (Your state of being). A version of you where having that “thing” is completely normal and natural.

**And here's the key: everything flows from your state.**

Your state of being holds a set of beliefs and assumptions → those beliefs create your thoughts and feelings → those thoughts and feelings create your behaviours and reactions.

So when I say ""be the person,"" I'm not telling you to fake it or pretend. I'm telling you to occupy the state. Because when you change your state, everything else automatically shifts as a byproduct.  You don't need to flip your thoughts all day. You don't need to fix your feelings. You don’t need to “detach”.  All you have to do is shift your state. 

Think about it this way: right now, you have a coffee mug. Do you wake up affirming ""I have a coffee mug""? Do you monitor your thoughts about the mug? No. Because the version of you that has it doesn't think about it. It's just NORMAL.

**That's the state you are manifesting**

The person who has money doesn't anxiously check their bank account. The person in a loving relationship doesn't spiral over unanswered texts. The person with their dream body doesn't stand in the mirror picking apart every flaw.

Why? Because those reactions don't come from that state. Your reactions are actually the biggest tell of what state you are in.

**When you're truly in the state of having it, you react as someone who has it. Naturally.**

It's not about walking around pretending. It's about recognising that in imagination (aka consciousness) is the only reality that actually matters—that you are already being that person.

That version of you already exists. You are not creating it from scratch. You are choosing it. You are shifting into it.

When you fully occupy that state…   FULLY..   That's when you will naturally stop wavering between ""I have it"" and ""I'm waiting for it"". Because your behaviours will change

Remember—**there is no one to change but self!**

I managed to film everything and we were there for about an hour and a half. Only a Popeyes, 2 collectors shops, the Macy’s, Barnes and Noble, and a few outlet stores were left. Some lights were flickering on and off, and the escalators weren’t operating. I went to VHS and spoke with (I’m assuming) the manager and he was very kind and personable. He told a story of how the mall became what it is now and how he’s been surviving there from a business standpoint. He also said he does YouTube so if any of you are familiar with his channel, I will gladly give him a shoutout. Same with Hidden Treasures. The worker there even gave me a tour of the memorabilia he had. I feel bad not buying anything from either store. In terms of the vacant spaces, they were dark, dirty, and looked abandoned. There was also a mini stand on the first floor with a safe, but did not take it. The floor pattern in the middle of the mall was absolutely beautiful and it’s a shame it’s being wasted. The Auntie Anne’s in the food court had a pretzel mark in the counter, and the Burger King sign was missing. A few lights in the Macy’s were flickering too. A lot of the chair cushions around the mall were dingy and in poor condition. Ripped up and bumpy. Someone also left half of a hot coffee on the table. The play area looked like a dump. The floor was soft and cushiony and the seats were all torn and ripped up. All and all, this is a mall I would love to go back to but I don’t at the same time. With the people I spoke to there, it gives you the perspective of those who struggle to make it by and live through small business. I truly wish life was different for people like this because they deserve better. I could only imagine what this mall was like in its heyday, and because of this, I have an odd love for this mall now. And because I discovered this mall, maybe once I graduate I could find time to explore other abandoned or dead places in New Jersey. Ok, enough of my rambling, if anyone would like to share their perspective with this mall, please do. I’d love to hear!",2,1769481504.0,newjersey,0,0.67,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

* Grandma coerced the child to greet him, and 'asked' the child if he was a stranger, to which the child said yes.
* Grandma proceeded to override this and then make her perform the Stranger Danger mantra she taught the child for praise
* At Christmas, the child was afraid of Santa and proceeded to jump into the nanny's arms
* Grandparents did not like this 'negative emotion' and proceeded to cheer her up immediately because they cannot tolerate negative emotions
* An Aunt, A, broke up with her boyfriend, B.
* My bf and spawn's mother were discussing it
* Spawn asked, ""What are you talking about?"" repeatedly.
* Spawn's mother proceeded to tell her, ""Aunty A and Uncle B are no longer together.""

*Hey all, this one might not be relevant for everyone, but if you're prepping for mid-senior, senior, or staff-level loops in tech, you might find this helpful.*

Over the years, I’ve watched people who are effectively operating at L6 or even L7, come out of interview loops calibrated at L5.

When you read the feedback, it’s almost always about scope of work. Their scope is substantial, but that’s not what comes through in their answers.

Your interviewer doesn’t know the complexity of your org chart or how many hurdles you cross everyday. They only hear what you choose to surface in a few stories.

In practice, level is inferred indirectly - from the kinds of decisions you describe, how you talk about ownership, how wide your influence shows up, and whether you surface real trade-offs and business impact.

If those signals doesn’t come through clearly, the default assumption is L5 scope, even when your technical rounds are stellar.

The infographic below breaks down the exact signals interviewers consciously or subconsciously use to infer level. It gives you a quick way to sanity-check whether your stories are actually signaling L6/L7, or downgrading you quietly.

Right now it can:

* Log shots (dose, yield, time, grind, machine, beans)
* Show your brew history over time
* Make it easier to see what changed when a shot got better or worse

I loved the show and finished it within few days, but the >!Do rami thing and the constant back and forth in the second half!< was a bit annoying for me. 

I liked the first half the most, the cute and romantic moments between the leads, the funny scenes and dialogues, the awkwardness all of it. The scene where they go to the market together (in Canada) after falling asleep in the hotel lobby is one of my favourites. When Ho jin finally starts warming up towards Mu hee, falling for her and can't hide it anymore. Its soo cute and comforting to watch. I couldn't stop smiling throughout the show. I liked how their dynamic was so comfortable from the beginning, they were like good friends who deeply cared about each other and loved each other's company. I loved the cinematography and the escapist vibe the show had (first half). I want something like this to watch without the >!split personality storyline and constant back and forth !<obviously. I think I liked the feeling of escapism in the first half, and the second half took me out of it a bit. 

  
I have seen coffee prince and like it for similar reasons: very strong chemistry between the leads, with swoonworthy and cute moments. It was such a fun watch as well.

Liked business proposal too, it was so enjoyable, but the chemistry between the leads wasn't as strong imo, or maybe i am just biased because Kim Seon Ho is unbeatable for me as romantic lead.

I've seen hometown cha cha cha, and liked a few eps, but I found the show to be boring overall and there was no plot as such.

I have also seen her private life, was good but the last few eps were a bit boring and it dragged on.

1qo169l,https://www.reddit.com/r/focusedmen/comments/1qo169l/the_psychology_behind_why_you_set_goals_but_never/,The psychology behind why you set goals but never hit them (and how to actually follow through),"Look, we've all been there. January 1st rolls around, you're pumped about your new goals, maybe even bought a fancy planner. Fast forward to March and that planner's collecting dust while you're doom scrolling at 2am wondering why you can't stick to anything.

I spent way too much time thinking I just sucked at discipline. Turns out, most of us are setting goals completely wrong. After going down a research rabbit hole (books, podcasts, behavioral science papers), I realized the problem isn't willpower. It's that nobody taught us how goal setting actually works in our monkey brains.

Here's what I learned:

**Your goals are probably way too vague**

Saying ""I want to get fit"" or ""I want to read more"" is like telling your brain ""figure it out yourself."" Your brain hates ambiguity. It needs specifics.

Instead of ""exercise more,"" try ""10 pushups every morning before coffee."" The smaller and more specific, the better. James Clear talks about this a ton in *Atomic Habits*. He's a behavioral psychology nerd who broke down why tiny changes actually stick. This book sold over 15 million copies for a reason. It'll make you rethink everything about how habits form. Seriously one of the most practical books I've read on behavior change.

The magic isn't in the goal itself but in designing a system that makes the behavior inevitable. You're not relying on motivation (which is flaky as hell), you're building a structure.

**You're fighting against your environment**

Your willpower is limited. Like, scientifically proven limited. So why are we constantly setting ourselves up to fight against it?

If you want to eat healthier but your pantry is stocked with chips, you're making it unnecessarily hard. If you want to write but your desk faces TikTok-laden phone, good luck.

BJ Fogg's *Tiny Habits* dives deep into this. He's a Stanford behavior scientist who spent 20+ years studying how behavior actually changes. The book won multiple awards and his method is used by companies like Google. His main point? Make the behavior easier than not doing it. Want to floss? Put the floss right next to your toothbrush. Want to journal? Leave your journal on your pillow.

I started using an app called **Forfeit** that charges you real money if you don't hit your goal. Sounds harsh but it works because loss aversion is powerful. You can set it to donate to a charity you hate if you skip your habit. The stakes make it real.

**You're trying to change too much at once**

Multi tasking is a myth. So is changing five habits simultaneously. Your brain has limited bandwidth for behavior change.

Research from University College London found it takes an average of 66 days to form a new habit. Not 21 days like everyone claims. And that's for ONE habit. Stack five habits on top of each other and you're setting yourself up to fail.

Pick one thing. Just one. Master it for two months before adding anything else. 

Cal Newport talks about this in *Deep Work*. He's a computer science professor who studies productivity and focus. The book became a bestseller in like 20 countries because it cuts through all the productivity BS. His argument? Our brains aren't wired for constant context switching. Focus on one deep thing at a time or you'll accomplish nothing meaningful.

**You're not tracking properly**

What gets measured gets managed. Sounds corporate but it's true.

I use **Habitica** which gamifies your habits. You get XP and level up by completing tasks. Sounds dorky but making it game like tricks your brain's reward system. You can also try **Streaks** if you're more minimalist.

If reading all these books feels overwhelming, there's **BeFreed**, an AI learning app built by Columbia University grads and ex-Google engineers. You type in what you're struggling with, like ""stick to my fitness goals as someone who hates routine"" or ""build better habits with ADHD,"" and it pulls from books, behavioral science research, and expert insights to create personalized audio content and a structured learning plan tailored specifically to your situation. You can choose between a quick 10-minute overview or go deeper with 40-minute episodes packed with examples and practical strategies. Plus you can customize the voice, from a calm, grounding tone to something more energetic to keep you engaged during your commute or workout.

The philosopher podcast *The Daily Stoic* with Ryan Holiday has great episodes on habit tracking too. He breaks down ancient Stoic practices that are basically early versions of habit tracking. Marcus Aurelius was literally journaling his daily actions 2000 years ago.

**You're not being honest about your why**

Deep down, why do you actually want this goal? Not the surface level reason. The real one.

""I want to lose weight"" isn't a strong enough why. ""I want to lose weight so I can play with my kids without getting winded"" or ""I want to feel confident in my body again"" hits different.

Brené Brown researches shame and vulnerability at University of Houston. Her book *The Gifts of Imperfection* isn't specifically about goals but it'll make you examine why you're chasing certain things. Is it because YOU want them or because you think you should want them? That distinction matters more than you think.

**You give up after one slip**

Missing one day doesn't erase your progress. But we treat it like it does. You skip the gym once and suddenly you've ""failed"" and might as well quit entirely.

That's called all or nothing thinking and it's toxic. Progress isn't linear. You're going to mess up. The goal is to mess up less over time, not to be perfect.

This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending everything's easy. Behavior change is genuinely hard because you're literally rewiring neural pathways. But it's also doable if you stop fighting against how your brain actually works and start designing systems that work with it.",1,1769481041.0,focusedmen,0,1.0,False

There’s a guy a my local brew-pub who works back of house, and he sometimes fills in serving. 

\~A month ago he brought something outside to my brother and and struck up a conversation, asking if my brother remembered him, which he vaguely did. Pub guy is probably 36, like my brother, I surmise. Cool.



My brother was a shit head for a while (drugs, gang) and this guy is likely referring to that period, but was super nice. So I’m immediately liking his ability to show grace and all. Seems cool. Love that for the pub in general. Solid vibe for the space. 

Couple weeks ago I had just gotten updated glasses and noticed him looking cute with a fresh haircut from afar doing brewing related stuff. Wasn‘t staring. But I did look. Not really in a position to be chatted up, busy, and I’m not usually shooting my shot with potentially straight guys. 

Today I met up with a gal pal and arrived ahead of time to grab a good table for lunch. He brought out my food (blt w/avacado and a side of fries) and paused after I made eye contact and thanked him, sort of did a half turn, and said he really likes my look. I thanked him and said “I really appreciate that!” Made good eye contact, but had to break a couple of times for being a little overwhelmed. 

I wasn’t dressed up, but I wasn’t trying to make my girlie look lame if anyone was looking. 

  
Lunch “date” says I should ask him for coffee on a lunch break sometime and be explicit that it’s as friends. I’m not sure if that’s direct enough, but I’m also Demisexual and a bit of a side, so I don’t want to put out the wrong signals by being overly forward either…but I did, uhm, feel a physiological reaction which is \*very\* rare for me. And my gut is to strike while the iron is hot- before someone snatches him up. 

  
I know what I want to do, but I’m not sure how to do it. My area is rural, and as my brother says, this is our preferred watering hole. 

  
What do y’all think about it? How would you proceed? 

PS, he was outside smoking when my friend and I left, and I was sure to call her bro and fist bump her goodbye.

*Hey all, this one might not be relevant for everyone, but if you're prepping for mid-senior, senior, or staff-level loops, you might find this helpful.*

Over the years, I’ve watched people who are effectively operating at L6 or even L7, come out of interview loops calibrated at L5.

When you read the feedback, it’s almost always about scope of work. Their scope is substantial, but that’s not what comes through in their answers.

Your interviewer doesn’t know the complexity of your org chart or how many hurdles you cross everyday. They only hear what you choose to surface in a few stories.

In practice, level is inferred indirectly - from the kinds of decisions you describe, how you talk about ownership, how wide your influence shows up, and whether you surface real trade-offs and business impact.

If those signals doesn’t come through clearly, the default assumption is L5 scope, even when your technical rounds are stellar.

The infographic below breaks down the exact signals interviewers consciously or subconsciously use to infer level. It gives you a quick way to sanity-check whether your stories are actually signaling L6/L7, or downgrading you quietly.

I live with my BF, our two cats, and a few reptiles (he’s breeding snakes as a hobby). He works full-time as a delivery driver while I work “full-time” at a grocery store, yet my hours fluctuate.

I STRUGGLE with keeping up with chores. I feel I have base-layer chores done (dishes, trash, cat litter, feeding animals, regular vacuuming, etc.) but everything else I either forget or have the roughest time doing.

A list of things to vent about:

\- Cleaning bedsheets: we wash them when we really need to. Our apartment complex only has 2 washers and 2 dryers for the whole unit and it costs quite a bit to run. I try my best to keep shit clean but sometimes it goes untouched for waaaaaay too long

\- Cleaning my bath mat. It’s gross but cleaned enough for my feet to stay cleaned. I always throw clean water over it and just let it dry out but man it can sometimes get a little too gross

\- Full-cleaning litter boxes (as in full washing). Granted my cats’ paws are always cleaned and I deep-scape when I do litter, but it’s been a year since it’s had a full clean-out

\- Truly cleaning inside of reptile tanks. I scoop poop often (like biweekly since they do not poop a lot/need it to bake to clean up) but the actual full clean of tanks can sometimes be hard. It’s a day chore in of itself that I do not have time for

\- Fully cleaning dust everywhere. Like fuck me for not touching something and it still gets “dirty.”

\- Washing out my coffee maker. Haven’t touched it in forever, and it’s probably gross af

\- Cleaning the microwave ceiling. Food exploded on the top of it and a wet paper towel is doing nothing

Like how tf am I supposed to keep up with cleaning everything, have a full time job, and also keep up with my own mental health. I’ve been so burnt out that I’m lashing out from being so tired.

Hey, I bought a large slab of Huon pine while in Tasmania.

It’s 1540 × 630 × 40 mm (approx. 61 × 25 × 1.5 inches).

I want to turn it into a coffee table with a fairly natural, untouched look. My plan was to sand the slab faces and edges with 80 -> 120 -> 180 -> 240 -> 320 grit, wetting and re-sanding at each stage from 180 onwards. Then I would wipe it down with mineral turps, wait 24 hours, and apply a couple of coats of Danish oil.

I will buy simple black metal legs from a hardware shop.

Is this a good approach? I’ve read other forum posts about this wood where people go to a much higher grit, at least 600 and sometimes up to 1200. I thought that might close the pores and stop the oil being absorbed properly.

Has anyone worked with this wood before? It seems like it has some unique properties with all the oil (methyl eugenol).

I know that sounds absolutely horrible but I don’t have any other way to explain it. I have been seeing a therapist and have enacted some changes to try to help but I don’t feel like it’s really changing and I don’t know what else to do. 

I am extremely limited on options. My child’s father recently commit DV against me, so I can’t ask him for help. My parents are unreliable. I don’t have the money to get more sitting than I already do. 

Right now our schedule is packed and I feel like I can’t find any other opportunities for me time and I also feel   Immeasurable guilt and shame that what I already have is not enough. 

I get Saturdays from 10am to Sunday 10am each week. That is my only non working child free time, but that is still more than most other single parents get, so why can’t I make do? 

I wake up at 5am every morning to have coffee on my own and get my head right before starting my day (therapist suggestion) then sign into work 6am until my son wakes. I get him ready and take him to school and then work until 3, do meal prep and cleaning from 3-3:30 and then grab him from school. 

Mondays we eat then go to soccer practice, have a snack and play for about 30 minutes then bed. Tuesday and Thursday we go directly to speech and occupational therapy, come home, eat, he gets independent play time while I clean and then bedtime routine. Mondays and Fridays, we go from school to my gym so I can get a 1 hour work out for my mental and physical health, he is in kid care (this I added after working with my therapist). Saturdays I get him off to his paternal grandma) and the work out m, clean the house and then crash. If I have energy I will go out for a drink or two because I get next to no social interaction even working (remote and basically a 1 woman department). 

When my son goes to bed, I’ll usually read for an hour if I can but usually after I shower I can’t keep my eyes open. 

I have considered getting a cleaner so I could spend less time cleaning but I can’t afford it. I was told to get a babysitter but i can hardly afford that either and feel like it’s not right to spend any more time away from my child than I already do. 

The only other suggestion I have gotten is to take time off of work here and there when he is in daycare so I can have more me time. I can’t do that very frequently though. On top of all of this I have a lot of pressure to perform at work because I am the sole provider for my son financially because his dad refused to pay child support. 

How do people do this? 

I thought the other day, man… maybe I need to go to a mental institution for a bit. But then I realized I can’t even do that without my child becoming a ward of the state temporarily. I have spent more than 24 consecutive hours away from my child in 2 years. 

I am going to keep going because I have no choice but how do I stop the constant cycle of  burnout? ",8,1769480611.0,SingleParents,13,1.0,False

My life has changed a lot. After dealing with a few power outages, I learned a couple of things.

When I was renting, any problem was basically the landlord’s issue. I didn’t want to invest much into a place I might only live in for a year. If my phone died during the power outage, I’d charge it in the car or at a coffee shop. If the internet went out, I’d just call it an early night.

Once I owned a home, everything changed. Comfort, safety, and having reliable power became my responsibility. We had a few outages shortly after moving in. I was always worried about running out of water and food, losing phone or internet access, not being able to cook, and the sump pump in the basement shutting off. I knew I had to prepare for all of these myself. Recently, I started keeping extra water and some canned food on hand. Also, I picked up a Coleman propane camp stove, a Bluetti power station, a Mr. Heater portable propane heater, a carbon monoxide detector, and a Petzl headlamp. During the recent outage, this setup let me keep basic lighting, cook food, stay warm, and not worry about running out of water or food.

Just a reminder for new homeowners like me: don’t just focus on furniture and decor. Emergency gear like this matters more than you think.",61,1769480542.0,preppers,4,0.92,False

Nah… this is the only seat I miss now,"I always pay extra or reserve early for window seats coz I love staring out, getting lost in thoughts during long hauls—it’s my thing that makes flying fun. This was the first time I didn’t get one, and in the moment I was kinda bummed… but looking back, best “miss” ever lol.

I travel tons for work and actually enjoy it. When I’m out, I hit pubs, explore cities, party a bit, but never been into random drunk hookups or drama. Never really felt that proper click with anyone… until this Emirates flight from Dubai to Sydney.

Got talking to one of the cabin crew—turns out she’s Mallu too. Instant vibe over language, food, naadan stuff, home memories. She was chill and open. Mid-flight she just drops that she has a crush on me. I was like… enthaada ithu? Couldn’t process. I’m alright looking but nothing wow, and she’s proper stunning in that uniform. Kept it cool, just said coffee in Sydney after landing?

Landed around 11pm, she had duties, so quick bye at airport. Next day before her return, we squeezed in a short coffee. She opened up a lot—said she’s married, has a 4yo son, shared about life, shifts, everything. Proper deep convo, felt real nice. Didn’t push anything physical, first meet and all, wanted her comfy. Swapped Telegram, but she said probably won’t message. Felt a bit down but respected it and moved on.

Then 3 months later, out of nowhere she texts. Says she’s rostered to Melbourne, full night layover, wants to meet. Didn’t even blink—booked same-day flight to Mel to be there.

Picked her up, straight to hotel… and yeah, 3 months of built-up tension just went boom. Insane night, no regrets then.

It’s been 3 weeks now, I miss her bad. Decided I’ll only reply if she reaches out, keep it respectful, no pressure or drama.

Part of me feels guilty af—like I’m enabling something that could wreck her family life. But another part thinks… she’s choosing this as an adult, we’re both consenting, I’m not trying to break her marriage or anything. Is it okay to just enjoy the moments when they come?

No idea how long this lasts or if it’s even doable long-term. Right now it’s this mix of thrill, excitement, and lowkey guilt.

Any of you been in similar situations? How do you deal with the guilt vs the connection? Or am I just straight-up being selfish here?

Very confused about my current issues not being able to lose weight. I (25M) have been trying to lose about 30 pounds for going on two years now. I have tried everything. I have been to a weight loss clinic and showed them my food logs and they said I was eating great and told me there was not much I could improve and kind of just didn't know what to say to account for my lack of weight loss. I had my BMR measured by an RMR machine and it measured my BMR at 2550 calories. I was suggested by a nutritionist (who I consulted with before going to the weight loss clinic) to try eating at 2500 calories, which I did. Didn't lose anything. The nutritionist then slowly brought my calories down until I was eating 1900 calories.  I upped my protein intake to \~150 g a day. Still nothing. I have cut out all soda (I only drank diet soda anyways), tracked all coffee intake (I know that coffee can contribute too! I don't drink coffee a lot, but when I do I choose sugar free/low calorie options 95% of the time), tracked all sauces and oils (I don't actually use oil that much anyways), and track every little snack that I eat (e.g. if I have 3 cheez its, I track them, no cheating!)

I average 9k steps a day, work out 4x a week (split 2 days cardio only, 2 days weight training: one upper body day and one lower body day). For about a 3 week test period I tried working out 6 days a week to see if that could help but realized it was pretty unsustainable so I went back to 4 days a week. Also haven't seen any changes in waist/chest measurements which I track regularly.

I have had countless blood tests. My A1c, fasting glucose, insulin, TSH, T3, T4, testosterone, cholesterol and lipids are all normal (ruling out some metabolic causes). Only things that were abnormal were vitamin D which was low and HDL which was also just *slightly* low but I don't think that explains much? (Although open to suggestions)

Despite all this, I have not only *not lost weight* in the year and a half I have been doing this, but I have in fact gained 10-12 pounds. I'm just sitting here wondering what in the world am I doing wrong and is there anything that can help me? Only thing I can think of is stress? I started a PhD program about 2.5 years ago, and so even though I get good sleep and don't *feel* stressed most of the time, the work is undoubtedly objectively stressful and so maybe that could contribute?

Total BS.



Real simplification isn't aesthetic. It's cognitive. Your brain processes 34 gigabytes of information daily, according to research from UC San Diego. Most of that is useless noise. After diving deep into behavioral science, neuroscience research, and honestly way too many podcasts at 2x speed, I realized we're all drowning in decision fatigue without even knowing it.



Here's what actually moved the needle when I started cutting the fat.



Stop doomscrolling social media. Not just ""use it less,"" actually delete the apps. Dr. Cal Newport's [Digital Minimalism](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Minimalism-Choosing-Focused-Noisy/dp/0525536515/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=148342404368&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.KMFXBtkkAz1iNm6nbiLfUGui_lj3CkzlGKRSomt0aPOcOMtr6EV_J2CllGxMwfixaS4JCxg5c-SWYHWgBM9c229rwIcRN5fZlz-sRc9aYIInLBqg0aMnOcTQ0KC-OelPMxtojX0v9Euz5TPs5yJiw-vcxetBetxb_NPvAe8n1twidzpmfPuX-Jt-IDz_dwqvOupUsh8M11riuG7fwIe4vsLMz5StDpu6n8X6CSZVWaU.5F0yRhyK60KUp3qeFTvTSKKA1HtCZpVVVJYNSR0lmYs&dib_tag=se&hvadid=630178937218&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=1011157&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=18307645059878806652&hvtargid=kwd-329828826609&hydadcr=7079_13292556&keywords=digital+minimalism&mcid=1273e7c863d731109c35513bb1eb1843&qid=1769414447&sr=8-1) (NYT bestseller, MIT computer science professor) breaks down how these platforms hijack your dopamine system. The book made me realize I was basically a lab rat pressing a lever for random rewards. Neuroscience backs this up, your prefrontal cortex literally weakens when you're constantly context switching between feeds. I kept LinkedIn for professional stuff, ditched the rest. First week sucked. Second week I finished two books I'd been ""reading"" for months.



Quit trying to optimize everything. Peak irony in a post about simplification, I know. But there's actual research on this. Barry Schwartz's [The Paradox of Choice](https://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Choice-Why-More-Less/dp/0060005696) explores how too many options paralyze us. Every decision, from which coffee to buy to which productivity app to download, depletes your willpower. I stopped researching the ""best"" anything for more than 10 minutes. Good enough became good enough. Freed up insane amounts of mental bandwidth.



Cut out toxic productivity culture. This one's huge. I used to wake up at 5am, do cold plunges, journal, meditate, all because some LinkedIn bro said that's what successful people do. Then I read Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkeman (insanely good read, completely shifts how you think about time management). The premise is brutal but freeing. You have roughly 4,000 weeks on earth. Stop trying to ""win"" at productivity. You'll never clear your to-do list. You'll never ""catch up."" Once I accepted that, I stopped forcing routines that made me miserable.



Stop multitasking. Neuroscience is clear on this, multitasking doesn't exist. Your brain just switches tasks really fast, and poorly. MIT neuroscientist Earl Miller's research shows you lose up to 40% efficiency when task switching. I started using the Centered app for single-tasking work sessions. It uses AI to block distractions and plays focus music. Sounds gimmicky but it genuinely works. My deep work sessions went from fragmented chaos to actually productive.



Quit the news cycle. Not all news, just the constant feed of catastrophe. Media profits from your anxiety. There's a reason ""if it bleeds, it leads"" is a journalism saying. I switched to reading one long-form article per week from The Atlantic or similar, and checking headlines once daily. Rolf Dobelli's Stop Reading the News argues most news is irrelevant, toxic, and actively makes you worse at thinking. He's right. I'm significantly less anxious and exactly zero percent less informed about things that actually matter.



Delete unused apps. Sounds obvious but researchers from University of Virginia found that even seeing app icons on your phone triggers micro-decisions about whether to open them. Those micro-decisions add up. I went from 80+ apps to about 20. Everything else lives in my browser if I desperately need it.



Stop saying yes to everything. Essentialism by Greg McKeown (Silicon Valley consultant, worked with Google, Apple, Salesforce) is essentially a 300-page argument for saying no. The most successful people aren't those who do the most, they're those who do less but better. Started asking ""Is this essential?"" before committing. My calendar went from panic-inducing to manageable.



Quit forcing morning routines. Related to productivity culture but worth separating. Your chronotype (natural sleep-wake cycle) is partially genetic. Dr. Michael Breus's research shows about 50% of people aren't morning people, they're evening types or somewhere in between. Forcing a 5am routine when you're biologically wired to peak at 2pm is self-sabotage. I shifted my deep work to when my brain actually functions. Revolutionary, I know.



Stop buying ""aspirational"" stuff. Books I'll never read. Gym equipment that becomes a coat rack. Courses I'll never finish. All of it feeds the fantasy version of yourself while cluttering your actual life. There's behavioral economics research showing we overestimate our future free time and motivation by absurd margins. I started the ""one in, one out"" rule. Want a new book? Donate one first. Keeps the clutter from creeping back.



Speaking of books you'll actually finish, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is a smart learning app built by Columbia University alumni that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized audio content. You type in what you want to work on, like ""simplify my life without toxic productivity,"" and it builds you a custom learning plan.



The customization is solid. Pick a 10-minute summary if you're short on time or go for a 40-minute deep dive with real examples when something clicks. The voice options matter more than you'd think, there's everything from calm and soothing to sarcastic and engaging. Since most listening happens during commutes or chores anyway, having a voice that doesn't grate on you makes a difference. Way easier than forcing yourself through books that sit half-read.



Quit arguing online. Zero exceptions. Nobody has ever won an internet argument or changed someone's deeply held beliefs via Twitter thread. The Ash app actually helped here, it's like a personal mental health coach that helps you recognize unhealthy patterns. When I'd feel that urge to correct someone being wrong on the internet, the app's check-ins made me pause and realize I was just feeding my ego. Not worth the cortisol spike.



Stop tracking every metric. Steps, calories, sleep scores, productivity points. I was spending more time analyzing my life than living it. There's research suggesting over-monitoring can actually increase anxiety and decrease intrinsic motivation. Kept basic health tracking, ditched the obsessive stuff. Turns out you can tell if you're healthy without knowing your REM cycle percentage.



Quit comparing timelines. Instagram makes everyone's life look like a highlight reel. But even beyond social media, we compare. ""I should be promoted by now."" ""They bought a house at 28, why haven't I?"" Comparison is cognitive poison. Dr. Laurie Santos's Yale course (most popular in university history) on happiness emphasizes this. Your timeline is yours. Someone else's success isn't your failure.



Stop overthinking everything. Analysis paralysis is real and it's exhausting. I read Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman (Nobel Prize winner in economics) and realized most decisions don't need System 2 thinking, our slow analytical brain. What to eat for lunch? System 1, quick and intuitive. Your gut is right more than you think for low-stakes stuff.



Quit toxic relationships. Not just romantic ones. Friends who drain you. Family members who diminish you. Coworkers who undermine you. Dr. Emma Seppälä's research at Stanford shows social stress is one of the biggest predictors of poor health outcomes. It's not selfish to distance yourself from people who make your life worse. It's self-preservation.



Stop consuming content passively. YouTube autoplay, Netflix binges, scrolling TikTok. All engineered to keep you hooked. I switched to intentional consumption only. Want to watch something? Decide what, then watch it. No autoplay. The [Opal app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/opal-screen-time-control/id1497465230) helps block distracting sites and apps during focus time, super customizable and actually respects that you're an adult making choices.



Quit perfectionism in daily tasks. Emails don't need to be perfectly worded. Your bed doesn't need hospital corners. Dinner doesn't need to be Instagram-worthy. Brené Brown's research on perfectionism shows it's strongly correlated with depression and anxiety. Good enough is actually good enough for like 90% of life tasks.



Stop forcing hobbies. I used to guilt myself into hobbies I thought I ""should"" enjoy. Reading classic literature. Learning guitar. Running marathons. If it feels like a chore, it's not a hobby, it's another obligation. Dr. Stuart Brown's research on play shows adults need genuinely enjoyable leisure, not performative self-improvement disguised as fun.



Quit the guilt around rest. Rest isn't earned. You don't need to ""deserve"" a break. Your worth isn't tied to productivity. Dr. Alex Soojung-Kim Pang's Rest explores how the most creative, successful people throughout history were masters of rest, not just work. Darwin worked four hours daily. Rest is when your brain consolidates learning and generates insights.



Stop keeping up appearances. The car, the clothes, the curated life. Nobody cares as much as you think. Research on the ""spotlight effect"" shows we overestimate how much others notice or care about us by huge margins. I started dressing for comfort, driving my paid off car into the ground, living in a smaller place. Financial and mental freedom increased proportionally.



Quit waiting for perfect conditions. To start the business. To have the conversation. To make the change. Conditions will never be perfect. There's always a reason to wait. The Courage to Be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi breaks down Adlerian psychology and how we use ""reasons"" as excuses to avoid change. It's uncomfortable but freeing. Life got simpler when I stopped waiting for permission or perfect timing and just started.



The common thread in all of this is that simplification isn't about having less stuff, though that helps. It's about having less mental clutter. Less decisions. Less obligations. Less guilt. Your brain has limited processing power. Spend it on things that actually matter.",2,1769479782.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

I’m a Spanish software engineer & senior architect, currently working at a Big Four, with 4 years of experience.
I can work fully remotely (I already have, including from abroad).

Honestly, conditions in Spain are pretty bad right now — both in corporate jobs and especially as a freelancer (taxes, pay, bureaucracy, etc.).

I’ve just been granted a Work and Holiday visa for Australia, and I’m seriously considering quitting my job and moving there.
My goal would be:

	1.	Enter Australia on WHV
	2.	Get a software engineering role locally (I don’t mind I have to work on coffees/hospitality etc meanwhile looking for an engineering job. I feel tired aswell of my work)
	3.	Get sponsored and stay long-term

I’m not asking if it’s “worth it” emotionally — but financially and professionally:
	•	Do software engineers actually get paid well in Australia?
	•	Is there real demand for engineers?
	•	How realistic is getting sponsored after starting on a WHV?

Any tips, cities to target, visa strategies, recruiters, or things to avoid would be hugely appreciated.

Thanks in advance 🙏",2,1769479696.0,expats,3,1.0,False

During his IEP the discussion of dietary needs came up and how we are watching what he’s consuming due to his unhealthy intake of carbs, sugars, and not eating enough protein. We have majority and work really hard to make SS who is 6 to eat different foods so he’s getting his nutrients, but every time we go to pickup SS has a happy meal, surgery treat, or ice cream. He’s even the kid known to steal his teachers Starbucks in class. (I don’t drink coffee and his dad doesn’t get them either, BM is addicted to Starbucks). Now I’m aware we can’t control what happens over there, I’m well aware of that but now SS is steaming with words like “Donald’s” or “ice cream” nearly everyday here. We don’t give him those things everyday, it’s a once in a while occurrence, so for him to have a full blown meltdown because he’s not getting these things is concerning. At one point I was at the store with him, and he started shouting for the soda as we walked by the soda isle. He’s six, we haven’t given him soda at all. Now that it’s causing distress in our home and he’s been having full meltdowns because of this, what would be some advice you could give me? This is also happening with screen time, certain kids shows he shouldn’t be watching, and his constant wanting of an IPad. ",0,1769479649.0,Stepmom,1,0.33,False

• Cards being considered: Fidelity 2% cash back, Venture X, Capitol One Savor. I don't want more than 2 extra credit cards for simplicity's sake. 

ADDITIONAL INFO

I'm a 28F working professional. I don't spend much besides food and travel. I do spend a lot of money on donating to various nonprofits, especially local nonprofits, and those do go on my credit card ($300/month).

I value simplicity in my life. I don't want to deal with credit cards that are always changing major benefits and would like a steady, established credit card so I don't have to constantly reoptimize my points. 

• I pay my rent through Zelle - I am wary of Bilt and would want it to be more established before committing to it. 

•I would be interested in ""ethical"" credit cards associated with credit unions or some sort of financial mechanism that invests money back into local communities, green initiatives that are NOT just marketing/greenwashing etc. If those are legit, I would prefer them to Fidelity or Venture X. I also want to consider other options besides the ones I listed, to see if I'm missing anything. I would consider a good travel card along with that ""ethical"" credit card (knowing no card is perfect, but just aiming for harm reduction). 

\- On a side note, should I set up a small subscription on my Wells Fargo card to keep the account ""active?"" Does Wells Fargo ever close down an account without telling you if it's inactive?

LO is very hot and cold, texting daily for 5 months, LO then suggested coffee, after coffee, texting stopped, LO stopped texting back. Then went to an event with LO and had lunch after 4 months after coffee.

I Do multiple mental health events per year including conferences throughout the country.

Months later is when we got closer and got coffee, lunch etc. really confused.

At these conferences I feel unwanted and cry myself to sleep in the hotel room.

1qo0iiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qo0iiq/ping_ping_ping_ping_ping_ping/,Ping ping ping ping ping ping,"Saturday, 0900. Aino’s datapad erupted like an angry swarm of insects: ping ping ping ping ping.

He groaned into his pillow, burying his face deeper. “Leave me alone. I need sleep.”

Ping.

“I bet it’s Elizabeth or Rachel. You’d think as women they’d sleep in on a weekend.”

Ping ping ping.

He cracked one eye open. The screen glowed with notifications—dozens already. Message previews scrolled:

\#1: 🤣 Wake up, Johnny!

\#2: You’re late, Mindy!

\#3: Let’s go to the beach everyone!

\#4: Johnny, can you get beer 🍺 🤣

\#5: Mike, you want to go fishing?

\#6: Sally, you want to help?

\#7: Everyone go to the beach. Administrator Aino contact is on a sign.

Aino sat bolt upright. “WTF?”

He scrolled frantically. Every message ended with some variation of “Everyone send Aino a message at 0900 Saturday.” His contact info—personal datapad ID—had been plastered somewhere public. Hundreds of pings now, from everyone  he barely knew, all timestamped right on the hour.

He typed furiously to Elizabeth, Rachel, and Marcus:

Someone posted my contact on the beach. My pad’s exploding—over 40 messages already. Meet me at the beach.

Send.

Ping ping ping. More incoming.

“Arrrgh.” He slapped the notifications mute, swung his legs out of bed, and rubbed his face. Coffee. He needed coffee. No time to brew—he’d grab some on the way. Elizabeth always had the good stuff.

Pants, shirt, shoes. He glanced out the window: streets empty, sky clear, no storm brewing. “Darn kids playing games. This has prank written all over it.”

He stepped outside, the morning air crisp with salt and distant pine from the forest edge. New Town felt oddly quiet—no fabricator hums from the central yard, no kids chasing each other . Everyone inside? Or… gone?

He tapped on the stained-glass door of her office (which doubled as Elizabeth’s frequent coffee “ they have had tons of coffee sent after the news crew frost talked with Wyatt” stop for everyone ). Locked. Unusual.

Datapad out: Hey Marcus, you at the old house? Send.

Reply almost immediate: Sorry Aino, I’m out with the track crew today.

“Never mind. Thanks,” he muttered, typing back.

Rachel’s hab next. No answer at the door. But fresh flowers bloomed in pots on the bench—Anna’s touch. Purple starblooms, yellow sun trumpets. She always brought fresh ones for Elizabeth and Rachel. Aino’s own pots? Dead within days. He sighed. “Figures.”

He headed toward the beach, two streets away. Still no people. Odd. Another block, and there—30 meters ahead—a handmade sign staked in the middle of the empty road:

Everyone send Aino a message at 0900 Saturday

He stared. “You kidding me?”

Datapad scroll: hundreds of messages now. Jokes, well-wishes, memes, fishing invites, beer requests—all funneled through that one posted contact.

He kept walking, beach in sight. Waves lapped gently, sand pale and empty. No one. “What the—”

Footsteps behind him. He glanced over his shoulder.

There they were: Marcus, Rachel, Elizabeth, the Sergeant Major, and a growing crowd—hundreds of New Town colonists streaming up the path, laughing, holding signs.

He turned fully. More signs everywhere:

Happy Birthday Aino!

New Town’s Favorite Admin 

No Work Today—Beach Day Declared!

Rachel and Elizabeth reached him first. Rachel kissed his cheek; Elizabeth followed, pressing a steaming mug of coffee into his hands. Real beans, The scent hit him like a hug.

“Aino,” Elizabeth said, grinning wide, “this is a declared holiday for New Town. No reports, no requisitions, no pings. Just your day.”

Aino stood stunned, coffee warm against his palms. The crowd cheered softly—warm, not mocking. Marcus stepped forward, clapping a massive hand on his shoulder.

“Come on, boss,” Marcus said, steering him toward a cluster of beach chairs under a fabricated shade canopy. “What would you like to do on your birthday? This is your day.”

Aino blinked, looking around. Tables held platters—fresh fruit from the hydro-gardens, grilled skewers from the community smokers, cold drinks chilling in ice chests. Kids ran with kites; someone fired up a portable grill the smell of bacon . Music drifted from a speaker—old Terran blues  mixed with New principality blues . 

He took a sip of coffee. Perfect. “You… all of you… did this?”

Rachel laughed. “We planned it for weeks. The sign prank was Johnny’s idea—he said the best way to get you out of bed was chaos. Worked, didn’t it?”

Elizabeth nudged him. “You never take a day off. Never celebrate. So we made you.”

Marcus grinned. “And the messages? We told everyone to spam you at exactly 0900. Figured you’d think it was a prank gone wrong and come investigate. Administrator instincts.”

Aino shook his head, a reluctant smile breaking through. “You’re all insane. And… thank you.”

The Sergeant Major saluted casually. “Holiday approved by Wyatt  himself—Wyatt sent a message: ‘Give Aino the day. He’s earned it.’” He pointing at Rachel it’s her fault . 

Aino’s throat tightened. He looked at the crowd—people he’d helped settle disputes for, approved homes for, worried over supply lines with. Families waving, kids holding handmade cards.

He cleared his throat. “Alright. Since it’s my day… I want to swim. Haven’t done that in months. Then… food. Lots of food. And maybe some of that beer Johnny keeps asking about.”

Cheers erupted. Elizabeth tugged him toward the water. “Last one in buys the next round!”

Marcus laughed. “You’re on.”

Aino kicked off his shoes, rolled up his pants, and waded in. The water was cool, perfect. For the first time in forever, no datapad buzzed in his pocket. Just waves, laughter, friends.

He glanced back at the beach: signs flapping in the breeze, people setting up games, Anna arranging fresh flowers on tables. Rachel and Elizabeth waved from the shallows, already splashing each other.

Aino smiled—real, unguarded. “Best birthday ever.”

And for once, the administrator of New Town let himself relax. The barony could wait. Today, the beach belonged to him",4,1769479361.0,OpenHFY,0,0.84,False

I mostly use my MacBook to do work while traveling or when I want to work from a coffee shop while at home. I do light photoshop work (cropping, spot correction, and color edits mostly), light adobe premiere work (mostly cutting short videos and basic color correction), and some work on illustrator (making tech packs for t shirts, flat logo creation, nothing too heavy).

Beyond that, the MacBook is for browsing and watching shows/movies while I travel, and the main reason for wanting to switch is a lighter footprint while on the go. I have a desktop PC at home that I’ve built that can do the more intense photo/video stuff I would ever need.

I don’t play into it, but I always make sure to treat everyone politely, especially since a lot of the kids in my class seem to ignore him and he told me he’s struggling finding friends at some point. So whenever he strikes up any conversation I converse back in earnest. I’ve gone through phases a few years back where I was into some of the things he’s into now, so it’s not difficult to talk with him.

Thing is, though….i don’t want him as a friend, let alone a boyfriend. I’m getting to an age where I really am growing desperate for people I feel connection with, people who fulfill me. I want people who make me feel validated after hanging out, even if that might be in a bunch of different ways depending on the person. This guy in particular is a little immature, and I don’t feel excited or fulfilled socially when we talk—it always feels like I’m babysitting him.

All my life, because I’m a bit of a pushover, I’ve always gotten these types of people who latch onto me, and don’t understand politey ‘no’s’. I try to imagine myself in their place, and I think I’d literally hate it if someone was hanging out with me out of guilt.

I will never understand it cause I never did it myself. If anyone ever actively ignored my texts and calls long enough, I’d take that as a message to stop trying. Today he struck up conversation with me, a fucking year and a half of me never replying to his texts or calls, EVER, a YEAR AND A HALF OF SILENCE, and he was asking me why I haven’t replied, why I’m never down for coffee outside of class…

What the hell am I supposed to say? ‘We’re adults, figure it out?’ ‘I don’t like you?’ That doesn’t seem right. I keep politely declining, but the underlying message never gets across. These people don’t read between the lines, it frustrates me. How do I deal with this as an adult? He’s sensitive too, and already down on himself, I don’t know how to turn him down or if that’s even moral, or something. Dude just wants to hang.

1qo059f,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/1qo059f/first_ap/,First AP,"Long timer lurker, I apologize in advance for the long post. I (F) got emotionally involved with a married man (M). We live in different countries but share industry circles and mutual friends, so it’s not a clean “block and disappear” situation. I’m also in a committed relationship, which adds another layer to the guilt/confusion (it was also both our first times stepping into affair territory).

We were friendly acquaintances for years (cordial, occasional messages/collabs). After a coffee hangout last fall, something shifted hard for me — it felt like we were suddenly on the same wavelength, but we stayed in a “friends/collab” lane for months until I went back to his city and things escalated but we stopped short. It felt intensely intimate and weirdly safe in a way I’ve never felt before.

Then came two months of rumination (for both of us). We didn’t immediately jump into a “relationship,” but the emotional/physical tension stayed high. We were messaging, collaborating, and it felt like the connection was building toward something that was almost inevitable. It’s hard to explain, but it felt like we were both thinking about what happened and what it meant, even if we weren’t openly saying everything.

When I went back, he showed up like he was on a mission—kissed me right away, said it was all he could think about, and acted very sure in the moment. Early on he also reassured me a lot and tried to remove guilt from the equation (basically framing it like we could have intimacy in a bubble away from real-life problems). At that point, he didn’t present himself as conflicted—more like confident and decisive.

After that trip, the push–pull started. Once I left, his communication shifted into a pattern: not texting much, but checking in every few days—especially when I went quiet. He’d disappear, then reappear with a comment or check-in. It was enough to keep me hooked, but not consistent or secure.

Later, when the texting got more intense (it started to feel like a fake “relationship bubble”), he pulled back harder. When I went back a few months ago, things escalated once but it definitely felt that he was stressed out about the situation so I confronted him nicely about it. he had a “final” conversation saying he felt guilty and needed to do the right thing, how he’d always seen himself as the ‘good guy’ and basically he couldn’t handle going back home and looking his kids in the eye. He said he didn’t want to ruin the friendship  and assured that multiple times. But since that conversation, he has initiated basically zero and feels like a wall, but he still lurks around my social media, and has been responsive but doesn’t elaborate when i’ve initiated texts.

Personality/context: He’s always been more on the quiet/private side — not a big texter, not someone who shares what he’s thinking easily, and he tends to keep things contained. Even during our “friend/collab” phase, his communication style was often sparse and a bit detached. He’s literally told me he’s a private person and that most people don’t know what he’s thinking. What’s confusing is that in our last big conversation  (when he ended it), he did communicate and open up in a way he normally doesn’t — he said he’d “never opened up like this to anyone” before. But since that talk, he’s initiated basically nothing, which makes it feel like whiplash: capable of depth when confronted, then complete shutdown afterward.

I’m trying to detach: muted/archived the chat, turned off “last seen,” stopped initiating, and even hid my stories from him because seeing his name would spike my nervous system. Still, because we share an industry circle, reminders keep popping up, and I’m worried about seeing him again when I’m in town in next.

What I need advice on:

	•	How do I detach from someone who was intensely present in person but avoids consistency afterward?

	•	How do I handle shared circles without reopening the wound?

	•	If we cross paths, what boundaries actually work to avoid being pulled back into the same loop?

TL;DR: First physical moment created a strong bond, then 2 months of “inevitable” rumination, June trip was a big escalation where he was decisive and tried to remove guilt, and afterward it turned into push–pull and then silence/guilt shutdown. We share an industry community and I’m struggling to detach.",0,1769478423.0,adultery,3,0.5,False

We have a stash of marshmallows and chocolate we give out or I’ll get them an occasional donut when I go for coffee. So they get treats, just in moderation. 

When we go to family’s they’re constantly asking if kids can have \[insert literally any junk food item\] constantly. And we are usually always saying no thank you. Sometimes we say yes, depends. 

Every single time my kids go to a grandparents or somewhere without me, my 4 year old son will come back home and say “Hey mom, \*grammy let me have chocolate milk\*” in like this crappy, condescending tone. 

Another example was tonight at dinner. I’ve had to tell him over and over in his life that we don’t blow in people’s faces.

Cartagena (group – fun/social):

* Best areas to stay
* Food + nightlife (bars, lounges, dancing)
* Beach recommendations (relaxed vs lively)
* we’re for sure doing palenque history tour. 

Santa Marta (group – beach + nature):

* Best beaches
* Nature experiences (waterfalls, jungle, hikes)

1qo01xs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qo01xs/aitah_for_cutting_off_an_old_bossmentor_for/,AITAH for cutting off an old boss/mentor for making up nasty rumors?,"A few months ago I got a pretty prestigious job. I’ll keep all the identifiers about the job discrete for anonymity purposes.

It was a big deal for me and I had the intention of going 110% and making the most of it. I came to work on time and never left early, wore nice business casual clothes I bought specifically for this job, and tried to get along with my peers and coworkers. I realized that my assigned mentor was not following the rules for the program, which was pretty frustrating because I had brought up a 1:1 meeting to sort out details several times and they never followed through. 

In the meantime, I’m trying to make the most of the job by fully participating in the activities outside of the “office” placement within the company. 

I start getting the weird feeling that I’m being discussed by my colleagues. Rooms were silent when I walked it and I was mocked for bending down to get something from the break room fridge.

Based on this and the fact that my project was never taken seriously from the start, I started to spend less time inside the office and more time around the company campus.

Meanwhile, my program mentor also starts acting off. I got the feeling that he didn’t like me, but I decided to shrug it off and keep putting my best foot forward. A few weeks of this go by, and I started onboarding for my new position that started the same month the current one ended. I had asked for time off ahead and my mentor had given me permission to take “mental health days” if needed, so I thought I was fine to complete my onboarding instead of working some days. 

To be fair, this was definitely on me and I definitely should’ve been honest with the team about having overlap between roles. However, I didn’t feel comfortable sharing since I had been brushed off anytime I tried to share input.

I also want to include the fact that they had the impression that *I could be a psychopath or narcissist* because of the fact that I didn’t react when I was yelled at for making a mistake on an assignment I wasn’t given clear instructions on. They also thought that my focus on wearing nice clothes and makeup could be an indicator. Aside from this, they were taking private information about my upbringing (struggled in school due to ADHD, moved around due to instability) and claiming that I was either lying about it or my family was problematic in some way and it explained the moving and struggling. 

I received some advice from a peer to bring sweets or food to share whenever you want to do something nice. So, I decided I would bring some extra produce from my dad’s garden. I continued to bring snacks (sweet bread, extra tomatoes, thyme) and a few other things here and there. 

My mentor made some off hand joke about me having a crush on one of the other people in the lab (because we had a coffee chat and I mentioned learning one of the languages they speak) and it made me feel very odd, especially considering I was significantly younger than everyone working there. I just glared at them and continued my presentation. 

Some other things I should mention are that I talked about a traumatic experience from my childhood and laughed it off (which my therapist later told me is a normal reaction by traumatized people). 

I was getting feedback on an assignment that was past due (also my fault), when they asked me into their office and started clipping their nails. If you know anything about gay women, you’d know that having short nails is considered a subtle tell. So when she did that, I guess she was expecting me to feel comfortable enough to hit on her (?) I realized that the rumor of me having a crush on a coworker had gotten to her, and she was testing the theory. As I saw this, I asked if now was a good time and offered to return at a later time. They insisted that I could enter, so I got the feedback and left. The next day, I realized that I should probably start dressing down if people were truly suspicious that I had a crush on my coworker. I wore leggings and an oversized hoodie to work, since that was relatively common in this office anyway. My intention was to lay low and just not do anything to give into rumors. The reaction from them (the nail clipper) was truly insane. They saw me and exclaimed “you’re smart, (my name)” and immediately started gossiping about me to coworkers in a foreign language. 

I was beyond shocked and embarrassed. It was also my first time in an office job and I had no idea there were so many unspoken rules about interpersonal dynamics. 

It was one of the last days of the project and I had some health issues arise (insomnia, anxiety, headaches) so I started arriving later. I had barely any work to do after the last assignment was submitted. 

Some other details: I was recorded being very very rude to a peer on one occasion (absolutely my fault), I told them a lie about having a boyfriend (avoiding crush rumors and did not want to disclose sexuality), and I lied about my dad’s job. I was pretty grandiose about the boyfriend lie and, to be honest, it was pretty dumb to think that no one would notice because I was a pretty bad liar. I also snapped a few times with another coworker and had an attitude because I was miserable from not eating and sleeping. I had disordered eating habits and was doing OMAD and keto at the same time, basically eating less than 500 cals per day. 

Due to those things, they’ve come to the conclusion that I’m dark triad (psychopath, narcissist, machiavellian). Having a “mean streak”, being “attention seeking”, and many other claims by them. I’ve been messaged on email, text, and whatsapp by them basically “testing” me for the past several months after the job ended to see if I have HPD. They apparently developed a sub theory that I also have histrionic personality disorder and have been “testing” if I am gullible by sending phishing messages. They’ve also created dozens of social media accounts across multiple platforms to bait me into interacting with content that would basically “incriminate” me as being dark triad. I knew because they posted something about dark triad in a public forum that anyone can submit to and left a clue about it being submitted by them, plus they already suspected I had some sort of personality disorder so it wasn’t ridiculous to think that.

I was friends with all of them on a professional networking site, but, finally, after my former mentor was incessantly interacting with content suggesting that I had lied about having ADHD and several other things, I decided that I didn’t want to deal with it anymore and emailed them to hopefully get a chance to clear things up. I got no response. Instead, they posted something basically mocking me for getting emotional in a private conversation. It was about me crying about “breaking up with my boyfriend” that did not exist. I realize how this may sound, but they were real tears about having to lie to my family about my sexuality and cutting off a relationship with someone from my church that I wasn’t talking to because I realized I couldn’t fake being straight. 

Of course, it was too subtle for others to notice, and I looked crazy for un adding everyone over something that “wasn’t even about me.” I was just tired of the drama and ready to end the relationships because they weren’t giving me a chance to talk or clarify, as they already decided that I was a psychopath or something.

My program mentor posted something on the previously mentioned forum that clued me in to the fact that the office members were still discussing me and it was about being either dark triad or having HPD. 

Keep in mind I had already sent a private apology to my former mentor about the rudeness to them and everyone in the office. Person to person, I know the way I behaved was not normal. I was going through a lot in my personal life, didn’t know much about navigating the workplace professionally, and severely lacked judgement about lying. I genuinely felt like I went through some form of mania, and I immediately got back on my anti depressant medication and resumed therapy as soon as possible after realizing that I was going mad. 

However, I don’t think it warrants them harassing me months after the fact. From my perspective, it seems like their lives are too boring to mind their own business and they’re getting kicks out of supposed karmic retribution towards me since I’m sooo evil. I get that they’re frustrated and strongly suspect that I have a personality disorder, but I don’t have one and this is getting to be excessive. They already overstepped boundaries, but it’s getting to the level of harassment.

I can no longer ask them for a LOR for future positions and they’ve discussed this situation with people all over the company. What more do they want? I apologized to the peer I was very very rude to privately. I’m sorting through my personal issues to prevent myself from going mad again. I’m wondering if I did the right thing with cutting them off or if I should’ve just clarified everything. My therapist got more details about this and said that I can’t expect emotional maturity from people that were never mature to begin with, and even if I clarify those things (ADHD, why I lied, dads garden, etc) they would find something else. She also said that they have all the reason to suspect those things and were hurting me back for the issues I caused, which I accept. 

If they continue the texts/emails, I will absolutely take this to law enforcement as it is considered harassment. They also used fake profiles to match with me on hinge and get information. I had a feeling that it could’ve been them, but I didn’t want to be too paranoid. They tricked me into thinking I was talking to someone that I wasn’t, which is a love scam and definitely can be reported as a cyber crime. I later realized they were regurgitating info I had shared with a peer about this “boyfriend” (more like situationship) to make it seem like the “perfect match” and that’s when I realized it was them.

Sorry this is so long, but this situation warrants details and I’m seriously at my wits end. I realize that I am to blame for many of these accusations, but they’re not true and I just want them to know that I never intended harm and I am not the dangerous person they’re making me out to be. I want them to stop but at this point they’re absolutely convinced and it’s affecting not just my mental health due to the constant reminders, but my work reputation and access to future opportunities.
