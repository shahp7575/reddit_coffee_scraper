I hope you're doing well, sipping coffee or tea (or maybe something fancier that you've developed a taste for). Right now, I'm sitting here, thinking about all the growth I've been through, and how much there still is aead. Rememebr the tiems when things felt overwhelming? Yeah, I'm still dealing with that... but I'm knda hopeful it won't last forever. 

My biggest hope is that you're becoming the wise, amazing person I dream of being, filled with knowledge and experiences that enrich your life and the lives of those around you. Keep pushing yourself... always aim to be better, but be kind to yourself, too. Self-improvement is a journey, not a race. 

And tbh, if you're currently stresesd out about a little project or relationship wobble, just pause and breathe... You'll get through it, like you have beofre. 🌱 Annyway, I just wanted to remind you to stay true to yourself, find joy in the little things, and keep dreaming big. 

Here's to the beauutiful journey ahead. Love you loads. ❤️",1,1754986099.0,MyDearFutureMe,0,1.0,False

I’ve always been into frothy instant coffee or South Indian filter coffee, so this is my first time with drip-style brewing.

Here’s what happened:

I accidentally ordered coarse ground coffee (Sleepy Owl Dark Roast) instead of medium.

Brewed my first pot today black, it was actually nice! Smooth, light, and clean-tasting.

But when I added milk (like I usually do), it turned bland I think I either used too much milk or the coffee wasn’t strong enough
I get that drip coffee is different from espresso or filter coffee (less froth, lighter body), so I’m not disappointed, but I’m still figuring out what my “type” is with this machine.

So… what are your favorite things to make with drip coffee?

I like Vietnamese coffee, iced coffee, and fun coffee drinks (even Coke coffee sounds cool).

Just looking for ways to make drip coffee exciting and flavorful.

Any brewing tips, ratios, or recipe ideas would be amazing

I have a bag packed in July. The key for me has been to aim for a 3-4 minute extraction at a 1:6 ratio with a 1:2 bloom for a minute at a lower temperature and the rest of the brew at water just off boil. The grind size adjusts accordingly. Dilute with water afterwards to like a 1:15 or so. Lots of citrus flavour and really nice, satisfying mouth feel with a chocolaty finish. The coarse ground size also means very low sediment too which is great. I have not tried it with milk, so YMMV there. Of course, it is not the most interesting or the best cup, but if you are struggling to get through a bag of it, this might work and actually be quite pleasant.",2,1754985601.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

By the 7th **year** with Gavin Foster, Cecilia Jordan was ready to walk down the aisle. She had prepared her wedding dress\*\*,\*\* just waiting for him to pop the question. 

They had shared every first, first crush, first kiss, first heartbreak, from college classrooms to office meetings. Somewhere along the way\*\*,\*\* Cecilia had disappeared into just being Gavin’s girl. 

# Read Link Full Story: [https://writers.sugarspicecorner.com/better-1/](https://writers.sugarspicecorner.com/better-1/)

Word had been going around about Gavin and that college girl he was helping out. Cecilia’s friends warned her, but she ignored it, until her pre–marriage health checkup. 

There **was** Gavin, who had said he was in meetings, holding some girl’s hand during her blood draw. He fussed over that girl like she was made of glass, his face all soft with concern. Cecilia’s fingers trembled as she crumpled the lab slip and dropped it in the trash. 

\*\*\*\*\* 

“Cecilia, Mr. Quinn’s nephew is back from overseas. He’s hoping to set up a meeting for you two.” On the phone, Cecilia’s mother Lily Terry carefully brought up the subject. When Cecilia stayed silent, Lily quickly added, “Unless you’re not interested. I can always say no.” 

“Mom, tell Mr. Quinn I’ll meet his nephew,” Cecilia said calmly. Lily paused in surprise. Last time, Cecilia had firmly refused it. “I’ve switched divisions at work,” Cecilia continued, “so I’m not stuck at work late anymore. Just let me know the details when they’re set.” 

Hanging up the phone, Cecilia got out of the car with a designer shopping bag in hand. She had just picked up the gift from a high–end boutique downtown. Taking a deep breath, she straightened her dress and walked toward the hotel entrance. 

The hotel’s fifth–floor ballroom glittered with decorations. A lavish spread covered the buffet tables in honor of Stella Yates joining Foster Group. Dressed in white Dior with a sparkling tiara, Stella stood surrounded by admirers, just like a pampered princess. 

The crowd started chanting “**Kiss**! Kiss!**”** as they nudged Stella toward Gavin. With a giggle, Stella linked her arms with Gavin for the champagne toast. But with two sips in, she was already swaying, tumbling right into Gavin’s waiting arms. 

Then someone spotted Cecilia entering and gasped her name, their face going rigid. The party noise died instantly. Flushed, Stella tried to wiggle free from Gavin’s grip, but he pulled her closer instead, completely unbothered by Cecilia’s arrival. “You’re **late**,” was all he said about missing their appointment. 

**Cecilia** offered **a composed** smile\*\*,\*\* blaming the heavy rain and bad traffic for her late arrival. Gavin barely glanced at her **as** he took the gift bag. Turning to Stella, his voice warmed, “Remember my promise? A welcome gift for joining Foster Group.” With theatrical **flair, he presented** the velvet box\*\*.\*\* 

Stella’s **eyes** widened in shock, then immediately sparkled with delight. “**It’s** perfect. My absolute favorite!” she said, her **voice** trembling with emotion. “Thank you\*\*,\*\* Gavin,” **she** added, her gaze shining with adoration. 

**“Here**, let me\*\*,”\*\* Gavin murmured, taking **her** hand with **unexpected** tenderness. His **face** was strangely serious **as** he slid the ring onto **her** finger\*\*,\*\* the moment **so** intimate it could’ve **passed** for a marriage proposal. 

Phones **lit up across the** room **as the crowd eagerly snapped photos**. “That ring says it all,” a **voice** called out. **Others** chimed in, **“Stella’s clearly under** Mr. **Foster’s** protection now.” The crowd burst into **cheers**. 

Gavin pulled Stella close, whispering in her ear, “How should you thank me\*\*?”\*\* Stella stood on tiptoe and kissed his cheek. With a doting smile, **Gavin** announced to everyone, “Starting today, Stella will be my personal assistant\*\*.\*\*” Cecilia’s breath hitched. Memories came rushing back. 

\*\*\*\*\*

**Cecilia** was seven when Gavin moved in next door. The first time they met, he told her she was pretty and started coming over every day. He always held her hand and said, “Cecilia, I’ll protect you.” And he did. He never let anyone bully **her**, kept other **boys away**, and made sure she didn’t date anyone. 

On the night of her 18th birthday, after a **glass** of wine, Cecilia finally asked what she had always wondered. “Why won’t you let me date anyone?” she demanded, cheeks flushed. “I’m not a kid anymore, Gavin. I want to be with someone, like a normal girl.” 

Gavin, deadly serious, cornered her in a secluded spot and declared, “If you want to be with someone, it has to be me. I’ve waited eleven years for you. I won’t let you be with anyone else, because I like you.” Their first kiss was awkward, all missed angles and nervous laughter, but it made her heart race anyway. 

During college, she and Gavin were always together. When people made fun of him for being born out of wedlock, she stood up for him without hesitation. She even gave him a precious jade carving, helping him win some respect from the Foster family. 

Later, her family lost everything. After her father died, her mother had to move her younger brother and her from their big house to a small, run–down home in the countryside. That same year, Gavin’s real father finally claimed him, bringing him into the wealthy Foster family. 

Everyone thought he would leave her. But when he won the university marathon, sweaty and breathless, he pulled her close and announced to the crowd, “Cecilia’s my girl. We’re staying together until we’re old and gray.” That was her happiest 

moment. 

After graduation, she gave up the chance to study abroad and chose to work as Gavin’s secretary at Foster Group. Day and night, she stayed by his side, supporting him as he secured his position as the heir. She looked forward to a future where they would marry, have children, and grow old together. 

Then Stella appeared. That was when Cecilia realized the boy who had promised to marry her had never actually meant those words. Somehow, between then and now, his heart had strayed. 

\*\*\*\*\* 

“Cecilia, come help me cut the cake.” Stella called out with a bright voice as she hurried across the room. She held out a hand, her smile warm and inviting. 

Cecilia stepped back, letting Stella’s hand hang in the air. Her eyes turned frosty as she replied in a tone like chilled steel, “No **need**. I want no **part** in your **celebrations**.” 

**Stella** lowered **her head**, her eyes reddening. Gavin **stepped** forward immediately, his voice tight with irritation. **“Why take it out on Stella? It’s her first day. Was getting her the gift she wanted so wrong?** You’re transferring out the moment she joins. **Since when are you** this **petty**?” 

**Before Cecilia could speak**, **Gavin** took a **black** card from his wallet and shoved it at her. “Enough drama,**” he** snapped. “Go **get that** Chanel **bag you’ve** wanted for a long time.” 

**A** bitter **laugh escaped Cecilia’s lips**. He had always known **what she** wanted\*\*, yet\*\* never cared enough to give it. Their 

childhood love **had** curdled into something sour. Seven years without a ring said everything. “Let’s end this,” she **whispered**, **voice** cracking\*\*, eyes\*\* glistening with unshed tears. 

Gavin’s **expression** darkened, his **voice** sharp with irritation. “You begged for marriage, now you’re ending it? Throwing **a fit** over nothing? I won’t baby you anymore. You chose this. Don’t come crying later.” 

“Fine.” Cecilia drew a shaky breath, steadying herself. Behind them, Stella’s cheerful call for a group photo hung in the air, but Gavin didn’t even glance back as he strode off. 

**As** Cecilia left the hotel, her phone buzzed with a WhatsApp notification. There was Stella’s post in the company group, \[**Best** day ever. Found my person.\], and a photo showing her surrounded by gifts with Gavin’s ring front and center. 

Beneath the photo, Stella had deliberately tagged Cecilia with \[Thanks u/Cecilia\]. A hollow laugh escaped Cecilia’s lips. The old sting was gone. She tapped the thumbs–up icon, exhaled, and closed the app without looking back. 

\*\*\*\*\* 

At around 3 am, Gavin staggered through the door, reeking of alcohol. The lights were still on–clearly, Cecilia had returned and was waiting for him. “Cecilia, I drank too much. My head hurts. Give me a massage.” He collapsed onto the living room sofa and fell asleep instantly. 

\*\*\*\*\* 

The next morning, Gavin’s assistant called, jerking him awake. “Mr. Foster, it’s 8:30. You missed the morning meeting.” Gavin squinted at the clock, rubbing his pounding head, ‘Where’s Cecilia? She never forgets my schedule. 

“Cecilia?” He searched through every room, but found them all empty. For a brief moment, he stood stunned, but then let out a dismissive scoff. “I’ve been too soft on her,” he muttered. “Let her stew for a few days. She’ll come begging soon enough.” 

**Chapter 2** 

The bathroom was quiet except for the dripping faucet. Gavin toweled off and automatically reached for his clothes, but found nothing on the hook. For years, Cecilia had always hung his clothes there, neatly prepared. Now the bare hook just reminded him she was gone. 

He hesitated just a moment before heading to the closet. Putting on his suit, he tried two different ties, but neither looked right. Annoyed, he ripped them off and left his collar hanging open. 

Then he went downstairs, only to find the kitchen cold and empty, with no steaming coffee or plates set out. Lips pressed tight, he left for work without eating. 

X 

In the CEO’s office, Frank Murphy did a double–take. He never saw his boss eating at his desk before. Leaning in, he said. “Mr. Foster, the morning meeting has been canceled as instructed. Ms. Yates is starting today. I’ve got her set up by your office. She’ll be handling your schedule from now on.” 

Gavin looked up, his gaze catching on Stella in her navy suit. His hand stopped in the air. For a second, he could almost see Cecilia sitting in her usual spot by the window. 

Shaking off his thoughts, Gavin cleared his throat and gave Frank a half–hearted nod. “Right.” The word came out flat as his eyes drifted back to his own desk. 

Frank passed Gavin the project team list for the upcoming exhibition. As Gavin scanned the document, Cecilia’s name jumped out at him from the planners‘ section. 

He frowned at the paper. “The Jewelry Exhibition is one of our toughest projects this year.” Tapping the file with his pen, he added, “Since when does Cecilia handle event planning? She’s pushing herself too hard just to prove something.” 

Gavin seemed to have forgotten that he and Cecilia both graduated from Aletheia University. “Well, when she can’t handle it, she’ll realize the secretary team is where she fits best.” He tossed the file aside. “Keep her old desk available, Frank.” 

Cecilia silenced her sixth alarm and finally woke at 10 am, every muscle protesting last night’s moving chaos. She had worked until dawn, calling in her best friend for emergency help, scrambling to hire last–minute cleaners, hauling boxes until midnight, before finally collapsing in her new villa. 

Years back, Cecilia had hoped to reclaim her family’s foreclosed villa, but Gavin’s last–minute schedule change made her miss the auction. 

As an apology, he bought her this quiet villa instead. She furnished every inch of the place, though she never actually stayed there. Just having her name on the deed gave her a security nothing else could. 

She had more than just the villa. There was also a downtown apartment and a BMW coupe. When the relationship ended, she took everything that belonged to her, no apologies, no explanations. 

She wasn’t about to play the self–sacrificing fool just to make some grand gesture. What was hers stayed hers, simple as that. 

In the kitchen, Cecilia cooked breakfast with her phone on speaker. “Hello, I’d like to cancel the wedding dress I previously ordered. There’s no need to deliver it. Please dispose of it for me. Thank you.” 

Her best friend, Chloe Norris\*\*,\*\* walked in yawning, her throat parched. Cecilia pushed a warm mug toward her with an understanding look. “Morning. Made you some honey water.” Chloe cradled the mug in both hands, smiling her thanks. 

After listening to Cecilia’s sudden breakup story the night before, Chloe had ranted about that jerk for hours until her voice went hoarse. She checked the clock and rasped, “Shouldn’t you be at work? Did Foster Group go under or what?” 

“I’m with Project Division now, finally getting proper weekends off. And I think I’m going to quit.” Cecilia set down plates with sandwiches, flashing a tired but genuine smile. “Fridge is bare, but this’ll do for now.” 

Chloe took an eager bite, her eyes lighting up with surprise. “Even your sandwich tastes amazing,” she mumbled through a full mouth, crumbs tumbling onto her lap. She quickly brushed them away before leaning in curiously. “So what’s the plan after quitting?” 

Cecilia’s fingers trembled slightly as she traced the edges of the faded family photo. Taking a shaky breath, she whispered, “I haven’t designed a single piece since Dad died.” A determined glint flashed in her eyes as she straightened her shoulders. “But maybe now it’s the time to try again?” 

Chloe’s eyes lit up as she seized Cecilia’s hands, her grip warm and insistent. “Of course,” she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with excitement. “The Jordan family used to be the top jewelry name in Kingsford. Your hands were made for designing, not cooking for some man.” 

Chloe’s excitement was infectious. Cecilia felt it too, her eyes lighting up with new possibilities. “What if we opened our own studio?” she ventured, then bit her lip. “I would need a partner, though my savings won’t quite cover everything yet.” 

“Took you long enough to ask,” Chloe chuckled, her eyes dancing. “After my divorce, I took half that bastard’s fortune. The interest alone keeps me comfortable. I believe in your talent. I’ll handle the startup money. Let’s go big or go home.” 

Chloe immediately picked up her phone to order champagne and flowers. The celebratory pop of the cork signaled their new beginning. 

Still in their pajamas, they clinked glasses with exaggerated formality, pretending to toast their future fortunes. Then they collapsed into laughter and a tight embrace. 

On Monday, Cecilia caught bits of restroom gossips before the meeting. Two colleagues were whispering that her transfer to Project Division looked like a demotion, especially since Gavin had brought in some bright young girl as his new secretary. 

Cecilia shoved the stall door open with a loud bang. The two gossiping women at the sinks froze, one with lipstick smeared across her teeth, the other clutching a half–applied mascara wand in stunned silence. 

Meeting their startled reflections in the mirror, Cecilia simply walked past without a word. There was no point arguing with office gossips. They would only twist your words anyway. 

\*\* 

Cecilia’s exhibition plan showed real thought and attention to detail, surprising Project Manager David Zachary, who had assumed she was just another pretty face. 

When she handed in her resignation, David frowned. “Quitting so soon after transferring? At least think it over.” 

“Just personal reasons,” Cecilia said with a quiet smile. “But don’t worry, I’ll see the exhibition through to the end.” 

She had set a 30–day reminder on her phone. This final month would be her professional swan song, a chance to leave on her own terms with every project completed properly.

At the dinner party, Gavin stumbled out drunk, cigarette dangling from his lips as he dialed. When his Maybach arrived, only assistant Frank stepped out. One friend, Charles Lewis, asked in confusion. “Where’s Cecilia? She always picks you up.” 

“Ms. Jordan isn’t Mr. Foster’s secretary anymore,” Frank explained. Every head turned toward Gavin, clearly wondering if something had gone wrong between him and Cecilia. 

They all knew Gavin and Cecilia had been planning their wedding just weeks earlier. This sudden split didn’t make any 

sense. 

Gavin’s expression soured as the alcohol’s warmth drained from his face. “She overreacted to some stupid misunderstanding,” he muttered, grinding his cigarette into the pavement. “**If** she wants to break up, fine. But I’m not begging her to come back.” 

Charles shook his head in disbelief. “You two grew up together. You can’t throw that away over some petty argument.” Pulling out his phone, he added, “Let me talk to Cecilia, I’ll smooth things over.” 

He put the call on speaker before saying, “Cecilia, Gavin had drunk too much. Can you come pick him up? I’ll text you the location.” 

The line went silent for a few seconds before Cecilia’s voice came through, steady and final, “Not my responsibility anymore. Get someone else to babysit him.” The abrupt click of the call ending left the group stunned. 

Gavin’s lips curled in amusement. “Don’t you see?” he said, eyes glinting with smug satisfaction. “This breakup is just her way of forcing me to chase her. Now you called her. She would take it as surrender. Your ‘help‘ is only making her dig in harder.” 

Xavier Tate, always trying to keep the peace, ventured carefully, “But what if she’s serious this time? She only got jealous because she still cares\*\*.”\*\* 

Gavin brushed off the concern with a dismissive hand, absolutely certain Cecilia would come begging. The other guys all nodded in agreement, laughing at the ridiculous idea that Cecilia would ever actually leave Gavin for good. 

Cecilia’s phone buzzed with an incoming text. It was a message from her mother, \[Cecilia, your date is tomorrow at 7pm, Peninsula Café. Are you free?\]

Like, real-world money, not Monopoly cash (although, who wouldn’t want to be rich in board games? 😂). 

But seriously, isn’t it crazy how some days the ONLY thing anyone seems to talk about is that magical question: “HOW do I actually earn money?” I mean, everywhere you look, someone is hyped about side gigs, passive income, or that overnight-success-vibe.

But do you ever just stop and wonder... what does it even mean to really “earn” money? Is it TONS of hours grinding at something you only half-like, or can you turn your eureka moments into stacks of cash? 

- Why is it that some people seem to just “get it” when it comes to making money, while the rest of us are left scratching our heads?
- IS IT these secret hacks that influencers always promise but somehow never quite share, or is it genuinely all about luck and timing?
- Or, wild thought–maybe it’s about finding that thing you naturally obsess over (coffee? Coding? DOUGHNUTS?!) and seeing where it leads.

The thing is, every time I scroll through https://goodnovel.org/ I run into SO many stories where people just find themselves in this whirlwind of opportunities and suddenly—boom—they’re making money. Like, did these characters get a guidebook the rest of us missed, or…? 😅

I know interviews and webinars wax poetic about “hustle culture,” but I swear, sometimes all the advice clashes like loud house music with a slow jazz night. Do you go all-in pursuing the mystical *passion*? Or keep stacking that reliable paycheck until something magical pops?

Let’s break down what it REALLY feels like:

- Frustration when you put in the work and see, um, basically nothing.
- An explosion of joy when your project—or even your meme—finally goes viral.
- Complete confusion as you click through https://goodnovel.org/ and start to wonder, “Was there a secret plot twist about money making I missed in chapter ten?”

You know that feeling when everyone shouts, “Just start!” and you think, “Okay, with WHAT?” Maybe it’s waking up early to side-hustle before your actual job, or maybe it’s staring at your phone hoping for divine Venmo intervention. No shame. Been there, done that, got the overdraft fee 🙃.

At the core, does anyone else feel like winning at earning money owes just as much to confidence and timing as to skills or even persistence? Not everyone gets to write out the best rags-to-riches storyline or discover a golden ticket behind their account. But maybe, just maybe, it’s all about rewriting your daily script…like how you get hooked on chapters at https://goodnovel.org/ and one day, you realize YOU could be the protagonist, carving out a plot twist no one saw coming.

What have you tried? Did it work out, or did you end up in a comedic fail montage? What *ACTUALLY* helped you?

Lay it on me—let’s get honest, hype eachother, and laugh at the quest to earn those precious coins. Because honestly, WHO HAS THE COVER PAGE TO THE REAL “How to Get Money and Survive Your 20s (or 30s… or, um, 40s?)” Guide?

I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I hope someone here can relate to my dilemma.

I’m a third-year law student, and I live alone. Over time, I’ve noticed that I’ve become lazy when it comes to taking care of myself. Since I only have myself to think about, I often skip things like cooking or cleaning. I’d rather drink coffee and keep reading for school, or order food online instead of going to the market. It feels like there's no real reason to make an effort outside of academics.

But lately, I’ve been thinking — maybe having a dog would help change that. I grew up in the province with several big dogs, and I was the one who took care of them. I know it’s a big responsibility, but that’s actually what I’m looking for. I feel like if I had a dog with me here, I’d be more motivated to take care of my space, cook meals, and stay active. It would give me a reason to be more present and balanced in my daily life. Baka taking care of another living being would also remind me to take better care of myself.

Feeling ko wala akong disiplina, nahirapan ako magkaroon ng balance life tho kahit aware naman ako na ganyan talaga cons ng law school. That’s why I can’t help but admire those who manage to balance everything so well. I wish I could do the same! 🥹

If I do decide to go through with this, I’m planning to get a Shih Tzu since it’s a small breed and can move around freely without bothering my neighbors.  Makakaabala ba or matutulungan ako?

Pretty happy with it so far - the decaffeinated pods are definitely better than what I remember back in the day with the OL, and it's great to mix it up with different size coffees for different times of day. The caffeinated stuff definitely tastes way better in general than the decaf, but the decaf is drinkable for the most part. 

I do still enjoy having a caffeinated coffee 4-5 times a week and have particularly enjoyed the Double Espresso Chiaro and the Bianco Doppio in particular 🤌

Any other decaf drinkers out there with ideas on how to get the best taste out of a Vertuo?

The pains were debilitating; no painkillers would touch them, only lying on my left side would help. All other endo symptoms (horrible period cramps, ovulation pains, etc etc) were also present.

## Key Features Analysis

The best tic tac toe boards offer a blend of durability, aesthetic appeal, and functional design to enhance the playing experience.

A top-tier tic tac toe board should be constructed from high-quality materials that can withstand regular use.

Alternatively, some boards are made from durable acrylic or metal to provide a more modern appearance. High-grade plastics can also be used effectively, provided thay are designed to last and retain their appearance over time.

**Aesthetic Design**

The visual appeal of a tic tac toe board is just as important as its functionality. A well-designed board can serve as a decorative piece when not in use.

Some boards even incorporate artistic elements, such as intricate borders or custom-designed playing pieces, to elevate their aesthetic value.

**Portability and Size**

Depending on your intended use, portability may be a crucial factor. Smaller, travel-sized boards are ideal for on-the-go entertainment, while larger boards offer a more substantial playing experience for home use. Pay attention to the overall dimensions and weight of the board. Some portable boards come with integrated storage for the game pieces, ensuring that everything stays together when traveling. The size should strike a balance between convenience and agreeable gameplay.

**Game piece Design**

The design of the tic tac toe pieces is another important aspect to consider. Customary X and O pieces can be made from a variety of materials, including wood, metal, or plastic. Some boards feature more creative game pieces, such as gemstones, miniature figurines, or custom-designed shapes. The pieces should be easy to grip and manipulate, and they should complement the overall aesthetic of the board. The storage for the pieces is also notable.

# Alien-Nation Book Two, Chapter One: Welcome Home

*****

* *We gave peace a chance. It didn’t work.*

\-Mann Co.

Jacqueline.

There she stood, a sick smile twisted on her features as she tucked a blonde strand behind her ear to rest on her black leather jacket’s collar. She leaned forward onto the ball of her front foot. Her bright green eyes were familiar in color, though narrowed in a huntress's gaze, slender frame bending like a coiled spring, poised to charge me right down to the landing.

“Hey little bro,” she growled, hand already curling into a fist.

It didn’t take but a second for her to look at the way I was dressed and all the other ways I’d changed, and make the decision to wade in anyway. She crossed the distance in a half-second, all spring-heel motion.

I’d made decisions that could doom or save the course of humanity, so how was I now frozen to the spot? All I’d need to do was to take the half-step distance I’d need to force her to kill her momentum, and then…

I was staring down someone who had pummelled me senseless how many times? Unthinkable. It felt impossible. I just knew that I had to.

By the time I let loose with a halfhearted swing as she stepped into my reach, I still expected her to slow down, only for her to not hesitate in the slightest and crash right through my halfhearted warding punch. We came together into a tangle of limbs down the few stairs onto the top landing. She emerged on top and shoved my head into the wall, grasping for my face with long nails threatening to rake and rend flesh in long crimson lines if she found purchase.

It all felt wrong. I’d gotten so much stronger, hadn’t I? Gone through so much. And for what? Here we were, again?

The injustice of it all burned, and lit that fire to do something about it.

I was strong now, wasn’t I?

Strong enough to do *this, maybe.*

As her hands searched to find a sensitive like an eye to claw out, I pushed up with my hands. To both our surprise, I actually managed to get to my hands and knees with her still clinging on to me. She was banking that her added weight would be too much.

It wasn’t.

First I was on one foot, then both, and finally standing as she realized too late what was happening. She frantically tried to pitch the two of us over again, ignorant or uncaring that this time the two of us might go down a whole flight of steps.

It didn’t seem to matter to her as long as she took me with her.

My stance was steady, and I took hold of her by the neck and pushed back, killing her momentum, and then attacked.

With one hand I slammed her into the wall hard enough to dent into the hard old plaster.

She let out a surprised cough and spasmed from the impact, before jerking right back to life, as full of fury as ever.

Eyes just like mine stared up wide as I held her by the throat, right past the hands now desperate to ward me off.

Puberty and training had worked together to grant me the kind of strength I finally needed to strike back at my tormentor.

With a heave, I had her up and off the ground, at arm’s length as she scrabbled for my face with nails like talons, face twisted in anger, lips thinned by her vicious snarl.

One rough shake side to side, then another to test whether I had control, and then I pushed her up the stairs, back toward our parents. I slammed her against the wall again for good measure, before throwing my sister to the ground.

This was turning into a rout as one-sided as any Saint Michael’s scuffle.

Before she could stand I bellowed a challenge. Years of pent up rage and anger shook the sturdy old stone house to its foundations.

A less motivated foe might have frozen in shock or terror, but not Jacqueline. She just sent out a kick at my ankle- one hard enough to cause my foot to skid across the persian carpet.

I wonder now what might have happened if it had toppled me, if my foot had been more surely planted, or on a less slippery surface.

As it was, instead I stomped forward on my good foot, and she finally scrabbled back as some sort of survival instinct finally took root and she realized just how badly she had miscalculated.

I wouldn’t let her go. I’d given her the warning. Now she had to pay.

I caught her lagging foot as she tried to crawl away, and pulled before she could gather them both under her to stand. I dodged the reflexive kick from her other foot, pulled her toward me, stood over her, and came down with a closed fist, knuckles impacting hard enough that the back of her head bounced off the colorful hallway carpet and stunned her.

The longer this went, the more my bloodlust rose until I knew if this went on longer, I’d probably kill her.

“Are we done yet?” I shouted, giving us an exit ramp before this turned into a runaway disaster.

*Please,* I thought to myself. *Please let it stop here.*

Jacqueline stayed tense and looked up to our parents, neither of whom had moved an inch since it’d started- in fact, both of them looked her in the eyes like a Roman Emperor might’ve been able to grant some last bit of mercy.

Neither of them snapped at me to back off, or stop.

The choice was mine, in other words. I wasn’t sure what I’d done to earn this kind of leeway. Greater time and separation would eventually lend me some sense of the oddity of all this, but for now all I could wonder how to use it. Was this where Jacqueline had stood, for however many years? How could I use my victory?

I could chase it to the utmost, bellow: ‘*vae victis*,’ but what would that gain me? What would it cost? She was my blood sibling. I wouldn’t get another. The point had been made, surely, that she knew not to cross me or else.

I let go of her lapel and stood up tall, hands relaxing as I stared down my nose at her. I didn’t have to kill my sister.

I didn’t have to help her up, either.

“Welcome home.”
  
*****

Dinner was early, sped along by the extra set of hands prepping. Father, bound by his habits, had seasoned himself with a glass or two in the process, and for the first time in over a year we sat as a family of four. 

Jacqueline wouldn’t stop staring between Mom and Dad, and then glaring at me from across the family dinner table as everyone exchanged bland niceties. Had the dynamic been like this before she’d left and I’d forgotten? Or had I simply been blissfully unaware?

She’d avoided me since our earlier scuffle, and for my part, the only thing I could think to do was refuse to let her bother me. That worked, until she moved to pick up and fling the glass salt shaker right at my head. I ducked- and nothing. No painful impact, or thick ornate glass thudding against the plaster wall behind me, just a snort from her end of the table as she set it down, a sprinkle of the white stuff on the table.

A test. One I’d apparently failed going by the smug look on her face.

Now I had to just hope that she was satisfied here.

Even if I decided to challenge her, showing my hand was probably not the best idea. If she was completely committed to violence as her means, then by beating her down, at most, I’d just convince her to try an alternate method. I’d have to start fearing poison, attacks while I slept, or her wrecking my belongings.

Worst of all, she might go digging for dirt, something to damn me in the eyes of our parents, or the aliens. After all, Elias Sampson had been playing along as the cooperative little boy, excited to share videos to his isolated girlfriend. If I took her precious spot as ‘top dog’ or whatever she was angling for and she sought payback, then it made sense that’s where she’d start.

My standing here did not matter to me in the slightest.

So if I didn’t challenge her, would she take the feigned obedience as a victory and let sleeping dogs lie?

When I met her eyes she flipped me off.

*No chance.*

Home wasn’t safe anymore, that was for sure. This left me little choice then, but to escalate. I had to get her off-course, before she decided to go digging.

I couldn’t get her on my side- pecking order was zero-sum. In her eyes, either you were first and found yourself showered with favors and items like new clothing, as I’d been the last few months, or you were as I’d been up until she’d left: Largely forgotten about.

So I just smiled and picked up my old German steel dinner knife and then tossed it in the air, feeling its weight and unworried about its dull edge, able to cut the butter. I felt my mother’s eyes on me. Then I made the move to throw it right at her head- except she didn’t flinch a tiny bit backward. Instead, she slammed her palms atop the old wooden planks, and acted like she was going to lunge out of her seat and across the table, ready to knock over the candles and scatter the carefully gathered seasonal centerpiece mother had made, lips peeled back in a wolven snarl.

Only Mother’s timely shout brought Jacqueline back down to her carved wooden seat, sending a surprised look over her way. One that I gave as well.

Father woke up with a startle. “Huh?” He asked, arms coming up as he blinked. “Hey!” He shouted- some force behind it this time, too. The first time I’d heard him even slightly put his foot down, too.

I glimpsed at the tiny pumpkin Jacqueline had knocked over when preparing to leap across the table at me. Surely, Mother had more worry than whether the centerpiece was disturbed. Since when had she ever cared whether Jacqueline was about to beat the shit out of me or not? Was I under aegis? Was this simply her taking Amilita’s order to heart? Had that been the cause of the slightly better clothing and care, or was there more at play?

Both Jacqueline and I exchanged a glance. This wasn’t over, just on pause. Why she decided the trouble was ‘not worth it’, I couldn’t quite say.

What I could say was this: The rules were changing.

I’d have to find a way to stay atop the game.

I folded up my napkin and put it in my chair, grabbed my bag, then stormed out of the house.

## Walkabout

For the first time in months, I had nowhere in particular to be- I'd already finished a surprise inspection of a site. I wanted to scope out the damage from the explosion, maybe do some kind of soliloquy for the fallen at Camp Death. Remind myself what it was all for.

*Who am I kidding, I’ve done more than enough speeches, and none of them ever led to anything good.*

Then again, art districts were popping up left and right as Delaware carved out a niche for itself. Sure, these weren’t ‘the jobs of the future,’ but we were doing alright, or at least I thought we were. We had even cemented the truce into something like a peace. They’d even turned the battleground into a memorial site.

Paying my respects seemed necessary, but also like something I’d been able to put off.

Now, I couldn’t stand to stay at home, and I wondered for the umpteenth time about the wisdom of maintaining any pretense of a life as Elias. School was about to start, and what would I do then?

Each step I took along the footpath from my neighborhood into the forest felt heavy with something not-quite-like-regret. The lush trees were either popping from their buds or freshly unfurled from the seasonal turn, and my capitalizing on the waxing daylight hours to make this outing meant the trunks of the trees still cast beams through long shadows. Somewhere, I heard a squirrel ‘squaw’ at a circling bird and the rustle of something small in the underbrush nearby. The woods were more alive than I remembered, with fish flitting about in the creek as I hopped across atop the rocks.

I came to the first trace of battle damage- where we’d nearly been caught, until Grey Mask had rescued us by sacrificing himself to take her down. The resulting explosion of her equipment had dug a hole in the railbed, visible even from down the embankment where new crushed ballast had been laid overtop, a slightly brighter grey color marking the repaired patch. I knew I was in the right spot, too, because underneath I saw the culvert we’d been trying to crawl through when we’d been spotted- half-submerged now after the recent spring rains.

*If only we’d gone to the side-* the stream had forked, and there was a bigger one, possibly left unguarded. Words like those haunted me- ‘possibly,’ all the ‘could have been’s.’ Maybe then Grey Mask would still be with us, and ‘possibly’ competently leading a front.

I began to climb the embankment, and saw more evidence of battle, where the forest still hadn’t fully healed itself.

A second-nature check for the new trolley wheeling its way along the tracks and then I was atop the rebuilt rails, gazing through a still-not-yet-regrown part that had been tramped down. From here, I was able to see some of the crater from where I stood on my tiptoes. The interstate had a few cars parked on its shoulder. Here was usually where George and I donned our masks- and then would dart across what now had a few smaller craters from the orbital bombardments.

Sliding down the opposite bank, I took a moment to wonder as to which rock I’d stood upon when I’d pressed the detonator. It had been dark, and though I’d made a brief moment of blinding daylight with the press of a button, I still couldn’t say. Had the aliens aggressively sifted through the rocks for remains or evidence, to the point where they’d been disturbed? I tried standing atop one, then the other, with some uncertainty, and then looking behind me, wondering which one I’d been blasted into by the pressure wave. I’d certainly taken a light concussion in the process, practically dragged home, which wasn’t helping me recall.

Arguably my greatest achievement, and yet I could only remember chunks of it.

Disappointment left a bitter taste in my mouth- would it come to me in time? Or would more slip from me? I had to hope my future held more moments, even as great and terrible as this one had been. I’d lost someone dear to me. I’d also slain my enemies and helped cement a peace with it.

Thoughts such as these preoccupied my mind and distracted me from where I was going until I was through the tunnel and standing there, guided on sure footing by a memory I could conjure only by being here again. Watchtowers had once stood approximately here, and men. Men with masks and guns. Men who cheered and fought, bled, and died for…no, not me, but for something else. Something greater. I’d said words- something about heroes. I was sure it had been recorded and broadcast, and that the shil’vati, or someone at least had a copy of it in some sense.

I could bother Pierce or Radio for it, I knew, but it sounded like they had their hands full without worrying whether their leader was growing into an egomaniac. In truth, I just wanted to know why it had worked. Whether it had all been worth it.

Before I knew it, I stood at the crater’s lip. Camp Death itself, formerly concrete tunnels, trenches and bunkers atop a hilly bluff, now more resembled a caldera. No trees yet grew here. Workers had combed and sifted for dangerous materials and dug for remains, tilling and tramping the disturbed soil over and over, and still a few sections that had yet to be cleared remained roped off.

Raising my omni-pad, I activated it and entered the suggested augmentation display. The pad floated up before my face, rotated itself ninety degrees, and turned transparent. I closed my eyes to not become disoriented from the effect, and when I opened my eyes again, I could look through the omni-pad like a window in time. The exhibit, in other words, lacked the usual plaques with sun-faded words in favor of something a bit different.

Apparently statues and such were more a human thing, pushing the viewer toward contemplation. Oh, there were a couple metal statues, one already in place where I could make out the rough geometric shape of its back situated on the crater’s far edge. That was where the orbital impacts had left their impact sites and demarcated the woods’ edge, and I told myself I’d work my way around to examine it.

Refocusing my gaze on the omni-pad screen, it seemed this was all reconstructed based off of the Marines’ helmet footage of ‘Heartbreak Hill,’ or ‘Camp Death,’ as it had been to me. The text display option brought up a *long* scrolling list in Shil’vati of all the names of the dead soldiers, starting with a couple lesser noblewomens’ who I didn’t recognize, then Azraea, followed by a bunch more names I did not recognize. It seemed her fall from grace had been fast- that, or the division between noblewoman and commoner was more severe than I’d realized. There were even a few human names, listed surprisingly highly, interspersed in what I had to suppose was some deliberate gesture.

I looked out and closed one eye to restore the actual view of the crater, before resuming the view of what the memorial had to show me. There was an option to turn on the battlefield footage, to fully immerse myself ‘in it,’ and I agreed to let it play after it warned me that my user-registered age would let me view the footage, but only with a warning.

My muscles tensed and breathing quickened as I was taken back to that day. I instantly heard the familiar cracks, whines, and explosions of battle as the speakers carefully calculated mismatched audio waves, simulating accurate origin points for the audio. Screams filled the air, along with dirt exploding. A half-transparent hill, now obliterated, flashed with the reports of rifle fire from where now I knew nothing stood. Total chaos.

Death.

Was that my legacy?

No, there was more. So much more.

I waved away the simulation to stare at the empty crater.

I hadn’t come here to flatter myself, had I? If I had, then I’d failed. Even standing here at the lip of my ‘greatest achievement’ did nothing to stroke my ego.

The takeaway was then either: ‘Pride doesn’t last,’ or, maybe: ‘the destruction wasn’t what I had to be proud of.’

The monument here was built to honor both of us, or at least that had been the idea when I’d insisted on the commemoration. Humanity deserved to be seen as more than we were. So maybe that was an accomplishment, after all.

In the distance, I could see a few shil’vati civilians.

Shared sacrifice. Honor gained for our sacrifices, and a begrudging acknowledgment of our capabilities as warriors. Even if we frustrated them by having aimed our best efforts at their throats, rather than joining the tip of their spear, they could no longer deny our potential, at least.

The omni-pad offered a few names in English, and when I selected it, identified features of the onetime fortress were distributed and laid out in a wireframe. A man began speaking, his deep voice even and solemn as he described the order of battle from this angle, cutting off as I walked along a path hardpacked down for visitors, one that led down the crater’s lip toward where the enemy soldiers had to charge across the clearing.

I turned the presentation back on as I traversed the lip of the crater, noting that there were a few cracked casements left, some of them apparently having been heaved and ejected from the fortress, the wireframe slowly winding back time and showing where they might have sat, then placing a few nondescript insurgents inside with railguns.

By now I could hear the other guests’ omni-pads, their own omni-pads as attached to their faces as mine. What a ridiculous appearance- like an enormous flat-faced scuba mask. It was a pair of girls by the quick glance I’d since learned to never let linger.

There was something to be said for permitting them here on our terms. So far, none had acted out of line, and I suspected Amilita was screening them first as a favor to us both. It was a good sign that neither of us wanted to rock the boat on this peace. Heck, maybe she even *liked* Emperor. Something to test in due time, of course. For now, I still had to maintain misdirection and treat her as an enemy in one life, and as a dear friend in the other.

Certain towns and blocks were off-limits entirely to all visitors, of course, though I’d made sure that they weren’t ones where we were up to anything. Additional scrutiny in those places pulled eyes away from where we *were* busily manufacturing things, and continuing on the war.

And for what?

St. Michael’s was going to restore its civics class and teacher, whose name I found that I could not even recall. I tried not to worry about whether some combination of the blast, Vaughn, and the rogue Lieutenant Goshen had knocked his name out of my head, and so I just shrugged it off. I’d re-learn it with the approaching school year, doubtless.

Between this, the jobs, the guests…I’d done a lot for humanity. Much to be proud of.

My footsteps slowed as I came around to the front and the omni-pad pinged to let me know I’d come to a spot where it had more footage to overlay.

I looked up the hill, and re-engaged it again, and gained a whole new appreciation for George and the sentries for bravely foraying out here between the waves of infantry who had tried and failed to take it. Survivors had doubtless been laying out here, staying close to the ground and either too scared or wounded to either fall back or charge in. Whatever was going wrong up there, I had no doubt of his courage, at least.

The view around me showed fallen bodies, and the camera showed shil’vati Marines downed, stepping over the wounded and dead, trying to advance up the hill even though they were already exhausted by the charge across the open field. Explosions, traps, and fire all around. The only way ‘out’ was ‘up,’ and yet that was where all the fire was. Anyone who dared try was cut down and became an obstacle to advancement.

Confused shouting took over for disrupted comms, and I realized for the first time just how completely reliant they were on their technology. One soldier in front kept raising her rifle up to her helmet, hoping the proximity would get them to connect rather than sighting down the length of the barrel. Another soldier did try, but the moment she poked her head around the corner she was spun to the dirt, then screaming out and clutching her shoulder, rifle sheared into chunks of metal, pieces of the shattered stock embedded into her flexifibre armor.

I turned the display off and turned, realizing I was now right next to the two shil’vati girls. They couldn’t be more than a year off from these soldiers, by my reckoning. It occurred to me how little I knew of their culture- I knew some bought their way out, but was it truly mass-compulsory, or was it an active draft even in times of peace, with a random allotment? Surely it was not the case that *everyone* went besides those who could pay not to. Some had ‘signed up,’ after all, so it only made sense that-

And I realized my eyes had lingered, and worse, that it had been noticed. I made sure to tap the omni-pad screen again- soldiers cutting and running in total retreat. Such a thing never made it to the holovids, I imagined. ‘Retreat’ was an inglorious term.

Worse, we hammered them where they gathered and ran- where the still-scarred crest of the hill stood bereft of vegetation, the tall grasses matted down by people coming and going from the site. Just as it had been, so it was now, and so it would remain.

I made my way around them, giving the alien guests a wide berth and aware of their eyes lingering on me. There was no need for adrenaline. In the time since, no incident had ever needed my intervention. They’d come here, and they’d learned we were more.

So why was my heart beating fast? Was it at the possibility, the potential for this to all go wrong?

I’d survived such possibilities before. Worse, even.

*Plenty of opportunities to know more loss, perhaps. What gain can there be without it?* There was no such thing as a ‘free lunch,’ after all.

Pride. Mourning. Both in one.

That’s what it was to live.

Joy and suffering.

## Vacation Plans

I got home and slipped up to the bathroom without incident and checked my omni-pad.

* *Off again with your friends without me?*

The message on the screen asked.

* *No.*

Natalie hadn’t turned me in, and had even helped me cover up my existence as the galaxy’s most wanted terrorist, but that didn’t mean she approved of my activities, either.

Especially now that we’d just spread out into the other states.

Even if she had settled her peace with that and was simply teasing me about it now rather than any amount of genuine suspicion and testiness, I just wasn’t in the mood. I couldn’t just leave her with a one-word answer, though. The young shil’vati noblewoman tended to take those the wrong way.

* *My sister’s back.*

The omni-pad got a call request, with a message attached:

* *Congratulations Elias! I know family reunification has been a big priority globally. Amilita asked me to tell her when that went through.*

I rejected the incoming call out of not wanting to be overheard- even if I missed her, I was scared of being a little too honest.

* *?*

It seemed Natalie had picked up the way to use it as a general query, a way to prompt me to get out of my head and actually respond.

I washed off the cleanser and patted my skin dry, then applied a toner. With fingers still wet I tapped into the omni-pad:

* *Lots of people are moving around.*

Or so I’d heard over dinner yesterday, not connecting the dots until just now. Countless tourists had ended up trapped in the countries they were visiting once the invasion began. Now the Shil’vati had greatly expanded the program, with similar levels of recourse as was offered to people evicted from suburban neighborhoods whenever the aliens deemed doing so ‘necessary’.

I supposed Jacqueline was just one more piece to fall back to ‘where she belonged.’ Either that, or now that New York had gone yellow, pending red, her college town had finally closed down its campus, leaving her with little to do but come here and screw up my life.

* *But isn’t it great? Your family’s back together!*

* *Not a happy reunion. We don’t get along.*

I decided to double-send before Natalie could get any bright ideas. Sometimes it was good, but in this delicate situation I wanted her as uninvolved as possible.

* *Don’t make a big deal out of it. Amilita’s a blink away from putting a guard back on me. I barely got her to rescind that after the peace was signed.*

That was putting it mildly.

* *Shit. Shit shit shit.*

What?

* *?*

No response.

A few seconds passed. Then almost a minute, still with no follow-up. What was that about?

*****

“Shit!” Natalie muttered to herself, pacing the room. “Shit shit shit…” There went claiming any credit for that as a birthday idea! She quickly brought up a shopping catalogue in another window- and then to her horror saw that she’d still had her microphone on auto-dictation, and slapped it off. Too late, he’d seen and responded:

* *?*

She started tapping away at the screen, and reviewed the translation.

* *I’m sorry to hear that you two don’t get along. So, this place you’re going to show me- tell me more about it?*

There. Smooth.

Her omni-pad pinged:

* *You mean all about how I owe you a trip?*

She smiled.

* *You did sort of blow up the only star fort in the state, and you promised to show me a castle.*

Not a moment passed before he was typing.

* *I told you, that wasn’t me! That blew up while we were in the hospital together, remember?*

‘That blew up.’ His occasional use of what she’d learned to call ‘passive voice’ made the event sound like a natural occurrence. Something attributable to no one in particular. ‘Oh, you know those old castles and forts, they just do that sometimes. Buckingham Palace explodes week-to-week. Totally normal.’

Her irritation stemmed more from its loss than anything else. Sure, that hadn’t *technically* been a castle, and had been called a ‘star fortress,’ despite being completely terrestrial. To Natalie none of that had mattered. Was it made of dried dirt, sand and stone? Did it have ports to shoot projectiles out of? Did it have a moat? Check, check, and check!

While it wasn’t quite as classical or beautiful as the ones in the books they’d read, she’d still wanted a video from there and now there never would be one!

“Aaaggh! I want to see a fort! A castle! Something!”

Her omni-pad chimed happily as it transcribed and sent the message.

“Fuck!”

*****

* *Fuck!*

I stared at my omni-pad and couldn’t contain the laugh that bubbled up as the messages came through one after the other.

* *It’s okay. I think there’s a few old forts around. I’m not sure how many are open, or getting used. Let me look into it, I’ll do a little research, and we can go later this week. How’s that?*

There. That would settle her down. Heck, if I picked the right place, then I could do two birds with one stone…

I heard the heavyset footsteps plod up the stairs. “Elias?” Dad asked from the other side of the door.

“Hey Dad,” I stifled a yawn, still scrolling through the omni-pad, and trying to balance the many things on my mind all at once. Best not to vocalize the insurgency, type whatever small talk Father wanted to Natalie, and then look up ‘where is George?’

“You excited for next month?”

I’d aged out of Talay, and with a referral of good behavior from Dr. Harriet in hand, I’d be going back to Saint Michael’s. Natalie would be home schooled, with the exchange student experiment seemingly deemed too dangerous to try again. The passes issued by Emperor seemed insufficient to convince anyone otherwise, at least for the time being.

I would be operating practically alone at Talay. Heck, I was practically operating alone here in Delaware, for that matter, my drop-in visits to the production facilities were entirely self-motivated.

Larry and Verns were gone. Vaughn was now an understudy of the spooks down in Maryland. George and Radio had gone with them, taking control of some of the fronts under a cover story of government-work-internships. Hex and Binary had vanished. All this had left me basically alone.

I was going to St. Michael’s again, even Jacqueline was back under the roof.

If I really wanted, I could pretend like the whole of last year hadn’t happened.

My omni-pad pinged and I smiled to myself.

*Almost. Not quite.*

“Yeah.”

******

I reviewed the debriefing. New Jersey had three whole squads wiped out, to a man. No feedback, just a casualty report. Nothing about any failures on the railguns, no word on whether someone had panicked in each, or even how they’d gone.

At a certain elevation, war became about numbers. I hated it. Each of them had someone who loved them. I hadn’t been able to bring myself to ride past Larry’s garage, and I found myself unable to take my eyes off Verns’s house, where George had set the door back into place, turned the key, and then left it all those months ago.

Now it seemed to beg ‘what for’? The men under his command were dying. Was it an especially capable general? Was the work too much for him? I didn’t have answers, or information, and the gruff lieutenant I’d entrusted with the state’s front wasn’t sharing them.

I began to search whether New Jersey had any fortresses.

Unsurprisingly, the information available was sparse. A lot of the internet had gone up in smoke with their data centers, gone dark from a lack of care, and that was just their online presence- who knew if what was left up was up-to-date or not. Some of the locations themselves had actually been strafed by gunships or dropships when desperate people had tried using them as redoubts. Or worse. Annapolis, West Point, and the other military academies had orbital rocks dropped on them, completely razed. Dover Air Force Base was now the center of the shil’vati garrison and administration. They’d settled in after they’d made a crater of the air traffic control and offices.

I finished my routine, and checked my ‘pass’ badge, then shook my head and called the liaison officer I’d been given.

“Elias, Hi!” She chirped, entirely too cheerfully and enthusiastically for it to be genuine. I’d never actually met this woman, all I knew was that Amilita insisted she was indispensable. The Shil’vati didn’t quite manage what Verns had called ‘*HR’s Sigh Out Every Sentence,*’ but this was certainly their equivalent of that. Overly soft tones, like speaking with an easily spooked animal.

“Hello, Lieutenant,” I turned the [natural grimace into an imperfect, thoroughly fake smile](https://i.imgur.com/LswH8ud.png). “I’ve been thinking about going up to New Jersey with Natalie, and seeing if there’s a fort there.”

Her smile took a slight freeze. “Which one were you thinking of?”

“That’s the thing, I haven’t the slightest idea which ones are still around, and which ones got destroyed. Do you know if Battery Gunnison is still open? To the public, I mean.”

“Why would you want to go there?” She tried, clearly unhappy about the idea but still maintaining the same kind of overly gentle tones with me like I was a small child who had to be steered.

“It’s a long story, but I owe Natalie a fortress visit.”

“In New Jersey?” She asked. “I think New York has a few, and that’s close by. There’s insurgent activity in both states, so could I recommend somewhere else?”

I knew it would be a triviality to ask the Rakten family for a lift. One of their flying cars could make it to the moon and back in an afternoon. Britain would be easy to accomplish and be back before the day was out, but George wasn’t in Britain, he was in New Jersey.

“No, no,” I said. “I’m quite happy with my decision. I’ve got my pass.” I tapped the laminated printout and stamped wax seal I’d given myself. Natalie had a similar one. And if those didn’t work, well, we’d have Morsh tagging along, plus some Marines the Liaison Officer was helping facilitate. “Is it open?”

“Just a quick check, and, well, while it’s unstaffed, it’s not technically closed, either.”

“Perfect!” I cheered. “Thanks, Lieutenant.”

“New Jersey’s not Delaware,” she reminded me. “I’m able to coax the local General into cooperating, but I can’t send a security cordon, and I really-” I let her drone on while typing the location to Natalie and comparing it to the location I’d written down.

Radio’s network was still active, and no one had ever figured out how to track anyone just passively *listening* to broadcasts. The location had taken me a minute to figure out using our codes and a few more with the omni-pad to piece together, but then I’d understood where George was and when he and I might meet.

The relay we’d arranged at Talay was still active. The [low-power NVIS system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_vertical_incidence_skywave) we’d set up at Talay was good at staying hidden, especially when on multiple relays, details of which even I wasn't fully informed on. Chatter had to be kept short and during waking hours- which we were well past by the time I’d gotten confirmation that someone had tapped ‘G-Man’ to let him know that ‘Big E’ wanted a word or two with him.

We’d worked through the blue box system from there, and finally arranged our meeting for today.

1mo2fkf,https://i.redd.it/78x6w2zpljif1.jpeg,"After finishing Ulysses, it's ""In Search of Lost Time"" now.","Wrapped in paper and time-- Proust is  home 📚📖💜

My obsession with Proust is not a recent affair but a deep-rooted curiosity. I've read about him through countless essays, articles and writings from readers who loved his work. Alain de Botton once wrote a book named ""How Proust can change your life"", which I read a few years ago. I also watched a few of his talks, nudging me enough to finally picking up Proust myself.

Most of what I've read in my reading life has been on my tablet. Because of transferable jobs, we're constantly on the move, so ebooks just made sense-- easy to carry, always accessible. Over the years, I'd grown used to screens.

But then came Proust.

Finished about 50 pages of ""In Search of Lost Time"", and I've realized-- this isn't the kind of book meant to be read on a tab. This isn't a work you just scroll through. The laid-back pace, the eloquence, the detail, the way his narration moves between time and memory-- honestly, it felt too rich for a screen. So when I came across the Penguin Clothbound Classics edition, I didn't even think twice, I just bought it. And when the three volumes finally arrived-- with their beautifully vibrant covers and all-- I felt something I hadn’t felt in a long time. A kind of euphoria-- Okay let's say, electric happiness. 🌟🌟✨😊 As if I was finally giving this monumental work the attention and respect it truely deserved.

I'd heard about Scott Moncrieff's translation for years-- how it captured the essence  and feeling of Proust's original-- and now I had it in my hands. There's something about holding an actual book, turning real pages and pausing wherever I want-- without the distractions of digital notifications, especially when reading someone like Proust. That's really something!! 

I've read 90% of my books on devices. But this-- this needed to be in paper. Some books are just like that. (Ulysses falls into the same category.) They long to be held, not just read. So... I'm finally diving into Proust,  sipping coffee, chasing memories and forgetting the world… one page at a time.📖

Is anyone else embarking on the same journey as me?

# Chapter 1

Fresh from her postpartum confinement, Amelia Austin took her newborn daughter to the Social Security Administration to register her Social Security Number.

“Hello, I’d like to register the name Finn Robinson for my baby.”

The clerk typed for a moment, then frowned deeper and deeper. “That can’t be right. There’s already a child named Finn Robinson listed under Edmond Robinson’s household registry.”

Amelia froze, thinking she’d misheard. “That’s impossible. Our daughter was only born a month ago!”

Before the words had fully left her mouth, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She unlocked the screen to see a message from Edmond’s assistant, Blanche Flores.

Attached was a photo—Edmond’s left arm wrapped around Blanche’s waist, his right cradling a boy who looked about five or six. The three of them were standing outside a kindergarten, smiling like the picture of domestic bliss.

Pinned to the boy’s chest was a school ID tag. “Finn Robinson,” it read, clear as day.

A message followed right after:

\[Miss Austin, how does it feel to be the other woman? You’ll spend the rest of your life living in the shadow of the real wife—me.\]

It felt like a steel vise had clamped around her heart. Amelia’s fingertips trembled as she spoke to the officer.

“Could you… check Edmond Robinson’s marriage record for me?”

The printer spat out a page. Though light, it landed in her hand with the crushing weight of a sledgehammer. In the “spouse” column next to Edmond’s name, it read: Blanche Flores. The marriage had been registered seven years ago.

“Ma’am, would you still like to proceed with your daughter’s registration?” the clerk asked. His voice felt like it came from miles away.

Amelia looked down at her baby, peacefully asleep in her arms, and forced a bitter smile.

“Register her under my name,” she said softly. “And… change her name, too.”

Amelia walked out of the station on legs that felt like jelly. Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Edmond.

\[Hey babe, still stuck in meetings. I’ll be home later to spend time with you and the baby.\]

“Babe.” She almost laughed.

He’d called her that every day of their marriage. He never forgot to check in when leaving for work or give her a hug when coming home. Every little act of tenderness, once so cherished, now felt like barbed wire.

Sliding into the driver’s seat, her hands shook so badly she couldn’t get the key into the ignition.

She’d always known how the world of the wealthy worked—most high-society couples played by their own rules. But Edmond had been the exception.

Once, at an event, when a young lady of note had insulted her in front of everyone, Edmond bankrupted her entire family the very next day and forced them to leave the city. He remembered her casually admiring a limited-edition boutique piece. That same night, he’d flown halfway across the globe to get it, just to make her smile.

But what haunted her most was the time of a hospital mix-up during a routine checkup. The nurse had handed him a report claiming she had late-stage kidney failure.

Edmond’s face had gone white. He grabbed the doctor’s coat and shouted like a madman:

“Take mine! Take both my kidneys! If she dies, I’m going with her!”

It turned out to be a mistake. And that cold, ruthless businessman had sat in the hallway, sobbing like a child:

“Thank God, Amy. You’re okay. That’s all that matters…”

People warned her: the more powerful Edmond became, the more temptations would surround him. But he’d always treated her so well, so earnestly, that doubt never had a place in her heart.

So why Blanche?

Edmond used to look down on her more than anyone. Blanche had been the Austins’ maid. One day, she brought Edmond coffee while wearing a low-cut dress.

He shattered the cup on the spot and barked:

“Don’t play cheap tricks in front of me. Don’t bother coming back tomorrow.”

Then he pulled Amelia into his arms, eyes burning with intensity.

“Amy, you’re the only one I want. I won’t tolerate filth like her around you.”

Blanche had crumpled to her knees, sobbing and begging for mercy.

“I only love Amelia. I don’t entertain garbage. Don’t ever show your face to me again.”

She’d packed up and left that same day.

A few months later, Edmond hired her back as his personal assistant. He told Amelia:

“She lost her job, and her family was going to marry her off to some old creep. She started threatening suicide. I’d rather keep her under my watch than risk her stirring up trouble.”

Amelia had believed him. Never would she have guessed that the two of them had been sneaking around under her nose for six whole years—and had a child together.

Clenching her jaw against the sting behind her eyes, Amelia called a private investigator.

Thirty minutes later, a video came in with a GPS pin. She drove straight to the location.

Edmond wasn’t in a meeting. He’d just come from Finn’s kindergarten parent-teacher conference.

Hand in hand with Blanche, their son in his arms, the three of them crossed the street like a picture-perfect family. The soft smile on Edmond’s face was more genuine than any family photo they’d ever taken—and it sliced through her like glass.

Amelia tailed them to a gated suburban villa.

She watched Edmond get out of the car first, lifting a huge box of toys from the trunk. The boy squealed in delight and ran off with the loot. Blanche leaned into Edmond, teasing, “You spoil him too much.”

“He’s my son. Who else should I spoil?” Edmond grinned and kissed her on the lips. “He won the most gold stars today. Made me proud.”

Blanche’s eyes welled up. “Thank you, Ed, for enrolling him in the best private school. I never thought…”

She hesitated, voice trembling. “When I got pregnant, it was an accident. I never planned to intrude. I only wanted to watch from afar. We were never going to ruin things for you and Amelia—”

“Stop it.” Edmond cupped her cheek, voice firm but low.

“She’ll never know. Besides, you are the one on my marriage license. Of course I’ll take care of you and Finn. You’re my family.”

Blanche finally smiled through her tears. Edmond leaned closer and murmured something in her ear that made her blush bright red. Then he swept her into his arms and carried her inside.

Amelia sat frozen in her car, feeling like her heart had been sawed open with a dull blade. She barely remembered how she drove back home.

That night, Edmond returned as usual. As soon as he stepped inside, he opened his arms for a hug.

“Babe, did you wait long? Tired from taking care of the baby today?”

Amelia quietly shifted to the side. “About our daughter’s registration…”

“I’ll handle that later,” he cut her off sharply. Then, softening his tone: “Those procedures are a nightmare. You just got through recovery—leave it to me, okay?”

She nodded, lashes lowered. She didn’t tell him their daughter was already registered under her name.

She also didn’t mention the call she made on the way home.

My Dad has ADHD, and I do act quite similar to how he does. I have a hard time paying attention to what people are saying if I'm not super interested in the topic so I have repeat almost every word they say in my mind to remember what they are saying. When I'm focused I either get distracted by stuff frequently or I am so focused that I become unaware of my surroundings. I have a bad habit of interrupting people because once I think of what I wanna say my brain is telling me to say it right there and then. I lose stuff a lot, like if I don't think in my mind where I put it when I set it down odds are I will forget where it's at and freak out as I tear the house apart looking for it. I do this thing pretty much everyday where I walk around in circles, bite my tongue or the inside of my cheek, breath loudly through my nose, and fidget or sometimes, flap my hands. According to my mom she suspected I had something since I was 3, because according to her I was a weird child. I didn't learn how to walk untill I was 1 which I barely did and had to be put into speech therapy because I couldn't speak when I was 3. I was a very hyperactive child, like running off the walls hyperactive. I remember always doddling one my school work and kicking my legs back and forth while sitting in class. Whenever my dad came home from work he would have me drink some of his coffee which would calm me down. Im sensitive towards touch, for example I don't like high-fives because even after it's long over I can still feel it and I hate the feeling, I dont eat many different types of foods because I don't like how it looks, smells, tastes, or feels, and I stopped taking a class that I did enjoy (woodshop) because a lot of the days the noise made me just want to leave and cry. The main time I feel calm is when I turn my brain off, no thoughts, nothing, or when I'm just tried. 

The reason why I was told I didn't is because I teacher I had said she didn't think I did. The thing is I was the quite kid (because I had sever stutter, I was very talkative before that and am now very talkative with friends and family afterwards) and I was in the back. I remember fidget like all the time in her class and having the urge just to move around. 

All of these aren't all of the time and some have become less outwardly noticeable as I got older, but these things happing is the norm and not the expectation for me. ",1,1754983980.0,neurodiversity,0,1.0,False

I view myself as confident, thoughtful, and straightforward. My busy lifestyle means I’m choosy about who I spend my time with.

Here’s a little about me: I don’t have a lot of time for social stuff; I work all the time. I have friends, I do stuff, but I’m always working when my friends are free. They are married and have kids—thrilled for them, but so vastly different from my own life; hence why I am here.

I enjoy reading—fiction, autobiographies, but mainly fiction; sleeping in on weekends; watching Netflix; exploring cafes; drinking iced coffee; and singing loudly to my music.

I am a night owl, and that probably won’t change. It's normal for me to drink Coca-Cola with lots of ice and listen to audiobooks or watch a series or a movie.

I am struggling on the topic of meals while trying to lose some weight. 
I have been trying to skip out on breakfast and try to make it directly to lunch. 
However I am seeing this as now not being sustainable at all for me because:

1. I crave sugar late mornings at work and then I buy a coffee or hot chocolate, and then a crossaint and most times even a chocolate crossaint 

2. While waiting for lunch I end up snacking like mentioned above and then I skimp out on lunch and end up eating less. 

3. I get ravenous around 5 and then have dinner super early. I think this is the best meal since I try to balance protein and fibre and it’s the most satiating meal for me

4. I get hungry before I sleep around 9 and then it’s a bad spiral. 

How can I plan my meals better? Some people mention intermittent fasting but I really struggle with that. I am also unable to really skip lunch so I don’t think I can only have breakfast and then skip lunch. 
I struggle daily with energy slumps as well as high sugar cravings.

In a nutshell: I met a wonderfully interesting, handsdome and pretty masc girl online in a capital of a west european country. We've been chatting for almost a month... time flew by. We moved off the dating app to another social network on her suggestion. She didn't offered her phone no. (some other women I chatted with did immediately). Recently, I've got the feeling that we are at a stalemate i.e. nothing too personal shared. At first, I flirted a bit and later she felt ok to do, as as well. Nothing outrageous. Early on she asked abt what I look for in a woman and I said and she said, too. My issue is that I am awkward about talking about personal stuff in messages e.g. what I want in relationship, in a woman etc. I sad I am more used sharing things and info over a drink or coffee, getting to know each other.
I panicked last night and decided to write and ask her out today. The problem is I don't know if she wants to chatt longer or to move. I don't have an issue with asking a girl out, but obvs I want maximazed chances of success. Anyone in UK, France, Holland, Belgium,Germany,Spain ... anywhere in the world what is the culture of asking out a woman from online to irl?... Thanks in advance.

My background: I am 40, figured out I liked women and prefer them to men some 2 yrs ago. So, I don't like boxes and labels, but understand neccessity for them. In this, I'd say I'm Bi. I never had an experience with a woman.  And I don't want to go around the bloke just so I tell the woman I like I have been with women before. This girl, let's say that I want to make her squirm in a good way and I don't even know her preferences in intimacy. I told my octogenarian parents, some friends not to be surprised if I bring a woman soon. The worst was my mom, but I can deal with her. I come from a conservative sotheast european country, where I work, but I reside in that country which is open-minded. If I move permanently, I'd have to take a paycut and literally start from scratch as I don't speak the local language fluently, so probably low paying jobs.
I want to tell all of this to a woman but irl not through messages.

Abt her: I am afraid she may not like my situation which would be normal. But more that she seems to have had an issue with a girlfriend who either experimented, or left her for a man but was already in a relationship. Given that I came out to myself and others at 38-40.. . (That's another post altogether) but with 2 previous  fleeting experiences with men might be a red flag. Don't know how to go abt that. Also, she is very educated, phd level like me, extremely interesting with lots of interests and friends, with a growing career, wants long term , has so many passions and is a rounded woman who is also several yrs younger than me.

1mo21mc,https://i.redd.it/oy46y4crhjif1.png,He left me broken. Now he's back—and his apology tastes like sin,"# Chapter 1 Let's End This

By the 7th year with Gavin Foster, Cecilia Jordan was ready to walk down the aisle. She had prepared her wedding dress, just waiting for him to pop the question.

They had shared every first, first crush, first kiss, first heartbreak, from college classrooms to office meetings. Somewhere along the way, Cecilia had disappeared into just being Gavin's girl.

Word had been going around about Gavin and that college girl he was helping out. Cecilia's friends warned her, but she ignored it, until her pre-marriage health checkup.

There was Gavin, who had said he was in meetings, holding some girl's hand during her blood draw. He fussed over that girl like she was made of glass, his face all soft with concern. Cecilia's fingers trembled as she crumpled the lab slip and dropped it in the trash.

\*\*\*\*\*

""Cecilia, Mr. Quinn's nephew is back from overseas. He's hoping to set up a meeting for you two."" On the phone, Cecilia's mother Lily Terry carefully brought up the subject. When Cecilia stayed silent, Lily quickly added, ""Unless you're not interested. I can always say no.""

""Mom, tell Mr. Quinn I'll meet his nephew,"" Cecilia said calmly. Lily paused in surprise. Last time, Cecilia had firmly refused it. ""I've switched divisions at work,"" Cecilia continued, ""so I'm not stuck at work late anymore. Just let me know the details when they're set.""

Hanging up the phone, Cecilia got out of the car with a designer shopping bag in hand. She had just picked up the gift from a high-end boutique downtown. Taking a deep breath, she straightened her dress and walked toward the hotel entrance.

The hotel's fifth-floor ballroom glittered with decorations. A lavish spread covered the buffet tables in honor of Stella Yates joining Foster Group. Dressed in white Dior with a sparkling tiara, Stella stood surrounded by admirers, just like a pampered princess.

The crowd started chanting ""Kiss! Kiss!"" as they nudged Stella toward Gavin. With a giggle, Stella linked her arms with Gavin for the champagne toast. But with two sips in, she was already swaying, tumbling right into Gavin's waiting arms.

Then someone spotted Cecilia entering and gasped her name, their face going rigid. The party noise died instantly. Flushed, Stella tried to wiggle free from Gavin's grip, but he pulled her closer instead, completely unbothered by Cecilia's arrival. ""You're late,"" was all he said about missing their appointment.

Cecilia offered a composed smile, blaming the heavy rain and bad traffic for her late arrival. Gavin barely glanced at her as he took the gift bag. Turning to Stella, his voice warmed, ""Remember my promise? A welcome gift for joining Foster Group."" With theatrical flair, he presented the velvet box.

Stella's eyes widened in shock, then immediately sparkled with delight. ""It's perfect. My absolute favorite!"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""Thank you, Gavin,"" she added, her gaze shining with adoration.

""Here, let me,"" Gavin murmured, taking her hand with unexpected tenderness. His face was strangely serious as he slid the ring onto her finger, the moment so intimate it could've passed for a marriage proposal.

Phones lit up across the room as the crowd eagerly snapped photos. ""That ring says it all,"" a voice called out. Others chimed in, ""Stella's clearly under Mr. Foster's protection now."" The crowd burst into cheers.

Gavin pulled Stella close, whispering in her ear, ""How should you thank me?"" Stella stood on tiptoe and kissed his cheek. With a doting smile, Gavin announced to everyone, ""Starting today, Stella will be my personal assistant."" Cecilia's breath hitched. Memories came rushing back.

\*\*\*\*\*

Cecilia was seven when Gavin moved in next door. The first time they met, he told her she was pretty and started coming over every day. He always held her hand and said, ""Cecilia, I'll protect you."" And he did. He never let anyone bully her, kept other boys away, and made sure she didn't date anyone.

On the night of her 18th birthday, after a glass of wine, Cecilia finally asked what she had always wondered. ""Why won't you let me date anyone?"" she demanded, cheeks flushed. ""I'm not a kid anymore, Gavin. I want to be with someone, like a normal girl.""

Gavin, deadly serious, cornered her in a secluded spot and declared, ""If you want to be with someone, it has to be me. I've waited eleven years for you. I won't let you be with anyone else, because I like you."" Their first kiss was awkward, all missed angles and nervous laughter, but it made her heart race anyway.

During college, she and Gavin were always together. When people made fun of him for being born out of wedlock, she stood up for him without hesitation. She even gave him a precious jade carving, helping him win some respect from the Foster family.

Later, her family lost everything. After her father died, her mother had to move her younger brother and her from their big house to a small, run-down home in the countryside. That same year, Gavin's real father finally claimed him, bringing him into the wealthy Foster family.

Everyone thought he would leave her. But when he won the university marathon, sweaty and breathless, he pulled her close and announced to the crowd, ""Cecilia's my girl. We're staying together until we're old and gray."" That was her happiest moment.

After graduation, she gave up the chance to study abroad and chose to work as Gavin's secretary at Foster Group. Day and night, she stayed by his side, supporting him as he secured his position as the heir. She looked forward to a future where they would marry, have children, and grow old together.

Then Stella appeared. That was when Cecilia realized the boy who had promised to marry her had never actually meant those words. Somehow, between then and now, his heart had strayed.

\*\*\*\*\*

""Cecilia, come help me cut the cake."" Stella called out with a bright voice as she hurried across the room. She held out a hand, her smile warm and inviting.

Cecilia stepped back, letting Stella's hand hang in the air. Her eyes turned frosty as she replied in a tone like chilled steel, ""No need. I want no part in your celebrations.""

Stella lowered her head, her eyes reddening. Gavin stepped forward immediately, his voice tight with irritation. ""Why take it out on Stella? It's her first day. Was getting her the gift she wanted so wrong? You're transferring out the moment she joins. Since when are you this petty?""

Before Cecilia could speak, Gavin took a black card from his wallet and shoved it at her. ""Enough drama,"" he snapped. ""Go get that Chanel bag you've wanted for a long time.""

A bitter laugh escaped Cecilia's lips. He had always known what she wanted, yet never cared enough to give it. Their childhood love had curdled into something sour. Seven years without a ring said everything. ""Let's end this,"" she whispered, voice cracking, eyes glistening with unshed tears.

Gavin's expression darkened, his voice sharp with irritation. ""You begged for marriage, now you're ending it? Throwing a fit over nothing? I won't baby you anymore. You chose this. Don't come crying later.""

""Fine."" Cecilia drew a shaky breath, steadying herself. Behind them, Stella's cheerful call for a group photo hung in the air, but Gavin didn't even glance back as he strode off.

\*\*\*\*\*

As Cecilia left the hotel, her phone buzzed with a WhatsApp notification. There was Stella's post in the company group, \[Best day ever. Found my person.\], and a photo showing her surrounded by gifts with Gavin's ring front and center.

Beneath the photo, Stella had deliberately tagged Cecilia with \[Thanks u/Cecilia\]. A hollow laugh escaped Cecilia's lips. The old sting was gone. She tapped the thumbs-up icon, exhaled, and closed the app without looking back.

\*\*\*\*\*

At around 3 am, Gavin staggered through the door, reeking of alcohol. The lights were still on—clearly, Cecilia had returned and was waiting for him. ""Cecilia, I drank too much. My head hurts. Give me a massage."" He collapsed onto the living room sofa and fell asleep instantly.

\*\*\*\*\*

The next morning, Gavin's assistant called, jerking him awake. ""Mr. Foster, it's 8:30. You missed the morning meeting."" Gavin squinted at the clock, rubbing his pounding head, 'Where's Cecilia? She never forgets my schedule.'

""Cecilia?"" He searched through every room, but found them all empty. For a brief moment, he stood stunned, but then let out a dismissive scoff. ""I've been too soft on her,"" he muttered. ""Let her stew for a few days. She'll come begging soon enough.""

# Chapter 2 The Swan Song

The bathroom was quiet except for the dripping faucet. Gavin toweled off and automatically reached for his clothes, but found nothing on the hook. For years, Cecilia had always hung his clothes there, neatly prepared. Now the bare hook just reminded him she was gone.

He hesitated just a moment before heading to the closet. Putting on his suit, he tried two different ties, but neither looked right. Annoyed, he ripped them off and left his collar hanging open.

Then he went downstairs, only to find the kitchen cold and empty, with no steaming coffee or plates set out. Lips pressed tight, he left for work without eating.

\*\*\*\*\*

In the CEO's office, Frank Murphy did a double-take. He never saw his boss eating at his desk before. Leaning in, he said, ""Mr. Foster, the morning meeting has been canceled as instructed. Ms. Yates is starting today. I've got her set up by your office. She'll be handling your schedule from now on.""

Gavin looked up, his gaze catching on Stella in her navy suit. His hand stopped in the air. For a second, he could almost see Cecilia sitting in her usual spot by the window.

Shaking off his thoughts, Gavin cleared his throat and gave Frank a half-hearted nod. ""Right."" The word came out flat as his eyes drifted back to his own desk.

Frank passed Gavin the project team list for the upcoming exhibition. As Gavin scanned the document, Cecilia's name jumped out at him from the planners' section.

He frowned at the paper. ""The Jewelry Exhibition is one of our toughest projects this year."" Tapping the file with his pen, he added, ""Since when does Cecilia handle event planning? She's pushing herself too hard just to prove something.""

Gavin seemed to have forgotten that he and Cecilia both graduated from Aletheia University. ""Well, when she can't handle it, she'll realize the secretary team is where she fits best."" He tossed the file aside. ""Keep her old desk available, Frank.""

\*\*\*\*\*

Cecilia silenced her sixth alarm and finally woke at 10 am, every muscle protesting last night's moving chaos. She had worked until dawn, calling in her best friend for emergency help, scrambling to hire last-minute cleaners, hauling boxes until midnight, before finally collapsing in her new villa.

Years back, Cecilia had hoped to reclaim her family's foreclosed villa, but Gavin's last-minute schedule change made her miss the auction.

As an apology, he bought her this quiet villa instead. She furnished every inch of the place, though she never actually stayed there. Just having her name on the deed gave her a security nothing else could.

She had more than just the villa. There was also a downtown apartment and a BMW coupe. When the relationship ended, she took everything that belonged to her, no apologies, no explanations.

She wasn't about to play the self-sacrificing fool just to make some grand gesture. What was hers stayed hers, simple as that.

In the kitchen, Cecilia cooked breakfast with her phone on speaker. ""Hello, I'd like to cancel the wedding dress I previously ordered. There's no need to deliver it. Please dispose of it for me. Thank you.""

Her best friend, Chloe Norris, walked in yawning, her throat parched. Cecilia pushed a warm mug toward her with an understanding look. ""Morning. Made you some honey water."" Chloe cradled the mug in both hands, smiling her thanks.

After listening to Cecilia's sudden breakup story the night before, Chloe had ranted about that jerk for hours until her voice went hoarse. She checked the clock and rasped, ""Shouldn't you be at work? Did Foster Group go under or what?""

""I'm with Project Division now, finally getting proper weekends off. And I think I'm going to quit."" Cecilia set down plates with sandwiches, flashing a tired but genuine smile. ""Fridge is bare, but this'll do for now.""

Chloe took an eager bite, her eyes lighting up with surprise. ""Even your sandwich tastes amazing,"" she mumbled through a full mouth, crumbs tumbling onto her lap. She quickly brushed them away before leaning in curiously. ""So what's the plan after quitting?""

Cecilia's fingers trembled slightly as she traced the edges of the faded family photo. Taking a shaky breath, she whispered, ""I haven't designed a single piece since Dad died."" A determined glint flashed in her eyes as she straightened her shoulders. ""But maybe now it's the time to try again?""

Chloe's eyes lit up as she seized Cecilia's hands, her grip warm and insistent. ""Of course,"" she exclaimed, her voice bubbling with excitement. ""The Jordan family used to be the top jewelry name in Kingsford. Your hands were made for designing, not cooking for some man.""

Chloe's excitement was infectious. Cecilia felt it too, her eyes lighting up with new possibilities. ""What if we opened our own studio?"" she ventured, then bit her lip. ""I would need a partner, though my savings won't quite cover everything yet.""

""Took you long enough to ask,"" Chloe chuckled, her eyes dancing. ""After my divorce, I took half that bastard's fortune. The interest alone keeps me comfortable. I believe in your talent. I'll handle the startup money. Let's go big or go home.""

Chloe immediately picked up her phone to order champagne and flowers. The celebratory pop of the cork signaled their new beginning.

Still in their pajamas, they clinked glasses with exaggerated formality, pretending to toast their future fortunes. Then they collapsed into laughter and a tight embrace.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

On Monday, Cecilia caught bits of restroom gossips before the meeting. Two colleagues were whispering that her transfer to Project Division looked like a demotion, especially since Gavin had brought in some bright young girl as his new secretary.

Cecilia shoved the stall door open with a loud bang. The two gossiping women at the sinks froze, one with lipstick smeared across her teeth, the other clutching a half-applied mascara wand in stunned silence.

Meeting their startled reflections in the mirror, Cecilia simply walked past without a word. There was no point arguing with office gossips. They would only twist your words anyway.

\*\*\*\*\*

Cecilia's exhibition plan showed real thought and attention to detail, surprising Project Manager David Zachary, who had assumed she was just another pretty face.

When she handed in her resignation, David frowned. ""Quitting so soon after transferring? At least think it over.""

""Just personal reasons,"" Cecilia said with a quiet smile. ""But don't worry, I'll see the exhibition through to the end.""

She had set a 30-day reminder on her phone. This final month would be her professional swan song, a chance to leave on her own terms with every project completed properly.

\*\*\*\*\*

At the dinner party, Gavin stumbled out drunk, cigarette dangling from his lips as he dialed. When his Maybach arrived, only assistant Frank stepped out. One friend, Charles Lewis, asked in confusion. ""Where's Cecilia? She always picks you up.""

""Ms. Jordan isn't Mr. Foster's secretary anymore,"" Frank explained. Every head turned toward Gavin, clearly wondering if something had gone wrong between him and Cecilia.

They all knew Gavin and Cecilia had been planning their wedding just weeks earlier. This sudden split didn't make any sense.

Gavin's expression soured as the alcohol's warmth drained from his face. ""She overreacted to some stupid misunderstanding,"" he muttered, grinding his cigarette into the pavement. ""If she wants to break up, fine. But I'm not begging her to come back.""

Charles shook his head in disbelief. ""You two grew up together. You can't throw that away over some petty argument."" Pulling out his phone, he added, ""Let me talk to Cecilia, I'll smooth things over.""

He put the call on speaker before saying, ""Cecilia, Gavin had drunk too much. Can you come pick him up? I'll text you the location.""

The line went silent for a few seconds before Cecilia's voice came through, steady and final, ""Not my responsibility anymore. Get someone else to babysit him."" The abrupt click of the call ending left the group stunned.

Gavin's lips curled in amusement. ""Don't you see?"" he said, eyes glinting with smug satisfaction. ""This breakup is just her way of forcing me to chase her. Now you called her. She would take it as surrender. Your 'help' is only making her dig in harder.""

Xavier Tate, always trying to keep the peace, ventured carefully, ""But what if she's serious this time? She only got jealous because she still cares.""

Gavin brushed off the concern with a dismissive hand, absolutely certain Cecilia would come begging. The other guys all nodded in agreement, laughing at the ridiculous idea that Cecilia would ever actually leave Gavin for good.

\*\*\*\*\*

Cecilia's phone buzzed with an incoming text. It was a message from her mother, \[Cecilia, your date is tomorrow at 7pm, Peninsula Café. Are you free?\]

She quickly replied that she would be there right on time, and then set her phone aside. The message had come sooner than expected, but perhaps this was exactly what she needed—a fresh start.

# Chapter 3 The First Meeting

This was Cecilia's first blind date. To make a good impression, she stopped by her apartment after work—washed her hair, slipped into a soft blue dress, dabbed on just enough makeup to freshen up. With everything ready, she finally stepped out the door.

As Cecilia arrived at the café, her phone buzzed with a text from her mom, \[His name is Henry Quinn, 28 years old, works in marketing at an international company with a 15K monthly salary. He's 178cm, average build, ordinary-looking, a bit shy. He'll be waiting with a white rose on the table. Good luck!\]

Cecilia pressed her lips together to suppress a chuckle. 'Seriously?' she thought. 'A white rose as some secret signal? Why couldn't Mom just send his photo like a normal person?'

Cecilia walked into the café. It was not too busy for a weekday evening. Near the window, a man in a dark suit sat waiting, a fresh white rose standing in the water glass before him.

Swallowing her nerves, Cecilia straightened her shoulders and walked over. ""Hi, I'm Cecilia Jordan,"" she said, offering a small smile.

The man was leaning back comfortably in his chair, casually checking stock prices on his tablet. At her introduction, his fingers paused, and he slowly looked up. The moment their eyes met, Cecilia froze.

The man sitting before her wore a perfectly fitted suit that screamed expensive taste. His sharp eyes looked calm on the surface, but Cecilia could sense something hotter hiding underneath, like a banked fire waiting to flare up.

Cecilia blinked in surprise. 'This is what Mom considers average? The guy belongs on a magazine cover.' She suddenly realized she had been staring too long when he still hadn't spoken. ""Excuse me, are you my blind date?""

Simon Hall glanced up briefly, a faint smile touching his lips. ""Yes. Please have a seat, Ms. Jordan."" His voice was calm and measured as he gestured toward the empty chair across from him, his movements deliberate yet effortless.

Cecilia settled into her chair, noticing a half-empty coffee cup already on the table. A quick check of her watch confirmed her punctuality.

Simon caught her glance before she could speak. ""I came a bit early,"" he offered casually. ""What can I get you to drink, Ms. Jordan?""

Cecilia was surprised by how attentive he was. ""I'll look at the menu,"" she said, settling on mocha and cake.

## Key features Analysis

The enduring appeal of cast iron tea kettles lies in their robust construction, exceptional heat retention, and ability to enhance the tea brewing experience. Below, we delve into the key features that define the best cast iron tea kettles of 2025.**Material and Construction:** high-quality cast iron is the foundation of any excellent tea kettle. The best models are crafted from heavy-duty cast iron, ensuring even heat distribution and exceptional durability. Look for kettles with a thick base and walls, which contribute to superior heat retention and reduce the risk of hot spots. The enamel coating on the interior is also an important factor. It should be food-grade and resistant to chipping and cracking, and it prevents rust formation while also influencing the kettle's aesthetic appeal.

**Heat Retention and Distribution:** Cast iron's remarkable heat retention properties are a major advantage for tea brewing.Once heated, the kettle retains heat for an extended period, maintaining a consistent water temperature essential for optimal tea extraction. This ensures that the tea leaves release their full flavor and aroma. The uniform heat distribution minimizes the risk of scorching the water, preserving the delicate taste of certain tea varieties. Some kettles boast heat retention properties that keep the water warm for an hour or more after boiling.

**Enamel Coating:** The interior enamel coating is essential for preventing rust and corrosion, common concerns with raw cast iron. This lining is typically applied in multiple layers to ensure complete coverage and durability, creating a non-reactive surface that prevents the metallic taste of iron from seeping into the water. Selecting a kettle with a high-quality, chip-resistant enamel coating ensures a long lifespan and preserves the water's purity. Check product specifications to verify that the enamel is lead-free and cadmium-free.

**Spout Design and Pouring:** The design of the spout is critical for drip-free pouring and overall usability.Kettles with a well-designed spout provide a smooth, controlled pour, preventing spills and splashes. Look for spouts that are angled appropriately and feature a wide opening for easy filling. Some kettles incorporate a removable infuser, allowing you to brew loose-leaf tea directly in the kettle. The infuser's mesh should be fine enough to prevent tea particles from escaping into the water.

**Handle and Grip:** The handle of a cast iron tea kettle should be ergonomic and heat-resistant. Many kettles feature a foldable handle for convenient storage. A agreeable grip is essential for safe pouring, especially when the kettle is full of hot water. Some handles include a heat-resistant material or coating to protect your hands from burns. The size and shape of the handle should accommodate various hand sizes.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** Cast iron tea kettles come in various sizes,typically ranging from 20 to 40 ounces. Choosing the appropriate capacity depends on your individual needs and the number of people you typically brew tea for. Consider dimensions as well and if it fits underneath your tap. A smaller kettle is ideal for single servings, while a larger kettle comfortably caters to gatherings. Be sure to consider the overall dimensions of the kettle, especially if you have limited countertop space.

Key features of best cast iron tea kettles:

* High-quality cast iron
* Even heat distribution
* Durable enamel coating
* Well-designed spout
* Ergonomic handle

## Core Benefits

Cast iron tea kettles offer more than just a visually appealing addition to your kitchen. Their unique properties provide several benefits over other types of kettles.

**Exceptional Water Temperature control:** The superior heat retention of cast iron allows for exceptionally consistent water temperatures, crucial for brewing the perfect cup of tea. Unlike stainless steel kettles that cool down rapidly, a cast iron kettle maintains the ideal brewing temperature for an extended duration. this is especially beneficial for delicate teas that require specific temperature parameters, such as green or white teas.

**Enhanced Flavor Extraction:** The consistent water temperature facilitated by cast iron kettles promotes optimal flavor extraction from tea leaves. By maintaining a steady heat, these kettles ensure that the tea leaves release their essential oils and aromatic compounds, resulting in a richer and more flavorful brew. The even heat distribution also prevents the bitterness that can occur when water is overheated.

**Durability and Longevity:** Cast iron is renowned for its exceptional durability, making these kettles a long-term investment. With proper care, a cast iron tea kettle can last for generations. The robust construction withstands the rigors of daily use, resisting dents, scratches, and other forms of damage. The sturdy build quality ensures that the kettle remains a reliable kitchen companion for years to come.

**Aesthetic Appeal:** Cast iron tea kettles possess a timeless charm that adds a touch of elegance to any kitchen setting. Available in a variety of colors and designs, these kettles serve as both a functional appliance and a decorative accent. Their rustic yet refined aesthetic enhances the overall ambiance of the kitchen, creating a welcoming and visually appealing space.

**Natural Iron Supplementation (limited):** While not a primary benefit, it is worth noting that older, uncoated cast iron kettles, and even some modern kettles with a thin enamel coating, may leach trace amounts of iron into the water.For individuals with iron deficiencies, this can provide a minor source of supplemental iron. Though, this effect is minimal and shouldn't be relied upon as a significant source of iron.

Here's how it works and how to navigate it mindfully:

---

### **Caffeine's Dual Effects on Focus & Zen Practice**
#### 🔹 **The ""False Clarity"" Trap**
- **Short-term boost**: Caffeine blocks adenosine (a calming neurotransmitter), increasing dopamine and adrenaline. This creates a sense of urgency and heightened importance around tasks—even trivial ones.  
- **The distraction spiral**: By amplifying neural ""noise,"" caffeine makes it harder to discern *what truly deserves attention*. You may feel productive while actually jumping between tasks (e.g., checking emails compulsively).  
- **Science confirms**: Studies show caffeine improves simple focus (like reaction time) but *reduces performance* on complex tasks requiring sustained attention or creativity.

#### 🔹 **Why Caffeine Conflicts with Zen**
1. **Hijacks presence**  
   Zen emphasizes observing thoughts/emotions *without attachment*. Caffeine’s artificial urgency amplifies mental chatter (""I must finish this NOW!"")—making it harder to anchor in the present.  

2. **Creates striving, not flow**  
   Zen’s *wu-wei* (effortless action) arises from calm alignment. Caffeine forces alertness through stress hormones (cortisol), breeding mental friction. Result: You ""try harder"" but feel more drained.  

3. **Disrupts body-mind harmony**  
   Zen integrates physical stillness and awareness. Caffeine’s jitteriness, increased heart rate, and post-crash fatigue fracture this mind-body connection.  

4. **Amplifies attachment**  
   The craving for caffeine (""I need this to function"") reinforces dependence—the opposite of Zen’s non-grasping.  

---

### **A Zen-Informed Approach to Caffeine**
#### 🌿 **Mindful Adjustments**  
- **Dose lightly**: ≤100mg (1 cup coffee) avoids overstimulation. Green tea (with L-theanine) offers smoother focus.  
- **Timing matters**: Use caffeine *only* for critical tasks—not daily rituals. Avoid after noon to protect sleep (vital for mental clarity).  
- **Pair with grounding practices**:  
  - Sip matcha slowly while breathing mindfully.  
  - Walk outdoors after coffee—let movement metabolize agitation.  

#### 🧘 **Deepening Focus Without Caffeine**  
1. **""Just sit"" (Zazen) before tasks**  
   - 5 minutes of breath-focused meditation resets your nervous system. *Replaces caffeine’s artificial alertness with natural presence.*  

2. **Single-tasking as ritual**  
   - Do *one* thing with full attention (e.g., ""I am only writing this email""). Notice when caffeine urges you to multitask—gently return.  

3. **Embrace low-energy phases**  
   - Zen honors natural rhythms. When energy dips:  
     - Rest without guilt (a 10-minute nap).  
     - Shift to gentle tasks (tidying, walking).  
     *No need to ""fix"" fatigue with chemicals.*  

4. **Question cravings**  
   - When reaching for caffeine, ask: *""Is this serving my clarity or my avoidance?""* Often, we stimulant to escape boredom or discomfort.  

---

### **The Wisdom in Your Observation**
Your insight that caffeine ""increases how important some things feel"" reveals a key truth: **What *feels* urgent is rarely what *is* essential.** Zen cuts through this illusion by returning you to the simplicity of the present moment—where focus arises naturally, without force.  

> ""Tea is a meditation.  
> Coffee is a transaction.  
> Choose the cup that quiets the mind.""  
> —*Adapted from Thich Nhat Hanh*  

If you experiment, notice: Does caffeine make you *busy* or *aware*? The path to Zen isn’t about adding intensity, but subtracting distraction. Let your practice—not the drug—be your guide. ☁️🍵",0,1754982895.0,decaf,2,0.33,False

In my dream, I’m living in a beautiful house that looks like some kind of apartment or condo. I’m not completely sure, but my best guess is that it’s an apartment because of how it looks inside. I’m in the drawing room/living room, and straight ahead from there, there’s a big, spacious balcony. Outside the balcony, there’s a large tree with long green leaves. I couldn’t identify what kind of tree it was, but judging by the leaves, it seemed like a coconut tree.

Inside the drawing room/living room, there are lots of expensive-looking decorative items-a large, modern dining table, a table lamp, a sofa, and a beautiful giant painting with a golden-colored frame behind the sofa-along with many other things I didn’t pay much attention to, except for the ones I’m mentioning here.

My mom is also in the same room, cleaning something-I’m not sure what. Suddenly, she asks me when the order is arriving. I’m like, “What order?” She replies, “Did you forget again? You ordered some furniture online.” Then I suddenly remember placing an order from a website. I check the site and see that I bought a piece of furniture and got two chairs plus four other furniture items for free. The price was listed as 2000-I couldn’t tell which currency.

Then the main doorbell rings-my delivery has arrived. When I open the parcel, which is very neatly packaged, I find furniture in shades of white, off-white, skin-white, and butter color. This is strange because the color on the website was a bit different. The furniture also looks thin, weak, and made from low-quality wood. Some pieces appear shiny and strong on the outside, but when I touch them, they feel weak, low-quality, and rotten inside. The chairs and stool even feel wet, so I assume they must have been stored in a warehouse where rainwater got in, and the wood absorbed it. The weather hadn’t been good for the last couple of days, so that made sense to me.

After a few minutes, some of the furniture starts breaking. One chair’s legs bend without anyone even sitting on it. Confused, embarrassed in front of my mom, and frustrated, I check another chair. When I grab one of its legs to test its strength and try to bend it-without even applying much force -it breaks easily, like something very soft. I’m like, “What the hell is happening?!” Thinking I might have made a mistake, I go back to the website and see that the price tag now shows 4000 instead of 2000, which means I actually paid 4000-not 2000-so I had been scammed.

The items listed are still the same: one main piece of furniture, two chairs, and four other free items. I start inspecting them all, and to my surprise, only one is of good quality-the wooden stool, which turns out to be a mini coffee table that perfectly matches my sofa. My mom is still complaining, criticizing me, and showing her frustration over the bad-quality furniture I bought. I try to explain that I only purchased the coffee table and that the rest came free, so even if they’re bad, we could still use them for something else-like burning them for firewood.

After saying this, I start walking toward the balcony from the drawing room/living room. As I get close, I suddenly see a bright white light-and then I wake up.

In this dream, I only clearly saw the coffee table and the two chairs. I’m not sure what the four other free items were, but one of them looked like a dining table. I couldn’t tell how many chairs it came with.

That’s not sci-fi anymore. It’s agent-led buying, and the tech giants are already sprinting toward it.



✅ The Players Making it Happen



🔹 OpenAI kicked things off in January 2025 with Operator, an AI agent that uses its own browser to interact with the web — filling forms, placing orders, and completing other tasks. It’s not perfect yet (CAPTCHAs and logins still throw it off, and sometimes it splurges on “fast delivery” without asking), but it’s a proof of concept for fully autonomous online shopping.



🔹 Google and Amazon are hinting at expanding their assistants to handle actual purchases.



🔹 Apple is quietly building its AI suite, Apple Intelligence, with one big advantage: tight integration into apps, strong privacy positioning, and a built-in wallet infrastructure that could make secure agentic buying seamless.



✅ The Money Problem — and How Startups Are Solving It



Giving an AI agent your credit card number is… unsettling. What if it buys a $3,000 espresso machine when you just wanted coffee beans?



That’s why control is the missing puzzle piece.



🔹 Skyfire (backed by Coinbase Ventures) assigns each AI agent its own digital wallet. You fund it with a set amount, and the agent can only spend what’s inside. Skyfire has already processed payments between AI agents and businesses, including large-scale financial services.



🔹 Stripe launched Stripe Issuing in late 2024, enabling developers to create single-use virtual cards with spend limits. AI search platform Perplexity is already using it for its “Buy with Pro” service, giving agents the keys to spend — but only within guardrails.



✅ The Big Strategic Question



Will consumers trust platform-specific agents (like Amazon’s Rufus) that are deeply integrated but potentially biased toward their own ecosystem?



Or will they prefer independent agents (like OpenAI’s Operator or Google’s Gemini) that can shop anywhere, bypassing retailer upsells?



This isn’t just a consumer choice — it’s a battleground for merchants, banks, and payment providers.



✅ Why Businesses Should Care Now



If you’re in e-commerce, banking, or payments, waiting on the sidelines isn’t an option. Partnering with AI agent infrastructure leaders today means:



Ensuring your platform is “agent-ready” — data clean, APIs accessible, payments seamless.



Building the foundation to launch your own AI agent that serves your customers directly.



Because when your customers’ buying decisions start getting made by algorithms, you want to make sure you’re in the conversation — or in this case, in the agent’s command queue.

## Key Features Analysis

The best 5-cup coffee machines of 2025 boast a range of features designed for convenience, quality, and longevity. Let's delve into the key specifications that set these brewers apart.

**Programmable Timer**

A programmable timer is a must-have feature for busy mornings. This allows you to set the machine to automatically begin brewing at a specific time, so you can wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Expect models in 2025 to offer enhanced programmability, allowing you to set different brewing times for different days of the week.

**Automatic Shut-Off**

Safety and energy efficiency are paramount. An automatic shut-off feature turns the coffee machine off after a set period of inactivity,typically ranging from 30 minutes to 2 hours. This not only prevents potential hazards but also conserves energy, reducing your electricity bill.

**Water Filtration**

Water quality considerably impacts the taste of coffee. Machines equipped with water filtration systems remove chlorine, calcium, and other impurities from the water, resulting in a cleaner, more flavorful brew. Look for models that use replaceable filters, and consider the availability and cost of replacement filters when making your decision.

**Pause and Serve Function**

For those who can't wait for the entire brewing cycle to complete, a pause and serve function is invaluable. This feature allows you to temporarily stop the brewing process to pour a cup of coffee mid-cycle without making a mess. The machine automatically stops dripping while the carafe is removed, preventing coffee from spilling onto the warming plate.

**Compact Design**

Space is often a premium in smaller kitchens. Five-cup coffee machines are inherently compact,but some models are designed to be even more space-saving.Consider the dimensions of the machine and whether it will fit comfortably on your countertop without taking up too much valuable space.

**Thermal Carafe Option**

While many 5-cup coffee machines use glass carafes with warming plates, some models offer thermal carafes. Thermal carafes are insulated to keep coffee hot for hours without the need for a warming plate, which can sometimes scorch the coffee and alter its flavor over time. If you prefer to savor your coffee over a longer period, a thermal carafe is a worthwhile upgrade.

Key features of the best 5-cup coffee machines include:

* Programmable timer
* Automatic shut-off
* Water filtration
* Pause and serve function
* Compact design
* Thermal carafe option

## Core Benefits

The core benefits of using a 5-cup coffee machine extend beyond simply brewing a small batch. These machines offer practical advantages in terms of efficiency, convenience, and cost-effectiveness.

**Reduced Coffee Waste:** Unlike larger coffee machines that brew excessive amounts of coffee that often go to waste, a 5-cup coffee machine allows you to brew only what you need. This reduces coffee waste, saving you money on coffee grounds and contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

**Faster Brewing Time:** Smaller capacity translates to quicker brewing times.Five-cup coffee machines typically brew a full pot in under 10 minutes, making them ideal for busy mornings when time is of the essence. This faster brewing time ensures you can enjoy your coffee without a long wait.

**Easy Maintenance:** With fewer components and a smaller size, 5-cup coffee machines are generally easier to clean and maintain than their larger counterparts. Many models feature dishwasher-safe carafes and removable parts, simplifying the cleaning process. Regular descaling is also essential to maintain optimal performance, and it is indeed a straightforward process with most 5-cup machines.

**Perfect for Solo or Small Households:** These machines are specifically designed for individuals or small households with only one or two coffee drinkers.This ensures that you always have the right amount of coffee without over brewing. It's the perfect solution for those who want a fresh pot without unnecessary extras.

**Space-Saving Footprint:** In smaller kitchens,counter space is valuable. Their compact footprints allow them to fit easily on counters without consuming a lot of real estate. This provides more surface for other appliances or meal planning.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions helps clarify the nuances of using a 5-cup coffee machine.

**How often should I descale my 5-cup coffee machine?**
Descaling frequency depends on the hardness of your water. In areas with hard water, descaling every 1-3 months is recommended. In areas with soft water, you may only need to descale every 6-12 months. Signs of needing descaling include slower brewing times, weaker coffee, and unusual noises during operation.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee or do I need to grind my own beans?**
You can use either pre-ground coffee or freshly ground beans in most 5-cup coffee machines. However, grinding your own beans just before brewing will result in a fresher, more flavorful cup of coffee. If using pre-ground coffee, store it in an airtight container to maintain its freshness.

**What type of coffee filter should I use?**
most 5-cup coffee machines use standard paper filters, typically cone-shaped or basket-shaped depending on the machine's design. Some models may also be compatible with reusable filters made of mesh or nylon. paper filters are disposable and offer good filtration, while reusable filters are more environmentally friendly and can save you money in the long run.

**What is the best coffee-to-water ratio for a 5-cup coffee machine?**
A general rule of thumb is to use two tablespoons of ground coffee per six ounces of water. Since a ""cup"" on a coffee maker is often measured at 5 oz, adjust accordingly. For a 5-cup machine,you might use approximately 8-10 tablespoons of ground coffee. Adjust the ratio to your personal taste preference for a stronger or weaker brew.

""You didn't know because you didn't answer your phone. For three hours, Jack. I was in the hospital for three hours, thinking our daughter might be coming early, and I couldn't reach my husband because he was taking care of his ex-girlfriend.""
The guilt was overwhelming. I'd left my pregnant wife to rely on my best friend while I held another woman's hand.
________________

I'd never seen Jack check his phone during dinner before.
The thought flickered through my mind as I watched him glance down at the screen for the third time in ten minutes, his fingers tapping against the white tablecloth. The soft lighting at Rosewood Inn cast warm shadows across his face, but something felt different tonight. Off.
""Are you expecting an important call?"" I asked, keeping my tone light as I cut another piece of the herb-crusted salmon. The baby chose that moment to stretch against my ribs, and I pressed a gentle hand to the spot. Seven months along, and our daughter seemed to have inherited her father's restless energy.
""No, sorry."" Jack's smile was quick, apologetic. He set the phone face down beside his plate. ""Just work stuff. You know how it is.""
I did know. Henderson Construction had been busier than ever this spring, with three major projects running simultaneously. But Jack had never brought work stress to our anniversary dinner before. He'd always been so careful about keeping our special occasions sacred.
The servers moved quietly between tables, and I caught sight of Mrs. Finlayson from the grocery store giving us a warm wave from across the dining room. Everyone in Willowbrook knew about our anniversary. Three years married, and still the talk of the town because Jack Henderson had convinced the ""city girl"" to stay.
Not that I'd ever wanted to leave.
""The salmon is perfect,"" I said, trying to recapture the easy intimacy we'd started the evening with. ""Remember our first date here? You were so nervous you knocked over your water glass.""
Jack's laugh was genuine this time, and for a moment he looked like himself again. ""I was terrified you'd realize what a small-town disaster I was and run back to whatever design firm would hire you.""
""Good thing I'm not that smart."" I reached across the table to squeeze his hand. ""Besides, someone had to stay and keep an eye on you and your construction projects.""
The phone buzzed against the table.
Jack's entire posture changed. His shoulders tensed, and that distracted look crept back into his eyes as he glanced at the screen. I felt something cold settle in my stomach.
""Jack?""
""It's nothing. Just..."" He looked up at me, and I saw something I'd never seen before. Conflict. Like he was fighting with himself. ""Harper, I—""
The phone buzzed again. Then again.
This time, he picked it up, and I watched his face pale as he read whatever message had come through. His hand tightened around the device, knuckles going white.
""What is it?"" I asked, but I wasn't sure I wanted to know the answer. The baby kicked again, harder this time, as if she could sense the tension radiating from her father.
""I..."" Jack's voice sounded hollow. ""I have to go.""
The words hit me like a physical blow. ""Go? Jack, it's our anniversary. We haven't even had dessert yet.""
""I know. I know, and I'm sorry, but this is..."" He was already reaching for his wallet, pulling out bills with shaking hands. ""It's an emergency.""
""What kind of emergency?"" I kept my voice steady, but panic was building in my chest. ""Is it your parents? Sam? What's happened?""
Jack's eyes met mine, and I saw something that made my breath catch. Guilt. Deep, crushing guilt mixed with something else.
""It's Madison.""
""Madison?"" I searched his face, trying to understand why that name would cause such distress. ""Your friend from high school?""
He nodded.
""She's... she's sick, Harper. Really sick. Cancer."" The words tumbled out of him in a rush. ""She doesn't have anyone else. No family nearby, no support system. She's scared and alone, and she reached out because she needs help.""
My heart clenched at the pain in his voice. ""Oh, Jack. That's terrible.""
""She's at the hospital in the city right now, and the doctors... they told her she may not have long to live."" His hands were shaking slightly. ""I know the timing is awful, but I can't just leave her to face this alone.""
I felt a stab of disappointment that our anniversary was being cut short, but looking at Jack's anguished face, I couldn't be selfish. This was someone he cared about, someone who was scared and sick and reaching out for help.
""Of course, you have to go,"" I said, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand. ""She needs you right now.""
""Harper, I'm so sorry. I know this is our night, our last anniversary before the baby comes, and I hate that I'm ruining it.""
""You're not ruining anything,"" I said, even though part of me wanted to cry. ""You're being a good friend. Madison must be terrified. I can't imagine facing something like that alone.""
Relief flooded his face, followed immediately by a fresh wave of guilt. ""I don't deserve you. I really don't. Most wives would be furious.""
""I'm disappointed,"" I admitted. ""But I'm not furious. This is who you are, Jack. You help people when they need it. It's one of the reasons I fell in love with you.""
He stood, already reaching for his jacket. ""I'll make this up to you, I promise. We'll have another anniversary dinner. A better one. I'll take you to that place in the city you've been wanting to try.""
""Just focus on helping Madison right now,"" I said. ""We can celebrate later. How long will you be gone?"" I asked.
""I don't know. Maybe overnight. Maybe longer. It depends on..."" He gestured helplessly. ""On how bad it is.""
I tried not to let the disappointment show on my face. Our last child-free anniversary, and he'd be spending it at a hospital with someone else. But Madison was sick and scared, and Jack was probably the only familiar face she had.
""I can get myself home,"" I said. ""Don't worry about me.""
""Are you sure? I could call Sam to come get you—""
""Jack, I'm seven months pregnant, not helpless. I can get myself home."" I managed a small smile. ""Just go. She needs you more than I do right now.""
He was already leaving.
""Jack?"" I called after him.
He paused, turning back with worry in his eyes.
""Drive carefully. Text me when you get there so I know you're safe.""
He nodded, his expression softening with gratitude. ""Stay and have dessert, okay? Don't let this ruin the whole evening. Order that chocolate torte you've been eyeing all night.""
I managed a genuine smile. ""Done.""
He leaned down to peck my forehead, his lips warm and familiar. ""I love you, Harper. More than you know.""
""I love you, too. Now go help Madison.""
After he left, I did exactly what he'd suggested. I ordered the chocolate torte and savored every bite, thinking about how lucky Madison was to have a friend like Jack in her life. Someone who would drop everything to be there when she needed him most.
Mrs. Finlayson stopped by my table shortly after Jack left. ""Everything alright, dear?""
""Jack had to help a friend with an emergency,"" I explained, patting my belly as the baby gave a gentle kick. ""But everything's fine. He'll be back as soon as he can.""
She nodded approvingly. ""That's our Jack. Always there when people need him. You're a lucky woman, Harper.""
""I know,"" I said, meaning it completely.
I finished my dessert slowly, enjoying the peaceful atmosphere of the restaurant. Other couples chatted around me, but I didn't feel out of place. I felt content, proud of my husband for being the kind of man who would rush to help a friend in need, even if it was on our anniversary.
I was fumbling for my phone, my thumb hovering over the number for a taxi, when a hand covered mine. It was Mrs. Finlayson again. ""Nonsense, dear,"" she whispered, guiding me out the door where her husband, George, was already waiting. The drive home was a blur of quiet sympathy from George at the wheel and his wife's soft assurances from the passenger seat.
He took the scenic route past the lake, and despite everything, my eyes were drawn to the shore where Jack had proposed just over three years ago. How he'd been so nervous, so worried I'd say no. As if I could have said anything but yes to the man who'd turned my world upside down in the best possible way.
Our house was dark as we pulled into the driveway. Mrs. Finlayson insisted on seeing me to the door, her presence a comforting, if slightly suffocating, blanket. Once the door clicked shut behind me, I walked through the rooms Jack had helped me decorate, touching the furniture we'd chosen together, the artwork we'd collected. Everything was ready for our daughter's arrival.
In the nursery, I stood beside the crib and rubbed my belly, feeling the baby's movements. ""Daddy's helping someone tonight,"" I whispered. ""Someone who's scared and needs a friend. That's just who he is, little one. Kind and generous and always willing to help.""
I changed into my pajamas and climbed into our bed, pulling Jack's pillow close and breathing in his familiar scent. The baby was active tonight, rolling and stretching.
""He'll be back as soon as he can,"" I said softly.
My phone buzzed with a text from Jack: Made it safely. Madison's stable for now. Thank you for understanding. I love you.
I smiled as I typed back: Give her my love. Take care of yourself, too. I love you.
As I settled in for the night, I felt nothing but gratitude for the man I'd married. Yes, our anniversary had been cut short, but that was life. Sometimes emergencies happened, and you had to be there for the people you cared about.
That was just the kind of man Jack was, and it was one of the many reasons I loved him.
Outside, Willowbrook slept peacefully, and I drifted off thinking about how lucky I was to have a husband who would always do the right thing, even when it was difficult.
I fell asleep with a smile on my face, secure in the knowledge that Jack would be home as soon as Madison was okay.
After all, that's what good people did. They helped others when they could, and they came home to the ones they loved.

The speedometer hit ninety as Madison's text flashed again: Please hurry, I'm so scared.
I eased off the gas, forcing myself to slow down. The last thing Madison needed was for me to wrap my truck around a tree on the way to help her. But every fiber of my being was screaming at me to go faster, to get there before...
Before what? Before she slipped away? Before the cancer took her? Before I lost another person I cared about?
My hands tightened on the steering wheel as another text came through. I glanced at it quickly, swerving slightly as I read: The pain is getting worse. I don't know if I can do this alone.
You're not alone, I text back. I'm coming.
The highway stretched out ahead of me, dark and empty except for the occasional set of headlights. Two and a half hours to the city hospital. Two and a half hours while Madison lay in some sterile room, scared and hurting and probably wondering if anyone in the world still cared about her.
I couldn't let that happen. Not to Madison.
The memories hit me in waves as I drove. Madison at sixteen, crying on my shoulder because her parents were fighting again. Madison at seventeen, fierce and beautiful and so determined to make something of herself. Madison at eighteen, pecking me goodbye with tears in her eyes as she left for college, promising we'd figure it out long-distance.
We hadn't figured it out. She'd found bigger dreams, better opportunities, a wider world than anything Willowbrook could offer. And I'd let her go because I'd known, even then, that trying to hold her back would have destroyed us both.
But I'd never stopped caring about her. Never stopped feeling responsible for the girl who'd trusted me with her secrets, who'd clung to me during her darkest moments. The girl who'd been there for me when Dad had his heart attack, driving twelve hours straight from her college to sit with me in the hospital waiting room.
How could I not be there for her now?
My phone buzzed again. This time it was Harper, and guilt twisted in my stomach as I read her message: Drive safely. Text me when you get there.
Sweet, understanding Harper. God, I didn't deserve her. Any other woman would have thrown a fit about me leaving our anniversary dinner, would have demanded I stay and let Madison find someone else to help her with her crisis. But Harper... Harper had looked at me with those warm hazel eyes and told me to go help my friend.
My friend. That's what I'd called Madison. Just a friend from high school who needed help.
But even as I told myself that, I knew it wasn't entirely true. Madison wasn't just a friend. She was my first love, my first heartbreak, my first lesson in what it meant to care about someone more than yourself. She was the ghost that had haunted the edges of my relationship with Harper, the shadow I'd never quite been able to shake.
And now she was dying.
The thought hit me like a physical blow. Madison, with her fierce green eyes and her dreams of conquering the world, now reduced to a hospital bed and a cancer diagnosis. It wasn't right. It wasn't fair.
Another text: I keep thinking about high school. Do you remember that night we snuck out to the lake? You said you'd always protect me.
I did remember. Madison had been upset about her parents' latest fight, and I'd climbed through her bedroom window to take her somewhere quiet, somewhere safe. We'd sat on the dock by the lake, her head on my shoulder, and I'd promised her that no matter what happened, I'd always be there for her.
I'd always protect her.
The promise felt as real now as it had then. Maybe more real, because now I understood what it meant to lose someone. What it meant to have regrets you couldn't undo.
I wasn't going to let Madison face this alone. I couldn't.
The city lights appeared on the horizon, and I pushed the truck a little faster. Almost there. Almost to Madison, who was scared and hurting and waiting for me to keep a promise I'd made a lifetime ago.
The hospital parking garage was nearly empty at this hour. I found a spot close to the elevators and sat in the truck for a moment, trying to gather myself. My hands were shaking slightly, and I felt like I might throw up. When was the last time I'd been this scared?
When Dad had his heart attack. When I thought I might lose him.
But Dad had pulled through. Dad was fine now, retired and happy in Florida with Mom. Madison might not be so lucky.
I pulled out my phone and texted Harper: Made it safely. Going in now.
She responded immediately: Give her my love. Take care of yourself, too. I love you.
God, I really didn't deserve her.
The elevator ride to the oncology floor felt like an eternity. I'd looked up the unit online during the drive, memorizing the directions so I wouldn't waste time getting lost. Room 314. That's where Madison was waiting.
The hallway was quiet except for the soft beeping of machines and the distant murmur of the nursing station. I found room 314 and hesitated outside the door, suddenly unsure. What if she was sleeping? What if she was worse than I'd imagined? What if...
""Jack?""
The voice was so soft I almost missed it. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, and my heart nearly stopped.
Madison was sitting up in the hospital bed, looking smaller and more fragile than I'd ever seen her. Her platinum blonde hair was pulled back in a messy bun, and her face was pale, almost translucent. She was wearing a hospital gown that made her look vulnerable and young, like the girl I'd known in high school.
But it was her eyes that got me. Those green eyes I remembered so well, now filled with fear and pain and something that looked almost like... relief?
""You came,"" she whispered, and I could hear tears in her voice.
""Of course I came."" I moved to the chair beside her bed, my voice rough with emotion. ""Did you really think I wouldn't?""
She reached for my hand, and I let her take it. Her fingers were cold, and I could feel them trembling.
""I was so scared you'd think I was being dramatic. It's been so long since we talked, and I know you have your own life now, your wife and the baby coming..."" She looked down at our joined hands. ""I didn't have anyone else to call, Jack. I'm so sorry.""
""Don't apologize. Never apologize for needing help."" I squeezed her hand gently. ""Tell me what's happening. What did the doctors say?""
Madison's eyes filled with tears. ""Br-east cancer. Stage two. They found it during a routine exam a few weeks ago, and it's... it's aggressive. They want to start treatment immediately, but the side effects..."" She shuddered. ""I'm so scared, Jackie. I don't know if I'm strong enough to fight this.""
The old nickname hit me like a punch to the chest. No one had called me Jackie in years. Not since high school. Not since Madison.
""Hey."" I reached up to wipe a tear from her cheek. ""You're the strongest person I know. Remember when you stood up to Brad Morrison when he was bullying that kid in our chemistry class? You were half his size, but you didn't back down.""
A small smile flickered across her face. ""I'd forgotten about that.""
""I haven't forgotten anything about you."" The words slipped out before I could stop them, and I saw something shift in her expression. Something hopeful and vulnerable that made my chest tighten.
""Jackie..."" she whispered.
""What do you need from me?"" I asked, steering the conversation back to safer ground. ""What can I do to help?""
""Just... stay with me tonight? I know it's a lot to ask, especially on your anniversary, but I can't bear the thought of being alone right now. The chemo starts tomorrow, and after that..."" She trailed off, shaking her head. ""I just need to know someone cares. That someone remembers who I used to be before all this.""
I thought about Harper, probably asleep in our bed by now, probably wondering when I'd be home. I thought about the anniversary dinner we'd never finished, the celebration we'd never had.
But I looked at Madison, small and scared and so different from the confident girl who'd left Willowbrook all those years ago, and I knew I couldn't leave her. Not tonight.
""I'll stay,"" I said. ""For as long as you need me.""
The relief on her face was immediate and overwhelming. ""Thank you,"" she breathed. ""I don't know how I'll ever repay you.""
""You don't need to repay me. That's what friends do.""
Friends. The word felt inadequate, but it was all I could offer.
Madison shifted in the bed, wincing slightly. ""They have a recliner that pulls out. The nurses said family members use it sometimes.""
I helped her get comfortable, adjusting her pillows and making sure she had water within reach. The simple acts of care felt natural, necessary. This was what I was good at – taking care of people, solving problems, being the person others could count on.
""Jackie?"" Madison's voice was drowsy now, the pain medication clearly taking effect.
""Yeah?""
""I'm sorry about your anniversary. Harper must hate me.""
I thought about Harper's reaction at the restaurant, her immediate concern for Madison's wellbeing, her insistence that I do whatever I could to help. ""She doesn't hate you. She's worried about you.""
""She sounds like an angel.""
""She is.""
Madison was quiet for a long moment, and I thought she might be falling asleep. Then she spoke again, so softly I almost didn't hear her.
""I used to dream about you coming back for me. Isn't that silly?""
I didn't know what to say to that, so I said nothing. But I didn't let go of her hand.
My phone buzzed with a text from Harper: How is she? How are you?
I looked at Madison, now sleeping peacefully for the first time in who knew how long, and typed back: She's resting. It's bad, but she's strong. Staying the night.
Harper's response came quickly: I'm glad you're there for her. Get some rest. I love you.
I love you too, I typed back. And I meant it. I loved Harper completely, deeply, in a way I'd never loved anyone before.
But sitting there in the dark hospital room, holding Madison's hand and listening to her breathe, I felt something I hadn't felt in years. A connection to my past, to the boy I'd been before life got complicated. A responsibility to the girl who'd trusted me with her secrets and her fears.
I settled back in the uncomfortable recliner and closed my eyes, telling myself I was just being a good friend. Just helping someone who needed help. Just keeping a promise I'd made a long time ago.
But deep down, in a place I didn't want to examine too closely, I knew it was more complicated than that. It had always been more complicated with Madison.
Outside the window, the city lights twinkled like distant stars, and somewhere far away, my pregnant wife was sleeping alone in our bed on what should have been our anniversary night.
I pushed the guilt aside and focused on the woman beside me, the woman who'd once been my whole world and who was now facing the fight of her life.
""I'm here,"" I whispered to her. ""I'm here, and I'm not going anywhere."" It was a promise I'd made before. A promise I'd kept then, and would keep now, no matter what the cost.

The coffee was cold when Jack finally came home.
I'd been up since six, moving around the kitchen with the familiar weight of pregnancy slowing my steps, making breakfast for two even though I wasn't sure when the second person would arrive. The baby had been active all night, as if she could sense her father's absence, and I'd spent the dark hours with my hand on my belly, whispering reassurances.
He's helping someone. He'll be back soon.
When Jack walked through the door at nearly nine o'clock, still wearing yesterday's clothes and looking like he'd barely slept, I felt as exhausted as he looked.
""Hey,"" he said, his voice rough and tired. ""Sorry I'm so late. I meant to be back before you woke up.""
""It's fine,"" I said, though it wasn't. I'd been imagining all sorts of scenarios – Madison taking a turn for the worse, Jack sleeping fitfully in an uncomfortable hospital chair, Jack driving back from the city hospital in the middle of the night completely exhausted. ""How is she?""
Jack slumped into his usual chair at the kitchen table, running his hands through his hair. ""She's scheduled to start treatment next week. But Harper..."" He looked up at me with exhausted eyes. ""She's terrified. She doesn't have anyone else.""
I poured him a cup of coffee, noting how his hands shook slightly when he reached for it. ""I'm glad you were there for her. She must be so scared.""
""She is."" Jack's voice was distant, and I noticed he was staring out the window instead of looking at me. ""I couldn't have left her alone. Not like that.""
The baby kicked, a sharp jab against my ribs that made me wince. Jack usually noticed when that happened, usually reached over to feel the movement with his own hand. This time, he didn't seem to see it at all.
""Are you okay?"" I asked, settling into the chair across from him. ""You look exhausted.""
""Just tired. That hospital chair wasn't exactly comfortable."" He managed a weak smile. ""I'll be fine after a shower and some real food.""
I watched him drink his coffee, noticing the way his shoulders remained tense, the way he kept glancing at his phone. There was something different about him, something distant that I couldn't quite name.
""Will you need to go back today?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice casual.
""Probably. Madison's starting chemo soon, and she'll need someone to drive her to appointments. Her car's still in LA, and she can't afford to rent one long-term.""
""Of course."" I nodded, ignoring the small twist in my stomach. ""When does treatment start?""
""Tuesday. And then it'll be twice a week for the next few months, assuming..."" He trailed off, shaking his head. ""Assuming everything goes well.""
Twice a week. That meant Jack would be gone for most of two days every week, driving back and forth to the city, sitting with Madison through her treatments. I calculated quickly in my head – that would take him away for hours at a time, maybe even overnight stays if the treatments ran long.
""That's a lot of driving,"" I said carefully.
""It's what she needs."" Jack's voice had an edge to it, a defensiveness I'd never heard before. ""What else am I supposed to do? Let her go through this alone?""
""I'm not saying that. I just meant... it's a big commitment.""
""She's going through cancer, Harper. I think I can handle some inconvenience.""
The word stung. Inconvenience. As if my concern was about something trivial, as if I was being selfish for worrying about how this would affect our life, our pregnancy, our preparation for the baby.
""I know,"" I said quietly. ""I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound unsupportive.""
Jack's expression softened immediately. ""No, I'm sorry. I'm just tired and worried about her. I don't mean to snap at you.""
He reached across the table to take my hand, and I felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. This was my Jack, the man who apologized when he was wrong, who recognized when stress made him short-tempered.
""Why don't you go shower and get some rest?"" I suggested. ""I can work on the Morrison project from home today.""
""You sure? I know you wanted to meet with them this week.""
""It's fine. I can handle it.""
Jack squeezed my hand gratefully. ""What did I do to deserve you?""
Everything, I thought. My husband was the most selfless person I knew, going out of his way to help everyone, from the elderly lady whose roof was collapsing because it was so old to the young couple buying their first home who didn't know the house they were buying was full of rotten wood. Nothing was ever too much for Jack. If he saw someone who needed help, he was there offering what he could. It was part of what drew me to him.
But I didn't say that. Instead, I smiled and said, ""Just lucky, I guess.""
After Jack went upstairs, I sat at the kitchen table with my coffee and tried to shake off the unease that had settled in my chest. Madison was sick. She needed help. Jack was being a good friend, a good person. This was temporary.
While he showered, I started on the Morrison project, spreading my design materials across the kitchen table. It felt good to focus on something creative, something that was mine. I was lucky to have work I could do from home, especially as the pregnancy progressed.
By the time Jack came back downstairs, I was deep in color swatches and layout options. He looked more like himself after his shower, more present, and when he pecked my forehead before leaving for work, it felt completely normal.
""I'll probably need to go back to the hospital tonight,"" he said, grabbing his keys. ""Madison's nervous about the treatment plan, and I promised I'd be there when she talks to the oncologist.""
""Of course,"" I said. ""I'll be here.""
""I know you will."" He smiled, and for a moment, it reached his eyes. ""I love you, Harper.""
""I love you, too.""
But as I watched him drive away, I noticed that his truck turned left at the end of our street instead of right. Left led to the highway, to the city, to Madison. Right led to Henderson Construction, to his job, to his responsibilities here in Willowbrook.
I told myself it didn't mean anything. He probably had errands to run, supplies to pick up, meetings to attend. But the unease in my chest grew a little stronger.
Two hours later, I was at Brew & Bean, picking up my usual herbal tea and a muffin, when I first heard the whispers.
""...left her sitting alone at Rosewood Inn...""
""...on their anniversary, can you believe it?""
""...that woman who came back to town. Madison something...""
I recognized the voices – three women from various community events, all leaning in close with the eager expressions of people sharing gossip. I didn't mean to eavesdrop, but their table was right behind me at the counter.
""Well, I always wondered if he was really over her,"" one of them said. ""First love and all that.""
""Poor Harper,"" another added. ""Seven months pregnant and her husband's running off to be with his ex-girlfriend.""
""Ex-girlfriend?"" The third voice sounded scandalized.
""Oh, honey, they dated all through high school. Everyone knew Jack was head over heels for her. We all thought they'd get married. Then she left and never came back. Jack was devastated.""
Ex-girlfriend? Get married? Jack was devastated? I felt a flutter of surprise. Jack had said Madison was a friend from high school. He hadn't mentioned they'd dated. Or that he'd planned to marry her.",2,1754981677.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I've had my Nespresso for a number of years now with no problems at all. Last week I ran a cleaning cycle and since then I seem to have problems.
The main problem I have now is that when there is a capsule added, my cup is around half full when it's finished extracting with the rest of the water being sent to the water tray instead,it was never a problem before other than a little water in water tray.
I've ran a lungo cup with a capsule but without the trays and can see clear water running down the spout into the water tray whilst the coffee coming out is more like a drip with occasional spurt of water.
Any ideas what I should do next, has something broken during the cleaning cycle?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or support

The Unseen Cost of Love
For ten years, I gave up everything for my boyfriend, Damien. After a family scandal left him ostracized and broken, I worked two jobs to send him to a prestigious university, believing in the genius everyone else had abandoned.

But the moment he became the tech innovator I always knew he could be, he fell for someone else--a wealthy, brilliant colleague named Carson Wall.

Suddenly, I was an embarrassment. His new friends whispered about the ""waitress"" dragging him down. He started forgetting me, too. He forgot my birthday. He forgot my favorite food. During a fire alarm at a restaurant, he ran right past me to save her, leaving me to fall in the panicked crowd.

I was the one who pulled him off a rooftop when he wanted to die. I sacrificed my own dreams so he could have his. I thought he loved me, but I was just a debt he felt obligated to repay.

After he left me in that fire, I finally gave up. I booked a one-way ticket home, ready to disappear from his life.

Then, I received a video from Carson--her tearful love confession to him.

I took a deep breath, sent him one last message telling him we were over, and blocked his number forever.


Chapter 1
""You're really coming back?"" Maya's voice crackled over the phone, full of disbelief.

I watched the city lights blur through the cheap glass of my apartment window. Rain slid down the pane, making the neon signs bl**d into long, sad streaks.

""Yeah. I'm coming home.""

""Just like that? After ten years? You're giving up on everything you built there?""

Her questions hung in the air. I knew what she was really asking. She was asking about him.

""There's nothing here for me anymore,"" I said, my voice flat. I traced a raindrop with my finger, watching it join another and slide away.

""Is Damien coming with you?"" Maya finally asked the question we were both avoiding.

A hollow space opened in my ch**t. The name felt heavy, a stone I'd been carrying for a decade. I didn't answer right away. The silence stretched, filled only by the hum of the old refrigerator.

""No,"" I said, my voice barely a wh**per. ""I'm leaving alone.""

Just then, my phone buzzed with a text. It was from a number I didn't recognize, but the message was clear.

A single, pristine photo of a train ticket. My ticket. For tomorrow morning.

Below it, a short sentence: ""He won't be held back by you anymore. This is for the best.""

It was from her. Carson Wall.

I typed back a simple reply, my thumb steady despite the tremor in my heart.

""I know.""

Then I deleted the conversation and blocked the number.

The name Damien echoed in my mind. It was a name that once meant the world to me.

I remembered the first time I saw him. He was on stage, accepting a university award for a coding competition he'd won. He was brilliant, the golden boy of our state school, his future as bright as the stage lights that shone on him. Everyone knew his name.

I was just Blanche Forbes, a girl from a forgotten Rust Belt town, sitting in the back of the auditorium. I felt plain, invisible. I worked two jobs to pay my tuition and barely had time to study. He was a star, and I was just a shadow in the crowd.

Then his world fell apart.

A family scandal erupted. His father, a local businessman, was arrested for fraud. Suddenly, the golden boy was the son of a criminal. The whispers followed him everywhere. Old family secrets, sealed juvenile records, everything was dragged into the light by the local news.

People who once admired him now pointed and sneered. He was ostracized, humiliated.

One night, during a campus party, I saw him slip away. A gut feeling made me follow. I found him on the roof of the tallest building on campus, standing on the ledge. The wind tore at his clothes, and he looked so broken, so small against the vast, dark sky.

He was going to jump.

I didn't think. I just ran. I grabbed his arm, my fingers digging into his jacket. I pulled with all my strength, my own fear making me strong. We stumbled backward, collapsing onto the gritty rooftop together.

He looked at me, his eyes empty. ""Why did you stop me?""

I didn't have an answer. I couldn't explain why the thought of him being gone felt like a tear in the fabric of the world. So I just held onto his arm, my knuckles white, and refused to let go.

We stayed there for hours, not speaking, just two broken people in the cold night air.

That was the beginning. He dropped out of school, unable to face the shame. I found him a small, cheap apartment away from campus. And then I made a decision. I dropped out too.

I gave up my own future.

I worked as a waitress, a barista, a cleaner. I took any shift I could get, my hands raw, my body aching. I saved every penny to send him back to school, not to our state university, but to a prestigious one on the coast, a place where no one knew his name, where he could start over.

He asked me once, his eyes full of a mixture of guilt and confusion, ""Blanche, why are you doing this?""

I was exhausted, smelling of stale coffee and disinfectant, but I forced a smile. ""Because you're a genius, Damien. The world needs to see it. I'm just... not.""

He looked at me then, his expression serious. ""I'll pay you back. I swear. One day, I'll give you everything.""

And he did. He graduated with top honors. He was recruited by a major tech firm. He became the Damien Rowe everyone had once expected him to be-a rising star, an innovator.

We moved into a beautiful high-rise apartment, the kind I used to clean. The city lights that once seemed so distant were now our nightly view.

I thought the hard part was over. I thought we had finally made it.

But I was wrong. The worst was yet to come.

It started subtly. I was using his laptop to look up a recipe one evening when a message popped up. It was from someone named Carson.

The photo showed a woman with a bright, confident smile and eyes that sparkled with intelligence. She was beautiful, sophisticated, the kind of woman who belonged in his new world.

The messages were frequent, full of inside jokes about work, discussions about complex algorithms I didn't understand, and plans for coffee or lunch.

His replies were short, almost dismissive. ""Busy."" ""No time."" ""Later.""

I felt a small, foolish flicker of relief.

Then, one night, he came home looking troubled. He paced the living room, running a hand through his hair.

""Blanche,"" he said, stopping in front of me. ""How do you... get a girl to like you?""

The question hit me like a physical blow. The air left my lungs.

""What kind of girl?"" I asked, my voice tight.

""Someone... sophisticated. Smart. From a different world.""

Carson.

My heart shattered. All these years, I had been his savior, his supporter, his rock. I had cooked for him, cleaned for him, held him when the nightmares of his past came back. I thought he loved me.

But I was a fool. He was grateful. He felt indebted. But he didn't love me.

I had never told him how I felt. I was always the strong one, the practical one. I thought my actions spoke for themselves. I thought he understood that everything I did, I did out of love.

Now I knew. He saw me as a debt to be repaid, not a woman to be loved.

The next day, Carson Wall found me at the coffee shop where I still worked part-time. She sat across from me, her expensive perfume filling the air. She didn't waste time.

She slid a file across the table. It was Damien's sealed juvenile record. The one thing that could still destroy his career if it got out.

""His cousin, Demetrius, is threatening to release this,"" she said calmly. ""Damien is on the verge of a huge promotion. This would ruin him.""

My bl**d ran cold.

""But don't worry,"" she continued, her smile sharp. ""My father is on the board. I can make this problem disappear. I can protect him.""

She paused, her eyes meeting mine.

""You can't. You're holding him back, Blanche. Look at you. Look at him. You live in two different worlds. He feels obligated to you, and it's crippling him. If you really love him, you'll let him go.""

Every word was a carefully aimed dart, and they all hit their mark.

That night, I stayed up all night, her words replaying in my head. I looked at my rough hands, my simple clothes. I thought about the conversations he had with her, the world of ideas and ambition I couldn't share.

She was right. I couldn't protect him. He didn't love me.

Leaving was the only kind thing I could do. It was the last sacrifice I could make for him.

I would set him free. I would be free. Free from the hope that one day he would see me. Free from the pain of knowing he never would.

A sharp pain shot through my stomach, doubling me over. I gasped, clutching my abdomen. It was my old stomach problem, a gift from years of cheap food and stress.

I fumbled for my pills, but my hands were shaking too badly. The bottle slipped, scattering the small white tablets across the floor.

Just then, the front door opened. Damien was home.

He saw me on the floor, surrounded by pills, and rushed to my side.

""Blanche! What's wrong?""

He scooped me up and carried me to the sofa with an ease born of long practice. He knew exactly where the hot water bottle was, where I kept the emergency medication.

He pressed a warm mug into my hands, his touch gentle. ""Thank you,"" I whispered, my voice hoarse.

""You need to take better care of yourself,"" he said, his brow furrowed with a familiar, distant worry. He was concerned, but it was the concern one has for a responsibility.

In the early days, when my stomach first started acting up, he would hold me for hours, whispering apologies, blaming himself for the stress that caused it. Now, his care felt like a routine, a checklist item.

He reached out to brush a strand of hair from my face, a gesture that once would have made my heart leap.

I flinched and turned my head away.

He froze, his hand hovering in the air. ""Blanche?""

The confusion in his eyes was genuine. He had no idea.

""Damien, I..."" I started to say it. I need to leave.

But his phone rang, shattering the moment.

He glanced at the caller ID. Carson. His expression softened.

He answered, his eyes still on me, but his attention was already gone. ""Carson? What's wrong? ... Okay, okay, I'm on my way. Don't worry.""

He hung up and stood up, already grabbing his keys. ""Carson's in some trouble. I have to go.""

He was out the door before I could say a word.

The click of the lock echoed in the silent apartment. It was the sound of my last hope dying.

I didn't try to say goodbye. He had already left.

I sat alone in the dark, the pain in my stomach a dull ache compared to the one in my heart. I walked to the refrigerator. Inside was a small, plain cheesecake I had bought.

Today was my birthday.

He had forgotten. He always forgot.

Every year, I would buy myself a small cake and make a silent wish. For ten years, the wish was always the same.

I wish for Damien's happiness.

I lit a single candle and watched the small flame dance. In its flickering light, I saw him again, the boy on the roof, lost and broken.

I had caught a falling star. But stars don't belong on the ground. They are meant to burn brightly in the sky, far away.


Chapter 2
The next morning, I went to my shift at the coffee shop as if nothing had happened. The familiar scent of roasted beans and steamed milk was a strange comfort.

I had kept this job, even after Damien made it big. He'd asked me to quit a dozen times.

""You don't need to do this anymore, Blanche. I can take care of you.""

But I always refused. This coffee shop was near the university where we first met. It was the last piece of my old life, the life before him, and I couldn't let it go. It was also a tether, a reminder of where he came from, a place I foolishly thought he might need to return to one day.

I had planned to give my two weeks'notice today. My manager, a kind older woman named Mrs. Gable, was sad to hear it.

""Are you sure, dear? We'll miss you. You're the best barista I've ever had.""

Her kindness made my throat tighten. ""I have to move back home,"" I said, the lie tasting like ash.

""Well, could you do me one last favor? We have a big catering order for a tech conference downtown. My other girl called in sick. I'll pay you double.""

I agreed. I could use the money.

The conference was in a sleek, modern building with glass walls and cold steel accents. It was Damien's world. As I set up the coffee urns and pastry trays in a side lounge, I saw it.

On a digital display board cycling through photos of the event's speakers, there was a picture of Damien and Carson.

They were standing side by side, smiling. He looked relaxed, happy. A genuine smile, not the tired, strained one he gave me anymore. Carson was radiant, her hand resting lightly on his arm, a gesture both casual and proprietary. They looked like they belonged together.

""They make a great couple, don't they?""

I turned to see two women in business suits looking at the same picture.

""He's Damien Rowe, the genius from Apex Innovations. And she's Carson Wall. Her father is a tech mogul, a big investor in his company.""

My hand trembled as I poured coffee. I kept my head down, hoping they wouldn't notice me.

""Is he really with her?"" I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.

""Oh, totally,"" the first woman said, not even looking at me. ""He's obsessed with her. He never used to come to these networking events, but now he shows up to everything she's at. He even redesigned his entire lab's interface based on a suggestion she made.""

""I heard he even buys her coffee every morning, the expensive kind from that little artisan place,"" the other added. ""God, what I wouldn't give for a guy like that.""

A sharp pain, colder and more intense than my chronic stomach ache, seized me. He buys her coffee every morning. He remembered her coffee order but always forgot my birthday.

""What about the woman he lives with?"" another colleague joined them. ""The one from his hometown?""

The first woman scoffed. ""Oh, her? She's just some leech. I heard she works as a waitress or something. Can you imagine? Damien Rowe, a man on the cover of tech magazines, with a waitress? It's embarrassing.""

""Someone should tell him to just pay her off and get rid of her. She's dragging him down.""

The words were like stones, pelting me, bruising me. I felt my face flush with shame.

I wanted to scream that I wasn't a leech. I was the one who lifted him up. But what was the point? In their world, I was nothing.

""Are you okay, miss?"" one of the women asked, finally noticing my pale face.

I forced a smile. ""Yes. I think you're right. They do make a perfect couple.""

I finished my work in a daze, my hands moving on autopilot. I packed up the empty containers and wheeled the cart out, desperate to escape.

I hurried through the lobby, my head down, wanting only to disappear into the anonymity of the city streets.

Then I froze.

Through the revolving glass doors, I saw them. Damien and Carson, standing on the sidewalk.

She was laughing at something he said, her head tilted back. She reached up and adjusted the knot of his tie, her fingers lingering on his ch**t for a moment too long. He didn't pull away. He just watched her, a soft smile on his face.

""The resonance frequency of the quantum processor is unstable,"" he was saying, his voice animated in a way I hadn't heard in years. ""But if we reroute the cooling system through a tertiary manifold...""

Carson nodded, her eyes bright with understanding. ""You could create a stable quantum state without sacrificing processing speed. Brilliant.""

They were talking about his work, his passion. They were speaking a language I would never understand.

The gap between us had never felt so vast, so insurmountable. It wasn't just about money or status. It was about connection, about minds meeting. He had found his equal.

And I was just a ghost from a past he was desperate to forget.

I turned and fled, not looking back.

When I got back to the apartment, he was already there. He was standing in the living room, surrounded by moving boxes.

He had found the cake box in the tr**h. The single, burnt-out candle was still there.

""It was your birthday yesterday,"" he said, his voice quiet. He looked guilty.

I just nodded, my throat too tight to speak.

""I'm sorry, Blanche. I... I forgot. There was a crisis at work.""

""It's fine,"" I said.

""I'll make it up to you,"" he promised, the same empty promise he always made. ""We'll go out to a nice dinner next week.""

""Don't worry about it, Damien. You should focus on your work. It's more important."" I was already letting him go. I was making it easy for him.

He seemed relieved. ""Okay. If you're sure.""

He looked at me, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. ""What did you wish for?""

I wanted to say, 'I wished you loved me.'

But before I could answer, his phone rang. It was Carson. She'd had a flat tire on the way home from the conference.

""I'll be right there,"" he said, grabbing his keys. He was gone in a flash, leaving me alone with my un-wished wish and a house full of boxes.

I ate the leftover cheesecake for dinner. It was cold and sweet, but all I could taste was bitterness.


Chapter 3
Damien didn't come home for three days.

I knew where he was. Carson's Instagram was a curated diary of their time together. A picture of her car with a flat tire, Damien kneeling to fix it, captioned ""My hero."" A photo of them sharing a ridiculously expensive dessert, his arm draped casually over the back of her chair. A selfie of them in what looked like her apartment, his face softer and more unguarded than I had seen it in years.

I spent those three days packing. It didn't take long. My life fit into two suitcases. All my possessions were practical, worn. There were no luxuries, no indulgences. Just the simple necessities of a life lived for someone else.

Tucked in a corner of my drawer was a small, velvet box. Inside was a cheap silver locket, a gift from Damien from our first year together. It was the only gift he'd ever bought me with his own money, earned from a tutoring gig. I had cherished it. Now, it just felt like another ghost.

He finally came home on the fourth day, looking tired but content.

He saw my suitcases by the door. ""Going somewhere?""

""Just sorting through some old things,"" I lied, unable to meet his eyes. I couldn't bear for him to see the pain in them.

He nodded, accepting the explanation without question. He was too wrapped up in his own world to notice mine was collapsing.

""I'm moving,"" he announced, a strange excitement in his voice. ""The company is giving me a new place, closer to the main campus. A penthouse.""

He described the floor-to-ceiling windows, the state-of-the-art kitchen, the view.

""You should come see it,"" he said, an afterthought.

A part of me wanted to scream, to refuse, to throw the locket at him. But another, weaker part of me wanted one last look. A final, definitive end.

""Okay,"" I said quietly.

I told myself it was a farewell tour of the life I was leaving behind.

The new building was impossibly sleek, a monument of glass and chrome in the heart of the city's most expensive district. As we stepped out of the elevator into the penthouse suite, we ran into Carson. She was coming out of the apartment next door.

""Damien! Blanche! What a coincidence,"" she said, her smile bright and welcoming. It didn't reach her eyes. Make one huge, open space.""

The meaning was clear. A shared life. A joined future.

Damien just smiled, looking pleased. ""Carson has great taste.""

I felt a familiar, sharp pain in my stomach, but this time it was different. It was the pain of finality.

It was almost lunchtime. Carson suggested a restaurant nearby, a place with white tablecloths and a w**e list longer than my arm. She handed me the menu, a subtle, cruel gesture. I stared at the French words, feeling my cheeks burn with humiliation. I couldn't pronounce any of it, let alone know what it was.

Damien noticed my distress and took the menu from my hands. ""Blanche doesn't like rich food,"" he said to Carson, as if explaining a child's picky eating habits.
""Oh, of course,"" Carson said, her voice dripping with false sympathy. ""We should get her something simple.""

He turned to me. ""What do you want, Blanche? A salad?""

He knew Carson's coffee order, her taste in furniture, the intricacies of her work. He had spent ten years with me and didn't know my favorite food.

""Anything is fine,"" I mumbled.

My hands felt clumsy and large as I tried to navigate the array of silverware. I knocked over my water glass, the crystal shattering on the marble floor. The noise was deafening. Everyone stared. I saw the pity and contempt in their eyes.

I fled to the restroom, my face burning. I could hear their whispers as I left. ""Who is that woman? She clearly doesn't belong.""

I splashed cold water on my face, staring at my reflection in the ornate mirror. The woman looking back was a stranger. Pale, tired, with sad eyes and clothes that screamed 'out of place'.
This wasn't my world. It never had been.

Suddenly, a fire alarm blared through the restaurant. Panic erupted. People were shouting, running for the exits.

My first and only thought was: Damien.

I ran back to our table, pushing through the panicked crowd. But he was gone.

The table was empty. His chair was pushed back. He had left.

He had left me.

I was swept along with the crowd, stumbling, my ankle twisting painfully. I fell to the ground, the sm**e stinging my eyes.

Through the haze, I saw him. He was outside, a safe distance away. He was holding Carson, who was coughing dramatically into his shoulder. He was looking back at the restaurant, his face a mask of concern.

""Blanche is still in there!"" he said, but he didn't move. He held Carson tighter.

""She's a grown woman, Damien,"" Carson said, her voice muffled against his suit. ""She can take care of herself. My ankle hurts.""

He looked from her to the burning building, his face torn. But it was only for a second. He scooped Carson into his arms and carried her toward a waiting car.

He left me there, on the ground, in the middle of chaos, without a second glance.

I managed to crawl out, my body bruised, my ankle screaming in protest. I watched his car drive away, disappearing into the city traffic.

He had made his choice.

And in that moment, so did I.

 I limped to the nearest hospital, got my ankle wrapped, and then went straight home. I pulled out my phone and booked a one-way train ticket back to my rusty, forgotten hometown.

That night, I dreamt of the past ten years. I saw Damien on the rooftop, young and broken. I saw him in our cramped apartments, studying late into the night. I saw his face on magazine covers. I saw him smile at Carson.

I saw him walk away from a burning building, leaving me behind.

I woke up with a start. He was standing by my bed, a silhouette against the pre-dawn light.

In his hand, he was holding my train ticket.

""You're leaving?"" he asked, his voice a low growl of disbelief and something else. Betrayal.

Chapter 4
""Where did you get that?"" I asked, my heart pounding against my ribs. I sat up, pulling the covers tighter around myself.

""It was on the counter,"" he said, his eyes fixed on the ticket as if it were a foreign object he couldn't comprehend.

""My mom's not feeling well,"" I lied, the words coming easily now. ""I'm going home to see her.""

He looked relieved, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. ""For how long?""

""A week or two.""

He nodded. Of course he wouldn't offer to come with me. He hated my hometown. He hated the memories of his past that lived there. He would never go back.

And I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that once I left this apartment, I would never come back either. We would never see each other again.
He finally looked at me, his gaze dropping to my bandaged ankle. ""What happened to your foot?""

""The fire at the restaurant. I fell.""

""You went back in?"" he asked, a frown creasing his brow. ""Why would you do that?""

""I was looking for you,"" I said simply. ""I was worried.""

His expression froze. He stared at me, and for a second, I saw the boy on the rooftop again, the one who had looked at me with such raw, desperate need.

""You're always doing that,"" he whispered. ""Always running into fires for me.""

I gave a small, bitter laugh. ""Not anymore, Damien.""

He had Carson to protect him now. She was his shield, his partner. I was just a relic from a life he had outgrown. I didn't say it out loud. What was the point?
""You're right,"" I said instead, my voice hollow. ""We both have our own paths to walk now.""

He spent the morning helping me move the last of his things to the new penthouse. I packed my two suitcases separately, setting them by the door.

""Just getting these ready for my trip,"" I said when he looked at them.

He didn't question it.

Soon, our apartment was empty. The rooms echoed with our footsteps. The ghosts of the last ten years seemed to linger in the dust motes dancing in the sunlight. This place had been our sanctuary, the first nice home we ever shared. Now it was just a shell.

I was cleaning out the last of the kitchen cupboards, throwing away old spices and forgotten cans, when I went to take the tr**h out.

The hallway was quiet. As I reached the ga**age chute, a hand clamped over my mouth from behind. Another arm wrapped around my waist, lifting me off my feet.
I struggled, but the grip was like iron. I was dragged into the stairwell, the heavy fire door slamming shut behind us.

The last thing I saw before a sharp blow to the back of my head sent me into darkness was a face that was a cruel, twisted version of Damien's.

I woke up on a cold, damp floor. My hands and feet were tied with zip ties that cut into my skin. The air smelled of mildew and stale beer. I was in some kind of abandoned warehouse.

A man stepped out of the shadows. He had Damien's dark hair and sharp jawline, but his eyes were filled with a sneering, resentful light.

""Look what we have here,"" he said, circling me like a predator. ""Damien's little charity case.""

He crouched down in front of me. ""You must be Blanche. I'm Demetrius. Damien's cousin. The one he likes to pretend doesn't exist.""

""He's not like you,"" I spat, my voice raw.
""Oh, but he is,"" Demetrius sneered. ""He's just better at hiding it."" He lashed out, the back of his hand catching my cheek. The blow sent a starburst of pain through my head. My lip split, and I tasted bl**d.

""Don't you ever defend him to me,"" he snarled.

He grabbed my chin, forcing me to look at him. ""Now, you're going to call my dear cousin. You're going to tell him I have you. You're going to tell him that if he wants you back in one piece, he's going to transfer half of his company shares to me.""

I stared at him, my heart hammering. I wouldn't do it. I would never be a weapon used against Damien.

I shook my head.

Demetrius's face twisted in a rictus of rage. He grabbed my phone from my pocket and dialed Damien's number. He put it on speaker.

It rang. And rang. And rang.

Voicemail.
""He's not answering,"" Demetrius said, his voice dangerously low. He dialed again.

Again, no answer.

""See?"" he taunted, his face close to mine. ""He doesn't care. He's probably off with his new, rich girlfriend. He's already forgotten about you.""

The words were poison, but I refused to let them work. ""He's busy. His work is important.""

Demetrius laughed, a harsh, ugly sound. ""You're still defending him? You st**id bi**h."" He nodded to two thugs who had been lurking in the shadows. ""Teach her a lesson.""

They dragged me to my feet. A fist slammed into my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. Another blow landed on my ribs. Pain exploded through my body. They dropped me to the floor, and a boot connected with my side.

Demetrius picked up my phone again. ""One last try.""

He held the phone to my ear as it rang. I prayed Damien wouldn't answer. I prayed he was safe, happy, oblivious.

But this time, just as it was about to go to voicemail, the call connected.


Chapter 5
""Damien's busy right now. Can I take a message?""

It wasn't his voice. It was hers. Carson.

A wave of cold dread washed over me, more chilling than the pain from my ribs.
Demetrius smirked, his eyes glittering with triumph. ""Well, well, well. Look who answered the phone. Carson Wall. Put my cousin on the line.""

There was a pause on the other end. Then Carson's voice, sharper now, laced with suspicion. ""Who is this?""

""This is the man who has your boyfriend's little pet,"" Demetrius snarled. ""And if he ever wants to see her again, he'll listen to my demands.""

He hung up before she could reply.

He kicked my side again, for good measure. ""So, he's with her. Figures.""

I curled into a ball, my body screaming in pain. But the physical agony was nothing compared to the image in my head: Damien and Carson, together, while I was here, being beaten for his sake.

A deep, primal fear seized me. Not for myself, but for him. Demetrius was unhinged. He could ruin everything Damien had worked so hard for.

Just as Demetrius was about to order his men to hurt me again, his phone rang. He looked at the caller ID and his expression shifted. It was a private number.
He walked a few feet away, turning his back to me. His voice was low, but I could hear snippets of the conversation. ""...Yes... The price we agreed upon... She's a mess, just like you wanted... Don't worry, he'll never find out it was you.""

A deal. He had made a deal.

He hung up and walked back over to me, a look of cold satisfaction on his face. He sneered, then turned and walked out of the warehouse, leaving me with his two thugs.

I thought they were going to k**l me. But a few minutes later, the door opened again.

It was Carson.

She walked in alone, her expensive heels clicking on the concrete floor. She looked at me, crumpled and bleeding, and her face was a mask of cool indifference. She handed one of the thugs a thick envelope of cash. They took it and left without a word.

""Get up,"" she said, her voice devoid of any emotion.

She helped me to my feet, her touch surprisingly strong. ""I'm taking you to a hospital.""

I couldn't speak. My jaw was throbbing, and I was sure some of my teeth were loose.

The hospital was a private clinic, clean and quiet. The doctor was discreet. He stitched my lip, checked my ribs, and fitted me for a temporary dental bridge to cover the gaps where my teeth had been knocked out.

Carson watched from the doorway, her arms crossed. When the doctor was finished, she stepped inside.

""Thank you,"" she said, her voice low. ""For taking the beating that was meant for him.""
She had arranged the whole thing. The threat from Demetrius, the kidnapping, the beating. It was all her. She had created a crisis only she could solve, making Damien even more indebted to her.

""What did you promise Demetrius?"" I managed to ask, my words slurred.

""That's not your concern,"" she said sharply. ""What is your concern is that I can protect Damien, and you can't. You saw it yourself. He left you in a burning building. He didn't answer your call. He has moved on. It's time for you to do the same.""

I spent the next week healing, hiding in the apartment. I walked the city streets at night, revisiting the places that held our history. The cheap diner where we celebrated his first patent. The park where we used to sit for hours, planning a future that would never happen.

The city that had once felt like a promise now felt like a cage. I didn't belong here. I had built my entire world around Damien, and without him, I was just a ghost. He had put down deep roots here, but I was just a weed, easily pulled and discarded.

One evening, my phone rang. It was him.

""Where are you?"" he asked, his voice tight with an emotion I couldn't place.

I told him the name of the park I was in. He was there in ten minutes.

""What are you doing out here alone?"" he asked, his gaze sweeping over my bruised face.

""Remembering,"" I said. ""Do you ever miss it, Damien? The struggle? The days when it was just us against the world?""

He was silent for a long moment. He looked out at the city skyline, at the gleaming towers that represented his success.

""No,"" he said finally, his voice flat and hard. ""I don't. I hate that time. I hate being weak. I hate being a charity case.""

His words were a final, brutal blow. Our past, the foundation I thought our love was built on, was a source of shame for him.
I wanted to ask him, 'Was I a part of that shame? Was my love just a reminder of a past you wanted to erase?'

But I didn't. I already knew the answer.

I forced a smile, the stitches in my lip pulling painfully. ""You're right. We should both look forward, not back.""",1,1754981415.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

I work on a shift schedule and have struggled to make many friendships with peers my age. I have a professional career and work a lot of overtime, but I also have a lot of obligations and interests outside of just partying and drinking that make it hard to make friends. 

I have two well-bred pedigreed dogs who I adore and spend most of my free time training. One is an English Cocker Spaniel and the other is a Golden Retriever.

I like to play video games on xbox, read fiction, (hello Fourth Wing and Zodiac Academy readers) and go thrifting. I am a couple days away from closing on a house and have been obsessed with Tuscan decor so for months now I have been stockpiling decor to be able to decorate once I move in. 

I love fall, pumpkin and coffee(as cliche and basic as  that is) I have also been stockpiling fall decor. 

I am super into liminal photography as well as edits related to strangecore, liminal core, and starflesh. I make a lot of edits for venting and have a couple popular edits online. 

I own land and with the new house I'm super interested in home renovation and diys!! Anyone with experience in renovation should definitely hmu!!

I have a moderate interest in cars although after an accident last year I find myself not really interested in driving fast anymore, although I've been on a couple different trips up to the mountains and on the Tail of the Dragon.

Speaking of the mountains, Appalachia is probably one of my favorite places on Earth. I make an effort to go on a trip up there at least once a year especially in the fall to see the leaves and go hiking.

really I just want to find some friends with similar interests who I can chat with about things online or in person! I throw parties every couple of months that are really fun and that I spend a lot of time and effort into decorating for with over the top decorations and everything lol!! so if we became close don't be surprised if I spam you with invitations :)

honestly another interest of mine would be hosting a book club for girls who love fiction like I do. we can just chat and giggle about books while sipping on wine and snacking on cheese. 

Hope to hear from you soon!",0,1754981393.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1mo1iwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1mo1iwz/whats_the_best_way_to_get_affordable_product/,What’s the Best Way to Get Affordable Product Photos for Your Small Business?,"Hey r/smallbusiness, I’m running a small e-commerce shop selling on Etsy and Shopify, and I need good product photos to stand out buyers skip anything that looks boring. 



My phone pics looked cheap, like garage sale stuff, so I wanted pro-quality shots. Local photographers quoted crazy prices, and it’d take days or a week to get the photos. I tried AI instead **(I know, somehow everyone hates AI, but it's true eaze way)**, checked some online guides, and got solid results. I’m curious: what’s your go-to for product photos as a small business?



Traditional photoshoots in the US are expensive. A regular model costs $200-500/hour, more in cities like NYC, or $1500-3000/day. Pro models run $500-1000/hour or $3000-8000/day. Influencers? Thousands to tens of thousands, depending on their following. Add photographers ($500-2000/half-day, $1000-5000/day), makeup/styling ($300-1000), location rentals (hundreds to thousands), and editing (hundreds to thousands more). A basic shoot with a few scenes hits $1000-5000 easily, and the process takes days or a week.I don’t know much about photography or PS I’d love to make my products (and even my cat!) look better,

AI photos were much easier. I took phone pics of my product on a white sheet, uploaded them to **Google’s Imagen 4**, chose a “Nordic wooden table with soft light” template, and got a nice photo in 30 seconds. I tweaked prompts like “minimalist product on wooden table, soft natural light, Scandinavian style” after some trial and error, using tips from Reddit and X.

**Google’s Gemini 2.0** Flash was great I told it to add a coffee pot next to the product, and it was done in 10 seconds. 

**Imagen 4** is $0.04-$0.06/image, **OpenAI**’s gpt-image-1 is $0.02-$0.19

xAI’s **grok-2**\-image-1212 is $0.07. I made 20 photos for under $2.

For shots with people, I generated a product-plus-model image, then used AI face swap to match European, Asian, or other markets. It’s way cheaper and faster than hiring multiple models. 

I also tried

1. [Remaker AI](https://remaker.ai/face-swap-free/?utm_source=reddit), which was solid and offers free credits for new users to experiment. 

2. [Magic Hour AI](https://magichour.ai/products/face-swap) worked okay but was slower and added watermarks. 

3. [Pixir ](https://pixlr.com/face-swap/)was decent, though face details weren’t great and it had watermarks too. 

Still, AI takes work finding good prompts and fixing issues like weird face lighting can be a hassle. 

Do you use AI tools for product photos to save money, or go with traditional shoots for quality? What AI tools or prompt tricks work best for you, and how do the costs compare? Share your thoughts!

# Chapter 1

Fresh from her postpartum confinement, Amelia Austin took her newborn daughter to the Social Security Administration to register her Social Security Number.

“Hello, I’d like to register the name Finn Robinson for my baby.”

The clerk typed for a moment, then frowned deeper and deeper. “That can’t be right. There’s already a child named Finn Robinson listed under Edmond Robinson’s household registry.”

Amelia froze, thinking she’d misheard. “That’s impossible. Our daughter was only born a month ago!”

Before the words had fully left her mouth, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She unlocked the screen to see a message from Edmond’s assistant, Blanche Flores.

Attached was a photo—Edmond’s left arm wrapped around Blanche’s waist, his right cradling a boy who looked about five or six. The three of them were standing outside a kindergarten, smiling like the picture of domestic bliss.

Pinned to the boy’s chest was a school ID tag. “Finn Robinson,” it read, clear as day.

A message followed right after:

\[Miss Austin, how does it feel to be the other woman? You’ll spend the rest of your life living in the shadow of the real wife—me.\]

It felt like a steel vise had clamped around her heart. Amelia’s fingertips trembled as she spoke to the officer.

“Could you… check Edmond Robinson’s marriage record for me?”

The printer spat out a page. Though light, it landed in her hand with the crushing weight of a sledgehammer. In the “spouse” column next to Edmond’s name, it read: Blanche Flores. The marriage had been registered seven years ago.

“Ma’am, would you still like to proceed with your daughter’s registration?” the clerk asked. His voice felt like it came from miles away.

Amelia looked down at her baby, peacefully asleep in her arms, and forced a bitter smile.

“Register her under my name,” she said softly. “And… change her name, too.”

Amelia walked out of the station on legs that felt like jelly. Her phone buzzed again. This time, it was a message from Edmond.

\[Hey babe, still stuck in meetings. I’ll be home later to spend time with you and the baby.\]

“Babe.” She almost laughed.

He’d called her that every day of their marriage. He never forgot to check in when leaving for work or give her a hug when coming home. Every little act of tenderness, once so cherished, now felt like barbed wire.

Sliding into the driver’s seat, her hands shook so badly she couldn’t get the key into the ignition.

She’d always known how the world of the wealthy worked—most high-society couples played by their own rules. But Edmond had been the exception.

Once, at an event, when a young lady of note had insulted her in front of everyone, Edmond bankrupted her entire family the very next day and forced them to leave the city. He remembered her casually admiring a limited-edition boutique piece. That same night, he’d flown halfway across the globe to get it, just to make her smile.

But what haunted her most was the time of a hospital mix-up during a routine checkup. The nurse had handed him a report claiming she had late-stage kidney failure.

Edmond’s face had gone white. He grabbed the doctor’s coat and shouted like a madman:

“Take mine! Take both my kidneys! If she dies, I’m going with her!”

It turned out to be a mistake. And that cold, ruthless businessman had sat in the hallway, sobbing like a child:

“Thank God, Amy. You’re okay. That’s all that matters…”

People warned her: the more powerful Edmond became, the more temptations would surround him. But he’d always treated her so well, so earnestly, that doubt never had a place in her heart.

So why Blanche?

Edmond used to look down on her more than anyone. Blanche had been the Austins’ maid. One day, she brought Edmond coffee while wearing a low-cut dress.

He shattered the cup on the spot and barked:

“Don’t play cheap tricks in front of me. Don’t bother coming back tomorrow.”

Then he pulled Amelia into his arms, eyes burning with intensity.

“Amy, you’re the only one I want. I won’t tolerate filth like her around you.”

Blanche had crumpled to her knees, sobbing and begging for mercy.

“I only love Amelia. I don’t entertain garbage. Don’t ever show your face to me again.”

She’d packed up and left that same day.

A few months later, Edmond hired her back as his personal assistant. He told Amelia:

“She lost her job, and her family was going to marry her off to some old creep. She started threatening suicide. I’d rather keep her under my watch than risk her stirring up trouble.”

Amelia had believed him. Never would she have guessed that the two of them had been sneaking around under her nose for six whole years—and had a child together.

Clenching her jaw against the sting behind her eyes, Amelia called a private investigator.

Thirty minutes later, a video came in with a GPS pin. She drove straight to the location.

Edmond wasn’t in a meeting. He’d just come from Finn’s kindergarten parent-teacher conference.

Hand in hand with Blanche, their son in his arms, the three of them crossed the street like a picture-perfect family. The soft smile on Edmond’s face was more genuine than any family photo they’d ever taken—and it sliced through her like glass.

Amelia tailed them to a gated suburban villa.

She watched Edmond get out of the car first, lifting a huge box of toys from the trunk. The boy squealed in delight and ran off with the loot. Blanche leaned into Edmond, teasing, “You spoil him too much.”

“He’s my son. Who else should I spoil?” Edmond grinned and kissed her on the lips. “He won the most gold stars today. Made me proud.”

Blanche’s eyes welled up. “Thank you, Ed, for enrolling him in the best private school. I never thought…”

She hesitated, voice trembling. “When I got pregnant, it was an accident. I never planned to intrude. I only wanted to watch from afar. We were never going to ruin things for you and Amelia—”

“Stop it.” Edmond cupped her cheek, voice firm but low.

“She’ll never know. Besides, you are the one on my marriage license. Of course I’ll take care of you and Finn. You’re my family.”

Blanche finally smiled through her tears. Edmond leaned closer and murmured something in her ear that made her blush bright red. Then he swept her into his arms and carried her inside.

Amelia sat frozen in her car, feeling like her heart had been sawed open with a dull blade. She barely remembered how she drove back home.

That night, Edmond returned as usual. As soon as he stepped inside, he opened his arms for a hug.

“Babe, did you wait long? Tired from taking care of the baby today?”

Amelia quietly shifted to the side. “About our daughter’s registration…”

“I’ll handle that later,” he cut her off sharply. Then, softening his tone: “Those procedures are a nightmare. You just got through recovery—leave it to me, okay?”

She nodded, lashes lowered. She didn’t tell him their daughter was already registered under her name.

She also didn’t mention the call she made on the way home.

To Edmond’s most hated rival. Holding her phone steady, her voice calm but resolute, she said:",2,1754980965.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1mo1f9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1mo1f9i/9_simple_habits_i_did_everyday_that_helped_me/,9 simple habits I did everyday that helped me lose 20 kg,"used to think success meant massive transformations overnight.

Hit the gym for 2 hours. Read 50 pages a day. Completely overhaul my diet. Go from zero to hero in a week.

You know what happened? I'd burn out in 5 days and quit everything. So I decided to take a step back. And start from the bottom. 2 years later I've read over 20 books and have lost 20kg.

Here are the 9 stupidly simple habits that transformed my life one tiny step at a time:

* Habit 1 - Read 10 pages every morning. Not 50. Not a whole book. Just 10 pages with your coffee. That's 3,650 pages a year. About 12-15 books. You'll accidentally become one of the most well-read people you know.
* Habit 2 - Did 10 push ups the moment I woke up. Before checking your phone. Before coffee. Before anything else. It's not about getting ripped. It's about proving to yourself that you can do hard things first thing in the morning.
* Habit 3 - Writing down what I'm grateful for. Takes 2 minutes. Rewires your brain to notice good things instead of only problems. After 6 months, you'll be the person who finds silver linings while everyone else complains.
* Habit 4 - Drinking water before doing anything. 2 glasses of water when you wake up. Before coffee, before anything. Your brain is dehydrated after 8 hours of sleep. Feed it water first, stimulants second.
* Habit 5 - Making the bed Sounds stupid. Works incredibly well. You start every day with a completed task. You end every day coming home to something neat and organized.
* Habit 6 - Daily walks after a meal. Not a workout. Just a walk around the block. Better digestion, improved mood, clearer thinking. Plus you'll accidentally get 8,000+ steps a day.
* Habit 7 - Phone in another room at night. Charge it somewhere else. Use an actual alarm clock. Better sleep, better mornings, less mindless scrolling. Your future self will thank you.
* Habit 8 - Learned everyday. A word. A fact. A skill. Anything. Watch a 5-minute YouTube tutorial. Read a Wikipedia page. Ask someone to teach you something.
* Habit 9 - Planned the day before. Spend 5 minutes writing down your top 3 priorities for the next day. Wake up with purpose instead of decision fatigue.

It took sometime to fully integrate all this habits but I'm so glad I pushed through. I hope I motivate you to do the same as well.

I’m a 21 year old (f) line cook at a bistro attached to a vineyard. I’ve been here just shy of a month. Before working here, I worked at a chain brunch place on “egg” and “salad” stations (I suppose this would be the equivalent of sauté and garde manger) and before that I worked in fast food, rolling burritos at Taco Bell and making sandwiches and coffee at Panera.   

I left the chain brunch place because my opportunities to learn and grow plateaued really quickly. I made serious efforts to learn the other stations but got pigeon holed to mine and the work environment was a little rough. Didn’t appreciate the games of grab-ass my manager kept trying to initiate and the corporate feel of the place left a sour taste in my mouth. Even though I was making a little more money on the hour there, my current workplace seems to offer more opportunities for growth and more applicable skills that I could take to other restaurants if I wanted. None of the food I serve is pre-cooked Sysco slop. 

My current job is making me really fall in love with cooking in a restaurant. Honestly, though, I sometimes felt a little twinge of this even working at Taco Bell or that awful brunch place. I’ve always loved the mid-rush flow state when there’s no time to think, there’s just tickets and food and figuring out how to do as much as I can with as little movement as possible. 

I’m learning a lot at my current job. The chef is incredibly patient and willing to teach, but has high expectations and will tell you when you haven’t met them, usually with a “get it the fuck together.” 

I don’t have a chef jacket. Or my own knives. Or a culinary degree like most of the people I work with at the bistro. I have non-slips from Shoes for Crews and burn scars all over my hands and forearms and a somewhat recently acquired passion for this business. I’m wondering if this is enough. 

I’m in college right now, studying Philosophy, mostly because I graduated high school and had no idea what I wanted to do with my life. I have three semesters left until I graduate college. I’m trying to figure out if I should push through and finish my degree, or save myself the debt and keep at it as a cook. 

And if I want to pursue a culinary career, how much will culinary school help me? Ideally, I’d keep working in a restaurant while I went to school to fill in the knowledge gaps, but taking on more student debt is scary.

I know my girlfriend would appreciate it not being too complicated or comprehensive to make a coffee.

I am therefore looking for a grinder below €1,000 - either with hopper or single dose, depending on what you will recommend based on our needs.

1mo1aro,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1mo1aro/an_unwanted_mate_bond/,An unwanted mate bond,"Chapter 1 - An unwanted mate bond

Kaia POV

My own mate rejected me on our wedding night. As soon as I signed the marriage certificate and prepared to consummate our new life together...he rejected me.

“I, Than Sable, Alpha of the Amber Desert Pack, reject you Kaia Glace as my Luna.” I remember his cruel cutting words as if they were only yesterday. But they weren’t, his rejection of our mate bond was two years ago.

The words still resound in my ears even after all this time.

Time, I have wasted being a semi-Luna. Time wasted with a mate that doesn’t even want me.

Than and I met at college. The noisy corridors of college seem like a lifetime ago now, so does the Than I knew back then. As soon as we returned to the Amber Desert Pack, he took on his position as the Alpha. I happily followed to become his Luna, as his mate.

The caring and supportive Than I knew at college changed instantly as soon as we were married. He rejected me even before our wedding night, even before marking me.

I’ve gone over and over again in my head what I must have said, what I did wrong, but each time I came up empty. Every time I asked him, I would get a grunt or an inaudible murmur, so I stopped asking.

His complete reversal in character makes me feel as if I imagined our college days, as if they didn’t even exist and I was living in a dream world.

An illusion.

Our mate bond is non-existent. That’s a lie, it exists but he doesn’t allow himself to get close to me, doesn’t allow himself to be alone in a room with me. It’s as if I disgust him. That it pains him to get close to me.

I hate our mate bond. The very thing that makes my heart flutter as he gets into the room, or the scent of roasted chestnuts that lingers on the furniture.

Even his auburn shaded hair, muscular alpha body and hazel eyes I have come to hate. I hate the way the mate bond tricks me every day.

For an entire year after our wedding there was hardly a time that I saw Than, especially alone. He became exceedingly busy with pack affairs and used it as an excuse to stay away from me.

I tried to solve the issue I may have caused, to save our marriage. I must have done something wrong...

But when I found out what the real problem in our marriage was, I stopped trying. I gave up...because it was just too insurmountable.

So, for the last year I’ve remained quiet in the house he has assigned to me.

In all honesty, I’ve grown tired of the life I lead, this wasn’t the life I imagined for myself.

I tried to communicate with Than. I tried to put across my case to leave the Amber Desert pack, but he always said that there was still time.

I’m not sure what kind of measure of time he was referring to, but I felt out of time.

Anyway, it turned out that I was his ""Luna"", but in reality, I was his imprisoned canary.

However, I never gave up and ran, because I felt that my life should not be like this, and besides, I also had my own things that needed to be resolved.

“Kaia?” His growl reaches my ears as I sit in my bedroom, an internal sigh escaping me for his disturbance.

I walk out of my bedroom and downstairs, at first thinking I imagined his voice. Because why would he be here?

But his lingering scent was the key detail of him actually being here.

I walk into my living area to find him standing, his back to me. I can feel the chemical reaction of the mate bond trying to encourage me to touch him, to give into that gravitational pull to once again experience those tingles that only a mate can give.

I resist.

“What are you doing here?” He never visits me, why now.

“This is my pack, I can go wherever I want.” His voice holds an irritation to it.

He has clearly been in night training; he is sweaty and dirty...his white tight vest now tingeing on the grey side, his jeans muddy from being left on the ground. His auburn hair now shaved down, not the long boyish strands I used to enjoy running my fingers through.

He spins, his eyes turning a deeper brown as they flash at me...I’m only wearing a black slip. I thought I’d be alone as usual, no point dressing up for oneself.

“Than, why are you here?”

“I’ve incurred a slight problem...”

“A slight problem? And I can help how?”

He doesn’t respond to me, but he finds himself comfortable enough to walk into my kitchen and fetch my bottle of vodka. By the smell reaching my nostrils, he’s already downed a bottle of whiskey this night. I won’t talk to him like this, he can walk himself out.

I head up the stairs, towards my bedroom when I hear his footsteps following me up the stairs. I turn to face him on the landing, his peculiar behaviour piquing my interest.

His hand pulls at my arm, pulling me into him, his mouth taking me off guard as they almost touch mine. “It would seem I need to have a child...” His voice is cold...holding some kind of resentment.

“A child?” I hide my scoff internally, as my wolf growls in my mind. She hates him, hates him for rejecting us.

His eyes are on me now for my disrespectful comment. His aura increasing, an invisible command trying to force me to submit.

He’s always struggled to make me submit and it gives me deep joy to know how much that grates on him.

He doesn’t know why.

“Can I ask why now? Where has this come from? Let’s not pretend that you have any feelings for me Than. Why bring a child up in this unloving and toxic environment?” I untangle myself from his hold and create some much-needed distance between us.

“The pack needs an heir; you are the Luna after all.”

He does what I was praying to the moon goddess for him not to do, he starts walking towards me. His prowling steps resulting in my spine to shiver.

This man was your typical alpha...tall, muscles, predatory eyes to help seal the solve...but it’s the inside that sickens me.

Yet there’s as part of me that hopes I have it wrong, that there has been some kind of misunderstanding between us since the wedding...because why would we be matched together?

As he comes closer his scent tickles at my senses, the roasted chestnut smell now mixed with heavy pungent.

He’s in front of me before I can do anything, his hand stroking at my face. A deep gulp forming in his throat, as if it pains him to touch me.

As soon as his fingers are on me, I want to moan with pleasure from his touch, from the tingles that I hadn’t felt in so long.

I’m entranced by the tingles that just naturally continue, as his mouth kisses the tip of my shoulder. He pulls at my black spaghetti slip strap, running his tongue across the skin.

A guttural moan escapes me as my head rolls back. I push my wolf away, was it selfish of me to enjoy what was owed to me? What was destined to me?

“It’s just a child Kaia...” He slurs on his own words as his hand grips at my neck, his hand angling my neck...a growl rumbling in his body.

Just a child? How can he say that?

The mate bond was already weaving its magic. His closeness was doing things to me, his scent overpowering my thought process. I hated how the mate bond reduced me to this.

“Say yes...” His mouth are by my ear and I have to bite down on my tongue to keep myself.

My body is lost in the lustful feel of his touch at my lower core as his other hand lifts under my hem and pushes my underwear aside. His other hand remains at my neck, keeping me upright as his thumb now creates circular motions at my private part.

Would a child make him love me again? Would a child bring us closer?

I don’t think so, how could I knowingly bring a child into a relationship where the father can’t be in the same room as the mother.

“No!” I gasp out, my body now fighting against the mate bond. Waking up from its spell.

“No?” He seethes in my ear, his hand tightening around my neck.

“No, I said no.” I snarl at him, the tightness around my throat now hurting.

I start to push him, but he is built like a brick wall. He doesn’t listen to my rejection, his hand continuing down below.

“Get your hands off me...” I snarl at him, my teeth close enough to his face to bite.

His jaw tense, as his eyes glare at me.

He pushes me back into my bedroom where the back of my legs hit against the bed. I lift my leg to kick him where it hurts, to snap him out of his lustful haze. But he blocks my knee with his, pushing my legs apart.

Still holding onto my throat, he pushes us onto the edge of the bed where I am locked in his hold, using all my strength to fight it.

His other hand is now blocking my punches and clawing attempts, before I feel him grip tightly onto my buttock. I hear him unzip his jeans, the denim dropping to the floor.

Before I know it, he thrusts into me, too hard. I can feel myself burning inside as he overstretches me.

Something inside of me freezes, telling me that I want this child...the treacherous mate bond trying to convince me even now.

Tears are flowing down my face as I struggle with his harsh thrusts.

I’m pinned, not making any movement at all. His hand now off my neck and both pinning my body down.

I can’t look at him, my eyes are slammed shut, I know I’ll relive this...I want the memory already gone.

I’m not sure what the measure of time is but it feels like an eternity before I feel him chasing his own release.

“Alora...” He lowly growls as I feel him climax.

Tears escape me as I lay still. As he releases his tight hold on me, my hands clamp over my mouth to keep my sobs silent.

Alora.

She was the reason my marriage was a fake.

She was my marital nightmare.

Chapter 2 - Beyond belief

Kaia POV

I couldn’t sleep, not with him next to me. He hasn’t moved, and I’m frozen as his arm lays across my waist, as if what had just happened was a happy thing for me. As if he were trying to keep me safe.

My mind keeps going over and over what had just happened.

Reliving every moment.

He called out her name...her name.

Alora.

She was the person that Than loved deeply, she was the reason why he never gave our mate bond a chance.

He has thrown it away for her!

I don’t even know who she is, where she is. All I know from snippets of information is that she was in a coma, and Than could never get over her.

That’s when I stopped trying to work on our mate bond. I couldn’t fight against something so strong that it would overpower a mate bond….

A mate bond that is designed by the Moon Goddess herself.

I knew that no matter what I tried, how much I tried to change myself for him...I could never escape the curse of Alora. It was far better for my own wellbeing to just let them be.

His use of her name whilst inside of me, as she lays in a coma, is enough proof that

I will never be able to replace her in his heart.

................

When he woke up, I pretended to be asleep, I couldn’t look him in the eyes.

When I finally went downstairs, I hoped he would have left, returned to the alpha house for breakfast. But my heart feels strained as I smell his scent in the kitchen.

I sigh internally at the realisation that he has stayed.

He plates up some breakfast food on the table, it didn’t matter what he made, I know I haven’t got the stomach to eat this morning.

Usually, I can enjoy my food peacefully knowing I am alone.

But I can’t eat, thanks to him I now feel awkward in my own house. He keeps looking at me, yet I can’t look at him. I can sense his regret, that he wants to apologise but I can’t hear it...not right now.

“Kaia...” His voice calls out my name. My ears hearing it as if he were miles away, not sitting across the table from me. I didn’t even realise I was lost in deep thought.

I finally look up at him as he places his cutlery on the table, his plate just as full as mine.

Also untouched.

The constant rubbing of his forehead informs me that he has a heavy hangover and is feeling remorse.

“I...” He starts to speak, his mouth open but his mouth unable to form any words. I continue to look up at him, to see him in a distressed way when the door slams open...with Zane rushing in, closely followed by Freya.

“Zane, now’s not a good time.” He growls lowly at the intrusion of his beta.

An intrusion into my home. Something that was also starting to feel as if it were being taken away from me.

“Apologies Alpha but the pack doctor has news...You won’t believe it but Alora is showing signs of waking up.”

“What?” Than’s eyes are wide as he jumps to his feet, sprinting away.

As he hastily tries to leave my house, he doesn’t even look back at me as he runs to the front door, followed by Zane.

Their frantic departure leaves an unsettled feeling within me, my wolf trying to voice her concern.

“What will you do if she really wakes up?” Freya quietly asks me as she picks up Than’s plate and takes it into the kitchen.

“What can I do?” I shrug helplessly, as I push the plate aside, all appetite has completely left me now.

I slowly stand up and willingly return to my room...to be alone.

…….

My mind needed an outlet, it needed normality. To complete a task, I had some level of control over.

Turning on my laptop I notice that I have received an email.

Opening the email it informs me that there was still no progress on the investigation into Father. The email reads that there is a possibility that he might have been sighted at the Dark Phantom Pack.

I haven’t seen Father since I was sixteen. Not since our pack was attacked and he asked my immediate departure.

Closing the laptop, I look down at my wrist. I only now notice Than’s finger marks still evident from last night. Nausea overwhelms me and I rush into the bathroom and vomit into the toilet.

Needing to clean myself, I manage to step into the shower, my lower core still sore from last night, from his overzealous actions. I wanted to wash him off me.

I turn off the water and reach for a towel. As I dry myself off in front of the long mirror, I’m shocked to see the marks and bruises all over my body.

The most prominent on my neck and back, how had I not noticed already? I’m littered with both physical and mental scars of what he has done to me.

I must spend the next hour sitting at the edge of the bed, staring at myself in the mirror.

Freya’s words recalling in my mind...“What will you do if she really wakes up?”

What will I do if she wakes up? If she never wakes up, will I be able to survive like this forever?

Perhaps seeing her will help me to decide, perhaps seeing her will answer some questions.

I feel as if seeing her will shed some light on my confusion...

I need to see her....

.....

That evening, I couldn’t stop my curiosity getting the better of me.

I know I shouldn’t go,

I should stay in my home, lock the doors and keep myself to myself. But I couldn’t help it, my intrigue was too strong.

Against my better judgement I left my house and sneaked through the pack, everyone fast asleep. The pack at its quietest.

I dressed to disguise myself. I didn’t need to bother with my hoodie, not one person stopped me or even recognised me when I reached the hospital.

Some Luna I was eh?

I followed my wolf’s intuition. Surely a person in a coma would be in the intensive care unit? I don’t even know what she looks like. All I have to go by is the name Alora.

Keeping my face hidden as much as I can, I locate the patient board to find her assigned to room B5. It takes me a few moments to build up the courage to get into her room.

Was I being disrespectful? Visiting someone who was in a coma?

No, he’s betrayed me by choosing her over our mate bond. Denying my place as Luna because of her.

I shouldn’t be here, this was wrong. But I can’t seem to control my own behaviour.

I nervously push the door open, my eyes darting immediately to the girl attached to a ventilator for breathing.

This was the person that has captured my mate’s heart so deeply that I never stood a chance? This was my competition? A girl that can’t even breathe by herself?

This is who he has been holding back on me for, on our mate bond....

I slowly walk up to her, my hand already stretched out. My heartbeat becoming faster and faster until I get a closer look at the still body lying on the hospital bed.

I take one last look at her before I...

As my eyes gaze upon her, my body freezes like a statue before my eyes have a chance to catch up.

She looks exactly like me?

My heart continues to race and my head starts to rush, a dizzy spell threatening to take over me.

Is that why I am here, why I am in this pack... Because I look like her?

Chapter 3 - A cold hearted mate

Kaia POV

She’s my double, identical to me. Her skin isn’t as olive toned as mine, she’s paler from having been away from the sunlight, from being stuck in this hospital bed...but there’s no doubt that she is my double.

My mind can’t seem to process what my eyes are seeing.

How was this even possible?

I walk to the end of the bed, picking up her medical record to see what happened to her.

Than never speaks of her. Apparently never letting anyone get close enough to visit her.

Reading the report, it says she consumed wolfsbane.

Wolfsbane? What would have possessed her to do that? Wolfsbane isn’t something you drink accidentally. It’s a controlled substance, it’s incredibly hard to get hold of.

It’s meant to be excruciatingly painful to consume, an unbearable pain.

I didn’t dare to stay here any longer. I mechanically put the medical record back and walked out of her room, off the entire hospital ward.

I’m not even sure how I got back home. I must have gone into robot mode, my mind taking over as my body remained in a level of shock. I just feel like my legs are shaking all the time, only just keeping it together until I am alone in my own house.

Once I close the front door my mind and body finally reconnect, and I have to hold onto the wall for support.

My legs finally give way as I slowly fall against the wall onto the floor.

My legs tuck into my heart, calling out for my arms to embrace them, which I do.

I provide myself the only support I’ll ever get.

I just sit on the floor trying to work on calming my breathing down.

Why did Alora and I look so similar? She was skinny from being on life support, her face sunken but there was no mistaking our similarities.

More than similarities, our mirror image.

Wait...he approached me at college, made a point of introducing himself to me. Is that why? Because I look like her?

Did he even feel the humming of our bond, the gravitational pull... Or did he only come up to me because I resembled his comatose beloved?

I was an Alora substitute...

I haven’t moved all night, my back sore from having sat all night in the same position, against the hard wall.

What was I really doing here? This question has been plaguing me all night.

That’s when I heard him. It must be the break of dawn for him to be outside on his way to training.

Anger takes over me, my wolf using my bereaved state...because I was in bereavement, bereavement for a mate bond that will never be. For being tricked for too long.

“I saw her!” I call out to him as I open my front door. He turns to face me before ushering his beta, Zane, to continue without him.

“Saw who?” He walks closer to my house but doesn’t come in. I don’t think I want him in here now anyhow.

“Alora.”

His eyes that weren’t particularly interested in talking to me, now dart immediately to mine.

“You have?” He takes a step closer to me, his arm now raised and leaning against the top of my porch.

“Is that the only reason you spoke to me that day at college, because I look like her?”

“Yes!” He answers too quick, too cold hearted.

“Does the mate bond mean nothing to you?” I start to shake, my own words sounding higher than I anticipated.

“How could you...” I whisper out.

“Well now you know, there is nothing to hide.” He starts to back away, not even trying to fight for me once.

Not even an apology...resulting in my anger boiling over.

“You’re a dickhead, I hate you! Don’t come anywhere near me or my house again!” I scream out at him, slamming the door unable to look at him any longer.

........

2 months later

I haven’t seen Than once in the last 2 weeks.

Not once.

Rumour has it that he’s been by Alora’s bed side every day and night. Freya also informed me that the signs of her reawakening are becoming more and more evident.

I’ve increasingly been feeling more uncomfortable in my own skin and with Than being constantly at the hospital it has afforded me a chance to secretly get a baby test.

I’ve not had a chance to look at it yet, I’ve been standing here for 20 minutes unable to pick it up from the sink. What if I am?

What will that mean for this sick weird love triangle I’m finding myself in?

“Come on Kaia, we can figure it out together. Just look at it.” My wolf encourages me to find the strength to check the result.

With her companionship and support, I find the courage to look at the results.

“Two lines...” I gasp, my hand clasping at my mouth.

“Two lines...that’s good right? Means a negative?” My wolf’s voice sounds in my head.

“No, two lines is...” I check the box again just to be certain.

“Positive. What am I going to do?”

The positive test sat next to me all night on my bedside table. I couldn’t keep my eyes off it. I had to check it numerous of times in the night to make sure I read the results correctly.

Pulling myself out of bed I knew I had to tell him. As much as I hate him right now, this child is still the pack heir.

He’ll either be at the alpha home or the hospital, and I’d rather tell him without her being in the same room. Hence, I was already heading to the alpha house first to check.

As I reach the front garden, both he and Beta Zane head out of the front door together.

I’m not sure what possesses me to do so, but I hide behind one of the large trees as not to be seen.

“Why not wait until Alora wakes up to have a child?”

“We need an heir now, to strengthen the future of this pack.”

“What if Kaia gives you a child, and Alora wakes up?”

“Simple, the child is mine.”

“And Kaia?”

“If Alora wakes up, the wolfsbane has ravaged her kidneys to a stage of disrepair. Kaia will be the organ donor. She won’t have a choice! The doctors already know the score.”

I stop listening, blood bumping in my ears blocking out any other noise.

Organ donor? For her?

Chapter 4 - Making a decision

Kaia POV

I watch them walk away into the distance, my mind spinning at what I had just heard.

Kidney donation?

I never thought that Than’s purpose was to use my kidney to save Alora...

This is ridiculous!

So, from beginning to end I was a meaningless existence to him. He only thought of me as just an organ donor...even though we were mates for goddess’s sake.

He was only with me for a kidney. How could he be like this...cruel!

My brain couldn’t think anymore, and the strong buzzing of overthinking was giving me a splitting headache. What little hope I had was shattered and I couldn’t find any reason to continue living.

“You need to remain strong...” My wolf’s encouraging words filter into my mind.

“...you are with child.”

“Yes, you’re right.” I wipe away my tears, I must stay strong for the baby. I couldn’t just sit back and wait for death. I now have an innocent child to fight for.

Suddenly, I feel as if all eyes and ears of the pack are on me, all serving Than, spies all ready to betray me.

I can’t remain, I can’t stay and wait for Alora to wake, wait for my death. I can’t trust anybody.

I have no choice... Run!

I must run...

....

It’s been a week since I decided to leave, and I haven’t seen Than during this entire week.

This morning Freya said that Alora had physical reactions, showing more signs of her imminent reawakening.

Thinking she may wake in the next few days, I planned my escape already but have now pushed it forward to tonight. I couldn’t wait any longer.

At midnight, I waited until the cover of darkness to executive my plan of escape.

I try my best to avoid places where pack members were on duty. I knew I needed to get to the gate, hoping the midnight shift change may be my opportunity to elude the guards.

I’m using the path that runs adjacent to the training field, thinking no one should be training now.

Only to find Than exercising with a warrior...

I duck behind a tree praying to the moon goddess that I hadn’t been seen.

They both stop, looking towards the wooded area, my heart thumping as I hide behind a tree.

“Kaia?” His eyes scan the area as I feel him push on my mind-link. He must have seen me after all.

Closing my eyes to concentrate, I don’t give anything away.

I make it seem like I am asleep...not even attempting to push him out of my mind.

Only moving again when he returns to training.

Now changing my route, I manage to get close to the gate remaining undetected.

I watch from the shadows, waiting for the most opportune time to escape when the hairs on the back of my neck stand up as I sense someone now behind me.

“What are you doing?” Than finds me crouched down, a humorous smirk upon his face.

Was my life funny to him?

“I’m leaving Than. I’m not staying anymore.” I stand up, straightening my back.

“I don’t think so...” He takes a step towards me but is interrupted by the warrior he was training with. “Alpha? Beta Zane says you need to return to the hospital...”

“Not now.”

“He says, she’s awake?” The warrior seems to not understand the own words relaying on his lips from the beta’s mind-link.

Than stares me down for a moment before spinning on his heel, his warrior following him.

I am now left alone, this was my only chance...her reawakening giving me a chance to leave.

I don’t give the pack grounds another look, I run straight out of the gate.

........

I kept running until I reached the nearest city. It didn’t take long for Than to know I left through those gates...his warriors tracking me throughout the night.

I manage to find a secluded coffee shop where I find time to rest, my feet are burning and my throat is dry from thirst.

I have a baby and have no pack. What should I do now? I’m not entirely sure but I know no matter what challenges are ahead of me, I refuse to return to the Amber Desert pack...to Than.

“You aren’t from around here, which pack are you from?” The silver haired elderly coffee shop owner asks as he refills my coffee cup. He’s been watching me for a while now, knowing I am not human like the other customers.

“No, I’m looking for someone...someone who was last seen at a pack...”

“Which pack?” He mutters under his breath, keeping his voice low.

“The Dark Phantom pack?” I shrug my shoulders not expecting him to have heard of the pack, but I catch his eyes glaze over slightly into a mind-link.

“What business have you with that pack?”

“I’m trying to track someone down. Do you have a map? Can you show me the location?” I ask with slight hope, but he shakes his head before returning to his regular customers.

I remain for around another hour, the owner ignoring my attempts at making eye contact with him. He hasn’t returned once to me but has all the other customers.

I return my used coffee cup to the counter, readying to settle my bill when the cute bell rings signalling the door has been opened.

That’s when the most intoxicating scent hits me.

Burnt oranges with dark chocolate.

The smell invades my nostrils, the scent causing my mouth to salivate.

With my back on the door, I turn, but I already find a tall strong male engulfing my frame from behind.

“I hear you’ve been asking about me?”

Chapter 5 - Negotiating my future

Kaia POV

“I hear you’ve been asking about me?” The tall man smiles slightly at me, his eyes remaining on mine. Our eyes lock together as something inside of me doesn’t want to look away.

My head and eyes aren’t connecting...something is happening from the affect of his scent. Something I can’t quite register.

His eyes are grey charcoal, like the ash left over from an extinguished fire yet still hold that ember warmth. He is well dressed, a slim fitting black suit with a grey tie...which purposefully brings out his eyes.

He was exquisite. Groomed to perfection.

My fingers are itching to run through his dark brown hair, to ruffle up the perfect hairstyle.

I even clench my hands into fists to stop them from reaching up and touching him.

It is only when he blinks, breaking the eye connection that my wolf finally pushes through this haze that I have been caught up in....

“Mate!” She screams for joy, her enthusiasm not quite as strong as mine...not just yet.

Mate? How is that even possible?

I match his slight smile, readying to respond when it occurs to me...why isn’t he reacting like me?

He doesn’t seem to be struggling to breathe like I am.

He is composed, his hands normal...not even slightly clenched to prevent them from pulling me into him.

From claiming me as his.

He’s acting as if everything is normal, as if I wasn’t also his mate. As if my mere presence wasn’t sending his wolf into disarray like it is me.

I’d think I would have imagined it all. I am right, aren’t I? I’m not imagining it...

“You were asking about me?” He clears his throat forcing me to wake up from the spell his presence has created on me.

“About my pack?” His face now changes into a slight playful expression.

“Your pack?” I repeat, still trying to refocus.

“Yes, I am the Alpha of the Dark Phantom pack...”

The Alpha?

It would explain his strong aura that has taken over the coffee shop, even the humans are looking at him without realizing why.

Their natural born senses flaring up which they now choose to ignore. It was clear he was a very powerful man.

“Only that I’ve heard about it and was just curious.” I respond, trying to sound unbothered about the information now.

I had to be careful here, if Father was last seen at his pack...they most definitely would have met.

This pack was notorious, and I was now standing in front of the Alpha.

I can’t let him know I am related to Father. I’ll have to continue to keep my identity a secret like before.

Yet I am now a rogue and need somewhere to stay and lay low. A place I can reassess my future plans without living like an actual rogue.

I don’t know why, but the Amber Desert and the Dark Phantom pack have had a long-standing hatred for one another.

Than never mentioned the reason, in fact refusing that the enemy pack should ever be mentioned.

If this alpha found out I was from Than’s pack..well I don’t want to think about it.

I’ll have to keep it hidden that I am from the Amber Desert pack.

“Perhaps I could join the Dark Phantom pack? I am looking for a new pack...” I place some money on the counter, acting cooly. As if I were ready to leave at any second...his pack not being the opportunity I now desperately needed. Even though it was classed as the enemy pack.

“So you are a rogue?” He laughs out loud, his eyes continuing to watch me carefully.

“Do you take in rogues?”

“Becoming a Dark Phantom pack member requires...certain tests.” He winks before his eyes glaze over.

“What kind of tests?” I ask, my eyes diverting to a male walking through the coffee shop door.

“Strict tests...extensive running, fighting, using guns, jumping from rooftops...” The new male counts each test on his fingers as the alpha moves away from us, engaging in a small conversation with the coffee shop owner.

He may be away from me now, but his eyes remain on me, readying to act. As if thinking I was going to run, little does he know I have nowhere to run.

“...underwater breathing...” The new male catches my attention.

“Underwater breathing? Whatever for?” I cut the man off, these tests were absurd and something I just couldn’t do.

I couldn’t even shift right now.

“I have other abilities I can bring to the pack...” I offer to the male as his fingers remain held up high in front of me as he has listed things I would be expected to do.

“Oh?” The male’s eyes scan to his superior before the alpha sits on a high stool at the counter and takes a sip of coffee.

“You really want to join my pack?” His eyes brighten slightly as he blows on the steaming hot coffee.

My wolf was still howling in my mind, almost whimpering as his wolf doesn’t even recognize her. But things were different now, I needed a place to keep safe.

A place to be protected from Than, because he will continue to look for me...I was Alora’s lifeline. He’d never give up.

Although the Dark Phantom pack was known as dangerous, perhaps its reputation will afford me the protection I require. Perhaps being the enemy pack, Than won’t think to look here.

“Yes.” I reply after a small pause. I also need to find Father; this pack might hold the answers I need.

The alpha jumps up from his stool with a smile. A smile that quickly turns into a serious expression as he once again closes in on me.

“I know who you are.”

1mo19ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ayurveda/comments/1mo19ko/how_is_ayurvedic_medicine_more_beneficial_than/,How is Ayurvedic medicine more beneficial than modern medicine?,"I grew up in a family where my grandmother went for warm turmeric milk for a cough-cold, while my doctor’s prescription was antibiotics. For years, I thought Ayurveda was just “grandma’s wisdom” comforting but outdated. Then, in my late twenties, when stress and digestion issues became constant companions, I found myself revisiting Ayurveda.

What I discovered is that Ayurveda isn’t about replacing modern medicine but about **approaching health from a different angle**. Modern medicine is incredible at dealing with emergencies; like if I break a bone or have an infection, I’m heading straight to a hospital. But Ayurveda shines when it comes to **prevention, long-term balance, and root-cause healing**.

Here’s where Ayurveda felt more beneficial for me:

1. **Focus on the root cause, not just symptoms:** When I had recurring acidity, modern medicine gave me pills to neutralize stomach acid. Ayurveda helped me figure out *why* it was happening, irregular meals, excess coffee, and poor sleep, and worked on fixing those habits.
2. **Personalized approach** Modern medicine often uses a “one-size-fits-all” protocol. Ayurveda looks at your unique body type (dosha), lifestyle, and even emotional state before suggesting herbs, diet, or routines.
3. **Holistic lifestyle integration** It’s not just about taking herbal remedies; it’s also about eating according to your digestion, sleeping well, managing stress, and syncing with natural rhythms. This made me feel healthier overall, not just symptom-free.
4. **Minimal side effects** When done correctly (with the right practitioner and quality herbs), Ayurvedic remedies are gentler on the body, especially for chronic issues where long-term medication could have side effects.
5. **Empowerment in self-care** Ayurveda gave me practical daily habits like sipping warm water in the morning, oil massage, or mindful eating that I could do myself, without depending on constant prescriptions.

That said, Ayurveda is not a replacement for modern medicine in acute or life-threatening conditions. For me, the best health outcomes came when I **combined the strengths of both**: modern medicine for emergencies and Ayurveda for prevention and long-term balance.

In short, Ayurveda taught me that true health isn’t just “not being sick”; it’s feeling balanced, energetic, and in tune with my body.",7,1754980183.0,Ayurveda,2,1.0,False
1mo19ef,https://www.reddit.com/r/Contemporary_Romance/comments/1mo19ef/his_rejected_royal_mate_i_was_alpha_adrians/,His Rejected Royal Mate | I was Alpha Adrian's Secret for Eight Years,"I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It took his grandfather’s centennial birthday for him to finally bring our son, Gale, and me home to the pack.

He swore the pack Elders had finally given us their blessing.

Our son, buzzing with excitement, bounced on the bed, clutching the champion’s medal from his junior fighting tournament.

He’d fought tooth and nail to win it, just to make his father proud.

But the moment we set foot on the Blackwood Manor grounds, we saw him.

Adrian, with his arms wrapped around a blonde she-wolf, kissing her deeply.

Adrian introduced her with a smile. ""My mate, Sophia""

Our son, Gale, rushed forward to confront him, stabbing a finger toward the seemingly perfect bite mark on my neck.

""That's the mark Dad gave Mom! You all see it!""

But the pack’s Head Elder stepped forward.

After a cursory glance, he let out a cold sneer.

""A clever trick of blood magic,"" he said with contempt. ""It can mimic a scent, but it lacks the soul-deep connection of a true mate bond. Any experienced wolf can see through it.""

I turned to Adrian, my body frozen stiff.

He turned away from me, gently stroking the real mark on Sophia's neck, which glowed with a silvery, moonlit light.

""The Blackwood pack will not accept a half-blood who can’t even shift"" he said. ""The only one fit to stand by my side is Sophia.""

I looked at him, and a bitter laugh escaped me.

To think I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood for a man like this.

Chapter 1

I was Alpha Adrian's secret for eight years.

It wasn't until I walked in on him kissing his first love that I learned the mating mark he gave me was a fake.

I touched the back of my neck in disbelief.

""Eight years! You lied to me for eight whole years?!""

Everyone’s eyes were on me, but I could only see Adrian's expressionless face.

The face I had kissed countless times, the one I thought I would spend my life with.

""What is this, then?"" I ripped my collar open, revealing the delicate, crescent-shaped bite mark. ""What the hell is this?""

""Don't cause a scene, Elena,"" Adrian's voice was terrifyingly calm.

Causing a scene?

A disbelieving gasp escaped me, and I staggered back.

For eight years, I had suppressed my own Royal Alpha blood, turned down a career I dreamed of, and cut myself off from my friends, all because he kept insisting, ""The time isn't right.""

""I'm causing a scene?"" My voice trembled. ""You're the one who made a fool of me!""

I walked toward him, needing an explanation, needing him to say this was all a misunderstanding.

But Adrian pushed me away, his touch cold and dismissive.

Like he was shoving away a stranger, a nuisance.

""That's enough. It's time for you to go.""

That push was crueler than any words.

The whispers around us erupted into a storm of murmurs.

""Poor woman. Used as a replacement and didn't even know it.""

""Did she really think the Blackwood pack would want an outsider as their Luna?""

""Look at the kid. He's not a pureblood. Just a mutt.""

Every word was a knife, twisting in my heart.

""Adrian, please tell me this isn't real,"" my voice broke into a sob. ""We have Gale. We're a family!""

""A family?"" Sophia suddenly spoke, her voice sickeningly sweet. She glided in front of me, a victor's smile on her face. ""My dear Elena, haven't you figured it out yet?""

She stroked the true mark on her own neck, the one that glowed with silver light.

""That little trinket on your neck,"" she said, pointing at me with a perfectly manicured nail, ""cost Adrian a hundred thousand dollars. He bought it from some decrepit Blood-Sorceress.""

""It was forged in a full-moon ritual using Adrian's own blood. It doesn't just mimic a mark's scent; its true purpose was to cloud your senses and dull your instincts, trapping you in an illusion of love.""

One hundred thousand dollars.

He spent a hundred thousand dollars to weave the perfect lie.

""You've lived in that lie for eight years,"" Sophia's smile widened. ""The pack's entire inner circle knew the truth. You were the only fool kept in the dark.""

She lifted her chin smugly. ""See the difference? A real mark pulses with the heartbeat, glows softly when a mate is near. And yours? It's nothing more than a scar left by dead magic.""

My legs started to give out.

""No... that's impossible...""

""Mommy?"" Gale's timid voice cut through the noise. He was clutching his medal, his small face pale. ""Is what Dad said... true? Is the mark a fake?""

He walked cautiously toward Adrian, looking up at the Alpha he had called 'Dad' for eight years.

""Dad, tell me it's not true."" Gale’s eyes were filled with hope, the pure, innocent trust a child has for his father.

Adrian looked down at him, his eyes empty of any warmth.

""Let go."" He roughly shook off the small hand clutching his trousers.

Gale stumbled backward, his small body slamming hard into a cold stone pillar.

""Ah!"" The boy cried out in pain.

The medal clattered to the ground.

That medal was the proof of how amazing he was—proof he’d earned by training for three months, even competing with an injured arm, all so his 'dad' would see him shine.

Sophia sauntered over in her high heels.

She glanced down at the gold medal on the floor, and then, with a deliberate, cruel slowness, she brought her heel down and stomped on it.

A sharp crack echoed as the medal split in two.

""Little mutt,"" she sneered, ""you will never be worthy of the Blackwood pack.""

She ground the shattered medal under her heel, her eyes gleaming with malice. ""Just like your mother. Both of you, shameless fakes.""

""No!"" Gale cried, scrambling for it. ""That's mine!""

Seeing my son humiliated like this, something inside me snapped.

I lunged forward to protect him.

But before I could reach him, a cold hand clamped down on my shoulder.

Chapter 2

""Elena.""

Victoria’s voice was like ice, each syllable laced with the authority of her rank.

Adrian’s mother, the former Luna of the Blackwood pack, stood elegantly behind me.

She walked toward the broken medal, her gaze filled with disgust.

""You shouldn't have brought this mutt to defile our sacred gathering.""

With a disdainful kick, she sent the broken medal flying toward a trash can in the corner of the garden. ""We don't welcome things of inferior blood here.""

""No!"" Gale let out a heart-wrenching scream.

He stumbled toward the trash can, his small hands digging frantically through the filth. ""That's mine… I trained for three months for that…""

His voice was choked with sobs, tears streaming down his face.

I saw the bandage on his arm begin to soak with fresh blood.

For that medal, he had trained late into the night, refusing to stop even when he was hurt.

After every session, he would ask me, ""Mommy, will Dad be proud of me?""

And I always said, ""Of course, baby. Dad will see how amazing you are.""

""He is your grandson!"" I screamed at Victoria, my voice raw.

""I have no such embarrassing grandson,"" Victoria scoffed. ""A half-blood, worthy of the Blackwood name? Don't make me laugh.""

""Please…"" Gale cried, pulling the broken pieces from the trash. ""It's my most precious thing… Please don't throw it away…""

Seeing my eight-year-old son kneeling by the garbage, my heart felt like it was being ripped from my chest.

The royal blood I had suppressed for eight years began to boil, a powerful Alpha aura leaking from me, raw and uncontrolled.

""Gale, don't cry. Come to Mommy."" I tried to go to him, but Victoria blocked my path.

""Elena, control your whelp.""

""Poor little thing,"" Sophia cooed, walking up to me.

""Still daydreaming."" She suddenly gave me a hard shove.

I stumbled back, my spine slamming against the sharp edge of the stone steps.

A searing pain shot through me.

""Mommy!"" Seeing me hurt, Gale dropped the broken medal and ran toward me without a second thought. ""Mommy, are you okay?""

He was already weak from Adrian shoving him into the pillar.

He was running so fast now that his little face was flushed red.

""I'm okay, baby, I'm okay…"" I reached out for him.

But Gale's foot slipped.

Time seemed to stand still.

I saw his small body falling toward the stone steps, I saw the terror in his eyes, and I heard my own desperate scream.

""NO—""

A sickening CRACK echoed as his head slammed into the sharp corner of a step.

Blood gushed out instantly, staining the white stone red.

""Gale!"" I scrambled to him and pulled him into my arms.

My hands were immediately covered in warm blood.

""It's okay, baby, Mommy's here…"" But there was so much blood.

His little face was turning pale as paper.

""Adrian! Call the pack doctor!"" I screamed, my voice thick with tears.

Adrian just stood there, watching it all unfold with a detached expression.

""Stop the act, Elena.""

Act?

I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

""Your son is bleeding!"" I shrieked hysterically.

""He's a werewolf. He has regenerative abilities. He's not going to die,"" Adrian’s voice was chillingly calm. ""Did you really think a stunt like this would win you any sympathy?""

Regenerative ability?

Gale had never shifted, never awakened his wolf.

He didn't have strong regenerative abilities!

I didn't have time to explain.

I tried to pick Gale up and run, but two pack warriors blocked my way.

""Get out of my way! He needs a doctor!""

""Ma'am, please calm down,"" one of them said, his face a blank mask. ""Don't disturb the ceremony.""

I looked back at Adrian.

He was kneeling in front of Sophia, gently fixing a strand of her hair that the wind had misplaced.

He was completely ignoring his dying son.

""Mommy…"" Gale's voice was a faint whisper.

He struggled to lift his small hand, still clutching the broken pieces of his medal.

Blood dripped from between his fingers, stark and horrifying in the moonlight.

He tried to open his eyes, looking at me with confusion and hurt.

""Mommy… I just wanted Dad… to see I was strong…""

With those words, his eyes fluttered shut, his small body going limp.

The small body in my arms was growing colder.

Chapter 3

I shoved the two warriors aside with all my strength.

""Get out of my way!"" Desperation gave me a power I never knew I had.

I scooped Gale up and ran for the main gate like a madwoman.

He felt lighter in my arms, his breathing growing fainter.

A horrifying trail of crimson marked my path on the ground.

""Hang on, baby. Mommy's taking you to a doctor.""

I reached the parking lot, fumbling to open the car door.

I jammed the key in the ignition and twisted.

Nothing.

""No, no, no…"" I twisted the key again and again.

The engine just made a choked, clicking sound before falling silent.

Someone had tampered with my car.

An image of Sophia’s triumphant face flashed in my mind.

""That bitch!"" I cursed, picking Gale up and running back.

I needed to borrow a car.

I needed to beg someone for help.

But as I reached the garden entrance, I saw a sight that shattered my heart.

Adrian was kneeling before Sophia, gently wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.

""It's okay, don't be scared,"" his voice was softer than I had ever heard it. ""That crazy woman won't bother you again.""

""Adrian, I'm begging you!"" I dropped to my knees in front of him.

Gale was unconscious in my arms, his face as white as a sheet. ""Save him! He's your blood! He's called you Dad for eight years!""

Tears blurred my vision, but I could clearly see that Adrian didn't even glance down at Gale.

""That's enough, Elena. Your act is pathetic.""

I was holding my dying son, sobbing my heart out on the ground.

He called it an act?

""He's dying!"" My voice shattered. ""He's only eight!""

""A child of my bloodline doesn't die so easily,"" Adrian said, standing up and dusting off his pants. ""I know you're jealous of me and Sophia, but you don't have to resort to such vicious lies.""

""Ma'am, I'll take you."" A young voice spoke up.

Adrian's Beta, Tyler, was suddenly beside me.

Without asking for permission, he gently took Gale from my arms.

""Quick! Get in the car!""

The car sped through the night.

I held my son tightly, feeling his life slipping away.

His body was getting colder, his breathing shallower.

""Faster, please, go faster!""

""I'm already at top speed,"" Tyler’s voice was tense. ""Hang on, we're almost there.""

But of all the terrible luck, we got into a car crash right in front of the emergency room.

""Luna, I'll handle the accident! You get Gale to a doctor! I promised the Alpha I'd take care of—""

""Doctor! Help!"" Gale was a dead weight in my arms.

I didn't hear the rest of what Tyler said.

I just grabbed my bloody son and ran inside.

The heavy doors swung shut.

The red light above the door lit up.

I collapsed onto a cold chair, my hands covered in my son's blood.

It was still warm, as if he had just been talking in my arms moments ago.

Suddenly, Adrian's voice echoed in my head through the mind link.

I took a deep breath and answered.

""Elena, where are you?"" His tone was rushed, as if he wanted to calm me down quickly. ""I know you're angry. I didn't expect my mother to do that. But trust me, this is just a temporary measure!""

""A temporary measure?"" my voice was a hoarse whisper.

""For the good of the pack, I need to mate with Sophia. But I swear to you, my heart is only with you. Once I've secured my position as Alpha…""

The good of the pack?

My son was fighting for his life, and he was talking about the pack?

""Your son is dying!""

""Enough! Stop threatening me with that. He has werewolf blood, his healing is strong enough. There's no way he's in any real danger!""

I heard a door open on his end.

Adrian, in his arrogance, hadn't even bothered to close the mind link.

""Darling, did that crazy woman give you any more trouble?"" Sophia's sweet voice dripped with venom.

""No, my love,"" Adrian’s voice was gentle.

""You're so clever, fooling her with that fake mark for so long,"" Sophia giggled. ""If I hadn't needed time to clean up my own mess in Europe, you wouldn't have been stuck playing house with her for so long.""

Playing house.

There it was again.

""Elena was just a substitute I found while you were away,"" Adrian's breathing grew heavy, as if he was lost in Sophia's kisses. ""Now that I've gotten what I needed from her, it's time to get rid of her.""

""What about the little wolf pup? Won't you feel guilty if he actually dies?"" Sophia's voice was closer now.

""Guilty about what?"" Adrian scoffed. ""He's just a mutt. He's not a threat. This is all just a game Elena is playing.""

Tears streamed down my face as I cut the link.

I couldn't listen anymore.

Eight years.

My entire eight-year union was an elaborate, carefully planned lie.

Everything I had given up for him meant nothing.

I was just a substitute, a plaything.

And my son, the boy who asked me every day, ""When is Daddy coming home?"" was nothing but a ""mutt"" to him.

The emergency room doors opened.

A doctor took off his mask and walked toward me, his eyes full of apology.

""I'm so sorry. We did everything we could. The child lost too much blood, and… he didn't have a werewolf's regenerative abilities…""

A primal howl of pure agony tore from my throat.

The next second, I threw myself onto Gale's cold, still body.

For eight long years, my Gale had lived like a rogue, never accepted by his father's pack.

I just wanted to hear him call me 'Mommy' one more time.

But now, he just lay there.

His sweet face was colorless, so quiet, as if he had never been in this world at all.

Fueled by overwhelming grief and rage, the ancient seal that had suppressed my power for eight years shattered into dust.

A primal and pure Alpha power erupted from me, so immense that every werewolf in the hospital felt it and dropped to their knees in terror.

I held Gale and cried all night.

When the sun rose, I shakily called my father to handle Gale's arrangements.

Then, I went home, clutching Gale's last belongings.

The broken medal I’d fished from the trash, and his favorite stuffed toy.

The moment I pushed open the door, the cloying, tangled scents of Adrian and Sophia hit me like a physical blow.

They dared…

On the night my son died, in our home, they were celebrating their victory.

Chapter 4

I stood in the doorway, my eyes fixed on Sophia’s coat hanging from the staircase banister.

Right where Gale used to love to slide down.

Footsteps sounded from upstairs.

Adrian descended the stairs gracefully, with a disheveled Sophia trailing behind him.

When they saw me, Adrian's eyes narrowed slightly.

""Elena, you're back."" His gaze swept over me. ""Your scent… it's different.""

He studied me, a flicker of confusion in his eyes before they iced over once more.

He straightened the cuffs of his shirt.

""Never mind. It doesn't matter. There's something I need to tell you.""

I clutched the bundle in my arms tighter.

""Tomorrow afternoon at two is my official mating ceremony with Sophia,"" Adrian announced calmly. ""The pack Elders will preside.""

""Mating ceremony?"" my voice was a rasp.

""That's right,"" Sophia said, linking her arm through Adrian's, her face glowing with triumph.

""We'll be formally bonded before the altar of the Moon Goddess. You're welcome to come. Though…""

Her eyes landed on the bundle in my arms with disgust.

""And what is that? Are you dragging that filth into my home now?""

I carefully placed the bundle on the coffee table.

""Gale is dead."" My voice was quiet, but it echoed in the silent living room.

Adrian paused his cuff-adjusting for a second, then continued.

""Elena, this act of yours is getting more and more pathetic.""

""Acting?"" I couldn't believe it. ""My son is dead!""

""Enough,"" Adrian said, his gaze cold. ""Are you still sticking to that lie? How could my bloodline not have regenerative abilities?!""

""He's really dead!"" I screamed. ""Head trauma! He bled out!""

""Then why are you here?"" Sophia sneered. ""If he were really dead, wouldn't you be busy burying him?""

She had a point.

If a child truly died, what mother would come home so quickly?

""Elena,"" Adrian shook his head. ""I can't believe your stubbornness. You've become a pathological liar.""

""It's not a lie!"" I lunged for the bundle, wanting to unwrap it and show them.

But Adrian grabbed my wrist.

""Elena, drop the act,"" his grip was like iron. ""I'm not changing my mind because of your threats.""

""Sophia will be my one and only Luna."" Every word was a dagger in my heart. ""Pack your things. Be out of here by tomorrow.""

""This is our home!""

""No, this is property of the Blackwood pack,"" Adrian corrected me. ""You were merely a temporary resident.""

Sophia smirked.

""Elena, don't be so tasteless. You've enjoyed a life that wasn't yours for eight years. You should be grateful.""

""I gave everything for this family!""

""Gave?"" Adrian scoffed. ""What did you give? You spent my money, lived in my house, and used my status to show off.""

""I suppressed who I am for you!""

""That was your choice.""

I looked at this man, the man I had loved for eight years.

The way he looked at me now, it was like he was looking at a crazy stranger.

""I told you, Gale is really dead,"" I tried one last time.

""Elena,"" Adrian's voice turned dangerous. ""If you repeat that vicious lie one more time, don't blame me for what happens next.""

""Slander?""

""Making up your child's death to get sympathy, what else would you call it?"" Sophia stood up. ""Adrian, don't waste any more time on this woman.""

I looked at the bundle on the table, which seemed to radiate a cold stillness.

No one believed me.

Even my son's death was just a performance in their eyes.

On the back of my neck, the fake mark, battered by the raw power of my unleashed royal blood, began to flake away like dead skin, revealing the pure, unblemished skin beneath.

""I'll go,"" I said, struggling to my feet. ""But you will regret this.""

""Regret what?"" Sophia laughed. ""Regret getting rid of a nuisance like you?""

I walked toward the door.

""Just you wait.""

————

Adrian's POV

The next afternoon.

The Blackwood pack's mating ceremony was held at the ancient altar of the Moon Goddess.

The Elder's voice boomed, reciting the sacred vows as every pack member watched the holy moment.

The statue of the Moon Goddess looked solemn in the candlelight.

""Adrian Blackwood, do you willingly accept Sophia as your mate…""

The ceremony was proceeding smoothly.

But Adrian couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong.

Elena's behavior yesterday…

He had assumed she was just struggling to accept his relationship with Sophia and was acting out for his attention.

But today, she was nowhere to be seen.

He had planned to wait until this was over, until he had the full power of an Alpha, to go and explain everything to Elena.

The mark was fake, but his love for her, he told himself, had never been.

A wave of panic suddenly washed over him.

""Where is Tyler?"" He suddenly remembered telling Tyler to go help Elena last night, but he'd never heard back.

The mind link wasn't connecting.

He sent Tyler a text.

Go check on Elena and Gale. See what they're doing.

The ceremony continued.

""And now, the couple will exchange vows…""

Just then, Tyler burst into the ceremonial grounds.

He was pale, his forehead beaded with sweat.

""Alpha!"" he cried, rushing to Adrian, his voice trembling. ""Something's happened!""

Everyone stopped and stared.

""Gale… Gale is really dead!"" Tyler's voice was practically a shout. ""I just confirmed it with the hospital!""

Only to grow up and have them claim that I never asked or didn’t want them, but also ask me when I’m getting them as an adult and as a kid would constantly make comments about my teeth.

The dentists would recommend them on the rare occasions that we even visited. golden child of course got braces. They claimed I never asked to do extra curriculars.

I would ask for money to go out, they’d guilt over that and refuse to while giving money for siblings. They’d barely by clothes or undergarments.

They never claimed I didn’t ask for things when it came time to do their weird religous shit, cutting hair weirdly, or whatever they wanted, which wasn’t much because again they were losers.

I suspect there was some overlap there and that's when she started cutting me out of her life but frankly, it's none of my business.

One year ago, on a random Saturday, she texts me a bunch of pictures of them at the courthouse, obviously having just gotten married. To say I was hurt would be a huge understatement. Not only had I not been invited, a burn itself, I had no idea it was going to happen. The day before, I was outside her workplace, offering to bring her a coffee, as I do on occasion, and she said she had the day off - the opportunities to tell me were plentiful. She actively chose to hide it from me for months (the paperwork takes at least 4 weeks here), robbing me of the opportunity to get over the initial hurt but still be a part of her day - send her flowers, a card, a text.

I went radio silent for a few weeks because I would not have been able to talk about it maturely. We eventually met up and talked about it. She didn't take any accountability, defended her actions by saying she knew I would be angry and took the opportunity to also let me know they're having a family only wedding at a church abroad this summer. I'm not family, no exceptions. 

This actually made it worse for me. It was like another slap to the face because I consider her family. She wants to be my midwife one day, I have invited her to every family event because that’s what I thought we were, my wedding, my daughter’s christening- would have made her godmother if she was married.

With her wedding coming up, I don't know what to do. Half of me wants to find a local florist in spite of this and have an arrangement sent and cry about it home alone, and the other half wants to cut her out completely as I can't fathom pretending things are fine with someone who can so easily hurt me so deeply and not even recognize it.

I guess it's normal there's always one person who cares more for the other and it is usually me, but to what extent is it fair and where do you set a boundary. Am I exaggerating and making her day about me, or is this relationship no longer worth investing in?",3,1754979517.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False
